Informatique & Architecture, son diplôme d'ingénieur en poche, elle prend en charge tout le back-office des applis et des services Internet d'AboutGoods Company, sans parler de notre R&D et du programme très innovant de Semantic Web soutenu par OSEO.



Informatique et Développement, sa licence de développeur en cours le plonge dans la conception et développement des applis mobiles de la famille KOA, au premier rang desquelles se trouve la super appli TamenKoa?, c'est tout dire.



Marketing & Usages, la grande spécialiste des stratégies gagnantes, qu'elle enseigne aussi à ses étudiants de Licence et Master Infocom. Elle met l'expertise de son agence NEVE au coeur du projet des applis KOA. 





Images et Signes, c'est lui, c'est son truc depuis ses débuts dans les agences de com les plus prestigieuses et avec lui, les signes doivent dire ce qu'ils veulent dire. Il met avec sa complice Noémie l'expérience de son agence SPAAARK au service du projet des applis KOA.

</div></div>","Ever wish your arms were just a little bit longer to make sure EVERYONE is in the frame of your Selfie? Or you simply want to take a solo Selfie with more than just your head in the shot?

Well Now You Can!

With either of these 2 Bluetooth® low-energy devices, you can now take a Selfie using these remote control units. Tiny, slim, lightweight. We know, we know, you've been searching everywhere, but now it's here. 

                     
...but there's more!
Both Tags also double as an alarm! If you lose anything they are attached to within 50 feet, they will make your Smartphone ring to notify you.  
We know, A-Mazing!
And the best part is, they are ready to go! You won't be waiting months for updates on production & development. We've spent a lot of time and effort to make sure these Tags are ready now, plus, we've added loads of extra features!




SMART TAG:The black remote control unit (the SmartTag) will activate the camera in your Smartphone by simply pressing the gray button. Just ""click"" & you're done!          (10-second self-timer option included)      


The bonus feature in this unit is its AUDIBLE ALARM. You simply pair the unit with your Smartphone (via the free app), then clip the SmartTag (key chain included) to anything: your keys, a backpack, purse, etc., and if you drop or leave behind your keys, backpack, etc., your SmartTag will ring AND your cell phone will also ring to alert you! 
Lost Your Phone Again? Your Tag Will Find It!


Tag What's Important to You...  




You can also tap the ""Find Me"" icon on the phone to make your Tagged item ring if you've lost it. There is also a map 'PIN-DROP' feature which shows you WHERE you lost it. And just in case you realize you've lost your item AND your phone battery died, simply plug in your phone charger & check the map locator in the app! 

...but there's even MORE! If you lose your phone, just press the button on the Tag & your phone will instantly ring to let you know where you left it! 


WalletTag:The smaller white remote control unit (the WalletTag) will activate the camera in your Smartphone by simply pressing the red button. Just ""click"" and you're done! The special feature in this unit is its SILENT ALARM. You simply pair the WalletTag with your Smartphone (via the free app), then place this super slim tag (3mm - the world's thinnest Bluetooth tracking device yet!) in your wallet or purse and if you drop or leave your wallet/purse/tagged item behind, your cell phone will ring to alert you within 50 feet! 
          

There is also a map 'PIN-DROP' feature which shows you WHERE you lost your tagged item. And just in case you realize you've lost your item AND your phone battery died, simply plug in your phone charger & check the map locator in the app!

What makes watching the big game at a bar or at home ten times more exciting than being at the live game? 
SmackTalk.
 
What is our company all about?
SmackTalk is an app for making light-hearted bets with friends in social situations. SmackTalk is first and foremost a way for friends to make small wagers, like for the cost of a beer or a basket of fries, while enjoying sports events.
SmackTalk takes the awkwardness out of exchanging money between friends and promotes fun friendly competition. 
 
How does it work? Why should I get it?
It’s simple. To play SmackTalk, simply download the app, enter in your credit card information, which is securely stored, and SMACK... you are connected with your friends & ready to set a wager.
Live stats stream through the app to inspire your betting or help with less stat savvy players.  The app also validates any bet made between friends to keep “who won” out of the discussion.
 
How is it legal?
The money exchanged between friends though SmackTalk is a legal transaction because the money is considered a gift and we do not make a profit off other people’s wagers.
 
Is the gambling market really that big?
Juniper Research estimates that betting on mobile devices alone will be a $100 billion worldwide industry by 2017.
According to an ESPN survey, about 118 million Americans gambled on sports in some manner in 2008.
So... yes. Mobile gambling is really that big.
 
How will we make money?
We envision three potential revenue streams could be generated by SmackTalk.
The first is simply from charging users a small fee to download the app.
The second is from advertising sales-- any ad that would fly on espn could potentially find its way onto SmackTalk.
The last way we imagine making money is from data that will be mined from each user: significant bits of information like demographics, location, food and drink preferences.

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Plans</h3>
<p>I'll be constructing the photovoltaic array from scratch, working with 6x6 inch silicon solar cells and soldering them together in series.  The cells will be mounted on a 3x6 sheet of twin-wall corrugated polypropylene sheeting, and protected on top with an identically sized sheet of yellowing-resistant acrylic sheeting.  The array will be framed with angled aluminum, and sealed with silicone caulking.  I have constructed a number of solar panels in the past, and this is the cheapest and lightest method I have found.  The panel will produce 48V in full sun, but will experience lower voltages under cloudy or overcast conditions.  This electricity is fed into a solar regulator circuit and converts a range of 24-50V into a constant 24V with variable current.  A 24V motor controller is powered by the resulting electricity, and sends the power to the rear mounted 300W brushed motor.  The resulting setup will enable up to 300W of readily available power to be used and and controlled by a twist throttle on the handlebars.  Under full sunlight, 300 watts should be able to sustain 15-20mph on flat surfaces without pedaling, and provide significant assistance for climbing up hills.</p>

<h3>A Little More About Me</h3>
<p>I've been fascinated with all kinds of technology from an early age.  I built my first software program at age 13 which I've been selling online ever since, I did a complete overhaul of the electrical and battery systems of a Razor scooter when I was 14, I opened a small business repairing Apple products at age 16, I began outfitting bicycles with small 2 stroke gasoline engines and selling them at age 17, I started building solar panels at age 18, and I recently created a script that provides instant notifications of ticket availability for a number of Comedy Central shows, which has had tremendous success on the internet so far.  I've loved working on all of these little projects, and I'm always looking for something new to do.  I've considered buying or building an electric bicycle for some time now, but battery technology is highly inefficient and quite costly.  I have always been fascinated by the free readily available power that can be harnessed with solar panels, and I think it has great potential for single-person transportation.  With your help, I'd like to turn this from an idea into a working product.</p>

<li>$200 or more: I'll use CAD software and a 3D printer to make a small model of the trike and send it to you.</li>
<li>$400 or more: I'll build another trike and sell it to you for cost of parts + $50.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I am embarking on this project to demonstrate how solar technology can be used for transportation without the need for expensive, heavy batteries.  Batteries take a lot of resources to produce, and their short lifespans makes them less economically viable, and worse for the environment.</p>
<p>If I succeed in building a working prototype for a reasonable cost, I would like to attempt to commercialize the product.  Your financial assistance will help move this project along into what hopefully becomes a marketable product.</p>

<h3>Hello, Indiegogo !</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536881728/t3c1r5awhhlhmx4igcp7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>my name is Silvio Pitteri and I am an Italian materials engineer, 58, living in Bruxelles, that after 25 years of work in R&amp;D (tribology, surface engineering, composites, polymers...) and in the plastic industry, needed a change and some action with aluminium: the PlyGo foldable stand became the obvious answer to that compelling need of making something challenging out of aluminium, while on the contrary, if that need had targeted another material, like for instance linear low density polyethylene, none of my relatives, friends and customers would nowadays be so familiar and fulfilled with that little foldable quadruped named PlyGo.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536882338/mzcdsgqjntmkqsyblbaq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>PlyGo is made with high quality components that are either reusable or recyclable. Its aluminium bars are protected by anodization and come in five standard colours (black, blue, orange, green and ""natural aluminium""), making of PlyGo an elegant, stable, strong, repairable and durable friend.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537018977/yac6jsw1qobyt83s6g9z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The innovative and original ""plank-free"" concept on which PlyGo is based has allowed it to evolve into a foldable and highly configurable stand that can be comfortably and ergonomically adapted to various usage situations, with all kinds of laptops and tablets, adhering to PlyGo thanks to Velcro strips: when sitting at the desk or on an armchair, when lying in bed, when travelling, when tele-working from home or from Internet cafes, and this without feeling unpleasant pressures or heat on the body, without assuming bad postures, and without risking falls of laptops or tablets.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536881933/rbgqetofpgsdx7etszfw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Which makes PlyGo particularly attractive for people who often use their laptop or tablet from home, either because they telework, or because they are ill or disabled. Or, to the other extreme PlyGo is attractive also for people always on the move, like business men, managers, tourists, travelers…</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537019620/u1xkrteghvni2h6jtwzq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Nowadays PlyGo is not anymore perceived as a kind of UFO, i. e. an Unidentified Folding Object, because this cool, ergonomic, foldable &amp; portable laptop stand is getting more and more noticed by the people and by the internet world, which appreciate its qualities, special features and advantages: the very positive reactions of visitors during the Concours Lépine 2016 in Paris (bronze medal), of spectators following its TV appearances, and of world-wide backers during a previous successful Kickstarter Campaign, demonstrate that many people are very keen on PlyGo, as soon as they have seen it in action.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536883839/xq8nasxbpuklkfhopacw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The selling price to the public of PlyGo, about 69 Euros, is justified by the high quality, portability,  and versatility of this new and very innovative stand, and this Indiegogo crowdfunding project will further provide a large visibility to PlyGo: after an early life in the form of prototypes, PlyGo has recently reached the “400 sold” target and has had a large production of 150, which makes it available for your purchase under its five standard colours.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536883937/edruijcufdbblen8ugqz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Recently some new accessories were created and made available in order to further improve the PlyGo experience: they consist of (a) two thin and transparent plastic shapes used to hold the pages of books, of (b) two 30 mm long spacers, to either increase the height of the stand arms, or to hold books over such spacers, and of (c)  two little removable plates covered by expanded rubber, that on one side adhere to the velcro-covered arms of PlyGo, and that on the other become the new anti-skid contact surface to support laptops, with no more need of sticking velcro strips on laptop bottoms.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537010311/jofklvqndzxkoy6gj453.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536884283/urii4dmieka48terdscl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Producing PlyGo does not present particular difficulties, because there are several approved suppliers for each of the PlyGo' s components and the prices are under control, as is under control the assembly phase and the reproducibility of the excellent quality.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536884880/glfra3ebivumpaawlyn6.jpg"" src=""""/>So, PlyGo is already available to support you everywhere, and with your support we should soon be able to make new productions and reach the 1000 PlyGo sale target, particularly if the word gets spread; this would mean some serious assembly and shipping work for myself and my company partners, the confirmation that PlyGo is growing well, and... many more people appreciating the new PlyGo stand around the  world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536885145/bjxzosq1qyuas5htdwho.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To summarize, here are the main advantages and special features of PlyGo, that are seldom found among other laptop and tablet stands already on the market:</p>
<p><br/>1- PlyGo is one of the smallest (25x3x3 cm3) and lightest (300 g) portable stands.</p>
<p>2- PlyGo is the only small stand allowing to keep tablets, laptops and books above the abdomen and laps while resting, for a comfortable and posturally correct use on bed, sofa, armchair.</p>
<p>3- PlyGo is the only stand that can be adjusted in height (from 2 to 32 cm) and in width (from 29 to 52 cm) and in the inclination of its supporting base (all angles), for a good, ergonomic use when lying down or sitting at the desk.</p>
<p>4- PlyGo is the only small stand able to support laptops, tablets, e-readers, books and smart-phones of all sizes, on beds or on desks.</p>
<p>5- By lifting PC laptops in the air, above tables, cloths, carpets, blankets, cushions… PlyGo insures them an excellent cooling, thus extending their life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, position yourself comfortably, adapt the configuration of PlyGo to you ... And enjoy !</p>

my name is Silvio Pitteri and I am an Italian materials engineer, 58, living in Bruxelles, that after 25 years of work in R&D (tribology, surface engineering, composites, polymers...) and in the plastic industry, needed a change and some action with aluminium: the PlyGo foldable stand became the obvious answer to that compelling need of making something challenging out of aluminium, while on the contrary, if that need had targeted another material, like for instance linear low density polyethylene, none of my relatives, friends and customers would nowadays be so familiar and fulfilled with that little foldable quadruped named PlyGo.

PlyGo is made with high quality components that are either reusable or recyclable. Its aluminium bars are protected by anodization and come in five standard colours (black, blue, orange, green and ""natural aluminium""), making of PlyGo an elegant, stable, strong, repairable and durable friend.
The innovative and original ""plank-free"" concept on which PlyGo is based has allowed it to evolve into a foldable and highly configurable stand that can be comfortably and ergonomically adapted to various usage situations, with all kinds of laptops and tablets, adhering to PlyGo thanks to Velcro strips: when sitting at the desk or on an armchair, when lying in bed, when travelling, when tele-working from home or from Internet cafes, and this without feeling unpleasant pressures or heat on the body, without assuming bad postures, and without risking falls of laptops or tablets.

Which makes PlyGo particularly attractive for people who often use their laptop or tablet from home, either because they telework, or because they are ill or disabled. Or, to the other extreme PlyGo is attractive also for people always on the move, like business men, managers, tourists, travelers…

Nowadays PlyGo is not anymore perceived as a kind of UFO, i. e. an Unidentified Folding Object, because this cool, ergonomic, foldable & portable laptop stand is getting more and more noticed by the people and by the internet world, which appreciate its qualities, special features and advantages: the very positive reactions of visitors during the Concours Lépine 2016 in Paris (bronze medal), of spectators following its TV appearances, and of world-wide backers during a previous successful Kickstarter Campaign, demonstrate that many people are very keen on PlyGo, as soon as they have seen it in action.

The selling price to the public of PlyGo, about 69 Euros, is justified by the high quality, portability,  and versatility of this new and very innovative stand, and this Indiegogo crowdfunding project will further provide a large visibility to PlyGo: after an early life in the form of prototypes, PlyGo has recently reached the “400 sold” target and has had a large production of 150, which makes it available for your purchase under its five standard colours.

Recently some new accessories were created and made available in order to further improve the PlyGo experience: they consist of (a) two thin and transparent plastic shapes used to hold the pages of books, of (b) two 30 mm long spacers, to either increase the height of the stand arms, or to hold books over such spacers, and of (c)  two little removable plates covered by expanded rubber, that on one side adhere to the velcro-covered arms of PlyGo, and that on the other become the new anti-skid contact surface to support laptops, with no more need of sticking velcro strips on laptop bottoms.


Producing PlyGo does not present particular difficulties, because there are several approved suppliers for each of the PlyGo' s components and the prices are under control, as is under control the assembly phase and the reproducibility of the excellent quality.
So, PlyGo is already available to support you everywhere, and with your support we should soon be able to make new productions and reach the 1000 PlyGo sale target, particularly if the word gets spread; this would mean some serious assembly and shipping work for myself and my company partners, the confirmation that PlyGo is growing well, and... many more people appreciating the new PlyGo stand around the  world.

 
To summarize, here are the main advantages and special features of PlyGo, that are seldom found among other laptop and tablet stands already on the market:
1- PlyGo is one of the smallest (25x3x3 cm3) and lightest (300 g) portable stands.
2- PlyGo is the only small stand allowing to keep tablets, laptops and books above the abdomen and laps while resting, for a comfortable and posturally correct use on bed, sofa, armchair.
3- PlyGo is the only stand that can be adjusted in height (from 2 to 32 cm) and in width (from 29 to 52 cm) and in the inclination of its supporting base (all angles), for a good, ergonomic use when lying down or sitting at the desk.
4- PlyGo is the only small stand able to support laptops, tablets, e-readers, books and smart-phones of all sizes, on beds or on desks.
5- By lifting PC laptops in the air, above tables, cloths, carpets, blankets, cushions… PlyGo insures them an excellent cooling, thus extending their life.
 
So, position yourself comfortably, adapt the configuration of PlyGo to you ... And enjoy !

Carper (“Max”) is the founder of Post
It Find It, and is also the Sr. Software Engineer who will be building it.<span>  Here’s a little background on Max:  </span>
<p>Max grew up in the city of University Place, WA, about
30 miles south of Seattle, and has lived in Seattle, San Diego, Honolulu, and now
Austin, Texas.<span>  His parents bought him
his first computer (a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A) when he was 4 years old.  The TI-99/4A booted into BASIC (a programming
language), so Max’s curiosity led him to experiment with it.  He was making small programs in BASIC by the
time he was 7.  Max got his first consulting
job for Microsoft at 18, and continued to use consulting opportunities throughout
his career to build and enrich his skills in C#/BASIC Programming, Database
Administration and Development, and I.T. Systems Engineering/Administration.  He has consulted for Fortune 500 companies
such as Microsoft, Accenture, AT&amp;T Wireless, Chase Bank (formerly
Washington Mutual), and Holland America/Princess Cruises.  In his late twenties, Max designed and built
a casino promotions and business intelligence system called “SPPRB” that competed
with other promotions systems from much larger, more well-established
companies.  Before his 30<sup>th</sup>
birthday, a 2,500-slot casino/resort near San Diego liked SPPRB enough to choose
it over the larger competitors’ offerings, and paid him a six-figure amount for a license.
Max recently left a full-time position
as a Sr. Software Engineer for an industry-leading biotech company called
Luminex (<a href=""http://www.luminexcorp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.luminexcorp.com</a>) to found
Post It Find It.</span></p>

few years, you’ve probably noticed that the options out there are far from
perfect.  It seems like whenever you’re
trying to buy something, you either can’t find what you’re looking for at all,
or have hundreds of postings to sift through, with no good way to sort or
filter them.  When you’re trying to sell something, you have to re-post your
ad every few days just to get it noticed, otherwise, it falls to the
bottom of the haystack, and no one can find it.

<p> </p>
<p>We are a team of mechanical technician, precious metal expert, systems engineer and designers with very creative ideas. We like to think of ourselves as individuals that do not just think outside the box but outside the room the box is in, but in the same time keeping in mind that the basics in the box is just as important.</p>

<p><strong>Extra input</strong></p>
<p>Peter brier: Is an all-round ""maker"": tinkering with Electronics, optics, mechanics and software. He seeks to make technology available to others. Via his work in the last 15 years for industry and research, but also in various open-source and educational projects. Currently he is also working on 3D printing of food (for a dutch independent research institute), and making open source laser controllers available to everyone (<a href=""http://www.LaosLaser.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.LaosLaser.org</a>).</p>
<p>Peter will help during development with generic stuff (software, printhead/encoder interfacing) all his work will be open source.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the i-AM 3D  ??</strong></p>
<p>i-AM 3D ( ink additive manufacturing 3D )</p>
<p>Unlike most other 3D printers that use a plastic filament or a powder as material to build a part the i-AM 3D uses a liquid ink as material that is deposited with an inkjet print head according to the design.</p>
<p>The ink is then cured (sintered) by means of a laser that is guided by galvometer scanners.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where are we in the process</strong> <strong> ??</strong></p>
<p>At this stage most of the hardware, electronics and software of the machine is done and we have a functional machine (printer) Albeit with a test print head (ink shield – Nicholas C Lewis – a Kickstarter project )</p>
<p>We won’t bore you with all the hard and software spec’s, but If you really want to know just drop us a mail and we will share with you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for the laser and Galvo optics, we must yet purchase together with the correct print head and drive electronics’.</p>
<p align=""right""> </p>
<p>That is where we need your help, so we can buy the correct Print head, Galvo scanners and laser to finish the prototype machine and start testing the parts. (Density, tensile strength and durability) to make the i-AM 3D printer a reality.</p>
<p><strong>About the ink (material)</strong></p>
<p>We experimented with a lot of ideas and processes to come up with the perfect product(ink) for the application and believe that we now have three precious metal inks (gold, palladium and platinum) for the application process. (patent pending) More inks to follow, Titanium, Aluminum and alloys thereof.</p>
<p>The current inks were tested using the test print head and laser(hand held) and curing (Sinter) the ink in an oven at very low temperatures.</p>
<p>Ink can be cured(sintered) on a wide variety of substrates.  Paper, plastic, metal ect.</p>
<p>The cured inks were also tested with a laser spectrometer (assayed) and returned positive results.</p>
<p><strong>Why ink ??</strong></p>
<p>With all other 3D metal printers (powder bed) you need a lot of extra material to manufacture (print) a  part. Example a powder bed printer with a build volume of 90mm x 90mm you would need 1 kg of metal powder (gold ) to start the process, although the metal powders is recyclable it comes at a very high price and for every different material you would need a kg to start off with.</p>
<p>With our concept and machine (printer) you would only need the amount of material that is needed to make the part and between 2 and 3 % extra.</p>
<p>That amounts to a huge saving in material and cost not to mention the minimal cost to the environment.</p>
<p>Our Inks contain only natural elements.</p>
<p>                         </p>
<p>Palladium metal ink</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Palladium metal ink printed on paper</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Palladium metal ink cured(sintered)</p>
<p>Fully cured into a metallic metal and 100% conductible</p>
<p>Assayed with laser spectrometer = 99.9% Palladium</p>
<p><strong>Project development</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once we have the prototype printer complete and all relevant test done, we will manufacture the final product (printer) that will go into production.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It will be a table top model </strong></p>
<p><strong>Dimensions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Length: 600mm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Width: 400mm  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Height: 480mm</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Print head with drive electronics</li>
<li>Galvometer scanner</li>
<li>High power laser</li>
<li>Conversion software</li>
</ol><p><strong>What you get</strong></p>
<p>Unlike most of the campaigns on Indiegogo whereby you can get some form of product, reward or a discounted price, our campaign is very different.</p>
<p>What we can offer is making you part of the machine, (printer) making you part of its DNA</p>
<p>I bet you are now very curious, so let me share with you how we will do it.</p>
<p>Every contributor’s image (sign, symbol or whatever image that represent you) will be part of the livery of every machine, furthermore the printer will have a full monitor as the front(face) that will be able to show videos, content, advertising, ect. and your image or will also be displayed.</p>
<p>Besides the above there is some other perks.</p>
<p>We are quietly confident that <strong>the i</strong>-AM 3D printer will be one of the first 3D printers that manufacture metal parts, to go into space as the printing process and application lends itself to it.</p>
<p>Most of us will most probably never get to space, but your image might just make it into space with the i-AM 3D</p>
<p>If you feel the need to help us make the i-AM 3d printer a reality but are unable to do so financially, please spread the word, use the Indiegogo share tools. Every bit of help we can get will help us all evolve and create a better world.</p>
<p>All donations received will go towards buying the parts as mentioned, even if we don’t make our target the funds will go towards buying the parts and we will honor our perks to all contributors.</p>

i-AM 3D ( ink additive manufacturing 3D )
Unlike most other 3D printers that use a plastic filament or a powder as material to build a part the i-AM 3D uses a liquid ink as material that is deposited with an inkjet print head according to the design.
The ink is then cured (sintered) by means of a laser that is guided by galvometer scanners.
 
Where are we in the process  ??
At this stage most of the hardware, electronics and software of the machine is done and we have a functional machine (printer) Albeit with a test print head (ink shield – Nicholas C Lewis – a Kickstarter project )
We won’t bore you with all the hard and software spec’s, but If you really want to know just drop us a mail and we will share with you.
 
As for the laser and Galvo optics, we must yet purchase together with the correct print head and drive electronics’.
 
That is where we need your help, so we can buy the correct Print head, Galvo scanners and laser to finish the prototype machine and start testing the parts. (Density, tensile strength and durability) to make the i-AM 3D printer a reality.
About the ink (material)
We experimented with a lot of ideas and processes to come up with the perfect product(ink) for the application and believe that we now have three precious metal inks (gold, palladium and platinum) for the application process. (patent pending) More inks to follow, Titanium, Aluminum and alloys thereof.
The current inks were tested using the test print head and laser(hand held) and curing (Sinter) the ink in an oven at very low temperatures.
Ink can be cured(sintered) on a wide variety of substrates.  Paper, plastic, metal ect.
The cured inks were also tested with a laser spectrometer (assayed) and returned positive results.
Why ink ??
With all other 3D metal printers (powder bed) you need a lot of extra material to manufacture (print) a  part. Example a powder bed printer with a build volume of 90mm x 90mm you would need 1 kg of metal powder (gold ) to start the process, although the metal powders is recyclable it comes at a very high price and for every different material you would need a kg to start off with.
With our concept and machine (printer) you would only need the amount of material that is needed to make the part and between 2 and 3 % extra.
That amounts to a huge saving in material and cost not to mention the minimal cost to the environment.
Our Inks contain only natural elements.
                         
Palladium metal ink
 
Palladium metal ink printed on paper
 
Palladium metal ink cured(sintered)
Fully cured into a metallic metal and 100% conductible
Assayed with laser spectrometer = 99.9% Palladium
Project development
Once we have the prototype printer complete and all relevant test done, we will manufacture the final product (printer) that will go into production.
It will be a table top model 
Dimensions:
Length: 600mm
Width: 400mm  
Height: 480mm
 
What we need

Print head with drive electronics
Galvometer scanner
High power laser
Conversion software
What you get
Unlike most of the campaigns on Indiegogo whereby you can get some form of product, reward or a discounted price, our campaign is very different.
What we can offer is making you part of the machine, (printer) making you part of its DNA
I bet you are now very curious, so let me share with you how we will do it.
Every contributor’s image (sign, symbol or whatever image that represent you) will be part of the livery of every machine, furthermore the printer will have a full monitor as the front(face) that will be able to show videos, content, advertising, ect. and your image or will also be displayed.
Besides the above there is some other perks.
We are quietly confident that the i-AM 3D printer will be one of the first 3D printers that manufacture metal parts, to go into space as the printing process and application lends itself to it.
Most of us will most probably never get to space, but your image might just make it into space with the i-AM 3D
If you feel the need to help us make the i-AM 3d printer a reality but are unable to do so financially, please spread the word, use the Indiegogo share tools. Every bit of help we can get will help us all evolve and create a better world.
All donations received will go towards buying the parts as mentioned, even if we don’t make our target the funds will go towards buying the parts and we will honor our perks to all contributors.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

sharing helps you become the coolest climber on social media


Premium topos made by local climbing professionals

A bad Internet connection in the mountains or a dense forest will no longer stop you from accessing the high quality topos 27crags.com offers.  While still at home, you can download topos onto your smartphone...




... and use them offline regardless of where you are...

.. and we mean anywhere you are.




GPS features help you navigate your way to the crag or boulder. No more wasting hours wandering around.






Plan your future climbs and add them to your to-do list. You can see the routes on a map and access them easily.






Follow your progress as a climber with the tick list. 





The intelligent route search shows you the most suitable climbing locations on a map. The search adapts to the routes you have climbed most recently and makes individualized suggestions for possible next projects or crags.



After a hard day of climbing you can share your heroic sends and artistic pictures with the climbing community. If you can’t climb as hard as your friend, you can always be the guy/girl who takes the best climbing shots, right?






At present 27crags.com has over 130,000 routes listed in its public database.



We are currently developing a premium topo database, which contains high quality rock climbing guidebooks from European countries made by local climbing professionals. 
You don't need to buy a local climbing guidebook anymore. We co-operate with the locals. By using our premium topos, you will also support the local climbing professionals to bolt new routes in their area. 
The premium topo database and locations will be published by the end of 2015. 

More than an app!
As soon as our campaign goal is met our development of the site takes next level. Almost 200 improvement requests from users are waiting to get implemented. Bolt crosses on sport routes, multipitch topos, intelligent route search, improved map etc. We are eager to complete all of them.



Let’s collaborate to make the best climbing software ever!

To reach our goal, we need your support, thoughts and comments on the project. Select a perk and order a subscription of the app in advance. The subscription will allow you to:

On April 25, 2015, a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal, killing over 8,500 people and destroying years of history in seconds. 


Many news outlets have now stopped their reporting on the Nepal earthquake that occurred just a few months ago. Thousands of people have lost their families and friends, and just as many have lost their homes, with thousands living in tent cities.

More than 25% of the Nepalese population have been living without electricity, even before the earthquake. This means that they spend every night dangerously in the dark and their lives stop when the sun goes down. We have found a way to contribute to solving this issue and give them light.

Introducing The World's Most Powerful iPhone Case
It's very simple: an affordable case that protects your phone and makes the world a better place. Every case purchased contributes directly to Nepal relief and provides a meal to someone in need of food and a solar light to someone without electricity.

We set our minimum project funding goal at $12,000 USD because this is what it will take to:

Cover our iPhone case & packaging production costs
Order the solar lights (one for every case sold) from Nokero
Transport the solar lights from the factory to Nepal
Cover duties & taxes on the lights upon arriving in Nepal

Pay for meals (one for every case sold) for people in Nepal



Cover the costs to ship your perks



What happens if we don’t reach our goal:We already have enough iPhone cases to fulfil the orders below our minimum fundraising goal. If we do not hit our goal, we will still order Nokero solar lights and provide meals (one of each for every case sold) to those in need. No matter what we raise, you will still receive your case, and a solar light and meal will still make their way to Nepal on your behalf.

For those of you without iPhones or not interested in a case, you still have the opportunity to send a solar light and meal to someone in need in Nepal.



The Nokero Solar Lights

These solar lights are incredible. In just one day of charging in the sun, the light lasts five hours at night. We've tested these lights and they are remarkably bright.

Many of us take light for granted, but at night, it provides safety from people attempting to do harm. It benefits education, allowing children to read and do their homework at night.

Without electricity, our lives simply stop when the sun goes down.

<h3>Here is the best RF 434 Mhz - 868 Mhz LoRa / LoRaWan Gateway for Raspberry-Pi <br/>
</h3>
<p>We design shields for Arduino and Raspberry-Pi since many years and we wanted to have something to connect short range RF 434 Mhz transceivers and long range RF 868 Mhz transceivers.</p>
<p>Raspberry-Pi is a great Linux prototyping connected board (now with Wifi and BLE on board) as a result we designed a shield for that.<br/></p>
<p>Long range LoRa physical 1st OSI modulation layer and LoRaWan application 2&amp;3 OSI layers use case are now super easy with Chistera-Pi shield.<br/></p>
<p>Chistera-pi allows to test many other modulations and protocols over RF transceivers (434 &amp; 868 Mhz) : FSK, GFSK, OOK, LoRa, etc.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>According to statistics, up to 25% of all traffic fatalities, for drivers under 25 years old, happen because of distracted driving. With today's technology, our children are always linked in. Cell Phones, iPods, and other devices are a constant distraction for young drivers. Smart Monitor offers parents a way to minimize this threat to our kids. Smart Monitor will allow parents to disable certain features of their child's device, while driving. Calls to the parent and emergency services will still be allowed. In addition, parents will be able to track the location of their child, using GPS monitoring.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $25,000 to fund this project. This will allow us to develop the app for multiple devices and platforms. Let's face it, you can't put a price on saving lives. For $3 a month, parents can register up to 3 devices for their child, and ensure that they can be found (GPS monitoring), and will not be able to text or call while driving. We feel that this is a very reasonable cost for peace of mind. If we can save one life, this project will be a success.</p>

Often times, we are met every morning with a list of tasks waiting to be accomplished. Why not make life easier? Here at Amiko Tech, we have made this our primary objective, and we are proud to announce that the answer is finally here.  </p><p></p>
<p>Amiko is inspired by the idea of a computer personal assistant, who could mold to your specific persona, and be available at all times. This assistant adapts to your daily life, and understands your specific needs. Amiko allows the user to multitask with ease, and accelerates your life by accomplishing tasks by voice command. Simply put, Amiko works hard so you don’t have to.  </p>
<p>Today, Amiko has become the point in which an astonishing array of microtechnology and powerful application programming conjoin. The device works in unison with Amiko APP that allows for the user to make a simple download that will make the phone or tablet device completely compatible with the Amiko headset. Fitness Tracking, GPS navigation, social network updates, and more all within the capabilities of one brilliant headset.  </p>
<p>When designing Amiko, we knew that sound quality was of utmost importance. We set on our course to create the perfect microphone and speaker in order to convey audio quality at its finest. Amiko’s ear-bone microphone will pick up on vibrations from the skull and thus deliver excellent sound quality. As for the receiving end of sound, we’ve equipped Amiko with a noise-isolating speaker that will deliver clear HD audio.  </p>
<p>Since our inception in early 2012, our team of talented engineers has strived to create a headset that can be suitable for the myriad needs of the 21st century. After an eventful two years, we are truly proud to announce that the future of wireless headset technology is finally here!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927882/files/20141013155836-Screen_Shot_2014-10-13_at_6.57.05_PM.png?1413241116"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>

The result proved to be a perfect blend of both, as we created minimalistic, yet effective visuals and a comfortable in-ear fit that will hold securely. 
<p>The outer shell of Amiko is a combination of durable, top-quality plastic, and soft silicone particularly used in the areas that make most contact with skin. The silicone ear bud tips are comfortable and block unwanted outside noise. The device's blue region will alert the user when the headset is off or on, has low battery, or is pairing with a device.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927896/files/20141013160117-Real_.png?1413241277"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">An interesting fact about our design process is that we chose to avoid any flat, stodgy surfaces. We knew that by creating a curved surface all throughout the device, Amiko could more closely resemble the beauty of the natural world around us; which happens to be full of curved surfaces! Apart from it's clear aesthetic appeal, this design also aids in providing the optimal comfort that we sought. </span></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>We chose 4 basic colors; Onyx Black, Phantom White, Azure, and Rose Pink (plus a 5th color that you will be able to vote on if stretch goal #1 is reached!). We know that colors can be the ultimate expression of your personality, so take your pick when you choose your reward! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927933/files/20141013161907-4_AMIKOS.png?1413242347"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>The entire design is intended to resemble a regular earphone piece (wireless, of course) rather than many of those large, bulky bluetooth headsets seen on the market today. This way, Amiko can be more discreet all the while maintaining a sharp and innovative design. </p><p><br/></p>

<p>
</p><p>  Amiko will connect to any smart device using the latest Bluetooth 4.0 LE. It can connect to up to 3 devices at once, and will be perfectly compatible with iOS and Android softwares (the latest iOS 8 and Android 4.0 or newer). Amiko APP offers advanced control over the headset device, allowing you to set specific voice commands, turn features on/off to extend battery life, control settings, and configure the entire Amiko voice control system. </p>
<p> APP is the perfect companion to Amiko, enabling it to reach its extended capabilities. With APP, you will be able to personalize Amiko 100% to your liking, ensuring that no two Amikos can ever be the same.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927959/files/20141013162917-Title_-_How_does_it_work_.png?1413242957"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Amiko can pair directly with any devices that support bluetooth; smart TV's, speakers, computers, and much more! Once paired, voice control functionality is set up on your smartphone or tablet, where you can establish commands for any compatible device. For example, changing the channel on a TV can become as simple as saying ""Amiko, next channel,"" practically rendering remote controls obsolete. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927960/files/20141013162946-How_it_works.png?1413242986"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>If Amiko is connected to several devices at once, be sure to establish a different command for each designated device, when commands can be mutually intelligible. For example, ""Amiko, turn speaker volume down,"" as opposed to ""Amiko, turn TV volume down."" Amiko's bluetooth connectivity has been tested with up to 5 devices, although for optimal functionality, a maximum of 3 is highly recommended.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927961/files/20141013163056-Title_-_Sercan_Guvenisik_.png?1413243056"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Often times, we are met every morning with a list of tasks waiting to be accomplished. Why not make life easier? Here at Amiko Tech, we have made this our primary objective, and we are proud to announce that the answer is finally here.  
Amiko is inspired by the idea of a computer personal assistant, who could mold to your specific persona, and be available at all times. This assistant adapts to your daily life, and understands your specific needs. Amiko allows the user to multitask with ease, and accelerates your life by accomplishing tasks by voice command. Simply put, Amiko works hard so you don’t have to.  
Today, Amiko has become the point in which an astonishing array of microtechnology and powerful application programming conjoin. The device works in unison with Amiko APP that allows for the user to make a simple download that will make the phone or tablet device completely compatible with the Amiko headset. Fitness Tracking, GPS navigation, social network updates, and more all within the capabilities of one brilliant headset.  
When designing Amiko, we knew that sound quality was of utmost importance. We set on our course to create the perfect microphone and speaker in order to convey audio quality at its finest. Amiko’s ear-bone microphone will pick up on vibrations from the skull and thus deliver excellent sound quality. As for the receiving end of sound, we’ve equipped Amiko with a noise-isolating speaker that will deliver clear HD audio.  
Since our inception in early 2012, our team of talented engineers has strived to create a headset that can be suitable for the myriad needs of the 21st century. After an eventful two years, we are truly proud to announce that the future of wireless headset technology is finally here!


When designing Amiko, it was our primary objective to deliver an appealing design without sacrificing one bit of comfort. The result proved to be a perfect blend of both, as we created minimalistic, yet effective visuals and a comfortable in-ear fit that will hold securely. 
The outer shell of Amiko is a combination of durable, top-quality plastic, and soft silicone particularly used in the areas that make most contact with skin. The silicone ear bud tips are comfortable and block unwanted outside noise. The device's blue region will alert the user when the headset is off or on, has low battery, or is pairing with a device.An interesting fact about our design process is that we chose to avoid any flat, stodgy surfaces. We knew that by creating a curved surface all throughout the device, Amiko could more closely resemble the beauty of the natural world around us; which happens to be full of curved surfaces! Apart from it's clear aesthetic appeal, this design also aids in providing the optimal comfort that we sought. 

We chose 4 basic colors; Onyx Black, Phantom White, Azure, and Rose Pink (plus a 5th color that you will be able to vote on if stretch goal #1 is reached!). We know that colors can be the ultimate expression of your personality, so take your pick when you choose your reward! 

The entire design is intended to resemble a regular earphone piece (wireless, of course) rather than many of those large, bulky bluetooth headsets seen on the market today. This way, Amiko can be more discreet all the while maintaining a sharp and innovative design. 






Introducing Amiko’s other half - Amiko App. Amiko App provides a fully personalized experience that will bring your headset to life, and allows you to customize your headset to suit your very specific needs. Program your very own smart alarm, view your workout results and fitness stats, pair devices, and choose from up to 5 preset Amiko voices. Track your device wherever it is, so you will never have to be worried about losing your headset! Once downloaded, thousands of possibilities unravel to bring to you the ultimate Amiko experience.

  Amiko will connect to any smart device using the latest Bluetooth 4.0 LE. It can connect to up to 3 devices at once, and will be perfectly compatible with iOS and Android softwares (the latest iOS 8 and Android 4.0 or newer). Amiko APP offers advanced control over the headset device, allowing you to set specific voice commands, turn features on/off to extend battery life, control settings, and configure the entire Amiko voice control system. 
 APP is the perfect companion to Amiko, enabling it to reach its extended capabilities. With APP, you will be able to personalize Amiko 100% to your liking, ensuring that no two Amikos can ever be the same.

Amiko can pair directly with any devices that support bluetooth; smart TV's, speakers, computers, and much more! Once paired, voice control functionality is set up on your smartphone or tablet, where you can establish commands for any compatible device. For example, changing the channel on a TV can become as simple as saying ""Amiko, next channel,"" practically rendering remote controls obsolete. 

If Amiko is connected to several devices at once, be sure to establish a different command for each designated device, when commands can be mutually intelligible. For example, ""Amiko, turn speaker volume down,"" as opposed to ""Amiko, turn TV volume down."" Amiko's bluetooth connectivity has been tested with up to 5 devices, although for optimal functionality, a maximum of 3 is highly recommended.

Sercan Güvenışık Short Biography:  
 Born March 1, 1980 in the city of Donauwörth, West Germany, Sercan began playing soccer at a very young age. He spent part of his youth career at the FC Bayern Munich youth academy. He spent much of his professional career playing a pivotal role as striker in both Germany and Turkey, before moving on to the San Jose Earthquakes and officially becoming the first Turkish soccer player in Major League Soccer.

Q: What is Amiko?
A: Amiko is a very original and futuristic device. Through my soccer I’ve been travelling a lot in the world and I really have never seen anything like that before. I’ve been testing it for weeks now, and it has really become a very important device in my life. 
Q: What is your favorite feature? 
A: My favourite feature - as a professional athlete I would have to say, the fitness tracker. I can measure my heart rate, and record my speed and distance that I have travelled. Besides that, I can listen to my favorite music while I’m working out. 
Q: How does it feel inside your ear? 
A: It is very comfortable, once I get used to it, I even forget it’s there! 
Q: Describe Amiko in one word: 
A: In one word - I would say revolutionary. We are Amiko Tech LLC. Our team is composed of highly skilled and professional individuals who have been fervent in our pursuit of Amiko. We are proud to say that our effort has yielded a brilliant result, and we are proud to say that we are Amiko Tech.

<p>We've taken the idea of a running belt and transformed the concept into something completely new and different; then expanded on the idea from a way to carry a phone while running to wallets and passport holders. </p>
<p>The One80 Pouch is the first stand alone pouch that can be added to a waistline (with or without a belt) with no need for a belt, pocket, magnets or velcro. This pouch makes it possible for you to carry those day to day necessities with ease. Each pouch lays discretely against your waist with little to no show. </p>
<p> Compare the old way to the newly reinvented One80 Pouch way!</p>

<p>Carrying your cell phone, cards or passport has never been so easy. </p>
<p>In developing the One80 Pouches we poured over reviews to figure out the good and bad of all comparable items. Zippers are the number one breaking point of running belt and fanny packs. Magnets are potentially dangerous to cell phones and velcro often loses its stick after time. So, we set out to find a way to develop the pouches without any of these to improve user experience and convenience. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575395169/itkrpvieyg8yabdea5jv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>No one likes sitting on a wallet. It's uncomfortable and annoying. </p>
<p>Minimal wallet are great. Better than a large traditional wallet. Yet the problem remains.  You have have to keep in a pocket. Do you deal with having it in a back pocket and the bother of sitting on it? Or keep it in a front pocket and contend with the front pocket bulge? </p>
<p>Dave, who has been testing testing the card holder wallet prototype said,</p>
<p><strong>""I went to using a minimal wallet a year ago. From there I started keeping it in my front pocket to avoid having to sit on it. That was better than a back pocket.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>But THIS wallet is a GAME CHANGER."" </strong></p>
<p>Fanny packs and running belts are great; but what if you don't want to carry that bulky thing? Or just want something more discrete? One80 Pouch is for you. Perfect to carry your phone on a run and inconspicuous enough to wear with almost anything out to a movies or dinner. Wearing leggings or jeans? With or without a belt? You can comfortably wear any of these with the One80 Pouches.   </p>

<p>In front, in back, on the side? Or maybe partially on the side or somewhere in between. Wear your pouch how you like.  </p>
<p>Even if you're not wearing it on you waist it's perfect for the inner pocket of your backpack or purse. Have you ever lost your wallet to bottom depths of a bag? Use your pouch to keep it attached inside the bag exactly where you need it. </p>

<p> Inconspicuously wear your One80 Pouch wherever life takes you. </p>
<p>True functionality happens so easily you don't have to think about it. Carrying items can be cumbersome and an obstruction. The One80 Pouch is truly functional.

</div></div>","The One80 Pouches use no magnet, no velcro and no zipper. They require no pocket or belt to provide you with an easy and safe solution for carrying your cards, phone or passport.  




We've taken the idea of a running belt and transformed the concept into something completely new and different; then expanded on the idea from a way to carry a phone while running to wallets and passport holders. 
The One80 Pouch is the first stand alone pouch that can be added to a waistline (with or without a belt) with no need for a belt, pocket, magnets or velcro. This pouch makes it possible for you to carry those day to day necessities with ease. Each pouch lays discretely against your waist with little to no show. 
 Compare the old way to the newly reinvented One80 Pouch way!


 

 
Carrying your cell phone, cards or passport has never been so easy. 
In developing the One80 Pouches we poured over reviews to figure out the good and bad of all comparable items. Zippers are the number one breaking point of running belt and fanny packs. Magnets are potentially dangerous to cell phones and velcro often loses its stick after time. So, we set out to find a way to develop the pouches without any of these to improve user experience and convenience. 

No one likes sitting on a wallet. It's uncomfortable and annoying. 
Minimal wallet are great. Better than a large traditional wallet. Yet the problem remains.  You have have to keep in a pocket. Do you deal with having it in a back pocket and the bother of sitting on it? Or keep it in a front pocket and contend with the front pocket bulge? 
Dave, who has been testing testing the card holder wallet prototype said,
""I went to using a minimal wallet a year ago. From there I started keeping it in my front pocket to avoid having to sit on it. That was better than a back pocket.  
But THIS wallet is a GAME CHANGER."" 
Fanny packs and running belts are great; but what if you don't want to carry that bulky thing? Or just want something more discrete? One80 Pouch is for you. Perfect to carry your phone on a run and inconspicuous enough to wear with almost anything out to a movies or dinner. Wearing leggings or jeans? With or without a belt? You can comfortably wear any of these with the One80 Pouches.   

In front, in back, on the side? Or maybe partially on the side or somewhere in between. Wear your pouch how you like.  
Even if you're not wearing it on you waist it's perfect for the inner pocket of your backpack or purse. Have you ever lost your wallet to bottom depths of a bag? Use your pouch to keep it attached inside the bag exactly where you need it. 

 

 Inconspicuously wear your One80 Pouch wherever life takes you. 
True functionality happens so easily you don't have to think about it. Carrying items can be cumbersome and an obstruction. The One80 Pouch is truly functional. You can wear it to the gym and it won't get in the way of your workout. Wear it running and it will disappear into your running experience. It's time to leave those bulky phone holders that demand continual adjustment behind. 
The easy attached clips make putting on your One80 Pouch super easy. The clips are smooth and super low profile so they won't bother or annoy you while wearing your pouch. The design was tested over and over to ensure easy attachment and removal, yet tight enough grip and hold securely.

Less is better, especially when talking about comfort. And that's exactly what your going to get with your One80 Pouch; comfort. So much less to worry about and be bothered by. 
No belt. No bulky over-sized  bag. No straps covered in velcro. No magnets to hold it on. No zipper to fuss with. Pure and simple comfort.
 

What makes these pouches so different from every other wallet, phone or passport holder? The easy on easy off propriety clips. So simple, yet made with precision to ensure your pouch will easily slip on to a waistline or belt, will hold secure, and then can be removed easily.

</ul><p>If you like photography, you won’t miss the mobile photography.</p><p>Compared to shooting with DSLR or mirrorless cameras, shooting with mobiles can also achieve good results. Thanks to the improvement of hardware and software performance, live streaming and short video shooting with mobile phones are becoming more and more popular among photographers. However, the problem is that fixing the mobile phone before shooting in traditional ways can often be complicated, unhandy, not so stable and lack of protection.</p><p>At the end of 2016, some of our dear customers suggested that we should design a specific iPhone cage, on which they would be able to mount other accessories to achieve mobile shooting. During some non-commercial situations which cares less about the professional perspective, shooting with iPhone would be much easier than with some professional equipment because of its small size and light weight. Later, similar suggestions were put forward intermittently, and we realized this would be a revolutionary product. Before long, a dedicated design team was founded.</p><p>In September 2017, Iphone X was announced. Its outstanding performance in shooting ensured us this would be a great opportunity and we seized that.</p><p>After updating 4 versions, drawing over 100 sketch designs, trying dozens of structural methods and solving multiple processing difficulties, in April 2019, this newly designed Iphone X cage came out. It retains a 17mm threaded lens mount for 17mm-threaded lenses and an additional bayonet mount plate for lenses. It also retains a unique Tri-chuck bayonet on which can be used to mount a holder, cradle or other external devices with the same structure for mobile phone filmmaking, video photography, interview, live stream, vlogging and etc..</p><p><strong>Design Concept</strong><br/>Source of inspiration: Spider web<br/>Product implication: catch prey, instant focus<br/>We always put our users’ needs first during the whole design process. We optimize product design continuously based on different usage scenarios because we know any product that is disengaged from our users and their using habits would be a failure. On this basis, we strive to achieve our vision in the most simple way, whether from the structure, appearance, processing methods or users habits, to bring the best quality products to our users.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555483423/oowuifqsqn7bapyjnzub.jpg"" src=""""/></p></div>","Specially Designed Cage for iphone X/XS Full Access to Phone Holes Full access to buttons and interfaces, does not affect cellular or WIFI reception Protect the phone Made of aluminum alloy with an anodized finishBack Tri-Chuck bayonet mount Hidden lanyard hole Product Features:

If you like photography, you won’t miss the mobile photography.Compared to shooting with DSLR or mirrorless cameras, shooting with mobiles can also achieve good results. Thanks to the improvement of hardware and software performance, live streaming and short video shooting with mobile phones are becoming more and more popular among photographers. However, the problem is that fixing the mobile phone before shooting in traditional ways can often be complicated, unhandy, not so stable and lack of protection.At the end of 2016, some of our dear customers suggested that we should design a specific iPhone cage, on which they would be able to mount other accessories to achieve mobile shooting. During some non-commercial situations which cares less about the professional perspective, shooting with iPhone would be much easier than with some professional equipment because of its small size and light weight. Later, similar suggestions were put forward intermittently, and we realized this would be a revolutionary product. Before long, a dedicated design team was founded.In September 2017, Iphone X was announced. Its outstanding performance in shooting ensured us this would be a great opportunity and we seized that.After updating 4 versions, drawing over 100 sketch designs, trying dozens of structural methods and solving multiple processing difficulties, in April 2019, this newly designed Iphone X cage came out. It retains a 17mm threaded lens mount for 17mm-threaded lenses and an additional bayonet mount plate for lenses. It also retains a unique Tri-chuck bayonet on which can be used to mount a holder, cradle or other external devices with the same structure for mobile phone filmmaking, video photography, interview, live stream, vlogging and etc..Design ConceptSource of inspiration: Spider webProduct implication: catch prey, instant focusWe always put our users’ needs first during the whole design process. We optimize product design continuously based on different usage scenarios because we know any product that is disengaged from our users and their using habits would be a failure. On this basis, we strive to achieve our vision in the most simple way, whether from the structure, appearance, processing methods or users habits, to bring the best quality products to our users.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

What is MHQ and how does it work?</b></font></font></font></a></p>
<p lang=""en-GB""><font><font size=""4"">MHQ is an
advanced communication service designed to put phone calls back in
your control. Part of its job, and one of the aspects you will
certainly like, is that it stops marketing phone calls. The other
part of its job is to let you control who can contact you, when they
can contact you and how they can contact you. The net result of MHQ
and its features is that it will free up your time and minimise
disruptions in your personal life. MHQ stops you from receiving unwanted phone calls at unwanted times from
unwanted people. For examples on what MHQ can do please read the features and examples further below.</font></font></p>
<p lang=""en-GB""><font><font size=""4"">To do its
work MHQ uses a Cloud based platform to pre-process your
incoming phone calls before they are sent to your phone. This includes signal processing, audio processing and self learning
systems. We combined those aspects with what we have learnt in our 8 years of being in the communications business space to ensure that MHQ delivers as we have outlined here. Because of this, we are 100% confident that we can deliver MHQ.</font></font></p>
<p lang=""en-GB""><font><font size=""4"">Here is an image illustrating how MHQ does its work:</font></font></p>

<p lang=""en-GB""><font><font size=""4"">Please
note MHQ is a service with an associated monthly fee. See below for

<p lang=""en-GB""><font><font size=""4"">MHQ is the brain child of Enrico, founder of MondoTalk (that's me writing this by the way, odd to refer to myself in the third person but I guess it reads better). My educational background is in Computer Science, IT and Mathematics. Eight years ago I founded MondoTalk, a company offering voice services and specializing in associated software development.</font></font></p>
<p lang=""en-GB""><font><font size=""4"">So how did I come upon MHQ. Well I had been talking to friends and family about how annoyed I was with the amount of unwanted phone calls I was getting. Many people sympathized and were also fed up with the situation. So here is where the mother of invention, necessity, put my neurons to the test. I used my experience and what I had learnt at MondoTalk and not long after an early, early, pre, pre alpha system was created. The first thing I did was to put it to the test, and it worked, marketing calls had stopped! I left it running for a few months and my wife and I were over the moon that we no longer got marketing phone calls. Mind you it wasn't a very elegant solution but it worked! From there the design went through many iterations, improvements and feature additions over the period of several years. It wasn't until 2013 that I believed I had put together a design that not only stopped marketing phone calls but was also intelligent enough to control all your calls, while at the same time keeping it easy to use. I then held a meeting with the rest of the MondoTalk team to get feedback and see if MHQ had merit. Everybody loved it and additional great ideas were added. Soon after a project was kicked off. Now all that remains is to get funding for the aspects of the project that the MondoTalk team do not have experience in. We need to hire exceptional iOS and Android developers to ensure that the MHQ App user interface is as easy to use as possible. This brings me to where I am now, writing this in hope you believe in MHQ as much as we do. If you do, please show your support by buying our perks. Your funds will be used to get the iOS and Android developers we need.</font></font></p><p lang=""en-GB""><font><font size=""4""><br/></font></font></p>

FAQ
 


What is MHQ and how does it work?
MHQ is an
advanced communication service designed to put phone calls back in
your control. Part of its job, and one of the aspects you will
certainly like, is that it stops marketing phone calls. The other
part of its job is to let you control who can contact you, when they
can contact you and how they can contact you. The net result of MHQ
and its features is that it will free up your time and minimise
disruptions in your personal life. MHQ stops you from receiving unwanted phone calls at unwanted times from
unwanted people. For examples on what MHQ can do please read the features and examples further below.
To do its
work MHQ uses a Cloud based platform to pre-process your
incoming phone calls before they are sent to your phone. This includes signal processing, audio processing and self learning
systems. We combined those aspects with what we have learnt in our 8 years of being in the communications business space to ensure that MHQ delivers as we have outlined here. Because of this, we are 100% confident that we can deliver MHQ.
Here is an image illustrating how MHQ does its work:


Please
note MHQ is a service with an associated monthly fee. See below for
more details on the available packages. Some of our perks will
give you discounts on these plans.








Who is behind MHQ?
MHQ is the brain child of Enrico, founder of MondoTalk (that's me writing this by the way, odd to refer to myself in the third person but I guess it reads better). My educational background is in Computer Science, IT and Mathematics. Eight years ago I founded MondoTalk, a company offering voice services and specializing in associated software development.
So how did I come upon MHQ. Well I had been talking to friends and family about how annoyed I was with the amount of unwanted phone calls I was getting. Many people sympathized and were also fed up with the situation. So here is where the mother of invention, necessity, put my neurons to the test. I used my experience and what I had learnt at MondoTalk and not long after an early, early, pre, pre alpha system was created. The first thing I did was to put it to the test, and it worked, marketing calls had stopped! I left it running for a few months and my wife and I were over the moon that we no longer got marketing phone calls. Mind you it wasn't a very elegant solution but it worked! From there the design went through many iterations, improvements and feature additions over the period of several years. It wasn't until 2013 that I believed I had put together a design that not only stopped marketing phone calls but was also intelligent enough to control all your calls, while at the same time keeping it easy to use. I then held a meeting with the rest of the MondoTalk team to get feedback and see if MHQ had merit. Everybody loved it and additional great ideas were added. Soon after a project was kicked off. Now all that remains is to get funding for the aspects of the project that the MondoTalk team do not have experience in. We need to hire exceptional iOS and Android developers to ensure that the MHQ App user interface is as easy to use as possible. This brings me to where I am now, writing this in hope you believe in MHQ as much as we do. If you do, please show your support by buying our perks. Your funds will be used to get the iOS and Android developers we need.

MHQ history

The MHQ idea has

	onslaught of marketing calls and talking about this with friends who also were experiencing many unwanted calls.


Trials
	on the technology have been conducted since 2012.


Refined design was finished May 2013.

How funding will be used

Funding received will be used to employ exceptionally skilled iOS and Android resources. They will be required to convert our draft App design into an easy to use interface. Our aim is to make MHQ easy enough for anyone to be able to control and customize. We believe first time users will spend less than 10 minutes getting MHQ up and running.
If we meet our goal of $10,000, then we will release some great stretch goals. These will add to the features and openness of MHQ.

<p>But on the other hand, I was against spending hundreds of dollars on those accessories and buying a backpack to carry all those accessories with me every day. </p>

</div></div>","1. OVERVIEW


IRENE is a project designed by Narek Bavikyan, better known as Naneau, and developed in collaboration with an industrial designer Vadim Kibardin. Both designers are based in Prague, Czech Republic. 


IRENE is a versatile and multi-functional system for all types of Smartphones, Tablets, Portable Cameras and Car GPS Navigators, regardless of the model or manufacturer. 
IRENE is an attempt to create a certain ideological analog of a Swiss knife in the field of accessories for modern devices.




2. THE STORY 
Narek himself explains the history of the project: ""One day I was in a giant electronics store and I was struck by an infinite number of different accessories for various smartphones, tablets, portable cameras and car navigators. 
On the one hand, I knew that as an active user of these devices, these accessories provide some necessary and useful functions. 
But on the other hand, I was against spending hundreds of dollars on those accessories and buying a backpack to carry all those accessories with me every day. 
And most of all, as a person keen on sustainable design, I was frustrated with 



the irresponsible wastefulness of resources; 


momentary and short life cycle combined with a pursuit of fashion and current models of gadgets; 


crudity of design, engineering solutions and neglection of convenience; 


and most of all - the indifference to the environment that was brought with the production of those accessories. 


A few weeks later after the analysis of the existing accessories, their functions and operating scenarios, I met with Vadim in a cafe, where we shared some thoughts. We began to discuss the idea and made the first sketches there. 


So that's how the project IRENE begun, based on the ten principles for good design by Dietem Rams, to whom we would like to express our deepest respect and love. ""

3. HIGHLIGHTS 
The market analysis of existing accessories identified some key functional groups for accessories and the benefits that IRENE has combined. 



A Handle/Holder for a Smartphone, Tablet, E-reader etc; 


A Table Stand for a Smartphone, Tablet, E-reader etc, that has two viewing modes and two input modes (portrait or landscape orientation); 


A Monopod for Smartphone, Tablet, Portable Cameras with 1/4 inch Hot Shoe Ball-Head Mount; 


Versatile Car GPS Navigator, Smartphone, Tablet  Mount; 


Security lock for Smartphone, Tablet and any other devices;


Two 1/4 inch universal screws for additional bases and extensions that enhance the functional of IRENE, so you can add functionality more and more; __________________________________________________

Elegant aesthetic design, crafted to the very last detail; Durable construction and long-lasting design allows IRENE to become an accessory that gets better over the years and becomes a think of true value and emotional attraction for its owner;

Innovative in its versatility and flexibility, IRENE allows you to use it for almost all types of Smartphones, Tablets, Portable Cameras, Car Navigators, regardless of the model or manufacturer. And this applies not only to those devices that are manufactured today, but also to those that gonna appear tomorrow. That's why the customer will not need to buy a new IRENE, if he wishes to change the gadget, as in the case with all the majority of Handles/Holders, Cases, Table Stands and many other accessories, designed for specific models of different manufacturers; 

Ease of use, as well as compact size and weight; 
Environmentally friendly – even the packaging.



  
4. DESIGN 

IRENE has an elegant aesthetic design with all its clean lines, lean on the material, functionality and meticulous attention to color and texture of the surface, that wants to be touched.

Phone Cases…

Who We Are
We 
are Effective Products. Our motto is “Changing the world, one product at a 
time”. We’re product developers and brand designers looking to make the best

products specifically designed to be:

quality, luxury products. 

Cost

Be 
eco-friendly and made from environmentally safe materials. 
This 
is when we came up with the idea for the “Greenline” series. The Greenline 
series is a line of premium, cool, earth friendly products that are great for 
you and awesome for the environment.

with high end quality design, superior manufacturing and premium eco friendly

<h2>Tom Kowalick's Automotive Black Box Security Mission</h2>
I'm a retired professor after 30 years with an intense passion towards enhancing vehicle and highway safety while safeguarding civil liberties, consumer protection and privacy. I am president of AIRMIKA, Inc., located in the Sandhills region of North Carolina at Southern Pines, and the manufacturer of a simple to use automotive aftermarket product for vehicle owners - The AUTOcyb (tm) Automotive Cyber Security Lock. 
<p>Since 1997, I helped create automotive black technology in light vehicles (cars and trucks) with high level national and international experience in Event Data Recorder (EDR) standardization, legislation and regulation. I am widely recognized as a true expert regarding EDRs and have testified to the U.S. Senate, National Academies of Sciences, Government Accounting Office (GAO)  and many other places.  I'm author of seven (7) books) on the topic including FATAL EXIT: The Automotive Black Box Debate.  </p>
<p>This technology has the potential of reducing injuries and deaths but also has the capability of subjecting vehicle owners and motorists to unnecessary problems if the data is not accurate and secured. </p>
<p><strong>My mission is to assure fair usage of automotive black box technologies</strong>.</p>
<p>Recently Congress and federal regulators failed to provide essential consumer protection.  I took the next steps and created and manufactured a product to do just that.  It is simple to install and remove and protects the security, integrity and authenticity of the data.  You hold the key, not automakers, law enforcement or insurance companies. If others want to access your crash data they will have to seek your permission or use legal means to do so.  Basically, this device protects your interests. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I believe this will be a high demand disruptive technology product that will put data control back in the hands of the vehicle owner.  Businesswise, I have everything in place to take my company to the next level except funding to produce more units and marketing. </p>
<p>Presently 4000 units are ready to ship. I offer each person who donates $33.00 or more to this important project one (1) AUTOcyb (tm) - Automotive Cyber Security Lock shipped anywhere nationwide USA.  The product does not currently ship outside the U.S.</p>
<p>I am also working on enhancing the product line with Near Field Communications (NFC) technology to create an Internet of Things cell app.</p>
<p>Bottom Line:  This project is all about your driving protection - something everyone needs.  Please share this important useful information with others.  </p>

<h1><strong><em><br/>POWER OF ANDROID</em></strong></h1>
<p>Androidly runs our in-house developed, customized, full implementation of Android 2.2 OS, which makes it a smartwatch from the next generation. Androidly has access to over 500,000 applications on Google Play Store, most of which are free! So it remains infinitely customizable and adaptable as you grow, and as the Android ecosystem grows.<br/><br/></p>
<h1><strong><em>THE DESIGN</em></strong></h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/699/039/22b687b08f581e99079e55c3c2f74645_large.jpg?1372163706"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
<p>Androidly is a watch with an Android phone. It has a 2"" display and 2 buttons each on both the sides. The 2 buttons on the left are for controlling the volume and on the right side, the top button is for Menu and the bottom button is the Back button and doubles up as the power button. The SIM and the MicroSD card go underneath the battery.</p>
<p>It looks and feels just like a regular wrist watch, until you turn it on! Once it’s on, it looks quite unlike anything else you have ever seen. It’s fascinating to see and do on your wrist, what one could only do on larger and cumbersome devices until now. It’s an experience which was just not available before Androidly.</p>

<h1><strong><em><br/>EASE OF USE</em></strong></h1>
<p>Imagine if we combined a phone, camera, GPS, and an array of sensors into a smart device and miniaturized this device to the size of a conventional wristwatch with full Android running on top. This opens up a fascinating world of possible applications and usage scenarios. One would never need to pick any other device up, as the watch will always be strapped onto the wrist and available for use anytime, anywhere. The smartwatch integrates as an artificial limb of the users, providing all the benefits of a fully connected smart device, at all times!</p>

<p><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> Electric automobile charging stations need re-charge times similar to gas refueling, using off the shelf batteries. Our 12 minute time is close while the state of the art is 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> Among industrial vehicles, 95% of forklift trucks are forced to swap 1 ton batteries between shifts as fast charging alternatives require about 3.5 hours but regularly overheat and damage the batteries, releasing toxic fumes. We eliminate these problems and enable up to 75% savings for industrial rapid charging and double the revenue for automotive charging stations.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> Owners of devices such as cell phones, laptops, and power tools are often stranded waiting several hours to recharge. Our 12 minute recharge can solve that problem from a 110 volt outlet.</p>

CHARGETEK FACTORY
     
We seek your help in providing our patented ultra-fast battery charger technology to charger manufacturers. Those manufacturers will then provide to you products that recharge your ordinary off the shelf batteries in minutes without overheating: batteries used in your environmentally friendly electric cars or cell phones, cameras, power tools, toys, model cars and airplanes, and other consumer electronics. Dramatically faster charging will even be available for forklift trucks and other industrial electric vehicles. For your help, we are providing the perks in the list on the right.
Exciting New Development! Much earlier than expected, our manufacturing partner, Chargetek, Inc. (http://www.chargetek.com) will work with us to develop a programmable microcontroller chip that will be available to charger manufacturers before the end of the year. We expect the first prototype chips to be finished this summer. At that time, charger manufacturers will have the opportunity contract with us for microcontroller chips or for our charging algorithm to be installed on their own chips.
Therefore, rather than receiving chargers from our company or Chargetek, Indiegogo campaign contributors who want fast chargers will be added to the top of the list to receive them from a manufacturer that will use our technology to make fast chargers.
Our company, Potential Difference, Inc. has an exclusive license from the Georgia Institute of Technology for two rapid battery charging patents to charge lithium ion batteries in minutes without overheating: 70% state of charge in 10 minutes, 80% in 12 minutes, and 100% in 16 minutes. With more tweaking, we expect to even further reduce the charge time. See more test details near the end of this page.
Our success with this campaign can also affect the environment as we have successfully tested it on the lead acid battery chemistry used for electric vehicles and solar and wind power battery backup.

We will be donating 20% of our proceeds on this project to the French Red Cross. A copy of our donation receipt will be emailed to you. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Looking for new cases for your new iPad Pro? Look No further! Since 2006 SwitchEasy have been working on new ways to protect your electronic devices. With the newly announce iPad Pro we tend to believe early adopters such as you would want to get the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil. With that in mind, our team invented a brand new product which will greatly compliment your user experience with your new gear.Introducing CoverBuddy, the best case which offers you the best protection experience for your iPad Pro.CoverBuddy is unlike any case in the market which consists of a simple flat back. It compliments Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil seamlessly and offers an all-in-one convenience which no other cases will have in the market. CoverBuddy is also the world's first case for iPad Pro which offers interchangeable parts for multiple user scenarios. Ultra Slim form FactorCoverBuddy is designed for users who doesn't want to carry bulk but wants full protection. Made with super strong Polycarbonate at 1.5mm thickness, it's strong enough to protect, yet thin enough to get unnoticed!
Textured Finishing for great gripCoverBuddies are designed with a non-slip textured surface. This is to ensure that every time you hold your iPad, you will have good grip to it. As a bonus, the pencil holder (when attached with Apple Pencil) is a great handle for you to hold on to your large iPad.


Best Buddies with Smart Keyboard
CoverBuddy is designed with special cut-out area to seamlessly fit your Smart Keyboard. It's also compatible with Apple's Smart Cover. 

Never lose your Apple Pencil or Cap!CoverBuddy offers the world's first patent pending interchangeable FULL BODY Apple Pencil holder. The design is minimalistic and smart, and its created to blend in with your iPad Pro. Unlike a pencil loop or a stand, our pencil holder covers the whole lot including the easily removed pencil cap. Furthermore, operation of our pencil holder is super easy! You can slide your pencil in either way into the holder and it magically stays put in the cavity. To release the pencil, simply push the pencil through the middle opening of the holder and gently slide left or right. As a bonus, our pencil holder works equally well when detached, offering 360 degree protection for your Apple Pencil.  Sketch Board ModeWith the announcement of iPad Pro, we've figured that there is one user mode that's missing. We call it the ""Sketch Board"" mode. A small elevated angle is introduced when our pencil holder is attached to CoverBuddy. The result is an ergonomically perfect elevation for drawing with Apple Pencil or using the virtual keyboard. Now you can sketch with ease!Pencil charging with easeSometimes your Apple Pencil may be running out of juice, but a 15 second charge can power it for 30 minutes. CoverBuddy has special cut-out area designed to let your Apple Pencil charge with ease.Two for OneDidn't want to bring your Apple Pencil out today? No problem, our Apple Pencil holder can be easily detached and be replaced with our included faceplate. It can also be used independently to protect your pencil and cap. With our faceplate attachment, our case will be flat as a book and your iPad Pro can be on its way!

After wearing it for a while I wondered where to put it.  I knew I could just put it in my pocket, but I wondered why there wasn't a way to just attach it to my phone for easy storage.  After doing some research I was surprised to find that nothing like this existed!  After creating a very primitive prototype in my head I wondered if this would really be a good idea.</p><p>Here is an image of the very first physical drawing that I produced regarding this invention.</p><div>
<p></p>
<p>After getting everything down on paper I tried my best to create a prototype and I came up with a successful ""bare bones"" version (as seen in the video) that worked surprisingly well!  I took it on a trip with me to Georgia and I was able to use it very easily all the time.  It stayed safely attached to my phone while it was in my pocket and everything.</p>
<h1>How this also can be used</h1>
<p><b>You can also have multiple copies of my product to have one in your car for permanent storage for when your driving!</b> So you can easily move it between your phone and your storage hook inside your car!  Or even on your Desk at work!  You can use this product multiple times and can never have too many!</p>
<h1>What my goals are</h1>
<p>We currently have Patents and everything regarding the invention. We are wanting to be able to get a 3D render created for mass production. We are also wanting to be able to ""innovate"" the concept and add the ""Spring Action"" motion so its not an ""open hook"" it is a type of ""Circle Spring Hook"" or some people call it a ""Circle Carabiner"" which we displayed in the Concept image in the video.</p>
<p>We also want to be able to customize it so it doesn't look so ""plain"" if people want to have something more personalized etc.  We want people to be able to put family photos and friendly photos on their customized version of our product.  We also want them to have preset design options as well such our KickStarter donator versions.</p>
<p>Soon as we are able to get the funding we are excited to get moving on the product as soon as possible!  We fill this will help a ton of people not only preventing them from losing their current Bluetooth's and buying more, but also stay away from ""johnny law"" and those expensive Tickets for breaking the law in their states.</p>
<h1>My Production Plan</h1>
<p>I am wanting to start production as soon as funding is made available.  My plans are to get a full 3D Render created to submit off to a project production company here in Indiana to start producing the product.  I currently plan on getting my wife involved in helping me get production and shipping organized and developed.  We plan on doing web sales at first to our Kickstarter backers before pushing to get the product to be placed on shelves.  </p>
<p>All of the customization imaging that we are offering to our Kickstarter backers will be done manually by myself and my wife.  We want to make sure that your product is fully personalized.  We are expecting to have all our initial shipments to our Kickstarter backers shipped out within 3-4 months after getting fully funded.  We have this expectation because we already have the production company selected and ready to go we just need funding.  I appreciate all the feedback and look forward to the generous donations!</p>
</div><p></p><h2>Risks and challenges</h2><p>As with any Product Design the Risk is getting people to want to use the product. We feel that this is a strong product and people will buy it since it will be very cheap and efficient and won't break easily.</p><p>Another main risk is that our prototype is very simple compared to our goal. However the overall unit price for the new design is extremely low and isn't a game changer.</p><p>Some unique challenges we might face is getting the adhesive company and Circle Carabiner (Circle Spring Hook) designs that are versions we are wanting to incorporate into our final design. However, we do have plan B's and C's to use a more standardized look and other options to use for the adhesive potion. These other plans would be a little bit more expensive to create on a per-unite basis, but nothing significant just a small difference of around .40 cents per unit.</p><p>This would be temporary until the original company's we are in talks with decide to get fully on board when they see the potential of the product, then we are confident they will change their mind.</p><p></p></div>","Who I amMy name is Donald (I go by my middle name Matt) and I'm a 28 year old senior software/web engineer.  I have a wife and a beautiful 2 year old daughter.  I been writing software and creating websites for over 12 years back since Aol 2.5 days.  I currently own my own business which is really successful (surefiretaxes.com) and have developed it into a very profitable company.  I'm all about simplifying idea's and concepts to make life easier for the common person.How I came up with the ideaThis device came to mind when I bought my first Bluetooth Piece.

<p>The ASAP Dash not only works with all Iphone and Android devices, it is also<b> compatible with all USB devices</b>. Most phone chargers or power banks are only capable of outputting 2.1 Amps. We're already preparing for the future phones that accept a larger input, the ASAP Dash comes with a 2.4 Amp output. This makes it compatible with all iPad's and tablets.</p>
<p>The high output also means your iPhone will charge 2x faster than your standard wall charger (1 Amp).</p>
<p>You can also charge your iPad at the max speed of 2.4 Amp vs most wall chargers and power banks which only charge at 2.1 Amps.</p>

<p>What makes ASAP Dash charge up so fast is the patented protection circuit board (PCB) that has been engineered with both smaller and fewer parts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452144637/yjqlrq8hvtbrp4bkdj5x.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our unique PCB (pictured above) is able to accept higher than standard wattage (60W) with a much higher energy conversion speed that results in a quicker charge despite a lower wattage input than competitors.</p>
<p>The result of a higher energy conversion speed is a <b>much</b> <b>smaller adapter vs other fast charger brands, 40%+ lighter</b>. With an adapter that's only 150g, that's light enough to fit in most pockets or bags for all your adventures.</p>

<p>The idea of ASAP Dash first came when founder Vinson Leow, a frequent world traveller, decided he could no longer cope with always being low on phone battery especially at the most inconvenient times such as using the GPS or catching an Uber. This lead to the Chargeasap brand being born in 2016. Today's solution of portable phone chargers solved this, however presented a new problem: they either take 2 - 4 hrs to charge but hold too little capacity or hold enough capacity but take 6 - 8 hrs to charge. The solution is a charger that can charge most smartphones 100%, fits into any pocket and charges in 15 - 18 minutes . With over 10,000 hrs of research and development into cutting edge battery and protection circuit board technology we've created our revolutionary surge charging technology.</p>

<p>We're a team of designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs across Australia and United States who've worked together the last 2 years to bring this vision to life.</p>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">With the latest ground breaking technology, cutting edge design and experienced suppliers with 15+ years in the electronics industry, we ensure safety, quality and portability.</span></p>
<p>We wanted to share ASAP Dash with the Indiegogo community here first because of the strong community of creatives, innovators and early adopters. With your help not only will you help kickstart the next generation of batteries and change the world's expectations of charging speeds, you'll bring us one step closer to furthering future applications of this technology.

<details><summary>Why would I buy ASAP Dash over any other charger?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">If you don't like waiting for your phone to charge, then this is for you. Best yet, not only are we the fastest portable charger on the market, we are the only pocket-sized fast charger above 4,000mAh capacity</p></details><details><summary>When is ASAP Dash expected to ship?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">ASAP Dash is scheduled to ship June 2016.</p></details><details><summary>How will my order be shipped?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">We will be shipping with the most suitable premium courier and that will vary between countries. All shipments will have tracking which will be emailed to you once the delivery has been shipped.</p></details><details><summary>Which countries do you ship to?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">We ship to all countries excluding the following which have been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria &amp; Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any these countries we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more, however we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.</p></details><details><summary>Will I need to pay any VAT or import tax?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">We will be shipping from Australia, Unites States or United Kingdom. Hence for countries that accept shipments from these countries VAT or tax free there are no additional duties or taxes.</p></details><h4 style=""text-align: center;font-weight: normal;color: #00abbe;"">FEATURES</h4>
<details><summary>Will the ASAP Dash charge my iPhone in 5 minutes?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">No, there are two steps involved with using portable phone chargers to charge your iPhone on-the-go. <br/>Step 1: Charge the portable charger <br/>Step 2: Charge the iPhone. <br/>1) The ASAP Dash charges up incredibly fast. In just 5 minutes, the ASAP Dash stores enough power to charge an iPhone 5 from 0 - 100%. <br/>2) This step is where you use the ASAP Dash to charge your iPhone. A complete iPhone recharge from the ASAP Dash usually takes 60 - 90 min. The ASAP Dash has a built-in smart chip which detects devices and charge them at their maximum rate (3.1A / 5V).</p></details><details><summary>Can I charge ASAP Dash whilst charging my phone?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">ASAP Dash does not offer simultaneous charging as it would increase excess heat with the surge charging technology. Instead, just wait 15 minutes and you'll be able to charge on-the-go.</p></details><details><summary>What is the battery life of the ASAP Dash?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Under ideal circumstances the ASAP Dash will charge and discharge over 1200 times which is 4x the average 300 cycles most charges provide today.</p></details><details><summary>How long will the ASAP Dash stay charged?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Lithium polymer batteries have internal self-discharge that is dependent on external environmental conditions such as heat. Stored at room temperature, the ASAP Dash will loss 5% of its charge after 1 week and 30% every month. It is recommended to charge ASAP Dash for at least 5 minutes if left unused for more than 1 week.</p></details><details><summary>Does the ASAP Dash come with international warranty?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Yes, all ASAP Dash orders will come with an international 365 day warranty.</p></details><details><summary>Does ASAP Dash come with a big wall charger?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Heck no, unlike other fast charger brands where their technology has restricted users to bulky wall charger units making them impractical for travel, ASAP Dash's charger unit is a mere 150g (5.3oz), light enough for you to carry on any trip.</p></details><details><summary>How many times can ASAP Dash full charge my smart phone?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">This depends on the battery capacity of your smart phone. ASAP Dash has a capacity of 5000 mAh, which is 2 - 3 times the capacity of most smart phones today. However please note that this is not a direct comparison, for a detailed understanding please <a href=""http://www.cablechick.com.au/blog/what-are-power-banks-and-how-do-they-work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">visit this link.</a></p></details><details><summary>Can ASAP Dash damage my phone over long term use?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">No. Your phone will act as if it is connected to a standard wall power outlet via your conventional charger and will not affect your existing phone warranty.</p></details><details><summary>Have you considered adding Qualcomm Quick Charge (QC2.0 or 3.0) technology?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">We've looked into this and there are 2 reasons we haven't included it: Firstly adding the QC technology will make the ASAP Dash at least 25% larger and we did not want to sacrifice the lightness or portability. Secondly the QC technology would increase the price of the ASAP Dash and we're aiming to keep it as the best value fast charger on the market.</p></details><details><summary>How important is Qualcomm Quick Charge compatibility in considering buying my power bank?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">If you are buying a new phone in 2016 the answer is NONE AT ALL. This is because all new phones released from 2016 onwards will use a USB Type-C connector instead of Lightning or Android connector which is FASTER than QC technology and hence will no longer be needed.</p></details><details><summary>How important is the output current (Amps)?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">VERY important- many competitors will mislead you and give you their total output from more than 1 connector. This is very false as 3 x 1 Amps outputs means 3 phones can only charge at a max of 1 Amp at a time. Our connector charges at 3.1 Amps (over 3 times faster) which is required for iPads, tablets and all current and future phones which will use a USB Type-C connector. Look out for only 3.1 Amps output chargers and power banks if you are buying a phone from 2016 onwards as it will otherwise not charge your phone at its max speed.</p></details><h4 style=""text-align: center;font-weight: normal;color: #00abbe;"">COMPATIBILITY</h4>
<details><summary>Which USB devices are compatible with the ASAP Dash?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">The ASAP Dash has the ability to charge all USB devices including: iPhones, Android phones, Windows phones, iPads, Android Tablets, GoPros, Bluetooth headphones and the list goes on. We are also USB Type-C compatible.</p></details><details><summary>Does the dual USB cable charge all USB devices?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">The dual micro USB and lightning cable will charge all USB devices that are compatible with those 2 inputs. If your USB device does not accept these inputs you will simply need to use your existing cable to plug from the ASAP Dash into your USB device.</p></details><details><summary>Can I charge the ASAP Dash from a regular USB wall or car USB outlet?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">You can charge the ASAP Dash in the following ways: <br/>(1) To 100% in 15 minutes via the fast wall charger or fast car charger that comes with the ASAP DASH<br/>(2) At regular speed using your current USB wall charger or car USB outlet </p></details><details><summary>Will the voltage be compatible with my country?</summary><p style=""padding-left:18px;"">Our wall charger is compatible with all voltages internationally. You will have the option to choose 1 of 4 international standard wall plugs (Type A, F, G, I.) Please refer to our ""Wall Socket Options"" section to find your country. If your country does not support either type, you may use a travel adapter.</p></details>

 Our mission is to finally fix this problem by creating a portable charger that charges insanely fast from a wall socket. How fast? ASAP Dash charges up to 16x faster than standard power banks in the market today.Our patented fast charge technology puts us miles ahead of the nearest competition both in charge speed and size of the charger allowing you always be on-the-go. It's the first charger in the world to give you a whole weekend of charge to carry around that's pocket sized! 











If you're familiar with crowdfunding websites you've seen many fast chargers power banks launching in the past year, here's a comparison chart showing ASAP Dash's stand out features.  
For all all customer service inquiries please email hello@chargeasap.com and the Customer Happiness Team will respond within 48 business hours
 


All competitor information has been collected from the latest publicly available campaign or website pages and is correct as of the date of campaign launch. 

 

ASAP (an acronym/abbreviation/slang) means ""As Soon As Possible"", which is how fast you can now be on the go with your smartphone.
Unlike other rapid charge chargers which have a tiny capacity (under 2,000 mAh), ASAP Dash stores an incredible 5,000mAh keeping your phone going for more than 48 hrs.
PLEASE NOTE: ASAP Dash charges in 15 minutes, not your phone. 
Check out how much power ASAP Dash can store in as little as 5 minutes:

""mAh"" refers to the battery capacity of your phone. Samsung phones have a larger capacity than iPhone and hence will typically last longer.
Most portable chargers take FOREVER to charge, we've all been there waiting up to 10 hours to power them up, keeping you stuck to the wall and defeats the purpose of portable power.
 


ASAP Dash features an amazingly slim and sleek anodized aluminum shell. We've really stripped down the charger and removed the unnecessary features to give you one of the thinnest high capacity chargers you've ever seen. Don't be fooled by the sleek profile as it does pack a punch of battery power!


The ASAP Dash not only works with all Iphone and Android devices, it is also compatible with all USB devices. Most phone chargers or power banks are only capable of outputting 2.1 Amps. We're already preparing for the future phones that accept a larger input, the ASAP Dash comes with a 2.4 Amp output. This makes it compatible with all iPad's and tablets.
The high output also means your iPhone will charge 2x faster than your standard wall charger (1 Amp).
You can also charge your iPad at the max speed of 2.4 Amp vs most wall chargers and power banks which only charge at 2.1 Amps.
PLEASE NOTE: ASAP Dash charges in 15 minutes, not your phone. 



 

Have you ever used an old phone or laptop after charging it to 100% and it seems to run out FAST? It's because you've likely exceeded the battery life cycle.
Standard batteries today typically offer 100 - 300 cycles whilst premium battery packs can last up to 500 cycles (based on ideal conditions). Typically charging a battery at a higher than recommended wattage will result in it heating up (even exploding) or reducing its life cycle. 

By using advanced battery technology, ASAP Dash solves this conventional problem with fast charge speeds and a 1,200 battery life cycle, that's 4x the industry standard.
This means most batteries when used 7 days a week will only last 1 year whilst ASAP Dash will last 3+ years even when used 7 days a week. Finally a reliable charger that lasts!



**ROSE GOLD EDITION NOW AVAILABLE**


 


What makes ASAP Dash charge up so fast is the patented protection circuit board (PCB) that has been engineered with both smaller and fewer parts.

Our unique PCB (pictured above) is able to accept higher than standard wattage (60W) with a much higher energy conversion speed that results in a quicker charge despite a lower wattage input than competitors.
The result of a higher energy conversion speed is a much smaller adapter vs other fast charger brands, 40%+ lighter. With an adapter that's only 150g, that's light enough to fit in most pockets or bags for all your adventures.





ASAP Dash units are put through a rigorous series of tests to ensure we're able to secure our international certifications. Some are outlined below.


ASAP Dash units are placed inside a temperature chamber that mimics hot and cold weather conditions. They are put through extremes of -15°C to 60°C and tested after to still be in perfect working condition.

Chargers are repeatedly charged to 100% then drained to 0% to ensure the batteries are at perfect working capacity.
 

 
ASAP Dash comes with international drop test certification. This means ASAP Dash can be dropped from a height of 1 metre (3.28ft) onto any side of the unit onto a hard wooden surface repeatedly and will still be 100% functional.


We've gone the extra mile to ensure your ASAP Dash is a light as possible, so we're proud to be one of the first crowdfunding campaigns to offer our wall sockets in 4 different wall types, so you won't need to purchase a travel adaptor to use in your own country. You can choose from 1 of the 4 most popular international wall socket types below.

Type A: USA, Canada, Mexico & Japan
Type F: Europe & Russia, except for the UK & Ireland
Type G: United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus & Singapore
Type I: Australia, New Zealand, China & Argentina


The idea of ASAP Dash first came when founder Vinson Leow, a frequent world traveller, decided he could no longer cope with always being low on phone battery especially at the most inconvenient times such as using the GPS or catching an Uber. This lead to the Chargeasap brand being born in 2016. Today's solution of portable phone chargers solved this, however presented a new problem: they either take 2 - 4 hrs to charge but hold too little capacity or hold enough capacity but take 6 - 8 hrs to charge. The solution is a charger that can charge most smartphones 100%, fits into any pocket and charges in 15 - 18 minutes . With over 10,000 hrs of research and development into cutting edge battery and protection circuit board technology we've created our revolutionary surge charging technology.

We're a team of designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs across Australia and United States who've worked together the last 2 years to bring this vision to life.

With the latest ground breaking technology, cutting edge design and experienced suppliers with 15+ years in the electronics industry, we ensure safety, quality and portability.
We wanted to share ASAP Dash with the Indiegogo community here first because of the strong community of creatives, innovators and early adopters. With your help not only will you help kickstart the next generation of batteries and change the world's expectations of charging speeds, you'll bring us one step closer to furthering future applications of this technology. Imagine a world with unlimited battery power, living life unplugged and always on-the-go. Help us bring the fast charge battery revolution today!

CAMPAIGN
Why would I buy ASAP Dash over any other charger?If you don't like waiting for your phone to charge, then this is for you. Best yet, not only are we the fastest portable charger on the market, we are the only pocket-sized fast charger above 4,000mAh capacityWhen is ASAP Dash expected to ship?ASAP Dash is scheduled to ship June 2016.How will my order be shipped?We will be shipping with the most suitable premium courier and that will vary between countries. All shipments will have tracking which will be emailed to you once the delivery has been shipped.Which countries do you ship to?We ship to all countries excluding the following which have been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria & Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any these countries we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more, however we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.Will I need to pay any VAT or import tax?We will be shipping from Australia, Unites States or United Kingdom. Hence for countries that accept shipments from these countries VAT or tax free there are no additional duties or taxes.FEATURES
Will the ASAP Dash charge my iPhone in 5 minutes?No, there are two steps involved with using portable phone chargers to charge your iPhone on-the-go. Step 1: Charge the portable charger Step 2: Charge the iPhone. 1) The ASAP Dash charges up incredibly fast. In just 5 minutes, the ASAP Dash stores enough power to charge an iPhone 5 from 0 - 100%. 2) This step is where you use the ASAP Dash to charge your iPhone. A complete iPhone recharge from the ASAP Dash usually takes 60 - 90 min. The ASAP Dash has a built-in smart chip which detects devices and charge them at their maximum rate (3.1A / 5V).Can I charge ASAP Dash whilst charging my phone?ASAP Dash does not offer simultaneous charging as it would increase excess heat with the surge charging technology. Instead, just wait 15 minutes and you'll be able to charge on-the-go.What is the battery life of the ASAP Dash?Under ideal circumstances the ASAP Dash will charge and discharge over 1200 times which is 4x the average 300 cycles most charges provide today.How long will the ASAP Dash stay charged?Lithium polymer batteries have internal self-discharge that is dependent on external environmental conditions such as heat. Stored at room temperature, the ASAP Dash will loss 5% of its charge after 1 week and 30% every month. It is recommended to charge ASAP Dash for at least 5 minutes if left unused for more than 1 week.Does the ASAP Dash come with international warranty?Yes, all ASAP Dash orders will come with an international 365 day warranty.Does ASAP Dash come with a big wall charger?Heck no, unlike other fast charger brands where their technology has restricted users to bulky wall charger units making them impractical for travel, ASAP Dash's charger unit is a mere 150g (5.3oz), light enough for you to carry on any trip.How many times can ASAP Dash full charge my smart phone?This depends on the battery capacity of your smart phone. ASAP Dash has a capacity of 5000 mAh, which is 2 - 3 times the capacity of most smart phones today. However please note that this is not a direct comparison, for a detailed understanding please visit this link.Can ASAP Dash damage my phone over long term use?No. Your phone will act as if it is connected to a standard wall power outlet via your conventional charger and will not affect your existing phone warranty.Have you considered adding Qualcomm Quick Charge (QC2.0 or 3.0) technology?We've looked into this and there are 2 reasons we haven't included it: Firstly adding the QC technology will make the ASAP Dash at least 25% larger and we did not want to sacrifice the lightness or portability. Secondly the QC technology would increase the price of the ASAP Dash and we're aiming to keep it as the best value fast charger on the market.How important is Qualcomm Quick Charge compatibility in considering buying my power bank?If you are buying a new phone in 2016 the answer is NONE AT ALL. This is because all new phones released from 2016 onwards will use a USB Type-C connector instead of Lightning or Android connector which is FASTER than QC technology and hence will no longer be needed.How important is the output current (Amps)?VERY important- many competitors will mislead you and give you their total output from more than 1 connector. This is very false as 3 x 1 Amps outputs means 3 phones can only charge at a max of 1 Amp at a time. Our connector charges at 3.1 Amps (over 3 times faster) which is required for iPads, tablets and all current and future phones which will use a USB Type-C connector. Look out for only 3.1 Amps output chargers and power banks if you are buying a phone from 2016 onwards as it will otherwise not charge your phone at its max speed.COMPATIBILITY
Which USB devices are compatible with the ASAP Dash?The ASAP Dash has the ability to charge all USB devices including: iPhones, Android phones, Windows phones, iPads, Android Tablets, GoPros, Bluetooth headphones and the list goes on. We are also USB Type-C compatible.Does the dual USB cable charge all USB devices?The dual micro USB and lightning cable will charge all USB devices that are compatible with those 2 inputs. If your USB device does not accept these inputs you will simply need to use your existing cable to plug from the ASAP Dash into your USB device.Can I charge the ASAP Dash from a regular USB wall or car USB outlet?You can charge the ASAP Dash in the following ways: (1) To 100% in 15 minutes via the fast wall charger or fast car charger that comes with the ASAP DASH(2) At regular speed using your current USB wall charger or car USB outlet Will the voltage be compatible with my country?Our wall charger is compatible with all voltages internationally. You will have the option to choose 1 of 4 international standard wall plugs (Type A, F, G, I.) Please refer to our ""Wall Socket Options"" section to find your country. If your country does not support either type, you may use a travel adapter.

<p>Meet Wizician, the only MFi lightning adapter with built in DAC and AMP and featuring a Lightning input port so you can charge your phone while using your headphones.</p>
<p>Wizician includes a Digital-to-Analogue Converter and Amplifier that is small, light, battery free and connects to your iPhone in seconds via Lightning port and makes any headphones sound amazing with clearer, louder, richer-sounding music and superior bass.</p>
<p>We have selected our MFi certified manufacturer and have been granted a PPID for Wizician, which simply means a preliminary approval based on our prototype and using Apple genuine C68 and C37 lightning charging port, also called a pass-thru charging port.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TRUST AND SUPPORT. IT MEANS A LOT TO US! Small, stylish wearable device that fits in your pocket. Pull it out when your other devices need saving in any emergency. Jiffy uses the new technology ""Quick Charge 2.0"" This is the fastest technology out at the moment for charging devices.We are living in the time of technology that has been developing more and faster than ever. Technology has become essential in today’s world. Our lives have become closely linked to mobile electronic devices, because they give us freedom of communication.Jiffy helps your devices when they run out of juice.When the battery runs out devices and gadgets become useless pieces of plastic and metal. They become unusable.Jiffy is an eco-charger and using the new technology ""Quick Charge 2.0"" will assure your device a quick charge that truly offers freedom and unlimited independence when it comes to charging your mobile devices and gadgets.That’s it! You are completely independent of any power supply, electric network, or wall outlet.  Jiffy is an eco-charger that has a priceless advantage both in everyday life and especially when travelling and going on new adventures even to the ends of the world.THE IDEAL SITUATION- to maintain a last call, an emergency call when you are in a critical situation, to send a last text, or study a map with GPS in case you get lost and can’t find sources to charge your device nearby.TOTAL ENERGY INDEPENDENCE- charge devices and gadgets at any time, any place and without taking in to consideration the weather, or temperature outside.Imagine a scenario of being lost in the woods, in the desert, or in a jungle. Your phones battery will be assured only by Jiffy!PRIORITY- compared to other methods of charging gadgets, Jiffy doesn’t need gas balloons with chemical reactions as other chargers. You can use it at night, in the shade, in thick forests unlike solar chargers. Jiffy also doesn’t need wind, or water currents.IMPORTANT-No traditional electricity, no air pollution, and you don’t need to look for a power outlet. In this way you don’t need to worry about where you will charge your mobile phone, camera, Bluetooth headset, or any other devices that can be charged through USB.Charge while on any type of transportation: train, ship, bus, or even wagon. You can rest assured and camp as much as you want, do extreme mountain sports, go hiking, or rock climbing without worrying that your camera, or smart phone will be without battery and you will remain without communication.We all know how problematic it is to find an electrical power outlet when going on longer trips. Also we know situations when electricity shuts off at home because of powerful rain, wind, or other natural phenomena that cause damage to power grids. You will be able to access the internet, radio, or other news portals in times of danger and emergency.Thanks to the USB attachment with LED light, Jiffy can be used as a light source. It does not need batteries and can be used at any time when there are blackouts and electricity and light are most needed. It is perfect to have a Jiffy handy in your emergency kit.MULTI USB- the cable is perfect to charge any gadget at any time. Charge your devices and gadgets, or help a friend that needs help, but needs a different kind of cable.How does Jiffy work? Jiffy represents a USB charger that mechanically produces electricity without eliminating toxic substances into the atmosphere. Electricity production is carried out by a three phase asynchronous micro generator with very high productivity, which is driven by a complex mechanical watch. With a simple movement the mechanism is charged with kinetic energy which is transmitted to the micro generators. The charging module is 5V USB that charges all the devices that support the standard USB. The intensity of electric current is up to 2200 mA and this offers a faster charge, by using the new tehnology ""Quick Charge 2.0"".For the people that are less technical, Jiffy with the 2200mA can simultaneously charge 6 smart phones with 4” screens that are navigating the internet through Wi-Fi, or 4 smart phones that are navigating the internet through 3G. Technical info about the prototype:Behind the micro generator is mounted a controller that has the function of continuously recovering the current and 5V voltage stabilization. Also an electrolytic capacitor which has the function of a micro accumulator is connected in the scheme to remove the current fluctuations produced by mechanical processes under the influence of kinetic energy.Electrical schemeWe documented our work process and wanted to share with you the important steps. Also watch the first prototype we tested.Thanks for making it all the way down here to meet team Jiffy!What we intend to do after the campaign is finished?After the Indiegogo campaign is finished we will start work on Jiffy immediately because we know that time is the biggest enemy for a start up. We know that we will encounter obstacles along the way, but we are ready to face them and if everything goes as planned we will deliver Jiffy within the timeline that we estimated. We hope that Jiffy is just the first of many devices that we work on. For us this is hopefully going to be a successful campaign that will turn into a small business and generate enough income to give us the possibility to work on bigger projects. It would be great to work on other projects that will bring solutions to problems like reusable energy, eco friendly energy, global warming etc. These are the problems that bother us and we hope that with your help we will be able to start attending to them.TIMELINEPerks",17.0,2,"12 Campaigns

<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>Versions 1 &amp; 2</h3>
<p>The Jeligeo platform, was first developed in 2009, to serve as a geo-located database and smartphone application for  African-American History and Culture. The product was started to answer two main questions:<br/><br/><em>1. How does a businessperson, parent, or traveler learn more about what impact people of African descent have had in a city?</em><br/><br/><em>2. How do cultural institutions, libraries, tourism agencies and operators attract more visitors?</em><br/><br/>With the expanding ownership of smartphones amongst African-American, Latino, and other cultural/affinity groups, it was felt that new channels were now available to provide rich and interactive heritage and tourism content in the palm of consumer’s hands.<br/><br/>Version 1, known as the iHeritage Guide, was launched as a free iPhone application and was the first of it’s kind on the Apple iStore.  It was available for 19 months and had 6,000 downloads with no marketing spend.  Version 2 saw the development iBlackHeritage.tv, which took the main elements of the iHeritageGuide and brought it to the mobile web.  The new content database featured an ability to incorporate social media components such as YouTube videos, QR code technology, and rich text content on a geo-located database.</p>
<h3>Current: Version 3</h3>
<p>After soliciting feedback from users of the two versions, it was decided to embark on the development of Version 3 of the platform, reconfiguring both the content and platform.  More details below...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Team</strong></h3>
<p>The team behind Jeligeo has over 30 combined years in global technology and entrepreneurial ventures.  The founder, Samuel Suraphel, envisioned and designed Jeligeo along with co-founder James Harris.  Both have focused their career on developing technology that meets the intersection between emerging cultural, technological trends and business opportunities.  </p>
<p><br/>Legal assistance is provided by a leading Silicon Valley law firm and advisors include practitioners in the heritage, digital media, and tourism sectors.</p>
<h3>We'd like to extend the team to users like yourself!! </h3>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get </strong></h2>
<p>For the relaunch of Jeligeo, we will begin creating a library of curated guides that cover various affinity groups/interests which will be made available within and outside of the application via social media sites, Mp3 audio downloads, the mobile web and on iOS and Android platforms.  Additionally, users will be able interact with curated content via a check-in system similar to foursquare and also be able to submit and rate specific sites.</p>
<p>Our biggest hurdle is connecting with the huge number of city experts who would like to contribute the wealth of heritage found in their hometowns and working with them to organize and upload the information, media, and geolocation onto our platform.  Along with this effort, are the costs of outreach to various groups, such as parents and teachers, to assist them in finding strategic ways to integrate Jeligeo into learning experiences for their children.</p>
<p>The funds will be spent on 50% on tech, 25% content, and 25% outreach.  If we do not reach our target, the funds contributed will be spent on adding further content(i.e. heritage sites) onto the existing platform.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Curator</strong> level contributors will receive digital markers to thank them for their contribution on an existing site.  <strong>Ambassador</strong> level contributors can have a city included on the current Jeligeo African database, that currently is not listed, plus five entries that are designated as national heritage sites by a local historic preservation society.  <strong>Gobiz</strong> level contributors will be able to have one tablet donated(including Jeligeo app and content) to a school or library of their choice within the US and Canada.  </p>
<p><strong>Ras</strong> level contributors can be a part of launching additional affinity groups such as Women Heritage, Latino Heritage, etc...  Though not listed as perk, please feel free to touch base through our contact for further information on this option.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
</div>
<div>The team behind Jeligeo has consistently worked to bring forward our experience to help bridge the pain point found amongst those who seek to connect with their heritage...<strong>.knowing where it is.  </strong>Those who are not scholars or have the benefit of knowing one, are limited in information and time needed to connect and visit such sites. </div>

<p><b>Design Technologies</b></p>

The Web server sends out web pages in response to requests from browsers. A page request is generated when a client clicks a link on a web page in the browser.<br/><br/>2) HTTP - Hyper Text Transport Protocol is the communication protocol used to connect to servers on the World Wide Web. The primary function of HTTP is to establish a connection with a Web server and transmit HTML pages to the user's browser.<br/><br/>3) JDBC – Java Database Connectivity is an application program interface (API) specification for connecting programs written in Java to the data in popular databases. The application program interface lets you encode access request statements in structured query language (SQL) that are then passed to the program that manages the database. It returns the results through a similar interface.<br/><br/>4) XML - A programming language/specification developed by the W3C, for organizing and tagging elements of a document so that the document can be transmitted and interpreted between applications and organisations.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Design Methodology</b></p>
<p>For the application to be designed successfully, several stages of development may be required:<br/><br/>1) Initial Design - conceptualizing how the app may initially look<br/><br/>  • Figuring out and sketching what the screens may look like, describing how they will behave, etc.<br/><br/>  • Deciding what graphical design and art work will be necessary for the user interface.<br/><br/>  • Deciding what kind of back end server support the app will require.<br/><br/><br/>2) App Development – once the design is finalized, actual development on the application will begin.<br/><br/><br/>3) Testing – once the application is fully implemented, beta testing will begin. Generally, at this stage, end users will be selected to perform testing to discover any bugs and problems.<br/><br/><br/>4) Deployment – making the application available to the general public.<br/><br/><br/>5) Maintenance – users may encounter problems which may not have been detected during testing.

You bought a more expensive earphone set, only to be disappointed by marginal quality improvements. It turns out that the reason to this is down to the limited audio processing capabilities inside your phone. We at Zorloo are tired of the limitations of the current earphone capabilities. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Because of this, we designed the Aero Digital Earphones. Digital earphones are earphones that bypass the standard device audio processing unit, and recreate HiFi quality music directly through the earphone set itself via a built-in DAC (Digital to Analog Converter). Aero Digital Earphone eliminates the bottleneck that the standard processing method experiences and faithfully reproduces your music that comes out of your earphones and into your ears. With this built-in DAC and amplifier, they are not just earphones. It is a complete HiFi system. Join the revolution and free your music!</span></p>

<p>We, Andy Ho and J.W. Cha, founded Zorloo at Nov-2014. We both previously worked in the consumer electronics industry and decided to work on something new and more exciting. We love music and believe it would be great if we can create something affordable to improve the mobile audio experience.</p>
<p>We picked USB-Audio technology to bypass your phones internal audio circuitry which is also the bottleneck. Mobility, performance and usability are our priorities. Aero is something we have been targeting from day one. Our goal is to make the Aero experience pleasing to users, with a small size and no battery, yet outputs an amazing sound!</p>
<p>During this journey, we have launched 2 successful crowdfunding campaigns, <a href=""http://igg.me/at/digitalearphone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'Z:ero - World's First Digital Earphone'</a> and <a href=""http://igg.me/at/zuperdac"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'ZuperDAC - The Portable HiFi Music USB-DAC'</a>, both in 2015. These 2 products are already in production, have been delivered to our backers and are available at our <a href=""http://www.zorloo.com/shop/zorloo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online store</a> and <a href=""http://www.zorloo.com/shop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">different marketplaces</a> (see Z:ero and ZuperDAC reviews <a href=""http://www.zorloo.com/reviews"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>). We are not however stopping at this, but rather pushing further until we reach perfection.</p>
<p>Aero is our ultimate goal to deliver a fully tuned earphone with an unmatched price performance. We have been pouring all our resource and investment into Aero Digital Earphone. We are now almost there and need your support to make this happen.</p>

<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">1. Is Aero for Lightning version certified by Apple?</b><br/></p>
<p>Aero is undergoing MFi certification at Apple right now. Our manufacturing factory is MFi certified so we will start the production once the certification is completed.</p>
<p><b>2. Does Aero for Micro-USB version work with all Android phones?</b></p>
<p>Due to fragmentation of Android and the unmanageable amount of different models, we are not able to guarantee the compatibility for all Android phones. We have tested with the following phones and they all work without any problem:</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Asus Zenfone 2; Google Nexus 5; HTC Droid DNA; HTC One M7, M8; LG G2 Pro, G3, G4; Motorola Droid Turbo, Moto X; Oneplus One; Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, S5, S6, S6 Edge; Samsung Note 2, 3, 4, Edge; Sony Xperia M Dual, Sony Xperia Z1, Z2, Z3, Z5; Xiaomi Mi 3, 4, Note.</span></p>
<p><b>3. Does Aero for USB-C version work with all Android phones?</b></p>
<p>Mobile phone with USB-C is quite new and we are not able to test all available phones in the market. We have tested Aero with Nexus 5X, 6P; OnePlus 2; Xiaomi Mi 4c; Le 1s.  </p>
<p><b>4. Does Aero for USB-C version work with Apple Macbook 12""?</b></p>
<p>Yes, it is plug and play compatible.</p>
<p><b>5. Does Aero work with Windows Mobile Phone?</b></p>
<p>Windows 10 mobile is the first Windows version to support USB Audio and should work (but not for the older versions).</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>6. Can I use Aero with my PC/Mac and any driver required?</b></p>
<p>Aero Micro-USB and USB-C versions can both be used with PC/Mac if they have the corresponding ports. You may need a USB adapter for conversion if you only have the USB type-A port (the big one). Windows and OSX both have native USB Audio Class 1 support and there is no need for driver installation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>7. Does Aero support microphone function?</b></p>
<p>No, Aero is designed to optimize on the music listening experience and we don't want any additional microphone circuitry to interfere. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>8. How does that compare with Bluetooth which is also digital?</b></p>
<p>Bluetooth is a wireless technology. The major problem is its bandwidth limitation. It cannot support native CD quality PCM audio streaming and requires audio compression to compensate. Aero digital earphone support 48kHz 24-bit (better than CD 44.1kHz 16-bit) source materials without any compromise on audio performance. </p>
<p><b>9. I am using Z:ero and feel great with it, should I upgrade?</b></p>
<p>Aero improves over Z:ero in a number of ways. It uses ESS SABRE 9018Q2C DAC+AMP which is a higher performance part over Wolfson DAC+AMP used in Z:ero. The Aero earphone driver (14.8mm) is a fully custom design developed to match with the whole system. We used a detachable scheme and provide different driver options for you to experiment. We used tangle-free cables and all connectors are molded in house. The overall reliability and durable are further improved. Aero enables more ways for you to enjoy music.</p>

<div>Getting into smooth production is always a challenge but it is also a fun exercise to learn new tricks. We have already manufactured 2 products (Z:ero and ZuperDAC) and are confident to produce Aero and deliver to you.</div>
</div></div>","Let's face it: you aren't quite happy with the music from your mobile phone, are you? You bought a more expensive earphone set, only to be disappointed by marginal quality improvements. It turns out that the reason to this is down to the limited audio processing capabilities inside your phone. We at Zorloo are tired of the limitations of the current earphone capabilities. 
Because of this, we designed the Aero Digital Earphones. Digital earphones are earphones that bypass the standard device audio processing unit, and recreate HiFi quality music directly through the earphone set itself via a built-in DAC (Digital to Analog Converter). Aero Digital Earphone eliminates the bottleneck that the standard processing method experiences and faithfully reproduces your music that comes out of your earphones and into your ears. With this built-in DAC and amplifier, they are not just earphones. It is a complete HiFi system. Join the revolution and free your music!













We, Andy Ho and J.W. Cha, founded Zorloo at Nov-2014. We both previously worked in the consumer electronics industry and decided to work on something new and more exciting. We love music and believe it would be great if we can create something affordable to improve the mobile audio experience.
We picked USB-Audio technology to bypass your phones internal audio circuitry which is also the bottleneck. Mobility, performance and usability are our priorities. Aero is something we have been targeting from day one. Our goal is to make the Aero experience pleasing to users, with a small size and no battery, yet outputs an amazing sound!
During this journey, we have launched 2 successful crowdfunding campaigns, 'Z:ero - World's First Digital Earphone' and 'ZuperDAC - The Portable HiFi Music USB-DAC', both in 2015. These 2 products are already in production, have been delivered to our backers and are available at our online store and different marketplaces (see Z:ero and ZuperDAC reviews here). We are not however stopping at this, but rather pushing further until we reach perfection.
Aero is our ultimate goal to deliver a fully tuned earphone with an unmatched price performance. We have been pouring all our resource and investment into Aero Digital Earphone. We are now almost there and need your support to make this happen.








 
Unlike traditional earphones getting analog signal from the 3.5mm audio jack, Aero receives digital audio data from Lightning or USB port. It is equipped with the best-of-the-class ESS SABRE 9018Q2C audio DAC with an integrated headphone amplifier. You can now carry a complete HiFi audio system in your palm!













Aero support 3 different interface standards. We have versions for:



The Apple iPhone/iPad via Lightning connector, 
Android phones via the Micro-USB connector.  

USB-C connector for Android Phone/Tablet, Windows PC/Tablet, Win-10 Mobile Phone and Apple Macbook 12"".



* See FAQ for phones we tested for compatibility.






 

Every musician and artist tries to share their inspiration and work with you. We make sure every detail is retained and faithfully reproduced. There is no guess work needed, it is simply just crystal clear audio playback. Aero digital earphone enable new ways for you to discover music, allowing you to hear the small parts and sounds you never noticed before.






Aero is the result of careful planning and research. We work with our earphone manufacturer to develop a specially designed custom driver module to deliver the best matched performance with our DAC and amplifier. The driver module is a removable part housed in a high quality aluminum chassis. We used a 14.8mm driver to deliver full range response and to make sure not a single tiny detail is missed. The dynamic coil design is controlled by specially tailored Neodymium magnetics to ensure quick and fast response.


















Aero is based on a modular design concept with HearSwap detachable driver modules. In short, that means you can interchange the driver modules to enjoy different listening experiences. At our initial launch, we have so far created three types of modules with dedicated tuning modes: Acoustic, Euphoric and Nostalgic.


Acoustic driver module (Matte Silver/Gun-Metal color) is optimized to deliver an all-rounded linear. It comes standard with the Aero earphone. 
Euphoric driver module (Glossy Gold color) adds more emphasis on bass and dynamics. It is an option sold separately.

Nostalgic driver module (Matte Copper color) has a warm sound signature. It is an option sold separately.













Aero is battery free and is light weight to conveniently carry around. They use a contoured design, with tangle-free wiring that wraps comfortably and securely behind your ears. There is not much new compared to the original Z:ero earphones regarding the controls. It uses the same volume and play/pause buttons conveniently situated on the control box. It is simply a case of plug and play with awesome sound!





  
  
We know that you will love to carry Aero around with you. Because of this, we include a convenient carrying pouch that comes with every Aero earphone set. It is just the right size to store Aero and is super easy to carry around. Aero is also pre-configured with a pair of ComplyFoam T500 isolation premium eartips to add extra comfort and isolation to your private enjoyment. There are three additional pairs of silicon gel eartips included for your selection.









* We will send you an email survey for your selection.










The shipping fee will be added when you select your country at the perk contribution checkout. We will ship Aero using your country's postal service. Tax and duties are not included. We will email you a shipment notification and your tracking number when we initiate the delivery. 
We strongly suggest you to add support@zorloo.com to your contact list (especially for gmail) so that this notification email won't be mistakenly pushed into your SPAM inbox.

1. Is Aero for Lightning version certified by Apple?
Aero is undergoing MFi certification at Apple right now. Our manufacturing factory is MFi certified so we will start the production once the certification is completed.
2. Does Aero for Micro-USB version work with all Android phones?
Due to fragmentation of Android and the unmanageable amount of different models, we are not able to guarantee the compatibility for all Android phones. We have tested with the following phones and they all work without any problem:
Asus Zenfone 2; Google Nexus 5; HTC Droid DNA; HTC One M7, M8; LG G2 Pro, G3, G4; Motorola Droid Turbo, Moto X; Oneplus One; Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, S5, S6, S6 Edge; Samsung Note 2, 3, 4, Edge; Sony Xperia M Dual, Sony Xperia Z1, Z2, Z3, Z5; Xiaomi Mi 3, 4, Note.
3. Does Aero for USB-C version work with all Android phones?
Mobile phone with USB-C is quite new and we are not able to test all available phones in the market. We have tested Aero with Nexus 5X, 6P; OnePlus 2; Xiaomi Mi 4c; Le 1s.  
4. Does Aero for USB-C version work with Apple Macbook 12""?
Yes, it is plug and play compatible.
5. Does Aero work with Windows Mobile Phone?
Windows 10 mobile is the first Windows version to support USB Audio and should work (but not for the older versions).

6. Can I use Aero with my PC/Mac and any driver required?
Aero Micro-USB and USB-C versions can both be used with PC/Mac if they have the corresponding ports. You may need a USB adapter for conversion if you only have the USB type-A port (the big one). Windows and OSX both have native USB Audio Class 1 support and there is no need for driver installation.

7. Does Aero support microphone function?
No, Aero is designed to optimize on the music listening experience and we don't want any additional microphone circuitry to interfere. 

8. How does that compare with Bluetooth which is also digital?
Bluetooth is a wireless technology. The major problem is its bandwidth limitation. It cannot support native CD quality PCM audio streaming and requires audio compression to compensate. Aero digital earphone support 48kHz 24-bit (better than CD 44.1kHz 16-bit) source materials without any compromise on audio performance. 
9. I am using Z:ero and feel great with it, should I upgrade?
Aero improves over Z:ero in a number of ways. It uses ESS SABRE 9018Q2C DAC+AMP which is a higher performance part over Wolfson DAC+AMP used in Z:ero. The Aero earphone driver (14.8mm) is a fully custom design developed to match with the whole system. We used a detachable scheme and provide different driver options for you to experiment. We used tangle-free cables and all connectors are molded in house. The overall reliability and durable are further improved. Aero enables more ways for you to enjoy music.









We have completed the Aero design and have fully working samples for all 3 versions. For the past 10 months, we have been working with our PCB and earphone factories to develop and verify our PCBA and earphone drivers. Our Aero iPhone version is undergoing Apple MFi certification right now. We already have all tooling done and will prepare materials for the production soon. 
Getting into smooth production is always a challenge but it is also a fun exercise to learn new tricks. We have already manufactured 2 products (Z:ero and ZuperDAC) and are confident to produce Aero and deliver to you.",48.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why Fund Us?</span><br/>
</h3> <p>For years, we have been lighting up homes, bars, cars, clothes, plants, pets, toilets, and art. From the beginning, we saw a need for <b>ruggedized, weather-proof</b> (and semi-waterproof!) <b>addressable</b> <b>LEDs</b> in a workable form-factor that were <b>portable</b> and <b>easy to add anywhere</b> -- flexible enough for a fur coat, yet<b> </b>rigid enough not to break at the joints. Since then, our lights have lit our <b>campsites</b> at Burning Man, projects at dozens of festivals, <b>DJ lighting</b> in bars and nightclubs around San Diego, and vehicles from skateboards<b> </b>to <b>yachts</b>. They've survived <b>hot tub parties</b> in Mexico, the staircase of the <b>""Charlie the Unicorn</b>"" art-car, they accent shelves and desks in our homes and offices, and we even have them under my truck*!</p>

<br/><p></p> </div>
<div>
<p>But for all the problems our<b> ruggedized 3-segment LEDs</b> have solved, some limitations still exist in our current product:</p>
<p></p>
<ul style=""text-align: left;"">
<li>The lights are professionally manufactured, but the ""brain"" unit is not; we have to hand-solder, heat-shrink and hot-glue each unit. The result is, frankly, that our controllers are the least-resilient link in our chain.</li>
<li>Doing bluetooth-enabled or sound-responsive projects requires adding in extra (relatively expensive) daughterboards, again with more soldering, trial-and-error, and often more than a few mistakes and re-attempts at each unit we produce.</li>
<li>Upgrading our supply chain is limited by our low margins, high manufacturing costs (because of small batch sizes) and the significant amount of time we have to spend on every sale as we solder, assemble and personally install each project. Every time we order another batch, it takes 4-6 weeks of waiting and telling our customers ""Sorry, out of stock right now""; this year, we ran out right before Burning Man, and everybody panicked!</li>
</ul>We need <b>all-in-one Brains</b> in hard plastic enclosures, and by partnering with a new <b>US manufacturer</b>, we're able to further increase the quality of our already market-changing LED segments. We need our packages <b>pre-assembled</b> out of the factory without hours of manual work for every kit. We need boxes -- <b>REAL BOXES!</b> -- so that each kit looks like something you'd buy in stores -- <b>REAL STORES!</b> Here at JuiceJuice, we are committed to delivering the brightest smiles possible, but right now <b>we just can't deliver them fast enough</b>. You can help us light up the world; get us the funding we need to ramp up production!<p></p>

<div><h3>A Word About Colors</h3></div>
<div>We keep saying ""rainbows"" because, let's be honest, <b>rainbow is the best color</b>. Everything defaults to rainbows, and you will be happy and prosperous if you just leave them like that forever,<b> a fortune cookie told us so</b>.</div>
<div>But our lights will do <b>any patterns</b>, color combinations and fade effects you can possibly dream up. We're even building a way for you to <b>design your own</b> and put them on an SD card.</div>
<div>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F137075959&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F137075959&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F531832883_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>
</div>
<div>We're going to include a base set of <b>at least 30 novel patterns</b> - Possibly even some more kinds of rainbows! Most of the patterns will be <b>optionally sound responsive</b>, and many of them will support setting the hues of the pattern from a color wheel in the phone app. <b>If you just love maroon</b>, you can make <b>everything maroon</b> -- shooting stars, dancing flames, chasing waves, <b>blah, blah, blah</b>.

<h3>The Sparks and The Brains</h3>
<p>The Sparks are WS2812b modules running at 5 volts. The clear IP67 (that means ""<b>almost completely water-and-dust-proof</b>"") epoxy coat and novel 3-LED hard PCB format are of our own design, though we've seen them imitated (ahem, poorly) from several suppliers. We've gone through tons of iterations to perfect our construction of what we believe to be one of the most <b>convenient, flexible and long-lasting</b> addressable LED products on the market.</p>
<p>They come in 3-inch <b>segments of 3 LEDs</b>, spaced 1.5"" apart. Each 5-foot strand is <b>12 segments</b>, for a total of 36 LEDs, and terminated with 3-pin IP67 screw-on caps.</p>
<p>The sparks are weather-proof, and great for outdoor applications as well. We use them in the snow, in the mud, in the garden and by the pool. We must legally insist you do not try submerging them, in swimming pools, fish tanks or otherwise. <b>Do not take JuiceJuice Sparks into your hot tub. You may observe that they do light up underwater, but it is. not. safe. Keep Brain and Power Supply in a dry location. DO NOT PLAY WITH ELECTRICITY AND WATER.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440360762/cptiulyx24gqz0nrxxqc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our control units are Arduino-based boards upgraded with Bluetooth, a realtime clock, an SD slot for custom patterns and a microphone. We include a high-wattage 12v barrel plug for wall-socket applications, but you can also run up to 100 lights off USB, such as portable battery packs, car adapters or <b>*shudder*</b> even technically your laptop.  Use the 12v adapter for more than 100 lights, always.</p>
<p>We'll distribute the sketches for all the patterns we design so you can modify your own designs and make anything you like. It's also in our aspirations to create a GUI-based<b> pattern designer</b> in the phone app, but this is not within the immediate scope of our project, so we've made it a Stretch Goal.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We think the minimum amount we can reasonably accept for meeting these goals is <b>$75,000 green American monies</b> (but IndieGoGo will take AUR and EUR as well!)</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442122214/n0twxehk3swrzxic0vgb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>One <b>Basic Kit</b> is $200 and includes 2x Spark Strips, each a 5-foot string of 36 LEDs in 12 segments of 3, which you can chain together end-to-end for a 10-foot strip. You get 1 Brain, which can drive up to 500 LEDs (70 feet!), and the necessary power supply. For our first 100 backers, to show our utmost appreciation, we'll forego any margin and deliver them to you at-cost, $160 flat (plus shipping).</p>
<p>We also offer a <b>Mega Kit </b>for $350, which has twice as many LEDs, in case your addiction to visual stimulation is both impulsive and insatiable like ours. With 1 Brain and 4x 5-foot Spark Strips, you can wrap a VW bus in colors and patterns faster and easier than a team of hippies with paintbrushes (plus our lights can take a shower).</p>
<p>We offer <b>price breaks</b> as you buy more kits all the way up to $2,500. For larger orders, just contact us, because we're used to working on <b>big projects</b>. Beyond 10+ Mega Kits, there are lots more things to keep in mind about placement, power and synchronization. Let's just have a quick phone call before we accept so much cash from you.</p>
<p>One more thing -- We believe businesses are people, too, and that implies a <b>moral</b> <b>obligation</b> for them to do good. Just as we feel an individual should donate 10% of their earnings to charity, we are budgeting <b>10% of our profits</b> from IndieGoGo to spread light around the world. <b>There are dark villages in Africa</b>, literally unlit, and we cannot with clean conscious sell you amazing beautiful luxury lights for your first-world-lifestyle without also allocating some money to mail boxes of solar lights to <b>every dark corner of the earth</b>. The price of doing business with our company is your complete agreement to these ideals.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<div>We really hope you like our lights. We hope we meet our goals.</div>
<div>But we're builders and we won't be satisfied at that --</div>
<div> Our plans to grow our capabilities are ambitious and exciting.</div>
<div> Here's some things we plan to do in the future, and if we hit higher funding goals, we'll stop ""planning"" and start on them right away.</div>
<div><ul style=""text-align: left;"">
<li>$150,000 - Code Tutorial: Right after we deliver our initial offering, we plan on making a ""How To Code Light Patterns"" tutorial. It will cover the basics of Arduino programming, the Processing language, and doing some simple-to-moderately-complex effects. Not only will these tutorials be available free for everyone, we'll mail 10 kits to local San Diego schools to help teach kids to code through a charity we are starting called Bright Young Minds.</li>
<li>$250,00 - Point-and-Click Pattern Designer: Use your phone app to design any pattern you want, save it for later, sync it to other Brains and make it yours. If you can dream it, you can make it, no coding skills required.</li>
<li>$400,000 - Pattern Sharing Social Site - An online library for sharing and trading patterns; a secure and fun way to download new effects from other users around the world.</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>
Whenever bringing a product to market, many challenges can arise and many expensive road blocks can arise.<br/>
</div>
<p>On the one hand, there's the immediate risk that we won't make our funding goal. We'll do our best to still make as many improvements to the brains as we can and ship the lights.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>On the other hand, the risk does exist that we collect the full $75,000 and either under-budgeted or mis-calculated the costs of the project. Look, we feel good about this plan. We think we can make it work. And we are honest dudes who will do the right thing at every step of the way, no matter what comes up. Your investment in our project entitles you to the very best product our efforts can muster, but you must agree to usual the risks of a crowd-funding campaign.</p>
<p>Also, our timeline right now is all based on VERY ROUGH estimates; before donating, please know that we hope to achieve all our dreams and deliver by the end of January, but it could be 2 months late, a week early, or whatever. </p>

The lights are professionally manufactured, but the ""brain"" unit is not; we have to hand-solder, heat-shrink and hot-glue each unit. The result is, frankly, that our controllers are the least-resilient link in our chain.
Doing bluetooth-enabled or sound-responsive projects requires adding in extra (relatively expensive) daughterboards, again with more soldering, trial-and-error, and often more than a few mistakes and re-attempts at each unit we produce.
Upgrading our supply chain is limited by our low margins, high manufacturing costs (because of small batch sizes) and the significant amount of time we have to spend on every sale as we solder, assemble and personally install each project. Every time we order another batch, it takes 4-6 weeks of waiting and telling our customers ""Sorry, out of stock right now""; this year, we ran out right before Burning Man, and everybody panicked!
We need all-in-one Brains in hard plastic enclosures, and by partnering with a new US manufacturer, we're able to further increase the quality of our already market-changing LED segments. We need our packages pre-assembled out of the factory without hours of manual work for every kit. We need boxes -- REAL BOXES! -- so that each kit looks like something you'd buy in stores -- REAL STORES! Here at JuiceJuice, we are committed to delivering the brightest smiles possible, but right now we just can't deliver them fast enough. You can help us light up the world; get us the funding we need to ramp up production!






At the completion of our campaign, we guarantee that (parts of) your life will be no less than 1,000 times brighter-and-more-colorful than ever before*.

(* based on assumption that you had no rainbow lights ever before)






A Word About Colors
We keep saying ""rainbows"" because, let's be honest, rainbow is the best color. Everything defaults to rainbows, and you will be happy and prosperous if you just leave them like that forever, a fortune cookie told us so.
But our lights will do any patterns, color combinations and fade effects you can possibly dream up. We're even building a way for you to design your own and put them on an SD card.



We're going to include a base set of at least 30 novel patterns - Possibly even some more kinds of rainbows! Most of the patterns will be optionally sound responsive, and many of them will support setting the hues of the pattern from a color wheel in the phone app. If you just love maroon, you can make everything maroon -- shooting stars, dancing flames, chasing waves, blah, blah, blah. Paint a wall Red, White and Blue for the Olympics. Scare away cats and unwanted guests with sound-activated strobe lights.





Want green explosions in your bookshelf, purple waves down your staircase and red lava around the tub? No problem. Switch your bed frame to red heartbeats, put on some Barry White, BOOM! Date night. And on a Saturday night, sound-activated rainbows turn absolutely any occasion into a dance party.
ANY.
OCCASION.


The Sparks and The Brains
The Sparks are WS2812b modules running at 5 volts. The clear IP67 (that means ""almost completely water-and-dust-proof"") epoxy coat and novel 3-LED hard PCB format are of our own design, though we've seen them imitated (ahem, poorly) from several suppliers. We've gone through tons of iterations to perfect our construction of what we believe to be one of the most convenient, flexible and long-lasting addressable LED products on the market.
They come in 3-inch segments of 3 LEDs, spaced 1.5"" apart. Each 5-foot strand is 12 segments, for a total of 36 LEDs, and terminated with 3-pin IP67 screw-on caps.
The sparks are weather-proof, and great for outdoor applications as well. We use them in the snow, in the mud, in the garden and by the pool. We must legally insist you do not try submerging them, in swimming pools, fish tanks or otherwise. Do not take JuiceJuice Sparks into your hot tub. You may observe that they do light up underwater, but it is. not. safe. Keep Brain and Power Supply in a dry location. DO NOT PLAY WITH ELECTRICITY AND WATER.


Our control units are Arduino-based boards upgraded with Bluetooth, a realtime clock, an SD slot for custom patterns and a microphone. We include a high-wattage 12v barrel plug for wall-socket applications, but you can also run up to 100 lights off USB, such as portable battery packs, car adapters or *shudder* even technically your laptop.  Use the 12v adapter for more than 100 lights, always.
We'll distribute the sketches for all the patterns we design so you can modify your own designs and make anything you like. It's also in our aspirations to create a GUI-based pattern designer in the phone app, but this is not within the immediate scope of our project, so we've made it a Stretch Goal.

What We Need & What You Get
We think the minimum amount we can reasonably accept for meeting these goals is $75,000 green American monies (but IndieGoGo will take AUR and EUR as well!)




One Basic Kit is $200 and includes 2x Spark Strips, each a 5-foot string of 36 LEDs in 12 segments of 3, which you can chain together end-to-end for a 10-foot strip. You get 1 Brain, which can drive up to 500 LEDs (70 feet!), and the necessary power supply. For our first 100 backers, to show our utmost appreciation, we'll forego any margin and deliver them to you at-cost, $160 flat (plus shipping).
We also offer a Mega Kit for $350, which has twice as many LEDs, in case your addiction to visual stimulation is both impulsive and insatiable like ours. With 1 Brain and 4x 5-foot Spark Strips, you can wrap a VW bus in colors and patterns faster and easier than a team of hippies with paintbrushes (plus our lights can take a shower).
We offer price breaks as you buy more kits all the way up to $2,500. For larger orders, just contact us, because we're used to working on big projects. Beyond 10+ Mega Kits, there are lots more things to keep in mind about placement, power and synchronization. Let's just have a quick phone call before we accept so much cash from you.
One more thing -- We believe businesses are people, too, and that implies a moral obligation for them to do good. Just as we feel an individual should donate 10% of their earnings to charity, we are budgeting 10% of our profits from IndieGoGo to spread light around the world. There are dark villages in Africa, literally unlit, and we cannot with clean conscious sell you amazing beautiful luxury lights for your first-world-lifestyle without also allocating some money to mail boxes of solar lights to every dark corner of the earth. The price of doing business with our company is your complete agreement to these ideals.

Stretch Goals
We really hope you like our lights. We hope we meet our goals.
But we're builders and we won't be satisfied at that --
 Our plans to grow our capabilities are ambitious and exciting.
 Here's some things we plan to do in the future, and if we hit higher funding goals, we'll stop ""planning"" and start on them right away.

$150,000 - Code Tutorial: Right after we deliver our initial offering, we plan on making a ""How To Code Light Patterns"" tutorial. It will cover the basics of Arduino programming, the Processing language, and doing some simple-to-moderately-complex effects. Not only will these tutorials be available free for everyone, we'll mail 10 kits to local San Diego schools to help teach kids to code through a charity we are starting called Bright Young Minds.
$250,00 - Point-and-Click Pattern Designer: Use your phone app to design any pattern you want, save it for later, sync it to other Brains and make it yours. If you can dream it, you can make it, no coding skills required.
$400,000 - Pattern Sharing Social Site - An online library for sharing and trading patterns; a secure and fun way to download new effects from other users around the world.



    Risks & Challenges

Whenever bringing a product to market, many challenges can arise and many expensive road blocks can arise.

On the one hand, there's the immediate risk that we won't make our funding goal. We'll do our best to still make as many improvements to the brains as we can and ship the lights.


On the other hand, the risk does exist that we collect the full $75,000 and either under-budgeted or mis-calculated the costs of the project. Look, we feel good about this plan. We think we can make it work. And we are honest dudes who will do the right thing at every step of the way, no matter what comes up. Your investment in our project entitles you to the very best product our efforts can muster, but you must agree to usual the risks of a crowd-funding campaign.
Also, our timeline right now is all based on VERY ROUGH estimates; before donating, please know that we hope to achieve all our dreams and deliver by the end of January, but it could be 2 months late, a week early, or whatever.

<p></p></div>","Mycelium Entropy is a small USB device with a single purpose: Making it easy to create Bitcoin paper wallets in a secure controlled environment.Paper wallets are created in 3 simple steps:

Insert Mycelium Entropy into a printer that allows you to print pictures from a USB flash drive.


Select the print option on the printer.


There is no step 3.

This way the paper wallet has never touched a computer or a network, and as soon as you eject the device the private key is wiped from memory.Mycelium Entropy is the easiest and most secure way of creating a paper wallet for offline cold storage.How does it work?When Mycelium Entropy is inserted into a USB socket, it powers up and generates a large random number based on hardware entropy. That number is turned into a Bitcoin private key and a Bitcoin address. The private key and the address are turned into QR codes and and stored in a JPG file, and the USB device presents itself as a USB flash drive. This allows a printer that can print photos off a USB flash drive to print the paper wallet directly off the device.Here is a paper wallet sample: http://i.imgur.com/L36LZgY.jpgThe hardware based entropy is collected by using a chip with static RAM as the source of entropy, as described in the scientific paper: Power-up SRAM State as an Identifying Fingerprint and Source of True Random Numbers (Holcomb, D.E.; Burleson, W.P.; Fu, K.).Quote from the article: ""We demonstrate that a 512-bite SRAM fingerprint contains sufficient entropy to generate 128-bit true random numbers, and that the generated numbers pass the NIST tests for runs, approximate entropy, and block-frequency.""Because Mycelium Entropy collects entropy from tens of thousands of SRAM cells, the result is impossible to guess. Every time you plug the device into a USB port, the power-up process makes the SRAM cells contain a completely random state, allowing the chip to create a different high entropy random number. This allows you to make as many safe and secure paper wallets as you wish.When paired with the Mycelium Bitcoin Wallet, with its ability to spend directly from cold storage paper wallets, storing and using Bitcoin securely becomes very easy for anyone.Here is a video showing Jan, one of our lead developers, demonstrating the prototype:Mycelium Entropy will be 100% open source, and uses off-the-shelf components.

<p><span style=""color: #ff6600;""> 1.5 Billion people</span> around the world live without a reliable source of electricity and are forced to turn to unsafe, unhealthy, expensive, environmentally unfriendly kerosene lamps among other forms of unhealthy lighting.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.unite-to-light.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unite to Light</a> is a non-profit based in Santa Barbara, California created to address this problem. Our lights are designed and developed at the Institute for Energy Efficiency at UC Santa Barbara. We are a growing community of people working to send solar powered products around the world as an alternative to kerosene lamps. Our first product, an all-purpose solar powered LED (UTL-1), addresses our goal of greatly reducing, even eliminating, kerosene use in developing countries.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #ff6600;""><strong>But we can't stop there! </strong></span>There are currently more cell phones than people in the world, and every year a new small electronic device offers opportunities for individuals to learn and connect. We need your help producing our next product, the UTL-C, a cellphone and e-reader charging light!</p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Imagine the possibilities of the UTL-C in the developing world!</span></strong> With your help we will be able to continue to provide an alternative to kerosene, and in addition, we give someone the possibility of charging their cellphone and e-reader sustainably. In developing countries a cell phone is someone's lifeline. Cell phones improve profits for small business owners and farmers, are a cheaper and faster way of communication, increase productivity, and provide many other benefits we take for granted. Since many individuals in developing countries often do not have electricity, they often travel for miles and pay a lot to charge their cell phones. Having their own solar charger and light will save them time and money.</p>

<p>With 1.5 billion people living without reliable electricity and relying on their cellphones for work and study, a personal <span style=""color: #ff6600;"">USB charging capability </span> solves a problem and offers an environmentally friendly alternative. For those who live, work, study or play off the grid, the concept of solar energy for simple functions such as lighting and USB charging makes sense.

When a professor and pastor from Ghana visited the Institute for Energy Efficiency at UC Santa Barbara they explained the problem of children not having a <span style=""color: #ff6600;""> healthy and safe</span> form of light at night for their studies. With their visit as the driving force, Unite to Light was created in 2010 to address the concerns of kerosene use. We are dedicated to providing <span style=""color: #ff6600;""> low cost lighting </span>to those without electricity, and eliminating the health and environmental issues associated with existing light sources used by this population. In doing so, we will allow families the opportunity to work, study, and play in the evening while <span style=""color: #ff6600;""> breathing clean (healthy) air.</span></p>
<p>We have designed lights for this purpose, and are partnering with organizations on the ground in communities around the world to distribute lights for purchase. Parents are able to better feed their families and send children to school with the money they save by not buying kerosene, candles, and orther short term lighting sources. In turn, Unite to Light is able to produce and distribute more lights on an ongoing basis. </p>

 1.5 Billion people around the world live without a reliable source of electricity and are forced to turn to unsafe, unhealthy, expensive, environmentally unfriendly kerosene lamps among other forms of unhealthy lighting.
  
Unite to Light is a non-profit based in Santa Barbara, California created to address this problem. Our lights are designed and developed at the Institute for Energy Efficiency at UC Santa Barbara. We are a growing community of people working to send solar powered products around the world as an alternative to kerosene lamps. Our first product, an all-purpose solar powered LED (UTL-1), addresses our goal of greatly reducing, even eliminating, kerosene use in developing countries.
But we can't stop there! There are currently more cell phones than people in the world, and every year a new small electronic device offers opportunities for individuals to learn and connect. We need your help producing our next product, the UTL-C, a cellphone and e-reader charging light!
Imagine the possibilities of the UTL-C in the developing world! With your help we will be able to continue to provide an alternative to kerosene, and in addition, we give someone the possibility of charging their cellphone and e-reader sustainably. In developing countries a cell phone is someone's lifeline. Cell phones improve profits for small business owners and farmers, are a cheaper and faster way of communication, increase productivity, and provide many other benefits we take for granted. Since many individuals in developing countries often do not have electricity, they often travel for miles and pay a lot to charge their cell phones. Having their own solar charger and light will save them time and money.

With 1.5 billion people living without reliable electricity and relying on their cellphones for work and study, a personal USB charging capability  solves a problem and offers an environmentally friendly alternative. For those who live, work, study or play off the grid, the concept of solar energy for simple functions such as lighting and USB charging makes sense. The sun provides 1kW of power per square meter, why waste it?
 
Who Are We 
Unite to Light is a non-profit located in Santa Barbara, California. When a professor and pastor from Ghana visited the Institute for Energy Efficiency at UC Santa Barbara they explained the problem of children not having a  healthy and safe form of light at night for their studies. With their visit as the driving force, Unite to Light was created in 2010 to address the concerns of kerosene use. We are dedicated to providing  low cost lighting to those without electricity, and eliminating the health and environmental issues associated with existing light sources used by this population. In doing so, we will allow families the opportunity to work, study, and play in the evening while  breathing clean (healthy) air.
We have designed lights for this purpose, and are partnering with organizations on the ground in communities around the world to distribute lights for purchase. Parents are able to better feed their families and send children to school with the money they save by not buying kerosene, candles, and orther short term lighting sources. In turn, Unite to Light is able to produce and distribute more lights on an ongoing basis. 
For more information please visit www.unite-to-light.org.

Why We Need Your Help
Right now the cost of manufacturing the UTL-C is  too expensive  for the developing world. We need  your help  to subsidize the initial costs of the UTL-C and help pay for the mold and prototypes. With your help we can remove the burden (cost) of the mold and protoypes from our end users, and provide the  cheapest UTL-C possible. With lower prices, we can reach a wider range of individuals and families that can benefit from the UTL-C.

Your Impact

Your contribution will give individuals and families the  gift of light and the possibility of increasing their  quality of life. The map below shows the countries where we are making a difference. Together we can light up the world country by country.

Quotes from around the world
“My name is Lewis Ayenza. I am in class eight, Mr. Kimathi gave me a solar lamp. Now I can read about 2 hours when I go home at night. I can work hard because my mother can take the solar lamp and keep it under the sun to charge. We do not have electricity and sometimes we were not having money for buying paraffin. But now as I have that solar lamp it helps me and I read and do my studies well. Am so happy about it.” -- Lewis A.  (Kenya)
""We were able to bring to village these really cool solar powered reading lights. The villagers loved them, and everyone wanted to take one home. They have no electricity in the village and fires in their homes (most have thatched straw roofs, the richer people have tin), lung disease from breathing smoke (they use wood and dung to cook with) and burns from injuries while working and using fire are common. I made it clear the lights were to stay in their new library, and that I would return to America to try to raise money for more for village homes."" -  HANDS in NEPAL , one of our partners.
""As a [Peace Corps] teacher in Ghana, I’ve never heard the ‘My dog ate my homework’ excuse but I have heard ‘Madam, I couldn’t do my homework because we don’t have lights.’"" - Stephanie, a Peace Corps volunteer in  Ghana.
""One of the couples on the trip brought lights from Unite to Light to give to the native Tarahumara people (they call themselves the Rarámuri) who live in cliff side dwellings and use kerosene lamps for light. I got to see first hand the impact of the blackened walls and can only imagine the damage being done to the lungs of the children and the people. It is truly a wonderful thing that you are doing. Thank you for your global concern and generosity."" by Fritz (Mexico)
""The Unite to Light solar lights were a BIG hit with the teachers! Uganda is a land where the power is constantly going out in the evening, and the acrid small of burning trash with kerosene and diesel cars makes for a very toxic environment. There were most days when I never saw a blue sky.

""I’ve noticed that their academic performances are improving, their punctuality to school in the morning has also improved... We would be very grateful if we get more lamps for those who didn’t get one."" -- Headmaster Kingston K  (Kenya), commenting on the performance of his students who received a light.

</h1><h4><b>about my patent pending product, let me start with a joke</b></h4>
<p>
</p><p>When
Mother Theresa opened her eyes for the first time after she died, she
realized she was in Paradise. God appeared from nowhere and He gave
her a little tray with a tuna sandwich and an open bottle of water.</p>
<p>She
sat down on a fluffy cloud to have her breakfast and started
observing the surrounding area. When she looked down through the
clouds, she was quite surprised to discover that people in Hell were
having fun - eating, drinking, singing and dancing. To her amazement,
she observed the same thing for many days in a row while eating the
same breakfast every morning. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One
day, she became angry, went to God and said, “God, I think there is
something wrong in Paradise. For many days in a row I'm having a tuna
sandwich and water and for many days in a row I'm watching that the
sinners down there in Hell are having fun – eating, drinking,
singing and dancing...”</p>
<p>“I
know, I know, my dear', God said, “I know very well, but believe
me, it is not worth cooking for only two people...”</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm
sharing this joke with you not to belittle our human race, but to let
you know that even <b>God
needs an opener to conduct his quotidian business</b>
– tackling a can of tuna, a bottle of water, and a sealed bag of
bread delivered to Paradise from a faraway bakery. 
</p>
<p>The
same applies to us, the mortals. This is the reason and my
inspiration to create

BACKGROUND
</b><p>All
kinds of openers colonize our present day kitchen where we spend time
to prepare and enjoy food. The typical opener serves a particular
purpose – one to open wine bottles, another for food cans, a third
kind for beer bottles, etc. That's why there are at least several
different instruments of this caliber in each household. Usually,
they end up scattered, easily misplaced and, sometimes, difficult to
locate when needed. Through the years, as we all know, diverse
openers with various degrees of practicality have been introduced to
the market; however, a few appear to fit the description of
multifunctionality (and aesthetically pleasing, too).</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b></b></h4><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/697786/files/20140706141521-tri.jpg?1404681321"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>(the)
PROJECT
</b><p>I
hope that the above image gives you a sense that my invention is
substantially different from the existing concepts and designs within
this category. It is a novel, multipurpose device, and its
versatility exceeds that of any other opener currently available on
the market. It is a tool with which you will be able to open wine
bottles, beer bottles, champagne bottles, soft drink bottles, food
cans, tins, jars, medicine bottles, ampoules, paint cans and sealed
plastic bags. Also, the apparatus is wittingly appealing - it
resembles a dog (man’s/woman’s best friend), with functional
“body parts”, and a handle that will come in a variety of
colours.</p>
<p></p><h4><b></b></h4><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/697790/files/20140706141556-tri.jpg?1404681356"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>(the)

idea came to me a few years ago, when my wife and I were at a
friend’s garden party. Throughout the evening I kept noticing that
hosts and guests were looking for different openers. I also noticed
that the gadgets not only had limited functionality, but they were
not easy to find. A night or two later while I was lying in bed, I
had an imaginative flash. As you know, ideas can visit you not only
when you are taking a shower. The bright light of the morning did not
kill the idea – just in the contrary – imbedded it in my mind.
Its seed started to grow, expanding in shape and size – a
multifunctional tool, designed to open “everything” - bank
accounts being an exception, obviously. I also wanted this opener to
perfectly connect the 3Fs (form, fit, function) and bring excitement,
surprise, fun and satisfaction to demanding customers. For more than
a year I felt like a pregnant man, carrying the idea everywhere and
thinking about it all the time when I wasn't in the office.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">On
the path of developing the idea, I held my own hand for a long time.
Hundreds of hours were spent researching patent bureaus. People are
usually happy when they find what they are looking for – I was
happy to discover that no product of a similar nature existed on the
market.</span><br/></p>
<p>At
one point my internal ultrasound revealed that the idea deserved to
be developed. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Then
I lit the lampshade on my head for another year – tweaking,
removing, adding and changing. Then </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I
started with the drawings as they had to be accurate, showing
measurements and shape of the “guts”. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">After
that I spent another few weeks writing the abstract: how the elements
of the invention work together.</span></p>

I spent another month reviewing product marketability and variables
affecting it. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Interested
to know about them? I’ll mention just a few: cost, ease of use,
ease of production, durability, novelty, ecological impact,
saleability, appearance, market size, sexy packaging, long life cycle,
disadvantages of existing products, service requirements, existing
production facilities, etc…</span></p>
<p>I
grew accustomed to working on this project almost everyday – until
one day I realized I could not change anything else. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">A
week passed – no further adjustments came to mind. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Another

The market size is impressive: for example, there are 125 million
households in both Canada and the USA, 200 million in Europe, and
billions more in Asia, Africa and Australia. In short, there is a
remarkable opportunity for a multifunctional, humouristic,
problem-solving product like my tool to help many people worldwide.

I consider myself to be a curious person, my colleagues, clients,

day I was searching a portal cloud atop the Piratebay in Babylon,
when I met an androidian amazon from Nokia galaxy.</p>
<p>I
stumbled upon her blogspot from a far away network. She was an HD
resolution Samsung in a 3D console. We connected our platforms with
dense metatags, until we were just about to linkedin.</p>
<p>“Hi5
Bebo”, I uploaded my first keywords, “My name is Sony Ericsson.
I’m an imgur from Netflix.”</p>
<p>“Wee-Nook”,
she bounced back, viewing me through her googles. “I’m 2.0
Virgin. And I’m delicio.us open source”.</p>
<p>“‘I
like your definition. Digg an apple?”</p>
<p>“Is
it hard, or microsoft?”, she rebooted. ”I’ll reddit, but my
playstation prefers blackberry.”</p>
<p>“You
could be a good paypal, you know!” I subscribed, while orkutting a
slice and wordpressing it down her wikipedia.</p>
<p>L8R,
in a few snippets of code we streamed to the chatroom in myspace. She
wanted to tumblr on my laptop and flickr with facebook, although I
emailed all my friends to browse my tablet at home, not on social
media. While I was installing my account, she processed her username
- nerdishly, like a webcentric hacker.</p>
<p>“Retrieve
my password”, she displayed.</p>
<p>“Yo”,
I activated the server.</p>
<p>She
was given access to Instagram immediately, and she went there to PC.
Thinking about her vube and how to blogher made my sound card very
hot, I minimized the windows. We sat on the i-pod to touchscreen our
content. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Her
software made me click the “like” button. We blogspotted
together. Our batteries were recharging and our systems seemed to be
compatible.</span></p>
<p>“Ask,
I’m the administrator,” I reset the forum.</p>
<p>“No,
you are just Alibaba – the netman, the dreamweaver”, she
responded online. 
</p>
<p>“Do
you like my activation?”, I hosted wirelessly.</p>
<p>“Kindle”,
she 4shared. “AOL”.</p>
<p>Then
I msned in her bluetooth, “You got male, hotmail.”</p>
<p>“Are
going to nokia me down, bing me, and KMN? If yes, do you mind showing
me your hardware on Craigslist?”</p>
<p>“Just
don’t ask for Mac”, I upgraded, “I’ll help you develop your
app with my handset. But first, let me download in your youtube!”</p>
<p>“Go”,
the android phished, “Go daddy, just save the chip!”</p>
<p>Her
interface was glaring with emoticons. She clicked the ctrl key to
access my keyboard. The avatar on the monitor blinked, “Your
macintosh has been deleted.”</p>
<p>My
X-box posted the feedback, “According to this program, mails
are the ones, femails are the zeros - virtually.”</p>
<p>We
timblred on the motorola. She was very mobile and the algorithm was
near perfect.</p>
<p>“No
wikileaks, no widgets, please,” she shared, “I have no firewall!”</p>
<p>“GR8!”,
I noticed my bandwidth turned from dot com to unlimited.</p>
<p>I
started sexting in real time. The traffic was terrific and she was
roaming all over the net with her cellular.</p>
<p>“Type,
type, faster!”, she gigabyted  from her vimeo site.</p>
<p>In
a few rackspaces she started tweeting with joy, reaching pick-load
capacity. Suddenly, an adword popped up on E-bay. The message
informed us that our session was over - it was subscription based. We
both pixelated. Baidu way ppl, lol -  groupon of two sounds
pinteresting on all search engines.</p>

<b><i>Why

            </i></b>
</p><p>
<i><em>Not
because Indiegogo has worldwide reach. Not because it is based on the
principles of opportunity and transparency. I decided to use
Indiegogo after I carefully researched the crowdsourcing market. The
web based platform was chosen as the final winner because it allows
me to choose a campaign, it allows people to pay via Paypal or credit
cards, it encourages a competition for its front page and it lets me
keep whatever is raised. Also, I like the community spirit they
managed to raise over the last few years.</em></i></p><p><b><i>What
do I look like?</i></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/696131/files/20140705121736-marin_autop.jpg?1404587856"" src="""" style=""width: 160.7957746478873px; height: 258px;""/></p><p><b><i>Has
anyone besides my mother ever said nice things about the project?</i></b></p><p>Several
of my closest friends. Before you, they were the only people who knew
about the project. 
</p><p><b><i>Why
a flexible vs. fixed campaign? </i></b></p><p><em><b></b></em><em>The project has several steps to complete – depending on money
raised I can successfully finish one, two, or three steps. If the
project raises much more money than its goal of $10,000, it will be
completed in its entirety.</em>
</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><i>Does
my product meet a genuine consumer need?</i></b><br/></p><p></p><p>
Market
research was conducted – the consumer interest and need exist, the
simplicity and sophistication of the product makes it salable in many
corners of the world, and the market for this type of consumer
product is big.</p><p><b><i>If
this product addresses a need and performs well, what will be its
price?</i></b></p><p>The
retail price of the tool will be in the mom-and-pop convenient range
of $25.99-$35.99. 
</p><p>
</p><p><b><i>What
are my further plans in developing the opener?</i></b></p><p>The
product will be licensed to a well-established firm with a good track
record and existing distribution channels. 
</p><p>
</p><p><b><i>Will
$10,000.00 be sufficient to move the product development one step
ahead?</i></b></p><p>If
successful in raising the amount on indiegogo.com, this will cover
the legal fees related to the patent application. Any excess will be
used towards the next few steps – creating and testing prototypes,
registering the trademark and signing a license agreement. 
</p><p>$10,000.00
will be my bottom line, as running out of gas part way across the
desert could lead to unnecessary delays.

</p><p><b><i>Do
I have a good team of people to help see threats and opportunities
lying ahead? </i></b>
</p><p>Every
team is nothing but an extension of the project. Being “in the
bottle” does not give me the opportunity to read the label, so I
selected a diverse group of individuals as my first line of
supporters and critics. They possess various skills, occupations,
tastes and connections.

it is:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/696138/files/20140705122354-timeline.jpg?1404588234"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><i>How
much did the project cost so far?</i></b></p><p>With
the exception of $125 USD for the provisional patent application and
$15 for registering the domain name <a href=""http://www.yopen.ca,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.yopen.ca,</a> this project cost
me no money – all the research, product development, writing,
drawings, rendering and even the video for indiegogo.com was created
by me. 
</p><p>
</p><p><b><i>What
will be the key success factors for the project?</i></b></p><p>I'll
do my best to make the gadget a success story – largely based on
its uniqueness, novelty, superiority, fun, and price.</p><p>
</p><p><b><i>How
do I plan to spend the money raised? </i></b>
</p><p>If
$10,000.00 is raised they’ll be used to pay a patent lawyer – to
create the claims for the tool. If more than $10,000.00 is raised, it
will be spent on further product development – even finishing it in
its entirety.</p><p>
</p><p><b><i>Are
there going to be additional rewards for the indiegogo contributors?</i></b></p><p>Yes,
all people investing more than $50 on the project will receive an
opener with an engraved handle, shipped to them after the project
passes its manufacturing stage and the tool becomes available for
distribution. Please be patient – this will take time, therefore it
will be like an unexpected surprise in the future.</p><p><strong><b><i>If
you can’t donate, how else can you help? </i></b></strong></p><p><strong><b></b></strong><em>If
you are not ready to pledge money, please pledge your support: share
the word of my campaign - if you like the project. Share the drive
via Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram, Reddit and good old
fashioned email. Share it often - once a week or so. This helps a lot
because every time someone visits my indiegogo page, comments or
shares it, the campaign keeps trending. </em>

do you plan to deliver the perks? </i></b></p><p><em><b></b></em><em>All
perks (with the exception of the real product - which will be

</div></div>","Although
dead serious 
about my patent pending product, let me start with a joke

When
Mother Theresa opened her eyes for the first time after she died, she
realized she was in Paradise. God appeared from nowhere and He gave
her a little tray with a tuna sandwich and an open bottle of water.
She
sat down on a fluffy cloud to have her breakfast and started
observing the surrounding area. When she looked down through the
clouds, she was quite surprised to discover that people in Hell were
having fun - eating, drinking, singing and dancing. To her amazement,
she observed the same thing for many days in a row while eating the
same breakfast every morning. 


One
day, she became angry, went to God and said, “God, I think there is
something wrong in Paradise. For many days in a row I'm having a tuna
sandwich and water and for many days in a row I'm watching that the
sinners down there in Hell are having fun – eating, drinking,
singing and dancing...”
“I
know, I know, my dear', God said, “I know very well, but believe
me, it is not worth cooking for only two people...”

I'm
sharing this joke with you not to belittle our human race, but to let
you know that even God
needs an opener to conduct his quotidian business
– tackling a can of tuna, a bottle of water, and a sealed bag of
bread delivered to Paradise from a faraway bakery. 

The
same applies to us, the mortals. This is the reason and my
inspiration to create 


the
ultimate 
multipurpose
household
tool,
(the)
BACKGROUND
All
kinds of openers colonize our present day kitchen where we spend time
to prepare and enjoy food. The typical opener serves a particular
purpose – one to open wine bottles, another for food cans, a third
kind for beer bottles, etc. That's why there are at least several
different instruments of this caliber in each household. Usually,
they end up scattered, easily misplaced and, sometimes, difficult to
locate when needed. Through the years, as we all know, diverse
openers with various degrees of practicality have been introduced to
the market; however, a few appear to fit the description of
multifunctionality (and aesthetically pleasing, too).

(the)
PROJECT
I
hope that the above image gives you a sense that my invention is
substantially different from the existing concepts and designs within
this category. It is a novel, multipurpose device, and its
versatility exceeds that of any other opener currently available on
the market. It is a tool with which you will be able to open wine
bottles, beer bottles, champagne bottles, soft drink bottles, food
cans, tins, jars, medicine bottles, ampoules, paint cans and sealed
plastic bags. Also, the apparatus is wittingly appealing - it
resembles a dog (man’s/woman’s best friend), with functional
“body parts”, and a handle that will come in a variety of
colours.
(the)
STORYThe
idea came to me a few years ago, when my wife and I were at a
friend’s garden party. Throughout the evening I kept noticing that
hosts and guests were looking for different openers. I also noticed
that the gadgets not only had limited functionality, but they were
not easy to find. A night or two later while I was lying in bed, I
had an imaginative flash. As you know, ideas can visit you not only
when you are taking a shower. The bright light of the morning did not
kill the idea – just in the contrary – imbedded it in my mind.
Its seed started to grow, expanding in shape and size – a
multifunctional tool, designed to open “everything” - bank
accounts being an exception, obviously. I also wanted this opener to
perfectly connect the 3Fs (form, fit, function) and bring excitement,
surprise, fun and satisfaction to demanding customers. For more than
a year I felt like a pregnant man, carrying the idea everywhere and
thinking about it all the time when I wasn't in the office.
On
the path of developing the idea, I held my own hand for a long time.
Hundreds of hours were spent researching patent bureaus. People are
usually happy when they find what they are looking for – I was
happy to discover that no product of a similar nature existed on the
market.
At
one point my internal ultrasound revealed that the idea deserved to
be developed. Then
I lit the lampshade on my head for another year – tweaking,
removing, adding and changing. Then I
started with the drawings as they had to be accurate, showing
measurements and shape of the “guts”. After
that I spent another few weeks writing the abstract: how the elements
of the invention work together.
Then
I spent another month reviewing product marketability and variables
affecting it. Interested
to know about them? I’ll mention just a few: cost, ease of use,
ease of production, durability, novelty, ecological impact,
saleability, appearance, market size, sexy packaging, long life cycle,
disadvantages of existing products, service requirements, existing
production facilities, etc…
I
grew accustomed to working on this project almost everyday – until
one day I realized I could not change anything else. A
week passed – no further adjustments came to mind. Another
week – the device asked for no more changes. Then
it struck me! The product was born – at least on paper. I
named my gadget YOPEN - a merger between “you’ and “open”.
Here
is the website for the tool  www.yopen.ca  and here is the logo I created for it:(the)
MARKETTools,
like my creation, have the potential to serve the needs of millions
of households, food establishments, outfitters, travelers,
adventurers, people with arthritis, individuals with weak grips, etc.
The market size is impressive: for example, there are 125 million
households in both Canada and the USA, 200 million in Europe, and
billions more in Asia, Africa and Australia. In short, there is a
remarkable opportunity for a multifunctional, humouristic,
problem-solving product like my tool to help many people worldwide.

DESIGNER
My
name is Marin Darmonkow.
I
live and work in St. John's, NL, Canada. I am a creative director and
business partner in an advertising/sign/printing/web design firm
called FOCUS (www.focusbold.com).
While
I consider myself to be a curious person, my colleagues, clients,
friends, and family perceive me as wickedly creative. Many years ago,
I rented a space in my mind where I managed to conceive and develop
many ideas – some big, some small. If you have an opening in your
busy schedule and are interested in viewing my level of creativity,
please click here.
Below is a sample of my writing as well as some samples of a few
other products.1.
A
	short short story: 
I wrote it last month. My goal was to create a “webside story”
using only net lingo. The title of the tale is
One
day I was searching a portal cloud atop the Piratebay in Babylon,
when I met an androidian amazon from Nokia galaxy.
I
stumbled upon her blogspot from a far away network. She was an HD
resolution Samsung in a 3D console. We connected our platforms with
dense metatags, until we were just about to linkedin.
“Hi5
Bebo”, I uploaded my first keywords, “My name is Sony Ericsson.
I’m an imgur from Netflix.”
“Wee-Nook”,
she bounced back, viewing me through her googles. “I’m 2.0
Virgin. And I’m delicio.us open source”.
“‘I
like your definition. Digg an apple?”
“Is
it hard, or microsoft?”, she rebooted. ”I’ll reddit, but my
playstation prefers blackberry.”
“You
could be a good paypal, you know!” I subscribed, while orkutting a
slice and wordpressing it down her wikipedia.
L8R,
in a few snippets of code we streamed to the chatroom in myspace. She
wanted to tumblr on my laptop and flickr with facebook, although I
emailed all my friends to browse my tablet at home, not on social
media. While I was installing my account, she processed her username
- nerdishly, like a webcentric hacker.
“Retrieve
my password”, she displayed.
“Yo”,
I activated the server.
She
was given access to Instagram immediately, and she went there to PC.
Thinking about her vube and how to blogher made my sound card very
hot, I minimized the windows. We sat on the i-pod to touchscreen our
content. Her
software made me click the “like” button. We blogspotted
together. Our batteries were recharging and our systems seemed to be
compatible.
“Ask,
I’m the administrator,” I reset the forum.
“No,
you are just Alibaba – the netman, the dreamweaver”, she
responded online. 

“Do
you like my activation?”, I hosted wirelessly.
“Kindle”,
she 4shared. “AOL”.
Then
I msned in her bluetooth, “You got male, hotmail.”
“Are
going to nokia me down, bing me, and KMN? If yes, do you mind showing
me your hardware on Craigslist?”
“Just
don’t ask for Mac”, I upgraded, “I’ll help you develop your
app with my handset. But first, let me download in your youtube!”
“Go”,
the android phished, “Go daddy, just save the chip!”
Her
interface was glaring with emoticons. She clicked the ctrl key to
access my keyboard. The avatar on the monitor blinked, “Your
macintosh has been deleted.”
My
X-box posted the feedback, “According to this program, mails
are the ones, femails are the zeros - virtually.”
We
timblred on the motorola. She was very mobile and the algorithm was
near perfect.
“No
wikileaks, no widgets, please,” she shared, “I have no firewall!”
“GR8!”,
I noticed my bandwidth turned from dot com to unlimited.
I
started sexting in real time. The traffic was terrific and she was
roaming all over the net with her cellular.
“Type,
type, faster!”, she gigabyted  from her vimeo site.
In
a few rackspaces she started tweeting with joy, reaching pick-load
capacity. Suddenly, an adword popped up on E-bay. The message
informed us that our session was over - it was subscription based. We
both pixelated. Baidu way ppl, lol -  groupon of two sounds
pinteresting on all search engines.
Yahoo,
831!2.

A number of logos:


I have to admit – this is something I love to put my head and
hands on. In the course of my career spanning both sides of the Atlantic, I
have created numerous trademarks. Here are several most visible in the city
where I currently live and work. 


3.

Many
type fonts: 

I am showing you just one of them. You probably know that
all letterforms are pieces of art. Not only does every letter have to
be aesthetically pleasing, but typefaces must be beautiful and
legible when put together in words and sentences.4.
One
household product, 
which is currently in the manufacturing stage. It
is an extraordinarily durable, lockable and reasonably priced
mailbox. 
5.
Interior/exterior
design:
all my projects fit “minimalist approach, maximum
effect”requirements. (the)
ADVISOR
One
of my professional associates, Pascal Daireaux, who lives and works
in France, became excited about the project and gladly offered
his expertise as an Advisor. His vast professional
experience working both in government and the private sector
brings valuable perspective to the project. In addition
to Pascal's strong financial background, the project will
require his sound strategic thinking and negotiation skills.(the)
QUESTIONS 
At
least some of them you may wonder about

Why
Indiegogo?                                                           
                                                                     
            

Not
because Indiegogo has worldwide reach. Not because it is based on the
principles of opportunity and transparency. I decided to use
Indiegogo after I carefully researched the crowdsourcing market. The
web based platform was chosen as the final winner because it allows
me to choose a campaign, it allows people to pay via Paypal or credit
cards, it encourages a competition for its front page and it lets me
keep whatever is raised. Also, I like the community spirit they
managed to raise over the last few years.What
do I look like?Has
anyone besides my mother ever said nice things about the project?Several
of my closest friends. Before you, they were the only people who knew
about the project. 
Why
a flexible vs. fixed campaign? The project has several steps to complete – depending on money
raised I can successfully finish one, two, or three steps. If the
project raises much more money than its goal of $10,000, it will be
completed in its entirety.
Does
my product meet a genuine consumer need?
Market
research was conducted – the consumer interest and need exist, the
simplicity and sophistication of the product makes it salable in many
corners of the world, and the market for this type of consumer
product is big.If
this product addresses a need and performs well, what will be its
price?The
retail price of the tool will be in the mom-and-pop convenient range
of $25.99-$35.99. 

What
are my further plans in developing the opener?The
product will be licensed to a well-established firm with a good track
record and existing distribution channels. 

Will
$10,000.00 be sufficient to move the product development one step
ahead?If
successful in raising the amount on indiegogo.com, this will cover
the legal fees related to the patent application. Any excess will be
used towards the next few steps – creating and testing prototypes,
registering the trademark and signing a license agreement. 
$10,000.00
will be my bottom line, as running out of gas part way across the
desert could lead to unnecessary delays. 

Do
I have a good team of people to help see threats and opportunities
lying ahead? 
Every
team is nothing but an extension of the project. Being “in the
bottle” does not give me the opportunity to read the label, so I
selected a diverse group of individuals as my first line of
supporters and critics. They possess various skills, occupations,
tastes and connections. 

Do
I have a timeline for completing the project? 
Here
it is:How
much did the project cost so far?With
the exception of $125 USD for the provisional patent application and
$15 for registering the domain name www.yopen.ca, this project cost
me no money – all the research, product development, writing,
drawings, rendering and even the video for indiegogo.com was created
by me. 

What
will be the key success factors for the project?I'll
do my best to make the gadget a success story – largely based on
its uniqueness, novelty, superiority, fun, and price.
How
do I plan to spend the money raised? 
If
$10,000.00 is raised they’ll be used to pay a patent lawyer – to
create the claims for the tool. If more than $10,000.00 is raised, it
will be spent on further product development – even finishing it in
its entirety.
Are
there going to be additional rewards for the indiegogo contributors?Yes,
all people investing more than $50 on the project will receive an
opener with an engraved handle, shipped to them after the project
passes its manufacturing stage and the tool becomes available for
distribution. Please be patient – this will take time, therefore it
will be like an unexpected surprise in the future.If
you can’t donate, how else can you help? If
you are not ready to pledge money, please pledge your support: share
the word of my campaign - if you like the project. Share the drive
via Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram, Reddit and good old
fashioned email. Share it often - once a week or so. This helps a lot
because every time someone visits my indiegogo page, comments or
shares it, the campaign keeps trending. 
How
do you plan to deliver the perks? All
perks (with the exception of the real product - which will be
distributed when manufactured), will be delivered within a month of
contribution received - a link will be sent to the same email address
the contribution was made from, and regardless of whether or not the
project reaches its funding target. This is how I would like to say
THANK YOU to all the people who reached across oceans and borders to
give me a hand.(the) PERKS










So
far my idea presentation was successful before the jury of the brain.


It
is time to be reviewed by you – the powerful and unknown friend and
collaborator.
I
know the idea possesses strong competitive features and innovative
appeal to gain recognition in the marketplace. When on the market,
the tool will help many people solve a simple problem rather
effortlessly. Everyday.
That’s
why your support is of great importance. If you are not able to help
financially, but you like my assignment, please contribute by sending
a link to your friends. 

This
project is also your project – help make it happen.

<h3>So where are we with development and what do we need the funding for?</h3>
Hopefully as you can see from what you have read so far, we have the finished design, we have bench tested basic prototypes and are now ready to move forward with pre production before signing off for mass production. </div>
<div>I say mass, but in choosing the components for the system we are artificially limited by supply by the selected companies, which is one reason why no one large consumer electronics manufacture can compete - there just isn't enough of the OLED displays available in the market yet and what is available we have secured under contract with Japan.</div>
<div>So we are almost there and with your belief and funding we will bring to you and eventually the market (when component supplies exist) possibly the worlds most advanced '4D' 4K action camera system. </div>
<div>Thank you for your interest and for reading this, it is much appreciated.</div>
<div>Please contribute now.</div>
<div>All perks will be available at retail prices after the campaign ends for <b>30% extra.</b>
</div>
<div>
<b>3D SNAP</b> will be available for <b>£549.00 on a first come first sold basis. Limited quantities available according to supply of rare components.</b>

</div></div>","What is the 3D SNAP™? 3D SNAP ™ has been designed by the innovative German design company Atomare, to be a wearable, go anywhere, water resistant (1500M), 35,000ft unpressurised (Airborne), fully wireless 4K '4D' action camera Array.Wireless camera arrays are based around a similar principle to Pelican Imaging's Pi Cam Array concept (please see PI's video below) with the exception that ours consist of 4.6K individual laser etched photonic tubes, surrounded by DFB Quantum Casade lasers thereby enabling the capture of still images and video in 3D, through up to '4K' in almost total darkness and even under water.There is a PERK option to purchase additional phased wireless lens arrays.Whether you are an extreme sports person, skier, mountain biker, horse rider, white water rafter, canoeist, mountain climber, skateboarder, parachutist, athlete,windsurfer, scuba diver, life-logger or techie, whatever your activity (s) 3D SNAP™ has been designed for you3D SNAP™ has been designed to empower you. No longer do you have to focus, point and shoot - the onboard sensors (lasers and inertial movement - 9 degrees of freedom 3x Gyroscope, 3x Magnetometer, 3x Accelerometer & Barometric Pressure Sensor) automatically record your motion and direction and start recording with the press of one oversized button - the only button there is! Simple.You simply secure  3D SNAP™ on your hand between your fingers, or alternatively use any of the revolutionary nano suction securing (multi use) mechanisms supplied. To put it simply - so long as you have a clear patch of clothing, skin, helmet etc then you can mount the camera lens array there.No glue, no complicated fixing mechanisms - just press, twist and go!If you have opted to purchase additional 4K '4D' wireless lens arrays (up to a system maximum of 4 in total), then carefully place the additional wireless lens arrays anywhere on your body or equipment.And very powerful.Taking a leaf out of NASA's book 3D SNAP™ will use a 32-bit RTOS ( (µC/OS-III) Micrium platform, NASA's choice for the SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) on the Rover Curiosity.The 3D SNAP™ App will come in iOS, Windows and Android versions - tablet and mobile handset.The 3D SNAP™ uses Cota™ wireless charging that can recharge both the 4K '4D' SNAP™ Camera System as well as up to 4 additional wireless lens arrays concurrently - whilst in use or switched off for recharging up to 30ft away all without any wires whatsoever - truly wireless!Each 3D SNAP™ Camera System comes with 512GB built-in '3D' memory and each associated wireless lens array will come with 512GB '3D' Memory (enough storage for a day’s worth of movies and high-speed photography. Capture 60Mbps video , for example, and you could theoretically keep going for almost 19 hours so there is little chance of you avoiding losing that split second fantastic action shot!
Specifications

The System
In its simplest form the 3D SNAP™ system consists of a Lens Array, a touch sensitive flexible high definition OLED display and an Main Control Unit all secured on a total 3 direction flexible memory clear polymer band.


High-tech ceramic Lens Array CaseA blend of zirconium and yttrium oxides subjected to high pressure at a temperature in excess of 2000°C, this high-tech ceramic is then ground using special diamond crystal tipped tools to shape the removeable phased Array lens case. It features a titanium cage with bevelled, drawn, polished and ruthenium-coated edges. providing for peerless resistance and stability for anything that your sport can throw at it!
Lens ArrayIn an insect, each ommatidium (Small Eye) in the compound eye has a corneal lens, a crystalline cone and a light-sensitive organ at its base. The ommatidia work in unison to build a picture of the world.Our Ommatidium - small Eyes Consists of 4.6K individual laser etched photonic tubes, each with its own lens at one end and a photodetector at the other, providing for a true 160 degrees field of view.This whole arrangement is engineered to a hemispherical shape to give a 160-degree field of vision and surrounded by DFB Quantum Casade lasers. The benefit of this arrangement is that they show remarkable depth of field - they can focus on objects at different distances at the same time and space, enabling the capture of still images and video in 3D, through up to '4K' in almost total darkness and even under water (1500M certified).They also do not suffer from the aberrations seen in single lens systems when viewing off-axis objects such as the huge distortion observed in wide-angle camera lenses such as the fish-eye.

Main Control Unit (MCU)
The main control unit consist of a flexible polymer casing complete with a high definition flexible touchscreen (with gloved fingers) OLED Display (you see what the cameras see), a '3D' flexible battery, 512GB built in '3D' memory, the main processing unit and associated electronics.

Control Button and dial
There is only one button and simple rotary dial allowing users to quickly setup the 3D SNAP™,or alternatively using the software App on your phone/tablet

When rotated the dial brings up simple graphics on the flexible OLED display which with a single touch makes the required settings for you. 
Alternatively, users can switch to Auto and let the system chose the optimum settings for you.
The rotary dial and button are made from the same materials as the lens case thereby ensuring strength and reliability no matter what you throw at it!Connectivity

3D SNAP™ comes as standard supporting WiFi 802.11 ac MIMO and  802.15.6NB1
(MBAN). with Bluetooth Smart Low Energy for handset/tablet setup.



Location Awareness

3D SNAP™ comes as standard with a choice of GPS/Galileo/Glonass/Compass(BeiDou
2)/QZSS) support in addition to using MBAN and the 9 degree freedom inertial unit for local extra phased camera Array positioning if specified.


Battery Life

3D SNAP™ once fully charged using the Cota wireless charging system the unit will operate for approximately 5 hours recording at 4K '4D' 30fps (Cascade Lasers on). The system has a built in wireless quick charge facility that charges the units fully in 30 mins.

If you decide to purchase the optional Cota battery pack then you can wirelessly charge your devices continually giving you up to 19 hours of record time.

Additional Information
Frame rates: Variable from 4K 30fps down to standard HD 60fps (1080p). 
Slow motion 240fps
Point and shoot for stills frequency 1 - 1/20K of a second - Auto on.

So what can you do with the software?
Rather than explain the endless possibilities please see the video below (Courtesy of Pelican Imaging and You Tube!






So where are we with development and what do we need the funding for?
Hopefully as you can see from what you have read so far, we have the finished design, we have bench tested basic prototypes and are now ready to move forward with pre production before signing off for mass production. 
I say mass, but in choosing the components for the system we are artificially limited by supply by the selected companies, which is one reason why no one large consumer electronics manufacture can compete - there just isn't enough of the OLED displays available in the market yet and what is available we have secured under contract with Japan.
So we are almost there and with your belief and funding we will bring to you and eventually the market (when component supplies exist) possibly the worlds most advanced '4D' 4K action camera system. 
Thank you for your interest and for reading this, it is much appreciated.
Please contribute now.
All perks will be available at retail prices after the campaign ends for 30% extra.


3D SNAP will be available for £549.00 on a first come first sold basis. Limited quantities available according to supply of rare components.

<h2>The world's first truly multi touch device for iMac.</h2>
<h3>Designed for You.</h3>
<div>We love iMac, we love technology and we love the ease and functionality of the iPhone and iPad. We have often wondered why the iMac has remained non-touch given the extensive development Apple has done in the touch screen realm. So, we have developed a unique and convenient way to convert a standard iMac into a fully functional multi touch screen computer. <br/><br/> As innovative as it is functional the C2T will transform the way you not only use your iMac but it will enhance the way you use it. Using a glass free design coupled with our unique and patented ""beam collation algorithm"" technology the C2T has reinvented the iMac and how you will use it in the future.<br/><br/>
</div>
<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://convert2touch.com/images/01.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>We have spent over $250,000 in the development phase of this project and have successfully completed testing on the original 21"" iMac. We have completed a production run to prove the technology and the usability of the design.<br/><br/> We now need to move to the next phase of this project, which is tooling for the set up of full production of C2T for all 21"" and 27"" iMac's. Our investment in R&amp;D and field-testing has been extensive so we know that the design and technology is sound.<br/><br/> By backing this project you will enable us to bring our dream of a world with multi touch iMacs to reality. You will become a part of something great as we change the world of iMac and how you see and use them.<br/><br/>
</div>
<h3>We Need You</h3>
<div>Without your help we would need to sell C2T through our existing supply channels. This means it will :<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Be sold at considerably higher price,</li>
<li>At a much later time,</li>
<li>With much less features, and</li>
<li>No customisation possibilities.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/> By backing us now, you will become an active member of our development team, and help us realise the full potential of this great product concept.<br/><br/>
</div>
<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://convert2touch.com/images/02.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<div>As a backer of this project you will be at the cutting edge of the iMac touch revolution. You will receive your very own C2T from our first full production run. <br/><br/>
</div>
<h3>What do I get?</h3>
<div>By being a part of our early bird offer you will receive a minimum of $100 discount on the RRP. We will include a limited edition customised 'The iMac, Reinvented' Touch Pen and a Screen protector for your iMac. <br/><br/> If you are a Designer or Educator you can save up to $1000 on the RRP by supporting us in this critical phase of development.</div>
<br/><br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://convert2touch.com/images/Perks-List.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><h3>So, where are we now?</h3>
<div>The platform and the industrial design are fully complete and we have the first production samples already in our office. Now we need your help to finish the development, buy tooling and expand our manufacturing capabilities.</div>
<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://convert2touch.com/images/C2T-Timeline.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>Where will your funding go?</h3>
<div>We have already invested heavily in the development of this project. Your funding is the critical link to the completion of this project and will be used to realise our dream of the world's first full multi touch device for iMac.</div>
<h3>Use of Funds</h3>
<div>We have working prototypes and a supply chain that's ready to go. We need your help to take the next step. <br/><br/> We see the following funding milestones: We will use the first $100,000 raised through the campaign to buy tooling and enhance our existing manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China. This will enable us to increase our cost-efficient manufacturing of the frame enclosure, which requires expensive die cast, and mould tooling. Then there are additional moulds required for the internal sections, components, connectors and cabling and all of these parts add up quickly.<br/><br/> We love the idea of letting you design the look. If we reach $250,000 we will give every backer the option to change the colour of their C2T. <br/><br/> Get us to $500,000 and we will give everyone free shipping.*<br/><br/> At $750,000 we will upgrade every backer to an extended 3 year warranty, up from the standard 1 year.*<br/><br/> At the goal of $1,000,000 we will we able to purchase some of the specialized machinery, equipment and hire additional staff required to customize some design of C2T to your personal preference.<br/><br/> Backers must have chosen a perk with a value of $229 or higher.</div>
<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://convert2touch.com/images/Use-of-Funds.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>Your contribution</h3>
<div>We have put a lot of effort into this project but like many things in life not everything can be completed by just a few. You and your contribution will enable us to reach our goal. You will not only be a part of a world first but you will be one of the first to be using C2T LIVE!<br/><br/> As we have already proven the technology with our C2T device for the pre 2012, 21"" iMac we know the design and concept is sound. All functionality has been tested through numerous software enhancements within the firmware which you will be able to continually update online simply should it ever be required.</div>
<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://convert2touch.com/images/03.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>Why Trust Convert 2 Touch</h3>
<div>Convert 2 Touch has more than 25 years experience with Apple products. We have been there from the start and worked with virtually every model and design Apple have produced. It was a natural progression to move our business into this area as 'we love mac'. Today, it is rare to be able to design something for a product, which can totally reinvent an already amazing product like the iMac, but here we are.</div>
<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://convert2touch.com/images/05.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>Give the gift of crowdfunding!</h3>
<div>The participation in creating C2T is a great gift to give for any occasion. We have many perks at all price levels. All of them have one thing in common: they let you (or your loved one) participate in the greatest innovation since Apple invented the iMac! Here is a quick summary of our coolest perks:</div>
<h3>We ship to 220 countries world-wide!</h3>
<div>Your new C2T will be shipped via EMS with full online tracking and insurance to your specified postal address.</div>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<h3>What is C2T?</h3>
<div>C2T is a unique device that converts a standard iMac 21"" or 27"" into a fully functional touch screen computer which allows you to use your iMac as if it were an iPhone or iPad.</div>
<h3>How does C2T work?</h3>
<div>C2T utilizes infrared technology overlaid across the screen to enable you to control the functions of the iMac by touch. Using a glass free design coupled with our unique and patented ""beam collation algorithm"" technology the C2T has reinvented the iMac and how you will use it in the future.</div>
<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://convert2touch.com/images/06.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>How does C2T connect?</h3>
<div>C2T connects via USB.</div>
<h3>Do I need additional software or drivers?</h3>
<div>No. C2T is PNP (Plug &amp; Play) so it requires no additional software or drivers. Simply plug in the USB wait 10 seconds and your iMac will be touch enabled.</div>
<h3>Will C2T damage my iMac or leave any marks?</h3>
<div>No. C2T will not damage or mark your iMac and is easily applied and or removed. It attaches to your iMac with discretely placed magnets within the frame.</div>
<h3>Will my keyboard and mouse still function?</h3>
<div>Yes. Once you have connected the C2T to your iMac you will still have the full functionality of your keyboard and mouse. They may however become a little jealous of your new device.</div>
<h3>Will C2T work if my iMac is using Windows?</h3>
<div>Yes. C2T has been designed to work with either Mac OS or Windows.</div>
<h3>What operating systems can be used with C2T?</h3>
<div>Mac OS<br/> Windows</div>
<h3>Design</h3>
<div>C2T is built out of the finest aluminium and poly materials. If we reach critical mass we can customise your C2T to your favorite colour or pattern. The C2T is hand made in our own modest facility Shenzhen, China.</div>
<h3>How far are you in the development of C2T?</h3>
<div>The platform and the industrial design are fully complete and we have the first production samples already in our office. Now we need your help to finish the development, buy tooling and expand our manufacturing capabilities.</div>
<h3>How can you be sure the technology will work?</h3>
<div>C2T is already fully complete and is already available for the original 21"" iMac. We have spent more than $250,000 developing the design, technology and sample production. <br/><br/> We now need your help with the costs associated with moving forward into the full production of the original 27"" and the new 21"" &amp; 27"" models.</div>
<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
<div>We do not see any risks at all as we have a proven design and working product already completed. We also hold patents for this design internationally.<br/><br/> However, with all technology there are always risks, in this case we believe we have identified all possibilities for issues and are in a position where the only delay is lack of the available funding to complete the project.</div>
<h3>What else can you do to help?</h3>
<div>We know it is not always possible to contribute funds, but you can help us considerably if you can forward this link to your network via Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit or any other social media outlet.<br/><br/> We thank you so much for your support.</div>
<h3>I have more questions. Who do I ask?</h3>

This will enable us to increase our cost-efficient manufacturing of the frame enclosure, which requires expensive die cast, and mould tooling. Then there are additional moulds required for the internal sections, components, connectors and cabling and all of these parts add up quickly. We love the idea of letting you design the look. If we reach $250,000 we will give every backer the option to change the colour of their C2T.  Get us to $500,000 and we will give everyone free shipping.* At $750,000 we will upgrade every backer to an extended 3 year warranty, up from the standard 1 year.* At the goal of $1,000,000 we will we able to purchase some of the specialized machinery, equipment and hire additional staff required to customize some design of C2T to your personal preference. Backers must have chosen a perk with a value of $229 or higher.
Your contribution
We have put a lot of effort into this project but like many things in life not everything can be completed by just a few. You and your contribution will enable us to reach our goal. You will not only be a part of a world first but you will be one of the first to be using C2T LIVE! As we have already proven the technology with our C2T device for the pre 2012, 21"" iMac we know the design and concept is sound. All functionality has been tested through numerous software enhancements within the firmware which you will be able to continually update online simply should it ever be required.
Why Trust Convert 2 Touch
Convert 2 Touch has more than 25 years experience with Apple products. We have been there from the start and worked with virtually every model and design Apple have produced. It was a natural progression to move our business into this area as 'we love mac'. Today, it is rare to be able to design something for a product, which can totally reinvent an already amazing product like the iMac, but here we are.
Give the gift of crowdfunding!
The participation in creating C2T is a great gift to give for any occasion. We have many perks at all price levels. All of them have one thing in common: they let you (or your loved one) participate in the greatest innovation since Apple invented the iMac! Here is a quick summary of our coolest perks:
We ship to 220 countries world-wide!
Your new C2T will be shipped via EMS with full online tracking and insurance to your specified postal address.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is C2T?
C2T is a unique device that converts a standard iMac 21"" or 27"" into a fully functional touch screen computer which allows you to use your iMac as if it were an iPhone or iPad.
How does C2T work?
C2T utilizes infrared technology overlaid across the screen to enable you to control the functions of the iMac by touch. Using a glass free design coupled with our unique and patented ""beam collation algorithm"" technology the C2T has reinvented the iMac and how you will use it in the future.
How does C2T connect?
C2T connects via USB.
Do I need additional software or drivers?
No. C2T is PNP (Plug & Play) so it requires no additional software or drivers. Simply plug in the USB wait 10 seconds and your iMac will be touch enabled.
Will C2T damage my iMac or leave any marks?
No. C2T will not damage or mark your iMac and is easily applied and or removed. It attaches to your iMac with discretely placed magnets within the frame.
Will my keyboard and mouse still function?
Yes. Once you have connected the C2T to your iMac you will still have the full functionality of your keyboard and mouse. They may however become a little jealous of your new device.
Will C2T work if my iMac is using Windows?
Yes. C2T has been designed to work with either Mac OS or Windows.
What operating systems can be used with C2T?
Mac OS Windows
Design
C2T is built out of the finest aluminium and poly materials. If we reach critical mass we can customise your C2T to your favorite colour or pattern. The C2T is hand made in our own modest facility Shenzhen, China.
How far are you in the development of C2T?
The platform and the industrial design are fully complete and we have the first production samples already in our office. Now we need your help to finish the development, buy tooling and expand our manufacturing capabilities.
How can you be sure the technology will work?
C2T is already fully complete and is already available for the original 21"" iMac. We have spent more than $250,000 developing the design, technology and sample production.  We now need your help with the costs associated with moving forward into the full production of the original 27"" and the new 21"" & 27"" models.
What are the risks?
We do not see any risks at all as we have a proven design and working product already completed. We also hold patents for this design internationally. However, with all technology there are always risks, in this case we believe we have identified all possibilities for issues and are in a position where the only delay is lack of the available funding to complete the project.
What else can you do to help?
We know it is not always possible to contribute funds, but you can help us considerably if you can forward this link to your network via Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit or any other social media outlet. We thank you so much for your support.
I have more questions. Who do I ask?

<p> </p>
<p>The Cosmo Communicator also comes fully equipped with a great 24MP camera. To take a selfie or for a quick snap, you can operate the camera, zoom and flash without opening the clamshell.</p>

<p>Cosmo’s innovative toggle switch provides superior security for the device with an integrated fingerprint sensor and call answer buttons, so you can avoid accepting calls accidentally when the device is in your pocket or handbag.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Cosmo is based on the powerful Mediatek P70 8-core processor plus separate GPU and AI processors. It has a massive 6GBs of RAM and 128 GBs of Flash memory - ample storage for today's power users. It also offers microSD expansion for storage memory.</p>

The Planet Story continues...
At Planet Computers innovation is at the heart of our company.  Earlier this year,  we successfully delivered our Gemini PDA product to more than 7000 Indiegogo backers who supported our mission to kick start a new mobile computing revolution. 
Now, we are ready to push our vision even further and you can be part of it.
In the process of developing our new device we asked our Indiegogo backers, users and followers what features they wanted to have.
We are excited to announce that we are extending the range of Planet devices with the Cosmo Communicator, our new flagship device.
The Cosmo Communicator is a modern dual-screen clamshell-based mobile communicator with an integrated keyboard. It is built to be a great pocket computer, a superb mobile phone and an excellent high resolution camera.

The Cosmo features dual colour displays: it features an external colour touchscreen display for easy phone call control and notifications.  Tucked away inside the beautiful and sleek award winning clamshell design is an ultra-wide 6” colour touchscreen display providing ample space to create on the move with a fully functioning  keyboard integrated into the device. When open, the innovative clamshell also acts as a support of the device, allowing you to type comfortably.

Cosmo’s newly designed backlit keyboard, allows you to comfortably work at night or in dark spaces such as on long plane journeys without the need of external lighting.
 

 
The Cosmo Communicator also comes fully equipped with a great 24MP camera. To take a selfie or for a quick snap, you can operate the camera, zoom and flash without opening the clamshell.
We have selected a great world-wide 4G LTE phone modem to make the Cosmo a truly amazing phone, fast enough to be able to handle dual 4G SIM connections, for both phone calls and data. It also features Bluetooth, NFC and Wi-Fi communications.
Cosmo’s innovative toggle switch provides superior security for the device with an integrated fingerprint sensor and call answer buttons, so you can avoid accepting calls accidentally when the device is in your pocket or handbag.
 
The Cosmo is based on the powerful Mediatek P70 8-core processor plus separate GPU and AI processors. It has a massive 6GBs of RAM and 128 GBs of Flash memory - ample storage for today's power users. It also offers microSD expansion for storage memory.
Cosmo’s large 4220 mAh battery provides enough power for all day and even two day usage.
Cosmo allows you to work in restricted spaces comfortably, on planes, on trains, in coffee bars. You can also hold the Cosmo and use it with ease standing up or on the bus.
It's the only device you need to carry - and small enough to fit in your pocket.
It’s a true all-in-one replacement for both your mobile phone and your laptop.
We hope that you like our new device and that you can help us make it a reality.

<h3>Our Story<br/>
</h3>
<div>One common complaint about the Fire is that it lacks the Collections feature of the other Kindles, which allows users to organize books into folders. We all love reading, and we need this feature on the Fire to help us keep track of our books! So we're going to take matters into our own hands and develop an app for the Kindle Fire that accomplishes this. But we can't do it alone.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We've got app development teams standing by to make this app a reality. They'll design it especially for the Fire, and it should even have a few more options than just what's on the original Kindle collections. We're hoping for something beautiful with background images of dusty bookshelves and cozy libraries to help get us in the mood for reading as we create our collections.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We roughly estimate that it'll take a month to develop, once we've reached our funding goal. The app will eventually make it into the Amazon Appstore, but everyone who contributes to this campaign will get a complimentary copy! </div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're hoping to bring one of the most-beloved features of the Kindle to the Kindle Fire, and it's no exaggeration to say that this is something everyone will want to have. You'll be able to create your own collections and hopefully access your books straight from this app. What are the consequences if this campaign doesn't happen? Well, we'll all just have to continue scrolling through our entire list of books to find the one we want without being able to bunch them together in ways that make sense. But let's show that we've got what it takes to find a solution for this!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>We need to raise $5,000 to make this happen. It sounds like a lot, but that's only $10 from 500 people or $50 from 100 people. With all of the Kindle Fire lovers we have around here, we can easily make that happen. But if we don't there's no risk you for because all of the money will be refunded.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The vast majority of the money goes to the app developer, then there's a small amount left over for artwork and support if it's needed. IndieGoGo and Paypal take a percentage for allowing us to do this as well. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Here's what you get for contributing!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Everyone who pitches in $10 gets a copy of the app when it's finished.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Everyone who pitches in $25 gets a copy of the app and a copy of our Tips &amp; Tricks Guide, The Kindle Fire Department Compendium.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Everyone who pitches in $50 gets the app, the guide, and the chance to beta-test the app and give us feedback. If you've never beta-tested an app, it can be exciting to be so closely involved in the development process. It's definitely worth it!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Everyone who pitches in $100 will get the app, the guide, the beta-testing spot, and a special Thank You on our site when the app finally gets released. This is your chance to be a Kindle Fire Department Hero!</div>

<h3><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h3>
</div><div><p>Once you've contributed, the most important thing you can do to make sure this app gets into your hands is to make sure other Kindle Fire owners are involved!

<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">FAQs</span></h2>
<div>
<b>Q: When will I receive my FiiV case?</b><p>A: Our current ETA is May 2015, and we'll continue to communicate schedule updates to our pre-order customers via email.</p>
<b>Q: Why a smart case?</b><p>A: There are a lot of ways to 'stay connected' - from finding your local Starbucks and enjoying a coffee to buying a table top Mi-Fi unit to buying a cellular tablet. But there are limitations. We created FiiV so that you can control when and how you connect. Once you pair your FiiV case to your tablet, enjoy connectivity on your terms and an adequate power bank to get you through those rough days.</p>
<b>Q: Is this a viable method to sustain my privacy?</b><p>A: Privacy is a hot topic for any 'connected' technology product, and here's our take. We purposefully designed FiiV so that it's completely controllable by the user. There are several options in terms of security settings that you control to keep your personal information safe.</p>
<b>Q: Why do I need a case to be functional on multiple GSM networks?</b><p>A: We feel this is the right design path to take given the varying data rates and terms from carrier to carrier. We want the user to remain in the driver seat. Other solutions lock you in to any 1 carrier without recourse. With FiiV, you can switch at any time. This also works great for those who travel abroad; Avoid those roaming data charges. FiiV helps you focus on what is important- enjoying your travels and sharing it with the folks back home.</p>
<b>Q: How do I get a SIM card once I choose to switch carriers?</b><p>A: After you have exhausted all of your purchased data on one wireless carrier, simply visit a retail location for your preferred choice and request to open a data account. Stay clear of contracts and get the data connectivity you want and need, any time. </p>
<b>Q: Is the FiiV case compatible with any tablet? </b><p>A: Initial FiiV tablet models will be compatible with iPad Air (1st Generation) and iPad Mini (all generations). We fully intend to introduce Android compatible FiiV models very soon.</p>

FiiV TECHNICAL SPECS










FAQs

Q: When will I receive my FiiV case?A: Our current ETA is May 2015, and we'll continue to communicate schedule updates to our pre-order customers via email.
Q: Why a smart case?A: There are a lot of ways to 'stay connected' - from finding your local Starbucks and enjoying a coffee to buying a table top Mi-Fi unit to buying a cellular tablet. But there are limitations. We created FiiV so that you can control when and how you connect. Once you pair your FiiV case to your tablet, enjoy connectivity on your terms and an adequate power bank to get you through those rough days.
Q: Is this a viable method to sustain my privacy?A: Privacy is a hot topic for any 'connected' technology product, and here's our take. We purposefully designed FiiV so that it's completely controllable by the user. There are several options in terms of security settings that you control to keep your personal information safe.
Q: Why do I need a case to be functional on multiple GSM networks?A: We feel this is the right design path to take given the varying data rates and terms from carrier to carrier. We want the user to remain in the driver seat. Other solutions lock you in to any 1 carrier without recourse. With FiiV, you can switch at any time. This also works great for those who travel abroad; Avoid those roaming data charges. FiiV helps you focus on what is important- enjoying your travels and sharing it with the folks back home.
Q: How do I get a SIM card once I choose to switch carriers?A: After you have exhausted all of your purchased data on one wireless carrier, simply visit a retail location for your preferred choice and request to open a data account. Stay clear of contracts and get the data connectivity you want and need, any time. 
Q: Is the FiiV case compatible with any tablet? A: Initial FiiV tablet models will be compatible with iPad Air (1st Generation) and iPad Mini (all generations). We fully intend to introduce Android compatible FiiV models very soon.

Do not over bend or fold the card Redcards are also flexible and recover their original condition quickly, but if one over bend the card to a certain point, the Redcards will not be able to recover its bent sides.

But it's almost invisible and will not have any impact on its efficiency. In some cases, however, please contact us to request an exchange if the scratches are very serious.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div> <p></p>
</div>
<p>A project of this magnitude always contains risks. There are naturally areas of the software, in particular, which are still under development, and others which currently lack polish. Members of the Solu team have, however, delivered multiple hardware and software projects for a variety of companies ranging from large enterprises to startups. The progress of Solu has been extremely swift.</p>
<p>To minimize delays in delivery, we have completed a lion’s share of the work before launching our campaign on Kickstarter. We have been developing and testing the software for almost a year. We have built a number series of prototypes for the hardware, and have partnered with established hardware engineers to build the device. We have signed a contract with our manufacturing partner, and placed orders for several of the parts with long lead times.</p>

For a fixed monthly fee of $20, you get all the storage and apps you need, without annoying in-app purchases, freemium options or advertisements. We are also helping developers to make a living out of their apps by sharing a fair portion of the monthly fee with them.




  Developer rewards are allocated based on exact user data. Our algorithm takes various factors into account: the number of users, the frequency of use, the length of each use and its overall usefulness. 
We are working with a number of development houses to bring their collaborative tools to Solu, but we also support legacy Android apps.
Made in Finland

Finland is best known for its technological innovation. It is the country that led the mobile revolution, where Linux was created and where databases were refined with MySQL. It is the home to some of the world’s leading gaming companies including Rovio and Supercell.
Solu was was inspired by the nature and skills of the Nordic people. Not only was Solu invented in Finland but it is also designed, built, tested and packaged there. When you buy a Solu you know you are getting something built in a place with very low levels of corruption, and high standards of working conditions. 

Our valuesSolu is not merely a company, it is a team of a 13 people, driven by a common goal. You can learn more about us on our web site.
    
Our core values and beliefs are the driving force behind everything we do:
We subscribe to and believe in innovation through every level of Solu and its activities. We are happy to stand out, challenge the status quo, and have pride in what we do.

Risks and Challenges
 

A project of this magnitude always contains risks. There are naturally areas of the software, in particular, which are still under development, and others which currently lack polish. Members of the Solu team have, however, delivered multiple hardware and software projects for a variety of companies ranging from large enterprises to startups. The progress of Solu has been extremely swift.
To minimize delays in delivery, we have completed a lion’s share of the work before launching our campaign on Kickstarter. We have been developing and testing the software for almost a year. We have built a number series of prototypes for the hardware, and have partnered with established hardware engineers to build the device. We have signed a contract with our manufacturing partner, and placed orders for several of the parts with long lead times.",14.0,4,"1 Campaign

That’s why we created GINA, the first complete smart coffee brewing instrument.     With a built-in Bluetooth SCALE weighing your ingredients will become easier, allowing you to find the perfect ratio between coffee, water and time.  Your phone will connect GINA with an APP via Bluetooth to transfer and save all of your brewing data and see what the rest of coffee loving community is sharing.With specially designed VALVE you can even tune your GINA and play with 3 different brewing techniques. Leave it open for pour-over, close it for immersion brew or set the drop flow for cold drip.  We combined all the features from the tools you already know into one complete device. All of your manual coffee brewing techniques are now featured in one. This means better use of your kitchen space and less hassle prepping all your coffee brewing tools.  Pour hot water over coffee grounds while leaving the valve open and observe the elegant flow - for the purest taste and highlighted qualities of the bean.  Soak coffee grounds in the ceramic funnel, open the valve and extract the brewing - for the sharpest taste and a richer beverage body.   Put grounds into the inner glass pitcher and pour cold water into the funnel. Set the drop flow and let it drip - for the sweetest taste and smoothest beverage body.

<p>AppYourCar‘s Wireless Bluetooth Controller is designed to integrate perfectly with your steering wheel and its patent pending technology gives you the same unrestricted access to your smartphone as if you would use your phones touchscreen by hand.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1031428/files/20141120005222-02_-_Controller_-_01_-_01.jpg?1416473542"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>AppYourCar is for reading, browsing and selecting data from all kinds of apps which improve your driving experience. It is neither a keyboard, nor a gamepad.
Just use the thumb joystick to navigate and control your apps and you will be amazed how much your smartphone has to offer you this way!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1007818/files/20141112035428-line.png?1415793268"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We worked really hard on minimizing the number of buttons on the controller. In doing so, we created the most effective, yet simplest way to control your phone with just your thumb and fingers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1071011/files/20141204081655-Controller_-_02_-_Android_-_small.jpg?1417709815"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>On the back of the Android controller you will find the 'quick navigation' buttons. They will bring you back to the corresponding category in our Innovative Mobile App - no matter which other app you're using at that moment.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1071013/files/20141204081705-Controller_-_02_-_iOS_-_small.jpg?1417709825"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>On the back of the iOS controller you will find the buttons to do a swiping action on your phone's screen. The VoiceOver button tells your phone to read any selected text or message out loud.</p>
<p>On the front of both controller versions you will find the main controls for browsing and selecting apps or menu entries, list entries or other data inside an app.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1007819/files/20141112035444-line.png?1415793284"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>AppYourCar was designed with safety in mind. The Controller sits snugly on your steering wheel. 
That way you can keep control of your vehicle at any given moment. The Controller will fit on almost any steering wheel. 
Just mount it onto yours in the way it fits your driving style best.</p>
<p>Also, life is grey enough, let's put some color in! Just choose a color which works best for your car:</p>

<p>Less cables, less hassle!</p>
<p>We are using the newest charging technology available right now: Wireless Charging. If your phone supports wireless charging you will never have to bother with any cables again.</p>
<p>And if it doesn't? Just plug the usb cable into the mounting, then into your phone and you'll never run out of juice again!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1007822/files/20141112035455-line.png?1415793295"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Wireless and wired charging, a bluetooth hands-free connection, audio and music streaming: Our Dashboard Mounting does it all.</p>
<p>And aren't you sick of all those cables running and hanging around in the interior of your car? The only cables you need are plugged into the back of our mounting.

<p>The idea for AppYourCar was born a little bit over a year ago. Since then we have worked tirelessly to improve upon the idea continuously. 
During this time our team grew and the idea evolved from being a fun and smart gadget we wanted for ourselves to a product you will want for your car as well.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1021545/files/20141117012118-Status.jpg?1416216078"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We experimented with several different prototypes and software architectures to find the best solution for controlling a smartphone.<br/>

<p></p>
<p>We now have a fully functional and finished prototype. We also have a manufacturer lined up with massive experience and countless global customers. 
That way we make sure that not only you will get your AppYourCar system on time, but also that it‘s the highest quality product we could possibly make.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1007819/files/20141112035444-line.png?1415793284"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>But we need your help to bring AppYourCar to market. Only together we can make this vision become reality: A Way to Use Your Smartphone Apps in Your Car!</p>

<h3>PAYMENT &amp; SHIPPING</h3>
<ul>
<h4>Is shipping included?</h4>
<p>Yes! Shipping is included for all countries.</p>
<h4>Which countries do you ship to?</h4>
<p>We are shipping to all countries.</p>
<h4>Why do EU contributors need to add VAT?</h4>
<p>As a company registered in the EU we are required by law to charge VAT to EU contributors. However, if you are ordering on behalf of an European company with a valid VAT ID, you don't need to add VAT to your perk. Simply provide us with your VAT ID when we will ask you to do so by mail.</p>
<h4>I live in the EU and forgot/was unable to add VAT – what shall I do?</h4>

</ul>
<h3>SAFTEY</h3>
<ul>
<h4>Is AppYourCar legal?</h4>
<p><b>YES</b>. We did extensive research in that regard and are certain that AppYourCar is legal according to current laws and regulations. AppYourCar is basically an infotainment system like any other legal automobile on-board system: Giving you a controller, a display (= your smartphone) and a way to browse and select infotainment related data while driving.</p>
<h4>Why do you call AppYourCar an 'infotainment system' and what exactly are those?</h4>
<p>Infotainment systems are usually on-board systems consisting of different categories like communication, media and navigation. AppYourCar <b>excels</b> in those categories because your smartphone is way more <b>advanced</b> than any on-board system and has those functions down easily.</p>
<h4>Why is AppYourCar so much better than all the other (high end) infotainment systems?</h4>
<p>Your smartphone's genius shines where other infotainment systems stop: Read notifications from your social media apps, check your calendar, read short messages from any messaging service, get traffic and weather forecasts, leave voice messages to your contacts or even to yourself as a reminder service... 
<br/>AppYourCar turns your smartphone into the most <b>advanced</b> on-board system the world has ever seen. Why? Simply because your smartphone is just such an <b>amazingly</b> powerful device!</p>
<h4>But isn't it dangerous to use your smartphone extensively while driving?</h4>
<p>Yes, indeed! That is why AppYourCar does <b>NOT</b> provide you with a way to misemploy your smartphone while driving. AppYourCar was built with <b>safety</b> in mind. It gives you access and a way to browse and read important but small amounts of data when you need it.</p>
<h4>So, what <b>CAN</b> you do with AppYourCar?</h4>
<p>AppYourCar is for reading, browsing and selecting small amounts of data from all kinds of apps which improve your driving experience.
<br/>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safely choose whatever song you like to listen to from <b>all</b> the music on your smartphone.</li>
<li>Checking your calendar appointments for a time and date or an address. It's <b>no more</b> complex or complicated than scrolling through a list of radio stations.</li>
<li>Easily access voice command apps for complicated inputs like an address.</li>
<li>Use the text-to-speech function to have your phone read your short messages out loud.</li>
<li>Dictate a short message with the help of your smartphone's speech-to-text functionality.</li>
<li>... <b>and so much more</b> ... </li>
</ul>
<h4>And what exactly <b>CAN'T</b> you do with AppYourCar?</h4>
<p>The system is not designed to simply entertain or even worse distract you from driving. 
<br/>AppYourCar does <b>NOT</b> support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing an email while driving. AppYourCar has <b>no</b> keyboard or anything similar. It is built to let you read, browse and select small amounts of data only. You will be amazed how much your smartphone has to offer you this way!</li>
<li>Play a video game or something equally idiotic! AppYourCar is <b>NOT</b> a gamepad. Think of it as a small remote control for your smartphone sitting snugly on your steering wheel and giving you access to what really can improve your driving experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why is AppYourCar by far the safest 'infotainment system' on the market?
</h4>
<p>AppYourCar's system utilizes the power of your smartphone and combines it with an easy and safe way for you to use while driving.
<br/>It is <b>safe</b>, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are in <b>constant control</b> of the vehicle. You never have to take your hands of the steering wheel! The AppYourCar Controller fits perfectly on almost any steering wheel. 
You have direct control of your phone's apps with just the use of your thumb and fingers. And with its smart design, it also doesn't constrict the use of the steering wheel in any way.</li>
<li>You can keep your eyes where they belong: On the <b>road</b>. The AppYourCar Mounting can be positioned on the dashboard of your car. 
With the display of your phone sitting above the steering wheel, almost at eye level, the system is very close to the sensation of a head-up display (HUD).
At the same time your smartphone is <b>not</b> obstructing your view of the street since it is not mounted directly on to the windshield.</li>
<li>There is <b>no more</b> unnecessary distraction due to complicated and uncomfortable infotainment systems build into your car. After all, there are not many 'computer systems' you know so well as your own smartphone, are there?</li>

</ul></div>","What is AppYourCar?
AppYourCar is the first smartphone gear specifically designed to give you an easy and safe way to use your phone or tablet in your car.
Consisting of a Wireless Bluetooth Controller, a Wireless Dashboard Mounting and an Innovative Mobile App.

We set out to develop AppYourCar with one simple idea in mind: To bring all your favorite apps, on your own smartphone into your car. 
The only thing you need to have your favorite apps and all your personal data available while driving your car, is an easy and safe way to control your smartphone directly. 
AppYourCar enables you to use all your messaging or social media apps right there on your smartphone – without taking your eyes off the road or your hands off the steering wheel.



AppYourCar‘s Wireless Bluetooth Controller is designed to integrate perfectly with your steering wheel and its patent pending technology gives you the same unrestricted access to your smartphone as if you would use your phones touchscreen by hand.

AppYourCar is for reading, browsing and selecting data from all kinds of apps which improve your driving experience. It is neither a keyboard, nor a gamepad.
Just use the thumb joystick to navigate and control your apps and you will be amazed how much your smartphone has to offer you this way!

We worked really hard on minimizing the number of buttons on the controller. In doing so, we created the most effective, yet simplest way to control your phone with just your thumb and fingers.

On the back of the Android controller you will find the 'quick navigation' buttons. They will bring you back to the corresponding category in our Innovative Mobile App - no matter which other app you're using at that moment.

On the back of the iOS controller you will find the buttons to do a swiping action on your phone's screen. The VoiceOver button tells your phone to read any selected text or message out loud.
On the front of both controller versions you will find the main controls for browsing and selecting apps or menu entries, list entries or other data inside an app.


AppYourCar was designed with safety in mind. The Controller sits snugly on your steering wheel. 
That way you can keep control of your vehicle at any given moment. The Controller will fit on almost any steering wheel. 
Just mount it onto yours in the way it fits your driving style best.
Also, life is grey enough, let's put some color in! Just choose a color which works best for your car:



The Wireless Dashboard Mounting lets you keep your eyes where they belong: On the road.

With our amazing new smartphone mounting we made sure, that you get the best possible view onto your smartphones display. Also, it is the most comfortable mounting on the market. Just clip your phone to the front of the mounting and the mounting will securely keep it there with the help of its two powerful magnets.


Less cables, less hassle!
We are using the newest charging technology available right now: Wireless Charging. If your phone supports wireless charging you will never have to bother with any cables again.
And if it doesn't? Just plug the usb cable into the mounting, then into your phone and you'll never run out of juice again!


Wireless and wired charging, a bluetooth hands-free connection, audio and music streaming: Our Dashboard Mounting does it all.
And aren't you sick of all those cables running and hanging around in the interior of your car? The only cables you need are plugged into the back of our mounting. With their extra long reach you can guide them along the windshield down to your cars 12 V power outlet and your radios audio jack: A cable-free dashboard.


AppYourCar comes with an Innovative Mobile App. If you wish, it provides you with fast access to those apps and functions you want to use most frequently. 

It is divided into three categories: Communication, Media and Navigation. Use any of the three category screens to quickly start any third party app you like. Of course you can configure and adapt each category screen to your individual liking.
The Innovative Mobile App was specifically designed to be used while driving. With its easy to recognize buttons it's really convenient to use even while you're behind the wheel.

As seen on:








The idea for AppYourCar was born a little bit over a year ago. Since then we have worked tirelessly to improve upon the idea continuously. 
During this time our team grew and the idea evolved from being a fun and smart gadget we wanted for ourselves to a product you will want for your car as well.

We experimented with several different prototypes and software architectures to find the best solution for controlling a smartphone.
Demo - Controlling an Android phone with an older prototype:




Demo - Controlling an iPhone with an older prototype:



We now have a fully functional and finished prototype. We also have a manufacturer lined up with massive experience and countless global customers. 
That way we make sure that not only you will get your AppYourCar system on time, but also that it‘s the highest quality product we could possibly make.


We do have a fully functional prototype and our product components are almost ready for tooling and then mass production.

But we need your help to bring AppYourCar to market. Only together we can make this vision become reality: A Way to Use Your Smartphone Apps in Your Car!
Furthermore we started this crowdfunding campaign not only to raise the needed funds but also to gather as much input as possible from you - the crowd!
It is only with your invaluable input and support that we can finish this amazing new gadget.

</ul><p>Well we have. All the questions above are based on our very own experience. As a group of control engineers at REX Controls we have tackled such challenges many times. We have come to a conclusion that although the Raspberry Pi minicomputer is a toy (a fun toy and a real game-changer in many fields, but still a toy from the industrial automation point of view), it definitely has a place in the world of PLCs, PACs, IPCs, especially in the era of IoT and Industry 4.0.</p><p>With this campaign, we would like to validate our opinion and we'd be thrilled if you joined us on our way and supported our new hardware product.</p><h3>Yes, but they must be dressed properly for the occasion!</h3><p>Our journey with Raspberry Pi started the day it was introduced to the market.

<li>5 VDC power supply is not very common in industrial automation, not mentioning the microUSB power supply connector.</li>
<li>There was no enclosure nor DIN-rail mount for the Raspberry Pi available.</li>
<li>There were no add-on boards with analog inputs and outputs to interface with standard industrial sensors and devices.</li>
</ul><h4>Let's get dressed!</h4><p>Nowadays there are products more or less solving the mentioned problems, but neither of those is equipped with analog I/O which would meet our expectations.

Rowing has given many of these Para-
Rowers a new purpose or direction in
their lives. They have overcome their
disabilities and inspired others by their
courage and determination. This project
gives LTA rowers the opportunity to
compete at an international regatta,
taking their rowing to the next level. 


 However, as well as their training, and the challenges of their race, the crew faces an almighty challenge:  To raise $35,000 to cover the costs of the crew’s travel
and accommodation, regatta entry fees, boat hire fee and
team uniforms.But that's where you can help. 


What We Need & What You Get Coming from all over Australia, the crew are training both in their home clubs and coming together for a series of training camps in Sydney.  In addition, the crew will travel to Boston, need to hire a boat and oars, pay regatta entry fees, and purchase uniforms and other material. Conservatively, the total costs will be at least $35,000.However, the crew has been active in their fundraising.  Over $6,000 has been raised to date with the bulk of our fundraising activity occurring over the next few months, of which our indiegogo campaign will be a crucial component (though by no means the only fundraising going on!).  Any amount donated will help to reduce (and hopefully eliminate) the costs to the athletes (the coaches will be paying for their travel) so they can get on and focus on their training.The crew is incredibly appreciative of any support they receive, which will help them to achieve their goal!  The Impact After last year's win, para-rowing has experienced a huge boom in NSW and in Australia, which has led to increased competition, focus, and, most importantly, wider support and participation for more para athletes.  Bringing home a 'back-to-back' win would help to cement Australia's place on the international stage following on from an incredibly successful 2014 International Para-Rowing Regatta in which Australia was the most successful team.  Beyond the incredible impact upon the crew directly, your support will help our program to bring forward the next generation of para rowing athletes and, more broadly, increase participation, support, and the standard of para rowing across Australia.   Risks & Challenges What are the risks?Rowing is inherently an expensive sport, but as a community club in the heart of Balmain, NSW, Balmain Rowing Club has always sought to provide access to rowing for all members of the community.  Balmain's Para Rowing Program continues this vision for para athletes but we rely upon your support to for our program to continue.  If we don't reach our fundraising goals, our crew may not have the money to make it to Boston to compete, and the worst result for the crew would be not even making it to the start line.Another risk is that we go over and get beaten - but don't worry: our athletes and coaches are doing everything to prepare the crew and collectively our program has won 7 Australian Titles and 3 silver medals at the national level in the last 4 years, 6 State Championships, 8 silver medals and 4 bronze medals at the state level.  And we will be doing everything possible to prepare our crew for their race.

<p>As is the
case with many revolutionary products, it can be hard to describe exactly what
Mi World™ is. That's partly because it completely changes the way you interact
with your smart devices. </p>
<p>Previously
all your devices were just extensions of some sort of base PC or server.
Remember when you had to hook your iPhone to a computer to update files and
apps? Remember when your workgroup had to get on a VPN with a clone army of
laptops in order to collaborate? </p>
<p>While the
cloud changed some of that, it imposed limits. Without persistent internet
access, the mighty cloud does little good. Can you work on a Powerpoint
document in realtime on a smartphone at the same time your colleague is
presenting it from a laptop?</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F5W-I3zPgOZw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5W-I3zPgOZw&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F5W-I3zPgOZw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>
</p><p>Now you
can. And that's just the start.</p>
<p><b>Mi World™ brings the functionality of a PC,
media server, set-top box and a portable cloud in a palm-sized device with 30
hours of battery power.</b></p>
<p>What does
that mean to you?</p>
<p>●  <b>You can have a full-powered PC wherever you
go</b>, and without need for a monitor or a keyboard. Any smart device can be
your viewing and input mechanism.</p>
<p>●  <b>You never need to compromise when deciding
which files to bring with you.</b> Your entire video library; all your business
files; every song you own can travel with you.</p>
<p>●  <b>You can skimp on device storage.</b> Ever
wish you had more songs on your phone? More videos on your tablet? Tired of
swapping SD cards during a video shoot? Want to have an answer to every movie
request your child might make on a road-trip? Mi World™ has you covered. You no
longer need to think about how much space you have on your devices. </p>
<p>●  <b>You can trim back your data plan.</b> What
uses the bulk of your cellular data plan? Probably streaming media. That's no
longer a problem when your entire digital world is available wherever you go --
and without accessing the Internet.</p>
<p>●  <b>You can put off upgrading your devices.</b>
If you're tired of having to pony up every time a PC, tablet or smartphone
provider kicks up the processor a notch to accelerate upgrade cycles, Mi World™
saves the day by allowing your device to leverage its processor power. Don't
add to your processing power -- multiply it with Mi World™ and you might
actually get to be contract-free before you upgrade your phone.</p>
<p>Put another
way, Mi World™ enables your devices to perform as though you've never left home
or office. It saves you money on over-the-air internet service; storage
upgrades; and device upgrades. With Mi World™, you supercharge every connected
wi-fi capable device while saving money.</p>

<p><b>Why support us today?</b></p>
<p>We are
nearing the end of our Indiegogo campaign and after our beta run of devices for
supporters are shipped, there will be no more Mi World™ PCS devices available
until the full production run, which is being funded by our Indiegogo proceeds.</p>
<p>The devices
shipped in the Indiegogo preview run will be completely open. Production
devices shipped later will not. Your Indiegogo preview device will ship with
Android OS for testing and then will receive Myth Linux as an over-the-air
update.</p>
<p>100% of
funds raised go directly to fund production and fulfillment of Mi World™ PCS
units. The more we raise, the faster we will go. (Regardless of whether or not
we make our goal, all perks will be fulfilled.)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/540247/files/20140428125054-Mi_World_Icons-2.png?1398714654"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Why are developers special?</b></p>
<p>It is
important to us that the developer community help to test and extend the
capabilities of Mi World™. Developer-supporters whose perk includes a Mi World™
can request an SDK package.</p>
<p>We will
also have a private forum for early adopters to get support; make suggestions;
and stay up-to-date with enhancements and features. Over-the-air updates will
be delivered as soon as they become available.</p>
<p>We want to
know what Mi World™ looks like to you. The sooner you join us by supporting,
the sooner you can start tinkering.</p>

<p><i><b>Can Mi World™ PCS stream content to more than one smart device at the same time?</b>  <br/>
  Yes. Mi World™ PCS can stream the same movie or song or other digital data to all your devices simultaneously.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Can Mi World™ PCS stream different content to more than one smart device at the same time?  </b><br/>
  Yes. Mi World™ PCS can stream different movies or songs or other digital data to different devices at the same time.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Does Mi World™ PCS connect to the Internet?  </b><br/>
  Mi World™ PCS works with or without access to the Internet. It creates a local cloud that follows you wherever you go. Mi World™ PCS can also connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi to access remote storage.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Can Mi World™ PCS connect to the Internet and stream to other devices at the same time?  </b><br/>
  Yes. Mi World™ has Wi-Fi radios and can connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot and broadcast that signal to other devices.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Does Mi World™ PCS have a screen?  </b><br/>
  No. Mi World™ PCS can be accessed by any smart device (phone, tablet, watch, Google glass, laptop, TV, etc.) or SmartTV with HDMI interface.</i></p>
<p><i><b>I have a smartphone. Why do I need a Mi World™ PCS?  </b><br/>
  Smartphones are great, but their operating system is not the same as the operating system on the Mi World™ PCS.  In addition, smartphones do not offer the amount of local storage or ability to share/stream files to other devices. Smartphones are not able to make other smart devices more powerful. Mi World™ enables connected devices to share processing cycles (based on device compatibility) with other paired smart devices making the entire wireless ecosystem more powerful (smarter).</i></p>
<p><i><b>How does Mi World™ PCS Connect to Smart Devices?  </b><br/>
  Both wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) and wired (USB). Mi World also has HDMI interface to connect other terminals.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Is Mi World™ PCS secure?  </b><br/>
  Mi World™ PCS develops relationships with your devices. It only allows interaction between the devices you approve.  You set the level of security for each device. If an unknown device attempts a<br/>
connection, Mi World™ PCS rejects the connection.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Does Mi World™ PCS work as a 4G hotspot?  </b><br/>
  There will be versions of Mi World™ PCS that will act as a Smart LTE hotspot. Myth Innovations is currently talking with different telecommunication companies about offering 4G  connectivity.</i></p>
<p><i><b>What if I lose Mi World™ PCS?</b>Mi World™ PCS can identify its location through GPS and communicate back to the owner where it physically is or you can clear all storage if desired the first time it is connected to an internet connection.  It will not want to connect to any unauthorized device.</i></p>
<span style=""text-align: left;""><i><b>How much storage does Mi World™ PCS have?  </b><br/>
  Mi World™ PCS has a total of 5 SD card slots available.  There is 1 external full size card slot and 4 internal (must open the case) which includes 1 additional full size and 3 microSD slots.  Mi World™ ships with a base level of 64GB of SD storage. Larger capacity SD cards can be added.  For convenience we will offer models with 64GB, 128GB, 256GB and 512GB shipped with this additional storage.  The memory is user accessible so you can use your own SD cards if you would prefer.</i>
</span>
<p><i><b>How can I develop apps for Mi World™ PCS?  </b><br/>

<p><i><b>Does Mi World™ PCS work with businesses?  </b><br/>
  The amount of data being generated in 2014, along with the variety of data, requires businesses to view information almost like a natural resource.  Mi World™ PCS can connect to a corporate network and other devices in a meeting.  Since Mi World™ PCS can run applications, an example might be to display an executive score card during a meeting.  This would allow users to collaborate in a session, building presentations, reviewing situations or conduct a learning session together.</i></p>

changes everything.
Now, you
can:
●  Easily share files across up to 10
devices, without Internet access
●  Access all your media, documents and
applications anywhere, without depending on cloud-based Internet.
●  Securely work on the same document with
a team interacting in realtime via laptop, Android tablet; and iPhone.
With the Mi
World™ Portable Computing System (PCS) you really can ""take it with
you."" 

Join the Mi World™ revolution
As is the
case with many revolutionary products, it can be hard to describe exactly what
Mi World™ is. That's partly because it completely changes the way you interact
with your smart devices. 
Previously
all your devices were just extensions of some sort of base PC or server.
Remember when you had to hook your iPhone to a computer to update files and
apps? Remember when your workgroup had to get on a VPN with a clone army of
laptops in order to collaborate? 
While the
cloud changed some of that, it imposed limits. Without persistent internet
access, the mighty cloud does little good. Can you work on a Powerpoint
document in realtime on a smartphone at the same time your colleague is
presenting it from a laptop?
Now you
can. And that's just the start.
Mi World™ brings the functionality of a PC,
media server, set-top box and a portable cloud in a palm-sized device with 30
hours of battery power.
What does
that mean to you?
●  You can have a full-powered PC wherever you
go, and without need for a monitor or a keyboard. Any smart device can be
your viewing and input mechanism.
●  You never need to compromise when deciding
which files to bring with you. Your entire video library; all your business
files; every song you own can travel with you.
●  You can skimp on device storage. Ever
wish you had more songs on your phone? More videos on your tablet? Tired of
swapping SD cards during a video shoot? Want to have an answer to every movie
request your child might make on a road-trip? Mi World™ has you covered. You no
longer need to think about how much space you have on your devices. 
●  You can trim back your data plan. What
uses the bulk of your cellular data plan? Probably streaming media. That's no
longer a problem when your entire digital world is available wherever you go --
and without accessing the Internet.
●  You can put off upgrading your devices.
If you're tired of having to pony up every time a PC, tablet or smartphone
provider kicks up the processor a notch to accelerate upgrade cycles, Mi World™
saves the day by allowing your device to leverage its processor power. Don't
add to your processing power -- multiply it with Mi World™ and you might
actually get to be contract-free before you upgrade your phone.
Put another
way, Mi World™ enables your devices to perform as though you've never left home
or office. It saves you money on over-the-air internet service; storage
upgrades; and device upgrades. With Mi World™, you supercharge every connected
wi-fi capable device while saving money.

Why support us today?
We are
nearing the end of our Indiegogo campaign and after our beta run of devices for
supporters are shipped, there will be no more Mi World™ PCS devices available
until the full production run, which is being funded by our Indiegogo proceeds.
The devices
shipped in the Indiegogo preview run will be completely open. Production
devices shipped later will not. Your Indiegogo preview device will ship with
Android OS for testing and then will receive Myth Linux as an over-the-air
update.
100% of
funds raised go directly to fund production and fulfillment of Mi World™ PCS
units. The more we raise, the faster we will go. (Regardless of whether or not
we make our goal, all perks will be fulfilled.)

Why are developers special?
It is
important to us that the developer community help to test and extend the
capabilities of Mi World™. Developer-supporters whose perk includes a Mi World™
can request an SDK package.
We will
also have a private forum for early adopters to get support; make suggestions;
and stay up-to-date with enhancements and features. Over-the-air updates will
be delivered as soon as they become available.
We want to
know what Mi World™ looks like to you. The sooner you join us by supporting,
the sooner you can start tinkering.

I couldn't take a full time job because of the relatively short school hours.</p><p>My family had made several trips to Germany and the Netherlands and had always admired the tricycles with the cargo box on the front for the children to sit in.

The trikes have a pair of very substantial hubs on the front wheels that have a brake disc attached to each. These are not commercially available.  Some people have adapted wheelchair hubs for this purpose but I wanted something custom built for the job.</p><h1><br/></h1><h1>The Hubs...</h1><p>I designed and turned a pair of hubs that would be suitable.  We then had a second child...</p><p>The trike in current design would not be big enough for our larger family.  I redesigned the trike but this also meant that I would need new hubs.</p><p>Not wanting to waste the hubs I had made I decided to list them on eBay.  I got so many bids for them from people who were making their own projects that I could have sold them ten times over!</p><p>I put the trike to one side for the next few months and made hundreds of pairs of hubs, custom-made to customer specifications.</p><p>Eventually I had to make time for the trike as the children were pestering me to take them out on it.</p><p>I needed a tube bender to bend the chrome-moly steel tubing. Not wanting to pay as much for a bender as a trike would cost, I built my own but I needed three different sized dies for the different tubing that the bike was made from.  There are commercially available dies but the company that sold them wouldn't sell them to me as I hadn't bought a bender from them...</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""A pair of trike wheel hubs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/165/107/8ccab9b7ac187d9cfd0619cf7da365e3_original.JPG?v=1452257820&amp;w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=4b027f467850455ec6f331f33097a9bf"" src="""" style=""""/> <figcaption>A pair of trike wheel hubs</figcaption></figure><p></p><h1><br/></h1><h1>The Dies...</h1><p>I decided that I had to make my own dies.  To do this I would have to turn a concave form on my lathe.  Manual lathes are great at turning along straight lines and angles but one thing that they don't do very well is curves. This is done in industry by using a computer controlled (CNC) lathe.  I didn't have a CNC lathe...</p><p>There are attachments that can go on a lathe to create radii but being in four figures they were well out of my budget.</p><p>There was only one thing for it!  I had to make my own attachment...</p><h1><br/></h1><h1>The Attachment...</h1><p>It took three months to perfect the design.  It would not only create concave radii but also convex.  I had spent quite a lot of my trike budget on this attachment so I made an additional five to try to recoup some of this investment.  They sold on eBay in a couple of days.</p><p>I put the trike to one side and spent the next eighteen months making tool after tool to sell. The product became so successful that it reached a level that I couldn't supply enough by just machining the tool myself.  I sold my lathe, mill and welder and invested the money into getting a batch of tools machined abroad.  I assembled the tool in the UK as I wanted to own the quality control.</p><p>I succeeded in getting the tool into a retailer in the UK and also one in the USA. </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Repton RT1 Radius turning Attachment"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/165/108/b3e7a12209e815365bca4ea7347dc3f6_original.jpg?v=1452257865&amp;w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=f1b7cc12a3482fe75d1ff0da3cffd20f"" src="""" style=""""/> <figcaption>Repton RT1 Radius turning Attachment</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>As I was no longer machining the tools myself I had jigs and fittings that were taking up space in my garage (workshop/office &amp; factory!).  I took them to the local scrap yard to weigh them in for cash.</p><p>While I was at the scrap yard I saw two huge skips.  One contained bright copper wire and the other contained PVC coated wire.</p><p>I got into a conversation with the chap working there and asked him why one had been stripped and the other hadn't.  He told me that the coated wire was only still coated because the people who had cashed it in didn't have the tools to remove the insulation.</p><h1><br/></h1><h1>Strippers...</h1><p>This was a light bulb moment for me.  As soon as he told me that the stripped cable was bought for three times the cost of the coated cable I thought that I could buy the coated cable from him, strip it and, cash it in.</p><p>I searched and searched for methods of stripping the cable.  There are huge expensive industrial machines that you can buy and tools that you have to attach to a drill in order to operate it.  I was looking for something self-standing, handheld and portable. </p><p>I found a couple but they had utility knife blades that were exposed to the user and looked lethal.  There was no way that they were a viable tool.</p><p>I wanted to be able to strip all cables that you would find in a house or domestic situation.  The majority of the unstripped cable that I was going to buy had come from the domestic environment, including flat ""Twin and Earth"" type cables.  None of the strippers that I had found would handle flat cables.</p><p>I would have to build my own...</p><h1><br/></h1><h1>CableKnife...</h1><p>There were several considerations that I had when designing CableKnife.</p><p>The tool had to fit the following specification;</p><p><b>Types of Cable - </b>I had searched every type of tool that claims to strip insulation from cable, from the small homemade lethal tools up to the large industrial machines. They all had one thing in common - none of them would strip every type of cable that a domestic installer would use.  Some would only strip the smaller diameter cables and others would only handle the larger capacity cables.</p><p>I wanted to make a tool that would strip everything from 1mm∅ cable up to something as large as a 20mm∅ cable that a DIY'er might find on a car battery system or an old welder they were breaking down for scrap.</p><p>There is another issue of flat cables.  Every house has flat cables in it, from 1mm² cables for lighting circuits up to 16mm² 70 Amp Twin &amp; Earth cables that would be found on an electric shower or cooker circuit. </p><p>They all had to be stripped using the same tool, without the need to adjust any screws or clamps each time the user wanted to strip a different size cable. </p><p><b>Cutting Device -</b> The ""other"" strippers used proprietary cutting devices such as sharpened wheels or metal spikes with sharp points.  The downside to this is that at 4pm on a Friday afternoon when the Apprentice Electrician is stripping cable and the device goes blunt what can they do? Chances are they will not have bought a spare cutter and will have to purchase a replacement from the manufacturer often at great cost.  Some replacement cutting wheels cost more than the RRP of CableKnife!</p><p>I decided that as the utility knife blade is as common as Coke all over the World then the tool must use one as its cutting device.</p><p><b>Portable - </b>The tools which were already on the market that I had seen had many drawbacks. The biggest was their size.  They were either bolted to the floor, a workbench or in a vice. Some even needed to be connected to a power drill or electricity supply in order to work.</p><p>When I want to use a knife I don't want to have to put it in a vice or bolt it to the floor.  I want a portable tool.  CableKnife is essentially just a knife with a guide for the cable, that is part of the versatility of CableKnife.  I want to be able to put the tool in my tool box in the back of the van so that when I get a spare few minutes I can strip a couple of KG's of cable and not have to do it in the workshop.</p><p><b>Easy to Use -</b> All of the other tools have either pre-drilled holes for different diameter cables (which limits the cables that can be stripped) or have adjustable rollers that the user changes for each type of cable.  The issue with this is that unless the user has organised their cable to be stripped into size order they will have to adjust the tool every time the strip a length of cable.  I wanted the tool to need no adjustment for every cut.</p><p>I spent a few weeks taking measurements of different cables and designing ideas in Solidworks. </p><p>The parts needed to be prototyped accurately as there were tight tolerances that were important to the function of the tool.</p><p>3D prototyping is an economic way of reproducing parts for testing purposes, in particular laser sintering is a great balance of economy, accuracy and finish.  All in all, I had over 600 separate parts for the tool.

(skip to ""CableKnife..."" if you don't want my life story!)With a young family to look after I wanted to use my engineering skills to create some income while the children were at school. I couldn't take a full time job because of the relatively short school hours.My family had made several trips to Germany and the Netherlands and had always admired the tricycles with the cargo box on the front for the children to sit in. We considered buying one but were put off by the price.  They were over £2,500.  We parked that idea.
 Tricycle that we admired so much, courtesy of www.bakfiets.nlOn our return from the last trip I couldn't get the trikes out of my mind.  I was a competent Welder and Machinist.  I was confident on being able to make a trike.I sourced all of the materials, bought a TIG welder and a Colchester Lathe and set to work. The trikes have a pair of very substantial hubs on the front wheels that have a brake disc attached to each. These are not commercially available.  Some people have adapted wheelchair hubs for this purpose but I wanted something custom built for the job.The Hubs...I designed and turned a pair of hubs that would be suitable.  We then had a second child...The trike in current design would not be big enough for our larger family.  I redesigned the trike but this also meant that I would need new hubs.Not wanting to waste the hubs I had made I decided to list them on eBay.  I got so many bids for them from people who were making their own projects that I could have sold them ten times over!I put the trike to one side for the next few months and made hundreds of pairs of hubs, custom-made to customer specifications.Eventually I had to make time for the trike as the children were pestering me to take them out on it.I needed a tube bender to bend the chrome-moly steel tubing. Not wanting to pay as much for a bender as a trike would cost, I built my own but I needed three different sized dies for the different tubing that the bike was made from.  There are commercially available dies but the company that sold them wouldn't sell them to me as I hadn't bought a bender from them... A pair of trike wheel hubsThe Dies...I decided that I had to make my own dies.  To do this I would have to turn a concave form on my lathe.  Manual lathes are great at turning along straight lines and angles but one thing that they don't do very well is curves. This is done in industry by using a computer controlled (CNC) lathe.  I didn't have a CNC lathe...There are attachments that can go on a lathe to create radii but being in four figures they were well out of my budget.There was only one thing for it!  I had to make my own attachment...The Attachment...It took three months to perfect the design.  It would not only create concave radii but also convex.  I had spent quite a lot of my trike budget on this attachment so I made an additional five to try to recoup some of this investment.  They sold on eBay in a couple of days.I put the trike to one side and spent the next eighteen months making tool after tool to sell. The product became so successful that it reached a level that I couldn't supply enough by just machining the tool myself.  I sold my lathe, mill and welder and invested the money into getting a batch of tools machined abroad.  I assembled the tool in the UK as I wanted to own the quality control.I succeeded in getting the tool into a retailer in the UK and also one in the USA.  Repton RT1 Radius turning AttachmentAs I was no longer machining the tools myself I had jigs and fittings that were taking up space in my garage (workshop/office & factory!).  I took them to the local scrap yard to weigh them in for cash.While I was at the scrap yard I saw two huge skips.  One contained bright copper wire and the other contained PVC coated wire.I got into a conversation with the chap working there and asked him why one had been stripped and the other hadn't.  He told me that the coated wire was only still coated because the people who had cashed it in didn't have the tools to remove the insulation.Strippers...This was a light bulb moment for me.  As soon as he told me that the stripped cable was bought for three times the cost of the coated cable I thought that I could buy the coated cable from him, strip it and, cash it in.I searched and searched for methods of stripping the cable.  There are huge expensive industrial machines that you can buy and tools that you have to attach to a drill in order to operate it.  I was looking for something self-standing, handheld and portable. I found a couple but they had utility knife blades that were exposed to the user and looked lethal.  There was no way that they were a viable tool.I wanted to be able to strip all cables that you would find in a house or domestic situation.  The majority of the unstripped cable that I was going to buy had come from the domestic environment, including flat ""Twin and Earth"" type cables.  None of the strippers that I had found would handle flat cables.I would have to build my own...CableKnife...There were several considerations that I had when designing CableKnife.The tool had to fit the following specification;Types of Cable - I had searched every type of tool that claims to strip insulation from cable, from the small homemade lethal tools up to the large industrial machines. They all had one thing in common - none of them would strip every type of cable that a domestic installer would use.  Some would only strip the smaller diameter cables and others would only handle the larger capacity cables.I wanted to make a tool that would strip everything from 1mm∅ cable up to something as large as a 20mm∅ cable that a DIY'er might find on a car battery system or an old welder they were breaking down for scrap.There is another issue of flat cables.  Every house has flat cables in it, from 1mm² cables for lighting circuits up to 16mm² 70 Amp Twin & Earth cables that would be found on an electric shower or cooker circuit. They all had to be stripped using the same tool, without the need to adjust any screws or clamps each time the user wanted to strip a different size cable. Cutting Device - The ""other"" strippers used proprietary cutting devices such as sharpened wheels or metal spikes with sharp points.  The downside to this is that at 4pm on a Friday afternoon when the Apprentice Electrician is stripping cable and the device goes blunt what can they do? Chances are they will not have bought a spare cutter and will have to purchase a replacement from the manufacturer often at great cost.  Some replacement cutting wheels cost more than the RRP of CableKnife!I decided that as the utility knife blade is as common as Coke all over the World then the tool must use one as its cutting device.Portable - The tools which were already on the market that I had seen had many drawbacks. The biggest was their size.  They were either bolted to the floor, a workbench or in a vice. Some even needed to be connected to a power drill or electricity supply in order to work.When I want to use a knife I don't want to have to put it in a vice or bolt it to the floor.  I want a portable tool.  CableKnife is essentially just a knife with a guide for the cable, that is part of the versatility of CableKnife.  I want to be able to put the tool in my tool box in the back of the van so that when I get a spare few minutes I can strip a couple of KG's of cable and not have to do it in the workshop.Easy to Use - All of the other tools have either pre-drilled holes for different diameter cables (which limits the cables that can be stripped) or have adjustable rollers that the user changes for each type of cable.  The issue with this is that unless the user has organised their cable to be stripped into size order they will have to adjust the tool every time the strip a length of cable.  I wanted the tool to need no adjustment for every cut.I spent a few weeks taking measurements of different cables and designing ideas in Solidworks. The parts needed to be prototyped accurately as there were tight tolerances that were important to the function of the tool.3D prototyping is an economic way of reproducing parts for testing purposes, in particular laser sintering is a great balance of economy, accuracy and finish.  All in all, I had over 600 separate parts for the tool. Bearing in mind that the final design of the tool has only 5 parts, it shows just how reliant I was on this fast economic prototyping method. Evolution of CableKnifeOnce I had settled on the functional design I had the parts silicone cast. This method produces a part that is almost as accurate and durable as an injection moulded part, therefore allowing me to get coloured plastic parts to test fully for form and function.  These have also been tested to destruction.One hundred and thirty four prototypes and CableKnife was born! Final working silicone moulded prototype CableKnifeI never did build that trike...The Campaign...What is the campaign for?This is not our first campaign, we have successfully finished a kickStarter campaign.We needed £15,000 for production costs.

</div></div>","MagDock = All-in-one Wireless Charger + Smart Power Bank + Zip-&-Go Travel Kit  MagDock is the new ultimate all-in-one wireless charging dock for all your devices, a standby power bank monitored by IoT technology, and a zip-&-go traveling kit for all the power you need on the go.                                      The age of wireless charging is coming. But do we really need it?
You can't watch videos with comfortable view angle when charging with a wireless charging pad. 

 
You may find your phone battery flat in the morning. A slight knock can move your device out of place and stop it charging.

 
We thought the Apple Airpower would save us until we tried to charge a watch with a linked loop band:

 
We still believe in wireless charging, but it needs some revolutionary improvements. We wanted something really useful and convenient. So we created MagDock.

As Your All-in-One Wireless Charger

 
The MagDock can charge up to 3 of your devices all at once. A convenient stand for all your devices that dispenses with the mess of cables and the limited USB sockets you may have near you.
The devices that you can charge on MagDock include;

Twist and Dock
 

 
The innovative design of a twistable top has taken your standard charging dock, and turned it into a convenient stand for your devices and for you!
Using Whilst Charging

 
The twistable design allows you to adjust it for the best viewing angles you need. You can even facetime with your friends hands-free whilst charging it.
 
Auto-Align Magnetic Design
We know that feeling, you find your phone battery still flat after charging over-night on the charging pad. Something unexpected knocked it off from charging area accidentally, the kids, the pet or even you. 
With the MagDock, this can’t happen anymore.
Embedded with magnets whilst not interfering with the wireless charging, MagDock auto aligns your phone once being attached on. Your phone would stick on the charging area tightly and being charged continuously. 

 
Zero Light Emittance

Without any light indicators, MagDock has no light leakage while charging your devices and is ideal as a nightstand charger and organizer. 
 
As Your Portable Power Bank  
Inbuilt with a 7800mAh battery, MagDock is a back-up power bank too. More importantly, MagDock charges itself and it is always ready for your next use. Whenever you need a power bank, it is there. 

No matter you're waiting for the flight during your trip:

Or reading the latest work report at Cafe;

Or going for a relaxing outdoor adventure, whenever you need it, just grab it and it ensures your device never runs out of power!

Also, the power bank has a large capacity of 7800 mAh, which supports 2 charges of iPhone X or 25 charges of Apple Watch 3.

Note: Inbuilt power bank is available in only MagDock Pro version.  
 
Undirected Single-Port Design

Simplicity is the hidden complexity. With the undirected single-port design, any way you plug in is the right way of charging.
 
And there are more...
As Your Zip-&-Go Travel Kit

 
We provide an optional premium travel pouch. So every time you go for a trip, storing your MagDock in the pouch, zip and go. Say goodbye to messy cables when being on the go or fly.


 
And with the 30W PD adaptor supplied, which charges both MagDock and even laptop, the MagDock is all the power you need for your trip.

 
Smart Track Your Charging  
MagDock’s companion app keeps track of charging and lets you know whether the device on is charging or not. Available for iOS & Android.

You will be notified if the MagDock battery is low, fully charged, or unplugged from the mains socket accidentally:

 The companion APP is available for iOS & Android.

Optional Extra Wireless Charger Pad
More than one device needs charging? You can always expand the wireless charging for more devices with the additional optional charger pad - MagPad.

 
MagPad is actually a 10W wireless charger and can be used independently to charge any Qi-compatible devices, including the new AirPods that Apple plans to launch this year.

And there's more...
Reusable Nano Gel Base  

Stability is reliability. Whether you are attaching or removing devices, you will never have any vibration, moving or sliding of the MagDock. The Nano gel base provides a secure base allowing the MagDock to always stick in the right place.
Fits for Different Apple Watch Cases & Bands

<p>Billsup is a simple tool to track debts and manage shared bills amongst friends. For this campaign, we are building its web application and its Android application, which will allow users to record bills, track payments and debts, and send a reminder to friends.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Watch the video above</strong> :-)</h3>
<h1><strong>Why?</strong></h1>
<p>During college, Anup shared a house with a bunch of roommates. Between rent, daily expenses, and group trips, it became very difficult to keep track of I-owe-you's. Anup found that the existing tools and websites do not have the ease-of-use and flexibility that he wanted, so billsup is being built to help people like Anup - those who want an easy way to keep track of debt and shared bills with friends. Billsup came as a side project for us, and we're building it as a tool to help people like us.</p>
<h1>So how does this work?</h1>
<p>Support us by funding to our project. Depending on how much you contribute, you can choose one of the different rewards at your pledge tier! :-) If you are outside of Canada or US, please add $5 to your pledge to account for shipping costs.</p>
<p>You could also pledge without picking a reward.</p>
<h3>How about equity? Can I pledge for a share of the company?</h3>
<p>I've been asked this question by multiple people - we really would appreciate your pldeges, but currently we are not considering distributing equity, unless your pledge amount exceeds $10,000 USD - if that's the case, contact us at info@billsup.com. Otherwise, you could still pledge any amount without picking a reward if you do not want any of the rewards.</p>
<h1><strong>Where is the money going?</strong></h1>
<p>Our goal of $3000 is actually a very small portion of our operational cost, so it'd be great if we can exceed our goal. The money we do collect <em><strong>will</strong> </em>be going directly to making this project happen. So far, we've been using our own time to build the project, and spending our own funds to host the website and various other operations. With your contribution, we would be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy more Android devices to test our application on different platforms </li>
<li>Spend more time building features that users want </li>
<li>Pay for part of our operation cost such as domain hosting, various development software and equipment </li>
<li>Plan and build the tool for other platforms </li>
</ul><p>Even though this has been a side project, we're working hard on completing it, and will be spending a lot more time on it if the campaign is successful.  Our current plan is to complete the web application by the end of June, and the Android application by the end of July.</p>
<h3>I'm not from US or Canada, can I still contribute?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can contribute from anywhere in the world! Every bit helps, thanks so much for your support!</p>

<h3>What's a lifetime premium account?</h3>
<p>Although the application is intended to be free, we will be serving ads to sustain the operational costs of running the website. We plan on setting up premium accounts that have access to ad-free versions of the website for a small monthly fee. As a ""lifetime premium account"" holder for supporting us in this campaign, you will get premium account status for free for the lifetime of the website.</p>
<h3>What's a private beta?</h3>
<p>When a new version or feature of the application is developed, we first release it to a limited number of people to try it out and give us feedback (if they want to) for a period of time, usually 1 to 3 weeks before the actual features are available to everyone. This period of time is called the private beta, and only certain people (we trust) gets to participate! In short, you get bragging rights to say ""first!"", and also we'll pay more attention to the  feedback of our private beta people!</p>
<h3>How about other sites that manage bills/debts?</h3>
<p>We plan to build a solution that's catered to the user's needs, including mobile and web application that works well together so that bills/debts can be managed anywhere. With your contributions, we can implement these features and port to more platforms faster - thanks!</p>
