<h3>Update March 15, 2017</h3>
<p>I started Cluster of Billionaires as a book about self made billionaires whom I knew personally or whose many hours long interviews I watched on the web with the old headhunter’s scrutiny. I’ve spotted some common features in them and decided to season them with a gravy from neuroscience, psychology and biology to add more taste and flavour.</p>
<p>Every book, however, starts to dictate its own terms after you write maybe 50 pages or little more. First, a comparison between human and ant behavior grew from a metaphor into an important line of thought. Then, Bayesian probability and Markov process popped up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>The tipping point took place at the third day after I’d launched a crowdfunding campaign for the book and began to record interesting thoughts about the book on video. When I spoke about epigenetic transformation in ants it suddenly struck me that changes which I observed in billionaires may also be epigenetic by origin.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes take place with many species in nature when some genes already present in their DNA get turned on or off by either social or environmental factors, or a combination of both.  In the case of ants such changes  are very deep internally - they totally change their physiology - but have no visible  signs at the outside. They are achieved by ants taking part in ritualized fightings in which they fight long and hard but without hurting their opponents. As a result they make their dopamine level to rise 3-4 fold with that effect lasting for hours. So they achieve powerful and long lasting enough effect to trigger and complete an epigenetic mutation.</p>
<p>Let’s have a closer look at many self made billionaires. With all their passion, lust for action, readiness to take risks, resilience to failures they expose themselves to factors which have rather strong effect each taken separately but produce a totally overwhelming impact if they are combined and last for years. Can we imagine that some epigenetic mutations may well take place altering the physiology of their brains? My answer is: “Yes.”</p>
<p>The process of transformation had to start long before they actually became billionaires. If we know what we are looking for, we will be able to spot future billionaires and maybe even to nurture them.</p> <p>The wild idea came to my mind less than a week ago.

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Update March 15, 2017
I started Cluster of Billionaires as a book about self made billionaires whom I knew personally or whose many hours long interviews I watched on the web with the old headhunter’s scrutiny. I’ve spotted some common features in them and decided to season them with a gravy from neuroscience, psychology and biology to add more taste and flavour.
Every book, however, starts to dictate its own terms after you write maybe 50 pages or little more. First, a comparison between human and ant behavior grew from a metaphor into an important line of thought. Then, Bayesian probability and Markov process popped up out of nowhere.
The tipping point took place at the third day after I’d launched a crowdfunding campaign for the book and began to record interesting thoughts about the book on video. When I spoke about epigenetic transformation in ants it suddenly struck me that changes which I observed in billionaires may also be epigenetic by origin.
Epigenetic changes take place with many species in nature when some genes already present in their DNA get turned on or off by either social or environmental factors, or a combination of both.  In the case of ants such changes  are very deep internally - they totally change their physiology - but have no visible  signs at the outside. They are achieved by ants taking part in ritualized fightings in which they fight long and hard but without hurting their opponents. As a result they make their dopamine level to rise 3-4 fold with that effect lasting for hours. So they achieve powerful and long lasting enough effect to trigger and complete an epigenetic mutation.
Let’s have a closer look at many self made billionaires. With all their passion, lust for action, readiness to take risks, resilience to failures they expose themselves to factors which have rather strong effect each taken separately but produce a totally overwhelming impact if they are combined and last for years. Can we imagine that some epigenetic mutations may well take place altering the physiology of their brains? My answer is: “Yes.”
The process of transformation had to start long before they actually became billionaires. If we know what we are looking for, we will be able to spot future billionaires and maybe even to nurture them. The wild idea came to my mind less than a week ago. Now I know that epigenetics is a hot topic in neuroscience because the human brain undergoes more epigenetic transformations than any organ of any other species. Now I want in this book to explore the factors which trigger and support the 'billionaire mutation' and to observe the implications of such a mutation as well.
The word mutation is a bit provocative, of course, especially given the fact that it is reversible because genes can be switched on and off, but I use it to emphasise the power and depth of this invisible but radical change.
As the crowdfunding campaign already inspired such a breakthrough I wish to make another try with it. The deadline is soon but it can be postponed if we see traction.

""This magnificent book will change your life!"" Based on biographical research, in the first edition of ""A Lifetime of Personal Power"" Dr. Janin tells us about numerous transformations she has been involved with. Transformations which have already changed the lives of so many people in South Africa!

After meeting Erno in March 2017 in South Africa, Dr. Janin offered him a copy of her book. After being captivated by the introduction, that same day Erno read all 260 pages and he realized he had struck gold: ""This is an amazing book which should become available to everybody anywhere in the world!""

 
Praise over the First Edition
This book has proven to be attractive readers from all over the globe, from all age-groups and from completely different cultural backgrounds.


""I feel the power when I read this book. The message is presented in a brief and simple way. Interpreting the word ""develop"" into de-envelop really attracted me. This book has opened my mind to motivate my students towards their own development. Through education, human civilization can be developed towards a better and modern society."" (Wahyu, ID, 35 y.)

""As I'm completing my Master in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, I'm surrounded by brilliant people from every continent of our globe. Dr. Janin's book makes me release how important this exploratory phase in my life is and how fortunate I am to be a ""global citizen"". This book was a really great gift, awesome!"" (Marcel, UK, 24 y.)


""Revealing about ourselves, this book is a real eye-opener. The sharing of real-life stories, including stories about Janin's own life, makes this book step away from the strictly theoretical approach. You can see these people sitting on the coach near the fireplace, learn from their experiences and their changes. This was wonderful!"" (Henry & Vanessa, ZA, 55+)

 
Our Book Fund & Global Team


The last 20 copies of the first edition were shipped around the globe to people from all age groups. Their immediate responses: ""Powerful"", ""Transformational"", ""Revealing"", ""Biographical"", ""Life changing"", ""I love the 7 Year Cycle of Life"", ""I now have a clearer understanding of why things happen in my life"".

 For Erno this was the reason to reinstate his global book fund. This initiative, ""Powered by PLLLLus.org"", allows authors to focus on creating beautiful and meaningful content. Our  global community takes care of everything else. Working with Mawethu and Henry, they assembled the global team to create V2 of this great book.

 
Upgrading Content V1 -> V2


In the first edition of her book, in 260 pages Dr. Janin created a very well balanced mix of theoretical backgrounds, real-live experiences from her interactions with clients (obviously anonymous) as well as experiences from her own life. And these ingredients make this book so inspiring and captivating.
Imagine reading chapter by chapter, based on the 7 year Cycle of Life, about different stages in your own life. The book will explain experiences from your past. Even better, it will prepare you for what is still coming - you will want to read on and learn more. You will agree: very powerful content!
TIP: Are you interested in the chapter ""Introduction"" from the first edition of this book? Just click here to request your preview.


The second edition will offer even more: Dr. Janin is currently writing additional CONTENT, so a new chapter can be added. With your support, our expert layout designer Jacob will refresh the content & layout to create a print-ready document with almost 300 pages of very exciting and revealing content.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Who? A bit about me ...</h3><p>My name is Jana Gatien. I do all the conceptualizing, art and text for these books. I live on Salt Spring Island, BC, Canada. I had an idyllic childhood by current standards. A rocky adolescence (7 highschools … I was not conformable). And a trek off the beaten path ever since. I’m a mixed media artist, writer and illustrator. I waitress to pay rent while I create stuff. It doesn’t sound glamorous, but it allows an independence from the book and entertainment industry that helps me keep a certain level of quality and integrity in my work, which I’ve been asked to compromise on numerous occasions. I moved out West from Toronto 2.5 years ago, where I was a ghost-writer, waitress, food stylist/cookbook producer, yoga instructor and event manager over a 15 year span. I’ve also lived in Atlanta, Montreal and Hawaii.</p><p><strong>WHY This Project Is Important to Me</strong><br/>When I was little, I felt an eerie absence of context. A lack of orientation in how to proceed into life. Everything seemed fragmented and incohesive. I didn’t know my role, my story or my relationship with the world. I didn’t know how to be effective, what I’m responsible for, how to think logically, and how not to uncontrollably worry about the disempowerment entailed in not having what seemed like basics. Things felt clunky, convoluted, inefficient, seemingly random and irreconcilably (sickeningly) contradictory. Shattered even. Was life really so precarious and undeterminable? Was I doomed to perpetual confusion? Is hypocrisy natural? Am I really supposed to be quiet and do as normality dictates? There’s more, right? You’re gonna tell me the good stuff soon, right, Pa?</p><p>I remember in fourth grade listening to my homeroom teacher offer a tired, scripted explanation of how clouds are formed. Noticing her faraway, gossamer-framed eyes, the boils on her neck, and her defeated, bland tone, it dawned on me that she didn’t embody a speck of knowledge. She was like the walking dead, “nice” as she was. I started to pay attention to others, whether they employed bravado, swagger, sternness, meekness, authoritativeness, whatever … it started to dawn on me that no one knew anything. Not the teachers. Not my parents. Not the experts. Not the textbooks I was to take as gospel. It was just a weird script they were pushing. I further realized that such a bleak situation thereby implied that I had to figure out and clarify very big questions for myself. Tall order, I suppose, for a 9 year old. I didn’t even know how to articulate what I knew I needed to do. I just knew I wasn't going to go along to get along. That would never be my way. </p><p>So the Bobby Books really represent what I wished I’d had as a little person: a working model of reality and my relationship with it. Some vocabulary for universal ideas that I could always feel, but that were painfully omitted from the “normal” lexicon. As well as a character model that’s exhibits independent questioning, contemplation, troubleshooting, investigation, creativity and self-determination within this reality. Someone who discerns when he’s defaulted into mindlessly running someone else’s script … or whether he’s writing his own.</p><p>Of course, the books don’t give all the answers about everything. I too wanted to figure stuff out for myself in my own unique way. I didn’t want someone else to ruin the satisfaction of personal discovery. But I certainly would have appreciated <i>not</i> being coerced into going in the completely wrong direction; to not have had my sensibilities set up against my own growth. I would have welcomed something helpful and wise on my bedside table; a gentle compass to orient me in thinking and living. Something that encouraged the mindset that I could and indeed <i>should</i> take things into my own head, heart and hands, figure stuff out and determine my own way to go.</p><p>It is my sincere hope that this series strikes a chord with small folk and parents alike, and that it brings a valuable influence in the growth and formation of true-hearted, right-headed individuals.</p><p>The Bobby series could easily be adapted to complimentary mediums like animated web series, games, toys, educational material and so on. I have developed a full-blown treatment for an animated series, complete with a season’s worth of episode synopses and 3 scripts. There are also 17 more Bobby Books at different stages of progress.</p><p>If we make the financial goal, we’ll get 3 books rolling into print and distribution, with 500 hard copies of each. If we make less, then we get 1 or 2 books rolling. If we make more, we can do more books, playbooks (activity books) and animated projects. I’ll leave this all to be determined according to your feedback, desire and support for such a project to grow.</p><p><strong>WHAT WE NEED </strong><br/>We will be printing Bobby Books with Friesen Press, a reputable family-run, century-old publishing house that publishes (publishing = print <i>and</i> distribute) rather than merely lays out and prints, as do many self-publishing outlets.</p><p>The fee before taxes, per book (laid out, templated, formatted for paper and digital, barcoded, reviewed by book critics and synched into 39,000 distribution channels … and to manage sales and printing runs from there on end) is $1785.11 ($1699.11 w/out tax) per book for the first two books <i>only</i>, which I’ve committed to do with Friesen at a first-time-only discount of 15% from their usual fees … this price applies only for the first two books). The third book would be $1999 plus 5% tax (so $2100). Each physical copy of the book costs approximately $2.97 per unit to print (and then retails at approximately $12.99). So:</p><p>FRIESEN SET UP: 1785.11 + 1785.11 + 2100 = $5670.22<br/>HARDCOPIES: $2.97 x 500 = $1485 x 3books = $4455<br/>$5670.22 + $4455<br/>FOR A TOTAL OF= $10,125.22</p><p>Let’s also consider fulfillment of supporter perks and mail costs at $375 for a<br/><strong>GRAND TOTAL OF $10,500</strong></p><p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong><br/>In addition to a book series now in existence that exhibits the psychological architecture of good character and wholeness of being, you get some personal stuff yourself to reward your support. Please check out the Perks/Rewards section for specifics. There's some fun ideas in there. </p><p><br/><strong>THE IMPACT ON/VALUE IN WORLD</strong><br/>In recent years, I see many minds (of all ages, really) oriented to victim mentality. The victim’s virtual reality goggles divides people and holds everyone else responsible for their experience, which is not technically possible nor helpful. In fact, such powerlessness enrages, frustrates and spiritually devastates. It’s implications are crazy-making. To offset the potential damage of such the blame-game/lifelong baby mentality, I feel it’s important to present the architecture of individuality, self-responsibility and self-determination, to help form healthy, discerning, empowered, innovative and courageous people. The world is not safe. You’ll fall on your bottom and tear your jeans here and there. A synthetic safe womb builds babies who always look for someone to take care of them, decide for them, direct them and tell them what the answers are.

I had an idyllic childhood by current standards. A rocky adolescence (7 highschools … I was not conformable). And a trek off the beaten path ever since. I’m a mixed media artist, writer and illustrator. I waitress to pay rent while I create stuff. It doesn’t sound glamorous, but it allows an independence from the book and entertainment industry that helps me keep a certain level of quality and integrity in my work, which I’ve been asked to compromise on numerous occasions. I moved out West from Toronto 2.5 years ago, where I was a ghost-writer, waitress, food stylist/cookbook producer, yoga instructor and event manager over a 15 year span. I’ve also lived in Atlanta, Montreal and Hawaii.WHY This Project Is Important to MeWhen I was little, I felt an eerie absence of context. A lack of orientation in how to proceed into life. Everything seemed fragmented and incohesive. I didn’t know my role, my story or my relationship with the world. I didn’t know how to be effective, what I’m responsible for, how to think logically, and how not to uncontrollably worry about the disempowerment entailed in not having what seemed like basics. Things felt clunky, convoluted, inefficient, seemingly random and irreconcilably (sickeningly) contradictory. Shattered even. Was life really so precarious and undeterminable? Was I doomed to perpetual confusion? Is hypocrisy natural? Am I really supposed to be quiet and do as normality dictates? There’s more, right? You’re gonna tell me the good stuff soon, right, Pa?I remember in fourth grade listening to my homeroom teacher offer a tired, scripted explanation of how clouds are formed. Noticing her faraway, gossamer-framed eyes, the boils on her neck, and her defeated, bland tone, it dawned on me that she didn’t embody a speck of knowledge. She was like the walking dead, “nice” as she was. I started to pay attention to others, whether they employed bravado, swagger, sternness, meekness, authoritativeness, whatever … it started to dawn on me that no one knew anything. Not the teachers. Not my parents. Not the experts. Not the textbooks I was to take as gospel. It was just a weird script they were pushing. I further realized that such a bleak situation thereby implied that I had to figure out and clarify very big questions for myself. Tall order, I suppose, for a 9 year old. I didn’t even know how to articulate what I knew I needed to do. I just knew I wasn't going to go along to get along. That would never be my way. So the Bobby Books really represent what I wished I’d had as a little person: a working model of reality and my relationship with it. Some vocabulary for universal ideas that I could always feel, but that were painfully omitted from the “normal” lexicon. As well as a character model that’s exhibits independent questioning, contemplation, troubleshooting, investigation, creativity and self-determination within this reality. Someone who discerns when he’s defaulted into mindlessly running someone else’s script … or whether he’s writing his own.Of course, the books don’t give all the answers about everything. I too wanted to figure stuff out for myself in my own unique way. I didn’t want someone else to ruin the satisfaction of personal discovery. But I certainly would have appreciated not being coerced into going in the completely wrong direction; to not have had my sensibilities set up against my own growth. I would have welcomed something helpful and wise on my bedside table; a gentle compass to orient me in thinking and living. Something that encouraged the mindset that I could and indeed should take things into my own head, heart and hands, figure stuff out and determine my own way to go.It is my sincere hope that this series strikes a chord with small folk and parents alike, and that it brings a valuable influence in the growth and formation of true-hearted, right-headed individuals.The Bobby series could easily be adapted to complimentary mediums like animated web series, games, toys, educational material and so on. I have developed a full-blown treatment for an animated series, complete with a season’s worth of episode synopses and 3 scripts. There are also 17 more Bobby Books at different stages of progress.If we make the financial goal, we’ll get 3 books rolling into print and distribution, with 500 hard copies of each. If we make less, then we get 1 or 2 books rolling. If we make more, we can do more books, playbooks (activity books) and animated projects. I’ll leave this all to be determined according to your feedback, desire and support for such a project to grow.WHAT WE NEED We will be printing Bobby Books with Friesen Press, a reputable family-run, century-old publishing house that publishes (publishing = print and distribute) rather than merely lays out and prints, as do many self-publishing outlets.The fee before taxes, per book (laid out, templated, formatted for paper and digital, barcoded, reviewed by book critics and synched into 39,000 distribution channels … and to manage sales and printing runs from there on end) is $1785.11 ($1699.11 w/out tax) per book for the first two books only, which I’ve committed to do with Friesen at a first-time-only discount of 15% from their usual fees … this price applies only for the first two books). The third book would be $1999 plus 5% tax (so $2100). Each physical copy of the book costs approximately $2.97 per unit to print (and then retails at approximately $12.99). So:FRIESEN SET UP: 1785.11 + 1785.11 + 2100 = $5670.22HARDCOPIES: $2.97 x 500 = $1485 x 3books = $4455$5670.22 + $4455FOR A TOTAL OF= $10,125.22Let’s also consider fulfillment of supporter perks and mail costs at $375 for aGRAND TOTAL OF $10,500WHAT YOU GETIn addition to a book series now in existence that exhibits the psychological architecture of good character and wholeness of being, you get some personal stuff yourself to reward your support. Please check out the Perks/Rewards section for specifics. There's some fun ideas in there. THE IMPACT ON/VALUE IN WORLDIn recent years, I see many minds (of all ages, really) oriented to victim mentality. The victim’s virtual reality goggles divides people and holds everyone else responsible for their experience, which is not technically possible nor helpful. In fact, such powerlessness enrages, frustrates and spiritually devastates. It’s implications are crazy-making. To offset the potential damage of such the blame-game/lifelong baby mentality, I feel it’s important to present the architecture of individuality, self-responsibility and self-determination, to help form healthy, discerning, empowered, innovative and courageous people. The world is not safe. You’ll fall on your bottom and tear your jeans here and there. A synthetic safe womb builds babies who always look for someone to take care of them, decide for them, direct them and tell them what the answers are. A natural world builds responsible, capable humans who learn, discern and decide based on experience. A natural world demands we rise to its challenges, rather than shrink from them.  Bobby Books model a blossoming self-empowered individual. In learning to manage his imagination, mood ‘n tude, Bobby comes to understand how to take responsibility for himself and do his own thing, without needing conformity or consensus from others. To be change, rather than demand it (or blame others for the way things are!). To have the courage to see dishonesty and to be honest, even if it's unpopular.

<h3>Help me get my book into the hands of artists.</h3>
<p><strong>My name is Christ John Otto and I am an artist and writer. </strong> For ten years I have been directing a non-profit organization called Belonging House.  We raise up artists who are committed to building Jesus Christ a throne in the earth.  </p>
<p><strong><i>Mary: When God Shares His Glory</i>, is the second book in a 5 book series.</strong>  The series is a follow up to my first book <i>An Army Arising: Why Artists are on the Frontline of the Next Move of God</i>.  </p>
<p><strong>My new book is all about identity. </strong> In my books I try to answer the important questions people are asking: </p>
<p>“Do I have value?” </p>
<p>“Where do I belong?” and</p>
<p>“What is my true identity?” </p>
<p><strong>At the same time, I believe that creative people are ""priests"" to a digital visual culture.</strong>  They need to grasp the foundational truths that will serve as a foundation to their creative output.  Your inner life determines your creative output.</p>
<p><strong><i>An Army Arising</i> sold over 4000 copies without a marketing campaign or strategy. </strong> With <i>Mary</i> we would like to sell 5000 copies.  We believe we can achieve most of this goal before the end of 2016.  In order to do this we will need to invest in marketing, advertising, and travel.</p>
<p><strong>Your contribution will help meet these goals, and help empower the men and women equipped to transform a digital visual culture.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The book is already in the design phase. </p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 would pay for the design costs of the book.</li>
<li>$1000 will pay for flights to do a book launch in the UK and the US (My books have developed a large following in the UK).</li>
<li>$1000 would be used to develop a Youtube channel around my books.</li>
<li>$2000 would be used to purchase online advertising.</li>
<li>The remaining $5000 would be used to develop and design a large format picture book that contains most of the key ideas from An Army Arising, Bezalel, and Mary.  We believe that we are not reaching our target audience simply because we are using a traditional book format.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As a thank you for contributing you will receive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For $25 I will send you a signed copy of <i>Mary: When God Shares His Glory</i>
</li>
<li>For $50 I will send you a signed copy of <i>Mary</i> and <i>Bezalel: Redeeming a Renegade Creation.</i>
</li>
<li>For $100 you will receive a signed copy of <i>Bezalel, Mary</i>, and a “Scripture in a Bottle” necklace.</li>
<li>For $1000 I will have coffee with you (in the continental US) and we can ask me any question about art, artists, and our books.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don’t meet our goal we will use the funds toward the design costs and travel.  Anything else will go to the continued work of Belonging House.</p>
<p> </p>

My new book is all about identity.  In my books I try to answer the important questions people are asking: 
“Do I have value?” 
“Where do I belong?” and
“What is my true identity?” 
At the same time, I believe that creative people are ""priests"" to a digital visual culture.  They need to grasp the foundational truths that will serve as a foundation to their creative output.  Your inner life determines your creative output.
An Army Arising sold over 4000 copies without a marketing campaign or strategy.  With Mary we would like to sell 5000 copies.  We believe we can achieve most of this goal before the end of 2016.  In order to do this we will need to invest in marketing, advertising, and travel.
Your contribution will help meet these goals, and help empower the men and women equipped to transform a digital visual culture.
 

What We Need & What You Get
The book is already in the design phase. 

$1000 would pay for the design costs of the book.
$1000 will pay for flights to do a book launch in the UK and the US (My books have developed a large following in the UK).
$1000 would be used to develop a Youtube channel around my books.
$2000 would be used to purchase online advertising.
The remaining $5000 would be used to develop and design a large format picture book that contains most of the key ideas from An Army Arising, Bezalel, and Mary.  We believe that we are not reaching our target audience simply because we are using a traditional book format.  

As a thank you for contributing you will receive:

For $25 I will send you a signed copy of Mary: When God Shares His Glory

For $50 I will send you a signed copy of Mary and Bezalel: Redeeming a Renegade Creation.

For $100 you will receive a signed copy of Bezalel, Mary, and a “Scripture in a Bottle” necklace.
For $1000 I will have coffee with you (in the continental US) and we can ask me any question about art, artists, and our books.

If we don’t meet our goal we will use the funds toward the design costs and travel.  Anything else will go to the continued work of Belonging House.

<h2><strong><u>Why UNITED NATION?</u></strong></h2>
<p>Today, a great disconnect exists in the general perception of Israel throughout the world. Israel is the only country where a global boycott and sanctions movement against it continues unabated on most college and university campuses in the United States and elsewhere and there are more United Nations resolutions against Israel- 62 in total – than all other countries combined.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><i>On The Water</i> is a collection of prose, non-fiction, performance writing and poetry, which has been written and assembled by writers from Southampton.</p>
<p>It's published by Solent Press, which is staffed by students of Southampton Solent University. We want to show off the diverse range of talent and imagination within our university and in Southampton and share it with the broader public as well.</p>
<p>The call for submissions went out last autumn: we received 110  from a range of authors; a mixture of students, members of staff and people from Southampton. After blind editing, the selected pieces were sequenced and illustrated.</p>
<p>The book is arranged to take the reader on a journey. It's not organised into sections of prose or poetry but from the feel of the pieces. We begin with the most emotional and personal pieces and end with the most universal and abstract. This is our own interpretation of being 'on the water'.</p>
<p><i>I wonder what the woman whose voice is blared through loudspeakers across the country is like herself. I wonder if she's even alive, I wonder how she'd feel knowing her voice announced deaths a dozen times a day in the most loosely veiled code commuters know. I wonder how many voices break a year to her voice.</i></p>
<p>Our illustrator Patryk Wirenski is a Solent alumnus and our Artist in Residence for Illustration at Solent. His illustrations are available in the book, as badges, postcards and prints.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Support</h3>
<p>We need support to produce and distribute this anthology. Our goal is to raise £1,000 to cover costs involved with the production of <i>On the water</i>. We have a range of perks available to those who support us, including badges, posters and postcards and your own copy of <i>On the water </i>of course, for lending us a hand.</p>
<p>Please support our book. Buy one copy for yourself and one copy for a friend!</p>
<p><i>Some said it was a gremlin, some swore it was a beautiful girl, one particularly wise woman thought it was whatever you wanted to see; a shape-shifting phantom with the power to read your deepest emotions. One thing every story had in common however, was that no one could ever actually profess to having witnessed it themselves...</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact of <i>On The Water</i>
</h3>
<p>Waterstones have already told us that the book is one of the best productions they have ever seen...</p>
<p>This is not the first time we've attempted a project like this. Many of the students within the Solent Press unit have produced magazine articles and fanzines. Our staff—namely Dr Matthew Cheeseman and Tom Fowler—are experienced publishers.</p>
<p>Not only are we hoping that <i>On The Water </i>could make an impact on the local literary scene, but we are also aware of how the production of our anthology could have an effect on the environment. For this reason we chose to produce <i>On The Water </i>with vegan-friendly ink printed on recycled paper, to minimize our damage to the environment and to the other animals who share our world.</p>

The book is arranged to take the reader on a journey. It's not organised into sections of prose or poetry but from the feel of the pieces. We begin with the most emotional and personal pieces and end with the most universal and abstract. This is our own interpretation of being 'on the water'.
I wonder what the woman whose voice is blared through loudspeakers across the country is like herself. I wonder if she's even alive, I wonder how she'd feel knowing her voice announced deaths a dozen times a day in the most loosely veiled code commuters know. I wonder how many voices break a year to her voice.
Our illustrator Patryk Wirenski is a Solent alumnus and our Artist in Residence for Illustration at Solent. His illustrations are available in the book, as badges, postcards and prints.

Why We Need Your Support
We need support to produce and distribute this anthology. Our goal is to raise £1,000 to cover costs involved with the production of On the water. We have a range of perks available to those who support us, including badges, posters and postcards and your own copy of On the water of course, for lending us a hand.
Please support our book. Buy one copy for yourself and one copy for a friend!
Some said it was a gremlin, some swore it was a beautiful girl, one particularly wise woman thought it was whatever you wanted to see; a shape-shifting phantom with the power to read your deepest emotions. One thing every story had in common however, was that no one could ever actually profess to having witnessed it themselves...

The Impact of On The Water

Waterstones have already told us that the book is one of the best productions they have ever seen...
This is not the first time we've attempted a project like this. Many of the students within the Solent Press unit have produced magazine articles and fanzines. Our staff—namely Dr Matthew Cheeseman and Tom Fowler—are experienced publishers.
Not only are we hoping that On The Water could make an impact on the local literary scene, but we are also aware of how the production of our anthology could have an effect on the environment. For this reason we chose to produce On The Water with vegan-friendly ink printed on recycled paper, to minimize our damage to the environment and to the other animals who share our world.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Political apps get attention at election time, yet the attention withers away right after - just like interest in politics.  We wanted something to keep people interested at ALL times, especially between elections, when things actually happen. Politics may be boring, complex and downright exhausting, but democracy depends on its citizens remaining engaged at all times. If not, we end up policies and candidates that don’t reflect who we are.Q. What's the significance of the 10,462 number?A. It's the number of unique, registered lobbyists who have actively lobbied in 2016 in Washington DC. Since Underground is effectively a crowd based lobbying platform we’re raising a dollar for every lobbyist on Capital Hill to to take back the control from them, to change the face of our democracy and put the power back in the hands of the people, you!Risks and challengesWell, Democracy could suddenly fix itself, the media could bring honest reporting back and smartphones could become obsolete. Do you see that happening the way things are currently going? We don't either, which is why we are here.Other ways you can helpWe'd love you to be a backer, or you can simply just download the App, record a video or write a comment. No money? No problem.Just spread the word about the Underground Network app or the launch of this campaign -- the last piece of the puzzle. Indiegogo’s share tools make it pretty easy.Stay tuned.

<div>Weslo's Home-O-Erotic Cookbook features Delicious Men preparing Delicious Recipes and shows you, the reader, how to prepare them at home. We have beautiful photography, gorgeous models, witty commentary, stylish design, and of course  very delicious recipes! With over 100 recipes, there's bound to be something for everyone's taste. Our chapters include: Rise and Shine (Breakfast), Afternoon Delight (Lunch), Foreplay (Appetizers), All the Way (Entrees), On the Side (Side Dishes), A Sweet Finish (Dessert), What had Happened was..

<p>For our deluxe edition we will be shooting some big names in Los Angeles. We will need to fly out to LA with our team, rent locations, and pay our talent. Many of the big names we have been talking to are willing to shoot with us for a very modest price, because they love our project and the first edition. Some of these names are musicians, tv and internet personalities, underwear models, and my favorite.. RuPaul Drag Race contestants. </p>
<p>We will also be attending Book Expos and Conventions that put us in front of industry professionals including literary agents, buyers, and press. These are the people that can get our book in major stores all over the world and spread the word much easier than we can with our limited budget. While these contacts are very important to make, some of these trade shows cost as much as $5,000 just for a booth. This is not including flight and hotel expenses.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>By contributing to our campaign you are helping us have our book seen all over the world. Buyers will be able to easily make purchase orders and press who are constantly bombarded with press releases will be able to see what us boys in Texas are making, face to face. The big names we are introducing for our deluxe edition will also give us credibility and no doubt contribute to more sales. </p>
<p>With a very limited budget we have been able to find models, locations, photographers, chefs, and designers to make a beautiful book. Your contribution will help us take this title and deluxe edition to the next level. </p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>We have no shortage of talent: great photography, delicious recipes, gorgeous models, beautiful design, wonderful PR, and so on.. But honestly our biggest challenge we'll be facing this quarter is financial. We have been able to accomplish our first book with a shoe string budget. I think with this experience we will be able to finance our goals with the modest amount we are trying to raise. We are always open to a challenge anyway. We plan on renting an AirBNB where we can stay and shoot our talent in Hollywood during our time there. This will help us minimize our costs while in such an expensive city.

I need at a bare minimum the amount that I have listed on this campaign to keep eating and to get some cover art for my novel. With that first sum of money I can get by long enough to finish my book and get it to you. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This $5000 does not include budgeting for coffee. Just let that sink in. I am willing to go without caffeine to finish my book. An author without caffeine is a sailboat with no wind, but I'll coast my way through that rocky shore because I refuse to give up on this. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Now, anything past $5000 dollars goes straight to caffeine. I'm only mostly kidding. Mostly.

Then some more art for either the cover or the back of the book itself. Honestly you can't have too much art for things like this. And the money will also go to keeping a roof over my head.

<div>If we don't manage to reach our goal however don't fret. The money that you donate will go to the novel and me, and though it will take more time because I'll have to find a second job, I will get it done. It just may take another couple of years. My timeline with funding is to have the book done in six months. </div><div><br/></div>
<div>And with that I make you a simple promise, if you pledge 5 dollars or more, you get the book as soon as I'm done with it. Period. That's the ground floor. Donations past that get a few perks. Nothing too crazy, but a few incentives never hurt right?</div><div><br/></div><div><h3>But what if I have no money?</h3></div><div>For people who can't contribute money there are other options too. If you share my campaign around that always helps. Indiegogo has a ton of tools for that and the more people who view it the better. If you want to suggest things anyway I'll be setting up a forum for that. And if you just want to get your hands on the book if you get your friend to donate $10 I'll give them another copy so you can also have a copy. Or maybe hook me up with a publisher. If any of you do that, well I'm not sure there are enough words to express my gratitude.</div><div><br/></div><div>For those of you who want to contribute but can't immediately don't worry.

If we don't manage to reach our goal however don't fret. The money that you donate will go to the novel and me, and though it will take more time because I'll have to find a second job, I will get it done. It just may take another couple of years. My timeline with funding is to have the book done in six months. 
And with that I make you a simple promise, if you pledge 5 dollars or more, you get the book as soon as I'm done with it. Period. That's the ground floor. Donations past that get a few perks. Nothing too crazy, but a few incentives never hurt right?But what if I have no money?For people who can't contribute money there are other options too. If you share my campaign around that always helps. Indiegogo has a ton of tools for that and the more people who view it the better. If you want to suggest things anyway I'll be setting up a forum for that. And if you just want to get your hands on the book if you get your friend to donate $10 I'll give them another copy so you can also have a copy. Or maybe hook me up with a publisher. If any of you do that, well I'm not sure there are enough words to express my gratitude.For those of you who want to contribute but can't immediately don't worry. The book is going up on a website after I finish it for just $5 digital. You can get it there, or you can continue to contribute after the campaign is finished because Indiegogo is great like that.
_____________And that's it. Contribute if you can, share if you can't. And to everyone who read this all the way through you are an amazing human being. To those who didn't you are only slightly less amazing. Aww, who am I kidding you are all great people. Thanks for your time and consideration. Future author,DCP",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Matthew Ward-Jackson and Matthew Odlum are charged with trafficking weapons that ended up in the hands of Dellen Millard, convicted murderer of  Tim Bosma. </p>
<p>They are pleading not guilty. Originally they were supposed to be tried together at a two-week-long trial is set to begin on May 23, 2017.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Help me to help others.</p>
<p>I've always thought that the secret to life was living long enough to understand it. But, at 77, I now realize that there's a huge chunk about myself that I'll never understand. Like, why was I kidnapped three times? Why did someone hate me enough to have my official birth records burnt by the government? And, why did I have to leave school when I was 14?</p>
<p>Would I change my background? No. Why not? It taught me to hope and put hope deep within me. As well, different people in different times and places helped me. I want to help others who feel life is futile and have no hope. Please lend them a helping hand through supporting the publication of The Temerity of Hope.</p>
<p>The writing is done and most of the revisions but I need your financial help and support for the final push. I've been prayed for all my life and people have died not knowing their prayers were answered. You may never know how important your contribution was or who you helped.The important thing is that if only one person was helped, if one person didn't succumb to the siren call of suicide because of The Temerity of Hope, my life, the hard work of writing and your support will have been worth it.</p>

Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution was converting many from their Christian faith.

In her remote colonial outpost of Sydney, local politics ruled the day. People didn’t particularly care what changes Edward, Prince of Wales, might make to English life when his mother finally died. They were more concerned with the future of their fledgling country. The six Australian colonies were about to amalgamate into one nation. Its future citizens wanted their new constitution to reflect a forward-looking country rather than a colonial past, and vigorous debates were the order of the day as the citizens discussed what their future might be like. The lawmakers looked across the Tasman Sea to a radical New Zealand that allowed its women to vote in parliamentary elections. Not to be outdone, Australia extended the same right to its female citizens in 1901 and went even further, making voting compulsory with significant fines for non-compliance. The Suffragette movement in England could only observe from afar with envy.</p><p>            This was the world into which my grandmother, Evelyn Cunningham, was born in 1893 and the world in which she lived her early life. James, her father worked for a famous brewery’s temperance division. When Evelyn was born, the family lived in Redfern, a notorious inner-city suburb of Sydney. As the second oldest in the family, she was expected to help Olive, her elder sister, with the younger children and together they took over the management of the house during their mother’s frequent pregnancies. Both girls probably missed a lot of school as a result and, although education was prized in the family, neither went to high school.</p><p>The new constitution emboldened Australia, so that when Britain went to war in 1914, men immediately enlisted in the Australian Army Corps, motivated not so much by the desire to defend England, but by the necessity to prove their nationhood on the world stage. Like all Australians, Evelyn was shocked by the horrific death and casualty rates suffered by the new army at Gallipoli in the Dardanelles, and then later in France. However, an exciting development in her life dulled the pain and worry of wartime because a young man, Victor Lionel Thorsen, had begun courting her.</p><p>The Thorsen family had emigrated from Denmark in the 1850s, settling first in the Maryborough district of Queensland and moving to the inner west of Sydney shortly after Lionel was born, the fourth of nine children, in the 1890s. Lionel was popular, attracting friends like a magnet. He had the most amazing knowledge and asked questions about things nobody else thought about.</p><p>One afternoon in 1915, Lionel took Evelyn to a library and showed her pictures of famous artists’ works. Time and again he returned to one book, telling her to look at the portraits. She dutifully studied them, choosing one of a girl with a blue and white headscarf and a pearl earing as her favourite. She left the library thinking that all the houses in the book had black and white tiled floors exactly like those in her father’s new house in the northern suburb of Hornsby. Just before they said goodbye, she told Lionel about this similarity. He laughed. “If I had all the money in the world, I’d take us to Holland, and we’d go to that artist, and I’d beg on my knees for a chance to learn from him.”</p><p>            “Vermeer is dead, Lionel,” my pragmatic grandmother scoffed.</p><p>            “I know, and I know it’s only a dream. But I keep wondering if time could ever be elastic, and if it was maybe I <i>could</i> study under Vermeer,” he replied.</p><p>            Another time he took her for a great treat – day tripping across Sydney Harbour to Manly Beach with a few of their friends. On the way back, he manoeuvred things so that they were alone on the ferry’s outside deck. On the pretext of protecting her from the wind, he pulled her close to him and then pointed to the sky. “See the Southern Cross?”</p><p>            After Evelyn pointed it out, he told her the names of the main stars -- Acrux. Becrux. Gacrux and Delta Crucis. This was typical Lionel, knowing all sorts of obscure information, but he became pure Lionel when he added, “Do you know that Jesus probably saw them too? From what I’ve read, astronomers lost the Cross for hundreds of years and then found it in our hemisphere. Funny, isn’t it? First it was north and now it’s our southern icon.”</p><p>            That was exactly what she loved most about Lionel. Although he knew the most interesting bits of information, he didn’t go on about them like some other people. He just said things and left her to think them over.  Then, as the ferry ploughed it way through the heavy swells guarding the entrance to Sydney Harbour, Lionel tugged her even closer. “In Job, God talks about a time when the morning stars sang together.”</p><p>            “But, there’s only one morning star,” Evelyn protested.</p><p>            “That’s true now,” Lionel said. “But think, Evie. Dream a little. If the Southern Cross used to be a northern cross, surely things aren’t necessarily as black and white as those tiled floors. Things change. God says there was a time when morning stars sang together and angels shouted for joy. Wouldn’t it have been wonderful? To see singing stars and everyone shouting for joy? I wish for that even more than the chance of learning from Vermeer.” They sat in silence with Evelyn imaging the wonder of singing stars and joyous shouts until Lionel whispered, “You’re the star that brings me joy. Shall I stand right now and shout it across the harbour?”</p></div>","Short Summary

Her first book was Empowered Health and Wellness: awakening your inner physician. Her two children's books are Hindy Hedgehog's Magical Garden which teaches children how to connect with their inner physician and Mocha Mouse Creates a Magical Day, teaches children about the law of attraction.</p><p>Are you interested in alternative medicine and innovative ways to heal?  Empowered Health and Wellness is loaded with alternative methods that Katelyn used personally to heal.  </p><p>Here is a professional review of her first book, Empowered Health and Wellness, to give you a flavor of her writing:</p><p>Professional review:<br/>""The author’s impressive knowledge in health and wellness impresses, particularly given the vast amount of fresh material provided in spiritual elements. I found myself turning pages left and right, impressed by so many new-to-me facts and insights. It’s a beautiful thought on page 7 – so impressive at the start of this book and deepening the immersion the already-impressed reader feels: ‘what if every illness has an angel attached to it?’ Readers who are currently caring for a sick loved one, or battling an illness themselves, will take great comfort in this idea. Beautifully done. The book is very well organized, with complex concepts broken down into manageable snippets, and we’re treated in between to great quotes. Well done. I loved it that the author had the excellent instinct to save her own personal stories until after she welcomed the reader into the book with instructional and inspirational material. It’s a mark of writing maturity not to want to jump right into ‘my story.’ Well done. The ‘woe’ vs. ‘whoa’ part made me smile. There is a lot to love about this book, including health facts that show the author’s expertise and dedication to building a multifaceted book filled with helpful information and a solid guide into better living.""</p><p> You can find her books at <a href=""http://www.mystickcreekpublishing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mystickcreekpublishing.com</a> She is also the author of a best selling children's game called Angry Animals and Angry Animals 2, which teaches the healthy expression of anger using art, play, roll play and other techniques.  Katelyn was a psychologist for 26 years working with children and their families from all walks of life.

I knew from the beginning of this triple heart transformation that I was not only taking this journey for myself but I was doing it for many others and those people where in my mind all the time.</p><p>I was outraged when I learned that<strong> 80% of all heart disease and heart attacks are preventable</strong>…PREVENTABLE!!!  I heard that and I was determined to discover how to prevent it for me and you.</p><p>I was furious when I discovered that what caused my heart attacks, elevated Lipoprotein (a), <strong>wasn’t even tested or treated in the US because there isn’t a pharmaceutical to treat it.</strong> Bob Harper from Biggest Loser almost died from the same thing. I learned it wasn't treated or tested here directly from my doctors who argued with me on many occasions because I wouldn’t take the pharmaceutical of choice and chose to go the natural way. They never told my about the risks from having elevated Lipoprotein(a) I had to discover it on my own.</p><p>I learned about elevated Lipoprotein (a) by accident before I even knew I had it.   60 million people have this issue in the US, or 1 in 5 and many are dropping dead because they don’t even know they have it or because their doctor isn’t treating it! Damn that makes me angry! I have had close friends drop dead from heart attacks and to think they might not have had to.  Normal Lipoprotein (a) is below 30.  When I had my first reading it was 110!  I discovered how to successfully treat elevated Lipoprotein(a) through my own research and I also share that in the book.</p><p>High cholesterol isn’t the issue in the heart disease paradigm but that is what doctors treat in everyone who has a heart attack/heart disease because there IS a pharmaceutical that might work for some. In fact if you have a heart attack you get the 5 pill protocol no matter who you are. There isn't a one size fits all solution and many people have adverse reactions to those 5 medications.  I was one of them.</p><p>I feel blessed to be alive!  I not only got a second chance  but a third, and fourth chance to live and make a difference!! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503086365/uru8gtfgxvkl8a13ifkv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>I learned SO much about healing your heart and having a healthy heart so you can avoid having issues and I share all the secrets in <strong>Resilient Heart.

I was healthy, ate healthy food and had worked on personal development for years. I had no warning when I had the first heart attack on March 20, 2016, which was caused by a fire in my dryer.  That fire turned into a blessing because that uncovered the issue that was happening in my arteries. I had the second heart attack in Austria and was hospitalized for a week in a hospital where 95% of the people didn’t speak English. That by itself taught me a lot. The third heart attack happened January 2017.  All three of them were the result of elevated Lipoprotein (a) and I tell these transformational stories and how I healed my heart in <strong>Resilient Heart</strong> along with techniques for you can use to strengthen, enhance your health and open your heart.</p><p>The same thing that happened to me happened to Bob Harper of the Biggest Loser. Talk about healthy and in great shape. Lipoprotein(a) doesn't discriminate. Healthy, not healthy, young and old. It happens to anyone. And NO one is telling us!!! I am changing that. I am telling everyone! </p><p>The importance of this mission wasn’t lost on me and through my own transformation and healing I found pearls that will help you!  That is the kind of deep sea diving I like!

Her two children's books are Hindy Hedgehog's Magical Garden which teaches children how to connect with their inner physician and Mocha Mouse Creates a Magical Day, teaches children about the law of attraction.Are you interested in alternative medicine and innovative ways to heal?  Empowered Health and Wellness is loaded with alternative methods that Katelyn used personally to heal.  Here is a professional review of her first book, Empowered Health and Wellness, to give you a flavor of her writing:Professional review:""The author’s impressive knowledge in health and wellness impresses, particularly given the vast amount of fresh material provided in spiritual elements. I found myself turning pages left and right, impressed by so many new-to-me facts and insights. It’s a beautiful thought on page 7 – so impressive at the start of this book and deepening the immersion the already-impressed reader feels: ‘what if every illness has an angel attached to it?’ Readers who are currently caring for a sick loved one, or battling an illness themselves, will take great comfort in this idea. Beautifully done. The book is very well organized, with complex concepts broken down into manageable snippets, and we’re treated in between to great quotes. Well done. I loved it that the author had the excellent instinct to save her own personal stories until after she welcomed the reader into the book with instructional and inspirational material. It’s a mark of writing maturity not to want to jump right into ‘my story.’ Well done. The ‘woe’ vs. ‘whoa’ part made me smile. There is a lot to love about this book, including health facts that show the author’s expertise and dedication to building a multifaceted book filled with helpful information and a solid guide into better living."" You can find her books at http://www.mystickcreekpublishing.com She is also the author of a best selling children's game called Angry Animals and Angry Animals 2, which teaches the healthy expression of anger using art, play, roll play and other techniques.  Katelyn was a psychologist for 26 years working with children and their families from all walks of life. She is also a visionary artist.  She has been an entrepreneur since she was in her early 20's.Why is this important to me They say that if your why doesn’t make you cry, it isn’t big enough.  This WHY brings tears to my eyes every time I talk about it!I had to have 3 heart attacks, in ten months, to learn everything there was to learn about the heart, on the body, mind and spirit level.  I learned so much about having a healthy heart and how to avoid heart issues that I feel compelled to share it. I knew from the beginning of this triple heart transformation that I was not only taking this journey for myself but I was doing it for many others and those people where in my mind all the time.I was outraged when I learned that 80% of all heart disease and heart attacks are preventable…PREVENTABLE!!!  I heard that and I was determined to discover how to prevent it for me and you.I was furious when I discovered that what caused my heart attacks, elevated Lipoprotein (a), wasn’t even tested or treated in the US because there isn’t a pharmaceutical to treat it. Bob Harper from Biggest Loser almost died from the same thing. I learned it wasn't treated or tested here directly from my doctors who argued with me on many occasions because I wouldn’t take the pharmaceutical of choice and chose to go the natural way. They never told my about the risks from having elevated Lipoprotein(a) I had to discover it on my own.I learned about elevated Lipoprotein (a) by accident before I even knew I had it.   60 million people have this issue in the US, or 1 in 5 and many are dropping dead because they don’t even know they have it or because their doctor isn’t treating it! Damn that makes me angry! I have had close friends drop dead from heart attacks and to think they might not have had to.  Normal Lipoprotein (a) is below 30.  When I had my first reading it was 110!  I discovered how to successfully treat elevated Lipoprotein(a) through my own research and I also share that in the book.High cholesterol isn’t the issue in the heart disease paradigm but that is what doctors treat in everyone who has a heart attack/heart disease because there IS a pharmaceutical that might work for some. In fact if you have a heart attack you get the 5 pill protocol no matter who you are. There isn't a one size fits all solution and many people have adverse reactions to those 5 medications.  I was one of them.I feel blessed to be alive!  I not only got a second chance  but a third, and fourth chance to live and make a difference!! I learned SO much about healing your heart and having a healthy heart so you can avoid having issues and I share all the secrets in Resilient Heart. This isn't a dreary book about heart disease but an uplifting book about prevention and living a healthy life. I know how to heal my body and I want to teach other people how.  I want to make alternative solutions for a healthy heart available to everyone.  I want to be part of the solution to wiping out heart disease and my book and subsequent products will help make that happen!I am writing this book to help anyone, whether you suffer from heart issues or you want to maintain a healthy heart.  This book will support you to do both.Benefits to the reader of Resilient Heart: *Learn about nutrition that will support heart health*Learn about prevention strategies.*Discover techniques that support health and Wellness *Learn about resilience and perseverance and miracles through Katelyn's story*Learn about information that the medical field isn't telling you that can save your life*Learn about heart health on the physical, spiritual, emotional level*Learn what the experts are saying about heart health*Find resources for heart healthLet's Start Saving Hearts!My story, the short versionOne would think that someone who had 3 heart attacks over 10 months must be unhealthy.  That wasn’t true of me. I was healthy, ate healthy food and had worked on personal development for years. I had no warning when I had the first heart attack on March 20, 2016, which was caused by a fire in my dryer.  That fire turned into a blessing because that uncovered the issue that was happening in my arteries. I had the second heart attack in Austria and was hospitalized for a week in a hospital where 95% of the people didn’t speak English. That by itself taught me a lot. The third heart attack happened January 2017.  All three of them were the result of elevated Lipoprotein (a) and I tell these transformational stories and how I healed my heart in Resilient Heart along with techniques for you can use to strengthen, enhance your health and open your heart.The same thing that happened to me happened to Bob Harper of the Biggest Loser. Talk about healthy and in great shape. Lipoprotein(a) doesn't discriminate. Healthy, not healthy, young and old. It happens to anyone. And NO one is telling us!!! I am changing that. I am telling everyone! The importance of this mission wasn’t lost on me and through my own transformation and healing I found pearls that will help you!  That is the kind of deep sea diving I like! It made this difficult journey worth it for me.Watch the video to hear one of the miracles that happened to me in this process.Why do I need help to launch this book? This is an important book and this information needs to be out there now.  People are dying from heart attacks and heart disease everyday.  They are our friends and family members.  I discovered things through my journey that will help them and help anyone have a healthier heart.  The time is now.

<h2><strong>The Responsive “Thin is a Thought” Weight Loss System</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Slim down and improve your life by changing your automatic thought patterns</strong></h3>
<p>Self-paced audio program by best-selling author <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H5ZHMBC/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jeff Kooz</a></p>
<p>~</p>
<p><strong>Did you know that one in five US deaths is associated with obesity?</strong></p>
<p>It's true. One in five people in the US die prematurely (from obesity-related diseases including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, liver disease, cancer, and more).</p>
<p><strong>And the worst part of this …</strong></p>
<p>Many of these people are not lazy; in fact, they’re desperately trying to reverse the problem.</p>
<p><strong>How?</strong></p>
<p>Through a 61 billion-dollar industry replete with drugs, gyms, health equipment, diets and diet programs, and the list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>For many, this works … but FOR SO MANY OTHERS it doesn’t.</strong></p>
<p>I know because I’ve been there.</p>
<p>For 10 years I tried dozens of diets and worked out a total of (brace yourself) 5,000+ hours.</p>
<p>However, after some initial results, I typically ended up in the same boat, or even worse.</p>
<p><strong>A 97% fail rate</strong></p>
<p>As it turns out, I wasn’t alone. A little research shows that diets typically succumb to a statistical 95% fail rate, and new research shows the figure is more accurately 97%.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Shame. Silent Killer</strong></p>
<p><i>So, how does this make you feel?  </i></p>
<p>Frustrated.</p>
<p>I know from first-hand experience – the sinking, silent shame of feeling hopeless, like you’ve “failed,” and let yourself (and others) down.  </p>
<p>And yet, beyond the silent shame lies an even greater ill – the silent killer of obesity-related illness.</p>
<p><strong>But I found a way out – and NOT through traditional prescriptions.</strong></p>
<p>One day I realized something fascinating: despite the vast sea of weight loss solutions, we hardly EVER hear about the mind, and yet the mind (particularly our subconscious mind) is where so many of our habitual behaviors originate.</p>
<p>It dawned on me that my mind was like a computer, storing programs infused by social conditioning, which I wasn’t even aware of.</p>
<p>The “push-button” and ""instant gratification"" messaging I'd absorbed culturally made it nearly impossible to change my behavior.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I learned how to reprogram my mind, and for the first time in my life, eating in a balanced, enjoyable way seemed easy! </p>
<p>And weight loss was really one of many healthy, automatic, bi-products.  </p>
<p><i>&gt;&gt; It’s my mission to help others learn this method through an innovative set of self-paced audio recordings!&lt;&lt;</i></p>
<p><strong>Initial pilot testers (spring 2017) testimonials:</strong></p>
<p>“Thank you so much! Your method helped me uncover some new insights into why the maintenance phase after successfully losing weight has always been such a failure.” Marie Clappsaddle  </p>
<p>“Your step by step system is helpful in organizing your thoughts to getting where you want/need to go in life. It helped me clearly realize my health goals and it clearly outlined achievable ways to reach them.” Cathy Parthan </p>
<p> “Your system reminds me 7 Habits, One Minute Manager and The Secret in one. I’m amazed at how much wisdom you packed into it.”  Gary Graham</p>

Did you know that one in five US deaths is associated with obesity?
It's true. One in five people in the US die prematurely (from obesity-related diseases including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, liver disease, cancer, and more).
And the worst part of this …
Many of these people are not lazy; in fact, they’re desperately trying to reverse the problem.
How?
Through a 61 billion-dollar industry replete with drugs, gyms, health equipment, diets and diet programs, and the list goes on.
For many, this works … but FOR SO MANY OTHERS it doesn’t.
I know because I’ve been there.
For 10 years I tried dozens of diets and worked out a total of (brace yourself) 5,000+ hours.
However, after some initial results, I typically ended up in the same boat, or even worse.
A 97% fail rate
As it turns out, I wasn’t alone. A little research shows that diets typically succumb to a statistical 95% fail rate, and new research shows the figure is more accurately 97%.
Silent Shame. Silent Killer
So, how does this make you feel?  
Frustrated.
I know from first-hand experience – the sinking, silent shame of feeling hopeless, like you’ve “failed,” and let yourself (and others) down.  
And yet, beyond the silent shame lies an even greater ill – the silent killer of obesity-related illness.
But I found a way out – and NOT through traditional prescriptions.
One day I realized something fascinating: despite the vast sea of weight loss solutions, we hardly EVER hear about the mind, and yet the mind (particularly our subconscious mind) is where so many of our habitual behaviors originate.
It dawned on me that my mind was like a computer, storing programs infused by social conditioning, which I wasn’t even aware of.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The planet, life on this only planet we know of which supports life, is facing great challenges and stresses at the hands of humankind.  Humans in this global culture know many of the causes, but only speak of ""reducing"" fossil fuel emissions and other hyperabundant pollution which techno-industrial global society produces to maintain what are considered the minimum requirements of civilization.  Carbon dioxide, methane and other forms of pollution, meanwhile, increase each year despite promises and goals to ""reduce"" what must actually be discontinued for the planet to avoid extreme changes already occurring, already damaging life and its future prospects.  Today's humans are flattening global forests, overfishing the oceans, driving myriad species extinct, daily.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Humans once lived within the boundaries of the ecosystems that support life; those cultures which did not live within nature's boundaries (Easter Island, the Mayan civilization) disappeared.  Those cultures which lasted tens of thousands of years without overshooting the carrying capacity of the land they lived upon, and what the land provided them to continue living, had stories which taught each succeeding generation to fundamentally respect, hold and treat as sacred the land and life around them, grateful for the sacred privilege of life and understanding their own place as co-existent strands within the fabric of life.  These peoples did not see themselves as ""separate from,"" ""above"" nature and the life they saw about them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We call the stories of these peoples ""myths,"" frequently with a condescending tone and underlying intent.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Today's techno-industrial humanity, which William R. Catton, Jr. called ""Homo Colossus"" in his important book <i>Overshoot</i>, do not even see the myths currently driving them (us) to destroy that which makes life on this planet possible, as quickly as its ever-""improving"" machines can accomplish the task.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We need new stories.  We need New Myths, more like those of former (and still existing here and there upon the planet) humans.  We need those ancient stories, told in a way that today's humanity, those of us concerned for A Future, can reshape the destiny currently mapped-out and inexorable, unless we can imagine and pursue a new (ancient) path.  To even see that path, we need stories which point the way, and affect the actions we take, the beliefs we hold.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Humans love stories.  They are fundamental to who we are, how we see the world, ourselves, and our place within the world and life.  You might say, to use a techno-industrial metaphor, that they contain our operating system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">New Myths Press has its own origin story<span>.  I know we live in a sound-byte, YouTube, Twitter-pated world in which few have the time to read more than 140 characters about something new, so I have included a </span><b>Who? What? Where? When?

<span>New Myths Press is also </span><span>seeking others, readers and writers, poets and novelists, essayists and speakers, all who are passionately committed to the search for and creation of New (and Ancient) Stories, new ways of seeing the world and our place in it, living with instead of at the expense of the planet’s living systems.</span>
</div><p> </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this campaign, your participation will help fund the rollout and marketing of three excellent writers in their first New Myths Press collaborations.  Adebayo Akomolafe is a Professor,  an international speaker, essayist and spiritual adventurer, questioning preconceptions and bending consciousness into a primal, direct-experiencing.  He offers counterintuitive wisdom such as:  “The times are urgent; let us  slow down.”  Jason Hine writes compassionate, powerful “alternative” sermons, frequently as short as a single paragraph, also several paragraphs and pages in length, all of which speak directly to the heart, releasing anxieties and evoking purpose, empathy, sacred attention and active participation in the birthing of a More Beautiful World.  Aliani Shahbano is a modern Sufi poet, distilling the passions of sacred Love and inspiring readers to attention and the presence of sacred beauty and Love in their own daily lives and smallest moments.  These are poems to read and re-read, to share and savor.  Aliani provides contextual introductions to each section of her collection, drawing a comparative  connection to the celebrated lineage her poetry belongs within: that of Rumi, and generations of sacred poets since.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The campaign will also support the rollout and marketing of the newly revised and edited edition of Zack Lehtinen’s novel <i>World of Wounds.</i>  All who previously contributed to the crowdfunding campaign for that novel, or who have purchased <i>World of Wounds </i>in its existing form, will receive their chosen contribution “perks”  for this campaign,  and will also receive a signed copy of the newly-revised edition of the novel <i>World of Wounds</i>, regardless of the level of contribution.  You only have to ask.</p><h2><b>What?</b></h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">New Myths Press:  an independent, print-on-demand imprint collaborating to create attractive trade-paperback and Kindle eBooks.  New Myths publishes novels, collections of essays, poetry, speeches, stories and transcribed interviews/ conversations, and is open to publishing other types of writing as well.  All have in common the commitment to enVisioning ways of living in alignment with this one planet we share, seeking paradigms beyond what Charles Eisenstein has called the “space between stories” where many of us currently  reside:  the old, destructive, still-commonplace stories of infinite growth on a finite, deeply damaged planet, myths of techno-industrial utopian Progress, habits of seeing the earth and its beauties, its habitats and provisions as “resources” to exploit, even if that means polluting earth, air and oceans, razing ecosystems, driving species to extinction and compromising our own children’s ability to live on a survivable planet, much-less to thrive; and the necessary New (Ancient) Stories which embrace the beauty, resilience and sacred privilege of our place as humans, shared voices in the chorus of life, not disconnected, hubristic Masters and Conquerors of  the earth.  We have the ability, option, the sacred Privilege to live as a timeless dance with the beautiful world we have been born-into; but we require New (Ancient) Stories, new Myths, magical and sacred ways of seeing our relationship with our fellow-travelers, because the Core Stories currently being lived into existence have taken humanity and all life on this planet to a dangerous, existential brink. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Stories have brought us here, and fuel the tremendous momentum of destruction which cannot be denied, and cannot be transcended from within the same stories.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As Albert  Einstein famously  said, “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”  This simple truth is also profound, and points squarely to our culture’s core Myths.  Some might say, “Myths?  Those are ancient stories of magic, of pagan Gods, indigenous peoples and ignorant, pre-scientific times, fables and origin stories disconnected from what progress and scientific inquiry have allowed us to access in these post-Enlightenment times.”  Many cannot see, are too ensconced within the fluid of the stories they are swimming in to even acknowledge or understand that they ARE stories—they are today’s myths.  Myths of techno-industrial limitless growth and constant progress, myths of human control over the planet, a myth (to give just one specific example) which says that because our species “discovered” how to split atomic particles, that gives us the right to inflict the mass-destruction of nuclear chain reactions upon fellow human beings and other living things, to “harness” the energy of split atoms without any effective plan to protect the future from the radioactive “waste” such energy “production” manufactures…  And speaking of waste: current myths  tell us that it is a “normal” side-effect of being human to dump mountains of non-degradable plastics into the oceans, to heap carbon, methane and dioxin, synthetic “man-made” chemicals and genetically-modified life-forms  into the air and soil, water and biosphere, where their consequences are widespread, devastating and frequently last centuries in their destructive, disruptive potential.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">These are stories our culture tells itself, and these underlying stories support the continuing onslaught, fuel the attitudes and rationalizations which allow us to see wanton destruction of the capacity for life as the normal “business of life.” </p><p>We need new stories—New (Ancient) Myths.</p><p>New Myths Press is dedicated to finding, to collaborating with creators of  stories, those able to envision and describe paradigms of understanding and action required for A Future, and to sharing their writings  with you.</p><h2><b>Where?</b></h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Distribution and participation are international.  New Myths Press titles are available anywhere Amazon operates (thus, can also be ordered by most physical bookstores upon request), anywhere Kindle books can be ordered and accessed.  Many New Myths Press writings will even be available free, online, but we are producing attractive trade-paperback volumes and Kindle eBooks, as affordable as we can make them, because we want you to be able to have these writings in your permanent library, available to read and re-read, share and gift.  New Myths contributors span the planet already—from the U.S. to Nigeria, from Pakistan to the U.K.—and we plan to expand this trend as we grow our community of Visionaries and eccentric communicators of unseen paradigms unfolding in our midst already, but invisible until enunciated.</p><h2><b>When?</b></h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As we initiate this IndieGogo campaign, the writing described above is written, collected, being fine-tuned and edited, and should be ready for publication by the completion of the crowdfunding campaign in 40 days, or very soon thereafter.  Our goal is to publish by or before the second week in May, and by the end of this IndieGogo campaign we will likely have the publication date established and available.</p><h2>Why?</h2><p><i><b>For A Future.</b></i></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>Breakdown of how funds will be spent:</b></h2><p><b>$1,000</b> to establish an SEO campaign using AdEdge online marketing, Westport, CT, including ad designs and upgrade to website and social media presence/ appearance/ effectiveness.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have done my research, and AdEdge is the best at what it does: they are expert at leveraging the advanced tools of SEO (search engine optimization online), targeting online marketing, in compelling but non-invasive ways, using the latest and best tools of GoogleAds, Facebook and social media generally, making sure the ads we use, our website and social media pages are designed and placed to attract those seeking exactly this sort of ""product.""  The expansion of New Myths Press will be in the best of hands; your contribution will make the greatest difference possible in spreading this endeavor, these great writers and their urgent words, without access to a large publisher's budget and marketing department.  </p><p><b>$500</b> for a targeted online marketing campaign using AdEdge online marketing.</p><p><b>$500</b> for a targeted, specialized social media campaign using AdEdge online marketing.</p><p><b>$300/ month, first 12 months</b> of ongoing online marketing costs:  <b>$3,600</b></p><p><b>$50</b> for review/ promotion services from Serious Reading:<b>  <a href=""serious%20reading.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">serious reading.com</a></b></p><p><b>$250 </b>for business expenses, startup</p><p><b>$500</b> for readings/appearances by New Myths Press writers</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>This totals $6,400</b>, an amount which will establish New Myths Press with all initial advertising and marketing costs for an independent launch campaign, lasting nearly a year in which the Press can establish itself, advertise its authors, expand awareness of this essential offering.  If we do not reach this goal, we will use the funds in as effective and targeted a way possible to maximize and expand existing social media and online presence, upgrading and launching the New Myths Press website and whatever GoogleAds funding achieved will allow us to make and place.  If we exceed this funding goal, all funds will go into further marketing and expansion efforts of New Myths Press, to promote the writers current and future who contribute to its crucial mission of providing urgently needed New (Ancient) Myths-- for A Future.</p><p> </p><h2><b>Your Contribution</b></h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">New Myths Press has reached a key state of potential to grow-into, to identify  and communicate with  its ideal audience.  We will continue finding and publishing  essential writings,  introducing more international contributors into the New Myths Press canon.  Adebayo, Jason and Aliani are exciting, richly expressive, rewarding writers who have demonstrated ongoing commitment to playing their parts in ushering-in the More Beautiful World our hearts imagine and hope to co-create. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Your contribution, even of the smallest pledge-amount, will play a key, very direct role in allowing New Myths Press to expand the readership these writers deserve, as well as providing an empowering platform for bringing new writers to the attention of those seeking this sort of writing:  urgent, beautiful voices writing their hearts’ vision for A Future.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> New Myths Press will continue gathering an impressive cadre of further writers, poets, storytellers and philosophers, those whose words open New (Ancient) vistas of planetary healing and, just possibly, a thriving future rather than the one currently being approached headlong at maximum velocity.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Supporting New Myths Press is an investment in a better Future for our kids and future generations.  They will need new stories to get through difficult times already encroaching—New Myths to frame the struggle of constructing a More Beautiful World.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">THANK YOU for your contribution!  These writers have created beautiful, urgent, vital writing—they deserve a large, appreciative audience.  This campaign represents a commitment to expand that audience with all the targeted, customized power that a well-designed, professional online advertising and social media campaign can provide.  If we make less than our target amount, we will economize the effort with the same intention and pursuit; the compelling opportunity of reaching or exceeding our fundraising goal is that these writers, and the expansion of New Myths Press, will have the opportunity to expand just at the moment that these exciting, important international voices are published.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Support these writers.  Support the search for the New (Ancient) Stories our damaged world needs, which our children and future generations can benefit from our having brought-into the world..  Stories, poems, speeches, essays, sacred insights from everyday people who have tapped-into their concerns, their gift for words, their deepest, most honest and authentic expression of what will be required of our human generation.</p><p><b>New Myths:  for A Future.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>A few related links, resonant and inspiring to the New Myths Press vision and mission:</b></p><p><span>Manish Jain:  <a href=""http://schoolingtheworld.org/people/manish/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://schoolingtheworld.org/people/manish/</a></span></p><p>Charles Eisenstein:   <a href=""http://charleseisenstein.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://charleseisenstein.net</a></p><p>A characteristically powerful, insightful video of Charles speaking-- highly resonant with New Myths Press's vision and mission:  <a href=""http://charleseisenstein.net/project/story-disruption-morphogenesis-2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://charleseisenstein.net/project/story-disruption-morphogenesis-2015/</a></p><p><span>William Catton Jr., <i style=""text-align: center;"">Overshoot</i><span style=""text-align: center;"">:  </span><a href=""http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/34144.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-align: center;"" target=""_blank"">William R.

<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: center;"">Were others not concerned?  </p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">Aside from the havoc of pollution, climate chaos, and the “nuclear genie,” I learned in the decade since my daughter’s birth about peak oil, predicted by then-prominent oil geologist Marion Hubbert in the 1950s, and peak Everything (metals, minerals, “resources” of every stripe), accurately forecast in the early 1970s by the original Club of Rome <i>Limits to Growth</i> report.  These predicted peaks are all manifesting, as mainstream and full-on denialist media, politicians and (especially) economists condescendingly deny and ignore their clear signs and cratering effects on the global economy.  As they rapidly approach the point of irreversible undeniability, financial collapse looks likely to be the first “shot across the bow” which shocks many clinging to still-ubiquitous delusions of techno-utopia and limitless growth into an unwilling, likely devastating and worldview-shattering, “unexpected” paradigm of unremitting—well, Less.<br/></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">However, and however rapidly, the impending shifts tumble forth upon us, it will be uncomfortable and paradigm-crushing for many.  Most still believe, no matter what their awareness or degree of concern, that “They'll think of something,” that the middle class lifestyle that many (though a significant minority, globally) have grown accustomed to will inexorably, inevitably continue, that these problems will, of course, be solved, and “those (evil) people” must and will  be overcome, but that “our standard of living” can and certainly will be protected and sustained, is sacrosanct and inevitable…</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">The phrases and terms above in quotes, and the many similar words and phrases commonplace today, are mirrored shards of this world’s myths, and even those of us not deep in belligerent, bellicose denial about the existence (much less depth) of the myriad problems and challenges facing us and the planet our species is squeezing tend to live as though the central Myth, as battered and compromised as it is and seems at times, is ultimately true:  the Myth of Progress.  “Whatever stumbles occur  and obstacles obstruct, however much the trajectory seems one step forward and two steps back, We are on a Path Toward Progress, ever upward, to the stars and beyond,” says this core myth.  “If fossil fuels become scarce [too expensive to remain ubiquitous], and pollute too much, we will switch to solar and wind to power our homes and trips to the strip malls and our commute to our cubicles”…  But fossil fuels are a very, uniquely concentrated form of energy, and are used for far more than just electrifying homes and getting to work. </p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">Pollution and climate change are looming, major threats, and humans have already proven committed (by actions, and lack thereof) to the Too Little, Too Late path as far as any serious address of these and so many related issues and problems—eradication of forests and species, fisheries and ocean life, rampant desertification, drought and accompanying crop failures and famine—problems related to each other inasmuch as they all tie-in to the core stories and worldview which allow us to see humans, civilized techno-industrial humans in particular, as separate and above the earth’s life forms and that which we define as “resources.”  The techno-industrial  worldview, stories, underlying agreements, many unspoken, about what is important, what goals to pursue, about participants’ purpose in life and the meaning gleaned from existence, these have a primary significance and impact upon our actions and attitudes as a species, as global techno-industrial civilization.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">It was in coming to this conclusion that I had my own personal “a-ha!” moment.  Not that I saw myself as so important and wise as to be able to single-handedly make any significant shift in the momentum of destruction of “our” culture, but the epiphany allowed me to shift from despondency and a sense of futility, a sense that many commonplace forms of protest and activism have been ineffective and somehow “not it,” to a sense of identifying a powerful force within the core of us all, a seemingly unrelated but highly significant aspect of what allows and causes humanity to be so destructive, and heedless of the wastelands in our wake:  our Core Stories move us to do these things, and both motivate and justify our destructive activities, from war and colonial/cultural genocide to the outright destruction of vast swaths of the landscape which destroy habitats and drive countless species extinct. </p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">The Myths of Progress and Endless Growth are pervasive yet subtle.  They are a modern extension of the idea of Manifest Destiny, but we can look back with historic detachment upon those two words and their underlying beliefs with some distance and disapproval, whereas most today have no such perspective on the rigidity and staunch Faith wrapped up in the ideas of constant, ever-increasing Progress and economic Growth which most embrace today as unquestionable Truth.  Most today would not describe or accept a definition of these terms as “beliefs,” and don't accept that there is any way around the harm being done to the planet, if an alternative meant an end to, much-less a reversal of, economic growth or constant technological Progress.  Just as slavery seemed inevitable, normal and was justified in its time and context, continuing extraction of millions of barrels of substances which contribute to making the planet unfit for living things currently alive on the planet, possibly including our own species, is not seen as negotiable.  Even those who “oppose fossil fuels,” many of us, most of us, still drive cars, fly in planes, use roads and plastics and heat our homes using the energy of burned carbon.  We still use and require money, work in jobs to earn that money, and use the resources our culture and its stories make available to us, day-to-day, minute by minute.<br/></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">It really hit me how influential these underlying stories are, how entwined they are with the actions, beliefs and routines of our lives.  We live IN our stories; our stories PREVENT us from taking different courses of action, however much we might oppose the harm done by those very actions.  Another aspect of story-centrality to how we relate to (or fail to) the consequences of living-out these stories is that, for those of us opposed to the idea of imposing these consequences on our children and those yet-unborn (much-less ourselves, already, Now), a consistent way to see the problems and their consequences is in terms of an Evil Enemy who is responsible and must be opposed, must be stopped.  We must Fight, we must Battle, we must Oppose the forces of Evil!  Whether we see corporate CEOs as evil, or politicians (or politicians of the Other party), or oil companies, or chemical or agribusiness or banking and finance companies; whether Wall Street or Hollywood or the Military Industrial Complex or Organized Religion—when we portray any or all of these Others as those Responsible, as those inhuman, callous and self-interested enough to have Caused the problems we wish didn't exist, we create the aggressive, dualistic, oppositional energy which tends merely to exacerbate existing problems, and which fails to take into account the mirror.  Enemies are central players in all conventional stories; battling and overcoming enemies is the way we see “our” stories—it is, though, an important reason we new new types of stories, in which endless conflict and blame and scapegoating are not the pervasive features, ineffective in laying-out new paradigms which will be necessary to have a chance of moving beyond current culture’s destructiveness.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">A lifelong creative, with hands-on experience and university/ professional-level training in numerous forms of art and performance, my most consistent, lifelong creative outlet and through-line has been my love of writing.  My university BA is in English; I have written poetry since high school, consistently; I have written a one-act play which has been performed in America and at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland; I have written multiple feature-length screenplays, one of which was independently produced; I have written and self-published a book on alternative education. </p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">I have also written stories, and written a few individual episodes of memoir—but over the years, I had only glanced (""too busy!""—<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">aren't we all?) at the notion of writing a novel. </span></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">I didn't kid myself that writing one novel was going to “save the world”—but my epiphanies about the centrality and pervasiveness of our culture’s stories to how we see, and crucially, to how we act in and upon the world, made me realize that I wanted to intentionally write with New Stories, New Myths in mind.  I began writing the novel <i>World of Wounds </i>with this idea in place.  I didn't have a clear map of <i>how  </i>I would achieve anything new or groundbreaking, much less, as I could see was so necessary, anything transformative or transcendent of today’s Core Stories and underlying Myths—but I wrote with this lodestar in my mind’s eye, with the urgency I could feel to my core about salvaging the beauty and privilege of life on this planet.  I created five unrelated characters, and followed them on journeys physical and interior which led each eventually to participate in a movement which echoes that practiced today by permaculturists, eco-villagers, homesteaders, founders of Transition Towns and many others who have made a priority of local self-sufficiency, eco-logical practice and priorities.  I finished and self-published the completed draft of the novel at the beginning of 2015, not seeing it as a perfect expression of the type of New Myths I could clearly see our culture needs, but confident inasmuch as the characters and stories unfolded authentically, and expressed what I was capable of communicating along the lines of the kind of New Story I had envisioned.  I enjoyed writing the interwoven stories, seeing how the characters and their journeys came together from very disparate starting-points to a common cause and forming the first seed, sprouting in the course of the stories’ unfolding, of a New (and Ancient) way of seeing and being on/with the earth.  It is certainly my hope that others find inspiration and enjoyment in the unfolding stories of the novel, in the characters’ growth and obstacles, mistakes and challenges, and where they arrive by the novel’s end.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">The year since publishing <i>World of Wounds</i> last winter has been an inspiring whirlwind.  My own international network of fellows informed and concerned about the above issues and much more grew rapidly, and I began to get to know a number of those I found myself most admiring.  By May, I was being interviewed by KMO for The C-Realm, probably my favorite podcast and the ""place"" I first heard and learned about Charles Eisenstein among many of my favorite writers and thinkers.  Soon after that interview, I attended a day-long New Story conference featuring Charles Eisenstein and another favorite writer and podcaster, Chris Martenson, and met both of them and many other amazing, committed individuals treading this urgent path.  I was honored when I contacted Adebayo, whose writings and speaking I had first run-across through its affinity with those of Charles Eisenstein, and Bayo had responded directly and very personally right from the outset.  I developed a similar correspondence and friendship-from-afar with Jason Hine, whose insightful Facebook posts regularly impressed and pierced me, shaking me into presence and open compassion in the midst of the urgency of these times.  My own intuition and disposition led me to embrace the notion that There Is No Enemy-- Jason's writing challenges me to consistently renew this realization, and examine my own intentions and flaws in the face of the temptation to blame, complain, ""force"" solutions or identify scapegoats.  Shahbano's poetry was introduced to me by a Rmala al'Aalam, fellow-member of the exceptional More Beautiful World Facebook group, an <span>international online community </span><span>whose title and premise are rooted in Eisenstein's most-recent book </span><i>The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know is Possible, </i><span>and a forum where Adebayo and Jason post regularly.  Rmala is a Pakistani woman who is designing the New Myths Press website and is a passionate contributor to forwarding the mission of NMP.  She knows Shahbano and her poetry, and recommended it to my attention.</span></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: justify;"">I don't believe that New Myths Press is alone or unique in identifying the degree to which the stories today's culture propagates and tells itself, stories of constant Progress and Endless Growth, are an important and inextricable root cause of the destruction being wreaked upon this planet's living systems and, potentially, it's ability to support life.  We certainly need more venues attempting to identity the new and ancient, existing stories which preserve and exalt life, see the sacred privilege of life as more essential than profit or domination, ""Progress"" and ever-growing ""resource"" extraction at the expense of ecosystems and the biosphere.</p>

New Myths Press

 
The World Needs New Core Stories.
New (ancient) ways of relating to nature, to each other, to notions of economics, of ""enough,"" to our human place within a larger planetary community
...for A Future.




The planet, life on this only planet we know of which supports life, is facing great challenges and stresses at the hands of humankind.  Humans in this global culture know many of the causes, but only speak of ""reducing"" fossil fuel emissions and other hyperabundant pollution which techno-industrial global society produces to maintain what are considered the minimum requirements of civilization.  Carbon dioxide, methane and other forms of pollution, meanwhile, increase each year despite promises and goals to ""reduce"" what must actually be discontinued for the planet to avoid extreme changes already occurring, already damaging life and its future prospects.  Today's humans are flattening global forests, overfishing the oceans, driving myriad species extinct, daily.
Humans once lived within the boundaries of the ecosystems that support life; those cultures which did not live within nature's boundaries (Easter Island, the Mayan civilization) disappeared.  Those cultures which lasted tens of thousands of years without overshooting the carrying capacity of the land they lived upon, and what the land provided them to continue living, had stories which taught each succeeding generation to fundamentally respect, hold and treat as sacred the land and life around them, grateful for the sacred privilege of life and understanding their own place as co-existent strands within the fabric of life.  These peoples did not see themselves as ""separate from,"" ""above"" nature and the life they saw about them.
We call the stories of these peoples ""myths,"" frequently with a condescending tone and underlying intent.  
Today's techno-industrial humanity, which William R. Catton, Jr. called ""Homo Colossus"" in his important book Overshoot, do not even see the myths currently driving them (us) to destroy that which makes life on this planet possible, as quickly as its ever-""improving"" machines can accomplish the task.
We need new stories.  We need New Myths, more like those of former (and still existing here and there upon the planet) humans.  We need those ancient stories, told in a way that today's humanity, those of us concerned for A Future, can reshape the destiny currently mapped-out and inexorable, unless we can imagine and pursue a new (ancient) path.  To even see that path, we need stories which point the way, and affect the actions we take, the beliefs we hold.
Humans love stories.  They are fundamental to who we are, how we see the world, ourselves, and our place within the world and life.  You might say, to use a techno-industrial metaphor, that they contain our operating system.
New Myths Press has its own origin story.  I know we live in a sound-byte, YouTube, Twitter-pated world in which few have the time to read more than 140 characters about something new, so I have included a Who? What? Where? When? Why? summary just below, and below that a breakdown of how New Myths Press will spend the funds contributed to this crowdfunding campaign.  The New Myths Press story is below these, and you are welcome to read it, or bookmark this page to read later when you have some time.

This IndieGogo campaign is designed to fund an exceptional launch to match the importance and vision of the writers about to publish with New Myths Press.  Along with their collections, a newly revised, edited version of the novel World of Wounds will also be published, all being launched soon after this campaign is complete.  We have made exciting Perks available to those who contribute— whatever you are able and inspired to contribute will greatly assist in providing these writers, and the Mission of New Myths Press as an endeavor, with the exposure they certainly deserve. Help by contributing to this campaign, and by spreading the word directly to those you know who would like and support New Myths Press.

New Myths Press is also seeking others, readers and writers, poets and novelists, essayists and speakers, all who are passionately committed to the search for and creation of New (and Ancient) Stories, new ways of seeing the world and our place in it, living with instead of at the expense of the planet’s living systems.
 In this campaign, your participation will help fund the rollout and marketing of three excellent writers in their first New Myths Press collaborations.  Adebayo Akomolafe is a Professor,  an international speaker, essayist and spiritual adventurer, questioning preconceptions and bending consciousness into a primal, direct-experiencing.  He offers counterintuitive wisdom such as:  “The times are urgent; let us  slow down.”  Jason Hine writes compassionate, powerful “alternative” sermons, frequently as short as a single paragraph, also several paragraphs and pages in length, all of which speak directly to the heart, releasing anxieties and evoking purpose, empathy, sacred attention and active participation in the birthing of a More Beautiful World.  Aliani Shahbano is a modern Sufi poet, distilling the passions of sacred Love and inspiring readers to attention and the presence of sacred beauty and Love in their own daily lives and smallest moments.  These are poems to read and re-read, to share and savor.  Aliani provides contextual introductions to each section of her collection, drawing a comparative  connection to the celebrated lineage her poetry belongs within: that of Rumi, and generations of sacred poets since.The campaign will also support the rollout and marketing of the newly revised and edited edition of Zack Lehtinen’s novel World of Wounds.  All who previously contributed to the crowdfunding campaign for that novel, or who have purchased World of Wounds in its existing form, will receive their chosen contribution “perks”  for this campaign,  and will also receive a signed copy of the newly-revised edition of the novel World of Wounds, regardless of the level of contribution.  You only have to ask.What?New Myths Press:  an independent, print-on-demand imprint collaborating to create attractive trade-paperback and Kindle eBooks.  New Myths publishes novels, collections of essays, poetry, speeches, stories and transcribed interviews/ conversations, and is open to publishing other types of writing as well.  All have in common the commitment to enVisioning ways of living in alignment with this one planet we share, seeking paradigms beyond what Charles Eisenstein has called the “space between stories” where many of us currently  reside:  the old, destructive, still-commonplace stories of infinite growth on a finite, deeply damaged planet, myths of techno-industrial utopian Progress, habits of seeing the earth and its beauties, its habitats and provisions as “resources” to exploit, even if that means polluting earth, air and oceans, razing ecosystems, driving species to extinction and compromising our own children’s ability to live on a survivable planet, much-less to thrive; and the necessary New (Ancient) Stories which embrace the beauty, resilience and sacred privilege of our place as humans, shared voices in the chorus of life, not disconnected, hubristic Masters and Conquerors of  the earth.  We have the ability, option, the sacred Privilege to live as a timeless dance with the beautiful world we have been born-into; but we require New (Ancient) Stories, new Myths, magical and sacred ways of seeing our relationship with our fellow-travelers, because the Core Stories currently being lived into existence have taken humanity and all life on this planet to a dangerous, existential brink. Stories have brought us here, and fuel the tremendous momentum of destruction which cannot be denied, and cannot be transcended from within the same stories.As Albert  Einstein famously  said, “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”  This simple truth is also profound, and points squarely to our culture’s core Myths.  Some might say, “Myths?  Those are ancient stories of magic, of pagan Gods, indigenous peoples and ignorant, pre-scientific times, fables and origin stories disconnected from what progress and scientific inquiry have allowed us to access in these post-Enlightenment times.”  Many cannot see, are too ensconced within the fluid of the stories they are swimming in to even acknowledge or understand that they ARE stories—they are today’s myths.  Myths of techno-industrial limitless growth and constant progress, myths of human control over the planet, a myth (to give just one specific example) which says that because our species “discovered” how to split atomic particles, that gives us the right to inflict the mass-destruction of nuclear chain reactions upon fellow human beings and other living things, to “harness” the energy of split atoms without any effective plan to protect the future from the radioactive “waste” such energy “production” manufactures…  And speaking of waste: current myths  tell us that it is a “normal” side-effect of being human to dump mountains of non-degradable plastics into the oceans, to heap carbon, methane and dioxin, synthetic “man-made” chemicals and genetically-modified life-forms  into the air and soil, water and biosphere, where their consequences are widespread, devastating and frequently last centuries in their destructive, disruptive potential.These are stories our culture tells itself, and these underlying stories support the continuing onslaught, fuel the attitudes and rationalizations which allow us to see wanton destruction of the capacity for life as the normal “business of life.” We need new stories—New (Ancient) Myths.New Myths Press is dedicated to finding, to collaborating with creators of  stories, those able to envision and describe paradigms of understanding and action required for A Future, and to sharing their writings  with you.Where?Distribution and participation are international.  New Myths Press titles are available anywhere Amazon operates (thus, can also be ordered by most physical bookstores upon request), anywhere Kindle books can be ordered and accessed.  Many New Myths Press writings will even be available free, online, but we are producing attractive trade-paperback volumes and Kindle eBooks, as affordable as we can make them, because we want you to be able to have these writings in your permanent library, available to read and re-read, share and gift.  New Myths contributors span the planet already—from the U.S. to Nigeria, from Pakistan to the U.K.—and we plan to expand this trend as we grow our community of Visionaries and eccentric communicators of unseen paradigms unfolding in our midst already, but invisible until enunciated.When?As we initiate this IndieGogo campaign, the writing described above is written, collected, being fine-tuned and edited, and should be ready for publication by the completion of the crowdfunding campaign in 40 days, or very soon thereafter.  Our goal is to publish by or before the second week in May, and by the end of this IndieGogo campaign we will likely have the publication date established and available.Why?For A Future.Breakdown of how funds will be spent:$1,000 to establish an SEO campaign using AdEdge online marketing, Westport, CT, including ad designs and upgrade to website and social media presence/ appearance/ effectiveness.I have done my research, and AdEdge is the best at what it does: they are expert at leveraging the advanced tools of SEO (search engine optimization online), targeting online marketing, in compelling but non-invasive ways, using the latest and best tools of GoogleAds, Facebook and social media generally, making sure the ads we use, our website and social media pages are designed and placed to attract those seeking exactly this sort of ""product.""  The expansion of New Myths Press will be in the best of hands; your contribution will make the greatest difference possible in spreading this endeavor, these great writers and their urgent words, without access to a large publisher's budget and marketing department.  $500 for a targeted online marketing campaign using AdEdge online marketing.$500 for a targeted, specialized social media campaign using AdEdge online marketing.$300/ month, first 12 months of ongoing online marketing costs:  $3,600$50 for review/ promotion services from Serious Reading:  serious reading.com$250 for business expenses, startup$500 for readings/appearances by New Myths Press writers This totals $6,400, an amount which will establish New Myths Press with all initial advertising and marketing costs for an independent launch campaign, lasting nearly a year in which the Press can establish itself, advertise its authors, expand awareness of this essential offering.  If we do not reach this goal, we will use the funds in as effective and targeted a way possible to maximize and expand existing social media and online presence, upgrading and launching the New Myths Press website and whatever GoogleAds funding achieved will allow us to make and place.  If we exceed this funding goal, all funds will go into further marketing and expansion efforts of New Myths Press, to promote the writers current and future who contribute to its crucial mission of providing urgently needed New (Ancient) Myths-- for A Future. Your ContributionNew Myths Press has reached a key state of potential to grow-into, to identify  and communicate with  its ideal audience.  We will continue finding and publishing  essential writings,  introducing more international contributors into the New Myths Press canon.  Adebayo, Jason and Aliani are exciting, richly expressive, rewarding writers who have demonstrated ongoing commitment to playing their parts in ushering-in the More Beautiful World our hearts imagine and hope to co-create. Your contribution, even of the smallest pledge-amount, will play a key, very direct role in allowing New Myths Press to expand the readership these writers deserve, as well as providing an empowering platform for bringing new writers to the attention of those seeking this sort of writing:  urgent, beautiful voices writing their hearts’ vision for A Future. New Myths Press will continue gathering an impressive cadre of further writers, poets, storytellers and philosophers, those whose words open New (Ancient) vistas of planetary healing and, just possibly, a thriving future rather than the one currently being approached headlong at maximum velocity.Supporting New Myths Press is an investment in a better Future for our kids and future generations.  They will need new stories to get through difficult times already encroaching—New Myths to frame the struggle of constructing a More Beautiful World.THANK YOU for your contribution!  These writers have created beautiful, urgent, vital writing—they deserve a large, appreciative audience.  This campaign represents a commitment to expand that audience with all the targeted, customized power that a well-designed, professional online advertising and social media campaign can provide.  If we make less than our target amount, we will economize the effort with the same intention and pursuit; the compelling opportunity of reaching or exceeding our fundraising goal is that these writers, and the expansion of New Myths Press, will have the opportunity to expand just at the moment that these exciting, important international voices are published.Support these writers.  Support the search for the New (Ancient) Stories our damaged world needs, which our children and future generations can benefit from our having brought-into the world..  Stories, poems, speeches, essays, sacred insights from everyday people who have tapped-into their concerns, their gift for words, their deepest, most honest and authentic expression of what will be required of our human generation.New Myths:  for A Future.A few related links, resonant and inspiring to the New Myths Press vision and mission:Manish Jain:  http://schoolingtheworld.org/people/manish/Charles Eisenstein:   http://charleseisenstein.netA characteristically powerful, insightful video of Charles speaking-- highly resonant with New Myths Press's vision and mission:  http://charleseisenstein.net/project/story-disruption-morphogenesis-2015/William Catton Jr., Overshoot:  William R. Catton, Jr.-- ""Sociology's Neglect of Ecological Context"" The origin story of New Myths Press, thus-far and growing:A Question was More than merely Gnawing at Me:How do We Unravel the Mounting, Global Crises that So Few Even Want to Acknowledge?I grew up with an awareness that pollution, deforestation, excessive human population and consumption, and a preponderance of violence and warfare (and the capacities of nuclear and other mass- destructive “options”  at the push of a button)  were looming problems which seemed to grow ever-larger on the planet in my lifetime.  Even as progress was made to “fix” an aspect of one of the diverse  problems (the lowering of pollution-levels and cleaning of rivers in formerly-industrial cities of America, for example), a global view made it clear to the informed that these “costs of progress” (largely unpaid by the “producers” of pollution) were merely shifted, as large-scale industrial production went from the U.S. to (mostly) Asia, where pollution is now more extreme than it was in earlier industrial America.  And of course, pollution knows no boundaries, does not “stay put” where it is produced.  Just because it is “out of sight,” does not mean it is not increasing vastly, spreading its effects throughout this cornerless orb.Thirteen years ago, my daughter was born, and my existing concerns about these ever-growing problems intensified at the prospect of passing along to my daughter, her generation, and future generations a deeply damaged planet.  My feelings and concerns were no longer general, a matter of self-education accompanied by a shrug of the shoulders and “well, what can be done?”  It was not merely my own discomfort and melancholy at the prospect of a deteriorating world, the extinction of species, the razing of dense forests which are not only habitats (that is, the only available homes)  of myriad species, but also serve as the literal “lungs” of the planet itself, creating  the oxygen which all breathing species require to survive on this Sacred Gift, the Only Survivable Planet available to us—suddenly, I  had a beloved child to bring up in this damaged world!  Why weren't fellow-parents everywhere screaming from the rooftops with rage and despair, actively and rapidly dismantling the mechanisms and incentives making planetary rape profitable, thus apparently inevitable?  When I shared information about these mounting environmental and other crises, enunciated by experts on the scale and nature of the problems, as well as those suggesting and pursuing possible solutions, small/ local and large-scale—why were these expressions so often met with a deafening, soul-shattering silence? 
Were others not concerned?  
Aside from the havoc of pollution, climate chaos, and the “nuclear genie,” I learned in the decade since my daughter’s birth about peak oil, predicted by then-prominent oil geologist Marion Hubbert in the 1950s, and peak Everything (metals, minerals, “resources” of every stripe), accurately forecast in the early 1970s by the original Club of Rome Limits to Growth report.  These predicted peaks are all manifesting, as mainstream and full-on denialist media, politicians and (especially) economists condescendingly deny and ignore their clear signs and cratering effects on the global economy.  As they rapidly approach the point of irreversible undeniability, financial collapse looks likely to be the first “shot across the bow” which shocks many clinging to still-ubiquitous delusions of techno-utopia and limitless growth into an unwilling, likely devastating and worldview-shattering, “unexpected” paradigm of unremitting—well, Less.
However, and however rapidly, the impending shifts tumble forth upon us, it will be uncomfortable and paradigm-crushing for many.  Most still believe, no matter what their awareness or degree of concern, that “They'll think of something,” that the middle class lifestyle that many (though a significant minority, globally) have grown accustomed to will inexorably, inevitably continue, that these problems will, of course, be solved, and “those (evil) people” must and will  be overcome, but that “our standard of living” can and certainly will be protected and sustained, is sacrosanct and inevitable…
The phrases and terms above in quotes, and the many similar words and phrases commonplace today, are mirrored shards of this world’s myths, and even those of us not deep in belligerent, bellicose denial about the existence (much less depth) of the myriad problems and challenges facing us and the planet our species is squeezing tend to live as though the central Myth, as battered and compromised as it is and seems at times, is ultimately true:  the Myth of Progress.  “Whatever stumbles occur  and obstacles obstruct, however much the trajectory seems one step forward and two steps back, We are on a Path Toward Progress, ever upward, to the stars and beyond,” says this core myth.  “If fossil fuels become scarce [too expensive to remain ubiquitous], and pollute too much, we will switch to solar and wind to power our homes and trips to the strip malls and our commute to our cubicles”…  But fossil fuels are a very, uniquely concentrated form of energy, and are used for far more than just electrifying homes and getting to work. 
Pollution and climate change are looming, major threats, and humans have already proven committed (by actions, and lack thereof) to the Too Little, Too Late path as far as any serious address of these and so many related issues and problems—eradication of forests and species, fisheries and ocean life, rampant desertification, drought and accompanying crop failures and famine—problems related to each other inasmuch as they all tie-in to the core stories and worldview which allow us to see humans, civilized techno-industrial humans in particular, as separate and above the earth’s life forms and that which we define as “resources.”  The techno-industrial  worldview, stories, underlying agreements, many unspoken, about what is important, what goals to pursue, about participants’ purpose in life and the meaning gleaned from existence, these have a primary significance and impact upon our actions and attitudes as a species, as global techno-industrial civilization.
It was in coming to this conclusion that I had my own personal “a-ha!” moment.  Not that I saw myself as so important and wise as to be able to single-handedly make any significant shift in the momentum of destruction of “our” culture, but the epiphany allowed me to shift from despondency and a sense of futility, a sense that many commonplace forms of protest and activism have been ineffective and somehow “not it,” to a sense of identifying a powerful force within the core of us all, a seemingly unrelated but highly significant aspect of what allows and causes humanity to be so destructive, and heedless of the wastelands in our wake:  our Core Stories move us to do these things, and both motivate and justify our destructive activities, from war and colonial/cultural genocide to the outright destruction of vast swaths of the landscape which destroy habitats and drive countless species extinct. 
The Myths of Progress and Endless Growth are pervasive yet subtle.  They are a modern extension of the idea of Manifest Destiny, but we can look back with historic detachment upon those two words and their underlying beliefs with some distance and disapproval, whereas most today have no such perspective on the rigidity and staunch Faith wrapped up in the ideas of constant, ever-increasing Progress and economic Growth which most embrace today as unquestionable Truth.  Most today would not describe or accept a definition of these terms as “beliefs,” and don't accept that there is any way around the harm being done to the planet, if an alternative meant an end to, much-less a reversal of, economic growth or constant technological Progress.  Just as slavery seemed inevitable, normal and was justified in its time and context, continuing extraction of millions of barrels of substances which contribute to making the planet unfit for living things currently alive on the planet, possibly including our own species, is not seen as negotiable.  Even those who “oppose fossil fuels,” many of us, most of us, still drive cars, fly in planes, use roads and plastics and heat our homes using the energy of burned carbon.  We still use and require money, work in jobs to earn that money, and use the resources our culture and its stories make available to us, day-to-day, minute by minute.
It really hit me how influential these underlying stories are, how entwined they are with the actions, beliefs and routines of our lives.  We live IN our stories; our stories PREVENT us from taking different courses of action, however much we might oppose the harm done by those very actions.  Another aspect of story-centrality to how we relate to (or fail to) the consequences of living-out these stories is that, for those of us opposed to the idea of imposing these consequences on our children and those yet-unborn (much-less ourselves, already, Now), a consistent way to see the problems and their consequences is in terms of an Evil Enemy who is responsible and must be opposed, must be stopped.  We must Fight, we must Battle, we must Oppose the forces of Evil!  Whether we see corporate CEOs as evil, or politicians (or politicians of the Other party), or oil companies, or chemical or agribusiness or banking and finance companies; whether Wall Street or Hollywood or the Military Industrial Complex or Organized Religion—when we portray any or all of these Others as those Responsible, as those inhuman, callous and self-interested enough to have Caused the problems we wish didn't exist, we create the aggressive, dualistic, oppositional energy which tends merely to exacerbate existing problems, and which fails to take into account the mirror.  Enemies are central players in all conventional stories; battling and overcoming enemies is the way we see “our” stories—it is, though, an important reason we new new types of stories, in which endless conflict and blame and scapegoating are not the pervasive features, ineffective in laying-out new paradigms which will be necessary to have a chance of moving beyond current culture’s destructiveness.
A lifelong creative, with hands-on experience and university/ professional-level training in numerous forms of art and performance, my most consistent, lifelong creative outlet and through-line has been my love of writing.  My university BA is in English; I have written poetry since high school, consistently; I have written a one-act play which has been performed in America and at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland; I have written multiple feature-length screenplays, one of which was independently produced; I have written and self-published a book on alternative education. 
I have also written stories, and written a few individual episodes of memoir—but over the years, I had only glanced (""too busy!""—aren't we all?) at the notion of writing a novel. 
I didn't kid myself that writing one novel was going to “save the world”—but my epiphanies about the centrality and pervasiveness of our culture’s stories to how we see, and crucially, to how we act in and upon the world, made me realize that I wanted to intentionally write with New Stories, New Myths in mind.  I began writing the novel World of Wounds with this idea in place.  I didn't have a clear map of how  I would achieve anything new or groundbreaking, much less, as I could see was so necessary, anything transformative or transcendent of today’s Core Stories and underlying Myths—but I wrote with this lodestar in my mind’s eye, with the urgency I could feel to my core about salvaging the beauty and privilege of life on this planet.  I created five unrelated characters, and followed them on journeys physical and interior which led each eventually to participate in a movement which echoes that practiced today by permaculturists, eco-villagers, homesteaders, founders of Transition Towns and many others who have made a priority of local self-sufficiency, eco-logical practice and priorities.  I finished and self-published the completed draft of the novel at the beginning of 2015, not seeing it as a perfect expression of the type of New Myths I could clearly see our culture needs, but confident inasmuch as the characters and stories unfolded authentically, and expressed what I was capable of communicating along the lines of the kind of New Story I had envisioned.  I enjoyed writing the interwoven stories, seeing how the characters and their journeys came together from very disparate starting-points to a common cause and forming the first seed, sprouting in the course of the stories’ unfolding, of a New (and Ancient) way of seeing and being on/with the earth.  It is certainly my hope that others find inspiration and enjoyment in the unfolding stories of the novel, in the characters’ growth and obstacles, mistakes and challenges, and where they arrive by the novel’s end.
The year since publishing World of Wounds last winter has been an inspiring whirlwind.  My own international network of fellows informed and concerned about the above issues and much more grew rapidly, and I began to get to know a number of those I found myself most admiring.  By May, I was being interviewed by KMO for The C-Realm, probably my favorite podcast and the ""place"" I first heard and learned about Charles Eisenstein among many of my favorite writers and thinkers.  Soon after that interview, I attended a day-long New Story conference featuring Charles Eisenstein and another favorite writer and podcaster, Chris Martenson, and met both of them and many other amazing, committed individuals treading this urgent path.  I was honored when I contacted Adebayo, whose writings and speaking I had first run-across through its affinity with those of Charles Eisenstein, and Bayo had responded directly and very personally right from the outset.  I developed a similar correspondence and friendship-from-afar with Jason Hine, whose insightful Facebook posts regularly impressed and pierced me, shaking me into presence and open compassion in the midst of the urgency of these times.  My own intuition and disposition led me to embrace the notion that There Is No Enemy-- Jason's writing challenges me to consistently renew this realization, and examine my own intentions and flaws in the face of the temptation to blame, complain, ""force"" solutions or identify scapegoats.  Shahbano's poetry was introduced to me by a Rmala al'Aalam, fellow-member of the exceptional More Beautiful World Facebook group, an international online community whose title and premise are rooted in Eisenstein's most-recent book The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know is Possible, and a forum where Adebayo and Jason post regularly.  Rmala is a Pakistani woman who is designing the New Myths Press website and is a passionate contributor to forwarding the mission of NMP.  She knows Shahbano and her poetry, and recommended it to my attention.
I don't believe that New Myths Press is alone or unique in identifying the degree to which the stories today's culture propagates and tells itself, stories of constant Progress and Endless Growth, are an important and inextricable root cause of the destruction being wreaked upon this planet's living systems and, potentially, it's ability to support life.  We certainly need more venues attempting to identity the new and ancient, existing stories which preserve and exalt life, see the sacred privilege of life as more essential than profit or domination, ""Progress"" and ever-growing ""resource"" extraction at the expense of ecosystems and the biosphere.

<p>I am Tomás Loyola Barberis. Among other things that define me 
professionally, I’m a journalist and a writer. I am also gay. Being gay 
is an irreplaceable part of my life, of who I am. However, for a long 
time I wished to run away from myself and from my feelings. I locked 
myself in a dark place, where I remained until my thirties.</p>
<p>Yes, I
 came out of the closet as an adult man at age 33. I did this through a 
letter I sent to my parents explaining everything I felt. You can read 
it here: <a href=""http://www.comingoutcampaign.com/blog/open-letter-from-a-gay-to-his-parents"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.comingoutcampaign.com/blog/open-letter-from-a-gay-to-his-parents</a>.</p>
<p>I
 had started this letter approximately 3 years before deciding to send 
it. For a long time, I continued to correct it, edit it and save it 
among my drafts, trying to find the courage to click Send. I pictured 
myself a thousand times in every possible scenario I could think of, 
thinking: “What if...”. None was ever as great, warm or welcoming as 
what I experienced with my family.</p>
<p>Through the letter, I was able 
to come to terms with myself and my family, my world and my feelings. 
Today, 6 years on, I can confirm this was the best decision I ever made 
in my life. On top of this, in this time I married a wonderful man and 
today I can stand proud and say that I’m gay out loud, without fear. This is a picture of our wedding!<br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why am I launching this campaign?</b></p>
<p>Given
 the current situation of both the countries that I follow the most on 
the news (one being my country of origin: Chile; the other, the one I 
live in: Spain), I realize that there is still much work to be done 
regarding the rights of the LGBT community: equal marriage, civil 
partnership, inheritance and other rights.</p>
<p>More importantly, there
 is still much work left to be done in society to eradicate LGBTphobia 
and any manifestation against a person’s sexual identity, regardless of 
where they live. I guess this holds true for most parts of Latin America
 and Spain, in spite of the progress made until now.</p>
<p>According
to the study “I won’t play this game” carried out by NGO Save the Children,
presented in Spain in February 2016 and which collects bullying figures
according to students across the Spanish territory, students who bully others
justify their actions using, among others, the following reasons: 9.3% do so
due to their victim’s race, culture or religion, while 8.6% do so based on their
victim’s sexual identity and related issues.</p>
<p>21 men was 
been harassed and beated in the last 6 weeks just because they're gay...
 only in Madrid! And a few years ago, a young man was tortured and 
killed in Chile just because he loved men. We need to stop this!<br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>What are my goals?</b></p>
<p>There are mainly three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing a book that presents other experiences like mine. My aim 
is for these stories to become social references for present and future 
generations, facilitating with this the process of coming out and 
acceptance of oneself and from the people around us. </li>
<li>Creating a website which also reflects these stories. The site will 
be used as a space for information and exchange between girls, boys, 
teenagers and young adults as well as mothers, fathers and tutors. </li>
<li>Opening an interactive exchange space where LGBT issues can be 
addressed from different perspectives, with an educational and 
awareness-raising purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Therefore, the money collected will be used to:</p>
<p>A. Research and gather stories of men and
women, their experiences, their fears and their certainties, once their coming
out process has taken place. Through this, the idea is to recognize common
experiences and, also, to inspire readers in their own processes. <b>(0 euros)</b><br/></p>
<p>B. Edit, design and publish a book with these
stories, in print and as an eBook. The aim is to reach as many people as
possible and to present valuable material that will help us develop a more open
and fairer society. <b>(3.000 euros)</b><br/></p>
<p>C. Create a website with all the material
gathered and also to open interactive channels with the audience addressed:
girls, boys, teenagers and young adults as well as mothers, fathers and tutors. <b>(2.000 euros)</b><br/></p>
<p>D. Carry out continuous actions in the field of
education, from Primary Schools to Universities, in order to: <b>(1.500 euros)</b><br/></p>
<ul>
<p>- Equip students with the tools
necessary to avoid and fight harassment of any type, especially in regard to
sexual identity.</p>
<p>- Equip teachers with an
understanding of bullying and cyberbullying and techniques to detect, identify,
mediate and intervene in such situations.</p>
<p>- Equip parents and guardians with
guides to be used in the family sphere, making it possible to detect cases of
harassment and eradicating them through educational activities that can be
carried out at school and at home.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</ul>
<p>E. Work closely with other persons, organizations,
foundations, associations, NGOs and local institutions whose projects or
programs are related to the work we wish to carry out with the Coming Out
Campaign. <b>(0 euros)</b><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The earlier we can gather the money projected for this campaign,
 the sooner I can get started with the project. Your contribution is 
very important to help avoid further victims of harassment based on 
sexual identity, whatever form the harassment takes. It will also help 
to avoid traumatic experiences for the new generations in their coming 
out process. This is especially important at a time when LGBT freedom 
and rights are suffering setbacks.</p>
<p>This project means a lot to me.
 I believe that it is indispensable for us to open spaces for dialogue 
where experiences can be exchanged and to create visible role models for
 girls, boys, teenagers and young adults towards the future. However, we
 also need to raise awareness in society about the harassment and fear 
and what it means for so many men and women to live inside the closet. 
There is no better way to do this than by sharing the experiences of 
those of us who have already gone through this process.</p>
<p>Your 
support is absolutely necessary to kick-start and carry out this 
project. That is why any help will be rewarded, not only with our 
personal gratitude on a special page in the book but by making it 
possible for you to participate actively in the creation process and in 
disseminating and raising awareness about this work.</p>

<p><b><u>Why This Story</u></b></p>
<p>There are a lot of great stories for children to read out
there in the market. However, I’m noticing a frightening trend that audiences
are gravitating towards stories that lack in morals, character, values, and
overall appropriateness. Where are the good stories that are wholesome and fun,
without the use of sex, profanity, and extreme violence? Being a new father, I
want my family to know that they can find good clean entertainment in books. I
hope to make a significant contribution to this by publishing my books.<i>Checkmate</i> will
be the first of many books that I intend to write that will be simple, fun, and
family appropriate. </p><p><b><u>Wanna Check It Out?</u></b></p><p>If you want to see exactly what your getting, click <a href=""http://mnwoolley.weebly.com/uploads/1/8/8/3/18838102/preview_chapters.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a> for a free download of the first five chapters!!!! ;)</p><p>Also, to give you some assurance, check out these screenshots of actual reviews of readers who have read the whole story. ;)</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466048908/2016-06-15_nbkleq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466048951/2016-06-15_1_ms9uyh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466049024/2016-06-15_3_gskol5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

Why This Story
There are a lot of great stories for children to read out
there in the market. However, I’m noticing a frightening trend that audiences
are gravitating towards stories that lack in morals, character, values, and
overall appropriateness. Where are the good stories that are wholesome and fun,
without the use of sex, profanity, and extreme violence? Being a new father, I
want my family to know that they can find good clean entertainment in books. I
hope to make a significant contribution to this by publishing my books.Checkmate will
be the first of many books that I intend to write that will be simple, fun, and
family appropriate. Wanna Check It Out?If you want to see exactly what your getting, click HERE for a free download of the first five chapters!!!! ;)Also, to give you some assurance, check out these screenshots of actual reviews of readers who have read the whole story. ;)
Our Thanks
In actuality, any and all help given will be greatly
appreciated, and I would be eternally grateful for all of it. So, to those who
have contributed, who will contribute, and who will help in many other ways,
from me and my family, I’d like to say thank you, so very much.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Harun Rabbani and I am a mentor, a transformational leader and an award-winning trainer and professional speaker. I've been immersed in social and professional relationship-building since I was 12 working for my dad. Since then, I've worked in the corporate arena, and have been running my business since 2003. I've also been an active campaigner for several humanitarian projects and charities. </p>
<p>In 1998, I started my personal development journey and years later interviewed hundreds of some of the world's leading experts in the human potential movement. This has led me to conclude that, ultimately, our greatest success, happiness and fulfilment come from meaningful relationships. </p>
<p>Therefore, I began writing a book on this topic called <strong>""The Influencer's Handbook""</strong>. It is about how to build <i>inspired, influential and impactful relationships</i> with the people who matter most to you. I call those people your ""tribe"". </p>
<p>As well as exploring the psychology of influential relationships, ""The Influencer's Handbook"" takes a deep dive into the energetic dynamics into meaningful relationships. What causes relationship breakdown and what brings people together into trusting relationships?</p>
<p>Your contribution will ensure the success publication, launch and promotion of ""The Influencer's Handbook"" both in the UK and internationally.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our first goal is to raise £5,354 will pay for the book to be published by professionals. This money will pay for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Professionally publishing the book (includes proof-reading, editing, book cover design etc).</li>
<li>Circulating the book to a massive network of distributors globally.</li>
<li>Making the book available on all major online retail units. </li>
<li>Publicity through social media campaigns. </li>
<li>A highly publicised book launch in London. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a contributor, you hare helping impact on thousands of lives. Here are some of the reasons why the content of ""The Influencer's Handbook"" is so vital to helping people:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will help organisational leaders (CEO's, directors, etc) significantly increase their employee and customer engagement</li>
<li>New emerging leaders will accelerate their capability to inspire, influence and impact the people, the planet and themselves. </li>
<li>Readers will be able to increase the richness of their relationships with families and friends. </li>
<li>Give courage and confidence to people who are feeling isolated and alone. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is my fourth publication in which I am using my real life experience of transforming thousands of lives to reach out to a much wider audience. I am a firm believer that books can inspire people to change lives. This book will also give tools for people to impact on other lives.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The greatest risk is not being able to write the book. The good news is that I have nearly completed writing the first draft. There is also the issue of finding a reputable publisher.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is the story of a woman who spent her life fighting an uphill battle against a man's world that wanted to own her. It's the story of the origins of feminism, journalism, and the prison system in the U.S. It's as relevant as ever today, and needs to be told. </p>
<p>I'm turning Ann's story into a film, so of course, before doing that, I need to write a script. Since this is a true story, and has been obscured by history, I've been doing meticulous research to get it right. I've reached the point where continuing my research means visiting archives and libraries, and to do so I will need funding. </p>
<p>By supporting my research you will help me make this immensely important research trip happen, and enable me to focus on writing so I can submit this project for filmmaking fellowships and grants. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise $5K in total. $3K will cover the cost of a research trip, which is budgeted for flights, car rentals, food, AirBnBs (when I can't stay with friends), phone coverage overseas, and travel insurance. I plan to visit Washington DC, Philadelphia, Syracuse, and New York City. $2K will cover cost of living expenses for 2-3 months so I can focus on writing. I've spent the last year working on this project every second I've had, but at this point I need to spend some time without a day job taking away time and energy, so that I can prioritize this project. Essentially I'm asking supporters to contribute to a self-made writing grant. </p>
<p>To show my gratitude for your support, I want to offer the following rewards: </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$5  ---- An individual thank you email!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$10 ---- The above, plus a social media shoutout during my research trip!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$15 ---- The above, plus a postcard from my research trip!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$30 ---- The above, plus a souvenir from my research trip, mailed to you!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$50 ---- The above, plus an original print of one of my photos (you can choose from <a href=""https://www.juliagazdag.com/photo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my website</a>)!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$100 --- The above, plus a poem written uniquely for you, by me, in the style of early 19th century American poetry! </p>
<p>Even if I don't reach my goal, any funds raised will go towards the research trip. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've never been as passionate about a project as I am about this script. This story is so relevant today, and even though I see it as a hilarious period-piece comedy, it's also a startlingly relevant commentary on our own era. Sometimes the best way to look at ourselves is to do it through the lens of someone else's life. The internet has been massively helpful in letting me access documents, books, and people who have helped this project take shape. What I need your help with now is to dive into archives to connect the final dots and overturn the final stones. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ann's story hasn't been preserved very well. She left a short autobiography and  a couple of trial transcripts, and that's about it. Although I hope to track down information on friends and lovers she had, as well as a portrait of her that has gotten lost over the years, historical research like this is always a gamble. I may spend weeks traveling the East Coast and looking through centuries old volumes only to barely find anything. I'm prepared for this, and also feel that in order to do this script justice, I need to have a clear idea of the limitations of character insights I have to work with. If nothing else, I will have the chance to spend time with a historian I've been in touch with, who has researched Ann, her life, and her time period extensively. I have archival experience and know exactly what I'm looking for, I just need to get to where it's being preserved, as most of the information I need is in old and fragile books and ledgers. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
This is the story of a woman who spent her life fighting an uphill battle against a man's world that wanted to own her. It's the story of the origins of feminism, journalism, and the prison system in the U.S. It's as relevant as ever today, and needs to be told. 
I'm turning Ann's story into a film, so of course, before doing that, I need to write a script. Since this is a true story, and has been obscured by history, I've been doing meticulous research to get it right. I've reached the point where continuing my research means visiting archives and libraries, and to do so I will need funding. 
By supporting my research you will help me make this immensely important research trip happen, and enable me to focus on writing so I can submit this project for filmmaking fellowships and grants. 

What I Need & What You Get
I'm looking to raise $5K in total. $3K will cover the cost of a research trip, which is budgeted for flights, car rentals, food, AirBnBs (when I can't stay with friends), phone coverage overseas, and travel insurance.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><u>Otkrivanje korespondencije i početak projekta</u></i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>""Iako mnogo sigurno znate o situaciji  ovdje - stvarnost se ne može vidjeti na TV-u ni ispričati. To treba proživjeti i preživjeti. Nisam baš paničar - ali stvarno je grozno. Sad znam šta znači golo preživljavanje za opstanak..."" (22/09/1992)</strong></i></p>
<p>          Prije točno godinu dana, u moje ruke dospio je fascikl pun poštanskih kuverata na kojemu je pisalo ""Pisma Sarajevo."" U svakoj od kuverata nalazilo se pismo, s nekoliko dodatnih pisama bez svoje odgovarajuće ""kućice"". Nije trebalo dugo kako bih shvatio da u rukama držim ratnu korespondenciju (Raspad SFRJ - Rat u BiH) između moje bake koja je živjela u Zagrebu te njene sestre, koja je kao Hrvatica odselila u Sarajevo zbog ljubavi, davnih 1960-ih godina. Potonju sestru i njenog supruga, kao i sve ostale građane Sarajeva, rat je zatekao potpuno nespremne. U njihovom slučaju još i na prvoj crti bojišnice (granica između četvrti Hrasno i Grbavica - što je ujedno bila i granica između dviju zaraćenih strana.) Bio je to travanj 1992. godine. Nisu niti slutili što ih čeka u, pokazat će se, jednoj od najduljih opsada u povijesti modernog ratovanja - trajala je punih 44 mjeseci. Gotovo trenutačno, započeo sam proces transkribiranja navedenih pisama, ne shvaćajući u potpunosti ni sam kakav materijal držim u rukama.</p>
<p><strong><i>""Moj muž je iscjepao jednu stalažu pa tako na drvcima na balkonu u posudi kuham, a granate fijuću okolo. Sve radim u čučećem položaju. Kako peremo sebe i veš - ne pitajte. Još nisam popila nijednu tabletu za smirenje, niti tablete za pritisak. Što je veće pucanje - kod mene manji pritisak!"" </i></strong><i><strong>(22/09/1992)</strong></i></p>
<p>          Nakon uspješnog transkribiranja (prepisivanja) pisama u pregledni, digitalni format, rezultati su bili sljedeći: punih 130 stranica zapanjujućeg teksta po standardnom formatu (TNR; 12; 1,5). Odmah mi je bilo jasno kako stvar ne smije ostati samo na tome. Oprezno u početku, najbližoj rodbini i prijateljima spomenuo sam svoje namjere. Ohrabren njihovim reakcijama (hvala svima na tome!), odlučio sam dalje kontaktirati i nekoliko institucija, za koje sam smatrao kako bi mogli biti zainteresirani za suradnju na ovom projektu. Moram ponosno reći kako sam i u tom pogledu sa svih strana dobio pozitivne reakcije, a posebnu zahvalu želim iskazati <strong>Historijskom muzeju BiH<i>, </i></strong>koji je ponudio svoju punu podršku i suradnju na ovom projektu <strong>( <a href=""http://muzej.ba/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://muzej.ba/ )</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>""...jučer je taj mrtav čovjek ležao 2 sata nasred dvorišta. Prvih deset minuta gledali smo kroz prozor, a onda smo nastavili pričati i piti kavu. Tek nakon dva sata je došao oklopni transporter. Bacili su dimnu zavjesu i izvukli i one mrtve i ranjene koji su sami sebi podvezali noge remenjem od hlača i čekali spas. Krvi je bilo malo jer ga je pogodio ravno u srce. Očito neki kvalitetni snajperista. Sad manje bacaju granate, ali su se dali na precizno ubijanje stanovništva."" (27/05/1993)</strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><u><strong>O meni</strong></u></i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>          Po struci magistar povijesti (trenutno na poslijediplomskom studiju moderne i suvremene povijesti na Filozofskom fakultetu u Zagrebu), magistrirao sam ni više ni manje nego baš na - korespondenciji ( <a href=""https://zir.nsk.hr/islandora/object/hrstud%3A1150"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://zir.nsk.hr/islandora/object/hrstud%3A1150 .) </a>Upravo mi ta slučajnost daje dodatno samopouzdanje, a donekle i onaj pozitivni osjećaj kako je ""suđeno"" da se ovaj projekt u potpunosti ostvari.</p>
<p>          Osim navedenog magistarskog rada, iza sebe imam još nekoliko objavljenih radova ( Npr: <a href=""https://www.hrstud.unizg.hr/_download/repository/Lucius_sv._22_%282017%29.pdf.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.hrstud.unizg.hr/_download/repository/Lucius_sv._22_%282017%29.pdf.pdf ) </a>Navedeni radovi primarno su imali znanstveno-istraživački pristup, dok će ovaj projekt biti u svojoj osnovi ipak nešto drugačiji te znatno bliži popularnoj literaturi.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><u>Kako i zašto podržati ovaj projekt?</u></i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>          Na žalost, situacija u današnjem nakladništvu, kao i bilo kakva formalna potpora projektima (knjigama) u nastajanju prilično je loša. Iako ne nepostojeća, financijska sredstva koja se mogu očekivati na taj način nisu ni blizu dostatna za dovršiti projekt, a posebno projekt ove vrste. Iz tog razloga odlučio sam se za pomoć obratiti svima Vama. Sredstva koja se prikupe biti će korištena da se pokriju sljedeći troškovi:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trošak putovanja i smještaja na relaciji Zagreb - Sarajevo; Zagreb - Split; Zagreb-Rijeka; Zagreb - Beograd. Na sve navedene lokacije zbog opsega posla i istraživanja biti će potrebno ići u više navrata (intervjuiranje osoba koje se spominju u pismima, prikupljanje foto materijala iz ratnog perioda, fotografiranje bitnih lokacija i njihovog današnjeg izgleda, posjeta raznim institucijama itd...)</li>
<li>Honorar za fotografa, ilustratora, lektora i ostale suradnike koji će imati puno posla</li>
<li>Troškovi javnog bilježnika i pravnika (autorska prava i osiguravanje teksta)</li>
<li>Potencijalno samostalno izdavanje knjige, a svakako u najmanju ruku izrada i printanje nekoliko oglednih primjeraka</li>
<li>Svi ostali dodatni, skriveni troškovi koji se, na žalost - uvijek pojave</li>
</ul>
<p>          Trudio sam se da ukupan iznos koji se potražuje u kampanji zaista bude što je moguće realniji. Nije mi namjera zaraditi na Vama koji iskreno želite podržati ovaj projekt, ali niti skromno odabrati iznos koji neće biti dostatan da se projekt napravi do kraja i kako treba. S obzirom da ovaj projekt radim i s velikom dozom emocija (jer se radi o obiteljskoj ostavštini), trudit ću se da kvaliteta zaista bude na razini. Uz navedena sredstva, ako ih zajedničkim snagama uspijemo prikupiti - vjerujem kako je upravo to i moguće!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>          Ovaj naslov nije slučajno u množini. Bez Vas ovaj projekt ne bi bilo moguće kvalitetno napraviti, a možda čak niti napraviti uopće. Vašim sudjelovanjem omogućit ćete da na svijet dođe knjiga koja na prvo mjesto stavlja običnog čovjeka i običnu obitelj koja se našla u vrtlogu prljavog rata. Knjiga koja opisuje svakodnevnicu preživljavanja u opkoljenom gradu u kojem mjesecima nema osnovnih sredstava za život: vode, hrane, struje, plina, drva, novca...Knjiga koja donosi i opisuje sve poteškoće oko naizgled banalnih stvari - pranja veša, tuširanja, grijanja, kuhanja...Knjiga koja donosi cijene namirnica u ratnom razdoblju, ""ratne recepte"" za jela, metode preživljavanja prilikom pokušaja odlaska na poštu ili na tržnicu. Ukratko, ovo će biti knjiga koja neće pisati o politici, političarima i ratnoj kronologiji, već o posljedicama te politike koje osjećaju ""obični građani.""</p>
<p>          Takvih knjiga na tržištu općenito je vrlo malo, a pogotovo ako uzmemo u obzir isključivo primjer opsade Sarajeva. S punim pravom možete biti ponosni što ćete pridonijeti realizaciji ove, istovremeno potresne i tople, knjige koja je prije svega - životna.</p>
<p><u> Napomena:</u> navedena knjiga u potpunosti će biti apolitična te ni na koji način neće biti nacionalno obojena. Takva su i pisma (na što sam jako ponosan na svoju tetu) te je moja dužnost i želja da knjiga bude isto takva. Za svakog čovjeka, nevezano koje je nacionalnosti, vjeroispovijesti i boje kože.</p>

<h3 align=""center""><i><strong><u>The discovery of the correspondence and the start of the project</u></strong></i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>''Although you probably  know quite a lot about the situation here –  the reality cannot be seen on TV or described – the only way to understand it is to experience it and stay alive in the process. I'm not usually the one to spread panic – but it's truly horrendous. Now I know what it means to struggle for existence...'' (09/22/1992)</strong></p>
<p>            Exactly one year ago, I managed to get a folder full of postal envelopes in my hands addsressed as ''Sarajevo Letters''. Each envelope contained a letter with a few additional letters. It did not take long for me to realize that I held a war correspondence (the breakup of Yugoslavia - Bosnian war) between my grandmother, who lived in Zagreb, and her sister who, as a Croat, moved to Sarajevo for love reasons in the 1960s. The latter sister and her husband, as well as all the other citizens of Sarajevo, were caught completely unprepared for war. Moreover, they were being on the front line of the battlefield (the border between Hrasno and Grbavica district – which was also the border between the two belligerent sides.). It was April 1992. They did not even suspect that it was about to happen one of the longest sieges in the history of modern warfare – that lasted full 44 months. Almost instantly, I began the process of transcription, not fully aware what kind of material is in my hands.</p>
<p><strong>''My husband has chopped up one wooden shelf which I used to cook in the pot on the balcony, with the sounds of grenades flying around. Everything I do, I do it crouching. Don't ask us how we wash our clothes or ourselves. I have not managed to take a single sedative or pill for high blood pressure. The bigger the impact of shooting  – the lower  blood pressure I have'' (9/22/1992)</strong></p>
<p>            After successful transcription of letters into a transparent digital format the results were the following: 130 full pages of stupendous text written in standard format (TNR; 12; 1,5). It was perfectly clear to me that it must not stop at this. At the beginning and with discretion, I mentioned my intentions to my closest relatives and friends. Encouraged by their reactions, I decided to contact several institutions which I thought might be interested in cooperation on this project. I am proud to say that I have received positive reactions from everyone and this way, I would like to express my gratitude to <strong>The History Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina</strong>, which offered its full support and cooperation on this project. <strong>( </strong><a href=""http://muzej.ba/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>http://muzej.ba/ )</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>''...yesterday, this dead man was lying for 2 hours in the middle of the forecourt. The first ten minutes, we were watching through our windows and then continued to talk and drink coffee. Two hours later, the shielded transporter arrived, threw a smoke bomb and took the dead and the wounded who strapped their legs themselves with belts and waited for the rescue to come. There was a little blood because sniper has hit him straight in the heart. Clearly they were some high quality snipers. The rain grenade intensity is falling, but now they have focused on the more precise way of killing the population.'' (05/27/1993)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><i><u><strong>About me</strong></u></i></h3>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>            I have a master's degree in History (currently in the postgraduate study of modern and contemporary history at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb.) My MA thesis was also based on a transcription of letters ( <a href=""https://zir.nsk.hr/islandora/object/hrstud%3A1150"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://zir.nsk.hr/islandora/object/hrstud%3A1150 )</a>, and it is precisely this coincidence that gives me more confidence and a positive feeling that this project is ‘destined’ to be fully realized.</p>
<p>      Apart from my master’s thesis, I have several other published works (e.g. <u><a href=""https://www.hrstud.unizg.hr/_download/repository/Lucius_sv._22_%282017%29.pdf.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.hrstud.unizg.hr/_download/repositor...</a>).</u></p>
<p>     The mentioned works had primarily scientific research approach, while this project will be fundamentally different and much closer to the popular literature.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><i><u><strong>How and why to support this project?</strong></u></i></h3>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p><strong>             </strong>Unfortunately, the situation in today's publishing world, as well as any formal support to emerging projects (books), is not very promising. Though not non-existent, the financial resources that can be expected in this way are not nearly enough to complete the project, especially the project of this kind. For this reason, I have decided to turn to<strong> </strong>all of you for help. The collected funds  will be used to cover the following costs:</p>
<p>• Travel and accommodation costs on the route: Zagreb-Sarajevo; Zagreb-Split; Zagreb-Rijeka; Zagreb - Belgrade. Due to the range of work and research, all these locations will be visited on multiple occasions (interviewing people mentioned in the letters, collecting old photos, photographing important locations and its present appearance, visits to various institutions, etc.)</p>
<p>• Fees for photographers, illustrators, lecturers and other associates who will have a lot of work</p>
<p>• Notary public and lawyer (copyright and text security)</p>
<p>• Possibility of independent production and issuing of the book</p>
<p>• All other additional, hidden costs that unfortunately always appear</p>
<p>            I've been trying to make the total amount claimed in the campaign as realistic as possible. I do not intend to make a profit, especially on you who really want to support this project. But, I also want to avoid insufficient funds that will leave the project unrealized or unfinished.  Since I am working on this project affected by strong emotions (because it is a family legacy), I will try to make this my prime work. Along with these resources, if we are able to collect them together - I believe it is possible!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><i><u><strong>What can we achieve?</strong></u></i></h3>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>            This title is not in plural by mistake. Without you, it would not be possible to make this project a quality work, or at all. Participating in this project, you will bring the world a book that places the common man and ordinary family in the swirl of a dirty war in the first place. A book that describes everyday survival  in a besieged city that lacks the basic means of living : water, food, electricity, gas, logs, money... A book that describes all the difficulties of apparently trivial things such as washing clothes, showering, heating, cooking ... A book that delivers food prices in the war, “war recipes” for meals, methods of survival when trying to go to the post office or at the market. In short, this will not be the book about politics, politicians, and war chronology, but about the consequences of the policy that “ordinary citizens experienced.”</p>
<p>          Number of books similar to this one is limited on the market, if any, especially those  that deal with topic of siege of Sarajevo. With full right, you can be proud of your contribution for the realization of this, at the same time moving and heartwarming  book that concerns primarily with life itself.</p>
<p>          <u>Note:</u> This book, along with letters,  will be fully apolitical and will not be nationally colored in any way. I feel very proud of my aunt and it is my duty and a great desire to make the book in the same tone - for every man, unrelated to the nationality, religion and color of the skin.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><i><u><strong>Challenges</strong></u></i></h3>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>            As with any project, it is very likely that at some point there will be certain obstacles. They can be of a financial nature, but also of various others: bureaucratic, creative etc. My obligation is, to all of you who will participate, to succeed and to realize this project.</p>
<p>          I work hard and I will continue to do so to minimize all possible difficulties and risks. While there is no guarantee that this campaign will be fully successful, I would like to thank all of you whose support I already have, but also to future supporters!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 align=""center""><i><u><strong>What else can you do to help?</strong></u></i></h3>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>            It is absolutely understandable if you are unable to financially assist in the realization of this book. In that case, you can support the project in the following ways:</p>
<p>• Share a campaign on your social networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram ...)</p>
<p>• Pass a campaign link to people you think might be interested in this project</p>
<p>• Your advice or information that could contribute to the overall quality of the final version of the text in the book</p>

""Iako mnogo sigurno znate o situaciji  ovdje - stvarnost se ne može vidjeti na TV-u ni ispričati. To treba proživjeti i preživjeti. Nisam baš paničar - ali stvarno je grozno. Sad znam šta znači golo preživljavanje za opstanak..."" (22/09/1992)
          Prije točno godinu dana, u moje ruke dospio je fascikl pun poštanskih kuverata na kojemu je pisalo ""Pisma Sarajevo."" U svakoj od kuverata nalazilo se pismo, s nekoliko dodatnih pisama bez svoje odgovarajuće ""kućice"". Nije trebalo dugo kako bih shvatio da u rukama držim ratnu korespondenciju (Raspad SFRJ - Rat u BiH) između moje bake koja je živjela u Zagrebu te njene sestre, koja je kao Hrvatica odselila u Sarajevo zbog ljubavi, davnih 1960-ih godina. Potonju sestru i njenog supruga, kao i sve ostale građane Sarajeva, rat je zatekao potpuno nespremne. U njihovom slučaju još i na prvoj crti bojišnice (granica između četvrti Hrasno i Grbavica - što je ujedno bila i granica između dviju zaraćenih strana.) Bio je to travanj 1992. godine. Nisu niti slutili što ih čeka u, pokazat će se, jednoj od najduljih opsada u povijesti modernog ratovanja - trajala je punih 44 mjeseci. Gotovo trenutačno, započeo sam proces transkribiranja navedenih pisama, ne shvaćajući u potpunosti ni sam kakav materijal držim u rukama.
""Moj muž je iscjepao jednu stalažu pa tako na drvcima na balkonu u posudi kuham, a granate fijuću okolo. Sve radim u čučećem položaju. Kako peremo sebe i veš - ne pitajte. Još nisam popila nijednu tabletu za smirenje, niti tablete za pritisak. Što je veće pucanje - kod mene manji pritisak!"" (22/09/1992)
          Nakon uspješnog transkribiranja (prepisivanja) pisama u pregledni, digitalni format, rezultati su bili sljedeći: punih 130 stranica zapanjujućeg teksta po standardnom formatu (TNR; 12; 1,5). Odmah mi je bilo jasno kako stvar ne smije ostati samo na tome. Oprezno u početku, najbližoj rodbini i prijateljima spomenuo sam svoje namjere. Ohrabren njihovim reakcijama (hvala svima na tome!), odlučio sam dalje kontaktirati i nekoliko institucija, za koje sam smatrao kako bi mogli biti zainteresirani za suradnju na ovom projektu. Moram ponosno reći kako sam i u tom pogledu sa svih strana dobio pozitivne reakcije, a posebnu zahvalu želim iskazati Historijskom muzeju BiH, koji je ponudio svoju punu podršku i suradnju na ovom projektu ( http://muzej.ba/ )
""...jučer je taj mrtav čovjek ležao 2 sata nasred dvorišta. Prvih deset minuta gledali smo kroz prozor, a onda smo nastavili pričati i piti kavu. Tek nakon dva sata je došao oklopni transporter. Bacili su dimnu zavjesu i izvukli i one mrtve i ranjene koji su sami sebi podvezali noge remenjem od hlača i čekali spas. Krvi je bilo malo jer ga je pogodio ravno u srce. Očito neki kvalitetni snajperista. Sad manje bacaju granate, ali su se dali na precizno ubijanje stanovništva."" (27/05/1993)

 
O meni
 
          Po struci magistar povijesti (trenutno na poslijediplomskom studiju moderne i suvremene povijesti na Filozofskom fakultetu u Zagrebu), magistrirao sam ni više ni manje nego baš na - korespondenciji ( https://zir.nsk.hr/islandora/object/hrstud%3A1150 .) Upravo mi ta slučajnost daje dodatno samopouzdanje, a donekle i onaj pozitivni osjećaj kako je ""suđeno"" da se ovaj projekt u potpunosti ostvari.
          Osim navedenog magistarskog rada, iza sebe imam još nekoliko objavljenih radova ( Npr: https://www.hrstud.unizg.hr/_download/repository/Lucius_sv._22_%282017%29.pdf.pdf ) Navedeni radovi primarno su imali znanstveno-istraživački pristup, dok će ovaj projekt biti u svojoj osnovi ipak nešto drugačiji te znatno bliži popularnoj literaturi.
 
Kako i zašto podržati ovaj projekt?
 
          Na žalost, situacija u današnjem nakladništvu, kao i bilo kakva formalna potpora projektima (knjigama) u nastajanju prilično je loša. Iako ne nepostojeća, financijska sredstva koja se mogu očekivati na taj način nisu ni blizu dostatna za dovršiti projekt, a posebno projekt ove vrste. Iz tog razloga odlučio sam se za pomoć obratiti svima Vama. Sredstva koja se prikupe biti će korištena da se pokriju sljedeći troškovi:

Trošak putovanja i smještaja na relaciji Zagreb - Sarajevo; Zagreb - Split; Zagreb-Rijeka; Zagreb - Beograd. Na sve navedene lokacije zbog opsega posla i istraživanja biti će potrebno ići u više navrata (intervjuiranje osoba koje se spominju u pismima, prikupljanje foto materijala iz ratnog perioda, fotografiranje bitnih lokacija i njihovog današnjeg izgleda, posjeta raznim institucijama itd...)
Honorar za fotografa, ilustratora, lektora i ostale suradnike koji će imati puno posla
Troškovi javnog bilježnika i pravnika (autorska prava i osiguravanje teksta)
Potencijalno samostalno izdavanje knjige, a svakako u najmanju ruku izrada i printanje nekoliko oglednih primjeraka
Svi ostali dodatni, skriveni troškovi koji se, na žalost - uvijek pojave

          Trudio sam se da ukupan iznos koji se potražuje u kampanji zaista bude što je moguće realniji. Nije mi namjera zaraditi na Vama koji iskreno želite podržati ovaj projekt, ali niti skromno odabrati iznos koji neće biti dostatan da se projekt napravi do kraja i kako treba. S obzirom da ovaj projekt radim i s velikom dozom emocija (jer se radi o obiteljskoj ostavštini), trudit ću se da kvaliteta zaista bude na razini. Uz navedena sredstva, ako ih zajedničkim snagama uspijemo prikupiti - vjerujem kako je upravo to i moguće!


 
Što možemo postići?
 
          Ovaj naslov nije slučajno u množini. Bez Vas ovaj projekt ne bi bilo moguće kvalitetno napraviti, a možda čak niti napraviti uopće. Vašim sudjelovanjem omogućit ćete da na svijet dođe knjiga koja na prvo mjesto stavlja običnog čovjeka i običnu obitelj koja se našla u vrtlogu prljavog rata. Knjiga koja opisuje svakodnevnicu preživljavanja u opkoljenom gradu u kojem mjesecima nema osnovnih sredstava za život: vode, hrane, struje, plina, drva, novca...Knjiga koja donosi i opisuje sve poteškoće oko naizgled banalnih stvari - pranja veša, tuširanja, grijanja, kuhanja...Knjiga koja donosi cijene namirnica u ratnom razdoblju, ""ratne recepte"" za jela, metode preživljavanja prilikom pokušaja odlaska na poštu ili na tržnicu. Ukratko, ovo će biti knjiga koja neće pisati o politici, političarima i ratnoj kronologiji, već o posljedicama te politike koje osjećaju ""obični građani.""
          Takvih knjiga na tržištu općenito je vrlo malo, a pogotovo ako uzmemo u obzir isključivo primjer opsade Sarajeva. S punim pravom možete biti ponosni što ćete pridonijeti realizaciji ove, istovremeno potresne i tople, knjige koja je prije svega - životna.
 Napomena: navedena knjiga u potpunosti će biti apolitična te ni na koji način neće biti nacionalno obojena. Takva su i pisma (na što sam jako ponosan na svoju tetu) te je moja dužnost i želja da knjiga bude isto takva. Za svakog čovjeka, nevezano koje je nacionalnosti, vjeroispovijesti i boje kože.


 
Izazovi
 
           Kao i kod svakog projekta, velika je vjerojatnost da se u nekom trenutku naiđe na određene prepreke. One mogu biti financijske prirode, ali i razne druge: birokratske, kreativne itd. Moja obaveza je prema svima Vama koji ćete u projektu sudjelovati (ili već na neki način sudjeluju), da se isti uspješno i privede kraju.
          Trudim se te ću se i dalje truditi kako bi sve moguće poteškoće i rizici bili svedeni na minimum. Iako nema garancije kako će ova kampanja biti u potpunosti uspješna, unaprijed se zahvaljujem svima Vama čiju podršku već imam, ali jednako tako i onima čiju podršku ću tek dobiti!
 
Kako još pomoći?
 
Potpuno je razumljivo ako niste u mogućnosti financijski pomoći realizaciju ove knjige. U tom slučaju, projekt možete podržati i na sljedeće načine:

Podijelite kampanju na svojim društvenim mrežama (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram...)
Proslijedite pojedinačno link za kampanju osobama za koje smatrate da bi ih ovaj projekt mogao zanimati

The discovery of the correspondence and the start of the project
 
''Although you probably  know quite a lot about the situation here –  the reality cannot be seen on TV or described – the only way to understand it is to experience it and stay alive in the process. I'm not usually the one to spread panic – but it's truly horrendous. Now I know what it means to struggle for existence...'' (09/22/1992)
            Exactly one year ago, I managed to get a folder full of postal envelopes in my hands addsressed as ''Sarajevo Letters''. Each envelope contained a letter with a few additional letters. It did not take long for me to realize that I held a war correspondence (the breakup of Yugoslavia - Bosnian war) between my grandmother, who lived in Zagreb, and her sister who, as a Croat, moved to Sarajevo for love reasons in the 1960s. The latter sister and her husband, as well as all the other citizens of Sarajevo, were caught completely unprepared for war. Moreover, they were being on the front line of the battlefield (the border between Hrasno and Grbavica district – which was also the border between the two belligerent sides.). It was April 1992. They did not even suspect that it was about to happen one of the longest sieges in the history of modern warfare – that lasted full 44 months. Almost instantly, I began the process of transcription, not fully aware what kind of material is in my hands.
''My husband has chopped up one wooden shelf which I used to cook in the pot on the balcony, with the sounds of grenades flying around. Everything I do, I do it crouching. Don't ask us how we wash our clothes or ourselves. I have not managed to take a single sedative or pill for high blood pressure. The bigger the impact of shooting  – the lower  blood pressure I have'' (9/22/1992)
            After successful transcription of letters into a transparent digital format the results were the following: 130 full pages of stupendous text written in standard format (TNR; 12; 1,5). It was perfectly clear to me that it must not stop at this. At the beginning and with discretion, I mentioned my intentions to my closest relatives and friends. Encouraged by their reactions, I decided to contact several institutions which I thought might be interested in cooperation on this project. I am proud to say that I have received positive reactions from everyone and this way, I would like to express my gratitude to The History Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which offered its full support and cooperation on this project. ( http://muzej.ba/ )
''...yesterday, this dead man was lying for 2 hours in the middle of the forecourt. The first ten minutes, we were watching through our windows and then continued to talk and drink coffee. Two hours later, the shielded transporter arrived, threw a smoke bomb and took the dead and the wounded who strapped their legs themselves with belts and waited for the rescue to come. There was a little blood because sniper has hit him straight in the heart. Clearly they were some high quality snipers. The rain grenade intensity is falling, but now they have focused on the more precise way of killing the population.'' (05/27/1993)
 
About me
 
            I have a master's degree in History (currently in the postgraduate study of modern and contemporary history at the University of Zagreb, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb.) My MA thesis was also based on a transcription of letters ( https://zir.nsk.hr/islandora/object/hrstud%3A1150 ), and it is precisely this coincidence that gives me more confidence and a positive feeling that this project is ‘destined’ to be fully realized.
      Apart from my master’s thesis, I have several other published works (e.g. https://www.hrstud.unizg.hr/_download/repositor...).
     The mentioned works had primarily scientific research approach, while this project will be fundamentally different and much closer to the popular literature.
 
How and why to support this project?
 
             Unfortunately, the situation in today's publishing world, as well as any formal support to emerging projects (books), is not very promising. Though not non-existent, the financial resources that can be expected in this way are not nearly enough to complete the project, especially the project of this kind. For this reason, I have decided to turn to all of you for help. The collected funds  will be used to cover the following costs:
• Travel and accommodation costs on the route: Zagreb-Sarajevo; Zagreb-Split; Zagreb-Rijeka; Zagreb - Belgrade. Due to the range of work and research, all these locations will be visited on multiple occasions (interviewing people mentioned in the letters, collecting old photos, photographing important locations and its present appearance, visits to various institutions, etc.)
• Fees for photographers, illustrators, lecturers and other associates who will have a lot of work
• Notary public and lawyer (copyright and text security)
• Possibility of independent production and issuing of the book
• All other additional, hidden costs that unfortunately always appear
            I've been trying to make the total amount claimed in the campaign as realistic as possible. I do not intend to make a profit, especially on you who really want to support this project. But, I also want to avoid insufficient funds that will leave the project unrealized or unfinished.  Since I am working on this project affected by strong emotions (because it is a family legacy), I will try to make this my prime work. Along with these resources, if we are able to collect them together - I believe it is possible!
 
What can we achieve?
 
            This title is not in plural by mistake. Without you, it would not be possible to make this project a quality work, or at all. Participating in this project, you will bring the world a book that places the common man and ordinary family in the swirl of a dirty war in the first place. A book that describes everyday survival  in a besieged city that lacks the basic means of living : water, food, electricity, gas, logs, money... A book that describes all the difficulties of apparently trivial things such as washing clothes, showering, heating, cooking ... A book that delivers food prices in the war, “war recipes” for meals, methods of survival when trying to go to the post office or at the market. In short, this will not be the book about politics, politicians, and war chronology, but about the consequences of the policy that “ordinary citizens experienced.”
          Number of books similar to this one is limited on the market, if any, especially those  that deal with topic of siege of Sarajevo. With full right, you can be proud of your contribution for the realization of this, at the same time moving and heartwarming  book that concerns primarily with life itself.
          Note: This book, along with letters,  will be fully apolitical and will not be nationally colored in any way. I feel very proud of my aunt and it is my duty and a great desire to make the book in the same tone - for every man, unrelated to the nationality, religion and color of the skin.
 
Challenges
 
            As with any project, it is very likely that at some point there will be certain obstacles. They can be of a financial nature, but also of various others: bureaucratic, creative etc. My obligation is, to all of you who will participate, to succeed and to realize this project.
          I work hard and I will continue to do so to minimize all possible difficulties and risks. While there is no guarantee that this campaign will be fully successful, I would like to thank all of you whose support I already have, but also to future supporters!
 
What else can you do to help?
 
            It is absolutely understandable if you are unable to financially assist in the realization of this book. In that case, you can support the project in the following ways:
• Share a campaign on your social networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram ...)
• Pass a campaign link to people you think might be interested in this project
• Your advice or information that could contribute to the overall quality of the final version of the text in the book
Thank you for your support!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It is the mid 1600’s. The Sultan of Hayat has conceived a contest shrouded in mystery. Applicants solely brandishing brawn and bravery are turned away. Those selected will learn the Sultan’s Three Wishes and their remarkable challenges, risking extended isolation in the palace if they fail at any stage. </p>
<p>So, when Safi, a poor farm boy, receives the Sultan’s approval, he is shocked. The first task appears to be impossible…to retrieve a ruby ring lost in the Igritis river 10 years before.  Will he succumb to his habitual self-doubt and give up? Is he tough or clever enough to survive encountering an alleged giant? Is he resourceful enough to confront a powerful hag and acquire her magical elixir for the Sultan? Safi ignores the risks he will face in the hope that he might win the monetary prize that will save his critically ill aunt and uplift his family. </p>
<p>During his journey, Safi encounters several extraordinary beings like the genderless sage, Nujoum, who authored the cryptic manuscript in his possession; the giant who fervently guards an enchanted well; the four mystics who are expecting him; and the feared hag who lives in the Mountains of Mist.</p>
<p>Between the incredible completion of each wish, Safi rests for a day in the palace where he meets and falls for the raven-haired princess Jameela. He learns of her progressive ideas, her skills as a swordswoman and her daring to disguise herself as a boy to rescue orphans from hopeless circumstances.</p>
<p>The incredible connections that slowly unfold between Safi, the Sultan, the people he meets and events during his journey rewrite his understanding of life. Through the Three Wishes we learn how destiny, personal choice, and a benevolent universe collaborate to teach us life lessons. Safi is awakened to a world beyond human sight. Learning to cultivate self-trust, his confidence and character mature. Inspirational people and themes are woven throughout.</p>

<p><i>So You’ve Been Diagnosed with Cancer and Now You’re In A Panic Handbook </i>is an easy-to-read 75 page booklet with an overview of treatment options, designed to be a great starting point for someone who has been diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p>I’m Dr. Leyla Ali, I’m a pharmacist and author. I’ve been a pharmacist for 20 years, and I’ve seen people struggle with health conditions, taking medication after medication only to get sicker and sicker. I then took time to learn about holistic and natural healthcare options. When I studied these, I learned that our medical professionals are no longer being trained in the basics of health. As a result, people are struggling for YEARS with their health when they don’t need to; when their health would be much better served with a more holistic and natural approach.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diabetes costs on average about $16,000 per patient per year. It is an expensive and very difficult disease to live with, including a strict diet, testing the blood glucose sometimes several times per day, and taking medications regularly. But often diabetes can be reversed in a matter of weeks.</li>
<li>Pain often causes patients to struggle and suffer for years. Standard medical doctors often only offer narcotic pain medications and surgery. Addictions to opiates ruin lives, and this is now making headlines and recognized to be an epidemic. Yet there are a lot of ways to relieve pain, including acupuncture, hypnotherapy, muscle releasing techniques, to name a few. Yet these are typically not offered to patients in standard medical care.</li>
<li>Cancer is another area where medical doctors only provide a limited perspective and options, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Yet there is so much more that can help.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>So You’ve Been Diagnosed with Cancer and Now You’re in a Panic Handbook</i> includes information about your health and cancer that is not readily available from most medical doctors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutrition</li>
<li>Detoxification</li>
<li>Emotional Health</li>
<li>Power of the Mind</li>
<li>Natural Products</li>
<li>Cannabis</li>
<li>Cancer Free Lifestyle</li>
<li>Treatment Options</li>
<li>Theories on Cancer</li>
<li>Other Resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery have become the standard treatment options recommended by medical doctors. The reason is because the pharmaceutical industries have a large influence on the education system of medical doctors and pharmacists.</p>
<p><strong>Read this booklet to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>gain an understanding of the many facets of health and cancer,</li>
<li>learn about an overview of the different treatment options available to you.</li>
<li>understand what you can expect from your medical doctors, as well as their limitations.</li>
<li>learn where you can get resources for more information.</li>
<li>get information on cancer treatment centers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Funds we receive will be for printing costs and promote to get the word out.</p>
<p>Ten percent of proceeds will go to the charitable partners listed below.</p>
<p>We appreciate each and every dollar we receive!</p>
<p><strong>Charitable Partners</strong></p>
<p><i>Optimum Health Institute</i> is a holistic healing program for over 40 years located in San Diego, California and Austin, Texas.

<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<li>I didn’t learn the basics of health in pharmacy school: I didn't learn anything about nutrition, or emotional health, or natural products or herbal remedies. Only drugs.</li>
<li>People depended upon me as a healthcare practitioner.</li>
<li>When I went beyond pharmacy school and learned about holistic and natural health care, I found people that were able to heal themselves from health conditions that pharmacy customers literally struggle with for years. These include pain, diabetes, addictions, chronic fatigue, depression, neuropathy, and cancer, and many other chronic conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have made it my mission to help people find more natural and holistic solutions for their health conditions where doctors and drugs fall short.</p>
<p>My first book is <i>Off Balance, The American Way of Health, A Pharmacist’s Perspective on Why Drugs Don’t Work. </i></p>
<p>And my second book coming out soon is: <i>Off Balance 2, Adventures in a Mail Order Pharmacy</i></p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>My biggest challenge is marketing and spreading the word. Back in 2012 I finished my first book with a big “Ta Da!” and there were only crickets. Then I started reading and learning about all the things I need to do to market and promote and build my audience.</p>
<p>I’m confident the information in my first book and this booklet are useful and insightful, but the biggest challenge for me is marketing and promotion. I’ve learned a lot since then. So I plan to spread the word by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reaching out to groups</li>

<li>Giving lectures</li>

</div></div>","So You’ve Been Diagnosed with Cancer and Now You’re In A Panic Handbook is an easy-to-read 75 page booklet with an overview of treatment options, designed to be a great starting point for someone who has been diagnosed with cancer.
I’m Dr. Leyla Ali, I’m a pharmacist and author. I’ve been a pharmacist for 20 years, and I’ve seen people struggle with health conditions, taking medication after medication only to get sicker and sicker. I then took time to learn about holistic and natural healthcare options. When I studied these, I learned that our medical professionals are no longer being trained in the basics of health. As a result, people are struggling for YEARS with their health when they don’t need to; when their health would be much better served with a more holistic and natural approach.
Examples:

Diabetes costs on average about $16,000 per patient per year. It is an expensive and very difficult disease to live with, including a strict diet, testing the blood glucose sometimes several times per day, and taking medications regularly. But often diabetes can be reversed in a matter of weeks.
Pain often causes patients to struggle and suffer for years. Standard medical doctors often only offer narcotic pain medications and surgery. Addictions to opiates ruin lives, and this is now making headlines and recognized to be an epidemic. Yet there are a lot of ways to relieve pain, including acupuncture, hypnotherapy, muscle releasing techniques, to name a few. Yet these are typically not offered to patients in standard medical care.
Cancer is another area where medical doctors only provide a limited perspective and options, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Yet there is so much more that can help.

So You’ve Been Diagnosed with Cancer and Now You’re in a Panic Handbook includes information about your health and cancer that is not readily available from most medical doctors, including:

Nutrition
Detoxification
Emotional Health
Power of the Mind
Natural Products
Cannabis
Cancer Free Lifestyle
Treatment Options
Theories on Cancer
Other Resources

Chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery have become the standard treatment options recommended by medical doctors. The reason is because the pharmaceutical industries have a large influence on the education system of medical doctors and pharmacists.
Read this booklet to:

gain an understanding of the many facets of health and cancer,
learn about an overview of the different treatment options available to you.
understand what you can expect from your medical doctors, as well as their limitations.
learn where you can get resources for more information.
get information on cancer treatment centers.

They also answer many calls each day, giving direction and hope to those in need.

<h3>About the Funds</h3>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>We've created something that's never been done before.  We call it a ""BookVerse"".  <b>And its owned and driven by storytellers.</b></p>
<p>Star Wars, Star Trek, Conan... those are trademark ""franchises"" owned and managed by giants.  Not that they aren't kind of cool, but they are managed by corporations that hire writers to pump out stories where nothing ever really happens.  Where there's no danger, no change... no consequences.  In short, nothing to get excited about.   Sure, the characters go on adventures and villains die, but, <b>we all know that earth-shattering game-changers rarely happen.</b></p>
<p>It's a reality that many brand worlds are driven by sales numbers and not what's best for the story. Decisions are made, not because they serve the story, raise the stakes, or give the reader an unforgettable adventure that'll change them forever and leave them tattooed with the marks of a great tale. </p>
<p>We, Wonderment Media, want to make ""story"" the building block of our DNA. </p>
<p>We're looking to take our characters and our world and break it for your amusement.  We're looking to wreck stuff and let you have fun reading it.  We're building something... and we're tearing it apart.  It's called <b><i>The Apocalypse Weird</i></b>.  It's run <i>by</i> writers so writers and readers can finally do what they've wanted to do regardless of some ""bottom line"" that saves us from the consequences of great storytelling.  What we're doing is  <b>dangerous</b>, but we think <b>that's where the fun is.</b>  </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What is the Apocalypse Weird?  It's Lost meets the End of Civilization.  It's the Island in the middle of suburbia coming apart at the seams of reality.  It's kinda like King's Dark Tower, but a whole lot stranger.  But, most importantly, it's a story for readers and lovers of books like something that's never been done before.  </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It's dangerous, thrilling and it's definitely Weird.  We even have a <b>FREE</b> introductory novel called <b><a href=""http://www.apocalypseweird.com/the-red-king"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Apocalypse Weird: The Red King</a></b> to get you started.<br/></span></p>
<p>But don't worry, we're not just making it up as we go.  We have <b>a five year story arc</b> that's going to take our heroes, and villains, on a very strange and WYRD adventure.  And at the end, it will resound in <b>a stunning conclusion</b> that will leave its mark on the publishing world, and <i>you </i>the reader.  </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">In February of 2015, Wonderment Media did something that, as far as we know, had never been done before. As a start-up publishing company, we </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">launched 5 weird post-apocalyptic novels</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> (all written in the same Apocalypse Weird brand universe, but by different authors) on the </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">same day.</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p>With our launch novels we built a Sandbox, a carefully orchestrated collection of overlapping possibilities, where readers can come in and watch the adventures of small bands of survivors as they attempt to survive the catastrophic events taking place.  Here, the machinations of 88 demons will tear them apart, and bring them together, forging a whole new reality within the Apocalypse Weird.  <br/></p>
<p>We've already put out <b>9 full novels</b>, and we're launching two more books a month for the next five years!  As of right now we have over <b>571 reviews</b> on Amazon, collectively, and books 11 and 12 are in final production now.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary We've created something that's never been done before.  We call it a ""BookVerse"".  And its owned and driven by storytellers.
Star Wars, Star Trek, Conan... those are trademark ""franchises"" owned and managed by giants.  Not that they aren't kind of cool, but they are managed by corporations that hire writers to pump out stories where nothing ever really happens.  Where there's no danger, no change... no consequences.  In short, nothing to get excited about.   Sure, the characters go on adventures and villains die, but, we all know that earth-shattering game-changers rarely happen.
It's a reality that many brand worlds are driven by sales numbers and not what's best for the story. Decisions are made, not because they serve the story, raise the stakes, or give the reader an unforgettable adventure that'll change them forever and leave them tattooed with the marks of a great tale. 
We, Wonderment Media, want to make ""story"" the building block of our DNA. 
We're looking to take our characters and our world and break it for your amusement.  We're looking to wreck stuff and let you have fun reading it.  We're building something... and we're tearing it apart.  It's called The Apocalypse Weird.  It's run by writers so writers and readers can finally do what they've wanted to do regardless of some ""bottom line"" that saves us from the consequences of great storytelling.  What we're doing is  dangerous, but we think that's where the fun is.  
What is the Apocalypse Weird?  It's Lost meets the End of Civilization.  It's the Island in the middle of suburbia coming apart at the seams of reality.  It's kinda like King's Dark Tower, but a whole lot stranger.  But, most importantly, it's a story for readers and lovers of books like something that's never been done before.  
It's dangerous, thrilling and it's definitely Weird.  We even have a FREE introductory novel called Apocalypse Weird: The Red King to get you started.
But don't worry, we're not just making it up as we go.  We have a five year story arc that's going to take our heroes, and villains, on a very strange and WYRD adventure.  And at the end, it will resound in a stunning conclusion that will leave its mark on the publishing world, and you the reader.  
In February of 2015, Wonderment Media did something that, as far as we know, had never been done before. As a start-up publishing company, we launched 5 weird post-apocalyptic novels (all written in the same Apocalypse Weird brand universe, but by different authors) on the same day. 
With our launch novels we built a Sandbox, a carefully orchestrated collection of overlapping possibilities, where readers can come in and watch the adventures of small bands of survivors as they attempt to survive the catastrophic events taking place.  Here, the machinations of 88 demons will tear them apart, and bring them together, forging a whole new reality within the Apocalypse Weird.  
We've already put out 9 full novels, and we're launching two more books a month for the next five years!  As of right now we have over 571 reviews on Amazon, collectively, and books 11 and 12 are in final production now.


Everything the industry has said can't be done, Wonderment Media and our growing stable of talented authors is doing.
They said an author can only write one GOOD book a year - well, that is nonsense. They said readers don't want ""different,"" and that a MARVEL-like connected world could not work in literature. They said ""releasing books like TV producers release episodes will never work."" 
But, we've done it just that -- and we need your help to keep on doing it.
We've proven the concept, now we want to take it to the next level.  We want to push out more books, hire more writers, pay artists, editors, and professionals, and deliver the absolutely best literary entertainment out there.

With  10 books out to date, not only are readers embracing a new and exciting way to receive their kind of stories, but they are eager for more. 
So now we want to fund our Apocalypse Weird project through the end of the year!
This means we'll be handing out more writing contracts, paying indie artists, freelance editors, and more.  We'll be giving readers more good stuff to read, one Apocalypse at a time.
What We Need & What You Get
 
Our goal is to raise $10,000 as a bare minimum to help us expand and meet expenses as we grow. This means paying our super-talented cover artist and our awesome editors. And it means more money for marketing and promoting our books! To get to our goal, we're offering a bunch of pretty awesome stuff including  signed books and posters, special edition prints, limited run hard backs, and even more great perks. We have every expectation of meeting our funding goal, but even if we don't, the funds we do raise are going to operating expenses, promotion, and marketing. 

We're going to make this concept work, and believe me, our way is the way publishing will be done in the future!   The Impact So many of the stories we see or read on television and in books are driven by committees within big Corporations using spreadsheets and computers that focus only on the bottom line.  Big corporations don't always think of the story and the reader first.  These writer-gobbling giants too often make crucial storytelling decisions based on ""data"" or business decisions that have nothing to do with the story or what the readers want out of their fiction.  
The Apocalypse Weird is driven by writers who are storytellers.  We think that makes for better storytelling that won't pull punches and won't hesitate to go places other corporations might be to afraid to go.  The impact will be incredible within the books, the Sandbox we're developing, and the publishing community as writers finally take back the reins of their stories that are too often surrendered in the name of corporate greed.
Wonderment is proving that developing new authors while demanding high production quality, rapid pacing, and fair contracts CAN and SHOULD be the new path for publishing.
    Risks & Challenges The Challenge for us is to continue to produce high quality manuscripts that look and read like something the The Big Five Publishers would be proud to distribute.  We believe that you get what you pay for. 
To that end we've hired editorial staff, professional formatters, and the THE BEST cover and interior artists.  We've paid them what they're worth instead of trying to get by with less.   Take a look at our launch books and check out the reviews - our high standards are definitely paying off.  
But to do this requires enough cash flow to keep all of this going in between earnings checks from Amazon and other retailers.  We know it will take a year until our cash flow balances.  We are raising money so we can continue producing top quality books.
We have the talent, the stories, the method, and the pipeline to make this effort work -- we're doing it right now.  We need your help to keep doing it.
    Other Ways You Can Help We don't just want to make some money.  We want to entertain you.  Take our free novel and give it an honest read.  We've even hidden some fun little surprises within, so make sure to follow the rabbit trails you find.  Then talk about it and share it. Also, meet us over at Apocalypse Weird on Facebook and talk with the actual writers.  Tell them which characters you like and what you'd like to see happen.  Encourage them because writing is a lonely business.  We even have a place where you might write a little fan fiction if you're so inclined... to get caught up in the action.  
In short, come join the movement to build the next BIG thing in Digital Publishing.  Come go where no readers or writers have ever ever gone before.  Come and explore the Apocalypse Weird.

a science-fiction book? Would you like to see it all bound
together with the ancient Kabbalah? And see it all through the eyes of
Destiny ? If so, ME TOO!</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Keren Naor, and I'm an aspiring author. <strong>I need
your help in launching my book!</strong> </p>
<p>The book is a <em>matrix</em> of several areas of interest,
primarily: </p>
<p>1) The Theory of <strong>Relativity</strong> of Albert Einstein &amp;
Astro-Physics, </p>
<p>2) <strong>Kabbalah</strong>, </p>
<p>3) <strong>Destiny &amp; Faith. </strong></p>
<p>The main character of the book, the heroine, shall have a strong Feministic
approach to life &amp; will be a brave character (or forced to be brave by
circumstance...you decide....). She will be amazing, especially in dealing with
our world as it is today! She &amp; her life are at the center of the
book, together with the unique events she goes through in her life. I
will mention, though, that I intend the heroine to be accompanied by some
special characters and an intriguing story-line.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do I Need Your Help?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, I am an aspiring author. In order to make the book excellent, I
need time to finish the extensive research needed for it. But as you can guess,
I have bills to pay &amp; rent.</p>
<p>These days, I am supported by unemployment benefits, which will soon end. I

like science and are open minded.</p>
<p>I wish that you could see the beauty of the book as I see it, and let me

<h3>More Details: What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The financial goal for this project was calculated the following way: it is
the amount I need for my living expenses for <b>two years</b>; also the money
is intended to pay for <b>editing</b> the book &amp; adding <strong>professional</strong>
 <b>drawings</b> to it. </p>
<p>The goal of the project was calculated in a very conservative way i.e.
according to my basic expenses in the month of April 2015. The expenses are not
supposed to change very much in the coming two years. Basically, they’re
supposed to pay for my rent, taxes, and credit cards, in addition to groceries.
And as mentioned, I intend to have the book edited, and get professional
drawings for the book, at least for the beginning of each chapter. </p>
<p>I really hope that you will support my goal! I absolutely know that <strong>being
an author is my life’s destiny</strong>…</p>
<p>You can expect to get your perk within one to two years. I will do a
fabulous job on the book, &amp; on the extensive research needed for it. I
truly believe that my idea is really unique. I keep the content of the book a
bit mysterious in order to protect my ideas &amp; copyrights. I hope that you
can identify with that.</p>
<p><b>You could really enjoy the perks I’m offering, and have a piece of
history in your hand:</b> From having a PDF copy of the book, to owning a
printed copy of it; from getting a personalized Thank-you note from me, to
enjoying a Skype conversation with me on the book &amp; its writing process…
And the last but not least perk, is perhaps the most interesting one: having your
OWN NAME appear in the book as a <strong>character</strong> (I still don't know
exactly which one) (you'll appear in ALL the copies of the book!). </p>
<p>I just want to mention, that even if the project’s goal is not met, I will
write the book anyway, for those who believed in me, only it will be much
harder, and might take longer. So please, MAKE MY DREAM COME TRUE!!! </p>

<p><b>FAMILY,
MENTAL HEALTH &amp; POLTERGEISTS</b></p>
<p>Hotep, Good People!<span>  I launched this campaign to take pre-orders
for my first novel, <i>The Basement</i>.  Among other things - i.e. coach,
entrepreneur, father, group exercise instructor, speaker, etc. - I teach
Business Law, Constitutional Law, Criminal Justice and Political Science at a
college in Northern Virginia.  As an
author, I have already published three children’s books, a collection of poetry
and a volume of essays exploring the social and political dynamics of being
black in America.  In fact, this story
sets the stage for a continuum exploring the various dimensions African
American families.  What it means to be
family … what it takes to keep a marriage or family or both together … the role
of family in identifying and dealing with mental health issues … bonds of
brotherhood and affection among black men are just some of the themes illustrated
in these stories.  Plus, including The
Basement, my upcoming novels span the genres of crime fiction, horror, thriller
and science fiction.  It is going to be a
fun and informative ride, and <i>The Basement</i>
serves as the jump-off!  </span></p>
<p><i>The Basement</i> tells the story of Greg Dennis
whose deceased father-in-law returns as a poltergeist occupying the basement of
Greg’s new home.<span>  As a poltergeist, the
father-in-law creates all types of havoc throughout the house, including
stirring up dissension between Greg and his beloved wife, Drissa.  When the vengeful spirit's true plans come to
light - i.e. namely returning to life by taking total possession of someone who
resides in the house, Greg takes decisive action to end the haunting.  <i>The
Basement</i> also touches on a subject that receives far too little attention,
mental illness in the black community. 
Millions of Americans face their own mental health issues or those of a
loved one.  In Black America, discussing
mental illness has long been considered taboo. 
Hopefully, <i>The Basement</i> will
make this subject just a little bit easier for all American families, and
especially African American families, to bring out of the shadows and address
as a family unit.  Just like “it takes
a village to raise a child,” people facing the seemingly insurmountable
challenge of living with a loved one who exhibits a pattern of behavior similar
to the traits of a mental condition like borderline personality disorder truly
need consistent support and affirmation from family members, friends and mental
health professionals.  <i>The Basement </i>seeks to both entertain and
inform its readers.</span></p><p><br/><span>
</span></p><p><b>Plot
Synopsis</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Gregory Oyauma Dennis always wanted his own family.<span>  More than anything, he wanted to prove he
could transcend his parents failed marriage and give his own children what his
parents could not or would not give to him, a home with both mommy and
daddy.  The first time Greg laid eyes on
Drissa Butler, he felt as though he were looking directly into his future.  In fact, the attraction between Greg and
Drissa was more than immediately mutual, it was palpable.  Greg and Drissa fell hard and swiftly for
each other.  Unfortunately, Drissa’s reverend
father, Bishop Jab Butler, disapproved of Greg and Drissa’s relationship.  Greg’s perspective on life clashed with
Bishop Butler’s teachings concerning <i>the
walk of a godly man</i>.  By the time
Greg and Drissa married, Bishop Butler developed Stage IV Lymphoma, and after
years of an active ostracization campaign toward Greg within the family and the
church community, Bishop Butler died. 
Drissa seemed to take her father’s death the hardest.  In her mourning, Drissa began to feel her
father’s presence in her home with Greg. 
Drissa was not the only member of the Dennis household to feel the
presence of the deceased bishop’s spirit. 
When his daughter began to report late night visits from PaPa, Greg
realized that perhaps the bishop’s presence might be more than a simple
perception.  No sooner than Greg came to
this realization, the vengeful poltergeist transformed the basement of Greg and
Drissa’s home into a portal to the spiritual plain.  When the spirit of Bishop Butler challenges
Greg to a final confrontation for the hearts and possibly the souls of Greg’s
wife and daughter, Greg realizes that he may have to sacrifice himself to save
his family.  </span></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>PERKS, PRIZES &amp; SPECIAL OFFERS</b></p>
<p>The primary focus of this campaign is to gain
pre-orders for <i>The Basement</i>.<span>  I am more interested in building excitement
for the book than I am in making money in this stage of the game.  Making money is always nice, but I am looking
at the long game right now.  Having said
that, here’s what you get for supporting this campaign:</span></p>
<p><b>$3 Holla</b>:<span>  Maybe you don’t get into horror stories.  Perhaps you would rather wait for the release
party or one of the tour events to meet me in person.  For whatever reason, you would rather support
the campaign without receiving a book. 
That’s Kool N’ tha Gang!  This
contribution level comes with a thank you note, a book mark, your name on the
Thank You’s page of my website and my quarterly newsletter, Old Skool Updates
(which you can opt out of at any time. 
Trust me; if you decide to opt out of the newsletter, I won’t take it
personal … LoL).  </span></p>

you’ll get an eBook copy of <i>The Basement</i>
in your choice of format (i.e. ePub, mobi, etc.) ahead of the release
date.  That’s right!  Exclusive to this campaign, eBook pre-orders
will be available on July 31<sup>st</sup>, a full week before the rest of the world
can get it.</span></p>
<p><b>Special Edition The Basement eBook</b>:<span>  In addition to the perks from the $3 Holla,
you’ll get an eBook copy of <i>The Basement</i>

AWARENESS<br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>According
to research psychologists Jean Twenge and Keith Campbell, approximately 6% of
the US population suffers from narcissistic personality disorder.<span>  When you consider that the people with the disorder
generally come in contact with family, friends and co-workers, the impact of
the disorder on American society increases exponentially.  The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)
describes narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) as a pervasive mental
disorder characterized by the following symptoms (among others):  (a) a grandiose sense of self-importance
(e.g. an expectation to be recognized as superior without corresponding
achievements); (b) a general lack of empathy with regard to the feelings or
needs of others; and (c) an envy of others or a distorted belief that others
are envious of her or him.  Wider studies
have concluded that 62% of people with NPD are men.  People suffering from NPD level various forms
of mental abuse as well as attempts to exert emotional or, even, physical
control over other people close to them including children, employees and
spouses.  The abuse sustained from a
narcissist present long-lasting traumatic effects on the victim.  In addition to physical abuse, victims of
narcissistic behavior suffer a total loss of self-esteem.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately,
for many African Americans, psychotherapy remains taboo.<span>  Many black Americans attempt to dismiss
disturbing behavior patterns as undesirable personality traits rather than
symptoms of a personality disorder. 
Whether for themselves or a loved one, African Americans shun seeking
treatment from a licensed mental health professional.  Using the example of a narcissistic father
who becomes an entitled poltergeist, <i>The
Basement</i> attempts to employ the technique of <i>edu-tainment</i> to draw correlations between abusive behaviors and
personality disorders.  This book also
seeks to destigmatize mental health services among African Americans.  </span></p>

<p></p></div>","FAMILY,
MENTAL HEALTH & POLTERGEISTS
Hotep, Good People!  I launched this campaign to take pre-orders
for my first novel, The Basement.  Among other things - i.e. coach,
entrepreneur, father, group exercise instructor, speaker, etc. - I teach
Business Law, Constitutional Law, Criminal Justice and Political Science at a
college in Northern Virginia.  As an
author, I have already published three children’s books, a collection of poetry
and a volume of essays exploring the social and political dynamics of being
black in America.  In fact, this story
sets the stage for a continuum exploring the various dimensions African
American families.  What it means to be
family … what it takes to keep a marriage or family or both together … the role
of family in identifying and dealing with mental health issues … bonds of
brotherhood and affection among black men are just some of the themes illustrated
in these stories.  Plus, including The
Basement, my upcoming novels span the genres of crime fiction, horror, thriller
and science fiction.  It is going to be a
fun and informative ride, and The Basement
serves as the jump-off!  
The Basement tells the story of Greg Dennis
whose deceased father-in-law returns as a poltergeist occupying the basement of
Greg’s new home.  As a poltergeist, the
father-in-law creates all types of havoc throughout the house, including
stirring up dissension between Greg and his beloved wife, Drissa.  When the vengeful spirit's true plans come to
light - i.e. namely returning to life by taking total possession of someone who
resides in the house, Greg takes decisive action to end the haunting.  The
Basement also touches on a subject that receives far too little attention,
mental illness in the black community. 
Millions of Americans face their own mental health issues or those of a
loved one.  In Black America, discussing
mental illness has long been considered taboo. 
Hopefully, The Basement will
make this subject just a little bit easier for all American families, and
especially African American families, to bring out of the shadows and address
as a family unit.  Just like “it takes
a village to raise a child,” people facing the seemingly insurmountable
challenge of living with a loved one who exhibits a pattern of behavior similar
to the traits of a mental condition like borderline personality disorder truly
need consistent support and affirmation from family members, friends and mental
health professionals.  The Basement seeks to both entertain and
inform its readers.
Plot
Synopsis

Gregory Oyauma Dennis always wanted his own family.  More than anything, he wanted to prove he
could transcend his parents failed marriage and give his own children what his
parents could not or would not give to him, a home with both mommy and
daddy.  The first time Greg laid eyes on
Drissa Butler, he felt as though he were looking directly into his future.  In fact, the attraction between Greg and
Drissa was more than immediately mutual, it was palpable.  Greg and Drissa fell hard and swiftly for
each other.  Unfortunately, Drissa’s reverend
father, Bishop Jab Butler, disapproved of Greg and Drissa’s relationship.  Greg’s perspective on life clashed with
Bishop Butler’s teachings concerning the
walk of a godly man.  By the time
Greg and Drissa married, Bishop Butler developed Stage IV Lymphoma, and after
years of an active ostracization campaign toward Greg within the family and the
church community, Bishop Butler died. 
Drissa seemed to take her father’s death the hardest.  In her mourning, Drissa began to feel her
father’s presence in her home with Greg. 
Drissa was not the only member of the Dennis household to feel the
presence of the deceased bishop’s spirit. 
When his daughter began to report late night visits from PaPa, Greg
realized that perhaps the bishop’s presence might be more than a simple
perception.  No sooner than Greg came to
this realization, the vengeful poltergeist transformed the basement of Greg and
Drissa’s home into a portal to the spiritual plain.  When the spirit of Bishop Butler challenges
Greg to a final confrontation for the hearts and possibly the souls of Greg’s
wife and daughter, Greg realizes that he may have to sacrifice himself to save
his family.  

FINANCING
THE FINAL STAGES OF THE RELEASE

All funds raised through this campaign will be
used for the following.  
The Basement will be released on 7 August
2015!  Here is what needs to be done
before that date:
1.  Manuscript needs to be
submitted for final edit. 
2.  The front and back cover for
the paperback version still needs to be designed.  
3.  Register the manuscript with
the US Copyright Office.
4.  Order the first round of
printing.
In addition to what I need, here is what I would
like to do:

1.  Hire a production company to
create a book trailer.
2.  Host an official release party.
3.  Launch a four-city book tour -
Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans and New York (For every $750 this campaign receives
over the goal, I will add another city). 

PERKS, PRIZES & SPECIAL OFFERS
The primary focus of this campaign is to gain
pre-orders for The Basement.  I am more interested in building excitement
for the book than I am in making money in this stage of the game.  Making money is always nice, but I am looking
at the long game right now.  Having said
that, here’s what you get for supporting this campaign:

party or one of the tour events to meet me in person.  For whatever reason, you would rather support
the campaign without receiving a book.

available through this Indiegogo campaign. 
And, once this perk sells out, the preview will be gone forever.
Autographed Paperback:  In addition to the perks from the $3 Holla,
you’ll get one paperback copy of The
Basement personally signed by me.

mailing labels and slap them to the inside cover.  Your copy of The Basement will be shipped to you on Friday, July 31st,

date. 
1 eBook + 1 Paperback:  In addition to the perks from the $3 Holla,

</div></div>","Short Summary Texts from Mittens began as a column on Catster.com in 2013, and because readers fell in love with Mittens, the overly-dramatic texting cat, I created textsfrommittens.com later that year. Due to a quickly growing readership and requests from readers, Texts from Mittens became a book (Harlequin Nonfiction) on March 31, 2015. 


I've funded my own small book tour (here it is), with limited cities. Because readers have asked, and I've wanted to get out there, I want to expand the tour. My travel budget has hit its limit, so this is why I created this campaign.



Book Description:
Texts from Mittens is a series of text message conversations between a snappy, self-absorbed house cat named Mittens and his long-suffering human, a single woman who works away from home during the day. Mittens relentlessly hassles his human all day long, while only taking breaks to watch Judge Judy, hang with his best friend Stumpy, complain about the antics of Drunk Patty the neighbor, ask Grandma for money to buy useless items from QVC, and harass the ""filthy beast"" dog, Phil.




What We Need & What You Get I polled the Mittens readers on Facebook about the cities they'd like to see included on an expanded tour, and ranked a list of proposed stops, based on popularity and cost-effectiveness (I don't require lodging or car rental at several of the stops). The amount raised will determine which stops are included, starting with no. 1. If I make the entire goal, all the stops will be added! If we exceed the goal, I'm open to adding cities.
Stops, by rank are:
1. Austin/Houston, TX
2. NYC and surrounding area 
3. St. Augustine/Tampa, FL
4. DC and surrounding area 
5. Phoenix, AZ
6. Seattle, WA
7. Chicago, IL/Detroit, MI
8. Atlanta, GA
The average for each trip is $1,000 -- some a little less, some a little more, depending on what's required at the stop.



Each trip includes airfare.


Some require car rental.


Some require a short hotel stay, but most include free lodging with friends or family.


Each trip includes applicable parking, public transportation fees, food, gas, and costs associated with events.


Each trip includes a donation to an animal rescue in each city (amount and rescues names TBD).


The trips will take place in the fall of 2015, between August and November -- actual dates and schedules are TBD. Again, the stops will happen according to amount raised and rank of stop on list. 
At this time, I'm scheduling US stops only. 
In addition to lots of additional stops to connect with Mittens readers, there are some cool perks available at each donation level.

    The Impact I'll get to meet Mittens readers from may areas of the country, visit, and sign books. This will be huge fun for me, and hopefully a good time for the readers as well!
Have little judge's robe, bags of nip, going-to-town shoes ... and willing to travel.


Recent Events -- Fun!
Here are some photos from recent signings and readings, which have been successful and well-attended. The expanded tour will include more of the same!

The role that made Eric famous was as the trail boss Gil Favor in Rawhide, which was the sixth highest rated TV show according to the Nielsen ratings.

Next, I describe how Eric and I accidentally met on a blind date set-up by his Rawhide co-star Clint Eastwood.</p><p>In addition to information about our years living together and  becoming engaged, the factual tale culminates with his tragic and unnecessary death filming a movie on a tributary of the Amazon River in Peru. Attempting to meet budget constraints and to finish filming despite inclement weather, the movie's director decided to film the final scene in the Amazon River despite pleas from indigenous Amazonians that the formidable rapids weren't negotiable due to recent flooding. <br/><br/>I didn't write the story with the intention of it being an official biography. Instead, this is the account of our three wonderful and inseparable years together. We encountered a myriad of unimaginable events that I describe in the story. Perhaps the truth about Eric will reverse the confident judgments made by journalists who never talked to Eric, and made up facts to suit their publications.<br/><br/><strong>THE BOOK</strong><br/>To the public, Eric Fleming was a major television star. Unknown to his adoring fans was his life actually comprised a sequence of calamities that only a truly strong, rugged person could endure. To state his life's struggles resembled the biblical Job - one ordeal after another - would be an understatement. <br/><br/>Eric Fleming: Death On the Amazon (DOA) presents my personal insights into a complex Hollywood star who treasured being an independent man liberated from the confines of the entertainment industry. He showed great moral courage throughout his career, swimming against the tide of his time regardless of what Hollywood rumormongers directed at him.  I constructed this novel based on a true story from the particulars in my diary. In addition, Eric kept a detailed memoir that I possess, which he maintained from a young age until the day of his death in Peru.<br/><br/>This book is not about the failings of film executives, or their greed or shortcomings.

Total facial reconstruction due to an accident in the Navy during World War II,<br/>3.

The world has changed greatly since Eric's death, and yet his inspiring courage against all odds is as powerful and meaningful today as it was in 1966.

Can a cannabis high help to remember long gone events, to fuel your imagination, to work creatively, to come to introspective and other insights, and to empathically understand others? How much did cannabis inspire outstanding thinkers, artists and musicians like Charles Baudelaire, Rudyard Kipling, Walter Benjamin, Billie Holiday, Diego Rivera, John Lennon, Carl Sagan, Hal Ashby, and so many others? And how much did the marijuana high positively transfom our society? <br/><p><br/></p>
<p>Hello Indiegogos. <br/></p>
<p>My name is Sebastian Marincolo. I am a freelance writer and photographer with a doctorate in the philosophy of mind and have researched the positive potential of the marijuana high for more than ten years. I have almost completed writing a manuscript of my third book, ""What Hashish Did To Walter Benjamin - Mind-Altering Essays on Cannabis"" (in English),  a collection of 20 neurophilosophically inspired essays on the astounding positive potential of the cannabis high. My essays are written for a wide audience and first appeared in five languages and in shorter versions on my expert blog for the Dutch marijuana seed bank Sensi Seeds  (2013-15). I discuss why a high can be used to enhance various cognitive processes and abilities, such as to better retrieve distant memories, to focus one's attention, to better recognize patterns, to intensify sensations of all kinds, to enhance imagination, introspection, as well as to enhance empathic understanding, our ability to come up with spontaneous insights, and to personally grow.</p>
<p> On the basis of my research, I have also investigated how the marijuana high has positively affected famous thinkers, artists, musicians, and others to come to a better understanding how marijuana has inspired them – and through their work, our society as a whole. Briefly, I am aiming to show that the marijuana high offers a whole spectrum of enhancements which have been used by myriads of people with a deep positivce impact on our society. I am hoping that my book helps marijuana users, scientists as well as medical professionals from various areas to better understand the positive potential of the marijuana high. This understanding could help millions of users to avoid abuse and risks and to positively use marijuana in a more meaningful way -  for medical, inspirational, as well as recreational purposes. <br/></p>
<p>My new book has important implications for some medical uses of marijuana, such as the role of cannabis for autistic children and, also, possible roles of cannabis in psychotherapy, personal development, and healing. I am also hoping that my book can help to change our society's perspective on the role of marijuana (and other psychoactive substances like LSD and ayahuasca) in the history of mankind. I am deeply convinced that we need to legalize and regulate marijuana. Only a sane, informed, and liberal approach towards the potential of mind-altering substances will help us to end the mislabelled ""war on drugs"" - which really is a highly irrational military repression of a subgroup of users of some kinds of psychoactive substances. My mind-altering essay on this mind-altering plant are written to help us all to find our way back to a world worth living in.</p>

I thought I was completely alone in this world and that no one could understand what it was like to be me. To use a razor blade, just to be able to survive - I don't want any kid to feel like that. It's so important that we show the youth of today that you don't have to feel this way and that they're not alone. 
    Risks The biggest risk is that either finishing the book, the printing or something like that will procrastinate the release. If that would happen I'm going to inform you about it just as soon as I can.
    Other Ways You Can Help  If you're not able to contribute with money, please share this campaign to everyone you know. On Twitter, on Facebook or among your friends. Indiegogo have share tools, please use them and help me to make this project happen!

<p>The 2015 Throw Slam Team is made of
five  poets. The best five poets. (From this year's competition season.) That's right, competitive poetry. We're headed to
Saskatoon to represent Montreal at the Canadian Festival of Spoken
Word (CFSW) where we'll be competing against spoken word artists from
across Canada in the national poetry slam championships. 
</p>
<p>Throw is currently the only team from
Quebec going to nationals. Last year we made it all the way to the
finals stage, so we're pumped up to be going back. Now we just need
to get there.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Wait, what's a poetry slam?!</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>Spoken word poetry is all the feelings of normal poetry with 10
times more energy, +100 entertainment value, and a whole lot of
important stuff to talk about. A slam is a competition where
performers go head to head to see who has the best ideas, writing, and
delivery. There's a lot of laughing, crying, yelling, and eerily
silent dramatic pausing.</p>
<h3>Why do we need your help?<br/>
</h3>
<p>We're going to need to take flight more than just metaphorically
to get ourselves all the way to Saskatoon. Unfortunately Air Canada
does not accept sick rhymes as a valid currency. Donations will go

<p>Once an analyst has completed a timeline of stages (and supporting links), the website produces a <i>gamified </i>map, which lets <i>readers slide from stage to stage between past and future</i>.

<p>Readers can ask for a map of a company or nation or for a map update. Analysts can post their maps without readers asking for it. They may offer their maps either for free or for a small fee.

I am what one might call a process philosopher. I hold a BSc in Applied Physics and a PhD in Sociology. My mind's eye is on the evolving needs of society. I study our world at the crossroads where the natural and social sciences meet. In The Next Scientific Revolution​, I argue that 'reality' emerges as webs of ‘recurring patterns of behavior’ that shape our society following predictable stages. This insight produced novel opportunities. This one is about creating a website that offers freelance analysts (journalists, consultants, etc.) an automated process to map the future of companies and nations and gauge their progress. As digital marketplace of such maps, this website helps improve our chances by fostering public awareness about society's developmental needs and hiccups.
The ability to anticipate and engage the future is what I once coined Future diligence. Future diligence is precisely what this website helps stakeholders across society achieve. Companies, investment firms, hedge funds, private equity concerns, recruitment firms, political parties, electorates and, last but not least, the public at large will all benefit from this website.* Check research history here or this story in pictures here.WHAT THE WEBSITE DOES

<div>This book is primarily for the: </div>
<div><ol>
<li>""Nones"" (people who have never identified with religion), </li>
<li>""Dones"" (people who have walked away from it), and </li>
<li>""Prodigal Sons"" (people who are hanging in there or have come back to Church but don't feel like they really fit)<br/>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div>I'm in that group. Maybe you are too. If you're like me, you still think about God, What this Jesus person was about, and about big questions like why we're here, if we have purpose, and if there's something more to this universe than what we see. </div>
<div>But because of personal experiences, media portrayals or all of the scandals involving Christianity, you just don't see yourself as ""That kind of Christian."" So you figure there's no room for you at all. No place to ask questions, go deeper, connect with something bigger than yourself.</div>
<p>People asked to
complete the phrases, “God is ________” and “Jesus is
_________,” most commonly offered words like “all-loving,”
“compassionate” and “forgiving.” The same group, when asked
to complete the phrase, “Christians are ________,” offered words
like “judgmental,” “angry,” and “hypocrites.”</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So if we Christians are
supposed to reflect God and Jesus to the world, why are so many of
us such jerks? And why do we come off as so...well, weird?</p>
<p>Sometimes we Christians take everything so seriously it's a real drag. So this book is done very much with tongue in cheek, but also with the intent of getting at some real truth. And sometimes the best way to move forward, change and grow is to be able to laugh at ourselves.</p>
<p><b>What's With the Subtitle?</b></p>
<p>Some people wonder why we have ""profanity"" in the subtitle. It's not for shock value or to seem overly edgy. It's because, over and over again, when I talk to people who don't identify as Christian what it is about Christians that bothers them, more often than not it's because we can be real a-holes. So let's name it, call it out, and really, honestly talk with each other for once?</p>
<p><b>Where did the Idea Come From?</b></p>
<p>One of the most inspiring, honest sermons was from my friend who started out by saying, ""I'm a Christian because I'm an asshole."" At that moment, a little light went on inside me. It's not that I need Jesus because of original sin or to save me from burning in hell. He's not a stamp on my celestial passport. </p>
<p>But I can be a real schmuck. And once I have the humility to admit it, I might actually have something to learn from it. One of the biggest paradoxes, though, is when people mistakenly think that becoming a Christian makes them no longer be an a-hole; in fact, Christians who think they're somehow ""fixed"" are some of the biggest a-holes of all. Christianity (the religion) isn't a-hole insurance; in fact, sometimes it just makes us worse to be around.</p>
<p>So I'm an occasional jerk and know I could use some help with it. But if I never completely get over being an jerk, what's the point of trying? What good is this Jesus guy? If I'm going to be an a-hole, why not go big and have fun doing it?</p>
<p>Because we're all connected. We need each other, whether we like it or not. We're in this life together, and we owe it to each other, as Bill and Ted famously said, to ""be excellent to each other.""</p>

<p>You can also spread the word by sharing the campaign with your fiends and anyone else via social media or the like who would be interested in checking it out.

<h3>Stories of Science and Us</h3>
<p>When thirteen-year-old Parin's parents signed her up for a ""science communication"" event, she wondered, ""Why would I go to an event that's probably about writing lab reports?"" After all, she spends most of her time in theater classes, not studying science.</p>
<p>An hour into the event, though, Parin found herself excitedly jotting down notes instead of doodling Sailor Moon-inspired characters (as she was prone to do during biology class). What changed? When a workshop leader demonstrated using Twitter to share science, Parin realized that there were more ways to interact with science than she'd thought.</p>
<p><a href=""https://scienceandus.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Science and Us</a> is a youth-led nonprofit teaching teens how to communicate—and by extension, <i>understand</i>—STEM. Science and Us opened up a new world for Parin, one where Sailor Moon and photosynthesis could coexist. Now, as the youngest member of our team, she's helping make that change in others' lives too.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556757463/qo95qklrlfukzzrq6tgn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Part of the Science and Us team with Gabi Serrato Marks (right) of Communicating Science at MIT and Mackenzie Lemieux, an event volunteer</i></p>
<p>But Parin is <strong>lucky</strong>. There are thousands of programs getting young people into STEM, but virtually none focused on communicating it, or highlighting ways to appreciate science without being a scientist. Careers in science media, policy, and outreach—which are important to society <i>and</i> fulfill students' wide-ranging interests—are almost never mentioned in school. We're helping our peers realize that they can find and invent jobs where they can be fully themselves.</p>
<p>We're interviewing dozens of diverse people who bridge STEM and the public, then compiling their stories and advice into a book. We'll share this book and free excerpts with classrooms across the country, because finding a place for STEM in your life shouldn't depend on luck.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're using <a href=""https://www.48hrbooks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">48 Hour Books</a> to print the books. It'll cost about $1000 to order 200 copies, based on our current page number estimates.</li>
<li>(If we don't reach our goal, we'll print as many copies as our funding allows for.)</li>
<li>Additional funding we receive will go toward printing more books and supporting our Makeathon events, where we help Boston-area middle and high schoolers create articles, podcasts, and art explaining STEM topics!</li>
<li><strong>We have lots of perks, including digital and physical copies of the book, a chance to have science communicators call into your classroom to answer your students' questions, stickers and posters, and access to our invite-only launch event in Boston this fall!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When we get <i>Stories of Science and Us</i> in classrooms and libraries across the country, we're enabling thousands of students—who are often expected to make decisions about their future—to discover careers bridging STEM and the public. This can be life-changing.</p>
<p>When students engross themselves in the vivid, tangible journeys of diverse science communicators, they realize that they can pursue fields like science media, policy, education, and outreach, or create their own path.</p>
<p>When we teach young people to communicate science, we teach them to understand science and approach challenges in any field. We prepare them to solve the world's problems, which transcend disciplines, in a way that memorizing facts never will.</p>

</div></div>","Stories of Science and Us
When thirteen-year-old Parin's parents signed her up for a ""science communication"" event, she wondered, ""Why would I go to an event that's probably about writing lab reports?"" After all, she spends most of her time in theater classes, not studying science.
An hour into the event, though, Parin found herself excitedly jotting down notes instead of doodling Sailor Moon-inspired characters (as she was prone to do during biology class). What changed? When a workshop leader demonstrated using Twitter to share science, Parin realized that there were more ways to interact with science than she'd thought.
Science and Us is a youth-led nonprofit teaching teens how to communicate—and by extension, understand—STEM. Science and Us opened up a new world for Parin, one where Sailor Moon and photosynthesis could coexist. Now, as the youngest member of our team, she's helping make that change in others' lives too.

Part of the Science and Us team with Gabi Serrato Marks (right) of Communicating Science at MIT and Mackenzie Lemieux, an event volunteer
But Parin is lucky. There are thousands of programs getting young people into STEM, but virtually none focused on communicating it, or highlighting ways to appreciate science without being a scientist. Careers in science media, policy, and outreach—which are important to society and fulfill students' wide-ranging interests—are almost never mentioned in school. We're helping our peers realize that they can find and invent jobs where they can be fully themselves.
We're interviewing dozens of diverse people who bridge STEM and the public, then compiling their stories and advice into a book. We'll share this book and free excerpts with classrooms across the country, because finding a place for STEM in your life shouldn't depend on luck.
 

What We Need & What You Get

We're using 48 Hour Books to print the books. It'll cost about $1000 to order 200 copies, based on our current page number estimates.
(If we don't reach our goal, we'll print as many copies as our funding allows for.)
Additional funding we receive will go toward printing more books and supporting our Makeathon events, where we help Boston-area middle and high schoolers create articles, podcasts, and art explaining STEM topics!
We have lots of perks, including digital and physical copies of the book, a chance to have science communicators call into your classroom to answer your students' questions, stickers and posters, and access to our invite-only launch event in Boston this fall!

 

The Impact
When we get Stories of Science and Us in classrooms and libraries across the country, we're enabling thousands of students—who are often expected to make decisions about their future—to discover careers bridging STEM and the public. This can be life-changing.
When students engross themselves in the vivid, tangible journeys of diverse science communicators, they realize that they can pursue fields like science media, policy, education, and outreach, or create their own path.
When we teach young people to communicate science, we teach them to understand science and approach challenges in any field. We prepare them to solve the world's problems, which transcend disciplines, in a way that memorizing facts never will.

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>Pete Thompson grew up in the freedom of the pristine beaches of southern California in the 50's.  Hermosa Beach was his home, but Manhattan Beach, Redondo and Torrance beaches were his backyard playground as well.  His brothers and sister were enveloped by the new and growing surf culture that would engage the world in the coming years. The surf legends of this new  phenomenon were his brothers first time employers, and best friends.  His strict parents looked always for the best address, as his family moved to the ""Hill"" of the wealth and privilege of Palos Verdes Estates.  Majestic cliffs overlooked the Pacific where inside a gated beach community he surfed most any day, and became his enclave and sanctuary during his high school years and onto young adulthood.</p>
<p>His life of ease took a real turn after college graduation.  Getting a job, the Draft, and Vietnam confronted his new life.  <i>I was on my own.</i>  So, I volunteered for the Marine Corps, Summer 1969.  It is here I met two men, Jesse and Hector from the hood of south central and the barrio of East LA and through the crucible of Marine training, we became brothers and learned <strong>that skin color didn't mean a damn thing</strong>.  I've retired after a successful career in sales and marketing management and have been blessed with a strong marriage of 44 years and three good kids and six grand children.   <strong>The Bend</strong> is my first novel and its message of brotherhood that was challenged to the breaking point, is one I have wanted to tell for many years.  Three families of different race and background have the same fears and aspirations of all of us, as they navigate through the Freedom of the 50's ( for some ) into the upheaval of the cultural turmoil of the 60's.  Although each live just a few miles from apart, they in fact live on different planets culturally, but are more similar than different.  This is a central theme of <strong>The Bend</strong>. </p>
<p><i>The heartache of lost love, redemption, hard choices and the tragic murder of a father, the pull of the gangs, and the Vietnam War's impact, are historic themes and events that impact these men and their families, which punctuate this important and historic telling of great change in America.</i></p>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p><strong>First, why a crowd funding campaign.  </strong>The first publication took over 8 years to write and publish via an independent print on demand publisher. I chose to self edit this work, and that was a big mistake.  I have spent several thousand dollars personally in this effort. Now, understanding the real costs and expense of this undertaking and as I remain passionate about the story and its important message, I need assistance in getting this work re-launched and edited properly, so the book  and story can be offered to the world as the first rate product it deserves to be.</p>
<p>When you contribute to this project for the re-launch of the book you will provide invaluable support for the telling of this historical and timely story.  The three main characters, Pet, Jesse, and Hector will show how their lives in the hood of south central and the barrio of East LA are far more similar than different to the privilege Pete experienced in Hermosa Beach and the upper class enclave of Palos Verdes Estates.  </p>
<p>It is my hope <strong>The Bend</strong> will inspire many more to realize the bond of brotherhood and family is universal, for those who are willing.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Our Goal is to raise $25,000.</strong></p>
<p>These funds will be to cover the costs of putting the manuscript into the hands of an experienced Print On Demand publisher with the expertise to do the professional and complete job of proof and copy edit, as well as for content and word craft.  Their staff will provide the finest quality for hard, soft bound books as well as ebooks and audio book production.  Costs to cover promotion expenses, which include travel for book signing events, Perks allotment for signed editions, shirts, hats, coffee mugs, etc., as well as trade mark and purchase of certain images in the book are to be paid for.</p>
<p>Your contributions will be set aside in an account overseen by Indiegogo, and will not be allocated to a separate account I will be able use no earlier than 15 days after the campaign is completed.  The new edition is slated to be available by May 2020.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenge for me is to have many of you believe as I have that the story and message of<strong> The Bend</strong> is one that resonates and is one you desire to see shown to our divided country, if not the world.  This is a Huge undertaking for me personally.  As the book has been published once, and not produced in the quality way it should have, then why support this ongoing effort?  Well, for me, the message that skin color doesn't mean a damn thing and the tableau of the story of three families who live so close physically and of different race, but with the same hopes and dreams is a message which must be told  over and over.  The inherit message of <strong>The Bend</strong> is universal and one we must come to embrace if we as a culture and world are to finally reach our true potential. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you may not be able to contribute much to this campaign.  Although, the smallest donation of $5 or $10 will add up and be very helpful.  But, if you can not contribute financially, I am asking for you to tell your friends and others about this book and about its timely message.  If successful in achieving my goal, any and all will be acknowledged for helping, whether you gave a dollar, or just passed along the good word of <strong>The Bend.</strong></p>

<h3>Greetings. I am mOody bLaCk National Award Winning Poet and Host, Smart Arts Teaching Artist, Comedian, Voice Over Actor, and Beard Enthusiast.</h3>
<p>I am raising funds to perform on tour in California. This tour is important to me because I've traveled and performed a great bit of the US. However, I've never been to California to share my gift. I've been requested throughout the years but never had the means to get to California. I would love to be able to perform and facilitate writing workshops for people of all ages in California. This would serve as a means for people (who I haven't had a chance to reach) to learn how to express themselves and heal. That would mean the world to me!  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>HERE'S WHERE YOU COME IN:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I need investors to fund the trip from South Carolina to California</li>
<li>The cost is $2000 (plane ticket from SC to northern CA, from northern CA to southern CA, from southern CA back to SC/ lodging and food for 2 weeks)</li>
<li>If an investor pay $100- I will serve as a brand ambassador for your brand for a month, $200- I will serve as a brand ambassador for your brand for 2 months, and so on... And what that means is I will wear paraphernalia, shout out your brand, market and promote and my social platforms 2 days a week for a month or more...depending on the investment you make.</li>
<li>If the goal is not met: I will use the funds to perform on a tour closer to my geographical location. Making sure I serve a community in need for arts integration and/or healing through poetry.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Attending poetry events and workshops have such a positive impact in a community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poetry has been known to improve mental health and writing skills. I have been diagnosed with depression since 1996 and I found it quite therapeutic.  Therefore, I feel it's imperative to share my story through poem to help others do the same.</li>
<li>Every city I perform or facilitate a workshop: people have approached me to let me know how I've given them hope and a new perspective on life. That I made it feasible for them to be open about what they feel and to share with others in hopes to heal.</li>

<h3>The background</h3>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 virus we are forced to move our Beyond Storytelling Conference in Berlin from May 2020 to May 2021. To keep the bond, to stimulate further conversation, and – last but not least – to compensate our losses we want to print the conference READER like nothing had happened and release it in May 2020.</p>
<p>The conference READER is an inspiring collection of features, essays, interviews, reflections and stories. With contributions from Mary Alice Arthur, Stephanie Bachmair, Jacques Chlopczyk, Julie Diamond, David Epston, Christine Erlach, Eric Flügge, Roi Gal-Or, Bettina Haasen, Sohail Inayatullah, Ulrich Jungblut, Jeffer London, Michael Margolis, Michael Müller, Adah Parris, Wolfgang Tonninger, Michael White and Meike Ziegler.<br/> </p>
<h3>The financial frame</h3>
<ul>
<li>To be able to print the READER we have to raise at least 1.500 EURO with this campaign.</li>
<li>Our target lies on 5.000 EURO to cover part of our expenses for the conference 2020 due to #COVID-19.</li>
<li>To make it easy for you to decide we created some unique and reasonable perks.</li>
<li>In the case, we cannot make the first hurdle of 1.500 EURO, we will pay back all the money.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>The book</h3>
<ul><li>Why we want to print the READER and not just spread it as pdf?<ul>
<li>Because we love the format and we think that it is a treasure box for the pillow.</li>
<li>Because it is physically serving as a bond for the community, to remind each one of us what inspiring source this can be.<br/> </li>
</ul>

<p>The show will go on ...</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","The background
Due to the COVID-19 virus we are forced to move our Beyond Storytelling Conference in Berlin from May 2020 to May 2021. To keep the bond, to stimulate further conversation, and – last but not least – to compensate our losses we want to print the conference READER like nothing had happened and release it in May 2020.
The conference READER is an inspiring collection of features, essays, interviews, reflections and stories. With contributions from Mary Alice Arthur, Stephanie Bachmair, Jacques Chlopczyk, Julie Diamond, David Epston, Christine Erlach, Eric Flügge, Roi Gal-Or, Bettina Haasen, Sohail Inayatullah, Ulrich Jungblut, Jeffer London, Michael Margolis, Michael Müller, Adah Parris, Wolfgang Tonninger, Michael White and Meike Ziegler. 
The financial frame

To be able to print the READER we have to raise at least 1.500 EURO with this campaign.
Our target lies on 5.000 EURO to cover part of our expenses for the conference 2020 due to #COVID-19.
To make it easy for you to decide we created some unique and reasonable perks.
In the case, we cannot make the first hurdle of 1.500 EURO, we will pay back all the money. 

The book
Why we want to print the READER and not just spread it as pdf?
Because we love the format and we think that it is a treasure box for the pillow.
Because it is physically serving as a bond for the community, to remind each one of us what inspiring source this can be.

<p>I am starting a new, but different kind of adventure in my life. I am experimenting with...AUTHORSHIP! I'm introducing my first self-published book...</p>
<p><strong>A DAY IN THE WOODS OF NANA'S BACKYARD!</strong></p>
<p>But, I need your help to get the books out to YOU!  So, I am raising funds to get books printed and out to the public. The manuscript, illustrations, and layout are complete and in queue to print at a book publishing company! <i>Ready...set... </i></p>
<p>This book project is special to me because it evokes nostalgic memories of childhood vacations.  Personally, I feel my eyes welling up and a warm fuzzy feeling 'round my heart each time I read it and get to the ending! I think it will move you, too! It also evokes the memory of playing outside and childhood curiosity.  I hope to inspire a new generation of children that are not often playing outside, to...play outside! At least when it is possible.  This story is also a reminder that communing with nature has GREAT health benefits for ""kids"" of ALL ages! </p>
<p>It's a great story for young AND old!  The story is about, a young city girl that explores and discovers the secrets of the woods in a small country town when visiting her family.  Will the adventure stop there?  Read it and find out!</p>
<p>An online book club advance review describes the adventure as...magical!</p>
<p>So...It's <i>GO</i> time! Will you help?</p>

<p>I want to get this project done in a month...2 weeks for pledging and 2 weeks for printing.  And, I want to get rewards out to all pledgers by September if not sooner!  Wish me luck, and... <br/>#TakeTime2Read</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Cristina Petersen is West Coast born and raised and has always had a passion for reading and writing, From an early age, she wrote elaborate stories and had a strong desire to work with people in a creative way. From her many travels, she found her path as an English language instructor and has a B.A. and M.A. in Applied Linguistics from the University of Victoria. She also loves painting and art in general and views her teaching practice as one of the many ways she can express her creativity.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Monika Blichar is a Polish-Canadian artist and entrepreneur with a passion for all things creative. She is the owner of Monika's Art Boutique, Art World Expo, and Painting Dreams International Art Tours. Monika has been teaching since 2007 and has a BA in English and French from the University of Victoria. Monika has been inspired by all things creative from an early age and is committed to sharing this passion with others via creative projects, community events and artist retreats in British Columbia and Europe. </span></p>
<p>Bringing Murray to life in this book is important to us for several reasons. Murray is a reflection of many people and how they feel about themselves. Murray has no fire and as a result, he feels inadequate in comparison to his fellow dragons. This story helps teach children about acceptance, courage and love for all living things-all important values to instill into children at early ages. In addition, we also believe strongly in education and learning through creativity and imagination. The story takes the reader into a world filled with magic and wonder and our resources at the back can help children with vocabulary, reading comprehension and art activities. The book would be a great addition to any home or classroom and we would love to see Murray fly with kids all over the world! </p>
<p>If you contributed to our campaign, you would be helping us teach children all over the world through a unique and magical story. Murray could fly around the world and into the hearts of many children, families and schools with your help!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $3,500 to get started. </p>
<p>$2,600 will be needed to raise funds to pay our Publisher.</p>
<p>$500 is needed for art supplies to create story boards first via canvas then in printed form with high resolution images.</p>
<p>$400 is needed to pay for travel expenses to meet and finalize all details with the publisher in Victoria.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book would make a difference in the lives of both children, families and other educators around the world. Bringing magic and imagination through Murray's experience would allow all readers to learn and internalize the moral of the story and apply it in their lives. Too often in today's society, we are taught to conform and look or act in a certain way. Murray's feeling like he doesn't belong is only too real for many kids (and adults!). By going through this life experience, he comes to realize with the help of his dragon friends that true happiness and belonging are within us all, despite differences in abilities or appearances. He also realizes that the Earth is the most precious thing to life and that he must protect it. Murray is magical and from that place of wonder, we hope this story will inspire children and adults alike! </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are both working more than full time each week on our careers in education and art. While we have no shortage of ideas and creativity, our challenges come from a lack of  time and funds available to invest in our passion projects while contributing to our households, maintaining a studio and gallery and balancing work with life. If we are funded to our goal, we will be able to efficiently publish the book while guaranteeing that the challenge of time and investment funds are not in our way. We have been dedicated to education and invested many years into Bachelor's and Master's degrees  and are committed to making this book possible! </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute by pre-ordering a package outlined in the description, please send this campaign to your network via email or other social media, for example, a favourite teacher past or present, other parents, friends and family. We would love to help other educators and families have this book in 2018!</p>

<h3>A Little about <i>Drunk Monkeys</i>
</h3>
<p>Founded in 2011 in the heart of the San Fernando Valley, <i>Drunk Monkeys </i>became a place to feature great works of literature and pop culture criticism. We've showcased everything from <a href=""http://www.drunkmonkeys.us/drunk-monkeys-vol-2-no-11-the-year-of-trump/?rq=trump"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">political musings </a>to <a href=""http://www.drunkmonkeys.us/drunk-monkeys-vol-2-no-9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">smut</a> to what is <a href=""http://www.drunkmonkeys.us/drunk-monkeys-issue-34-pop-culture-issue-its-not-about-the-pasta/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hands- down our biggest issue of all time</a>. We yearn to read things that build worlds and break hearts, and we are proud of <a href=""http://www.drunkmonkeys.us/mission-statement/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our stance against abuse and harassment</a>.</p>
<p>We are a staff of unpaid volunteers, and this is a labor of love. And, unfortunately, we are not a paying market, but we'd love that to change. <br/> </p>
<p>And for the first year, we'd love to humbly ask you for help.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've done the math, and in order to compensate our contributors from January to December of 2019, we will need to raise <i><strong>at least </strong></i>$2500. </p>
<p>Here's how that will work: </p>
<p><strong>Fiction, poetry, art, and essays</strong> will be paid $10 a piece.</p>
<p><strong>Writers of the Month </strong>will be paid a $15 flat fee.</p>
<p>The budget for each month is around $200 ($2400 for the year with an additional $100 of wiggle room).</p>
<p><strong>Editorial staff will not be paid using this money </strong>(editorial staff is unpaid, anyway).</p>
<p>These amounts are subject to change, depending on volume of work and how much is raised (we want to be able to pay people as much as possible), with any extra amount going towards the 2020 budget. Donors will be notified of how funds are distributed for transparency's sake.</p>
<p>What do you get for becoming a donor? Well, what don't you get? We have a wide variety of perks, from pins to editorial services to <i>Vanderpump Rules</i> livestreams to an exclusive <a href=""http://www.drunkmonkeys.us/2017-posts/?tag=Mr.+Butterchips"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Mr. Butterchips </i>print made by our very own Alex Schumacher</a>! There's something for everyone at every donation level.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we will use any funds to compensate our contributors appropriately in reflection of what we do raise; our donors will be notified in an update towards/ at the end of the campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As writers ourselves, we all know that it's often a thankless job. Too often it's pay-to-play, with reading fees that seem to pile up quickly and little to no payout. We definitely understand the frustration of not being compensated for work, and the excitement of money coming in from something you wrote, something that was loved and appreciated. While we won't be able to pay the dream-bucks we wish we could, we believe that a modest payment is a welcome addition to the joy of publication; we want our authors and artists to know we appreciate them and their work. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge we face is not meeting our goal, and having to adjust our payment plan. We are raising this money to pay our contributors, not our staff, and not the various fees that go along with running a literary journal. It is essential we reach at least $2500 in order to be able to compensate our writers and authors accordingly. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know how tight money can be; we're all feeling it personally, too. And we never want you to feel you have to make a monetary contribution if you can't afford it. But there are other ways you can help! Sharing the link with your social circles can make a big impact in our campaign, so feel free to throw that link on your Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or whatever the cool kids are using these days!</p>
<p>And really, the greatest thing you can do is check us out. If you like what you're reading, comment on our posts, let the writers and artists know! We love community interaction. We love all of you. We want you to be part of the Drunk Monkeys family. </p>

Founded in 2011 in the heart of the San Fernando Valley, Drunk Monkeys became a place to feature great works of literature and pop culture criticism.

My partner-in-crime is Phil Giunta, up-and-coming author of the scariest stories you'll ever read. We are FIREBRINGER PRESS, and, for fifteen years, we've been bringing the works of unpublished and under-published authors to the reading public. </p>
<p>It is our honor and privilege to offer <i>Meanwhile in the Middle of Eternity</i>, our third anthology showcasing the work of 13 astounding authors and six incredible artists. And, to do right by them, we need your help!</p>
<p>We’re delivering a fantastic and diverse array of stories. Join gods and mortals in combat against slithering demons in famine-stricken Finland. Witness an unconventional battle of wits as a devious genie tries to outfox a clever robot.</p>
<p>Ride with two hapless deliverymen as they stumble upon a frightening ritual to propitiate an ancient and malevolent power. Escape to a remote corner of the globe with a desperate family fleeing an insidious alien invasion. Follow a fraternity pledge as he undergoes an initiation to terror at a local cemetery.</p>
<p>The $4000 we're seeking will pay the basic setup costs for getting the book into distribution; it will cover marketing costs; but, most of all, it will allow us to compensate our authors and artists at semi-professional rates. It's important to us that hard work pay off. Well, these folks have done the work. You can help us reward them for it. </p>
</div><div>
<p>In return, we can provide you with autographed copies of this incredible book, or an ebook version, if you're on a tight budget. If you can contribute a little more, we can provide ebook or paper copies of the earlier two titles in this series. And, if you're a writer yourself and looking for feedback from experienced professionals, Phil and I have a reward level which allows you to submit a work for formal critique. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal? Que sera sera. We're doing this. Contributors will still get their perks, and we'll starve for our art. Okay, we'll do simulated fasting for our art. Our fifteen-year track record proves that we deliver quality books despite the challenges involved in indie publishing. </p>
<p>But we'll make our goal, because we know our community values good storytelling, dynamic artwork, and the talented people who craft them. You've proved that many times in the past through our successful campaigns for our Firebringer Take Two project, my novel <i>Sacrifice Play - A Tale from the Arbiter Chronicles</i>, and the previous volume in the ""Eternity"" series, <i>Elsewhere in the Middle of Eternity.</i> </p>
<p>So please join us in supporting <i>Meanwhile in the Middle of Eternity</i> and the team that put it together for you. Even if you can't spare any money in the midst of our topsy turvy times, please support us by sharing the link to this campaign with your friends and social media followers. </p>

<h3>Welcome to the crowdfund for <i>Conversations on AI</i> - a 200 page trade paperback and free eBook featuring dialogues between pioneering thinkers and responses to these from the book's first readers.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>What's the book about?</h2>
<p>Click on the video above ☝️☝️☝️ and allow our AI presenters to enlighten you.</p>
<p>The initial impetus for the project was to assemble a group of writers, artists and thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in, and publish their discussions as a ~200 page free eBook and trade paperback.</p>
<p>That group ended up comprising <strong>Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester</strong> and <strong>Nick Srnicek</strong>. And the topic that turned out to unite their interests was Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>These thinkers have previously dealt with AI from various angles: some have written about AI directly (Reza Negarestani's <i>Intelligence and Spirit</i> and Nick Srnicek's work on the political economy of AI), some engage with AI as a collaborator (Holly Herndon, Mat Dryhurst and SPAWN), while some have developed the notion of artificiality in itself as a means out of conceptual deadlock (Helen Hester and Benjamin Bratton).</p>
<p>In the three conversations on the topic, AI will act more as a crossroads than the sole focus. Our dialogists are fascinated by the impact that AI will have on politics, art, philosophy, education, terraforming, and many more things, meaning that although the dialogues may consistently pass through AI, they will almost certainly end up at surprising destinations.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>Reza Negarestani </strong>is a philosopher and a former systems engineer. He originally became known for pioneering his pioneering work of theory-fiction <i>Cyclonopedia</i> (2008). Since the early 2000s, he has contributed extensively to journals and anthologies, and lectured at numerous international universities and institutes including Duke University, MIT, École Normale Supérieure, and Haus der Kulturen der Welt among others. Negarestani’s writings have been translated into twelve languages. Negarestani’s latest philosophical work is <i>Intelligence and Spirit </i>(Urbanomic/Sequence Press/MIT, 2018), a book investigating the meaning of intelligence at the intersection of artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, theory of computation and the philosophy of German Idealism.</p>

<p><strong>Benjamin Bratton's</strong> work spans Philosophy, Art, Design and Computer Science. He is Professor of Visual Arts at the University of California, San Diego. He is Program Director of The Terraforming programme at Strelka Institute of Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow. He is also a Visiting Professor at The European Graduate School, SCI_Arc (The Southern California Institute of Architecture) and NYU Shanghai. He is the author of several books including <i>The Revenge of The Real: Politics for a Post-Pandemic World</i> (Verso, 2021) and <i>The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty</i> (MIT Press, 2015).</p>

<p><strong>Holly Herndon </strong>operates at the edge of electronic and avant-garde pop music and emerges with a dynamic and disruptive canon of her own. On her most recent full-length album PROTO Herndon fronts and conducts an electronic pop choir comprised of both human and AI voices over a musical palette that encompasses everything from synths to Sacred Harp stylings. CNN noted that Herndon is 'shaping the future of AI' and she has demonstrated this nexus of technological evolution and musical catharsis with elevated performances at The Barbican (London), Volksbühne (Berlin), Sónar (Barcelona), Unsound (Krakow), and Club 2 Club (Milan). The sounds synthesized on PROTO by Herndon, her AI “baby” Spawn, and the vocal ensemble combine elements from Herndon’s dynamic and idiosyncratic personal journey: the timeless folk traditions of her childhood experiences in church-going East Tennessee (particularly the prismatic layered practice of Sacred Harp singing), the avant-garde music she explored while at Mills College, and the radical club culture of Berlin, all enhanced by her recent PhD composition studies at Stanford University, researching machine learning and music. Herndon co-founded the podcast series Interdependence alongside Mat Dryhurst.</p>
<p><strong>Mat Dryhurst</strong> releases music, research and artworks solo and in conjunction with creative partner Holly Herndon. He teaches at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Music, Strelka Institute and the European Graduate School and hosts discussions with figures shaping 21st century culture on the Interdependence podcast.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1</strong></p>

<p>This is where things really start to get interesting.</p>
<p>Before the trade paperback is published, Impossible Object will seek responses to the dialogues from their first readership. The call for proposed responses will be open to all readers.

Films by Metahaven include <i>The Sprawl</i> (Propaganda about Propaganda) (2015), <i>Information Skies</i> (2016, nominated for the 2017 European Film Awards), <i>Hometown</i> (2018), <i>Eurasia (Questions on Happiness)</i> (2018), and <i>Chaos</i> <i>Theory</i> (2021). Solo exhibitions include Turnarounds, e-flux, New York (2019), Version History, ICA London (2018), Earth, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (2018), Hometown, Izolyatsia, Kyiv (2018), Information Skies, Auto Italia, London (2016), The Sprawl, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2015), and Islands in the Cloud, MoMA PS1, New York (2013). Recent publications include <i>PSYOP: An Anthology</i> (Koenig Books, London, 2018), and <i>Digital</i> <i>Tarkovsky</i> (Strelka Press, Moscow, 2018).</p>
<p>Not only will Metahaven be doing editorial design for Conversations on AI; in line with a plan that will be repeated with future Impossible Object titles, the front cover image will be minted as a standalone NFT and auctioned a little further down the line.</p>

This process took many years writing, emailing, and editing our works between two continents. The summer of 2020, we completed our first novel and soon after had a second novel completed. Every time I read through our books, I crack a smile or LMAO at some of the absurd, nonsensical, tales that came out of our heads.

We are extremely excited and proud of our work and cannot wait for people to start reading our comedic look at what it takes to tour North America with a rock band!The money we are raising will be used to offset the costs that are out of pocket  marketing expenses to increase our reach. Our out of pocket expenses to this point have been: book editing, formatting, book cover design, copyright expenses, and the actual cost of publishing to different platforms and the printing of promo books. We have an extensive marketing campaign planned that will extend into our knowledge of the music touring industry along with multiple online social media campaigns and various music platforms. Our book will appeal to music fans and mystery readers and fans of authors such as Tim Dorsey, Carl Hiaasen, Randy Wayne White, Christopher Moore and many others. We tried to keep the perks fun and with the theme of the book.  Hope you like it, we had fun writing and coming up with the concept. World’s greatest guitarist The Doctor, Jurgen Weislangwolf's latest tour was locked down and ready to kick off like any other tour. But an ex-stage manager had other plans, waiting for his chance to get back out on the road. Without any fanfare, the tour started with an unnoticed set of eyes watching every detail. Hardened tour professionals Jeb and Neusy can easily navigate any tour loaded with con men and rip off artists in their path. When murder and mayhem started to become an obstacle, the success of the tour became dependent on them keeping the band safe.  Content and enjoying his new life on the road,  the ex-stage manager was always watching and waiting for his opportunity to create chaos, which increased  once he realized the incompetence of the two FBI agents that were assigned to the tour. Comedy and satire on an already humorous industry where vile and disreputable people have been known to ruin many careers.  Kent Niepert - “ I have always been involved music from a young age, starting my first hard rocking band at 16 and always dreamed of being a famous guitarist. Never reaching that ultimate goal I supported my two musician sons to be the best that they could be musically. I had managed my son’s bands, War/n/t and CUJO in China. I have also played lead guitar with them on stage in large festivals.” “My dreams took on a different direction when Jeff invited me on a tour featuring famous musicians, several of whom were idols of my youth. Touring was hard work and not always “shits and giggles”, but I learned what it took to set up a stage for many players as well as getting them to their hotel rooms at night for a well-deserved rest between travels.” “After years of touring and sharing stories on life on the road, Jeff and I were inspired to write our own stories featuring fictional rock stars, fans, booking agents, and crew. This process took many years writing, emailing, and editing our works between two continents. The summer of 2020, we completed our first novel and soon after had a second novel completed. Every time I read through our books, I crack a smile or LMAO at some of the absurd, nonsensical, tales that came out of our heads. I’m sure anyone that reads this will enjoy learning about what touring is all about with a lot of zany instances that take place during the story.”  Jeff Agins:  ""When I was given the opportunity to work with a national rock tour in the nineties it certainly was a learning experience which I was able to apply a lot of what I learned into my everyday life and the business I had at the time. """"A highlight of my career was producing a five day guitar seminar on the campus of UCLA. The seminar featured three concerts with guest musicians I grew up listening to.""""After many tours and real life experiences It was extremely satisfying and entertaining to be able to take my knowledge of the music industry and create a fictional world. Working with Kent created such fun times of writing, waiting for his reaction and reading what he would write back.  I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it."" Follow us on Facebook",5.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>THE BOOK</h3>
<p>This is a book about Los Angeles' Architecture, Streets &amp; City told in stories by people at a time of significant urban change: The hills are for the first time in 60 years joined with the coast by a public railway line. Neighbourhoods will transform and the city is undergoing a cultural shift. We will document LA stories at this pivotal moment through the voice of local people and publish as a collection of written and visual essays. </p>
<p>Our only rule: <i>To tell Los Angeles’ stories using only public transport.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Packed with genuine humor and warmth it will be a book to treasure for its humanity as well as its documentary on architecture and neighbourhood development.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Don't Laugh, the Metro Expansion to Santa Monica Is an Actual Success” </i></strong><br/>Hollywood Reporter 2016 by Peter Flax</p>
<p>The full extension of the expo line only just opened in May this year, which is why the timing of this book is now. Enough of the public transport network is now up and running to make it an essential part of everyday life for a growing number of people. The young are able to build an entirely different life to the older generation, which shifts urban and architectural demands and aspirations. Is a new kind of city emerging? This and many more questions will be addressed allowing moments and the idiosyncratic to paint a clear set of characteristics, issues and latent opportunities. Finding the spectacular in the mundane and the mundane in the spectacular. Example stories might be ""Downtown Milk"" mapping milk stories downtown (drawn &amp; anecdotal - how does a city function?) &amp; ""The journey to Stalh house"" account of journey through the people met along the way. </p>

<p><b>Who is involved?</b></p>
<p>Contributions will come from renowned architects, artists, writers, cultural and civic institutions as well as the man, woman, friend of a friend encountered in a deli, street &amp; neighbourhood. We are already talking to City Hall, Morphosis, Simon Sadler, Andrew Holmes &amp; Peter Cook and so far all is very encouraging even if not yet definite. Paul Karakusuevic of Karakusuevic Carson will reflect on housing in his ""a tale of two cities""(working title). </p>
<p>Testimonial: <i>"" You've chosen a great topic, because public transport in LA is so unlikely, and its impact is a culture shock: LA will be reinvented.""</i> Simon Sadler, Professor in Architecture UCD</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will we do this?</strong></p>
<p>As architects and architecture students from the uk, we will tell the stories through drawings, photography, film, interviews and other writing in a collection of ‘urban essays’.  We will in our fieldwork prompt reactions as much as answers in our interview and engagement techniques and learn from the works of Raynar Banham “Los Angeles, The Architecture of Four Ecologies”, Mike Davies “City of Quartz”, Venturi &amp; Scott Brown “Learning from Las Vegas”, Paul Auster’s “True Tales of American Life” &amp; Archis “Mokum” &amp; “Beyroutes” (to name but a few). As outsiders we will develop an observant journalistic dialogue with Los Angeles and work together to reveal new detail about this forever fascinating city.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The book is for...</strong></p>
<p>Los Angeles and for readers around the world interested in architecture, society and city development. The stories we tell will be based on LA’s own experiences as they are told to us. The language will celebrate the diversity we encounter and the architecture will be experienced in sequence with life as it happens around it.</p>

<h3><strong>WE NEED YOU</strong></h3>
<p>All funding will go directly towards facilitating first-hand interviews, the making of the book and its publication in hardcopy and digital versions. With your support we will create an excellent book which captures this moment celebrating LA as it is now. Any additional funding will go towards hosting an exhibition of the work in London and LA and fund a travelling lecture to universities and architecture practices.</p> <p><strong>When will it be ready?</strong></p>
<p>We are aiming for a september 2017 publication, which will be the culmination of 4 years of research by Cultural Geometries lead by Christina Godiksen. Our first hand interviews and documentary of LA is planned for January 2017.  </p>

<p>“I have been going to LA for the past 3 years and seen visible change occurring year on year. As an outsider and visitor these changes appear perhaps starker and more tangible than to those who live in the change, which is why I believe that the ping pong we as a team can have in our direct engagement with the city, specific neighbourhoods and people, is critical in revealing a truly unique perspective which has not yet been documented. I will draw on my experience working with Archis on “Mokum” to direct the contributions and in my role as editor”</p>

</div></div>","THE BOOK
This is a book about Los Angeles' Architecture, Streets & City told in stories by people at a time of significant urban change: The hills are for the first time in 60 years joined with the coast by a public railway line. Neighbourhoods will transform and the city is undergoing a cultural shift. We will document LA stories at this pivotal moment through the voice of local people and publish as a collection of written and visual essays. 
Our only rule: To tell Los Angeles’ stories using only public transport.
 
 
Packed with genuine humor and warmth it will be a book to treasure for its humanity as well as its documentary on architecture and neighbourhood development.
“Don't Laugh, the Metro Expansion to Santa Monica Is an Actual Success” Hollywood Reporter 2016 by Peter Flax
The full extension of the expo line only just opened in May this year, which is why the timing of this book is now. Enough of the public transport network is now up and running to make it an essential part of everyday life for a growing number of people. The young are able to build an entirely different life to the older generation, which shifts urban and architectural demands and aspirations. Is a new kind of city emerging? This and many more questions will be addressed allowing moments and the idiosyncratic to paint a clear set of characteristics, issues and latent opportunities. Finding the spectacular in the mundane and the mundane in the spectacular. Example stories might be ""Downtown Milk"" mapping milk stories downtown (drawn & anecdotal - how does a city function?) & ""The journey to Stalh house"" account of journey through the people met along the way. 

Who is involved?
Contributions will come from renowned architects, artists, writers, cultural and civic institutions as well as the man, woman, friend of a friend encountered in a deli, street & neighbourhood. We are already talking to City Hall, Morphosis, Simon Sadler, Andrew Holmes & Peter Cook and so far all is very encouraging even if not yet definite. Paul Karakusuevic of Karakusuevic Carson will reflect on housing in his ""a tale of two cities""(working title). 
Testimonial: "" You've chosen a great topic, because public transport in LA is so unlikely, and its impact is a culture shock: LA will be reinvented."" Simon Sadler, Professor in Architecture UCD
 
How will we do this?
As architects and architecture students from the uk, we will tell the stories through drawings, photography, film, interviews and other writing in a collection of ‘urban essays’.  We will in our fieldwork prompt reactions as much as answers in our interview and engagement techniques and learn from the works of Raynar Banham “Los Angeles, The Architecture of Four Ecologies”, Mike Davies “City of Quartz”, Venturi & Scott Brown “Learning from Las Vegas”, Paul Auster’s “True Tales of American Life” & Archis “Mokum” & “Beyroutes” (to name but a few). As outsiders we will develop an observant journalistic dialogue with Los Angeles and work together to reveal new detail about this forever fascinating city.
 
The book is for...
Los Angeles and for readers around the world interested in architecture, society and city development. The stories we tell will be based on LA’s own experiences as they are told to us. The language will celebrate the diversity we encounter and the architecture will be experienced in sequence with life as it happens around it.

WE NEED YOU
All funding will go directly towards facilitating first-hand interviews, the making of the book and its publication in hardcopy and digital versions. With your support we will create an excellent book which captures this moment celebrating LA as it is now. Any additional funding will go towards hosting an exhibition of the work in London and LA and fund a travelling lecture to universities and architecture practices. When will it be ready?
We are aiming for a september 2017 publication, which will be the culmination of 4 years of research by Cultural Geometries lead by Christina Godiksen. Our first hand interviews and documentary of LA is planned for January 2017.

WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?
First of all our gratitude for helping us make this happen! We will credit your contribution in our the book and you can buy the book here through our pre-sale. We have created a few gift packages which range from designed tote bags, posters, book and film. Everything is our own original work.  


OTHER WAYS TO HELP
Please also share this with as many people you can, that would help us loads too. 
We have currently raised over £5000 with generous contributions from Weston Williamson and Karakusevic Carson Architects.
THE TEAM
Director/Editor:
Christina Godiksen - experienced architect and tutor, LA design review panelist. Founder of Cultural Geometries Research Community and CG Architecture ltd. 
“I have been going to LA for the past 3 years and seen visible change occurring year on year. As an outsider and visitor these changes appear perhaps starker and more tangible than to those who live in the change, which is why I believe that the ping pong we as a team can have in our direct engagement with the city, specific neighbourhoods and people, is critical in revealing a truly unique perspective which has not yet been documented. I will draw on my experience working with Archis on “Mokum” to direct the contributions and in my role as editor”

<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Amazing life transformation during and after divorce! You won't want to miss the amazing things that happened!!!</span></div>
<div>I had always believed my Ex-wife and I would live happily ever after, that the troubles facing so many other people would bypass us in lieu of others who weren't ""in love,"" but that bubble burst like a super nova and I fell hard.  <br/>
</div>
<div>About ten years ago my wife left me and my world fell apart. I thought I would be paralyzed before I would ever be divorced. It just wasn't a word in my vocabulary and it wasn't something I could comprehend, but here I was, labeled and defined by something that happened <i>to</i> me. I wrestled with grief and forgiveness for years and during the time following my divorce I lost three grandparents, several huge projects, as well as my finances. I faced the near loss of my house and something I could never get back, time with my precious daughter. </div>
<div>Like all of us who have experienced deep emotional trauma, I had a choice to make. I could wallow in self pity, remaining bitter and angry or I could choose the path of forgiveness and I could fight to heal. I chose the latter. I elected to heal and to love instead of hate, to forgive instead of remaining bitter. During the process I learned how I could actually overcome my struggles. I also learned there is a powerful force at work in our lives and that force is redemption. We are never too far from saving. <i>This book is that amazing story!!!</i>

<p>When you fund this book you will get a signed copy of the finished work when I get it published. If, for any reason, I cannot find a publisher I will self publish the book and get you a copy of the book, or a pfd of the book, depending on your level of investment.

Our nation is suffering. We have two generations of fatherless families and that number is on the rise. Divorce is running rampant and over 50% of all marriages are ending this way. This book takes a good hard look at the causes of so much suffering and helps its readers work to find the healing and peace they need while navigating the many challenges they experience through this painful process. </p>

<p>Having spent the last two years working with Dave Ramsey as the content producer of the new online video channel I am well aware of what it takes to create compelling stories that change peoples lives under a high pressure situation. While  I was there I also made wonderful contacts in the publishing industry and already have my book being read by a number of very talented professionals.</p>
<p>The primary obstacle to this book is going to be distribution, whether by a publisher or if I go the self published route. The way to overcome this challenge will to be to continue to share and promote the work though social media, churches, news outlets, and public speaking events. I am prepared to do what it takes to get this message out and I am excited to see how far it goes. </p>
<p>Honestly, part of it is really out of my hands. This story is much bigger than me.</p>

The money raised will help me pay my expenses, the artists for the cover art, and promotional material I need to create in order to find a good publisher. 

I am in a better place now then I ever was before. I am a better man, a better father and now a better husband (I recently remarried :). This is my story, the story of how I overcame my pain and even managed to thrive through it. I know my experiences and the things I learned are going to make a huge difference in our families and across our nation. I hope you will join me in changing someone's, After Happy Ever After.  What We Need & What You Get
 I am trying to raise $5000.00. I have about two months worth of work left to do and I need money to help pay for expenses, for the artists to create the cover art and any promotional materials I will need to find a good publisher. IE Website, animation, video or graphics.
When you fund this book you will get a signed copy of the finished work when I get it published. If, for any reason, I cannot find a publisher I will self publish the book and get you a copy of the book, or a pfd of the book, depending on your level of investment. I'm sure you're thinking of someone right now who is going through divorce and needs this book. It'll make a great gift and you'll be investing in their future.
In the event I don't reach my goal I will still keep fighting to finish this book in any way I can. All of the proceeds will go toward that end, regardless of the amount I receive.   The Impact After Happily Ever After, is a vitally important work. Our nation is suffering. We have two generations of fatherless families and that number is on the rise. Divorce is running rampant and over 50% of all marriages are ending this way. This book takes a good hard look at the causes of so much suffering and helps its readers work to find the healing and peace they need while navigating the many challenges they experience through this painful process. 
    Risks & Challenges Like all projects there is a certain degree of uncertainty and risk. However, the risks involving, After Happily Ever After are nominal. I have already finished the first draft of the book and with the help of my father, ten time published author David Crossman, I am certain it will be of the highest quality and caliber. 
Having spent the last two years working with Dave Ramsey as the content producer of the new online video channel I am well aware of what it takes to create compelling stories that change peoples lives under a high pressure situation. While  I was there I also made wonderful contacts in the publishing industry and already have my book being read by a number of very talented professionals.
The primary obstacle to this book is going to be distribution, whether by a publisher or if I go the self published route. The way to overcome this challenge will to be to continue to share and promote the work though social media, churches, news outlets, and public speaking events. I am prepared to do what it takes to get this message out and I am excited to see how far it goes. 
Honestly, part of it is really out of my hands. This story is much bigger than me.

    Other Ways You Can Help I would really appreciate your help in any way on this project. Even if you can't contribute financially, you can share the message with your friends and family. And, if you are a spiritually minded person, you can pray!

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The importance of Dorothy's life cannot be overemphasized.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Born in 1891, Dorothy Tiffany was the last child in the long line of the famous Tiffany dynasty of jewelers and artisans. As was expected of the young heiress, Dorothy married a wealthy member of the American plutocracy, Dr. Robert Burlingham.

Leaving behind her socially prominent husband, she took her children and moved to Europe, where she underwent psychoanalysis with Sigmund Freud.</p>
<p>Dorothy and her children became Sigmund and Anna Freud's longterm houseguests and intimate friends, developing a unique and storied extended family relationship that remains fascinating for its depth and complexity. But Dorothy's quest for fulfillment and a rich inner life ultimately had tragic consequences for those who were dearest to her as she embarked on a path that ultimately led to their downfall.</p>

<div>Hi there!  My name is Mica, but according to the little guy behind the curtain, my name is Gramouse!  I am the author of 'Baby Giant and the Chocolate Donuts', and Nolan Ray(Mouse) Burton is the three year-old idea man!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>He took a journey one night while sleeping and awoke with an outlandish tale of a scary monster named Baby Giant that ate ALL the chocolate donuts!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As he shared the details of his visit, I realized we had a tale to tell.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have had the passion to write a children's book for more years than I care to admit. Then  the story appeared!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I am a new author.  This is my first published book.  But guess what?  I already have a publisher!  I am so incredibly fortunate to have the backing and support of a first class publishing house that provides marketing support, first class editors, illustrators and major distribution companies.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>They provide distribution through independent book stores, major book stores, i.e. Barnes and Noble, Amazon, Kindle, Nook, etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Their authors support each other as a community rather than competing with one another...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So....you see...this is happening!  Baby Giant is ready to roar!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>The Story...</h3>
<div>In a dream one night, Nolan met Baby Giant, a scary monster who ate nothing but ""all the chocolate donuts"". He described where he lived and what he looked like, which included ""owies"" on his teeth, which Nolan said, were from eating nothing but chocolate donuts.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I took the story from there...  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Nolan is a good eater, and by that I mean he loves his fruits and veggies, and his beverage of choice is water - no sweet drinks for him!  And the meat he eats is hormone and antibiotic free, organic and grass fed.   </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>He is not perfect, mind you!  He does love his Gran and Gramouse's birthday cakes - no spoon or icing necessary!   (I'm thinking the love outweighs the effects of the sugar....)  But he does know what makes his muscles big
and strong (just ask him, he'll tell you) - fruits and veggies - and why Baby Giant has owies on his teeth -
all the chocolate donuts.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Nolan loves going out into Gramouse's garden (that she planted with help from the rabbits and birds....) to forage for tomatoes and such.  He either eats them straightaway or gives them to his little brother, Carson!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>He also loves cooking and baking.  He walks in my kitchen and is ready to bake a cake, BlendTec a smoothie or make juice!  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So, he decides to return to Baby Giant(with the help of his magic wand) and help him with his eating.  He knows Baby Giant is lazy and mean because of what he does and does not eat.  Baby Giant lives in a lush, fruitful land, so Nolan decides to show him all the neat things he can eat and drink (BG lives in a cave, and there is a free-flowing spring running through it).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Baby Giant learns and loves it!  He goes from donuts to do...nuts!</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Why 'Baby Giant and the Chocolate Donuts'?</h3> <p></p>

Self-reliance!  Brave guy!  </p>
<p>Only a fruit and veggie eating, sometime
sugar eating, night travelling, monster-fearing, magic wand wielding, wise little
boy could come up with this kind of mixed-up story!</p>

discover the magic and beauty born in the travels of one spunky three
year-old.  'Baby Giant and the Chocolate
Donuts' is an inviting children's picture book that looks at all this crazy
stuff and weaves it into one intriguing, humorous, informative, vibrant and
colorful story with many powerful messages! 
'Baby Giant' is a unique tale of wonder that pops right out of the
pages, grabs and pulls you in to a place you will never want to leave!</p>
<p>There is a need to help children with their fears.  </p>
<p>There is a need to open new food doors for

<p> There needs to be more ways to assist children  connect to their food.  </p>

<p>'Baby Giant and the Chocolate Donuts' takes all of these and weaves them

<h3>RETOS - CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>No ha sido fácil llegar hasta aquí. He tenido que hacer varios viajes a Europa y México. Obtener los pases de a cada corrida siempre fue un malestar que no se apaciguo hasta que tenia el pase en mano. Sin embargo creo que todo el trabajo ha valido la pena.

QUIEN SOY? - WHO AM I?

Carlos Cazalis es un fotógrafo profesional dedicado principalmente a trabajos documentales a largo plazo. Hago esto porque creo que es la mejor manera de obtener una mayor profundidad y perspectiva a sobre los temas que elijo. He sido galardonado con algunos premios internacionales y mi trabajo ha sido publicado y exhibido internacionalmente. El trabajo que les presento, es un foto libro que tardo siete años (2007-2015) en producirse. Hizo falta tiempo porque era imprescindible asegurar que una serie de eventos históricos se completarán en España, Francia y México.
Carlos Cazalis is a professional photographer dedicated to long-term documentary projects. I do this because I think it's the best way to gain a greater depth and perspective on the issues that I choose. I have been awarded several international awards and my work has been published and exhibited internationally. The work I present here to you is photography book that took seven years (2007-2015) to occur. It took this time because it was imperative to ensure that a number of historical events would be completed in Spain, France and Mexico.Mis orígenes son de una familia muy taurina de Aguascalientes, México con tres generaciones de matadores, pero yo elegí fotografiar en vez de matar por la admiración a la imagen donde comprendí  una filosofía, humanidad y ritual. Sin embargo no me considero taurino, pero esto es una parte de mi historia.My origins are from a taurine family in Aguascalientes, Mexico with three generations of matadors, but I chose to photograph instead, through the admiration of the image where I realized there was a profound philosophy, humanity and ritual. However I do not consider myself a bullfighting advocate, but this is a part of my story.

Jerez de la Frontera, 16 de Mayo de 2009
PROYECTO: SANGRE DE REYES - BLOOD OF KINGS
Voy a producir 2,000 copias de un foto libro intimo y fuerte sobre la aceptación de la muerte y que con su practica se aprende a vivir plenamente. Para contar esta historia hay dos personajes, uno es el matador José Tomás, quien además de ser considerado el último gran matador, es una persona intrigante que tarde a tarde a demostrando que estaba dispuesto a morir haciendo lo que mas amaba. Con esta pasión fue demostrando lentamente y toreando cada vez menos que vivir es saber morir. El otro personaje es el toro de lidia, un bellísimo animal, con una profunda nobleza a quien amamos por su existencia pero que sin embargo hacemos llegar a su muerte.

I will produce 2,000 copies of a photography book that is intimate and strong about the acceptance of death and that in this practice one learns to live fully. To tell this story there are two characters, one is the matador Jose Tomas, who besides being considered the last great matador, is an intriguing persona who in presentation after presentation shows that he is ready to die doing what he loves most. Through his passion he has slowly and bullfighting less and less to shown us that live is to know how to die. The other character is the bull, a very beautiful animal with a deep nobility whom we love for it’s existence but nevertheless we take him onto to his death.   

Con sus contribuciones, voy a imprimir y distribuir un foto libro, de alta calidad, con una impresión inconfundible, distribuido a nivel internacional por la editorial Catalana/Mexicana, la Editorial RM. Es un asunto económicamente, un poco caro, pero es la única manera de garantizar algo de calidad, durabilidad y de transcendencia digna de la historia y sus personajes que han ido mas allá de sus limites.

With your contributions, I will print and distribute this photo book at the highest quality, with an unmistakable printing and distributed internationally by the Catalan / Mexican publisher, Editorial RM. It is a bit pricey, but it's the only way to ensure something of quality, durability and significance worthy of the story and characters that have gone beyond their limits.

QUIEN PARTICIPA - WHO'S WHO
El libro cuenta con la colaboración de tres autores muy distintos y de gran estilo: el francés Jacques Durand, ex cronista del diario Liberation escribiendo de la pasión y sueño de ver a Tomás, el mexicano José Cueli, psicoanalista y ex cronista del diario La Jornada en una filosófica poesía y finalmente el escritor norte americano y corresponsal de guerra Jon Lee Anderson, hablando del guerrero. Un elemento mas de literatura nos da pausas de reflexión, son extractos facsimile del libro Pagan Spain  del ganador del Pulitzer, Richard Wright, con sus primeras impresiones de la inconfundible majestuosidad y fuerza del toro.

The book has the support of three very different and stylish authors: the French Jacques Durand, a former columnist for the newspaper Liberation writing on passion and the dream of seeing Jose Tomas, the Mexican Jose Cueli, psychoanalyst and former columnist for the Mexican daily La Jornada in a philosophical poetry and finally the North American writer and war correspondent from the New Yorker, Jon Lee Anderson, speaking of the warrior. Another element of literature that will provides us a pause for reflection, are excerpts from the book Pagan Spain, by the Pulitzer prize writer, Richard Wright, with his first impressions of the unmistakable majesty and power of the bull.

Finalmente el libro esta editado por el editor francés de Campos y Ruedos, François Bruschet y la curador mexicana Patricia Mercado y diseñado por las diseñadoras de N2Estudio en Madrid.

Review 


Moment of Truth (Trenutak Istine)

There’s always been some thinking. Self-knowledge or knowledge of the environment? It often doesn’t matter. Time periods are different, the question is do we recognize them. Our desires, our needs, our truths, it takes courage to admit to ourselves that after a long night, a new sun is born. One story after another, our lives go with hope for a better future. That’s our moment of truth.

Carnival of Rust (Karneval Rđe)


Pain, sorrow, anger, passion are emotions that moved writer to start writing this book. Sometimes, when we are cornered and don’t know what to do we have those emotions and want to burn the whole world. A moment later like rain is falling all over us and we feel like unprotected robots exposed to ones nemesis creating of us “Carnival of rust”.

Moonchild's Smile (Osmeh Mesečevog Deteta)


Love, often is just another unattainable term that fears us. White light is waiting for us somewhere at the end of the tunnel that provides only over needed tenderness. It is up to us to acknowledge and accept is as it is because it brings us smile on our faces every morning while giving us strength to step into new day.

Feather in the Well (Pero u Bunaru)


Insurgence, one of the biggest obstacles for the expansion of horizons. Teenage
days and worldviews that are inherent for people of that age. Love, family,
friends, life, everything boils down to two colors, black and white with
possible shades of gray, though learning to see the whole range of colors and
finding tiny little things that make us happy in the way of growing up and

Musical Lines (Notne Linije)


Sixty poems, with musical steps, make a lavish
dance. The poems are written in free verse, some swaying, they are not
constrained by any rhyme nor imperative detailed descriptions and explanations,
they begin and end where the thought is. Poet allows words to magically and

Risks & Challenges
 There are no risks for this project since I do have a publisher and a company that will print the books. I have already arranged everything with both companies so the only missing link in whole project is funding it.
I have set 30 days for this project since the challenge is to have printed books till the end of September current year. Reason for this is to have promotions I have mentioned earlier before Book Fair in Belgrade where my books should appear. Although, I don't see it as a race against time since books should be printed in two to three weeks top, so there is enough time to fulfill all plans before the ""big event"".

    Other Ways You Can Help If You are not able to contribute financially for this project, please, share it with Your friends, maybe they can. For any kind of support that You may provide to me, I am thankful from the bottom of my heart for helping me fulfill one of my biggest dreams!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<ul> <li>This campaign is simple. We'd like to build up a steady readership, already in place, before the inaugural issue of the CCQ is released. We'd also love to raise enough funding to increase the current $25 per story payment to authors by as much as we can (obviously, that would depend on how much we can raise, which is why I've chosen flexible funding for this campaign). But let me explain in finer detail:<br/>
</li>
<li>EMP Publishing recently launched an open call for our first anthology: Creepy Campfire Stories (for Grownups). The call was so successful, we were able to fill a 65,000 word anthology with the most amazing horror stories, featuring 19 incredibly talented authors. But a lot of other great writers didn't make the cut, not because their stories weren't good enough, but because we simply ran out of room (and budget) for a bigger book.</li>
<li>That is when I realized that Creepy Campfire Stories (CCS) had incredible franchise potential. So, the idea was hatched, and the new Creepy Campfire Quarterly (CCQ) was born. With our tight budget, the new quarterly anthology can only pay writers $25 per story and one contributor's copy, but this has not dissuaded authors from submitting. The maiden issue of CCS, slated for release on January 20, 2016, already has 16 incredible authors and stories lined up, with over 65,000 words of awesome and creepy horror.</li>
<li>We've got tons of authors submitting to the new quarterly. What we need now are dedicated readers. I'd like to launch into the first year of the CCQ's life with a steady readership in place, and build from there. So, again, this campaign is utterly simple: There are only four perks, including one year subscriptions to the CCQ for a flat rate of $55, and a two year subscription to the CCQ for a flat rate of $100.</li>
<li>Since the CCQ was born out of the amazing success of the original Creepy Campfire Stories (for Grownups) Anthology, slated for release on October 20, 2015, offers of that book for order now, are another available perk.</li>
<li>The Creepy Campfire Stories (for Grownups) Anthology was such a success, we've just launched NEXT October's 2nd annual Creepy Campfire Stories (for Grownups) SCIENCE FICTION horror edition! It is slated for release on October 25, 2016, and that is also available to order now, as a perk.</li>
<li>All funding raised through this campaign will be used to improve EMP Publishing's projects, namely the CCQ (Creepy Campfire Quarterly), by directly funneling into higher payments for the authors. We'd love to be able to, minimum, raise the $25 per story payment, for example, up to $50 or better. We can reach that initial goal with just $1000 funding raised. We could reach that with only 18 one-year subscriptions, or 10 two-year subscriptions! I know we can do this! I am confident we can reach at least the minimum goal, if not decently beyond.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that's left now is to show off some of the incredible cover designs by EMP Publishing's resident cover designer, Ms. Fatlind Colaku. She has designed both covers for the CCS editions, and will be our designer for ALL of the CCQ covers as well. Take a look at her work:</p>

<p>As a former journalist, I am usually the last person I would ever consider writing about, but after starting a blog (<a href=""kowalskikibitz.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.kowalskikibitz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kowalskikibitz.com</a>) during my Jewish studies (eventually leading to my conversion), I received a lot of positive feedback and intrigue from my readers.

<p>I began writing the <a href=""http://www.kowalskikibitz.com/uncategorized/becoming-jewish-memoir-in-progress/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first chapter</a> of my memoir earlier this year when a NY literary agent expressed interest in the project. However, I was unable to obtain an advance and unfortunately, as a struggling bohemian writer, it will not be possible for me to write this book without your support.</p>
<p>I take writing very seriously and it's impossible to write an entire book whilst working full-time. I pride myself on being detailed and accurate, which requires a lot of hours in research and cross-referencing. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So in order to shape this project into its utmost best, I'll need to give it the time and attention that it deserves.

<p>So why is it important for me to write this book? I've mulled over this question many times, thinking, maybe it's not worth it. I'm kind of embarrassed asking for money. I should just stick to writing corporate brochures or ghostwriting on a passionless topic. Do I really want to reveal myself? But then I realized, I'm Jewish now! I have chutzpah! Plus this is an important story with so many crucial themes and turning points dealing with faith, overcoming adversity, survival, struggle, finding hope and discovering that love really is everything. It's not just about words on a page, I want to create a piece of literature that inspires a humanitarian movement of kindness, compassion, tolerance, equality and Tikkun Olam (a call to heal and repair the world). </p>

I was born in Poland, but raised in Australia after immigrating with my mother at the age of three, in an attempt to escape the communist regime of the early eighties. Despite the fact that a majority of Jews had lived in Poland for centuries leading up to one of the worst human crimes in history (the Holocaust), I never knew what a Jew was and had never met a Jewish person, till I was 24-years old, working as a military journalist for the U.S. Navy in Chicago. I interviewed a Rabbi who was in the Chaplain's Department (for several articles including </span><a href=""http://www.kowalskikibitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Holocaust-Article-Kowalski.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">""A Rabbi's Perspective on the Holocaust""</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> during the Days of Remembrance and an article on the </span><a href=""http://www.kowalskikibitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Sukkot-Article.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Festival of Sukkot</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">). I befriended the Rabbi Lieutenant and from there my fascination with Judaism began.</span><br/></p>
<p>Since then I have overcome an existential crisis and converted to Judaism, traveled to Israel and Amsterdam, where I visited the Anne Frank museum/hideaway. Also to Poland to the site of the concentration camp in Auschwitz. I have been exposed to Jewish history serendipitously through my travels. It's as though Judaism subtly weaved its way into my life with little effort from me. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I have seen and experienced much in my life and spirituality and religion have had a huge impact on my emotional growth and identity.  </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Prior to Judaism, I didn't always have the right coping skills and at one point had lost the desire to live entirely. I toyed with danger and had been broken to the point of having no standards for anything, let alone myself. Judaism has provided me with a philosophy for living, a way of being and moving forward in this world with good intentions. It has also provided me with the skill-set to navigate through life in the midst of uncertainty and opposition. It's so easy to get lost during one of life's transitions or unforeseen circumstances when your beliefs are clouded and you don't have a moral code to follow or live by. My memoir, ""Becoming Jewish"" has the potential to change the way people view spirituality and religion. At the minimum, I hope it will inspire &amp; awaken! </span></p>

Despite the fact that a majority of Jews had lived in Poland for centuries leading up to one of the worst human crimes in history (the Holocaust), I never knew what a Jew was and had never met a Jewish person, till I was 24-years old, working as a military journalist for the U.S. Navy in Chicago. I interviewed a Rabbi who was in the Chaplain's Department (for several articles including ""A Rabbi's Perspective on the Holocaust"" during the Days of Remembrance and an article on the Festival of Sukkot). I befriended the Rabbi Lieutenant and from there my fascination with Judaism began.
Since then I have overcome an existential crisis and converted to Judaism, traveled to Israel and Amsterdam, where I visited the Anne Frank museum/hideaway. Also to Poland to the site of the concentration camp in Auschwitz. I have been exposed to Jewish history serendipitously through my travels. It's as though Judaism subtly weaved its way into my life with little effort from me. 
I have seen and experienced much in my life and spirituality and religion have had a huge impact on my emotional growth and identity.  Prior to Judaism, I didn't always have the right coping skills and at one point had lost the desire to live entirely. I toyed with danger and had been broken to the point of having no standards for anything, let alone myself. Judaism has provided me with a philosophy for living, a way of being and moving forward in this world with good intentions. It has also provided me with the skill-set to navigate through life in the midst of uncertainty and opposition. It's so easy to get lost during one of life's transitions or unforeseen circumstances when your beliefs are clouded and you don't have a moral code to follow or live by. My memoir, ""Becoming Jewish"" has the potential to change the way people view spirituality and religion. At the minimum, I hope it will inspire & awaken! 

I have always aspired to write a memoir and now I finally feel I have the right story to tell. Please support me on this journey! Even sharing this link with others is a huge help! Thank-you so much! Shalom! 
My Story...

  What We Need & What You Get I'm trying to raise the funds to support the writing of this book for the next 6-months. I have an agent interested, but I'm also willing to self-publish if for whatever reason it doesn't work out. So you will get a copy of the final printed book, guaranteed! 
The funds will also help with the cost of online promotion, advertising, proofreading and editing, and possibly printing. I'm planning for this memoir to reach epic heights, so I'm being very conscientious in currently building an online following and doing everything I can to get the word out. 
Even if you are unable to pledge, please support by sharing this link and make sure to follow me on Twitter and Facebook.  Also, to read more about my journey to Judaism, please visit my blog kowalskikibitz.com
I have great taste (only. partially. kidding.) and therefore some great perks  if you are able to support this campaign, including a Recycled ""Absolut"" Glass Mezuzah, chic LUCITE  dreidels, and original Jewish-themed photography  by artist/photographer Arick Maurice (will arrive autographed).  
      

    Risks & Challenges 

The biggest threat that I can foresee: well, there has been a resurgence of Anti-Semitism recently, particularly in parts of Western Europe, so writing on the topic of Judaism has the potential to spotlight me. Hopefully, I don't end up on some kind of hate list. However, it is also my hope to present a more liberal and objective perspective on Judaism that may dispel some of the biases and myths concerning Jews.

</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to give 1sentence a full-fledged website. 1sentence is a project where writers will write short stories based on the same single-sentence prompts. With your help, 1sentence.org will become a website where people can write, read, and review each other's work, and be part of a brand new short-story community.<br/></p>
<h3>History<br/>
</h3> <p>When I first started out writing, I didn't know where to begin. What should I write about? How do I make a good plot? How do I make characters that other people will like? In my very first lesson of ""just do it"", I turned to my friends for help, asking them to give me random single sentence prompts. I would then write short stories based off of them, and it worked beautifully. I ended up writing several stories, and a couple of them I was quite proud of (you can read a couple of them <a href=""https://pwhlee.wordpress.com/tag/short-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). That was three years ago. Now I am capable and confident enough to create my own stories, having had much experience in developing plot and forming characters.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I used this same idea to host a fun little project online. I made a few threads on reddit and on several writing communities and told people what was going to happen: I was going to release some random single sentence prompts, then I would write short stories based off of them, and anyone was free to join me. The part that I was most excited about was seeing all the different types of stories that people could make with the same premise. A prompt was released on the 1st and 15th of April, May, and June, and I asked people to host it on their own blog. If they didn't have a blog I hosted it on Google Docs. You can see the results at <b><a href=""http://www.1sentence.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.1sentence.org</a></b>.</p>
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>I was shocked that I was able to convince random strangers on the internet to participate in something. As I had hoped, there was a good variety among the stories and I was constantly impressed by what other people did with the prompts. Some of them are actually strong foundations for a potentially longer work.</p>
<p>Before the project began I predicted what the outcome would be: there would be high initial interest in the beginning, but participation would dwindle as it went on, and that's exactly what happened.</p>
<p>When I asked myself why this happened, I thought of two reasons: <br/></p>
<ol>
<li>It was a hassle for people to create their own blog to host their own stories, or to write them out and contact me so I could host them on google docs</li>
<li>There was no real incentive for them to create stories, beyond personal satisfaction, because I was the only one providing feedback on their work</li>
</ol>
<p>This made me think some more. What if I were able to solve these two problems? What if there was a website dedicated to this idea of getting people to write stories based on the same prompt, so that we could all see the different stories that came out of it, and be able to review and critique each other's work?</p>
<h3>Project Summary<br/>
</h3>I am trying to create a new ""1sentence.org"". Instead of just being a Wordpress website, people will be able to create an account, or log in with Facebook/Google, and submit stories directly to the website, as opposed to writing them elsewhere and having me host them. Readers will be able to read stories, add their favourite stories to their library, and follow their favourite authors. Writers will be able to share their stories on Facebook or Twitter. There will also be a forum for people to talk about their stories, the prompts, and whatever else they'd like. <br/><br/><p>The main content of the website will be the short stories. Every month there will be a new prompt. Anyone with an account will be able to submit one story for each prompt. Twice a year I will initiate the same marathon I did earlier this year: a prompt on the 1st and 15th of each month for three months, for a total of six short stories. Right now I'm thinking Dec-Jan-Feb and Jun-Jul-Aug. This avoids clashing with NaNoWriMo, aligns perfectly with the two polar seasons, and students are mostly out of school during these intervals, allowing for a higher rate of participation.</p>
<p>The <b>primary goal</b> of 1sentence.org will be to help writers become better 
writers. The secondary goal will be to provide free content for readers 
of any literary orientation.<br/></p>
<b>How Writers Become Better Writers</b><br/><br/>I believe there are two ways to become a better writer: write more, and get feedback. <br/><br/>The whole prompt aspect plus the marathons are challenges to see how creative you are, and to see if you can keep up with everybody else. You'll have to write in order to complete the stories on time. <br/><br/>As for getting feedback, the only rating system will be leaving a ""like"". There will be no thumbs down, downvote, or anything negative of the sort. If you like a story, you click the thumbs up. If you don't like it, you move on, but it'd be very helpful if you leave a comment telling the author how they could improve! All stories will be open for comments. <br/><br/>There will also be a Critique function, something a little more specific that readers can do. At the end of the story you'll have the choice to answer a short critique.<br/><br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439266561/jr6wwm5yodbldf6n7849.png"" src="""" style=""width: 583.669px; height: 739px;""/></p>If you choose to do a critique, you'll see only the topmost section first. Depending on what you select, the corresponding numbered section shows up next, then the thank you message. I was taught that plot, character, and narrative are the three most important elements in written storytelling, so hopefully this system allows writers to see what they excel at and what they could improve on, as represented by your story's feedback (which only you can see in your account's control panel):<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439267015/af3xf6pchk9ulmnhr6cu.png"" src="""" style=""width: 565.776px; height: 553px;""/></p>Keep in mind that these images, and anything else here, are just outlines, layouts, and/or sketches. Everything will look different once the final website is up and running.<br/><br/>
<p>All stories will be categorized under one or two genres, as chosen by the author. Readers thus have the choice to either read stories based on prompts, or based on genre (horror, fantasy, romance, etc.). <br/></p>
<p><b>New, Popular, and Spotlight</b></p>
<p>Stories listed on the front page and on each genre's webpage will be sorted under three headings. ""New"" will show the latest stories first. ""Popular"" lists the stories with the most views/likes. ""Spotlight"" is what will, hopefully, give everyone equal exposure. It will list stories that have been posted for a while but have yet to receive any comments or critiques. One problem with writing websites is that the best are usually highlighted while the rest sink to the bottom. The Spotlight feature is intended give each story a fair chance.<br/></p>
<p><b>Getting Published</b></p>
<p>I believe it is every writer's goal to be published; that is, to have their work produced into something physical. <br/></p>
<p>Twice a year there will be a three-month long marathon where a prompt will be released about once every two weeks. All stories submitted by the respective deadlines are eligible to be published in the 1sentence anthologies. </p>
<p>Each marathon will produce six prompts. What I envision is three of the best stories from each prompt being chosen to be a part of that anthology. That's eighteen stories total, potentially from eighteen different writers. How will the three stories from each prompt be chosen? The first story will be the highest rated (most number of likes), the second story will be editor's choice (that's me! I will choose the stories I feel to be the most creative, entertaining, and well-written, while adhering to the prompts themselves), and the third story... I have no idea yet. There are several categories/conditions I have in mind but for now I am still deciding (feel free to leave a comment if you have an idea!).<br/></p>
<p>If all goes according to plan 1sentence.org will be up and running by the end of this year. The first marathon will take place during Dec 2015, Jan 2016, and Feb 2016. The first prompt will be released on Dec 1, and everyone has until Dec 14 midnight to submit a story. This continues for Dec 15, Jan 1, Jan 15, Feb 1, and Feb 15. Three stories from each prompt will be chosen (highest rated, editor's choice, and ???). I will then get <i>1sentence 2016 Vol. 1</i> printed. It will have six sections, one for each prompt, divided into the three chosen stories. <br/></p>
<p>I definitely would like to have at least one volume printed. How many copies and the printing of future anthologies will depend on how popular 1sentence gets. For the record: authors retain first rights on their stories. <br/></p>
<h3>Funding<br/>
</h3>I am not a tech-savvy person. I do not know how to code. Thus, it is going to cost me $3,000 to get this website made. I have already found a web developer/designer, and we are working together to make 1sentence.org complete with the following features:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>account creation + Facebook/Google sign-in</li>
<li>preset avatars (you'll also be able to upload a custom image)<br/>
</li>
<li>base function of submitting stories (along with cover pictures), with likes, comments, critiques, and ""save for library"" features</li>
<li>mobile-friendly interface</li>
<li>message forums</li>
<li>anti-spam/security measures</li>
<li>a pleasing user interface (minimal and intuitive is the goal)</li>
</ul>
<p>The extra $500 will cover indiegogo/transfer fees, and hopefully be enough for webhosting for a year or two. It is my hope that 1sentence will eventually be able to sustain itself, but for now this will be a helpful kickstart!</p>
<p>If the goal is not reached, everything simply goes toward the web development budget.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>If funding surpasses the original goal, there are two immediate things the surplus will go to.</p>
<p>1. Marketing.<br/></p>2. Development of a 1sentence app for both Apple and Android devices. Right now, 1sentence.org will translate into a mobile-friendly interface if you access it via your mobile device's web browser, but we don't have plans to make an app yet. The purpose of the app will be to give 1sentence more of an e-reader feel, and also to make it easier for writers by having an offline mode where they can write or record ideas.<br/><br/>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Originally I was going to do the usual stuff like t-shirts, notebooks, and pens customized with the 1sentence logo, but I've decided those things aren't really valuable. They only help market 1sentence's brand, which is what I eventually want, but here at the beginning and what I hope to be for a long time, I'd like to put the community first. I've done a bit of thinking, and I feel the perks to the right are pretty fun and/or meaningful. <br/></p>
<p><b>1s gold</b></p>
<p>The gold account is basically a premium membership. In return for your support of 1sentence you will be given a few perks on the website. Right now, a gold membership gives you access to a super-secret message board for cool kids, grants you permission to submit stories to prompts that have been closed, and lets you submit more than one story for each prompt. Perhaps gold members will also be given an exclusive avatar. Things are still in development, and I hope to be able to provide more perks as this project moves along.<br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>Monetary assistance isn't the only way you can help! There are two things you can do to help 1sentence.org become the best website it can be:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Spread the word! The buttons on the left let you share on Facebook or Twitter. If you know anyone interested in writing, but haven't really started yet, let them know about this project!</li>
<li>Give me your opinion! What do you think of the entire concept? Do you like how everything works? What else would you like to see? Any comments or suggestions will be much appreciated! I can't promise everything will be implemented, at the beginning or ever, but all ideas are welcome and will be considered!</li>

neighborhood of Cerro Alegre and center city Valparaiso, the movie poses the
question on cruelty, how people may get lost in the underworld and how silence
can be able to cut like a sharpened knife. Alvaro says: “We have all
experienced the absence of a reply and feel identified. Valparaiso inspired
Eduardo to write the poems, and they became the foundation for this movie”.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440728025/agp8p4ed8tlqz1cteqyq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 337.218px;height: 450px;""/></b></p><p style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441058638/y3k3ii4ey16icl9wfdij.png"" src="""" style=""width: 41.4814814814815px;height: 28px;""/>   Con la ayuda del director colombiano Álvaro Ruiz,

primer largo: <i>La novia del torero</i>,

que sobre el papel pueden llegar a ser abstractos, detrás de su cámara logran
un sentido más real y sugerente. Filmada en las playas, el puerto, el Cerro
Alegre, el centro y demás locaciones de Valparaiso, la película plantea la
crueldad del hombre, la forma en que se puede perder en los bajos fondos y esa
ausencia en la que el silencio puede llegar a rajar como cuchillo. El propio
Álvaro Ruiz, dice: “Todos hemos vivido una ausencia. En ese sentido nos
sentimos identificados. A Eduardo, Valparaiso le inspiró los poemas que luego
se volvieron el telón de fondo para hacer el proyecto”.</p>

since the beginning of early cinema, and D. W. Griffith´s silent movies or
feature films from Jodorosky may be very poetic, on the words of Alvaro Ruiz:
“The project is innovative in the sense that it is an experiment which has been
done in very few occasions. The production arises from the poems and sticks to
the poems. It doesn’t build an independent story from them. One thing is to
have poetical images and another one to build from the text and create
something new that respects the text. It also allows the creation of another
product which comes out of the poems. In this way, the set of poems acquires another life which reaches another public through new technologies: people are
used to reading audiovisual language. The result is not a representation of the
poems, but rather an interpretation. The public has to find its own
interpretation based upon the construction that comes from mixing the images
and the words. With that, the spectator starts becoming part of the film and
fills the blanks in ""Light"" and ""Darkness"", both somehow a little bit
abstract. ""Silence"" is more narrative,
since it states the absence of the reply. The poetical voice talks to another
person who is represented by a woman in the movie”. </p><p><br/></p>

desde  el inicio del séptimo arte, y las
películas mudas de D. W. Griffith pertenecientes a las primeras etapas del cine
o producciones como las de Jodorosky, pueden ser muy poéticas, en las palabras
de Álvaro Ruiz: “El proyecto es novedoso en el sentido en que es un experimento
que se ha hecho muy poco. La producción parte de los poemas y se circunscribe a
los poemas. No arma una narración independiente a partir de ellos. Una cosa es
que las imágenes sean poéticas, y otra, partir del texto y crear algo nuevo que
respete el texto. Además permite crear, a partir de los poemas, otro producto.
Así se les da otra vida que se trasporta y le llega a otras personas,
valiéndose de las tecnologías de hoy en día, donde hay gente acostumbrada a
leer el lenguaje audiovisual. El resultado final no es una representación de
los poemas, sino una interpretación, en la que el público tiene que encontrar la
suya propia, basado en lo que construye la mezcla de imágenes y palabras. Con
ello el espectador se va volviendo parte de la obra y llena los vacíos en los
casos de <i>Luz</i> y <i>Oscuridad</i>, que son abstractos. <i>Silencio</i>
es un poco más narrativo en vista de que plantea una ausencia. La voz poética
le habla a otro que está ausente, y dentro del rodaje está representado por una
mujer”.</p><p><br/></p><p><b></b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440731037/hrq6dw3oszukxbtamx1w.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 453px;height: 340px;""/></p><br/><p style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We need you</b><br/></p>

    En los meses de junio y julio de 2015 tuvimos la
oportunidad de rodar las  producciones de
Luz, oscuridad y silencio, en
Valparaiso, Chile, y Lobos tendidos en la
playa…, en la costa de Rocha, Uruguay. Éstas son un par de películas de los libros de
poemas del mismo nombre, que el escritor colombiano Eduardo Bechara Navratilova,
quiere traer a la pantalla grande.
The productions:
""Light, Darkness and Silence""
   Set in Valparaiso and composed of three sets of poems, ""Light, Darkness and Silence"", has the gravitational pull that seems to touch
everything in the post dictatorship Chile: a country which is still breathing
over its open wounds. Poems ""6"" from ""Light"", ""5"", from ""Darkness"" and ""1"", from ""Silence"", are examples:
               “A human being under the light
               is an actor,
               a murder suspect,
               a rock star,
               someone being tortured,
               a woman giving birth,
               a corps under examination” 
               “Darkness is darkness
               in the teenager 
               that walked through it
               without noticing the cliff…
                Darkness is
darkness
               in the teenager
               that resisted
               electrical whips
               and is damaged for life”
               “Silence is a powerful weapon
               white noise where
               birds
               sing their disappear,
               the absence of language,
               a numb heartbeat
               where glances drown.
Las producciones:
Luz, oscuridad y silencio  Compuesto por tres poemarios Luz, Oscuridad y Silencio, y con el trasfondo de Valparaiso como escenario, tiene ese peso gravitacional que parece impregnarlo todo en el chile post dictadura, un país en el que aún se respira sobre las heridas abiertas. Los poemas 6 de Luz, 5
de Oscuridad y 1 de Silencio, ayudan a
ejemplificarlo:
               “Un ser humano bajo la luz
               es un actor,
               un sospechoso de homicidio,
               una estrella de rock,
               un torturado,
               una mujer pariendo,
               un cadáver en su autopsia…”
               “La oscuridad es oscuridad
               en la adolescente
               que caminó en ella
               sin advertir el paso en el vacío…
               La oscuridad es oscuridad
               en el adolescente que resistió
               látigos eléctricos
               y quedó averiado de por vida…”
               “El silencio es un arma poderosa,
               un ruido blanco en el que los
               pájaros
               cantan su desesperanza,
               la ausencia de la lengua,
               un pálpito mudo
               en el que se ahogan
               las miradas”.

""Seals Lying on the Beach…""
   ""Seals Lying on
the Beach, Dancing Penguins and the Life of Other Animals"", is a journey through the
essence of life, nature's renewal and its cycles: birth, life and death. The
scenes of seals, tortoises, penguins, birds and other animals, that show the
different stages of decomposition, accompany sets of poems that point out how newly born beings take substance from dead ones, the same way other beings will take from them once they have died. 

The beach is the Universe in which everything
becomes dust, where everything intertwines and matter passes from one being the
other. Poem ""5"", from ""Other Conversations With the Sea"", provides an example:
                   “This world is the place
                   where we all
                   are matter
                   that never
                   stops changing…
                   Microbes, animals,
                   insects,
                   and human beings
                   mutate
                   from one to the other”.

Lobos tendidos en la playa…
   Lobos tendidos en la playa,
pingüinos danzantes y la vida de otros animales, es un viaje por la esencia de la vida, la renovación
de la naturaleza y los ciclos del nacimiento, la vida y la muerte. Las tomas de
leones marinos, tortugas, pingüinos y aves que muestran los distintos estados
de descomposición, acompañan una serie de poemas en los que se indica cómo los
seres que nacen toman de los que han muerto, así como, a su vez, algún otro ser tomará de
ellos cuando mueran. 

La playa es el universo en el que todo se vuelve polvo, en
el que todo se hermana, y en el que la materia va mutando de un ser a otro. El
poema 5 de Otras conversaciones con el
mar, lo ejemplifica:
                   “Este mundo es el lugar
                   donde todos somos
                   materia que nunca
                   cesa de cambiar…
                   Microbios, animales, 
                   insectos
                   y seres humanos,
                   mutamos
                   los unos en los otros.”    With the help of Colombian film director, Alvaro Ruiz,
author of shorts like ""Daybreak"", who is close to filming his first feature film: ""The bullfighters girlfriend"", the set of poems ""Light, Darkness and Silence"", that on paper may be abstract, under his lens become
more revealing and suggestive. Filmed on the beaches, the port, the
neighborhood of Cerro Alegre and center city Valparaiso, the movie poses the
question on cruelty, how people may get lost in the underworld and how silence
can be able to cut like a sharpened knife. Alvaro says: “We have all
experienced the absence of a reply and feel identified. Valparaiso inspired
Eduardo to write the poems, and they became the foundation for this movie”.   Con la ayuda del director colombiano Álvaro Ruiz,
autor de cortos como Amanecer, La trilogía del abrazo y Tierra caliente, próximo a rodar su
primer largo: La novia del torero,
los poemas de Luz oscuridad y silencio,
que sobre el papel pueden llegar a ser abstractos, detrás de su cámara logran
un sentido más real y sugerente. Filmada en las playas, el puerto, el Cerro
Alegre, el centro y demás locaciones de Valparaiso, la película plantea la
crueldad del hombre, la forma en que se puede perder en los bajos fondos y esa
ausencia en la que el silencio puede llegar a rajar como cuchillo. El propio
Álvaro Ruiz, dice: “Todos hemos vivido una ausencia. En ese sentido nos
sentimos identificados. A Eduardo, Valparaiso le inspiró los poemas que luego
se volvieron el telón de fondo para hacer el proyecto”.
Poetry and cinema
   Although poetry and cinema have gone hand in hand
since the beginning of early cinema, and D. W. Griffith´s silent movies or
feature films from Jodorosky may be very poetic, on the words of Alvaro Ruiz:
“The project is innovative in the sense that it is an experiment which has been
done in very few occasions. The production arises from the poems and sticks to
the poems. It doesn’t build an independent story from them. One thing is to
have poetical images and another one to build from the text and create
something new that respects the text. It also allows the creation of another
product which comes out of the poems. In this way, the set of poems acquires another life which reaches another public through new technologies: people are
used to reading audiovisual language. The result is not a representation of the
poems, but rather an interpretation. The public has to find its own
interpretation based upon the construction that comes from mixing the images
and the words. With that, the spectator starts becoming part of the film and
fills the blanks in ""Light"" and ""Darkness"", both somehow a little bit
abstract. ""Silence"" is more narrative,
since it states the absence of the reply. The poetical voice talks to another
person who is represented by a woman in the movie”. 
Poesía & cine
   Si bien la poesía y el cine han estado emparentados
desde  el inicio del séptimo arte, y las
películas mudas de D. W. Griffith pertenecientes a las primeras etapas del cine
o producciones como las de Jodorosky, pueden ser muy poéticas, en las palabras
de Álvaro Ruiz: “El proyecto es novedoso en el sentido en que es un experimento
que se ha hecho muy poco. La producción parte de los poemas y se circunscribe a
los poemas. No arma una narración independiente a partir de ellos. Una cosa es
que las imágenes sean poéticas, y otra, partir del texto y crear algo nuevo que
respete el texto. Además permite crear, a partir de los poemas, otro producto.
Así se les da otra vida que se trasporta y le llega a otras personas,
valiéndose de las tecnologías de hoy en día, donde hay gente acostumbrada a
leer el lenguaje audiovisual. El resultado final no es una representación de
los poemas, sino una interpretación, en la que el público tiene que encontrar la
suya propia, basado en lo que construye la mezcla de imágenes y palabras. Con
ello el espectador se va volviendo parte de la obra y llena los vacíos en los
casos de Luz y Oscuridad, que son abstractos. Silencio
es un poco más narrativo en vista de que plantea una ausencia. La voz poética
le habla a otro que está ausente, y dentro del rodaje está representado por una
mujer”.We need you
   So that the films can enter their production and postproduction stages, we need your help. The crowdfunding will help pay the money invested in the shooting, the edition, the design, the composition and recording of the music, the color adjusting, all other technical details, and all and all, will help the movies come alive, allow people to see poetry through an integration of genres, will help increase the exposition of poetry and break the stereotype thinking that poetry is only for poets, may be boring or that its public is to narrow. Once the production reaches its final stage, the movies will be sent to different festivals like Cannes, Sundance or Karlovy Vary, among others.
This project arises form a personal concern, but the
objective is to be able to continue producing new poetry films: from the
success of this production depends the production of other films made from
books and poems from other authors, that can be taken to the big screen and
help built the interdisciplinary bond. Help us. Become a sponsor, have a direct
influence in the strengthening of poetry, and be a participant in a project
which aims to take poetry and different poets to cross their own boundaries.Thank you very much.
Te necesitamos
   Para que los rodajes puedan entrar a su etapa de producción y postproducción, necesitamos de su ayuda. Lo recaudado servirá para que se pague la inversión del rodaje, la edición, el diseño, la composición y grabación de música, la corrección del color, algunos otros detalles técnicos, y permitirá la visualización de la poesía a través de una integración de géneros, aumentará su exposición al público y ayudará a romper el estereotipo de que la poesía es sólo para los poetas, que puede ser aburrida o que su público es demasiado restringido. Una vez acabada la producción, las películas se enviarán a concursar a festivales como Cannes, Sundance, Karlovy Vary y otros.
Este proyecto es una inquietud personal, pero el
objetivo es poder continuar haciendo otros nuevos: del éxito de esta producción
depende la producción de nuevos rodajes de otros poetas, cuyo poemario o libro,
pueda ser llevado a la pantalla grande e ir ampliando así el nexo
interdisciplinario. Ayúdenos y conviértase en un patrocinador, tenga una
injerencia directa en el fortalecimiento de la poesía y vuélvase partícipe de
un proyecto que pretende llevar a la poesía y a diferentes poetas, a traspasar
sus propias fronteras.Muchas gracias

<p>               I have decided to create this Indiegogo project to attempt to accomplish a few things. Before travelling this past summer, I brainstormed about different ways that I could document my travels. I knew I would want to keep record of what was sure to be an amazing adventure, I just wasn't sure about the best method for completing said task. <br/><br/>            Within the first few rumbles of thunder, I wrestled with the idea of filming the whole adventure. I soon tossed this idea off the deck after researching editing and production costs. Also, I feared that it would ultimately take away too much from the experience or the trip if I was constantly fiddling with a camera. When you focus all of your attention on capturing amazing events, it can sometimes leave you unable to experience those amazing events. So a film was not the path I was willing to go down for this particular adventure.</p>
<p>           Clarity finally came at the eye of the storm, when I had the idea to journalize all of my experiences in a notepad. A simple idea, but a clear one non the less. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This was certainly not the end of this thunderous brain storm. During my summer travels, I eventually decided that I would edit and collectivize my journal entries into a physical book, for family, friends, and me to recollect, remember, and reminisce . This book is a piece of me, and I am excited to share my experiences with others on a much richer level than what social media allows.</span></p>
<p><br/>         The idea of designing a crowd-funding campaign to raise money to accomplish my goal of self-publishing a book didn't come to me until the book neared completion. I decided on the idea that I would try raise enough money to publish one copy of the book for each of the amazing people who pledged to my campaign and the shipping costs for the books. Any extra funding made in the process of this project will go directly to the creation of further travel journals.   I have yet to see the northern half of this great country, so this summer I plan to travel around the northwest part of the continental 48 where a majority of our nation's national parks lie. I have 19 states left to see not counting Hawaii or Alaska, but I digress.<br/><br/></p>
<p>        The final, and most important goal of this project is to inspire. Inspire to desire. Desire to travel, desire to experience new sights, sounds, tastes, and smells; Desire to live. Most importantly, desire to inspire others to do the same. Variety is the spice of life, and I want this book to remind me, as well as all others, to always be in search of new and fulfilling experiences as well as exercising artistic expression.  If this project inspires even one person(even myself) to travel even a little bit more, than I will feel completely accomplished and fulfilled!</p>

<div>Here's the cover description for The Singer.</div>
<div><i>Darkness is spreading, and the world needs a Song. <br/>Cephra A'Fallel was born to privilege as a daughter of one of Aryam’s noble houses. Her pampered life, however, is little more than a gilded cage of which she has faint hope of escape. Her only solace is her music, her unique gift that relieves the tedium of her regimented existence. Though her golden voice enchants all who hear it, Cephra’s singing of an ancient text reveals its true power. <br/>She is a Singer. More than a natural talent, her Gift is an echo of the power that called the universe into being – the power of Olam, who gave life to all things. The scriptures tell of the Singers, and of the Sundering, a terrible moment when the world was divided in two and Aryam was cast into shadow. For untold millennia, faithful Singers maintained the balance between the worlds, calling forth light and keeping the darkness at bay. Now, in an age of peace and prosperity, the Singers are fading into myth and Olam is forgotten. <br/>A dark and alluring cult is gaining influence over the nobility. Living shadows are stalking the halls of power, threatening to plunge all of Aryam into eternal night. <br/>Cephra finds herself at the threshold of an ancient, invisible war. The scriptures foretell the time of the last Singer, who will battle the darkness and challenge the Sundering itself. As she comes to terms with her destiny, Cephra’s voice will reveal a hidden world more terrifying and more wondrous than she could have ever imagined.<br/></i></div>

</div></div>","In Short
Hi. My name is Timothy Taylor and I'm a writer and an artist. I've written all kinds of things, from articles on cooking and travel and art to web content for companies such as eBay and StubHub. My passion, however, is fiction. Recently, I released my debut novel called The Singer, an epic adventure set in a fantastic world built  on music. 

It's just the first in The Last Singer Trilogy, and I have a golden opportunity to write the second book in the series and promote it. That's where you can help. 



How You Can Help
For the next 6 to 12 months I'll be interning with Defining Moments, a ministry devoted to helping people discover their calling and achieve their goals. I'll be serving as a staff writer, and in exchange I'll be receiving one-on-one coaching to market my work and expand my platform and audience as a writer. 
I'll also be living in Dallas during that time, which will provide me with several opportunities to network across multiple industries. This season will also give me a chance to focus on my writing and complete The Seer, the sequel to The Singer.
I just need to raise support to cover day-to-day, general living expenses and to help me promote the book and donate copies. For every $100 the campaign raises, I can give one copy each of The Singer and The Seer to a library or school.
I don't expect something for nothing so I want offer some fun perks to make it worth your while. I'm offering things like advanced copies of The Seer and a short story that you'll get access to before anyone else does. I've also got some original art work in the mix and an opportunity to see your very own name in print. 
Every donation will also be tax deductible.

<h3>À propos</h3>
</div>
<p>Je suis Audrey Desrosiers, intervenante en zoothérapie depuis 2008 et je partage mon quotidien avec les enfants qui parfois doivent relever certains défis. J'ai eu l'idée de développer cette histoire comme outil d'intervention alors que le ""trop-cool-pré-ado"" avec qui je travaillais ne parvenait pas à surmonter ses difficultés et à trouver des solutions avec les outils disponibles. L'histoire a fonctionné! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About </h3>
<p><i>I'm Audrey Desrosiers, I have been an Animal-Assisted Therapist (AAT) since 2008 and I share my day to day with children who are often confronted with rather particular challenges. I created this story as an intervention tool when dealing with a pre-teen client who's budding rebellious nature was preventing him from successfully using the tools that had been put at his disposal.<br/>The story worked!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Au cours des deux dernières années, Élias et les doigts magiques a été au coeur de plus d'une centaine d'ateliers que j'ai offerts dans les multiples bibliothèques de Montréal et un peu partout au Québec. Les enfants sont unanimes...ils adorent l'univers d'Élias et se reconnaissent en lui. Leur rétrospection est spectaculaire (ne le sont-ils pas toujours, spectaculaires?)</p>
<p>En plus d'être touchante, drôle, accessible et actuelle, elle est également pédagogique et empreinte de sensibilité. Elle parvient à ouvrir tendrement une porte vers le monde intérieur des enfants.</p>
<p><i>Throughout the past two years, I have given over a hundred workshops using this story throughout a multitude of libraries in Montreal and all around Quebec. The reaction from children (and in most cases their parents) was unanimous, they adored Elias, and without fault they all fell in love with the tale; they saw something of themselves in him. And their retrospections were spectacular(Aren't they always).</i></p>
<p><i>Not only is the story touching, funny, accessible, and current, it is also pedagogical, sensible and manages to gently open a door to the interior universe of children.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Approuvée par les professionnels, parents conquis!</h3>
<p>Dans le cadre de ma profession, j'ai eu la chance de côtoyer des familles extraordinaires ainsi que des collègues attentionnés qui, dans leur milieu respectif, l'ont mise à l'essai. Les commentaires sont plus que positifs. Le livre, à être publié dans les deux langues (français et anglais), a réellement été apprécié. Élias est donc maintenant prêt à voir le jour officiellement!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Approved by Professionals and Parents Alike</h3>
<p><i>Throughout my practice I've had the chance to meet some wonderful people, families of patients and colleagues alike, who all in their respective fields, tried the story and returned to me with extremely positive feedback and results. Elias is now officially ready to be unveiled to the world.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Mon parcours</h3>
<p>Diplômée du monde des arts et de la musique, j'ai terminé mon cursus scolaire en zoothérapie en 2008. Créative et grandement motivée, je démarre mon entreprise ""Au bout du Museau"". La zoothérapie n'en était alors qu'à ses balbutiements. Aussi, m'investis-je corps et âme dans le développement, l'expansion et la reconnaissance de celle-ci.</p>
<p>En 2010, forte de mes deux années de succès et d'efforts, je codémarre la clinique Un Museau vaut mille maux. Ma passion brûlante pour les enfants et les défis quotidiens qu'ils rencontrent m'a poussé vers l'enseignement pendant trois ans en plus d'offrir de nombreuses formations et ateliers, de développer leur contenu et bon nombre d'outils d'intervention. Il s'en suit des mois et des années de labeur pour constituer une équipe du tonnerre et parfaire mes connaissances, ajoutant ainsi plusieurs cordes à mon arc. J'ai aussi eu la chance en 2016 de mettre à l'épreuve cette histoire ailleurs dans le monde, confirmant ce que je savais déjà;  ici ou là-bas, les enfants restent les mêmes, leurs besoins, leurs désirs... les yeux brillants!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>My Career Path</h3>
<p><br/><i>I graduated from the world of Arts and music, and obtained my AAT diploma in 2008.<br/>Creative and  highly motivated, I founded <strong>Au bout du Museau</strong>. At the time, AAT in Canada was still in its infancy, I dedicated every waking moment to the propagation and development of my company.</i></p>
<p><i>I</i><i>n 2010, after two years of hard work, I found a business partner and we co-founded Un Museau vaut mille maux. Throughout this period, my passionate interest in children's special needs and their daily challenges led me to teaching for a period of 3 years where after having extensively studied in the field, I perfected and innovated a variety of classes and formations pertaining to special needs education. Following this, I created a star team of employees and coworkers, constantly expanding the clinic and refining my knowledge. In 2016 I had the chance to test run my Elias and the magic fingers story elsewhere in the world, the results were as I had expected, wherever I went, the children were still children, their needs... their desires....and that twinkle in their eyes!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Le projet</h3>
<p> Maintenant, ""Élias et les doigts magiques"" a besoin de votre soutien pour voir le jour!</p>
<p>Je désire que ce magnifique univers, cette histoire, prenne vie dans vos familles et dans vos écoles. Non seulement le livre sera-t-il publié, mais les figurines d'Élias et de la petite fée ""pas fine"" seront également au rendez-vous!  </p>
<p>Et si vous rêvez avec moi, vos jeunes pourront également s'endormir avec le livre audio. Et pourquoi ne pas viser la publication de cette histoire en diverses langues? Il n'en tient qu'à vous!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><i>Now, ""Elias and the magic fingers"" needs your support so it can see the day!</i></p>
<p><i>I want my universe to come alive, I want Elias to spring to life and take up residence in the hearts of your families, of your schools, and not only as litterature; Elias and his little faerie sidekick will also have a physical form!</i></p>
<p><i>And if you dream as I do, your children will be able to fall asleep listening to the audio book.<br/>And while we're at it, why not have this story translated into multiple languages. The choice is yours!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>L'équipe, LA rencontre ! </h3>
<p>Plus de deux ans se sont écoulés, à évoluer dans l'univers d'Élias et à attendre LA rencontre professionnelle, la rencontre <i>""nucléaire""</i>, qui permettra de donner vie aux traits, à l'imaginaire, à la vision d'Élias, celle qui lui revient... et 2016 me l'a offert! </p>
<p>Par les mains magiques d'Émilie Huot le rêve devient enfin réalité! Nos deux univers et nos sensibilités artistiques se complètent à merveille. Notre vision de l'enfant et nos valeurs communes ont finalement donné lieu à cette magie tant espérée! Nos rêves sont nombreux, nos créations naturelles et nécessaires. C'est le ""match"" parfait! </p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><i>I had spent many years searching vainly for that special person who's vision was similar to mine, someone with whom the magic could happen, someone who's imagination could conjure up images to go with the words, and this year, I found her.</i></p>
<p><i>It is through the magical hands of Emilie Huot that the dream will spring to life!<br/>Our two universes and artistic sensibilities meld seemlessly together as though it were meant to be, our views on children, and our values, everything, like nuclear fission, it is springing to life, naturally, and necessarily, it is truly the perfect match!​</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Émilie Huot </h3>
<p>Crayons à la main dès son jeune âge, remplissant les marges de ses cahiers d'écoles de dessins, Émilie complète un parcours académique en arts visuels, incluant quelques volets en architecture et design. Une quête afin de rendre une vision du monde, à sa façon.</p>
<p>Fascinée depuis toujours par le monde du vivant, elle explore de multiples médiums. Depuis quelques années après l'arrivée de son fils, Émilie se concentre sur l'art du tatouage qui lui permet de réaliser un rêve; illustrer à temps plein.</p>
<p>Et aujourd'hui le rêve continue ! </p>
<p>/ </p>
<p><br/>She spent her childhood; crayons in hand; filling up the margin of her school books with artwork. Searching for the tools too portray the world through her eyes, <br/>Emilie completed her studies at an academy of visual arts, she also studied in architechture and design.<br/>She has always been fascinated with the world of the living, and has explored multiple artistic mediums.<br/>Since the arrival of her son in her life, Emilie has concentrated her time on being a tattoo artist <br/>in order to her to make her dream of illustrating full time a reality. <br/>And so the dream continues!</p>

I want my universe to come alive, I want Elias to spring to life and take up residence in the hearts of your families, of your schools, and not only as litterature; Elias and his little faerie sidekick will also have a physical form!
And if you dream as I do, your children will be able to fall asleep listening to the audio book.And while we're at it, why not have this story translated into multiple languages. The choice is yours!
 
L'équipe, LA rencontre ! 
Plus de deux ans se sont écoulés, à évoluer dans l'univers d'Élias et à attendre LA rencontre professionnelle, la rencontre ""nucléaire"", qui permettra de donner vie aux traits, à l'imaginaire, à la vision d'Élias, celle qui lui revient... et 2016 me l'a offert! 
Par les mains magiques d'Émilie Huot le rêve devient enfin réalité! Nos deux univers et nos sensibilités artistiques se complètent à merveille. Notre vision de l'enfant et nos valeurs communes ont finalement donné lieu à cette magie tant espérée! Nos rêves sont nombreux, nos créations naturelles et nécessaires. C'est le ""match"" parfait! 
The Team
I had spent many years searching vainly for that special person who's vision was similar to mine, someone with whom the magic could happen, someone who's imagination could conjure up images to go with the words, and this year, I found her.
It is through the magical hands of Emilie Huot that the dream will spring to life!Our two universes and artistic sensibilities meld seemlessly together as though it were meant to be, our views on children, and our values, everything, like nuclear fission, it is springing to life, naturally, and necessarily, it is truly the perfect match!​
 
Émilie Huot 
Crayons à la main dès son jeune âge, remplissant les marges de ses cahiers d'écoles de dessins, Émilie complète un parcours académique en arts visuels, incluant quelques volets en architecture et design. Une quête afin de rendre une vision du monde, à sa façon.
Fascinée depuis toujours par le monde du vivant, elle explore de multiples médiums. Depuis quelques années après l'arrivée de son fils, Émilie se concentre sur l'art du tatouage qui lui permet de réaliser un rêve; illustrer à temps plein.
Et aujourd'hui le rêve continue ! 
/ 
She spent her childhood; crayons in hand; filling up the margin of her school books with artwork. Searching for the tools too portray the world through her eyes, Emilie completed her studies at an academy of visual arts, she also studied in architechture and design.She has always been fascinated with the world of the living, and has explored multiple artistic mediums.Since the arrival of her son in her life, Emilie has concentrated her time on being a tattoo artist in order to her to make her dream of illustrating full time a reality. And so the dream continues!

</h3><p>Telling the real story of New York — offering an account that’s more inclusive, accurate and accessible than what you usually find in travel guides or academic cultural studies — has never been more important than it is today.  The United States is the world’s largest economy, ahead of China, Germany, Japan, the UK, and France; and New York is the biggest driving force within America’s economic picture. In fact, not only is New York the largest economy in America, it’s the world’s most economically powerful city.  New York is also deeply influential in the arts and entertainment industries, as well as other industries that help shape and define culture.  Finally, in a world where tolerance and multiculturalism has recently come under serious threat, New York remains as a beacon for the broad scope of the human experience.  So it's no wonder then that millions of people gravitate to New York every year.</p><p>But New York is a very complex city.  While it is certainly a place full opportunity and excitement, it is also a place that can be quite unforgiving, especially to those who are unfamiliar to its unique flow and general character.  This is why before you move to New York, you should know what you’re <i>really</i> getting into.  And if you’re already living in New York, but haven’t quite figured things out yet or would like to expand your understanding of this town, then there are a number of things you need to know if you plan on extending your stay or if you simply want to get more out of the time that you still have left here.</p><p>Typical travel guides won’t really help you in this regard, as they tend to focus primarily on “what to do” lists, chasing down a fun time and that sort of thing. Instead, people who are interested in living or spending time in New York need something deeper, a guide that explores the real New York in no uncertain terms. Enter <i>The Truth About New York</i>.  </p><p><i>The Truth About New York </i>aims to enlighten those who haven’t been to New York, just as much as it seeks to enhance the understanding of <i>real</i> New York for those who are already here.  And because the <i>vacation-get-away</i> New York will always be a fantastic endeavor, <i>The Truth About New York </i>also serves as a powerful supplement to travel guides for those who just want to visit New York as well as those who like to come to New York periodically.</p><p> </p><h3>WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK SO AMAZING?</h3><p>A few things: </p><p><strong>IF YOU LOVE NEW YORK:</strong></p><ul><li>YOU’RE GONNA LOVE NEW YORK EVEN MORE.  If you ever wondered what makes New York tick, why there’s an endless number of cultural institutions and venues, how there’s more than <i>800</i> languages spoken here and why we all still understand each other, why you can come to New York with nothing and still make something big, you will thoroughly understand everything once you read <i>The Truth About New York</i>.</li></ul><p><strong>IF YOU HATE NEW YORK:</strong></p><ul><li>YOU WON'T HATE NEW YORK ANYMORE. Honest!  But you might be more terrified of New York than ever before.  Or you may be inspired, more than ever before, to pick up everything you own — a vicious wit and charm, two cats, a Honda scooter, an art history degree, an old iPod, a silver spoon — and move to New York immediately.</li></ul><p><strong>IF YOU WANT ALL THE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT NEW YORK FINALLY ANSWERED:</strong></p><p>ALL OF YOUR BIG QUESTIONS WILL FINALLY BE ANSWERED, like:</p><ul>
<li>“What’s the deal with New Yorkers?” (<i style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We think we’re the best… Read the book!</i><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>)</span>
</li>
<li>“Where can I find a nice, spacious, affordable apartment in New York?” (<i>There’s no such thing in New York… Read the book!)</i>
</li>
<li>“What is the dating scene like in New York?” (<i>Consider yourself warned… Read the book!</i>)</li>
<li>“How do New Yorkers have so much free time to do so much?” (<i>Nobody has free time in this town… Read the book!</i>)</li>
<li>“Is Brooklyn really the way it’s portrayed in the television show 'Girls'? (<i>No! But in North Brooklyn, it’s, well, complicated… Read the book.</i>)</li>
<li>“Was pizza really invented in New York?”(Sure s<i>eems that way… Read the book!)</i>

Telling the real story of New York — offering an account that’s more inclusive, accurate and accessible than what you usually find in travel guides or academic cultural studies — has never been more important than it is today.  The United States is the world’s largest economy, ahead of China, Germany, Japan, the UK, and France; and New York is the biggest driving force within America’s economic picture. In fact, not only is New York the largest economy in America, it’s the world’s most economically powerful city.  New York is also deeply influential in the arts and entertainment industries, as well as other industries that help shape and define culture.  Finally, in a world where tolerance and multiculturalism has recently come under serious threat, New York remains as a beacon for the broad scope of the human experience.  So it's no wonder then that millions of people gravitate to New York every year.But New York is a very complex city.  While it is certainly a place full opportunity and excitement, it is also a place that can be quite unforgiving, especially to those who are unfamiliar to its unique flow and general character.  This is why before you move to New York, you should know what you’re really getting into.  And if you’re already living in New York, but haven’t quite figured things out yet or would like to expand your understanding of this town, then there are a number of things you need to know if you plan on extending your stay or if you simply want to get more out of the time that you still have left here.Typical travel guides won’t really help you in this regard, as they tend to focus primarily on “what to do” lists, chasing down a fun time and that sort of thing. Instead, people who are interested in living or spending time in New York need something deeper, a guide that explores the real New York in no uncertain terms. Enter The Truth About New York.  The Truth About New York aims to enlighten those who haven’t been to New York, just as much as it seeks to enhance the understanding of real New York for those who are already here.  And because the vacation-get-away New York will always be a fantastic endeavor, The Truth About New York also serves as a powerful supplement to travel guides for those who just want to visit New York as well as those who like to come to New York periodically. WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK SO AMAZING?A few things: IF YOU LOVE NEW YORK:YOU’RE GONNA LOVE NEW YORK EVEN MORE.  If you ever wondered what makes New York tick, why there’s an endless number of cultural institutions and venues, how there’s more than 800 languages spoken here and why we all still understand each other, why you can come to New York with nothing and still make something big, you will thoroughly understand everything once you read The Truth About New York.IF YOU HATE NEW YORK:YOU WON'T HATE NEW YORK ANYMORE. Honest!  But you might be more terrified of New York than ever before.  Or you may be inspired, more than ever before, to pick up everything you own — a vicious wit and charm, two cats, a Honda scooter, an art history degree, an old iPod, a silver spoon — and move to New York immediately.IF YOU WANT ALL THE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT NEW YORK FINALLY ANSWERED:ALL OF YOUR BIG QUESTIONS WILL FINALLY BE ANSWERED, like:
“What’s the deal with New Yorkers?” (We think we’re the best… Read the book!)

“Where can I find a nice, spacious, affordable apartment in New York?” (There’s no such thing in New York… Read the book!)

“What is the dating scene like in New York?” (Consider yourself warned… Read the book!)
“How do New Yorkers have so much free time to do so much?” (Nobody has free time in this town… Read the book!)
“Is Brooklyn really the way it’s portrayed in the television show 'Girls'? (No! But in North Brooklyn, it’s, well, complicated… Read the book.)
“Was pizza really invented in New York?”(Sure seems that way… Read the book!)

“Was the movie Fame really based on an actual high school in New York?”(O.K., so maybe you didn’t want to know the answer to that question, but isn’t it cool to know that a high school in New York spawned a movie AND a television spin off?)
IF YOU LOVE TO LEARN ABOUT THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE: YOU’RE GOING TO LOVE THE NATURE OF THIS BOOK.  New York is open and liberal by nature, but this narrative contains many twists and turns.  The Truth About New York includes hard truths about socio-economics, work, race, ethnicity, housing, gender, the arts, friendship, dating, sex, the New York mentality, and more.  No topic is taboo, no punches are held, and everything is covered straight up, no chaser.  And The Truth About New York is far more inclusive and culturally informative than any other book you’ll ever read about life in contemporary New York.IF YOU LIKE GOOD WRITING:THIS BOOK IS EXTRA EXCELLENT LITERATURE.  Honest!  It will challenge you.  It will make you laugh.  It will make you cry.  It will make you think.  It will shatter your notions of New York.  It will bolster your notions of New York.  It will enlighten you.  It will entertain you (my accountant even says so).  It will equip you with the sort of knowledge and banter material that will make you the star attraction at any rooftop party, cocktail party, backyard party, post-symposium meet-and-greet, or dive-bar date.  And it’s all very accessible, no tricky dance moves required. TABLE OF CONTENTSPREFACEINTRODUCTIONPART 1: THE LAY OF THE LAND1 THE BASICSDemographic Snapshot, Economy, Work, Health, Safety, and Weather 2 NEW YORK, DAY-TO-DAYThe New York Grind, Housing, Transportation, Consumer Habits, Language, and General CustomsPART 2: NEW YORK SOCIETY3 THE SOCIAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL BACKDROP OF NEW YORK, PART 1The American Education System and Education in New York, Money & Status, Religion, Political Views, Law, and Police4 THE SOCIAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL BACKDROP OF NEW YORK, PART 2Race, Ethnicity, Class, and Privilege5 THE PARADOX OF NEW YORK’S DIVERSITY & MULTICULTURALISMThe Big Non-Melting Pot and New York’s Most Valuable Asset6 THE NEW YORK MENTALITYThe Mind Frame You Need, The Recent Roots of the New York Mentality and the American Way, and the Main Ingredients of the New York MentalityPART 3: CULTURE7 ARTS AND CULTURE IN NEW YORK8 NIGHTLIFE9 STYLE AND FASHION10 FOOD & DRINKINGPART 4: SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS11 FRIENDSHIP IN NEW YORK12 DATING IN NEW YORK13 SEX IN NEW YORKPART 5: INTERVIEWS14 INTERVIEWSAFTERWORDAPPENDIXACKNOWLEDGEMENTS455 pages, trim size: 6x9 WHAT'S THE MONEY GOING TOWARDS? PRODUCTION, PRINTNG, MARKETING, PODCAST AND FILM.The Truth About New York was published by my company, Superchamp Books, and made available in limited quantities almost a year ago.  I made this move as a business decision to break deeper into a publishing market that now makes it more possible for independent publishers to compete.  I was astonished when I learned that the Village Voice had selected The Truth About New York as one of its 2016 “Village Voice Gift Guide” books and dubbed it “the ultimate guide to New York City;” and I was equally grateful when Emily J.

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>15% of the proceeds of book perks will be donated to Milenio.org, a Latinx advocacy organization that promotes the importance of political engagement within the Latinx community. The remainder of the goal funding will go towards producing the books and perks, and sustaining the Project through new gear, transport and outreach costs. The goal of$3000 will allow us to print and ship around 150 books, including 10 complimentary copies to local nonprofit organizations. Even if we don't hit our goal, we plan to donate 15% of the book proceeds and print as many books as we can.</p>
<p>Through partnership with local activists, we are able to offer one-of-a-kind perks, including protest signs actually used in historic marches like the Women's March on Portland and the March for Science PDX. Each book backed through Indiegogo will be signed by the author and hand-wrapped with care in the text of inspirational speeches, quotes and tweets. We can also offer limited edition postcards and posters as perks for you, our first supporters.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The history of the Pacific Northwest is punctuated by larger-than-life figures who fought for what they believed in, and today is no exception. The Northwest Resistance Photography Project stands with the organizers, pulling all-nighters filling Twitter feeds with calls to action. We stand with the leaders, who can imagine a better world and know how to get us there. We stand with you, when you stand for what you believe in.</p>
<p>This book will show the region and the world how diverse and strong our progressive movements are, and highlight our local leaders whose voices lift and unite us, even in our darkest moments.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We have designed this book project to scale, so even if we fall short of our goal, we will still be able to produce the books ordered. Our research indicates there is demand for this book, and that it's unique in this market. Partnering with Milenio.org allows us to maximize our audience and find potential new backers, minimizing risk that the project may not reach its goal.</p>

<p>I have a BS in Behavioral Science and English. I was lucky enough to have the privilege of teaching children on the Autism Spectrum while I was pregnant with my first child. I attribute how high functioning my son became to implementing the Applied Behavioral Analysis skills we learned together while he was in utero.  </p>
<p>We lived in a state with limited medical care, and one pediatric pulmonology practice. After my son had ""end-stage signs"" of pneumonia and was hospitalized at 18 months, he became a patient there. He was diagnosed with asthma, and put on a daily maintenance medication. We would later read in his medical records that the doctor noted its benefit to his adenoids, which he had removed before ever meeting the pulmonologist (knowledge of this was previously noted, but apparently forgotten). From age 2-5 my son met the criteria for High Functioning Autism, which wouldn't be properly diagnosed until he received neurological treatment from another state. He developed an allergic reaction to this medication, and became a different boy over night when it stopped. A pharmaceutical genetics doctor later coined what happened as ""Transient Autism"". When he had his first ""happy day"", his smile quickly turned to shame, as he was cognoscente of the aggression he'd displayed over the years. I immediately refused to let my little boy feel guilt for something he'd had no control over. I promptly promised him that I would turn his story into something he could be proud of, his own book. His smile returned, and I started writing...</p>
<p>Over 45,000 words later, and approaching my son's 6th birthday, there are only a few chapters left before I'm ready to spread his message. Contributions will help move his story to completion by the New Year. My son stopped his medication January 2, 2017 and on the anniversary of this date, I hope to have kept my promise to him. He smiles now, but he didn't always. If he knew that his struggle meaningfully inspired others, then I believe any shame he once felt would dissipate into pride.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have moved our children across the country. Here my son can have better access to medical care and a shorter viral season in order to avoid long term courses of low dose antibiotics. The move significantly reduced our savings. We need about $3,000 to help offset our costs over the course of three months. This will be enough time to complete my son's story and develop his book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contributors will receive a free electronic copy of the book. They will also receive an invitation to join a support network that will be created, where our son's reader's can receive ongoing updates and share their thoughts and experiences with him.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If our goal isn't reached, we will still finish writing, but may not be finished by the target date. Any additional funding received goes towards our son's newfound experiences in a world that he finally feels a part of. These will also be shared on his support network. With his anxiety gone, he is constantly trying to make up for lost time, because he says, ""if you believe in anything, you can do anything"".</p>

It entails a 16,250-mile journey from Ushuaia, Argentina all the way to Caracas, Venezuela, with stops in selected towns and cities of Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. The goal is to discover unpublished and published poets, record them and publish a series of contemporary Latin American anthologies, thus fulfilling a specific and meaningful contribution to contemporary literature. Ushuaia, Tierra del fuego, Argentina La antologíaDespués de 4 años y medio de viaje, el Proyecto iniciará su serie de publicaciones por países y regiones de Latinoamérica. Nuestra primera antología: “Breve tratado del viento Sur - Antología poética de la Patagonia argentina”, reúne la voz de más de ochenta (80) poetas inéditos y publicados.La poesía de la Patagonia argentina está llena de aullidos del viento, grandes extensiones, estepas y horizontes abiertos. Es una poesía introspectiva marcada por un fuerte sentimiento de soledad, lejanía y aislamiento, con temáticas sociales como la pobreza y el hambre.Esta antología es la materialización de la búsqueda que se viene desarrollando. Reúne la poética de una región y muestra el trabajo de poetas que merecen ser conocidos y leídos más allá de sus fronteras. Hablan de un tiempo y un lugar que merecen ser guardados en nuestra memoria. The AnthologyAfter the four and a half year trip, the project will begin its series of publications classifying each according to the country and region in Latin America.  The first one, “Short Treatise of the South Wind – Poetic Anthology of the Argentinian Patagonia”, collects the work of more than eighty (80) published and unpublished poets.Argentinian Patagonian poetry brims with the howling of the wind, the images of widespread areas and open horizons. It´s an introspective poetry marked by a strong sense of loneliness, remoteness, and isolation, treating social themes such as poverty and hunger.This anthology shows the completion of the search being developed.  It brings together the poetry of a region and shows the works of poets that deserve to be known and read beyond their borders. They speak of a given time and place that deserve to be stored in our memory. Nicolás Romano y Eduardo Bechara, Ushuaia, Tierra del fuego, Argentina Estrecho de Magallanes / Strait of Magellan LA CIUDAD SIEMPRE LA CIUDAD Los pájaros vuelan otra vez sobre la ciudad heladalos meses y las semanas pasan veloces y crueles.Ni los viejos resplandores asoman ya.¿Hubo gloria antes de la decadencia?¿Las aguas son las mismas aguas?Aquí todos los santos días se escribe una gran historiade miseria y vodevil.  THE CITY ALWAYS THE CITY The birds fly again over the frozen citymonths and weeks go by fast and cruel.Not even the old shinings glow now.Was there any glory before decadence?Are the waters the same waters?Here all the holly days a great story of misery and vaudevilleis writen. ANAHÍ LAZZARONI Anahí Lazzaroni en su casa / at her home / Ushuaia, Tierra del fuego Los autoresLos más de ochenta (80) poetas incluidos son de diversas edades. Cada uno tiene sus temas afines de acuerdo a sus propias vivencias. Están conscientes de su entorno, de las injusticias que ocurren y de las situaciones que podrían ser mejores. Como lo dijo Eduardo Bechara: “El poeta acepta el desafío de vencer/ la injusticia con belleza,/ de encontrar lo que duele/ y mirarlo de frente,/ o lo que a veces no termina/ de entender”. Maritza Kuzanovic en su oficina / in her office / Rio Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Patagonia The authorsThe eighty (80) or more poets vary in age.  Each one has his/her own theme depending on his/her own experience. They are aware of their environment, the injustices that take place, and the situations that could be better. As Eduardo Bechara said: “The poet accepts the challenge to defeat/ injustice with beauty, / to find what hurts/ and look at it in its eyes/ or what some times can´t be fully/ understood. Con / with Julio ""Mochi"" Leite, Alejandro Pinto & Fredy Gallardo, Río Grande, Tierra del fuego  La editorial Escarabajo editorial fue fundada en Colombia en el año 2006 con el objetivo de promover y publicar nuevos talentos literarios.

Es importante documentar sus cambios, darle espacio a las nuevas voces y escribir la historia de todos como continente. La poesía debe dar cuenta de las circunstancias actuales, debe dialogar con nosotros y con lo que sentimos de forma directa. Al reunir todas estas voces se cuenta la historia de la región.Esta primera antología materializa lo que nos propusimos desde un principio: fomentar la lectura de la poesía latinoamericana contemporánea, unificar al continente en torno a ella, y hacer visibles a poetas que deben ser tenidos en cuenta y reconocidos. ImpactWhy is this project important? What makes it unique?Latin American poetry is alive, it changes and is renewed constantly. It´s important to record its changes, make space to new voices, and write our history as a continent.  Poetry must shed light on current circumstances, chat directly with us and our feelings. The gathering of all these voices tells the history of the region.This first anthology is the culmination of what had been planned from the beginning: promote the reading of Latin American contemporary poetry, unite the continent around it, and make poets, who should be noticed and recognized, visible. Graciela Cros en su casa / at her home / Bariloche, Río Negro Tierra del fuego Otras formas de ayudarSi te resulta difícil ayudarnos con una contribución económica, existen otras formas de ayudar.

And kids base their aspirations on what they know and are exposed to. However, our culture and media hasn't done the greatest job at exposing kids to positive and diverse role models. And often times children are exposed to negative and confusing images at a young age, impacting their idea of a positive and diverse role model</p><p>In fact, studies show that stereotypes negatively impact girls as young as five years old, which affects their lifelong ambitions. It’s also around this time that kids begin to develop their self-esteem. And while boys and girls report similar levels of self-esteem at age five, its young’s girls self-esteem that plummets by age 12.</p><p>In addition to the negative messages girls receive that impact their self-worth, women’s contributions and successes aren't often recognized and celebrated. And since women's contributions aren't mainstream, stereotypes are created. Such stereotypes are found everywhere in our culture and children’s stories are no exception.</p><p><strong>Only 10% best selling picture books features a lead female and only 14% of children’s books show people of color.</strong></p><p><strong>This has to change.</strong></p><p>Our girls deserve better and need sources of inspiration so that they can see and do something they didn’t dare dream was possible. Because if girls don’t see a culture that highlights and champions bold + mighty women, it becomes harder for girls to dream big and be bold + mighty. <strong>Now more than ever</strong>, it’s important to send the message of kindness, acceptance, and equality to our youth. And for those reasons...</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> Adventures with Luna and Friends was created!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505666727/xz3rye5s0cgetoza64qa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505666487/ibgkqjehretwxligydhe.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505666462/hpfmae3tbvaw8dddnbay.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505666525/mwdwuxtjvk9vnezjuc6y.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>The Mission</h3><p>Adventures with Luna &amp; Friends aims to spark the next generation of changemakers. We do this by creating educational content that empowers young girls to be bold +  mighty <b>and</b> bring boys as allies.</p><p>Because we can’t leave our young boys out of the picture! It’s not only girls that need a source of inspiration to be bold + mighty. It’s just as important that young boys be part of a culture where they see women and young girls portrayed as powerful and fearless leaders. And for all  boys and girls to see themselves reflected in our media. We want to model what strength and leadership looks like for kids in Preschool-1st Grade.</p><p>The idea of Adventures with Luna &amp; Friends first came to me a few years ago, when the following thought crossed my mind -- ""why don't we have more books and games that empower girls and in a way that's fun for both kids and parents?"" And since kids love to color, I also thought, ""what if coloring books could help send a message of kindness, acceptance, and inclusion?""</p><p>So in December 2016, we launched our first educational tool, the A-Z coloring book, “Color with Luna.” The coloring book is a creative learning tool that builds a girl’s self-esteem through the power of images and words. Throughout the coloring book, girls are described as Confident, Leaders, and Mighty. Equally important, the coloring book is inclusive as it celebrates kids off all abilities, ethnicities, and cultures. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505666662/ygfd7q8suiunykhha7eg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505666890/fpeydjbdfrq11vwhtu4l.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Who is Luna and Friends?</h3><p>Luna is a young girl who is intelligent, brave, and curious.

And kids base their aspirations on what they know and are exposed to. However, our culture and media hasn't done the greatest job at exposing kids to positive and diverse role models. And often times children are exposed to negative and confusing images at a young age, impacting their idea of a positive and diverse role modelIn fact, studies show that stereotypes negatively impact girls as young as five years old, which affects their lifelong ambitions. It’s also around this time that kids begin to develop their self-esteem. And while boys and girls report similar levels of self-esteem at age five, its young’s girls self-esteem that plummets by age 12.In addition to the negative messages girls receive that impact their self-worth, women’s contributions and successes aren't often recognized and celebrated. And since women's contributions aren't mainstream, stereotypes are created. Such stereotypes are found everywhere in our culture and children’s stories are no exception.Only 10% best selling picture books features a lead female and only 14% of children’s books show people of color.This has to change.Our girls deserve better and need sources of inspiration so that they can see and do something they didn’t dare dream was possible. Because if girls don’t see a culture that highlights and champions bold + mighty women, it becomes harder for girls to dream big and be bold + mighty. Now more than ever, it’s important to send the message of kindness, acceptance, and equality to our youth. And for those reasons... Adventures with Luna and Friends was created! The MissionAdventures with Luna & Friends aims to spark the next generation of changemakers. We do this by creating educational content that empowers young girls to be bold +  mighty and bring boys as allies.Because we can’t leave our young boys out of the picture! It’s not only girls that need a source of inspiration to be bold + mighty. It’s just as important that young boys be part of a culture where they see women and young girls portrayed as powerful and fearless leaders. And for all  boys and girls to see themselves reflected in our media. We want to model what strength and leadership looks like for kids in Preschool-1st Grade.The idea of Adventures with Luna & Friends first came to me a few years ago, when the following thought crossed my mind -- ""why don't we have more books and games that empower girls and in a way that's fun for both kids and parents?"" And since kids love to color, I also thought, ""what if coloring books could help send a message of kindness, acceptance, and inclusion?""So in December 2016, we launched our first educational tool, the A-Z coloring book, “Color with Luna.” The coloring book is a creative learning tool that builds a girl’s self-esteem through the power of images and words. Throughout the coloring book, girls are described as Confident, Leaders, and Mighty. Equally important, the coloring book is inclusive as it celebrates kids off all abilities, ethnicities, and cultures. Who is Luna and Friends?Luna is a young girl who is intelligent, brave, and curious. She takes you on adventures while introducing you to her friends along the way. Luna's friends are unique and celebrate their strengths. And they celebrate their friendship by supporting and learning from each other.#BoldandMightyKidsSince launching our first coloring book, Adventures with Luna & Friends has put on several events for kids throughout the DC Metro community.

<h3>What is The Mindset Triangle?</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Stu and a 37 year old Personal Trainer from Birmingham. I have been living with depression and anxiety for most of my adult life, but always hid under the stigma blanket. Once diagnosed about 7 years ago and accepting it, I started to live alongside it. This is when The Mindset Triangle was born. For me to stay on a level and minimizing the time I spend in the dark side, I live my life by this triangle. If you can remember back to your schools day when you were taught the fire triangle you will know that for the fire to burn you need 3 elements Oxygen, Heat and Fuel. Well its the same process with The Mindset Triangle but for me to function I need Healthy Eating, Sleep and Exercise. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507566486/s8wyf4rneyendl1gymhr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This campaign is to share the knowledge and help people live their life by the triangle and reduce the stigma of mental health in the UK. Myself and Henriette, a photographer from Birmingham who's Dad lives with depression, have collaborated to write a book to demonstrate how easy it is to live a healthier lifestyle to give you a healthier mindset. This book will be full of healthy recipes to easy 20 min workouts and tips and tricks that I use to deal with every day life. We have also interviewed people who live with mental health and talked to them about what they do to balance themselves in a day to day life. </p>
<p><strong>We're on a mission to reach as many people as possible. By you pledging your support and sharing our campaign, it will help The Mindset Triangle to share this formula nationwide; reducing the stigma associated with mental health and giving people the guidance to really improve their lifestyle and mind.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In this campaign we are looking to raise £10,000. This money will be split to publish and print the book and market it so we can touch as many people in the U.K as possible as follows ; £3500 to publish, £4000 first print run, £1500 Marketing and advertising and £1000 to run workshops through the uk. </p>
<p>We have some very exciting pledges for you to put your hands on and the support does not stop with just the book. For every pledge that is bought you will receive a signed copy of the book. You will also be enrolled onto the online members area where the support will continue with workouts and recipes. We have teamed up with charities across the UK so you will be able to pledge and we can donate these books to a mental health charity of your choice.  These charities can distribute The Mindset Triangle book to their service users. Or maybe you need a kickstart so why not spend the day with Stu. Shopping, cooking and having a workout to put you in the right mindset to hit that triangle.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507570430/qmzifmxj7klqycwmpjpm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>
<br/>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The impact could be huge and we want to make this as big as we can. 12 men a day take their own life in the UK. For every 1 completed suicide another 20 attempted suicides. These numbers need to come down and for that to happen we need to remove the stigma blanket that is suffocating many men living with mental health in the UK. This can be done by making a community of like minded people sharing cooking ideas or working out together and being there as a support for each other. It is OK not to be OK and talking about it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Please show your support by becoming a pledger to 'The Mindset Triangle' campaign, Every donation: no matter how big or small, goes a long way to help. You can also do your bit by sharing the campaign on social media, passing it on to friends and of course tweeting us your <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23TagTheTriangle&amp;src=typd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#TagTheTriangle</a> picture.</strong></p>

<h3><u>Stu's Story</u></h3>
<p><i>""I have suffered with depression and anxiety for many years now. I'm not sure when it started, maybe I have always had it but it has been masked by other factors.  One thing for sure - It got worse as I have got older, when stress levels are raised by having more responsibilities. You may be asking what's the point in me shouting out? It's because for years I have been hiding behind bravado because of the stigma that is Mental Illness. The MALE PRIDE trying not to show weakness as a man, be the man of the house that is expected of a father or husband. I want to let other people know that it is okay to be depressed and to talk about it to lighten the load.  It's not just a matter of cheering up. The phrase  ""You just need to cheer up"" still rings around my head after it took weeks for the wife to convince me I needed to see a doctor and for me to sit there and dig deep pushing the male pride aside and relay the feelings I have had, still have and the dark moments; for him to take a deep breath look me in the eyes and say "" you just need to cheer up "" hit me like a bull hits a red flag.</i></p>
<p><i>Its been a fair few years since that doctor and now I can feel the feelings and counteract them with positive stuff. Exercise and pushing my mind and body in different challenges is my way. There are 2 reasons for this.  1 being that the body releases the natural chemical endorphins when you exercise which gives you a buzz of importance and happiness.   The 2nd would be the commitment of a challenge and raising money for a charity keeps me focused and if you can get a world record like we did in 2011 even better.</i></p>
<p><i>When I have a low day the best way for me to destress is to get on my bike. Only a cyclist knows how a dog feels with its head out of a moving car. The wind in your face, endorphins rushing around your body creating positive thoughts, the wonderful view of the countryside on a summers morning and the coffee and lump of cake you will inhale half way through your cycle is a great feeling.</i></p>
<p><i>Where is the dark side? you may ask. It's the place you go to when depression gets you by the short and curlies. There's nowhere like it. It has a gravitational pull where the duvet on your bed weighs about 20 stone and you just have no motivation to do anything apart from beating yourself up and finding every negative thought you have in the grey matter upstairs.</i></p>
<p><i>Whenever I have been there I can never put my finger on why I have the thoughts. I look back at what I was like a few years, back before diagnosis and to be honest it's amazing that I have come out of the other side. Self harm and suicidal thoughts were a constant battle and happened quite regularly and I couldn't understand why. Always on the search for someone or something to blame but could never find the answer.</i></p>
<p><i>I am completely different now and that has all came down to acceptance that "" I'm not wired up right"" and that taking the tablets isn't such a big deal. Believe me though when I first got the tablets I hated taking them and didn't think they did anything - until I'd forget to take them for a couple of days and really notice my mood change. In laymen's terms my brain doesn't make enough of the right chemical and the tablets replace this. Simples. Don't get me wrong I didn't get a prescription for the drugs straight away I was completely against it. I first went on a psychodynamic therapy course of 12 weeks at the doctors, which worked great to put a lot of things to bed from the past when I was a kid.</i></p>
<p><i>What I am trying to say is you have to make the first step. I'm lucky to have an amazing people around me that could see that I wasn't happy even though when asked the generic answer is "" I'm Fine"". Don't be scared to get help or ask for advice. I punished myself for years. All jazzyhands and smiley stu outside and then a mess when in my own company.</i></p>
<p><i>Dig deep, kick that duvet off the bed stick on some trainers and walk round the block. Set a positive goal for something in the future that is achievable.""</i></p>

Once diagnosed about 7 years ago and accepting it, I started to live alongside it. This is when The Mindset Triangle was born. For me to stay on a level and minimizing the time I spend in the dark side, I live my life by this triangle. If you can remember back to your schools day when you were taught the fire triangle you will know that for the fire to burn you need 3 elements Oxygen, Heat and Fuel. Well its the same process with The Mindset Triangle but for me to function I need Healthy Eating, Sleep and Exercise. 

This campaign is to share the knowledge and help people live their life by the triangle and reduce the stigma of mental health in the UK. Myself and Henriette, a photographer from Birmingham who's Dad lives with depression, have collaborated to write a book to demonstrate how easy it is to live a healthier lifestyle to give you a healthier mindset. This book will be full of healthy recipes to easy 20 min workouts and tips and tricks that I use to deal with every day life. We have also interviewed people who live with mental health and talked to them about what they do to balance themselves in a day to day life. 
We're on a mission to reach as many people as possible. By you pledging your support and sharing our campaign, it will help The Mindset Triangle to share this formula nationwide; reducing the stigma associated with mental health and giving people the guidance to really improve their lifestyle and mind.
 

What We Need & What You Get
In this campaign we are looking to raise £10,000. This money will be split to publish and print the book and market it so we can touch as many people in the U.K as possible as follows ; £3500 to publish, £4000 first print run, £1500 Marketing and advertising and £1000 to run workshops through the uk. 
We have some very exciting pledges for you to put your hands on and the support does not stop with just the book. For every pledge that is bought you will receive a signed copy of the book. You will also be enrolled onto the online members area where the support will continue with workouts and recipes. We have teamed up with charities across the UK so you will be able to pledge and we can donate these books to a mental health charity of your choice.  These charities can distribute The Mindset Triangle book to their service users. Or maybe you need a kickstart so why not spend the day with Stu. Shopping, cooking and having a workout to put you in the right mindset to hit that triangle.


The Impact

The impact could be huge and we want to make this as big as we can. 12 men a day take their own life in the UK. For every 1 completed suicide another 20 attempted suicides. These numbers need to come down and for that to happen we need to remove the stigma blanket that is suffocating many men living with mental health in the UK. This can be done by making a community of like minded people sharing cooking ideas or working out together and being there as a support for each other. It is OK not to be OK and talking about it helps.
Please show your support by becoming a pledger to 'The Mindset Triangle' campaign, Every donation: no matter how big or small, goes a long way to help. You can also do your bit by sharing the campaign on social media, passing it on to friends and of course tweeting us your #TagTheTriangle picture.
We really appreciate your help, and welcome you to become part of this exciting journey...
 
Stu's Story
""I have suffered with depression and anxiety for many years now. I'm not sure when it started, maybe I have always had it but it has been masked by other factors.  One thing for sure - It got worse as I have got older, when stress levels are raised by having more responsibilities. You may be asking what's the point in me shouting out? It's because for years I have been hiding behind bravado because of the stigma that is Mental Illness. The MALE PRIDE trying not to show weakness as a man, be the man of the house that is expected of a father or husband. I want to let other people know that it is okay to be depressed and to talk about it to lighten the load.  It's not just a matter of cheering up. The phrase  ""You just need to cheer up"" still rings around my head after it took weeks for the wife to convince me I needed to see a doctor and for me to sit there and dig deep pushing the male pride aside and relay the feelings I have had, still have and the dark moments; for him to take a deep breath look me in the eyes and say "" you just need to cheer up "" hit me like a bull hits a red flag.
Its been a fair few years since that doctor and now I can feel the feelings and counteract them with positive stuff. Exercise and pushing my mind and body in different challenges is my way. There are 2 reasons for this.  1 being that the body releases the natural chemical endorphins when you exercise which gives you a buzz of importance and happiness.   The 2nd would be the commitment of a challenge and raising money for a charity keeps me focused and if you can get a world record like we did in 2011 even better.
When I have a low day the best way for me to destress is to get on my bike. Only a cyclist knows how a dog feels with its head out of a moving car. The wind in your face, endorphins rushing around your body creating positive thoughts, the wonderful view of the countryside on a summers morning and the coffee and lump of cake you will inhale half way through your cycle is a great feeling.
Where is the dark side? you may ask. It's the place you go to when depression gets you by the short and curlies. There's nowhere like it. It has a gravitational pull where the duvet on your bed weighs about 20 stone and you just have no motivation to do anything apart from beating yourself up and finding every negative thought you have in the grey matter upstairs.
Whenever I have been there I can never put my finger on why I have the thoughts. I look back at what I was like a few years, back before diagnosis and to be honest it's amazing that I have come out of the other side. Self harm and suicidal thoughts were a constant battle and happened quite regularly and I couldn't understand why. Always on the search for someone or something to blame but could never find the answer.
I am completely different now and that has all came down to acceptance that "" I'm not wired up right"" and that taking the tablets isn't such a big deal. Believe me though when I first got the tablets I hated taking them and didn't think they did anything - until I'd forget to take them for a couple of days and really notice my mood change. In laymen's terms my brain doesn't make enough of the right chemical and the tablets replace this. Simples. Don't get me wrong I didn't get a prescription for the drugs straight away I was completely against it. I first went on a psychodynamic therapy course of 12 weeks at the doctors, which worked great to put a lot of things to bed from the past when I was a kid.
What I am trying to say is you have to make the first step. I'm lucky to have an amazing people around me that could see that I wasn't happy even though when asked the generic answer is "" I'm Fine"". Don't be scared to get help or ask for advice. I punished myself for years. All jazzyhands and smiley stu outside and then a mess when in my own company.
Dig deep, kick that duvet off the bed stick on some trainers and walk round the block. Set a positive goal for something in the future that is achievable.""",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Heart of Light is a fantasy steampunk illustrated novel.</b></p>
<p>The story begins a thousand years ago in the Drachnian kingdom during the first iron war, when Iroh (known in his time as The Iron King) created 9 powerful war machines called ""The Nine Gods"" woven with the souls of his Nine Drachnian Warlords in hopes to finally stop the dreaded war.</p>
<p>Outmatched in the battlefield the nine mechanical gods eventually ended the Iron war.</p>
<p>But in the night before the gathering of the Nine Nations in Galderos to discuss peaceful solutions in the Drachnian Kingdom. The nine gods began killing everyone they have all sworn to protect - and no one knows why. Betrayed and wounded Iroh used an ancient artifact known as the ""Moonstone"" to trap the human souls of the nine gods inside the stone. </p>
<p>Then as the last soul was sealed inside the Moonstone the light flickered and the Moonstone . . . vanished. Leaving the Iron King lifeless.</p>
<p>Years, decades, a millennium had long past since that historical night. Rumors became myth; myth became legend. For more than a thousand years the location of the Moonstone that holds their nine souls remained . . .unknown.<span><br/></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Untill . . . A faint sound of a heartbeat.</p>
<b>THE IRON LAW</b><br/><span><br/></span>In the mechanical world of Galderos, soul mechanicks like Mika have skills that combine animal souls into machines. <p></p>
<p>Known as ""Soul Weaving"", with gloves of metal and light. A soul mechanick weaves the threads of life into the iron core of the machine. Forging war machines, vehicles or gadgets that help their masters do their bidding. But with such a dangerous skill, there is a strict code to obey. An ancient law that forbids mechanicks of all rank from disturbing the balance between life and nature. Known in the council of mechanicks as ""The Iron Law"". This sacred law was created a thousand years ago after the entrapment of the Nine Gods, to prevent history from repeating itself.</p>
<p><br/><b>The Five Iron Law:</b><br/>1: You shall honor the souls you weave.<br/>2: You shall never weave the soul of a human being inside a machine.<br/>3: You shall never combine machinery with any human flesh.<br/>4: You shall only weave the souls that have ended their life naturally.<br/>5: You shall depart a soul in peace if it exists in torment.</p>
<b>Summary</b><br/><span><br/></span>That was a sneak peek of what the book holds. I hope you are all thrilled after reading it as much as I was writing it! “Heart of Light” revolves around the story of <i>Michaela Paige Reininger a.k.a Mika,</i> a young soul mechanick who travels around the world of Galderos with her father Gustav, inside their moondust powered vehicle known as ""The Scarab"".<p></p>

<br/><p></p></div>","Heart of Light is a fantasy steampunk illustrated novel.
The story begins a thousand years ago in the Drachnian kingdom during the first iron war, when Iroh (known in his time as The Iron King) created 9 powerful war machines called ""The Nine Gods"" woven with the souls of his Nine Drachnian Warlords in hopes to finally stop the dreaded war.
Outmatched in the battlefield the nine mechanical gods eventually ended the Iron war.
But in the night before the gathering of the Nine Nations in Galderos to discuss peaceful solutions in the Drachnian Kingdom. The nine gods began killing everyone they have all sworn to protect - and no one knows why. Betrayed and wounded Iroh used an ancient artifact known as the ""Moonstone"" to trap the human souls of the nine gods inside the stone. 
Then as the last soul was sealed inside the Moonstone the light flickered and the Moonstone . . . vanished. Leaving the Iron King lifeless.
Years, decades, a millennium had long past since that historical night. Rumors became myth; myth became legend. For more than a thousand years the location of the Moonstone that holds their nine souls remained . . .unknown.

Untill . . . A faint sound of a heartbeat.
THE IRON LAWIn the mechanical world of Galderos, soul mechanicks like Mika have skills that combine animal souls into machines. 
Known as ""Soul Weaving"", with gloves of metal and light. A soul mechanick weaves the threads of life into the iron core of the machine. Forging war machines, vehicles or gadgets that help their masters do their bidding. But with such a dangerous skill, there is a strict code to obey. An ancient law that forbids mechanicks of all rank from disturbing the balance between life and nature. Known in the council of mechanicks as ""The Iron Law"". This sacred law was created a thousand years ago after the entrapment of the Nine Gods, to prevent history from repeating itself.
The Five Iron Law:1: You shall honor the souls you weave.2: You shall never weave the soul of a human being inside a machine.3: You shall never combine machinery with any human flesh.4: You shall only weave the souls that have ended their life naturally.5: You shall depart a soul in peace if it exists in torment.
SummaryThat was a sneak peek of what the book holds. I hope you are all thrilled after reading it as much as I was writing it! “Heart of Light” revolves around the story of Michaela Paige Reininger a.k.a Mika, a young soul mechanick who travels around the world of Galderos with her father Gustav, inside their moondust powered vehicle known as ""The Scarab"".








But when word gets out about the legendary Moonstone being found after being lost for a thousand years, their world is threatened by an impending war and her fate is intertwined with Damien's, a mysterious boy suffering from amnesia. They must go in search for the hidden tombs of the Nine Gods that will help them end the war that could doom all of human kind.



Biography & Purpose  I am an animator and game designer in Hong Kong. In my free time I write short stories poems and novels. An aspiring writer. :) I created this novel to dedicate it to a dear friend of mine who is suffering from a terminal illness. I wish to finish the novel before anything happens to her. I want her to read the world I created for her and I wanted to remember her whenever I or anyone reads the book. I wish to give her immortality as a parting gift. :) “Heart of Light” has a unique storyline and a well-detailed and thought-out world populated by unique characters. By funding this project you may be contributing to a next best seller for all ages to enjoy and hopefully cherish.



Features of the book
Why it is special:
The book contains 1 full page image of each scene in a chapter plus other small spot illustrations that brings the world of Galderos to life.
Characters with interesting backgrounds and mysteries written in the past.

A unique world with laws and systems only found in this book.
As you progress in the story discover the 5 classes of machines that exist in the mechanical world, like the Primadon-class war machines woven with the soul of a land mammal in its iron core - and many more!
Uncover the secrets in the past of who the nine gods were and why they betrayed their oath on that faithful night.
