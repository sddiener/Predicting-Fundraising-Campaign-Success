<p>Las Casas is<b> both a <i>journey</i> and a <i>destination</i></b>...a means <b>and</b> an end. Now we're launching a second initiative, called <b>#BeReconciled</b>. This will help ignite a stronger, more reconciled local community in Indianapolis through art and advocacy.</p>
<p>This campaign is meant to propel us into a full-scale operation to include the following <b><i>business model components</i>:</b><br/><b>1)</b> sales of retail Fair Trade merchandise<br/><b>2)</b> complemented by a restaurant cafe offering Guatemalan food and specialty drinks (coffee, teas, and juices)<br/><b>3)</b> while featuring the #BeReconciled Art Gallery and hosting #BeReconciled Educational Segments to foster community growth</p>

<p></p>
<b><h3>The Journey</h3></b><p>After having lived in Guatemala for a year, we grew passionate and inspired by the Mayan culture and people. We saw the need - lack of education/jobs, malnutrition, and a tragic history of oppression - for fair trade by recognizing that <b>if people matter, then the way we trade matters.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/951741/files/20141022123635-opt_impactcollage2.jpg?1414006595"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Two years ago we invested $4,000 out of pocket to get the fair trade venture underway with inventory. Since then, that out of pocket money has enabled us to restock and reinvest over $25,000 in business development for the artisans in Guatemala.</p>
<p>So for these two initial start-up years we've spent our weekends setting up booths at local art shows, farmer's markets, and festivals to sell the fair trade merchandise on behalf of the artisans in Guatemala. <b>100% of all sales have gone back to Guatemala and attributed to the betterment of the artisans and their communities.</b><br/></p>
<p><b>The need for a store is about sustainability</b>...creating a longevity to our commitment to the artisans in Guatemala for years to come.</p>

<p>Now with #BeReconciled, we get to implement a $5,000 <i></i>Focus2020 Community Action Grant that <b>we received in November 2014</b>. This project strengthens our overall mission <i>to advocate and create sustainable and peaceful communities</i>.

<div>I have over ~20 different models of BalanVino's in my home for sometime, and the people who see them for the first time usually ask the same 3-4 questions:<p></p>
<p>FAQ's:</p>
<p>Q1: ""You made that?                                                                                                                         A1: I designed all of them myself originally but have improved on many with the feedback from my close friends. Thank you!</p>
<p>Q2: How do they Balance?                                                                                                             A2: Without referencing too much physics, the weight of the bottle creates a torque in one direction while the BalanVino sculpture creates a torque in the other direction.</p>
<p>Q3: If you take one bottle of wine out of the<b> RockinVino</b> guitar, will it fall over?          A3: Yes</p>
<p>Q4: How did you come up with that?                                                                                         A4: For the history in further detail See Below...Else the product speaks for and sells it self - <b>Please take the steps necessary right now to order your favorite!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>The BalanVino Story...</b></i></p>
<p>I will try to explain in detail the story of how BalanVino came about as it seems to add clarity to those new to it.</p>
<p>How did you come up with that?  Balancing a bottle of wine in a flat board ""Wine Tilt"" is not a new idea in fact there have been may people who have created similar products for years and years.  The<b> ""Original"" BalanVino</b> design was derived from much trial and error.  A co-worker at the time had a wine tilt in his office that he had just bought, and I told him ""That is no big deal, I'll go home tonight and make one way better than that!"" (As I like a challenge and he didn't believe I could do it.)  I started with a cheap scrap of 2x4 and a plug-in hand drill from the 60's that my Grampa had given me.   The 2x4 was all beat up and I didn't have the right bits or tools to recreate the one I had seen, but I tried anyway. Skipping over a few hours of relearning high school shop skills and swearing at the cheapest table saw known to mankind.  I realized that with the proper tools, I could easily reproduce the wine tilt I had seen and therefore gave up on the reproduction.  I thought to myself, ""How could I make one that looked like it was really going to fall over?  I found my Dad's old ""Saber"" saw/jigsaw and started going to town.  I made over 40-50 prototypes of different shapes and colors, trying to prove to my coworker that I could make a more unique and gravity defying wine bottle holder.</p>
<p>Then I went into the exotic woods, then I bought new woodworking tools, and sanders and sandpaper and lacquers and stains and disc sanders and routers( All which I still have today in my garage.)</p>
<p> I ended up dropping one of the early models, and broke a chunk off, and then developed that one into the <b>Original</b> BalanVino.  I couldn't wait to bring it to work after it was done, as I knew it was beautiful.</p>
<p>I gave away all my prototypes to friends and was going to clean up the sawdust and move on, but a friend of a friend wanted not only one of them, but ordered 5, I think, and offered to pay me for them.  That is when I knew I had something.</p>
<p>I sold a couple hundred of that first model via word of mouth only, and was becoming very passionate about the idea of this becoming a legitimate business!</p>
<p>I figured out the trick on how to make new designs very quickly, and have made many many one of a kind prototypes while pecking away at creating inventory of the Original.  Some ""life circumstances"" happened and the business got put on back burner for a few years.</p>
<p>Several months ago I started making them again in my garage and realized with the help of a couple friends pushing me to start this up again, that there is still a high demand for my original designs and my passion and dream of making this a full time business became a priority again.  I again was blessed with inspiration and creativity and developed a new model that I think may be very popular to a good sized market. Collectors, Art lovers, Wine Lovers and those who can appreciate high heeled shoes! Enter the Elegant and Sexy- StilettoVino.</p>
<div>Everyone has a different favorite so I am offering  multiple choices for those who help me kick-start my business.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Background on the Project</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><p>Site Specific Cameras combines photography and land art. We build large cameras out of materials found in the landscape and then use the cameras to photograph that landscape. If we want to photograph the forest, the camera is likely made of materials such as logs, sticks, leaves and dirt. We always use a found aperture, something with a preexisting tiny, roundish hole.  In this way the physical components of the landscape, feedback into the character of the camera and the final photograph. The cameras are also large enough for one of us to fit into. We act as the mechanical parts of the camera, like the shutter and film advance. We have spent the last few years using this process to catalogue the varied landscapes around the San Francisco Bay Area: redwood forest, oak woodlands, rocky and sandy beaches, and grasslands. We have exhibited the work extensively in the Bay Area but the project has evolved since David moved away from the Bay. Our new approach is to document specific locations via road trips throughout the US. For this journey, we are trying to raise additional money to fund a small documentary film crew to join us and help tell our story.</p><p>We have been working on this project since 2012 and have exhibited the work in places throughout the Bay Area including the Kala Art Institute, The Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History, Rock Paper Scissors Collective, and Rayko Photo Center.<br/></p><br/><p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>This spring we are planning on traveling to the South West to build cameras along the Rio Grande River,  from the western panhandle of Texas through New Mexico and into southern Colorado. W<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">e are trying to raise enough money so that Matthew Brown and Mario Casillas can join us on the journey in order to record our endeavors and create a documentary film. Matthew and Mario are both artists, photographers, and film makers in their own right. Matthew has volunteered to direct the documentary with Mario acting as his sole assistant. Unfortunately, David and I can't afford to pay them for their generous efforts but we are hoping to fund their trip through this campaign so there is no out of pocket expenses for either of them.  </span></p><p>The Rio Grande River follows a course set by a geologic rift that began forming about 35 million years ago.  The rift valley has acted as a conduit for the movement of materials and life for thousands of years and it is fairly analogous to the rift valleys of East Africa. Within the scientific field of paleoanthropology, the most widely accepted hypothesis is that anatomically modern humans originated in East Africa. Both of these rift valleys opened up numerous ecological niches in otherwise broadly homogeneous and harsh landscapes. Humans have had a long history in both rift valleys. Early humans evolved in East Africa and the Rio Grande Valley has acted, and continues to act, as a conduit for humans moving north and south from present day Mexico and the central United States. Our goal is to document these histories and landscapes by directly interacting with environments along the valley.</p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> You're generous contributions will help fund the trip and the money raised will be used for airfare, travel expenses, and the materials we need to make the work. Without your help we won't be able to afford the trip.</span></p><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Adam, Matthew, and Mario currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area and David resides in Houston, Texas. The money will help with airfare so that the trio can meet David in Texas where they will begin their drive west into New Mexico.  Money raised will be used to cover Matthew and Mario's expenses such as airfare, food, lodging and camping fees. It will also be used to purchase some gear they need to make the film such as memory cards, camera batteries, and hard drives to back up footage. Any additional money that is raised will be used by David and Adam to cover some of their own travel expenses and on the photographic materials they need like Fuji FP-100c instant film, direct positive silver gelatin paper, and x-ray film. Our goal is to only use photographic materials that create one of a kind positive processes.</p><p>We will be offering some of these unique prints to the kind people who contribute to our campaign! By contributing you can get a one of a kind print that was created with a camera built from the earth. In addition, you'll have an insider first look at the film Matthew and Mario create! </p><p>

Site Specific Cameras combines photography and land art. We build large cameras out of materials found in the landscape and then use the cameras to photograph that landscape. If we want to photograph the forest, the camera is likely made of materials such as logs, sticks, leaves and dirt. We always use a found aperture, something with a preexisting tiny, roundish hole.  In this way the physical components of the landscape, feedback into the character of the camera and the final photograph. The cameras are also large enough for one of us to fit into. We act as the mechanical parts of the camera, like the shutter and film advance. We have spent the last few years using this process to catalogue the varied landscapes around the San Francisco Bay Area: redwood forest, oak woodlands, rocky and sandy beaches, and grasslands. We have exhibited the work extensively in the Bay Area but the project has evolved since David moved away from the Bay. Our new approach is to document specific locations via road trips throughout the US. For this journey, we are trying to raise additional money to fund a small documentary film crew to join us and help tell our story.We have been working on this project since 2012 and have exhibited the work in places throughout the Bay Area including the Kala Art Institute, The Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History, Rock Paper Scissors Collective, and Rayko Photo Center.Short SummaryThis spring we are planning on traveling to the South West to build cameras along the Rio Grande River,  from the western panhandle of Texas through New Mexico and into southern Colorado. We are trying to raise enough money so that Matthew Brown and Mario Casillas can join us on the journey in order to record our endeavors and create a documentary film. Matthew and Mario are both artists, photographers, and film makers in their own right. Matthew has volunteered to direct the documentary with Mario acting as his sole assistant. Unfortunately, David and I can't afford to pay them for their generous efforts but we are hoping to fund their trip through this campaign so there is no out of pocket expenses for either of them.  The Rio Grande River follows a course set by a geologic rift that began forming about 35 million years ago.  The rift valley has acted as a conduit for the movement of materials and life for thousands of years and it is fairly analogous to the rift valleys of East Africa. Within the scientific field of paleoanthropology, the most widely accepted hypothesis is that anatomically modern humans originated in East Africa. Both of these rift valleys opened up numerous ecological niches in otherwise broadly homogeneous and harsh landscapes. Humans have had a long history in both rift valleys. Early humans evolved in East Africa and the Rio Grande Valley has acted, and continues to act, as a conduit for humans moving north and south from present day Mexico and the central United States. Our goal is to document these histories and landscapes by directly interacting with environments along the valley. You're generous contributions will help fund the trip and the money raised will be used for airfare, travel expenses, and the materials we need to make the work. Without your help we won't be able to afford the trip.What We Need & What You GetAdam, Matthew, and Mario currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area and David resides in Houston, Texas. The money will help with airfare so that the trio can meet David in Texas where they will begin their drive west into New Mexico.  Money raised will be used to cover Matthew and Mario's expenses such as airfare, food, lodging and camping fees. It will also be used to purchase some gear they need to make the film such as memory cards, camera batteries, and hard drives to back up footage. Any additional money that is raised will be used by David and Adam to cover some of their own travel expenses and on the photographic materials they need like Fuji FP-100c instant film, direct positive silver gelatin paper, and x-ray film. Our goal is to only use photographic materials that create one of a kind positive processes.We will be offering some of these unique prints to the kind people who contribute to our campaign! By contributing you can get a one of a kind print that was created with a camera built from the earth. In addition, you'll have an insider first look at the film Matthew and Mario create!

<h3>Methuselah </h3>
<p>Imagine you’re walking on playa at night. The dust is whipping around your face, you take your scarf out to cover your mouth as a storm brews on the horizon. A faint orange light catches your eye in the approaching expanse. A shadow surrounds the light in the distance, a dark structure that houses curiosity within. As you approach, a massive 20 foot steel structure extends toward the sky. The backdrop of billowing dust and chaotic festival lights amplifies the stoic nature of this magnificent creature. What lies before you is, Methuselah.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497216010/egcmbmbalckqjs9ql1fi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Modeled after the oldest living tree in the world, this replica of the ancient 4,848 year old bristlecone pine speaks of ancestry and honor. Your weary feet find reprieve as you take your place amongst the tree’s roots on benches that seem to grow out of the desert ground. The fire which you first saw from so far away burns warmly in the heart of its trunk. Soft illumination reflects off of the large convex mirror nestled at the base of the flame and shines through the stained glass embedded in the bark. The storm dies down as you’re lulled to sleep by the tree’s soft chimes blowing in the wind and the hushed conversations of other travelers.</p>

<p>The sun peeks over the horizon as you stir awake. The world is perfect in this moment of absolute stillness; just the sun, yourself, and this symbol of nature. You can now see the details of the bark, the colored glass, the intricately woven pieces of swirling metal, and the depths of color created by a beautiful patina.  </p>
<p>The stillness dissolves as an aerialist takes position under one of the branches.  You hadn’t noticed before but Methuselah is also an enchanted performance space. She hangs a hoop and you sit mesmerized by this display of raw and passionate talent. As the performance concludes you slowly stand up. Your heart, mind, and soul are filled to the brim with the experiences you have shared with this timeless symbol of strength. You walk forth, replenished and rejuvenated. Methuselah follows in your heart, forever finding a home amongst the iconic spirits and myths who pay homage to the Earth.</p>

<p>This vision, this passion, this story can only be made possible with you, the traveler. Methuselah, is a symbol of resilience, honor, and ancestry that has only been able to stand the test of time with the support of an extensive root system. We now humbly ask you to be our root system; to be like the sun, soil, and rain that brings life to the real Methuselah and allow this installation, erected in her honor, to thrive. Your contributions create the unique opportunity for Majorelle Arts to bring Methuselah to our home, your home, to Burning Man 2017.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Methuselah is the biggest project this crew has ever created. One of the biggest challenges is designing and fabricating a tree that is structurally sound for aerial performance and participant safety.  We are combining the professional expertise of a local engineer with the knowledge and experience of the aerialists and architects on our crew to overcome this paramount task.  We have also enlisted the help of experienced welders who will aid and supervise in the sculpture's construction.  </p>
<p>Further challenges include creating a beautiful patina, complex textures, and a stunning silhouette.  Although we are a highly artistic community with an eye for design few of us have worked so intimately on projects with such large proportions and dimensions.  By simultaneously maintaining processes of design and construction we allow them to inform each other, generating our desired results. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497220872/zoynuwcz39dsobhbwpnz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A final, dreadful challenge is the logistics of making a 3-ton sculpture and transporting it 600 miles. We hope to team up with other local projects to cut some of the transportation costs and have a few dedicated community members taking up the task of supporting and caring for the crew during construction and break down.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know not everyone can donate money to Methuselah but there are lots of ways you can be a part of the Majorelle Arts community.  One of the most integral parts of success for this project is awareness! Telling your friends, family, and colleagues about this project in person is the best way to get people involved. We also encourage everyone to use Indiegogo's ""share"" feature to help spread the word about the Methuselah fundraiser on social media. Liking our Facebook page (Majorelle Arts) is the best way to get updates about whats going on with Methuselah and the team, it is also where we will publicly thank our donors. We invite everyone to stop by on playa and come say hello! You can also contact us with interest in volunteering at our Oakland studio. </p>

<h3>Meet Wahani Puzzles</h3>
<p>This Indigenous-owned small business is born from a passion for Native art and a dream for representation. Wahani Puzzles will provide high-quality jigsaw puzzles featuring art by extraordinary Native artists, an affordable way to spend time with and learn about Native art while also supporting each artist. </p>
<h3>Meet the Founder</h3>
<p>My name is Singer Horse Capture, I am a member of the A'aninin tribe of Northern Montana, and <strong>Wahani means <i>together</i> in A'aniii</strong>. I grew up in Minnesota in a family that deeply values the arts. I am starting a puzzle company to share Native art through a medium that is accessible, shareable, reuse-able, and relaxing while honoring the quality of the art itself. I am excited to provide a fun way to connect with Native art and supply a beautiful activity to enjoy at home.</p>
<p>My passion for Native American-made art, familiarity with Native artists, and attention to detail prepare me to create and run a business that I am very excited to share with you-- I just need some support getting it off the ground.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I am Asking For</h3>
<p>The first series of Wahani Puzzles will feature three puzzles of art each by a different Native artist (more on them below!). While I am personal investing a significant amount, I am asking for additional support to help with the start-up costs. Our target is $4500, which will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logo and branding design (by a Native designer!)</li>
<li>Manufacturing of the initial puzzle series</li>
<li>Transportation of the manufactured puzzles to Flagstaff, AZ for distribution</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to ""claim"" a perk if you are able to contribute any funds by making your selection on the right!</p>

<p><strong>Are you Native....</strong> and tired of the cheesy products that represent us in gift shops? Do you feel like everyone else regards us as a monolith? Do you longingly look at Native art and wish it was in your home-- or is that just me? Maybe you're already into puzzles but struggle to find imagery you connect to.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe you aren't Native....<i> </i></strong>and want to learn more about Native art but aren't sure how. Have you ever wandered a museum gift shop, unsure if the products actually support Native people or were even <i>created</i> by Native people? Have you ever wanted to purchase something Native-made but were worried if it was appropriate for you to have in your home?</p>
<p><strong>Well here comes Wahani Puzzles.</strong></p>
<p>This business addresses the lack of respectful, affordable, at-home access to the diversity of the Indigenous art of this continent. You'll be able to sit around a table with your roommates or family piecing together a beautiful piece of art, referencing the puzzle box to learn about the artist and the history. Maybe you'll keep your puzzle all to yourself, turning to it as a relaxing activity away from the TV.</p>
<p>A portion of the sale of each Wahani puzzle will go to that puzzle's artist.</p>

The canvas will be a large piece of plywood (~3' x 5') and should say ""Progress"" somewhere. Other than that, we are giving artistic license to whomever would like to work on this.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Over the last decade I have been fortunate enough to create kustom art for a variety of different companies. I have worked with music events, bands, apparel and surf companies - all of which have allowed me to come up with my own ideas for art, posters, t-shirts, and accessories. These products have always been funded by the clients for which I am incredibly grateful...however, my dream is to also start producing my own Kruse merchandise.</p>
<p>This is were my <i>Indiegogo</i> project comes in. With your help, I can finally get this underway, and ideally, also get more art out into the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you dsupport this campaign it will help fund a limited edition run of El Borracho silkscreen posters! These posters are only for this campaign and if they all go... they won't be available anywhere else. Only here, and only for the next 30 days.</p>
<p>Any extra funds will go toward a much needed website where I will be able to sell my art. To be straight, I am a self-taught, lowbrow artist. I just do art. And for many years now I have needed to hire someone to build a website to merchandise all the other current and upcoming Kruse designs. </p>
<p><strong>So you're probably asking yourself, ""What do I get out of this?""</strong></p>
<p>Let me just say that any level of support is greatly appreciated, and depending on how much you are able to contribute, you may receive any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sticker packages</li>
<li>Iron-on embroidered patches</li>
<li>Borracho t-shirt </li>
<li>Limited Edition Borracho 18"" x 24"" Silkscreen poster !!! (signed &amp; numbered out of 100)</li>
<li>Giclée print of a brand new design, ""Coffink"" 18"" x 24"" poster</li>
<li><i>Or, all of the above!!</i></li>
</ul>
<p>All will come with extra stuff!!! So you'll be stoked, no matter what you choose.</p>
<p><i><strong>Please note</strong> ~ To make this campaign international, any support from outside the United States may be contacted regarding shipping cost. </i></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Hello friends, family, and supporters!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am a fiber artist and painter newly living in Burlington, VT after spending the last ten years in Boston. I am excited to reveal plans for some new large projects for Lauren Kenneally: Fine Art; Not-So-Fine Art.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>The short of it:</strong> I am looking to make several whimsical, human-sized, needle-felted animal sculptures.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>The long of it:</strong> These creatures will lovingly explore a ""hipster-culture"" fairytale world where commonly-loved animals do human things. An owl will strum a banjo, a vest-clad fox will squeeze an accordion, and a dapper bear will indulge in commonly-loved Vermont pass-times. The goal is for them to be a fun, engaging, relateable, and aesthetically-pleasing commentary on the culture that so many of us are a part of, (or are at least familiar with), these days. These creatures will be available for sale, and my goal is to have them on display in Vermont-based galleries. Once the first large sculpture is made, I will be submitting my work to Frog Hollow, Vermont's State Craft Center, (more information at <a href=""http://www.froghollow.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.froghollow.org</a>), and Burlington City Arts.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is where I turn to you, my dear community. I can't make this project come true without your support and you will be rewarded handsomely for your sweet generosity!</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div> </div>
<div> What your money goes to:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Several colors of quality, local, long-staple wool roving in large quantities. (This is the expensive part.)</li>
<li>Chicken wire.</li>
<li>Large-guage wire.</li>
<li>Felting needles.</li>
<li>Any other unforeseen miscellaneous supply costs.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hope to get started on these sculptures as soon as possible and my time frame for completing about four of them is roughly 4 months. I hope to turn out the first piece by the end of September. I expect each creature will cost upwards of $300 in materials to make and I hope to make at least four.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have many incentives for this project, so please take a look! You can email me or send me a facebook message for the incentives that allow you to pick specifics. *I'm not sure why each prize is repeating itself several times on the site. I've tried fixing it, but it insists on showing up a whole bunch of times for each option. It should work just fine, though.*</div>

<p><strong>THE <em>FOUND FESTIVAL</em>:</strong></p>
<p>This summer, we are organizing and hosting Edmonton’s second-annual <em>Found Festival</em>, an interdisciplinary performing arts event taking place in the Old Strathcona District from June 27-30, 2013. After our out-all-night, glam-jam Opening Gala, emerging artists across numerous disciplines will showcase their work in various unconventional site-specific — or “found” — spaces. Each event runs twice and has been uniquely tailored to Edmonton's urban landscape. Think: plays in moving cars, moonlit evening performances and dancing in the treetops!</p>
<p>Our artists have been working for months to create exciting, dynamic pieces that will have you running, laughing and tearing your way through one of Edmonton’s most beloved arts districts. In order to make this possible, WE NEED YOUR HELP!</p>
<p>Many costs are associated with creating a festival of this magnitude, but ALL DONATIONS MADE THROUGH OUR INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN GO DIRECTLY TOWARDS PAYING OUR FESTIVAL ARTISTS! We believe artists deserve to be paid for their work, with no exceptions. However, in order to make that (as well as the festival) happen, we need outside support. Every donation really does help and even small gifts add up quickly!</p>

I am opening a retail shop and creative space formerly known as Ecocentric that I’ve lovingly named Wild Pines. </p><p>Wild Pines is the culmination of my favorite things: Art, nature, intentional living, adventure, and great earrings! It is more than a store. It is a place to gather, connect, learn, and find inspiration. Building on the legacy of EcoCentric, Wild Pines will continue to be a <strong>women-owned business</strong>, providing local and global products created with integrity and purpose. As an artist myself, I am excited to expand the number of local artisans and innovative makers that we carry. I am also over the moon to have my own studio space in the shop so visitors can see my process of making up-cycled jewelry and more! In addition, Wild Pines will also be carrying a new selection of items that are unique and useful while adventuring in the Lost Sierra and beyond. </p><p>In the future, I plan to host classes, workshops, and small events in the outdoor space behind the shop. I will be offering art classes and inviting local craftspeople and naturalists to come and share their knowledge. These programs will provide a chance to connect Plumas County residents and enhance the experience of visitors to the Lost Sierra. </p><p>As people migrate out of cities &amp; reconnect their lives to the more intentional living found in small towns, Graeagle is poised to see greater numbers of new residents and tourists alike.  Wild Pines has an awesome opportunity to help shape the trajectory of the Graeagle community. Right now seems like the perfect time to be opening a shop in the heart of this magical mountain town!</p><p><u><strong>Wild Pines: What we need to get there</strong></u></p><p>I am basically starting from scratch, and until this summer, was not planning on becoming a retail shop owner, so I need to raise a significant amount of money, plain and simple. I’ve already pulled together a number of pieces to create a workable financing package, but more is needed, which is why I’m reaching out to friends, family, and community members to assist. Please help me get the word out by sharing my campaign through your various social networks, and please pledge whatever amount you can afford. <strong>One of the most common reasons that small business startups struggle is due to undercapitalization and I am determined to avoid that!</strong> My goal is to raise $8,000 through this campaign which is less than a fourth of what I ultimately need to help with the following costs:</p><ul>
<li>
<i>Infrastructure and hardware</i>: Although I plan on staying on the frugal side, I do want to give the space a fresh look and feel. Computers/Point of Sale upgrades, a phone, some new fixtures, efficient lighting upgrades, and an updated exterior space--are all at the top of my list.</li>
<li>
<i>Inventory</i>: Hands down my biggest expense. While the retail space is not huge, it does require a healthy amount of inventory to be full. Because I’m a start-up, I need money upfront to get products from vendors and craftspeople. </li>
<li>
<i>Turning the lights on</i>: Rent, insurance, utilities, all go into effect before the store opens in April. </li>
<li>
<i>Emergency Fund</i>: Unexpected costs are a given, so I need to make sure I have money set aside to cover them if and when they come up.</li>

I am opening a retail shop and creative space formerly known as Ecocentric that I’ve lovingly named Wild Pines. Wild Pines is the culmination of my favorite things: Art, nature, intentional living, adventure, and great earrings! It is more than a store. It is a place to gather, connect, learn, and find inspiration. Building on the legacy of EcoCentric, Wild Pines will continue to be a women-owned business, providing local and global products created with integrity and purpose. As an artist myself, I am excited to expand the number of local artisans and innovative makers that we carry. I am also over the moon to have my own studio space in the shop so visitors can see my process of making up-cycled jewelry and more! In addition, Wild Pines will also be carrying a new selection of items that are unique and useful while adventuring in the Lost Sierra and beyond. In the future, I plan to host classes, workshops, and small events in the outdoor space behind the shop. I will be offering art classes and inviting local craftspeople and naturalists to come and share their knowledge. These programs will provide a chance to connect Plumas County residents and enhance the experience of visitors to the Lost Sierra. As people migrate out of cities & reconnect their lives to the more intentional living found in small towns, Graeagle is poised to see greater numbers of new residents and tourists alike.  Wild Pines has an awesome opportunity to help shape the trajectory of the Graeagle community. Right now seems like the perfect time to be opening a shop in the heart of this magical mountain town!Wild Pines: What we need to get thereI am basically starting from scratch, and until this summer, was not planning on becoming a retail shop owner, so I need to raise a significant amount of money, plain and simple. I’ve already pulled together a number of pieces to create a workable financing package, but more is needed, which is why I’m reaching out to friends, family, and community members to assist. Please help me get the word out by sharing my campaign through your various social networks, and please pledge whatever amount you can afford. One of the most common reasons that small business startups struggle is due to undercapitalization and I am determined to avoid that! My goal is to raise $8,000 through this campaign which is less than a fourth of what I ultimately need to help with the following costs:

Infrastructure and hardware: Although I plan on staying on the frugal side, I do want to give the space a fresh look and feel. Computers/Point of Sale upgrades, a phone, some new fixtures, efficient lighting upgrades, and an updated exterior space--are all at the top of my list.

Inventory: Hands down my biggest expense. While the retail space is not huge, it does require a healthy amount of inventory to be full. Because I’m a start-up, I need money upfront to get products from vendors and craftspeople. 

Turning the lights on: Rent, insurance, utilities, all go into effect before the store opens in April. 

Emergency Fund: Unexpected costs are a given, so I need to make sure I have money set aside to cover them if and when they come up.
Even the smallest contribution of $5 will help me achieve this goal. In fact, if every one of my Facebook friends gave $5 — I would meet my goal! If you can't give financially, I totally understand, and still love you. You might consider sharing this project on your Facebook or Twitter accounts to help spread the word.

<p><b>A bit of context</b></p>
<p>Old people –
PAH! Grumpy, moaning, ‘in our day ...’, slow, get in the way, ‘in the good old
days ...’, a drain on resources ....</p>
<p><strong>NOT SO.</strong></p>
<p>In March of
last year we embarked on our first serious arts and cultural programme with
older people ... and it’s been a revelation. Energy, enthusiasm, commitment,
creativity, passion, drive, humour – all there in boundless supply. It went so
well and everyone enjoyed it so much that we’re proposing <em><em><em><strong>FURTIVE ARTS</strong></em></em></em> – our
next big idea and our first foray into the world of crowdfunding.</p>
<p>We aim to
bring older people out from shadows and into the heart of the community – in a
very real yet undercover way – to make passers-by smile, younger people
curious, visitors intrigued ... and the community proud of the contribution of
its older members. </p>
<p>Oh – and we
should say that we’re based in Belfast ... on the iconic Shankill Road. Once
bustling and the place to be and to shop, it’s been battered by economic,
political and urban redevelopment pressures. But now it’s fighting back by
embracing the new spirit of Northern Ireland and re-connecting with the old
spirit of the Shankill. </p>
<p><b>What we have planned</b></p>
<p>We’ll run 4 workshops,
each lasting for 4 weeks, with 4 different groups. The workshops will cover
knitting, crochet, photography, and ceramics and will be led by an experienced
and age-sensitive artist. Older participants will be supported to create pieces
of artwork. There will be a relatively blank canvas to allow for creativity and
freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Completed works (quilts, ‘oldie Selfies’, plant pots) will then be <b><i>furtively</i></b>
placed in very public locations for the whole community to enjoy before older
people ‘confess’ to being responsible!</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We need
£3850 to run the 16 week project. This will fund artists, materials, venues,
and help us record and evaluate the project. </p>
<p>In return we
offer the chance to grab some unique rewards – as Housing Associations or
Sheltered Accommodation to get some arts and crafts workshops and materials; as
companies to roll back the years and have a tea trolley visit your base; and as
an individual own a limited edition, uniquely designed (thanks Trisha Campbell)
badge, window cling or mug!</p>
<p>If we don’t reach
our target all funds used will go on workshops with older people and people
living with dementia – we might need to scale back but we’ll still deliver!! </p>
<p><b>What we hope to achieve</b></p>
<p><b>For the older people and people
living with dementia</b>
who will participate in the workshops we offer the opportunity to come together
and socialise, be creative, learn new skills, feel good about themselves,
reminisce, and find a vital place again within their community. .</p>
<p><b>For the artists involved</b> – to hone their skills and
techniques, work sensitively with older people, and facilitate great creativity
and expression.</p>
<p><b>For us at Spectrum</b> – to work with older people from a range
of different settings - residential homes, sheltered accommodation, supported
housing, day centres; improve our understanding of the needs of older people
and people living with dementia; to bring art to the heart of the community;
and to get ideas and suggestions for our next phase of work. </p>
<p><b>And for our community</b> – foster intergenerational respect;
appreciate the creativity and positive contribution of older people; and love
that the artwork will brighten and enhance public spaces. </p>
<p><b>The bigger picture</b></p>
<p>And we’re
already thinking ahead with big, bold and ambitious plans for a 12 month
programme of arts and cultural activity, with 5 partner organisations, and a
social entrepreneurial twist of training older people to become community
artists and for their art work to be regularly available at the local artisan
market – so we might be back.</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you can’t
contribute hard cash you can still show your support – just help us get our
message out to as wide an audience as possible. </p>
<p>So feel free
to post, text, tweet, email ... or just even have an old-fashioned chat!!</p>

of artwork. There will be a relatively blank canvas to allow for creativity and
freedom of expression.
Completed works (quilts, ‘oldie Selfies’, plant pots) will then be furtively
placed in very public locations for the whole community to enjoy before older
people ‘confess’ to being responsible!
What we need


We need
£3850 to run the 16 week project. This will fund artists, materials, venues,
and help us record and evaluate the project. 
In return we
offer the chance to grab some unique rewards – as Housing Associations or
Sheltered Accommodation to get some arts and crafts workshops and materials; as
companies to roll back the years and have a tea trolley visit your base; and as
an individual own a limited edition, uniquely designed (thanks Trisha Campbell)
badge, window cling or mug!
If we don’t reach
our target all funds used will go on workshops with older people and people
living with dementia – we might need to scale back but we’ll still deliver!! 
What we hope to achieve
For the older people and people
living with dementia
who will participate in the workshops we offer the opportunity to come together
and socialise, be creative, learn new skills, feel good about themselves,
reminisce, and find a vital place again within their community. .
For the artists involved – to hone their skills and
techniques, work sensitively with older people, and facilitate great creativity
and expression.
For us at Spectrum – to work with older people from a range
of different settings - residential homes, sheltered accommodation, supported
housing, day centres; improve our understanding of the needs of older people
and people living with dementia; to bring art to the heart of the community;
and to get ideas and suggestions for our next phase of work. 
And for our community – foster intergenerational respect;
appreciate the creativity and positive contribution of older people; and love
that the artwork will brighten and enhance public spaces. 
The bigger picture
And we’re
already thinking ahead with big, bold and ambitious plans for a 12 month
programme of arts and cultural activity, with 5 partner organisations, and a
social entrepreneurial twist of training older people to become community
artists and for their art work to be regularly available at the local artisan
market – so we might be back.
PS


If you can’t
contribute hard cash you can still show your support – just help us get our
message out to as wide an audience as possible. 
So feel free
to post, text, tweet, email ... or just even have an old-fashioned chat!!

Dream!</strong><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm
just some guy who wants to start tattooing. My name is Aaron, and
I've always wanted to be able to support myself with my artistic
endeavors. I've loved tattoos as long as I can remember, and I've had
the tattoos that I wanted mapped out since 5th grade (thankfully I
never did get those 90's flame wristbands). I'm currently serving in
the United States Air Force, but after a chance encounter with the
great Heath Thomas (owner and operator or Florida Unique Tattoos)
while he was tattooing my wife's forearm, he encouraged me to bring
in my portfolio after I expressed how much I loved tattoos and wish I
could get into the industry. Fast forward, and here I am in my
apprenticeship, ready to make my initial gear purchase so I can start
working on REAL LIVE SKIN! I am overjoyed that I've made it through
my apprenticeship far enough to start tattooing people, however, I am
met with one problem: Holy crap, all of this gear is expensive.</p><p>****Check out these god-awful portraits I'll do for $15. Embarrass your friends, confuse your coworkers, TRICK YOUR FAMILY!

<p>I
realize that I could reasonably save the money needed to get started,
but it would take much longer than if I received some financial help.
I only have one year left in the Air Force and I need to get started
tattooing as soon as possible to prove to my wife and myself that I
can support us with my art. This said, the sooner I can get my
equipment, the sooner I can begin tattooing and improving, the sooner
I can develop awesome loyal clients, the sooner I can begin
transitioning to life as a civilian who makes his money in the
amazingly awesome career field of tattoos! Your donations will
directly contribute to me living out something I once thought was
only a half-baked daydream.</p>
<p><strong><u>The
Tools (and Perks!)</u></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I
need $2,200 in order to get my initial set up rolling to include:</p>
<p>-
Tattoo machines (one liner, one shader) - $800</p>
<p>-
Power supply, clip cord, needles, tubes/grips, inks - $500+ 
</p>
<p>-
Storage chest - $400</p>
<p>-
Arm rest - $40</p>
<p>-
Mayo stand - $100</p>
<p>This
all totals to $1,840. The remaining $360 will be used to cover
shipping costs, and if there is enough, I will purchase additional
needles, tubes/grips, and inks (my current ink purchase plan is only
for sample sizes, ink is super expensive!).</p>
<p>The
absolute bare minimum that I need to get started is approximately
$1,500 to cover the costs of my machines, power supply, clip cord,
needles, tubes/grips, inks and the shipping costs associated with all
of it.</p>
<p>In
exchange for your support, there is a collection of awesome things
that you can get in return! These include:</p>
<p>-
A poem (written from the bottom of my heart), a terrible photo of me
that you can use for the purpose of blackmail at a later date,
stickers with my original art on them, high quality digital prints of
my orginal art, wood cut prints of my original art (I'll make each of
these prints by hand with ink and wood... I think that's pretty neat,
but I'm also a nerd), and a custom ink and watercolor portrait of
you. Also, if you bankroll the whole thing, you'll get all of the
before mentioned perks, a hand-written letter of gratitude, and a
large canvas painting of subject matter of your choosing. </p><p>

<p><strong><u>The
Impact</u></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I
don't intend to stop at tattooing. I intend to go to school for a
fine arts degree and eventually work my way to teaching as well as
tattooing. I would love to teach both at a college level and at a
community level. I want children and young adults who don't have the
finances to get training to have an opportunity to get that training
along with a wealth of free resources so they can tell their story
through art. Tattooing can help me pay the bills and continue to hone
my artistic abilities while I'm gaining an education.</p>
<p>I
love tattoos and I want to help people express themselves and be
closer to how they see themselves. I want to help people remember
their loved ones through living art. I want to help people remind
themselves to be better. I want to help people look down at their arm
and smile at a piece that they got just because they thought it was
cool or funny. I want to achieve self actualization by helping others
do the same.</p>
<p>Your
contributions will help me get started down a path where I can
hopefully help people through art. </p>
<p><strong><u>The
Struggle is Real</u></strong></p>
<p> There
is always a chance that I don't make it through the remainder of my
apprenticeship. Family problems, suddenly getting deployed, or simply
just not being good at inking people, etc. There are any number of
things that could interfere. I've already had to overcome several
obstacles regarding just having time to balance working for the Air
Force, apprenticing, and trying to make sure that I'm being a good
husband who takes care of his wife and keeps her happy. There are
some things that you just can't account for, and that's something
that I have to continue to be aware of, but I intend to continue hard
charging until I make it and become a full fledged tattoo artist.</p>

<p><span class=""notranslate"">Hi, I'm Hunter Moon Laytart and roller derby has changed my life. Now my dad and I have come up with a great idea to share the roller derby love with girls all over the planet. <strong>My Roller Derby World Do It Yourself Trading Cards.</strong></span></p>
<p>Two years ago I asked my dad for a pair of roller skates for my birthday. The next morning my dad showed me a video of a f<em>lat track roller derby bout</em> and I knew immediately, I had found my sport. I was born to be a roller girl.</p>
<p>I started practicing roller derby with my dad at my local skate park in Northern California. After a year of training at the skate park, most of the time being the only girl (and the only roller girl all the time), we found a flier advertising a Jr. Roller Derby Camp.</p>
<p><img alt=""The only roller girl at my skate park"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/278/261/28ebec7037301c0de7594df3e9c05e83_large.png?1353861149"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Now, I'm Hunter Bee on my first Jr. roller derby team, The Ego Breakers. I love getting knocked down, picking myself up, racing and getting whipped around the track. I love all the other roller derby girls I'm meeting and playing with too. Roller derby is my life and I want to share this experience with girls everywhere!</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/279/249/913d6d0df2ab9fbef8db822b8abc625d_large.png?1353907471"" src="""" style=""""/><p>So, my dad and I have come up with the company <a href=""http://www.myrollerderbyworld.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>MyRollerDerbyWorld.com</strong></a> to help spread the derby love!</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.myrollerderbyworld.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MyRollerDerbyWorld.com</a> is a <strong>Do It Yourself Roller Derby Trading Card Template that allows you to upload your picture, then design and modify the layout of your own personal trading cards</strong>. Once you're done, you can either print them on your computer, or you can submit your order to us, and just like that you have your own personal professional trading cards delivered to your home.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/278/270/dbbece32cd4a12b93e43a4e8af6c9028_large.png?1353861306"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Roller derby started here in America and was the first sport where women competed on the same level as men. In recent years it has had a renewed popularity which has expanded all over the world! There are even roller derby teams in Africa and in Greenland!</p>
<p>The money we are raising will allow us to create the website and template so you can design and modify your own personal trading cards. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/279/259/9132a3badd49ac6457516dbbb5002408_large.png?1353908389"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My dad has ten plus years of experience in the Outdoor Sports Industry working trade shows and doing sales and marketing. He knows exactly where to market and sell <a href=""http://www.myrollerderbyworld.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MyRollerDerbyWorld.com.</a></p>
<p>So, if we can reach our goal of $20,000 we can create our BETA version of <a href=""http://MyRollerDerbyWorld.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MyRollerDerbyWorld.com</a> trading card template and website, and still have a little money to spare for advertising at trade shows, in magazines, and on websites like <a href=""http://FiveOnFivemag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FiveOnFivemag.com</a> and <a href=""http://BloodandThundermag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BloodandThundermag.com. </a></p>
<p>We have lists of fun ideas to build out, like having <a href=""http://MyRollerDerbyWorld.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MyRollerDerbyWorld.com</a> maintain a photo gallery of all your past and present trading cards with plans to be an interactive site where members can like and chat with other roller girls, support their favorite players by purchasing their trading cards, find out where and when bouts and fundraisers are happening, and so, so much more!</p>
<p>Girls all over the world can start creating personal Roller Derby Trading Cards all on their own!</p>

<h3 class=""dotty""><span> </span></h3></div>","Hi, I'm Hunter Moon Laytart and roller derby has changed my life. Now my dad and I have come up with a great idea to share the roller derby love with girls all over the planet. My Roller Derby World Do It Yourself Trading Cards.
Two years ago I asked my dad for a pair of roller skates for my birthday. The next morning my dad showed me a video of a flat track roller derby bout and I knew immediately, I had found my sport. I was born to be a roller girl.
I started practicing roller derby with my dad at my local skate park in Northern California. After a year of training at the skate park, most of the time being the only girl (and the only roller girl all the time), we found a flier advertising a Jr. Roller Derby Camp.

Now, I'm Hunter Bee on my first Jr. roller derby team, The Ego Breakers. I love getting knocked down, picking myself up, racing and getting whipped around the track. I love all the other roller derby girls I'm meeting and playing with too. Roller derby is my life and I want to share this experience with girls everywhere!
So, my dad and I have come up with the company MyRollerDerbyWorld.com to help spread the derby love!
MyRollerDerbyWorld.com is a Do It Yourself Roller Derby Trading Card Template that allows you to upload your picture, then design and modify the layout of your own personal trading cards. Once you're done, you can either print them on your computer, or you can submit your order to us, and just like that you have your own personal professional trading cards delivered to your home.

Roller derby started here in America and was the first sport where women competed on the same level as men. In recent years it has had a renewed popularity which has expanded all over the world! There are even roller derby teams in Africa and in Greenland!
The money we are raising will allow us to create the website and template so you can design and modify your own personal trading cards. 

My dad has ten plus years of experience in the Outdoor Sports Industry working trade shows and doing sales and marketing. He knows exactly where to market and sell MyRollerDerbyWorld.com.
So, if we can reach our goal of $20,000 we can create our BETA version of MyRollerDerbyWorld.com trading card template and website, and still have a little money to spare for advertising at trade shows, in magazines, and on websites like FiveOnFivemag.com and BloodandThundermag.com. 
We have lists of fun ideas to build out, like having MyRollerDerbyWorld.com maintain a photo gallery of all your past and present trading cards with plans to be an interactive site where members can like and chat with other roller girls, support their favorite players by purchasing their trading cards, find out where and when bouts and fundraisers are happening, and so, so much more!
Girls all over the world can start creating personal Roller Derby Trading Cards all on their own!
And we have already started our second phase:

TheRollerDerbyTradingCardCompany.com where we will begin pre-packaging and selling Roller Derby All Star trading cards. For more info check out our video and updates on our Facebook. www.Facebook.com/MyRollerDerbyWorld
For Perks, we don't want to create a bunch of shwag ""stuff"" for you, we want to put as much money into the site and cards as possible and deliver to everyone who receives a membership to MyRollerDerbyWorld.com - the most amazing interactive D.I.Y. trading card site on the planet!

Thanks Everyone. Keep spreading the derby love!!

<h2>J'AIME ÇA CRU</h2>
<p>L'exposition collective <em>J'aime ça cru</em> présente au grand public le fruit du labeur des finissants en Arts Plastiques du Cégep du Vieux-Montréal. Il s'agit de l'aboutissement des efforts investis tout au long du programme par les 67 étudiants, qui, le 22 mai 2013, lanceront leur exposition de fin d'année.</p>
<p>Oeuvres, performances, musique en direct et buffet rendront cette soirée la plus mémorable possible. Toutefois, étant entièrement organisé par les étudiants, ce vernissage s'accompagne de plusieurs dépenses importantes et c'est ici que nous aurons besoin de votre aide.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>LES BESOINS</h3>
<p>Une grande quantité d'argent  nous est nécessaire pour organiser l'évènement. Nous avons entre autres besoin de financer :</p>
<ul>
<li>L'alcool, bière et vin, mis à disposition des visiteurs lors du vernissage</li>
<li>La nourriture qui se retrouvera au buffet</li>
<li>Le service des agents de sécurité pour assurer le bon déroulement de la soirée</li>
<li>Le service des techniciens qui aideront les étudiants à disposer leurs oeuvres et les éclairer de manière appropriée</li>
<li>Le matériel emprunté et acheté pour installer le buffet et permettre les performances des invités et étudiants</li>
</ul>
<p>L'argent récolté sera encaissé directement dans le compte dédié à l'organisation du vernissage. L'objectif est pour l'instant fixé à 500$, mais s'il n'est pas atteint, la totalité des fonds iront tout de même à financer le vernissage et l'exposition.</p>
<p>Dans le cas d'un surplus d'argent après l'organisation de l'évènement, l'argent restant servira à aider les finissants de la session suivante dans l'organisation de leur exposition.</p>

<p>After adding four more artists and several photos to the book, it is now 140 pages, plus cover—26 more pages than it originally had. As a result I need to raise a few more bucks! Funds exceeding the goal (knock on wood) will be applied to a larger quantity of books printed, marketing and distribution of the book, and the Citizens Artist Collective community programs described below.

<h2>Citizens Warehouse</h2>
<p>Citizens Warehouse is in danger of being lost, which would be a tremendous shame as the community of artists here would be displaced, as well as BICAS and their Art Annex. Currently, Citizens Warehouse offers affordable studio space to these artists which, if lost, would negatively impact the arts community—specifically, the Tucson Historic Warehouse Arts District.</p>
<p>The Historic Warehouse Arts District in downtown Tucson is an eclectic, thriving and growing community. Citizens Warehouse, a cornerstone to this community, is home to 24 artists of varied mediums and disciplines. For the past few months I have been working on this art book featuring the artists of Citizens Warehouse—<strong>and</strong> <strong>it is now ready to go to the printer!</strong></p>
<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of the book is to support and give exposure to the artists in Citizens Warehouse. It showcases select works from the artists, amounting to more than 150 full color images of paintings, drawings, sculpture, ceramics, metal work, furnishings, and multi-media art. There are also photographs to illustrate the culture of the warehouse from events, excursions and figure drawing sessions. It is a perfect bound art book measuring 8""x10"" closed, with a soft cover, 140 pages in length.</p>
<p><strong>The book features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Foreword by Julie Sasse, Chief Curator and Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, Tucson Musuem of Art.</li>
<li>An Introduction by author Dennis Herrick.</li>
<li>History of the Tucson Historic Warehouse District and the Citizens Warehouse with essays by Dave Devine, David Aguirre and Poster Frost Mirto, Inc.</li>
<li>A map of the Historic Warehouse District from the City of Tucson Historic Preservation Office.</li>
<li>Essays about Citizens Artist Collective (CAC), Bicycle Inter-Community Art and Salvage (BICAS), and Warehouse Arts Management Organization (WAMO).</li>
<li>
<strong>Twenty-four artists from Citizens Warehouse</strong>, each artist having four pages featuring their bios and select, full-color images of their work.</li>
<li>Photographs from in and around the artist studios and the warehouse.</li>
</ul><h3>Book Sales</h3>
<p>All money generated from the sales of this book after printing will be donated to funds for maintenance and repairs on the building, further marketing and promotion of the artists who work here, community programs such as field trips and workshops for students, and programs to help protect the warehouse—insuring it remain a vital part of the Arts District Community.</p>
<h3>Our Deadline</h3>
<p>This campaign only goes through the end of the month. And the sooner the goal is reached, the more likely we will be able to have the book ready for the Spring Open Studio Tour—which would be awesome. <strong>Please contribute today!</strong></p>

In 2013 I released a photograph every single day with one goal in mind: To publish this book, a 365-day photo journal created to abolish human trafficking. www.shoottheskies.comIn addition to being a beautiful display piece to inspire awareness and conversation, 100% of the profits from this book will go The A21 Campaign.The A21 CampaignThere are an estimated 27 million slaves in the world today. A21 takes a unique approach to combat those overwhelming numbers by focusing on rescuing one victim at a time. Check them out at www.thea21campaign.orgA Year On The RoadStarting last January, I spent a few months working my way around Seattle & the Northwest, but there was so much more to capture. In May I moved out of my apartment and took to the road in my 1987 Oldsmobile. Some of the highlights that you’ll see in the book are from the 20 national parks and 5 countries that I visited over the following 7 months.Giving up the comforts of home was a sacrifice, but the adventure I had in return was worth it all. This project couldn't have happened without the generosity of the family, friends, and strangers who helped me along the way.I saw some of the most beautiful views that this planet has to offer. It is scenery that stands in sharp contrast to the darkness of the trafficking that I hope to expose. I’m truly proud of the shots that you’ll see in this book, as well as the stories behind them.With a little help from my friendsIn addition to the photos, I asked some inspiring leaders to share their thoughts on fighting trafficking. People like Jason Kennedy from E! News, Christine Caine the founder of A21 and NY times best selling author Judah Smith had some encouraging things to say. Their interviews will definitely challenge you the way they challenged me.Who I amI’m Tanner Wendell Stewart, a professional photographer born and bred in Wallowa County Oregon but have been living in Seattle for the past 8 years.My first photograph was published by a local newspaper when I was 13. They paid me $13.50 and I bought a punk rock CD: MxPx’s Teenage Politics.Since then, I’ve made it my life’s work to capture the beauty of the world I live in. My friends will tell you: I’ll do anything to get the perfect shot. I hope you enjoy the book and give as much as you can to help The A21 Campaign end human trafficking, once and for all.What We Need & What You GetEvery single book in the 1st edition will be numbered, signed by me and sent to your door. When you buy a book, you're giving around $17 to print the book and cover indiegogo’s fee. The remaining $28 will be donated to the A21 Campaign. Which means this book could raise close to $28,000 dollars to abolish injustice and modern day slavery.
I need to sell a minimum of 1000 books. If I sell 1,500 books the cost goes down by $4 and 2,000 books by $5. I will be very transparent about all the details and progress. I am taking no proceeds or reimbursements from the book but cannot afford to fund the book myself. 
International shipping, please add $5 dollars to the donation. Thank You!
Since I’ll be managing every aspect of the book printing process, I am only selling the book and no additional perks, just books and more books.
It was suggested that a 400 page 8x10 book with photos like mine should be sold for  $70 dollars. I wanted to make this as affordable as possible, but still a significant amount of money to donate.
The book is being printed in china but I refuse to print somewhere that would compromise what this project fights for. I’ve spent a lot of time researching quality and making sure of fair working conditions/wages. 
If the goal is not reached, all of your money will be refunded and this will have been the greatest adventure of my life (thus far) and a great awareness campaign for A21.
The Impact
You buying this book could raise close to $28,000 dollars for the A21 Campaign. 
The book is about 90% done but is now waiting on the finances. By the time the campaign is over I’ll be ready to send the Shoot The Skies book to print.
No matter the future of this project, I’m dedicated to giving the proceeds of the book away, so if you see this book published down the road, it will still give all proceeds to A21.
Other Ways You Can Help
Its a dream come true to print this book. Words cannot describe how excited I am for the opportunity to have the book in your hands.

Questions</b></p>
<p><b><i>What is glass
engraving?</i></b>
Glass engraving is a technique that uses wheels of various sizes and shapes to
carve impressions into glass. Contemporary engraving commonly uses wheel
impregnated with diamonds for cutting. Glass engraving allows for artist to add
highly detailed images and patterns to glass.</p>
<p><b><i>Why the Czech
Republic?</i> </b>The Czech Republic is known for producing the finest
glass engraving in the world.</p>
<p><b><i>Where is Novy Bor?</i> </b>Novy Bor is located in
the northern portion of the Czech Republic. Although it only has a
population of 12,000 people, is home to two glass museums as well as a glass
trade school for high school students. There are several glass studios and
artisans located in Novy Bor.</p>
<p><b><i>Why not take a class
in the United States?</i></b> The US has several well established glass schools that bring in
quality engraving instructors from all over the world. However, most of them
have limited amount of engraving lathes. You might have as many as twelve
students sharing four lathes. This greatly limits practice time which is
essential. I am getting private lessons in the Czech Republic (including travel
expenses) for less than the cost of most US classes.</p>
<p><b><i>Will you be doing
additional travel?</i> </b>Yes. It was a summer trip to Europe in undergrad that introduced
me to glass. Going into my final year of graduate school, my thesis year, seems
like a great time to explore both historic and contemporary glass in Europe. In
addition to taking this class, I will be giving a glass flameworking
demonstration at VICARTE at Universidade Nova De Lisboa located in Lisbon,
Portugal. All cost for additional travel will be incurred by me, not from this

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Project Cellule is an art/science fusion piece created by two students in their final year at the University of Westminster. </span><br/></p>
<p>The piece explores the ways in which humans may be individuals, but work towards, and within, a larger network. In this sense, humans can be seen as individual cells that exist within a unified body - a body that requires each cell to perform a function in order to work. Unlike most installations, the feedback you receive from interacting with our piece will emphasise the network existence, using your presence to manipulate what others experience.</p>
<p>Our work will take form as a large web of woven IV tubes that will sprawl across the floor,walls and ceiling of the gallery - occasionally falling into a cell inspired structure. Through these tubes we intend to pump bioluminescent fluid, reminiscent of single cell ocean organisms. This fluid will be manipulatable through sensory points around the room; heat, movement, pulse and breath monitors will allow the viewer to change the flow and colour of the liquid in part of the piece. </p>
<p>This is a challenging and large project, pushing both our creative and scientific boundaries. We hope that you feel as excited about the prospect of this piece as we do - if you do, please follow our tumblr for updates on our progress and challenges along the way. If you would like to donate to our project, we would be so grateful for even a small donation to help us bring our vision to life. We hope this will be a spectacular but humbling experience, both for the viewer of the final project and for us along the journey.</p>
<p>This is the breakdown of our budget. </p>

<p>We are students ourselves and understand that money is tight, so, if you cannot afford to give us any dosh - fear not. We will be in desperate need of weavers. You heard correctly, weavers. Our piece involves weaving over 1,000 meters of tubing and if we were to do it alone we are certain we would go insane. If you would like to donate the odd afternoon to us, we would be so grateful and will of course supply tea and biscuits for all involved.

<p></p></span></div>","Project Cellule is an art/science fusion piece created by two students in their final year at the University of Westminster. 
The piece explores the ways in which humans may be individuals, but work towards, and within, a larger network. In this sense, humans can be seen as individual cells that exist within a unified body - a body that requires each cell to perform a function in order to work. Unlike most installations, the feedback you receive from interacting with our piece will emphasise the network existence, using your presence to manipulate what others experience.
Our work will take form as a large web of woven IV tubes that will sprawl across the floor,walls and ceiling of the gallery - occasionally falling into a cell inspired structure. Through these tubes we intend to pump bioluminescent fluid, reminiscent of single cell ocean organisms. This fluid will be manipulatable through sensory points around the room; heat, movement, pulse and breath monitors will allow the viewer to change the flow and colour of the liquid in part of the piece. 
This is a challenging and large project, pushing both our creative and scientific boundaries. We hope that you feel as excited about the prospect of this piece as we do - if you do, please follow our tumblr for updates on our progress and challenges along the way. If you would like to donate to our project, we would be so grateful for even a small donation to help us bring our vision to life. We hope this will be a spectacular but humbling experience, both for the viewer of the final project and for us along the journey.
This is the breakdown of our budget. 


 What you'll get in return for contributing:
We realise this is all in dollars, but it works out cheaper than using british funding sites due to the amount they take as fees. 


$5 - 10


Invitation to the gallery showing of our work.


$15 - 25

Handwritten thank you. 


Eternal love and possibly some baked goods. 




Other ways you can help us:
We are students ourselves and understand that money is tight, so, if you cannot afford to give us any dosh - fear not. We will be in desperate need of weavers. You heard correctly, weavers. Our piece involves weaving over 1,000 meters of tubing and if we were to do it alone we are certain we would go insane. If you would like to donate the odd afternoon to us, we would be so grateful and will of course supply tea and biscuits for all involved. If you are close to either of us, please expect to be doing this regardless of if you offer. 
Please share this amongst any arty folk, scientists or rich people that you know. 
If you would like to contact us about this project, please feel free to do so at projectcellule@gmail.com.

We hope to sustain the space for unique programs like Plumage and Walleye, rehearsals, art-practices, community activities, and rentals through this transition time. To do that (and quite a bit more) we're asking for your help. </span></p>
<p>This fundraiser supports Studio Current and the artists it serves, the art ecology of Seattle, and two neon wig wearing captains as they steer toward lands of increased sustainability for the organization, more support for artists, more programming, and a few dandy updates to the space.<br/></p>
<p>We are Studio Current - in the heart of the Pike/Pine corridor in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Vanessa DeWolf founded the space 11 years ago to support the creative process for artists and their works. It's a space where forms, ideas, community and culture converge. As Vanessa steps into new creative dimensions she passes the captains wig (neon pink, unevenly cut) to kt Shores. <br/></p>
<p>Transitions hold unique challenges and opportunities. Your support makes a big difference toward reaching our sustainability goal -  administrative costs add up quickly, so money raised here will be used to offset some of them. If we reach our goal, we'll be able to give the space some extra TLC: fresh paint, untangling some electrical issues, and updating the blue room and entryway. Most importantly this campaign and your continued support allows us to continue nourishing artists and artistry. The more money we raise, the less expensive it is for artists (and everybody!) to use the space and access the programming.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""> </span>
</h3>
<p>This campaign is funding some of the front loaded administrative costs for Studio Current. Most of our expenses are fairly low, but have been absorbed historically by the director. We've worked hand to mouth, so if we meet our goal about one month's rent for Studio C will be put into a ""rainy day"" fund to help us cover those inevitable times when something goes awry. The rest goes directly into paying for operational costs and a few improvements to the space.</p>
<p>Our creative THANKYOUS,  a score, a poem, a map, video postcard, and co-curate a happening campaign perks are all neat things to enjoy along with the satisfaction of knowing you're supporting Studio Current's growth and longstanding commitment to artistic connection and process.</p>

<h3>
<b>The goal of HKwalls is to create opportunities for local and 
international artists to bring their talents to the streets of Hong Kong
 by transforming ordinary walls into original works of art.</b>
</h3>
<h3>
<b><b>HKwalls的目標是為本地和國際藝術家創造機會展示作品，把普通的大廈外牆變成藝術品，免費供途人欣賞。</b></b>

We have recently added agnès b. as our Festival Partner this yearso we are no longer asking for any further funding and have removed all our ""perks"" from the campaign.      Thank you to everyone who has contributed and everyone who has been so supportive!  Contributors to indiegogo will be contacted soon and still receive their perks.

HKwalls is an annual Street Art Festival in its second year, and will take place from March 13th to the 21st, focusing on  March 14-15th in Sheung Wan and March 20-21st in Stanley Market.

The goal of HKwalls is to create opportunities for local and 
international artists to bring their talents to the streets of Hong Kong
 by transforming ordinary walls into original works of art.


HKwalls的目標是為本地和國際藝術家創造機會展示作品，把普通的大廈外牆變成藝術品，免費供途人欣賞。



Situated at the opposite end of the spectrum from events like Art 
Basel, HKwalls is not for profit and by turning the street into a 
gallery, it provides the public free access to the work, the artists and
 the process.


從巴塞爾藝術博覽會活動光譜的另一端， HKwalls不以盈利為目的，並通過藝術將香港街道變成一個畫廊，向公眾提供免費視覺享受和互動。

In 2014, HKwalls focused on 15 walls in Sheung Wan and involved 19 
artists from Hong Kong and around the world.  This year, we want to make
 HKwalls bigger and better, covering more walls and more territory, 
reaching out to a wider community.  


去年， HKwalls集中在上環一共15面牆和19位來自世界各地的藝術家共同創作。今年，我們要HKwalls做得更大更有趣，希望以此深入到更廣泛的社區。
How can you help? 你怎麼能幫忙？



Donate your exterior wall.  Because without walls, we have nothing to paint.

Make some noise!  Share the project with your friends and family, and spread the word on your favorite social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.

Stay connected. Check back often as things unfold, like us on Facebook, follow us on Instagram and join us in the streets March 9-15th.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Do plays. It's not worth it if you are just in it for the money. You have to love it."" - Philip Seymour Hoffman</strong></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>I'm Stephanie Jones, a Niagara resident, an actor, a playwright, and the Artistic Director of The Essential Collective Theatre.  I am also an acting teacher.  I love theatre and the craft of acting! I began teaching in my early twenties in the basement of the St. Catharines Soccer Club. I am unsure why it was called that, as there was no evidence of soccer being played there, but there was a large basement available, and it was there I first taught improvisation and improv games.  While guiding my students through the basics of improv and story-telling, I soon realized that they became more confident not only during the class session, but in their lives in general. I continued to act, teach and study for the next twenty years, and each of these roles fed and complimented each other.</p>
<p>In recent years, I taught Kindergarten to Grade 8 through Carousel Players Artist in the Classroom Program and presently, I am a part-time acting instructor at Niagara College. I have found one of the most rewarding tools to teach the serious actor (regardless of experience) is the Meisner technique. Although I enjoy all theatre art forms, I have a keen interest in text-based contemporary theatre, and this is the reason for also producing and creating theatre through ECT. Niagara and its artists are important to me, and to be able to teach Meisner technique within our region is a distinct asset.</p>
<p>In 2011, I was the recipient of an Ontario Arts Council Chalmers award in order to attend the Neighborhood Playhouse summer program and study Sanford Meisner’s repetition exercise.  The Neighborhood Playhouse has been a major force in theatre education since it's founding in 1928.

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The actor:</p>
<p>The ability to be fully present with your scene partner, and utilize text as an emotional connection that culminates in climax, is ongoing, and needs to be exercised, like any other physical pursuit.  Without exercise, the muscle relaxes and becomes weak.  Meisner created a unique series of exercises to work this theatrical muscle. The most basic exercise is the repetition exercise and it teaches the actor to be focused out on their partner while continuing to be in action.</p>
<p>Through the Theatre Company - Big Picture - Niagara big</p>
<p>The Essential Collective Theatre specializes in the creation and producing of contemporary, Canadian, text-based theatrical work.  We have produced many modern acclaimed playwrights as well as emerging Niagara writers.  These established Canadian playwrights have influenced our work and other Niagara playwrights, and they contain modern text that supports action-based representational performance.   Without a skilled actor to build upon the playwrights’ blueprint the theatrical picture is incomplete. I will offer classes through the theatre company on my return.</p>
<p>Me:</p>
<p>There is a special moment in the classroom when everything makes sense; the moment when an student actor drops pretense and tells the truth. When that happens the actor is nolonger self-conscious, nolonger trying to imitate, they are fully engaged in the action they are doing, and focused on their partner in the scene.  After that magic moment, the student actor realizes the power they have within themselves, they are what is riveting to watch.   They are enough.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to be offered this unique experience. </p>

Do plays. It's not worth it if you are just in it for the money. You have to love it."" - Philip Seymour Hoffman
Summary:
I'm Stephanie Jones, a Niagara resident, an actor, a playwright, and the Artistic Director of The Essential Collective Theatre.  I am also an acting teacher.  I love theatre and the craft of acting! I began teaching in my early twenties in the basement of the St. Catharines Soccer Club. I am unsure why it was called that, as there was no evidence of soccer being played there, but there was a large basement available, and it was there I first taught improvisation and improv games.  While guiding my students through the basics of improv and story-telling, I soon realized that they became more confident not only during the class session, but in their lives in general. I continued to act, teach and study for the next twenty years, and each of these roles fed and complimented each other.
In recent years, I taught Kindergarten to Grade 8 through Carousel Players Artist in the Classroom Program and presently, I am a part-time acting instructor at Niagara College. I have found one of the most rewarding tools to teach the serious actor (regardless of experience) is the Meisner technique. Although I enjoy all theatre art forms, I have a keen interest in text-based contemporary theatre, and this is the reason for also producing and creating theatre through ECT. Niagara and its artists are important to me, and to be able to teach Meisner technique within our region is a distinct asset.
In 2011, I was the recipient of an Ontario Arts Council Chalmers award in order to attend the Neighborhood Playhouse summer program and study Sanford Meisner’s repetition exercise.  The Neighborhood Playhouse has been a major force in theatre education since it's founding in 1928. This opportunity was to further my skills as an actor and also, to enable me to accurately implement the exercise into my teaching here in Niagara.   I soon discovered it was a skill that needed more time dedicated to it.  After six weeks of training, my previous experience as a performer and an acting instructor were a distinct asset, and I have been invited back to the Playhouse to receive a more detailed coaching experience from Ron Stetson, their senior instructor during January through to March 2013.

<p>The Red Gate Collective is applying to the City of Vancouver to lease their building at 281 Industrial Ave.  We need to raise as much money and support as we can to demonstrate that we have the organizational and financial means to be successful in this location. This is our chance to nail down a location for the next decade and do what we can to make Vancouver not suck.

<h2>Who We Are:</h2>
<p><img alt=""Red Gate June 2010: rylsee &amp; jbiz, cameraman"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://potlatch.net/media/redgate-june2010-crop-sm.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: top;""/></p>
<p>Last fall the Red Gate ""Cultural Wildlife Refuge"" lost its space in Vancouver's downtown eastside to the rising tide of redevelopment. In operation since 2004, the Red Gate was unique in the neighborhood, and the city, in both its longevity as a 100% self-funded and self-organized multi-purpose cultural facility, and in the depth and breadth of participation, collaboration, <img alt=""Red Gate opening, 2010"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://potlatch.net/media/opening-154-sm.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 2px 5px;""/>and support from a large user base that represented the broadest possible cross-section of amateur and professional artists, musicians, film-makers and photographers.</p>
<p>Its three floors and 15,000 square feet accommodated the JC/DC recording studio, home of the New Pornographers, Destroyer, and other internationally recognized recording artists, <img alt='""Humans"" video shoot, Red Gate 2009' class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://potlatch.net/media/humans-video-sm.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 2px 5px;""/> as well as providing affordable studio space for dozens of visual artists, rehearsal and performance space, an art gallery, flexible production facilities for large-format works, film and video production, movie screenings, community meeting space and more. All this made it one of the most well-used and well-loved cultural spaces in the city. Cost to the public: zero dollars. From the beginning we ran ourselves on a voluntary, collective, consensus basis with no outside funding or support of any kind, public or private.<br/><img alt='""Pocket Show"" opening, Red Gate 2010' class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://potlatch.net/media/pocket-show-opening-sm.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 2px 5px; float: left;""/>For the last several years we were involved in complex negotiations between the City of Vancouver's Cultural Department, the Building Department, and the building's owner. In the end the owner decided to simply sell the building rather than undertake the complex and expensive repairs that would be required to keep the building open.<br/><br/>Since that time we've been hunting for a new home in the midst of Vancouver's over-priced real estate market. We found many suitable empty buildings, but they <img alt=""Ben Ratner movie shoot, Red Gate 2010"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://potlatch.net/media/kevin-colleen-shoot-sm.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 2px 5px;""/>are expensive and subject to numerous bylaw, zoning, and allowable use restrictions. Last february we discovered an empty City-owned building at 281 Industrial Avenue in the centrally-located False Creek flats area, and made a proposal to the City to lease the building. We received an immediate response stating that a resolution would shortly be brought to Council to deal with the issue of vanishing cultural space, by directing City staff to identify City-owned buildings which could be leased to arts groups ""on a cost-recovery basis"". We welcomed this news and waited patiently for the promised ""request for proposals"" for the Industrial Ave. space, which finally arrived at the end of July.</p>
<h2>What We're Trying To Do:</h2>
<p>We're currently working on a group proposal with some other displaced artists and creators: deadline for submissions is the end of August. We're seeking collaborators and supporters - if you're looking for space, please direct expressions of interest to <a href=""mailto:redgate@at.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">redgate@at.org</a> - if you want to help us send a message to the City that we're the best group to operate this building, read on.</p>
<h2><img alt=""281 Industrial Ave. exterior"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://potlatch.net/media/281-industrial-ext-sm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<p>In order to secure this space, we will need to demonstrate to the City that we have the  support of the community, and the organizational and financial means to pay the basic rent and expenses, and to undertake any necessary upgrades to the space beyond the basic structure. It's a big space: around 15,000 square feet on the main floor, and another 2500 square feet of office space on the second floor.</p>

<p>It's a lot of space, and at the proposed lease rate of $7.50 per square foot per year, it will cost a lot of money; somewhere in the neighborhood of $12,000 per month including utilities. We're putting in a joint proposal with two other non-profit organizations, involved in the vibrant and forward-looking ""maker"" movement, currently pioneering a high-tech do-it-yourself ethos. The Vancouver Hack Space and the Vancouver Community Laboratory have collaborated recently on several successful ""Maker Faires"" which have been well-received by the media and by the city as a whole. This partnership will serve to offset our space requirements and financial committments, but beyond this we think culture comprises much more, and is more important, than the narrowly-defined ""fine arts"" - we think everyone is, or can be, an artist, and that true creativity exists in all walks of life. We feel that new ideas and new approaches are required now more than ever, in this age of global economic and ecological crises. Experience and history shows that new modes and concepts grow out of the encounters, often unplanned, between previously separate domains of culture. The downtown eastside has historically provided a reservoir of old and inexpensive buildings in which this cross-fertilization of experimental culture could take place, but the recent rapid increase in real estate values has forced such marginal activities elsewhere. The Red Gate's sister studio, directly across the street from our former location, has until the end of August to vacate their 15,000 square foot space; we're also partnering with many of these ""renoviction"" refugees in our proposal to the City.</p>
<p><img alt=""2nd Floor studio"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://potlatch.net/media/red-gate-2nd-floor.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Rather than complain about this state of affairs, we want to do something about it. Rather than join the ragged retreat to more ""artist friendly"" cities like Montreal, Detroit, or Berlin (as many of our friends and colleagues have already done) we intend to re-group, dig in, and do what we can to make Vancouver not suck, to open a new front in the long battle against the stigma of ""No Fun City"". If we don't get this building, we'll find another; there's plenty of empty buildings around town, this one is just particularly well-located, and at the low end of the price scale.</p>
<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>We want to create a space that fosters the widest possible range of collaborative, creative activity. We see culture in the broadest sense as the apex of human expressions and aspirations, the root from which all branches of human activity grow; the sum of all the stories we tell ourselves and each other about who we are and what we're doing. Culture is often considered narrowly as a somewhat marginal and impractical activity, somewhere down the ""hierarchy of needs"" to be enjoyed only after our real, practical tasks are accomplished. we think that culture is <em>the reason we do all the other stuff</em>. There's nothing more practical than having a reason to get out of bed in the morning. <br/><br/>Culture in this broader sense is always an organic synthesis of technical, aesthetic, and social elements. Therefore we see any functioning cultural space as requiring zones for these three overlapping spheres of activity. Accordingly, we intend to partition the building into areas set aside for the advancement of these three elements of culture, with the social element providing the crucial role in integrating the technical and the aesthetic. Some areas will be reserved for workshops devoted to a wide range of technologies, from wood and metal working to electronics, 3D printing and fabrication, and software/interface design and development, to be managed and operated by the VHS and VCL collectives. <img alt=""281 Industrial, floor plans"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://potlatch.net/media/281-Industrial-floor-plans-sm.png"" src="""" style=""""/>A large portion will be dedicated to artist studios and rehearsal space for visual and performing artists, with a mix of shared and private space. And a significant portion will be set aside for common areas and space for special events, exhibitions, performances, and other socially-oriented activities that will be accessible to the general public, as well as providing options for short-term production space for film/video/photographic projects, construction or assembly of large-format art works, meetings and seminars, and other activities that may require a fairly large open space for short periods of time.<br/><br/>The most important function will be to provide this space at rates which are affordable to low-income artists and creators; for us this means less than one dollar per square foot per month. In addition to this we intend to develop any and all means to present and promote the output and activity of our members and tenants, via public exhibitions as well as a weekly webcast showcasing the ideas and projects under development. We think that there is a lot of amazing work being done in Vancouver that is not widely recognized or understood, and we hope to do what we can to change this.</p>

<p>If
you are seeing this, it’s because I really really trust you. I know that no one
has any money, least of all you; much less money to throw at something so
first-world and comfy as what I am about to propose, but if anyone here loves
<b>PHIL KING</b> even a fraction as much as I do and can afford to throw a few bucks
at this “problem” it would be wonderful and make him extremely happy and
contribute to his overall well-being. <br/><br/><b>
FACT</b> : Phil is a Pisces with his Moon in Libra. What this means is that <b>his
birthday is coming up.  </b></p>
<p>Phil
is a devoted father with a teenaged daughter and is currently living in England
as circumstances have made it necessary that he homeschool her. (I'm not uploading a picture of her here as she is a child, but Phil has pictures of her on the facebook). As such he is
trying to piece together a modest income writing articles about art and doing
translation work. Alas, last week <b>his only laptop was broken</b> (not by him),
making it necessary that he do all his writing on an older iPad given to him by
his father. As many of you are academics with iPads, you know this is
impractical and sad – today he couldn’t even get the wireless printer to work
with the iPad.<br/><br/>
I would like to get Phil a laptop that he can actually depend on, which he can
use to do his work while helping his child. I think he’s pretty amazing to be
so devoted. Alas, I am fairly broke as well, though I will be contributing as
much as I can to this present.<br/><br/><b>
I will spend 100% of anything you give to buy the best possible computer I can
find, whether that means an older but functioning computer covered with Black
Sabbath stickers off the Craigslist, or a brand new state-of-the-art piece of
reverse engineered alien technology.</b><br/><br/>
I know that many of you know Phil and are friends with him, so even if all you
would ever do for him is buy him a burrito, it would be cool if you put the
burrito money towards this present. Maybe you would buy him a bottle of Veuve
Clicquot or a small chicken-shaped cookie jar… You could put that money towards
this as well.<br/><br/>
I use a laser engraver where I work; <b>if you contribute to this gift, I will
laser-engrave your name and anything you might wish to say to Phil on the
computer and send it to him for his birthday. </b>
That way he will always know how many people truly love him. <br/><br/><b>
If you share this, please hide your post from Phil, his family, and any friends
you suspect might tell Phil or his family. I want it to be a surprise. </b><br/><br/>
Thanks so much in advance. I know it is a lot to ask when so many people are
suffering in so many different ways, but I really know in my heart that it
would mean the world to him.</p>

<p>Today we´re having an appointment at our fine-art print service provider, to get your perks printed. </p>
<p>Next week we´ll start to ship them, but keep you informed with the exact date!</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support dear friends/backers. </p>
<p>We managed to get it done. The Atelier/Studio Room has been left in it´s old industrial charme and we fitted it out with ""cool daylight"" and a big board (9x6ft|3x2m) and started creating our first large scale stunning India Ink painting. </p>
<p>The Showroom is done as well. We got the flooring for a steal and applyed it our selves with help of a lady friend, the flooring looks awesome. The room &amp; doors, entrance and roof have been painted 3-5 times to get a pristine clean atmosphere for displaying our works. On the ceiling I installed a stunning lighting system we bought. It runs on LED´s and the color temperature is ""warm daylight"", it highlights everything perfectly and is easy to handle.</p>
<p>Our Office has been the first remodelled room, we some pieces of furniture a repeater and printer, everything is in it´s place by now.</p>
<p>""Tony"" our Studio/Atelier cat is enjoying the human company and constant petting, at night he sleeps inside and by day he´s on the ""hunt"" though our neighbor´s gardens.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jack-the-Flipper-Atelier-Showroom/248637241956005?ref=bookmarks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">We launched a FB Studio/Atelier page and document everything here</a>!</p>
<p>Thank you again for your kind support &amp; sharing of our journey, we are driven, more than every and will reach our goal. Stay tuned and befriend us to be on track with us. Best regards, </p>

Back in 2011 I (Sascha Hojzakowa) owned a store (with my BF) and Markus Brungs - he´s got a fine arts masters degree - was a customer. <br/></p>
<p>We started talking about both our passion photography, one thing let to another, so we spent the whole winter 2011-12 in the basement and started to shoot waterdrops. In the end we had built a professional waterdrop studio and took +10.000 pictures. Every single sculpture was different - I can tell you!</p>
<p><b>Impossible to reproduce - shot in a 10.000th of a second.</b> <br/></p>
<p>The obvious may hide an awesome spectacle - who knew - until JtF comes a long and unravels it. Flash yourself with our ""discovery"" - the visual impact is sensational: </p>

<p>We where more than impressed by the results we got from <b>hundreds of hours</b> of experimenting and shooting these sculptures.

<p>My BF and I spent 6,5y of our lives every day (6d/12h) to keep our store running &amp; to make the customers happy.....we somehow lost ourselves on the way. In 2012 we had to sell our store due to worse getting burnout sympthoms. I got cardiac arrhythmia, insomnia &amp; lost 50p. Uwe (my BF) got a ping-pong-ball size tumor, right under his ear in the salivary gland. </p>
<p>When he had to stay in the hospital (3 weeks), I couldn´t visit him just once because I had to run our business (aftermath: half his face including one ear is completely numb). Since december 2013 we are struggling financially. The buyer of our store isn´t paying the monthly rates anymore and already resold ""our"" business.</p>
<p>Without my nana - born christmas eve 1922 - we (Uwe &amp; Me) would be lost, she´s financing our lives with her pension. She prays for us everyday and deeply believes in our enterprise. All this wouldn´t be possible without her. She hardly survived the dark nazi times,  <b>I love you Nana!</b></p>

<h4><b>The Logo - 100% soul </b></h4>
<p>The conception &amp; creation of our logo took us 3 weeks and you´ll see, it was totally worth it, it combines everything we are. Before rendering it had 177 photoshop layers and was 2,7gb large. We put 100% of our soul &amp; love into everything we create!</p>

<h4>Our ""425.000$"" Online Shop - I´m not kidding</h4>
<p>And that isn´t fairly enough... Do the math friends. The daily rate of a newcomer photographer is (890€) 1180$, we are far beyond that, as you observed.  We worked 6 months to realize our design concept, capture all the pictures and fulfill all the business administration. That´ll add up to 424.800$. Wooooow.</p>
<p>Another calculation example: Below is a productphoto we shot for our online shop. 24 motifs we finalized - each captured with 220-300 different settings - that´s ± 5300 pictures we created, multiply them by let´s say 40$ each (incl. Studio, post processing) = 212.000$. Again. Wooooooooow.</p>
<p>You see, it isn´t really easy to put that in numbers.  It was our artistic vision. We wanted to create a shop where<b> we spend our money</b>. You can see, that we thought every part of it through. </p>
<p><b>It´s the realization of our vision, we dedicated all our heart &amp; soul into this project.</b> What do you think? </p>

<p>He was left behind, like a piece of furniture someone didn´t have a use for anymore. People are cruel. He doesn´t understand that. He was in a bad condition when we gave him shelter, saved him by feeding him twice daily, pet &amp; foster him everyday! ""Tony"" is a decent &amp; modest cat and he now depends on us. I´m highly allergic, that´s why he can´t stay inside our home, but in the studio there would be ""his"" place, may I remind you of the strongs winters here. We wont let him down. <br/></p>
<p>Besides that we shelter two guinny pigs (since 2011) we saved them from the animal shelter and they don´t fit together in one household with ""Tony"" that well :)<br/></p>

<h3>Why is failure not an option?</h3>
<p>For sure there´ll be set backs and lows, but what can I say, we always proceed and at last prevail. There are no obsticles or hurdles we wont climp. We are 3 dedicated artists &amp; entrepreneurs, every one is playing in his own field of expertise. Together we are strong and believe in us, we prooved it in our lifes. </p>
<p><b>We´ve come to far to fail with ""Jack the Flipper""!</b><br/></p>
<p>Everything can be lighter than it seems - we´re in our mid - late 30´s - we have the experience. Both in business and life. Corporate jobs and self-employed ventures made us solid. Illnesses in our close family (mostly cancer) welded us together. </p>
<p>I (Sascha) organized up to <b>6 hours of Live TV Broadcasting</b> (+120 Crew) and dealt with constant changes of the fixed shedule while on air coordinating all the different divisions to keep the show running and getting back on track. Nothing will work as planned, but I always have a plan upfront. So I know how to work under stress with immediate reacting on the circumstances. Always focussed.</p>
<p>We know our strenghts and flaws. We started with nothing, we faced banruptcy with our store 2 times, but always kept going, <b>without banks and their stinky money!</b> </p>
<p>No one and no thing can bring us down. </p>
<p><b>We are proud &amp; free of balasts. Join us &amp; together we can rise. </b></p>
<p>Together Uwe &amp; me moved 3 times, everytime we got rid of 50-70% of the stuff we possed. Right now we´re living on 500sq.ft. and have all in all 15 drawers. How many do you have? </p>
<p>We freed ourselves from posessions, because they posessed us. Our dream is that we can carry everything we need to own as carry-on luggage, of course the photography equipment goes extra ;)</p>

UPDATE:
Thank you all for your support dear friends/backers. 
We managed to get it done. The Atelier/Studio Room has been left in it´s old industrial charme and we fitted it out with ""cool daylight"" and a big board (9x6ft|3x2m) and started creating our first large scale stunning India Ink painting. 
The Showroom is done as well. We got the flooring for a steal and applyed it our selves with help of a lady friend, the flooring looks awesome. The room & doors, entrance and roof have been painted 3-5 times to get a pristine clean atmosphere for displaying our works. On the ceiling I installed a stunning lighting system we bought. It runs on LED´s and the color temperature is ""warm daylight"", it highlights everything perfectly and is easy to handle.
Our Office has been the first remodelled room, we some pieces of furniture a repeater and printer, everything is in it´s place by now.
""Tony"" our Studio/Atelier cat is enjoying the human company and constant petting, at night he sleeps inside and by day he´s on the ""hunt"" though our neighbor´s gardens.
We launched a FB Studio/Atelier page and document everything here!
Thank you again for your kind support & sharing of our journey, we are driven, more than every and will reach our goal. Stay tuned and befriend us to be on track with us. Best regards,

Jack the Flipper - Background  ""Jack the Flipper | Artwork & Photography"" evolved from a deep friendship and a deeper understanding of fine-arts. Back in 2011 I (Sascha Hojzakowa) owned a store (with my BF) and Markus Brungs - he´s got a fine arts masters degree - was a customer. 
We started talking about both our passion photography, one thing let to another, so we spent the whole winter 2011-12 in the basement and started to shoot waterdrops. In the end we had built a professional waterdrop studio and took +10.000 pictures. Every single sculpture was different - I can tell you!
Impossible to reproduce - shot in a 10.000th of a second. 
The obvious may hide an awesome spectacle - who knew - until JtF comes a long and unravels it. Flash yourself with our ""discovery"" - the visual impact is sensational: 

  
""Tutelum""                                  ""Aquanoxi Dancer""               ""Columna""
""Aqua Momentum"" we called this scientific series. 6 motifs are in this Edition. 


  ""Umbella""                                  ""Diadema""                                ""Achtfugit""
We where more than impressed by the results we got from hundreds of hours of experimenting and shooting these sculptures. It was a huge scientific project combined with our artistic vision of unraveling the mystery - uncapable for the human eye to observe - of such a common thing (to us industrialized nations) like water. In this case Waterdrops. 
Often the precious things lie directly in front of you, but if you look closely you can make it visible.
These are 100% photographys, no digital manipulation at all.

I feel to get personal for 2 mins to honor my nana


My BF and I spent 6,5y of our lives every day (6d/12h) to keep our store running & to make the customers happy.....we somehow lost ourselves on the way. In 2012 we had to sell our store due to worse getting burnout sympthoms. I got cardiac arrhythmia, insomnia & lost 50p. Uwe (my BF) got a ping-pong-ball size tumor, right under his ear in the salivary gland. 
When he had to stay in the hospital (3 weeks), I couldn´t visit him just once because I had to run our business (aftermath: half his face including one ear is completely numb). Since december 2013 we are struggling financially. The buyer of our store isn´t paying the monthly rates anymore and already resold ""our"" business.
Without my nana - born christmas eve 1922 - we (Uwe & Me) would be lost, she´s financing our lives with her pension. She prays for us everyday and deeply believes in our enterprise. All this wouldn´t be possible without her. She hardly survived the dark nazi times,  I love you Nana!



  Thats her & me (Sascha) 
You play the most important role to help us prospering. Its a timely matter.
The Logo - 100% soul 
The conception & creation of our logo took us 3 weeks and you´ll see, it was totally worth it, it combines everything we are. Before rendering it had 177 photoshop layers and was 2,7gb large. We put 100% of our soul & love into everything we create!




+67.000€ we invested until today in living expenses, equipment, photo projects, health insurance and printing our works and keep it all running. Yes €, not $. (most part on Markus, he owns all the equipment) 
Each accomplishment, we created/reached by ourselves, e.g. Logos, layout, design, post production, publishing, public relations, etc. 
However our clock is ticking, we maxed out our budget and by the end of the year we have to earn money. Or we will loose everything. Even our home. Seriously.
There is our plain & structured website, blog & social media with published new works nourished daily with stunning accompanying texts by Uwe (top expert).
The composition & development (of our works) account for our backgound as classical studied painters, regard the classical definition of fine-arts.

Godafoss Herd of Horses 1 | Iceland (by fluke this herd passed by - see more...)Yoda says: ""Social Proof you have""
All online stuff we have fulfilled so far, Uwe nurses daily (flickr, g+, FB, instagram, 500px, fotocommunity, blog, homepage, shop and answering every question)
The social media feedback we receive is overwhelming.

+2.000.000 hits on our G+ must mean we have social proof!

 
De Val 1 | Netherlands (G+)  +478               Flower 37 | Flower (tumblr) +1041

Our ""425.000$"" Online Shop - I´m not kidding
And that isn´t fairly enough... Do the math friends. The daily rate of a newcomer photographer is (890€) 1180$, we are far beyond that, as you observed.  We worked 6 months to realize our design concept, capture all the pictures and fulfill all the business administration. That´ll add up to 424.800$. Wooooow.
Another calculation example: Below is a productphoto we shot for our online shop. 24 motifs we finalized - each captured with 220-300 different settings - that´s ± 5300 pictures we created, multiply them by let´s say 40$ each (incl. Studio, post processing) = 212.000$. Again. Wooooooooow.
You see, it isn´t really easy to put that in numbers.  It was our artistic vision. We wanted to create a shop where we spend our money. You can see, that we thought every part of it through. 
It´s the realization of our vision, we dedicated all our heart & soul into this project. What do you think?

During this product shot the ice kept melting and melting, turning everything into a constant mess.  We mopped up the water to get the set pristine again and again, and....we wanted to reflect the feeling of ICELAND :-)

So far we have created nearly 8 TB of data for ""Jack the Flipper"", this split up into +33.000 files organized in +22.000 folders. I told you, every itsy-bitsy mosaic piece WE created. 
You see, we are pushing ourselves or are we going insane? Hahaha... :)

""Jack the Flipper"" is an officially licensed business in the offline world, too.
In an upscale hairsalon we´re already on display with 10 of our works +10 ready to frame archival prints in a display (see below), this investment alone was 1175$ for us.

We don´t trust the system - so let´s hack it :) 
We worked with galerists etc., but we don´t trust the ""old"" system, we want to hack it - thanks Timothy Ferriss :)  Rely on yourself. So do we.


 Markus & Sascha

We are proud. We follow our vision. We work hard. Do you see we are driven?!

Art Cologne | Fine arts market proof - we got!
Before JtF - when Markus created unique fine-art works - he sold +12 paintings (5.000€ & up). One was sold even before ""ArtCologne 2006"" opened for 6.500€. ""The World our Dream | 2007"" took a month to create and has never been offered for sale - it reflects the profound understanding of Markus in technique and creativity. It´s 3D painted in oil-on-chalk-on-canvas-on-wood, he has been taught this craft by his Prof. Nikolaj Fedkovic who sold these apiece for high five-figures. Since this was 8 years ago - everyone forgot. 
Starting in late September 2014 we´ll create large scale artworks in our Atelier.
This gets us back on the art market and our Perks become valuable collectibles. Promised!

Above: Coloring the 3D letters - can you read the poem - it´s in german :)



Above: final work ""The World our Dream |  2007"" - the whole work is in 3D - but the effect is hardly visible on these photos.

There is so much more to tell about us....but I have to cut to the chase. 

Project - Atelier - Background
We require an Atelier | Studio. We need to shake the market with our works. We have to act. You play the crucial part here dear backers. Please act now. 
The place has an industrial character and huge potential to start our offline enterprise, it´s about 700sq.ft, however it needs urgent remodelling. We got the keys and already started with heavy cleaning, preparations and painting. 
What can you do there?



creative workspace for Markus, Uwe & Sascha

create new Artworks again (century old skillful techniques which we master)
starting late September with a new Edition of large scale Artworks
execute new scientific photo projects 
host accompanying workshops

picture framing services

free workshops & events for the not so fortunate (req. washing room/see stretch goals) 
host Art Dinners with local bands/DJ´s (req. washing room)
hold competitions

offer Internships for students (req. washing room)

encounter with you & show our works
see workflow, insights and backgrounds of our world

share our knowledge & we boost your skills


explain our equipment
the place where you can pet our atelier cat ""Tony"" :)

You can put us on the map and make us real. You only have the force!

Your support is vital to the success of this campaign, we take every risk to realize our venture, we know our strengths, we´ve worked so much and won´t back down. Never. 
We follow our dream & passion and you be the crucial part, our funding-fathers. 
Big Inspirer
Peter Lik is a legend! He´s an big inspirer and a self made man. That´s what we adore about him. He´s living proof. We have a lot in common - apart from him already beeing on the summit. Just follow your path. You can only be free, if you free yourself from contraints put on you by others. 
Every progress we´ll document every on our social-media profiles. 
Further assurance for YOU: Our business ia laywered up by Thoms & Hugl
""Tony"" the abandoned cat  
He was left behind, like a piece of furniture someone didn´t have a use for anymore. People are cruel. He doesn´t understand that. He was in a bad condition when we gave him shelter, saved him by feeding him twice daily, pet & foster him everyday! ""Tony"" is a decent & modest cat and he now depends on us. I´m highly allergic, that´s why he can´t stay inside our home, but in the studio there would be ""his"" place, may I remind you of the strongs winters here. We wont let him down. 
Besides that we shelter two guinny pigs (since 2011) we saved them from the animal shelter and they don´t fit together in one household with ""Tony"" that well :)

The Impact of what you give and will get back 

We are asking you to help us raise the princely sum of 11.497,50$. Over 67.000€ we invested and we have to make a living wage soon. 
The most important point is, this isn´t a charity fund-raiser. This is your chance to own one of these great works at a great saving. For every amazing supporter of our venture we created highly collectible works. We are grateful and deeply happy about being self employed. You help us being free again, so we have to give something of great value back. Every perk is calculated low, that your only chance to get them is here. (e.g. ""Early Bird"" limited Edition 199$ instead shop price 642$)
All Perks include worldwide shipping & are limited Editions dear friends!We need the 11.497,50$ for:
paint for walls & ceilings (materials & incidentials) 800$

setting up drywalls 775$
install basic track & spot light system 2250$
3 large acryl glass mounted prints (each 775$) 2325$
2 desks, shelves, chairs, small counter (all second hand!) ± 475$
install smoke pipe for chimney or compensates the heating cost for 1.st winter ± 2500$
Fees 4% & transaction 3% & taxes 19% will add up to 2372,50$ - what a bummer :( 

 The savings from my nana keep depleting and she´s 91 already. She deserves to see our finished atelier for her 92 B´day on 12/24/2014 and this can just work if you believe in my complete honesty. 
The expenses for pizzas & beers for our helping hands and maintaining the studio will be covered be us. :)

  Business Proof
In 2005 me & Uwe (my BF) where offered to take over a sinking video rental store, we where given 14 days to decide. I was Producer for public TV and Uwe (also corporate) branch manager of a store. We had so little time, no experience, help or assets, but deep down we knew, just working self-employed would fulfill ourselves. Everyone disadvised us! Yet 7 days later we stood in our store and signed a contract of paying 245.000$ takeover price + 370.000$ in rent over 6,5 years. We started from scratch and managed it all. With 72h/week we where burned out (read above) and had to sell in 2012. We had to agree to monthly rates, and this is breaking our necks now. Because the phoney we sold to isn´t paying us anymore, last payment was X-mas 2013. He´s is trying to ruin us. But we don´t give up. We have a lawyer, no one can break us. 



Last day @ our store: Sascha, Matthew & Uwe | 5/31/2012 (When we didn´t see all that coming...)
Why is failure not an option?
For sure there´ll be set backs and lows, but what can I say, we always proceed and at last prevail. There are no obsticles or hurdles we wont climp. We are 3 dedicated artists & entrepreneurs, every one is playing in his own field of expertise. Together we are strong and believe in us, we prooved it in our lifes. 
We´ve come to far to fail with ""Jack the Flipper""!
Everything can be lighter than it seems - we´re in our mid - late 30´s - we have the experience. Both in business and life. Corporate jobs and self-employed ventures made us solid. Illnesses in our close family (mostly cancer) welded us together. 
I (Sascha) organized up to 6 hours of Live TV Broadcasting (+120 Crew) and dealt with constant changes of the fixed shedule while on air coordinating all the different divisions to keep the show running and getting back on track. Nothing will work as planned, but I always have a plan upfront. So I know how to work under stress with immediate reacting on the circumstances. Always focussed.
We know our strenghts and flaws. We started with nothing, we faced banruptcy with our store 2 times, but always kept going, without banks and their stinky money! 
No one and no thing can bring us down. 
We are proud & free of balasts. Join us & together we can rise. 
Together Uwe & me moved 3 times, everytime we got rid of 50-70% of the stuff we possed. Right now we´re living on 500sq.ft. and have all in all 15 drawers. How many do you have? 
We freed ourselves from posessions, because they posessed us. Our dream is that we can carry everything we need to own as carry-on luggage, of course the photography equipment goes extra ;)
Our Biographys

Share our journey if you feel confident - you count! More valuable than money is getting us THE contact!!
Maybe you can connect us with an influencer (Art collector, reporter, blogger, etc.) - than we will grant you a wish!!
Please use the Indiegogo sharing tool, that would be awesome it helps spread the word of our art enterprise, every click counts for us. May you be blessed with our eternal gratitude. 
Thank you for listening, affectionate regards Sascha Hojzakowa | Jack the Flipper

Currently we are seeking properties in which to set up studio spaces in Glasgow and are planning a programme of pop-up exhibitions and 
public engagement activities across Scotland.What we aim to do!

We will aim to provide groups of artists with generously sized studio spaces at affordable prices, with support to develop their practice through self-direction, group crits and skill share.Simultaneously we will be inviting emerging artists from across the country to become members of VAU for opportunities to gain professional development experience through exhibiting their work and engaging with the wider community. Through our public engagement programme member artists will be invited to deliver talks and facilitate classes, workshops and skill share sessions in order to help make contemporary art more accessible for all. We also want to be able to pay artists for their services in support of  a-n's Paying Artists Campaign.How can you help?We need initial funds in order to:
Buy tools, equipment and materials for building and installing partitions to divide our premises into separate studio spaces
Buy tables, chairs, storage lockers and other equipment for artists studios
Pay for planning costs and venue hire fees to host a range of pop-up exhibitions and public engagement activities such as talks and workshops across Scotland.

Already we have an exhibition and artists discussion event organised for the Old Hairdresser's, Glasgow, 24th/25th August, and are currently seeking venues to host our first public art workshops.Why should you help?While we have been applying for funding through the likes of First Port and Creative Scotland, there are waits of up to 12 weeks to hear back with no guarantee of being successful. We want to have studio spaces and a planned programme of exhibitions, workshops and talks up and running as soon as possible, particularly in time to support the new wave of graduating 
artists this summer. As recent graduate artists ourselves, we understand
 the urgent need for exhibition and professional development 
opportunities immediately upon graduating, as well as the impact a
 sudden loss of studio space, production facilities and peer support can
 have on the development of artists' work, particularly at a time when 
these things are most needed!

<br/><h3>THE BOOK</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Antonio Fernández (Piqui) is a member of the Cursed Monkeys Corp with a very particular view on modeling. He wants to tell little stories with his figures and vignettes. That's the reason why his works go beyond a simple figure. He had a yearning to write a book to help all hobbyists who wanted to move from being simply a painter to being a complete modeler who not only paints figures but can also fix them, make conversions, build terrain and, in the end, has got all the tools to TELL STORIES in miniature; and finally he got around to writing it. And of course, the rest of his teammates from the Cursed Monkeys Corp have contributed as much as possible.</p>
<p>For those who don't know us, the Cursed Monkeys Corp was born some time ago as a group of friends with a common hobby, modeling, who wanted to share their work with other people. What sets us apart from the rest is that we have a slightly different view of the hobby.</p>
<p>For us, the story is the heart of the hobby, so we try to create scenes which are a setting to tell something.</p>
<p>We started as enthusiastic hobbyists with several years of experience who wanted to go a small step beyond, building small scenes with meaning in the beginning, but now we make complex and richly detailed scenes, both big and small. We have grown ourselves, hand in hand with our work, so right now three of us work professionally in the modeling business.</p>
<p>In this book we all have worked under Antonio Fernandez's leadership, as contributors to the first monograph not focused solely on painting or sculpting, but on the whole creative process.</p>
<p>This book is for all hobbyists – painters, sculptors, modelers – who practice several aspects of the hobby. It deals with techniques from the basic, like cleaning and pinning the figure, to the advanced, like portrait sculpting. In this book, the hobbyist will find a plethora of help and advice, and also complete, step-by-step sculpting procedures illustrated with more than 500 pictures of Antonio Fernandez's (Piquifl) work, and from his teammates in the Cursed Monkeys Corp modeling group too.</p>
<p>And now we need your help to make it real.</p>

<p><font color=""grey""><i>Antonio Fernandez (Piqui) es un miembro mas de los The Cursed Monkeys Corp, con una visión muy particular del modelismo. El quiere contar pequeñas historias con sus figuras y escenas. Esa es la razón por la que sus obras, transmiten algo más que una simple figura. Uno de sus anhelos era escribir un libro con la intención de prestar una ayuda a todo aficionado que quiera pasar de ser un pintor a un modelista completo, que no solo pinta figuras, sino que es capaz de arreglarlas, conversionarlas, crear un terreno y, en definitiva, tiene todas las herramientas para CONTAR HISTORIAS, y por fin se animo a escribirlo. Y, por supuesto, el resto de compañeros de los Cursed Monkeys Corp, hemos colaborado en todo lo posible.</i></font></p>
<p><font color=""grey""><i>Para los que no nos conozcáis The Cursed Monkeys Corp nació hace algún tiempo como un grupo de amigos con un hobby en común, el modelismo, que pretendía compartir su trabajo con otra gente. Lo que nos hace diferentes del resto es que tenemos una visión ligeramente distinta del hobby que la habitual.</i></font></p>
<p><font color=""grey""><i>
Para nosotros la historia es el núcleo del hobby así que intentamos crear escenas que sean un escenario para contar algo. Empezamos como aficionados entusiastas con varios años de experiencia que querían dar un pequeño paso más allá construyendo pequeñas escenas con significado al principio, para ahora construir escenas muy complejas y ricas en detalles tanto grandes como pequeñas.. Nosotros mismos crecimos a la par que nuestros proyectos de forma que tres de nosotros somos profesionales del sector en estos momentos.</i></font></p>
<p><font color=""grey""><i>
En este libro hemos trabajado todos bajo el liderazgo de Antonio Fernández como colaboradores de su libro para crear el primer monográfico que no esta enfocado ni a pintura ni a escultura, sino al proceso creativo completo.</i></font></p>
<p><font color=""grey""><i>Este libro está dirigido a todos los aficionados, ya sean pintores, escultores, o modelistas  que practican varias facetas del hobby. En el se ha incluido desde técnicas básicas, como el proceso de limpieza y sujeción de la figura, hasta técnicas avanzadas de modelismo como la escultura de retratos. En este libro, el aficionado encontrará, multitud de consejos y ayudas, así como procesos completos y paso a paso de escultura, ilustrados con más de 500 fotografías de  procesos y trabajos de Antonio Fernández (Piquifl), y del resto del grupo ""The Cursed Monkey Corp"".<br/></i></font></p>

<h3>WHAT DO WE NEED?</h3>
<p></p><p>Our goal is to have the book published, nothing else.</p><p>We have worked very hard during the last year to write the book, which is completely finished, <b>in two different editions, Spanish and English</b>. It will be a full-color, DIN A4 format, near 150 pages long book which will include several chapters where Antonio Fernández explains how our projects are born in his mind and go through the whole creative process.</p><p>Inside you will find brainstorming, design, concept sketching, sculpting, composition, painting, terrain, step-by-step... THE WHOLE PROCESS DESCRIBED IN DEPTH</p><p>Given that <b>Antonio Fernández (Piqui)</b> is the main writer, most of the chapters have been written by him, but there are contributions by:</p><p></p>

<h3>How can you help us?</h3>
<p></p><p>We'll be glad if you like our idea and want to purchase a book. But first let us explain our planning:</p><p>The campaign will be online from November the 20th to December the 18th. During this time we will be giving the finishing touches to the book and the goals. Allow us to insist in the fact that <b>the book is already written in Spanish and the English edition is about to be delivered by a professional translator we have hired.</b></p><p>Once the campaign ends, if we reach our goal, we will begin with the final paperwork. We will contact each of you to check both shipping and billing information. It's very important for us that you give that information if you want the book to arrive home safe and sound. <b>At this point we will ask you wich languaje do you prefer, Spanish or English.</b></p><p>At the same time we will contact the printing company – which is already arranged – to confirm the books. We also will buy boxes and prepare postal labels to send the parcels.</p><p>We will have the book proofs by the first fortnight of January, 2014. Once the final corrections are made, we hope to have the final version of both books by the end of January.</p><p>We will ship all orders beginning on February the 1st, so you can have it at home that very same month. So, if you still want to help. We offer you the following options:</p><p></p>

<h3>Which are the risk on this campaign?</h3>
<p></p><p>Well, obviously the biggest risk is a delay at some point, so that if something goes really wrong you may have the book in your hands by March or April. We don't think that's likely, because we have done our homework before starting this campaign and the book is already written. But the risk is always there.</p><p>Another risk is the book getting lost in the postal service. This wouldn't be our fault, but if it happens we will try our best to locate your book.</p><p>We are going to need some information for the invoices. Spanish law suggest us that both buyer and seller be identified by a unique number: DNI or CIF in Spain, VAT in Europe for companies, SSN or Company Number in the USA, TFN in Australia, Codice Fiscali in Italy, Tax Number in the UK... and of course, passport number will alwais work. If you are not confortable giving this number please not this is an optional requirement, but highly reccomended. We will ask you for this information together with your name and address when the campaign ends, because Indiegogo doesn't have an option to get them during the campaign. If somebody doesn't send us all the information by December the 31st, we'll make a refund and won't send the book.</p><p>Of course there may be a risk we haven´t thought of...</p><p></p>
<p><font color=""grey""><i>Bueno obviamente el mayor riego es el de un retraso en algún punto del calendario, de forma que si algo sale rematadamente mal tendrás el libro en tu casa en marzo o abril. no esperamos que pase algo así porque hemos hecho nuestros deberes antes de lanzar la campaña y el libro ya está escrito, pero el riesgo por supuesto existe.</i></font></p>
<p><i><font color=""grey""></font></i></p><p><font color=""grey""><i>Otro riesgo es que el libro se pierda en correos. Esto no es culpa nuestra pero si pasa haremos lo posible por localizar vuestro libro.</i></font></p>
<p><font color=""grey""><i>Vamos a necesitar algunos datos para completar las facturas. la ley española sugiere que tanto el vendedor como el comprador estén identificados en la factura con un número de identificación único. (DNI o CIF en España, VAT en Europa para empresas, SSN o Company Number en Estados Unidos, TFN en Australia, Codice Fiscali en Italia, Tax Number en Inglaterra, etc... o en cualquier caso, el pasaporte mismo. A pesar de que este es un requerimiento opcional, es altamente recomendable proporcionarlo) Os preguntaremos estos datos junto con vuestro nombre y dirección de envío al finalizar la campaña dado que Indiegogo no nos facilita una herramienta para recopilarlos durante la campaña. si alguno no nos envía los datos correctamente cumplimentados antes del 31 de diciembre le haremos un reembolso y no le enviaremos el libro.</i></font></p>

</div>","THE BOOK

Antonio Fernández (Piqui) is a member of the Cursed Monkeys Corp with a very particular view on modeling. He wants to tell little stories with his figures and vignettes. That's the reason why his works go beyond a simple figure. He had a yearning to write a book to help all hobbyists who wanted to move from being simply a painter to being a complete modeler who not only paints figures but can also fix them, make conversions, build terrain and, in the end, has got all the tools to TELL STORIES in miniature; and finally he got around to writing it. And of course, the rest of his teammates from the Cursed Monkeys Corp have contributed as much as possible.
For those who don't know us, the Cursed Monkeys Corp was born some time ago as a group of friends with a common hobby, modeling, who wanted to share their work with other people. What sets us apart from the rest is that we have a slightly different view of the hobby.
For us, the story is the heart of the hobby, so we try to create scenes which are a setting to tell something.
We started as enthusiastic hobbyists with several years of experience who wanted to go a small step beyond, building small scenes with meaning in the beginning, but now we make complex and richly detailed scenes, both big and small. We have grown ourselves, hand in hand with our work, so right now three of us work professionally in the modeling business.
In this book we all have worked under Antonio Fernandez's leadership, as contributors to the first monograph not focused solely on painting or sculpting, but on the whole creative process.
This book is for all hobbyists – painters, sculptors, modelers – who practice several aspects of the hobby. It deals with techniques from the basic, like cleaning and pinning the figure, to the advanced, like portrait sculpting. In this book, the hobbyist will find a plethora of help and advice, and also complete, step-by-step sculpting procedures illustrated with more than 500 pictures of Antonio Fernandez's (Piquifl) work, and from his teammates in the Cursed Monkeys Corp modeling group too.
And now we need your help to make it real.



Antonio Fernandez (Piqui) es un miembro mas de los The Cursed Monkeys Corp, con una visión muy particular del modelismo. El quiere contar pequeñas historias con sus figuras y escenas. Esa es la razón por la que sus obras, transmiten algo más que una simple figura. Uno de sus anhelos era escribir un libro con la intención de prestar una ayuda a todo aficionado que quiera pasar de ser un pintor a un modelista completo, que no solo pinta figuras, sino que es capaz de arreglarlas, conversionarlas, crear un terreno y, en definitiva, tiene todas las herramientas para CONTAR HISTORIAS, y por fin se animo a escribirlo. Y, por supuesto, el resto de compañeros de los Cursed Monkeys Corp, hemos colaborado en todo lo posible.
Para los que no nos conozcáis The Cursed Monkeys Corp nació hace algún tiempo como un grupo de amigos con un hobby en común, el modelismo, que pretendía compartir su trabajo con otra gente. Lo que nos hace diferentes del resto es que tenemos una visión ligeramente distinta del hobby que la habitual.

Para nosotros la historia es el núcleo del hobby así que intentamos crear escenas que sean un escenario para contar algo. Empezamos como aficionados entusiastas con varios años de experiencia que querían dar un pequeño paso más allá construyendo pequeñas escenas con significado al principio, para ahora construir escenas muy complejas y ricas en detalles tanto grandes como pequeñas.. Nosotros mismos crecimos a la par que nuestros proyectos de forma que tres de nosotros somos profesionales del sector en estos momentos.

En este libro hemos trabajado todos bajo el liderazgo de Antonio Fernández como colaboradores de su libro para crear el primer monográfico que no esta enfocado ni a pintura ni a escultura, sino al proceso creativo completo.
Este libro está dirigido a todos los aficionados, ya sean pintores, escultores, o modelistas  que practican varias facetas del hobby. En el se ha incluido desde técnicas básicas, como el proceso de limpieza y sujeción de la figura, hasta técnicas avanzadas de modelismo como la escultura de retratos. En este libro, el aficionado encontrará, multitud de consejos y ayudas, así como procesos completos y paso a paso de escultura, ilustrados con más de 500 fotografías de  procesos y trabajos de Antonio Fernández (Piquifl), y del resto del grupo ""The Cursed Monkey Corp"".
Ahora necesitamos vuestra ayuda para hacerlo real.
WHAT DO WE NEED?
Our goal is to have the book published, nothing else.We have worked very hard during the last year to write the book, which is completely finished, in two different editions, Spanish and English. It will be a full-color, DIN A4 format, near 150 pages long book which will include several chapters where Antonio Fernández explains how our projects are born in his mind and go through the whole creative process.Inside you will find brainstorming, design, concept sketching, sculpting, composition, painting, terrain, step-by-step... THE WHOLE PROCESS DESCRIBED IN DEPTHGiven that Antonio Fernández (Piqui) is the main writer, most of the chapters have been written by him, but there are contributions by:



Javier González (Arsies Studio)

Alex Varela (Iguazzu)
Cristina Menéndez 
Francisco Gil Pavón
María Fernández
Luis Gómez Pradal
Antonio Fernández Ortíz
Although our main goal is to make the book become a reality, we want to make it even better if it's possible. Help us and we'll try to help you.And if we don't reach our goal your contribution will be refunded, so you are not risking your money.

Nuestra meta es publicar el libro. Nada más.
Hemos trabajado muy duro a lo largo de este último año para escribir el libro, que esta completamente terminado, en dos ediciones distintas, en español y en inglés. Será un libro en formato A4 a todo color y de cerca de 150 páginas que incluirá diversos capítulos donde Antonio Fernández explica como nuestros proyectos nacen en su mente y pasan por todo el proceso creativo.
Vas a encontrar desde tormenta de ideas , diseño, abocetado conceptual, escultura, composición, pintura, terrenos, pasos a paso, etc... EL PROCESO COMPLETO DESCRITO EN PROFUNDIDAD.Dado que el autor principal del libro es Antonio Fernández (Piqui) la mayor parte de los capitulos han sido escritos por él, pero ha contado con la participación de:

Javier González (Arsies Studio)
Alex Varela (Iguazzu)
Cristina Menéndez
Francisco Gil Pavón

During this time we will be giving the finishing touches to the book and the goals. Allow us to insist in the fact that the book is already written in Spanish and the English edition is about to be delivered by a professional translator we have hired.Once the campaign ends, if we reach our goal, we will begin with the final paperwork. We will contact each of you to check both shipping and billing information. It's very important for us that you give that information if you want the book to arrive home safe and sound. At this point we will ask you wich languaje do you prefer, Spanish or English.At the same time we will contact the printing company – which is already arranged – to confirm the books. We also will buy boxes and prepare postal labels to send the parcels.We will have the book proofs by the first fortnight of January, 2014. Once the final corrections are made, we hope to have the final version of both books by the end of January.We will ship all orders beginning on February the 1st, so you can have it at home that very same month.

Which are the risk on this campaign?
Well, obviously the biggest risk is a delay at some point, so that if something goes really wrong you may have the book in your hands by March or April. We don't think that's likely, because we have done our homework before starting this campaign and the book is already written. But the risk is always there.Another risk is the book getting lost in the postal service. This wouldn't be our fault, but if it happens we will try our best to locate your book.We are going to need some information for the invoices. Spanish law suggest us that both buyer and seller be identified by a unique number: DNI or CIF in Spain, VAT in Europe for companies, SSN or Company Number in the USA, TFN in Australia, Codice Fiscali in Italy, Tax Number in the UK... and of course, passport number will alwais work. If you are not confortable giving this number please not this is an optional requirement, but highly reccomended. We will ask you for this information together with your name and address when the campaign ends, because Indiegogo doesn't have an option to get them during the campaign. If somebody doesn't send us all the information by December the 31st, we'll make a refund and won't send the book.Of course there may be a risk we haven´t thought of...
Bueno obviamente el mayor riego es el de un retraso en algún punto del calendario, de forma que si algo sale rematadamente mal tendrás el libro en tu casa en marzo o abril. no esperamos que pase algo así porque hemos hecho nuestros deberes antes de lanzar la campaña y el libro ya está escrito, pero el riesgo por supuesto existe.
Otro riesgo es que el libro se pierda en correos. Esto no es culpa nuestra pero si pasa haremos lo posible por localizar vuestro libro.
Vamos a necesitar algunos datos para completar las facturas. la ley española sugiere que tanto el vendedor como el comprador estén identificados en la factura con un número de identificación único. (DNI o CIF en España, VAT en Europa para empresas, SSN o Company Number en Estados Unidos, TFN en Australia, Codice Fiscali en Italia, Tax Number en Inglaterra, etc... o en cualquier caso, el pasaporte mismo. A pesar de que este es un requerimiento opcional, es altamente recomendable proporcionarlo) Os preguntaremos estos datos junto con vuestro nombre y dirección de envío al finalizar la campaña dado que Indiegogo no nos facilita una herramienta para recopilarlos durante la campaña. si alguno no nos envía los datos correctamente cumplimentados antes del 31 de diciembre le haremos un reembolso y no le enviaremos el libro.
Por supuesto puede existir algún riesgo en el que no hayamos pensado.

I have big ideas for my future and I would like to plan an art show for Winter of 2015.

<p>Some of us are too young to remember, but there was an exiting time when computers were not yet part of everyday life. The Nerd Dreams Calendar 2013 will bring to you the machines that led the digital revolution, long before the smartphones and the tablets of our day and age. </p>
<p>C64, Amiga, Atari ST, Mac SE were among the melodious names that changed our lives for ever. (The calendar even features the only line of computers produced in the former socialist Germany, the German Democratic Republic GDR, the Robotron KC 87!)</p>
<p>To operate these machines, you needed to know how! Remember 5 1/4 inch floppy disks and command prompts? The beeping modems and slow connections? Matrix printers and fanfold paper?</p>
<p>As a result, a class of computer nerds formed. Call them geeks or even dorks, they paved the way to the all the digital pleasures that make our lives so much richer today! To remember both the early computers and the nerds operating them, I want to produce the Nerd Dreams Calenders 2013.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Current Status of the Calendar: Half way there already!!!</strong></h2>
<p>Together with Photo-Queen Anna, our make-up artist Ramona and stylist Domenica (and alongside my nerdy buddies Roman and Jan), I already pre-produced the first six pictures. As you can see, quality is superb! It is 'Made in Germany' afterall.</p>
<p>Now, I only need six more pictures and money for printing. To this end, I would like your help to make nerd dreams come true. You can preorder for merely $30, which includes shipping fees. Arrival in time for the holiday season is guaranteed! Wouldn't it be the perfect gift to a nerd a near you? </p>

<h3>Pentaphilia</h3>
<p>Pentaphilia is a large climbable art project, and an ode to the number five. It will be made up of 125 (5<sup>3</sup>) frames, each comprised of two 8-foot pentagons fused at an edge, floating on two large metal rings. The pentagons are large enough to walk through upright (for persons under 6' tall), and spiral around each other in a double-helical Mobius loop. The loop will be enter-able at five openings, with a series of five pentagonal steps to aid entry and exit. Each double-pentagon frame will be illuminated by strips of individually-addressable LEDs (five to an edge), producing a vibrant and high visible light show spanning several thousand points.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>The build team planning Pentaphilia was responsible for bringing Inflection to Burning Man in 2015, a hand-made wood and rope suspension bridge with a unique twist in the center. Building Inflection was extremely time-consuming, but worth all the toil when we watched people enjoy conquering our creation on-playa, and watching its eventual immolation.

<h3>Building it</h3>
<p>Our main expenses for this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood for the pentagons,</li>
<li>Steel rail to support them,</li>
<li>Lights and controllers to illuminate them, and</li>
<li>Transportation to move them</li>
</ul>
<p>All of our design and fabrication is being done by our crew in the Seattle area. Though we have our fingers crossed that we can raise enough money to build the whole thing, we are also planning for a smaller installation at Critical NW. This smaller installation will be one fifth of the project, in a straight line as opposed to a toroid. We hope that through this fundraiser, and others that we are planning locally, that we can bring the full-scale project to Burning Man 2017, where we can burn it at the end of the week.</p>
<p>We have already completed 23 build sessions: designing and testing all joints, ensuring strength through failure testing, building prototypes, and streamlining our build process so that we can complete the project in time.</p>

<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We have designed and machined custom pendants, scale models of our double-pentagons. These are made of aluminum and hand-polished, so they're strong and yet incredibly light and smooth. They're available with and without hanger loops. We're still working on the design for the stickers and patches, and the postcard will have to wait until we've actually built the project. We can't wait!</p>

Pentaphilia is a large climbable art project, and an ode to the number five. It will be made up of 125 (53) frames, each comprised of two 8-foot pentagons fused at an edge, floating on two large metal rings. The pentagons are large enough to walk through upright (for persons under 6' tall), and spiral around each other in a double-helical Mobius loop. The loop will be enter-able at five openings, with a series of five pentagonal steps to aid entry and exit. Each double-pentagon frame will be illuminated by strips of individually-addressable LEDs (five to an edge), producing a vibrant and high visible light show spanning several thousand points.

Why?
The build team planning Pentaphilia was responsible for bringing Inflection to Burning Man in 2015, a hand-made wood and rope suspension bridge with a unique twist in the center. Building Inflection was extremely time-consuming, but worth all the toil when we watched people enjoy conquering our creation on-playa, and watching its eventual immolation. We want to repeat this experience with Pentaphilia, but we need your help.

More of Hank's Inflection photos can be seen here.
Your contributions will make Pentaphilia a reality for roughly 1,000 people at Critical NW, and roughly 70,000 people at Burning Man 2017. Otherwise, it stays on the drawing board.

<p>Hello! My name is Alida Carlson and I am a mixed media artist currently pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design at the University of Minnesota. I consider myself a curious and creative soul, constantly seeking new experiences, new challenges, and opportunities that will help me grow as an individual and as a creative thinker. I am proud to say that for the time I have spent on this planet, I have always been committed to the creative process and have lived a life of expression and exploration in the form of visual art. I think ART IS POWER and can be used as a tool to expand young minds and challenge their way of thinking.</p>
<p>For the last year, I have been developing the details of my journey to Tamale, Ghana. I will be traveling with two other artists, Bryn and Kora Gleason. Bryn has a fine art background, specializing in intalgio printmaking. She recently graduated with a BFA from the University of Minnesota. Kora is a phenomenal apparel designer and is finalizing her BFA at the University of Minnesota. We are going on behalf of a truly unique non-profit organization called Brilliant Future International, founded by Minneapolis born, Alita Watson.</p>
<p>Alita explains, ""This is your rare opportunity to make a contribution that will change a young girl’s life, with confidence that every penny will be used as promised. I have personally spent time with each and every one of these girls, assessing their individual needs as young woman in Ghana, who are brilliant but unprivileged in so many regards.""</p>
<p>Often times, these girls are one step away from receiving an education. BFI works to discover what each individual girl needs in order to be a successful student. Often times, that might be a new pair of shoes. Or, for the girls that live 10 miles outside of Tamale, a bicycle so that they can get to school more efficiently. </p>
<p>What I aim to do is provide these young girls with the opportunity to express themselves as individuals and create art that inspires them and instigates self-exploration!

founded in 2004 and based in Lyon, France. We work on many different human

conflict resolution projects. The Festival builds off our Theatre for Peace
projects we've implemented since 2009 with our local partner KOW Media, based
in Hargeisa, Somaliland. The Theatre for Peace Road Show program aimed at
helping people address conflict using Drama for Conflict Transformation (DCT)
methods that combine theatre, debate and poetry to create a “safe space” for
exploring incendiary issues such as religion, clan and tribal conflicts, female
genital mutilation (FGM), domestic violence, human rights... The program built
on KOW Media’s work through its “Geediga Nabada” Peace Caravan team of trained
theatre practitioners. DCT is a rich methodology that encourages improvisation
and play to help participants develop new views and behaviours. IREX Europe
specialists worked with the theatre troupe to help them incorporate DCT techniques
in their performances. In situations of entrenched conflict, where debate and
historical analysis is rare and often leads itself to conflict, DCT unlocks the
creative power of individuals and communities to adopt new perspectives and
develop novel solutions to local problems. Not only is DCT a powerful tool for
transforming attitudes, it also provides a platform for practicing conflict
resolution strategies. <br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/591261/files/20140520010801-IREX_logo_v2.jpg?1400573281"" src="""" style=""width: 427.269px; height: 183px;""/></p><b>IREX</b> - IREX is our big sister organisation, our 'network partner'

It's Foundation, a non-profit entity, has been working on civic education and
engagement work in Somaliland and South Central for many years. The staff at
KOW Media, inspired by their Director, run the foundation because they believe
in a peaceful future for the Somali people. The last IREX Europe and KOW Media
project ended in 2012 with the first Somali Peace Festival - Film, Photo and
Art and was a success Somalilanders are still talking about today. KMC wants to
make the Festival annual, establishing a major cultural event in Hargeisa that
could pave the way for more stability and peace in the region. IREX Europe and
IREX are dedicated to supporting KMC in this process and making the Somali
Peace Festival a regular, successful event for all Somalis.

<h3><br/></h3><h3><b>What is
the Somali Peace Festival?</b></h3>
<p><b>The Somali Peace Festival - Film, Photo and Art</b> is an art festival
open to all Somalis from the Horn of Africa region and the Diaspora that aims
to support cultural expression in Somalia as a means of promoting peace and
understanding. Amateur artists can submit their art entries to a competition.
They will have the opportunity to display their art portraying images of peace,
freedom and reconciliation at the Festival and produce live art work. Entries
will be judged and the best art work will win prizes. The Festival builds off
IREX Europe and KMC's Theatre for Peace work in Somalia and is based on the
idea that culture and art can not only facilitate discussion among people but
also contributes to building a nation's identity.</p>

remains desperately difficult: Somalia faces key challenges in order to
re-establish safety and security, and to introduce sustainable democratic
institutions and processes. Since late 2012, significant progress has been
made, notably the establishment of the Somalia National Government and
consolidation of an increasingly peaceful Mogadishu. However, Somalia remains
in the phase of “early recovery”: while Al Shabaab have been driven out of
large parts of Somalia and piracy attacks drastically reduced, for Somalia to
ensure a peaceful future, its people must come together under a common
understanding. Somaliland and its capital city Hargeisa is an example of peace
and stability in the Somali context. Somaliland declared its independence in
1991 but that independence has gone largely unrecognised by the international
community. It has however managed to maintain a significant level of stability
in the region and this despite receiving little international funding. <p></p>
<p><b>Art for Peace</b> – We firmly believe that integrating culture into
conflict resolution, and more generally into development work, is essential to
the process of nation building and peace building in post-conflict societies
which requires the inclusion of the nation, community and/or society’s cultural
identity in order to achieve sustainable and concrete peace and stability.
Culture reflects a nation’s identity and people need to see themselves in this
cultural and national context if they are to embrace the peace process and
learn to live together with tolerance and understanding. </p>
<p><b>Why crowdfunding?</b> We have never used crowdfunding before and have
turned to it because we have been unable to secure funding to continue our work
in Somaliland and the Horn of Africa. The global financial crisis is still
hitting governments and international funders hard and there is less and less
money for development projects, especially for what are considered “soft”
projects that focus on art and culture. IREX Europe and KOW Media strongly
believe in the importance of art and culture in the development of peaceful and
stable societies and that is why we have committed to cover the costs of the
Festival with money from our savings even if we raise no money from donors or
crowdfunding. Your contributions can help us cover those costs and enlarge the
different activities, including bigger prizes for the winning artists and more
workshops for youth attending the Festival (see below what your contributions
will be paying towards)! We strongly believe that the Somali Peace Festival and
what it brings to Hargeisa and its region is essential to maintaining peace and
stability in the area. </p>
<p>By contributing in any way you
can to this project, you will be helping the Somali people maintain and develop
a cultural event they can call their own. The Festival brings people together
and promotes Somali produced and Somali owned art in a country where radical
leaders have banned the use of any form of art in many parts of the country. By
helping the Somali people sustain this event, you will be giving them the
opportunity to feel proud of their culture and of being Somali. We hope that
this feeling will contribute to maintaining the current and growing peace in
the region.</p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3><b>What we
need and how you can help...</b></h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise 8,970 € to
cover costs of venue rental, of the youth drama workshops that will be
delivered for youth and children present at the Festival, of the Geediga Nabada
Peace Caravan performances, and the cost of prizes for the winning art entries.
As stated before, the more we can raise, the bigger the Festival will be, and
the more powerful it will be, bigger prizes for winning artists and more
theatre and art workshops for youth! The costs will of course be covered by
IREX Europe if we do not raise the money hoped for. This will however be coming
out of our savings which is somewhat of a risk for us, as we are a small NGO with
limited financial capacity. But we are ready and willing to take this risk as
we believe that this is exactly the sort of grassroots initiative that should
be supported if we’re to secure lasting peace for the Somali people.</p>
<p>In return for your contributions,
we will be offering the following:</p>
<p><b>5 €</b> - IREX Europe will send you (if you wish!) regular email
updates on the Festival (its best entries and links to stories) and IREX
Europe's work.</p>
<p><b>10 €</b> - We will send you IREX Europe stickers for you to stick
around, wherever you are in the world!</p>
<p><b>20 €</b> - IREX Europe will send you a Somali postcard that we will
have made with a Somali poem, Somali calligraphy or picture!</p>
<p><b>50 €</b> - IREX
Europe will send you a USB stick with a collection of photos of the Festival,
the artists and their entries and a video of the prize giving ceremony!</p>
<p><b>100 € and more!</b> -
We will have a local Somali artist do an artistic display at the Festival showing
the names (or alias!) of all the most generous contributors! Individual names
or the names of an organisation can be displayed. </p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3><b>What your
contributions will do...</b></h3>
<p>We think it’s important to say
that all funding received will go in priority towards paying for the Festival’s
costs, before human resources’ costs. If we receive enough to pay towards
salary costs, KMC’s staff will in priority be covered. The amount targeted by
this campaign is intended to cover costs of renting a venue for the Festival
for two days. This is one of the highest costs as the venue has to be
completely secure as Somaliland, Somalia and the region remain high-risk venues
for artistic and cultural events. We therefore need a venue equipped with metal
detectors, body scans and security personnel to minimise security risks during
the Festival. Your contributions will also go towards covering the costs of the
prizes we will be delivering to the best artists who submitted entries to the
Festival’s competition. We’re budgeting 3,000 € for prizes which is a modest
amount. This will allow us to allocate 1000 € per category. If we raise more
money however, we will be able to raise the value of the prizes and potentially
the number of prizes. Currently we plan to award 500 € for the winner of each
category, 300 for second place and 100 for third place. </p>
<p>We also want the Festival to be
an interactive event, with shows and workshops for people to attend. Your
contributions will therefore also go towards covering the costs of a theatre workshop
for youth attending the Festival. During this workshop, youth will be able to
learn about Drama for Conflict Transformation methods. The idea is to inspire
young people to be creative and use different art forms to promote peace and
understanding. To complete everything, the Geediga Nabada Peace Caravan will perform
at the Festival, and your contributions will also go towards covering their
fees.</p>
<p>The use of art and culture in
peace building is a proven development technique that IREX Europe has been
using extensively since 2008. IREX Europe started working in Bangladesh in 2008
using cinema and a touring cinema van, coupled with community discussions, in
rural communities. In 2009, IREX Europe did similar work with youth in
Indonesia, this time using theatre as a tool to spark discussions on taboo
subjects such as religious tolerance. 2009 is also the year that IREX Europe
started working with KMC and the Geediga Nabada Peace Caravan in Somaliland,
South Central and with the Somali refugee populations in Kenya, using theatre,
poetry and music to promote peace and understanding and trigger debate on taboo
subjects. See the pictures below of our work with Somali refugees in Kenya!</p>

we?IREX Europe - We're an NGO
founded in 2004 and based in Lyon, France. We work on many different human
rights' issues but we're particularly specialised in free media programmes and
conflict resolution projects. The Festival builds off our Theatre for Peace
projects we've implemented since 2009 with our local partner KOW Media, based
in Hargeisa, Somaliland. The Theatre for Peace Road Show program aimed at
helping people address conflict using Drama for Conflict Transformation (DCT)
methods that combine theatre, debate and poetry to create a “safe space” for
exploring incendiary issues such as religion, clan and tribal conflicts, female
genital mutilation (FGM), domestic violence, human rights... The program built
on KOW Media’s work through its “Geediga Nabada” Peace Caravan team of trained
theatre practitioners. DCT is a rich methodology that encourages improvisation
and play to help participants develop new views and behaviours. IREX Europe
specialists worked with the theatre troupe to help them incorporate DCT techniques
in their performances. In situations of entrenched conflict, where debate and
historical analysis is rare and often leads itself to conflict, DCT unlocks the
creative power of individuals and communities to adopt new perspectives and
develop novel solutions to local problems. Not only is DCT a powerful tool for
transforming attitudes, it also provides a platform for practicing conflict
resolution strategies. IREX - IREX is our big sister organisation, our 'network partner'
as we say! IREX is an international non-profit organization providing thought
leadership and innovative programs to promote positive lasting change globally.
IREX enables local individuals and institutions to build key elements of a
vibrant society: quality education, independent media, and strong communities.
To strengthen these sectors, their program activities also include conflict
resolution, technology for development, gender, and youth. IREX employs
field-tested methods and innovative uses of technologies to develop practical and
locally-driven solutions with our partners in more than 100 countries. Founded
in 1968 and based in Washington DC, IREX has a staff of over 400 professionals
worldwide and is helping us promote the festival both within the US and
internationally. KOW Media Foundation - KOW Media Corporation (KMC) is a Somaliland
based media and advertising company that offers multiple services such as
advertising, events and media management, billboard and bus wrap advertising...
It's Foundation, a non-profit entity, has been working on civic education and
engagement work in Somaliland and South Central for many years. The staff at
KOW Media, inspired by their Director, run the foundation because they believe
in a peaceful future for the Somali people. The last IREX Europe and KOW Media
project ended in 2012 with the first Somali Peace Festival - Film, Photo and
Art and was a success Somalilanders are still talking about today. KMC wants to
make the Festival annual, establishing a major cultural event in Hargeisa that
could pave the way for more stability and peace in the region. IREX Europe and
IREX are dedicated to supporting KMC in this process and making the Somali
Peace Festival a regular, successful event for all Somalis.

What is
the Somali Peace Festival?
The Somali Peace Festival - Film, Photo and Art is an art festival
open to all Somalis from the Horn of Africa region and the Diaspora that aims
to support cultural expression in Somalia as a means of promoting peace and
understanding. Amateur artists can submit their art entries to a competition.
They will have the opportunity to display their art portraying images of peace,
freedom and reconciliation at the Festival and produce live art work. Entries
will be judged and the best art work will win prizes. The Festival builds off
IREX Europe and KMC's Theatre for Peace work in Somalia and is based on the
idea that culture and art can not only facilitate discussion among people but
also contributes to building a nation's identity.

                               Children
gathering to see the Theatre show.                          Villagers and the moderator
talking after the show.This video made by KMC explains how the theatre troupe puts on its performances around Somaliland, how 
they constantly have to negotiate with village elders, religious leaders
 and the authorities in order to perform. IREX Europe’s Theatre 
Specialist Steve Grihault is also shown passing on Forum Theatre 
interactive skills to the actors. The film ends with some shots from the
 Somali Peace Festival - Film, Photo and Art held in Hargeisa 28 February to 1st March 2012.
The situation in Somalia - after over two decades of conflict -
remains desperately difficult: Somalia faces key challenges in order to
re-establish safety and security, and to introduce sustainable democratic
institutions and processes. Since late 2012, significant progress has been
made, notably the establishment of the Somalia National Government and
consolidation of an increasingly peaceful Mogadishu. However, Somalia remains
in the phase of “early recovery”: while Al Shabaab have been driven out of
large parts of Somalia and piracy attacks drastically reduced, for Somalia to
ensure a peaceful future, its people must come together under a common
understanding. Somaliland and its capital city Hargeisa is an example of peace
and stability in the Somali context. Somaliland declared its independence in
1991 but that independence has gone largely unrecognised by the international
community. It has however managed to maintain a significant level of stability
in the region and this despite receiving little international funding. 
Art for Peace – We firmly believe that integrating culture into
conflict resolution, and more generally into development work, is essential to
the process of nation building and peace building in post-conflict societies
which requires the inclusion of the nation, community and/or society’s cultural
identity in order to achieve sustainable and concrete peace and stability.
Culture reflects a nation’s identity and people need to see themselves in this
cultural and national context if they are to embrace the peace process and
learn to live together with tolerance and understanding. 
Why crowdfunding? We have never used crowdfunding before and have
turned to it because we have been unable to secure funding to continue our work
in Somaliland and the Horn of Africa. The global financial crisis is still
hitting governments and international funders hard and there is less and less
money for development projects, especially for what are considered “soft”

<p>I'm Derek Gores, a collage artist from Florida. I recycle maps, data, magazines, and assorted scraps to create my portraits on canvas. I've had some great clients, collectors and shows in the US, and I'd like your help to take my work and my technique to Europe. </p>
<p>I'm taking a 7 day trip to the UK and France. Here's the plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Day COLLAGE WORKSHOP at Stockton Sixth Form College, at Stockton-on-Tees, UK. Recently I've had hundreds of students reach out to ask about my art and methods. For most of these young artists, it would be beyond their means to come take a workshop in Florida, so my plan is to take my technique to them. When the college wrote to me, I said let's figure it out... and here we are. We have a couple workshop spots open for project backers too.</li>
<li>SHOW THE WORLD my art, specifically Paris and London, through visits to galleries and a live demo/presentation.</li>
<li>MAKE NEW ART inspired by my trip... and culminating in an exhibition back in the US in Fall 2012. The show will include 10 new collages, as well as select work created by workshop students and new friends I meet along the way. Yes, you are invited.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this trip happen, I need to raise $9251</p>
<p>That $ will cover my travel, art supplies for demos as well as the original pieces, lodging, a touch of advertising, photo shoot expenses, archival reproductions, a skype shoot, and a couple bags of peanut m&amp;m's.</p>
<p>And what do YOU get for helping me?</p>
<p>Check the perks at the right- You'll see your shot at the original 10 pieces of art I will create, as well as a few spots in the workshops, signed reproductions of art, even your name or photo in one of the original collages... :) a skype studio tour, custom postcards behind the scenes on the trip... Not bad for art made from trash.</p>
<p>If I don't quite make the goal... I'll still take the trip but cut it back where it makes sense. And if I go way beyond the goal, that means I can scale things up... free workshops for more students, and more than the 10 original pieces of art.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Magazines in my recycled art look much prettier than in a landfill.</li>
<li>You get cool stuff.</li>
<li>I introduce Paris and London to my work... which I hope lands somewhere with a leg in Abstract Expressionism, touch of figurative Impressionism, bit of Rube Goldberg-ism, pinch of Street Art, Advanced Scrapbooking, and what LA dubbed the New Contemporary Movement.</li>
<li>I see the world a little, and make new pretty pictures.</li>
<li>Young cutting-edge artists get turned on to new techniques and a new way of thinking. I find that collage helps artists get beyond the pre-thought marks of painting and drawing, and into another place where the history in each piece of paper adds a sense of time and a different spatial experience. Good for the head... of the artist and the viewer.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can’t contribute cold hard cash? Next best thing would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about the campaign.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p>
<h3>FAQ: What Will the Art Look Like?</h3>
<p>Good question! The art will be consistent with my body of work, figures in a space, some black and white and others certainly inspired by the colors of the trip. Definitely depicting scenes from these fantastic destinations. You'll find new takes on my favorite themes: Beauty, Strength, Mystery, Time, and a teasing Narrative.  There will be 10 originals to choose from :) First come, first served.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Artistic creativity has played a significant role in culture across the centuries. We often ask artists to create without compensation. Music, art, writing, film making and other artistic endeavours are now being downloaded or viewed for free. <em>What if we could inspire artists to be more creative and compensate them in a unique way? </em></p>
<p>My name is Sue Kenney and I am an artist. Thank you for checking out our campaign. Several years ago after I was downsized, I walked 800 kilometers alone in the winter, across the north of Spain on a medieval pilgrimage route known as the Camino de Santiago de Compostela. When I returned home my creative side flourished. In the span of a few years I became a film producer/director, best-selling author (with a feature film adaptation of my book in development) and a screen and stage play writer/performer and a storyteller.</p>
<p>After conducting some casual research in the artist community, I found out that the majority of artists were inspired through walking. A story in <em>Ripley's Believe it or Not </em>talks about how Beethoven was once commissioned by three Austrian noblemen to write music. Instead of paying him for the composition, they paid him money to walk every day from sunrise until noon because they knew if he walked, he would create a masterpiece.</p>
<p>This inspired the creation of a foundation to pay artists who walk.</p>
<p>It's called <strong>Vision One Walk. </strong></p>
<p>We are in the process of becoming a Not for Profit group. To create awareness about <strong>Vision One</strong> our goal is to raise $8000.00 to cover the costs of the fall <strong>Vision One Walk</strong>  expenses, promotion, social media campaign, collateral materials and accommodation. We also see this IndieGoGo campaign to be the jumping point for exploring more projects in a similar spirit and funding the start-up of this foundation. Our next <strong>Vision One Walk</strong> is scheduled to coincide with Culture Days in September 2013, with the intention of supporting a select group of artists to be paid in product, cash or services.</p>
<p>To bring awareness to the correlation between walking and creativity, Sue Kenney and Amanda Stillemunkes, both Camino pilgrims, will walk 425 kilometers along the rugged Bruce Trail and Sue's doing it barefoot! </p>

<p>Vision One Walk....it's for Every One!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p></div>","Artistic creativity has played a significant role in culture across the centuries. We often ask artists to create without compensation. Music, art, writing, film making and other artistic endeavours are now being downloaded or viewed for free. What if we could inspire artists to be more creative and compensate them in a unique way? 
My name is Sue Kenney and I am an artist. Thank you for checking out our campaign. Several years ago after I was downsized, I walked 800 kilometers alone in the winter, across the north of Spain on a medieval pilgrimage route known as the Camino de Santiago de Compostela. When I returned home my creative side flourished. In the span of a few years I became a film producer/director, best-selling author (with a feature film adaptation of my book in development) and a screen and stage play writer/performer and a storyteller.
After conducting some casual research in the artist community, I found out that the majority of artists were inspired through walking. A story in Ripley's Believe it or Not talks about how Beethoven was once commissioned by three Austrian noblemen to write music. Instead of paying him for the composition, they paid him money to walk every day from sunrise until noon because they knew if he walked, he would create a masterpiece.
This inspired the creation of a foundation to pay artists who walk.
It's called Vision One Walk. 
We are in the process of becoming a Not for Profit group.

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>On Janurary 12th of 2013, I will be opening an exhibition of <a href=""http://liammmm.com/abandon/index2.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my photographs from a series called <em>Abandon/Decay</em></a>.  This will be the first public showing of this series.  It's also to be my first solo exhibition.  <a href=""http://www.kathmandu-bkk.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kathmandu Gallery</a> is a very well respected gallery in Bangkok, which is owned and managed by <a href=""http://www.agencevu.com/photographers/photographer.php?id=197"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Manit Sriwanichpoom</a>, a well-known art-photographer.  In Januarary of this year, K. Manit accepted my series for this upcoming exhibition, though there was a year-long waiting list for the space.  Since then, a few of the pictures have been shown in a group exhibition at <a href=""http://www.hgallerybkk.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">H Gallery</a> with quite a good response. We're getting closer and closer to the end of the year and it will soon be time for me to start work on my prints for this show.  I am quite particular with my printing and it takes some time to get each print exactally how I want it, so I'm allowing myself plenty of time to make this exhibition.  I intend to spend as much time as I can during November and December working on this. But- I need to invest some money in materials and studio-time.  That is the purpose of this- money to help cover my production costs.   </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>So, what I need to pay for is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Paper!  Paper is expensive!  I'm printing this series on a kind of paper called Epson Hot-Press Bright.  It's really a nice archival paper, here's <a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xfv6z0_david-lynch-discusses-epson-hot-press-natural-paper_tech"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a madman talking about it</a>.  But, it is not cheap.  </li>
<li>Printing!  These are archival-quality <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gicl%C3%A9e"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>Giclée</em></a> prints.  To have consistantcy in the high level of quality throughout each edition I will print the works using a <a href=""http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Pro/SeriesStylusPro11880/Overview.do"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">massive, high-end printer</a> at <a href=""http://www.bloomprolab.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bloom Labs</a>, here in Bangkok.  So I'll be spending a lot of time sitting in their studio, working on the images, testing a print, adjusting the Digital Negative, testing another print, adjusting, testing and so on.  For the four prints that were in the group show at H Gallery, I spent 4 days at Bloom working.  All this testing eats up paper and ink pretty quickly and Large-Format ink is very expensive.   But it is the only way to make the prints perfect.</li>
<li>Mounting/framing.  Each of the works must be prepared to be able to hang in the gallery.  This means dry-mounting them in an archival fashion and building frames for them to go in.  Again, these materials are not cheap.     </li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the main costs that I need to cover before the show.  Should this campain exceed its goal, the remaining funds will go to continuing work on this series.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What you can get</h3>
<p>In return for your contribution, there are a number of things I can send to you, from some nice little cards with the artwork, to the actual prints that will be in the exhibition (at a discounted rate!), to some very high-end light-box prints that will not even be available at the show!  Please have look to see what sorts of things are available before the show opens •---------------------------------------------------&gt;</p>
<p>Whether or not this fund-raising campaign reaches its stated goal, your contribution <em>will </em>get to me and I <em>will</em> send you what you want.  The only difference is I will have to find other avenues to cover the remaining costs.  As they say- <em>The show must go on!</em></p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;""><i>ABOUT THE VENEZUELAN ART FESTIVAL</i></span></h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This festival was created back in 2010 in New York City as an initiative by  Ishow NY Production and the Centro de Directores para el Nuevo Teatro. Its main goal is to provide a platform to promote and exhibit Venezuelan art in the Big Apple For two weeks, Venezuelan art takes over New York City with plays, staged readings, live music shows, films, visual arts and fashion. The Festival has been supported by the Repertorio Español,  The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, Roy Arias Studios &amp; Theaters, Instituto Cervantes, Taller Latinoamericano ,  The Producer’s Club, Teatro LATEA, Centro Español, Goya Foods, Delta Airlines and Fractal Studios.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Since the creation of the Venezuelans in New York City Festival (former name) in 2010, Venezuelans around the world have asked its producers and directors to endorse and also produce similar events in different cities and countries apart from just the NYC area, and to help promote Venezuelan art at a larger scale. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">For this reason, the Venezuelans in NYC Festival (VNYCF) officially changes its name to “VENEZUELAN ART FESTIVAL (VAF)”. New York City will remain as the original headquarter for the VAF but the festival will also travel (starting in 2014) to Miami, Madrid,  London,  Paris  Shanghai and Beijing </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is the aim of the board of directors that with hard work, time and effort, the Venezuelan Art Festival will have an official edition in as many cities and countries as possible.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is important to highlight that we do not have any support from the government or any political parties from our country. We have already produced 2 editions thanks to the support of individuals, institutions and companies from around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is why your support is so important to us, without it, we won't be able to continue with our efforts to promote the best of our country so the world gets to know what Venezuelans really have to offer: Our wonderful culture, our incredible artists and our love for life and for art. </span></p>
<p>The Venezuelan Art Festival is a huge project, and many people think we are a little bit crazy for putting so much effort, resources and time into promoting our culture around the world, but for us, there is no better way to spend our energy, money and time than to do so. </p>

This festival was created back in 2010 in New York City as an initiative by  Ishow NY Production and the Centro de Directores para el Nuevo Teatro. Its main goal is to provide a platform to promote and exhibit Venezuelan art in the Big Apple For two weeks, Venezuelan art takes over New York City with plays, staged readings, live music shows, films, visual arts and fashion. The Festival has been supported by the Repertorio Español,  The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, Roy Arias Studios & Theaters, Instituto Cervantes, Taller Latinoamericano ,  The Producer’s Club, Teatro LATEA, Centro Español, Goya Foods, Delta Airlines and Fractal Studios.
Since the creation of the Venezuelans in New York City Festival (former name) in 2010, Venezuelans around the world have asked its producers and directors to endorse and also produce similar events in different cities and countries apart from just the NYC area, and to help promote Venezuelan art at a larger scale. 
For this reason, the Venezuelans in NYC Festival (VNYCF) officially changes its name to “VENEZUELAN ART FESTIVAL (VAF)”. New York City will remain as the original headquarter for the VAF but the festival will also travel (starting in 2014) to Miami, Madrid,  London,  Paris  Shanghai and Beijing 
It is the aim of the board of directors that with hard work, time and effort, the Venezuelan Art Festival will have an official edition in as many cities and countries as possible.  
It is important to highlight that we do not have any support from the government or any political parties from our country. We have already produced 2 editions thanks to the support of individuals, institutions and companies from around the world. 
This is why your support is so important to us, without it, we won't be able to continue with our efforts to promote the best of our country so the world gets to know what Venezuelans really have to offer: Our wonderful culture, our incredible artists and our love for life and for art. 
The Venezuelan Art Festival is a huge project, and many people think we are a little bit crazy for putting so much effort, resources and time into promoting our culture around the world, but for us, there is no better way to spend our energy, money and time than to do so. 
If you are unable to contribute, you can always help by letting your friends and family know about this campaign, make some noise! we would really appreciate it! Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools so you can let your social media friends know about us! 
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

<p>Cet
été, les mystérieux petits hommes des jardins auront besoin de vous pour
que l’événement artistique les <i>Jardins réinventés de la Saint-François </i>puisse se poursuive. La 8e édition de
l’événement le plus attendu de la saison estivale à la Maison des arts et de la

principalement du Québec de créer des oeuvres <i>in situ</i> audacieuses bien

bordé par la rivière Saint-François. Quant à vous, public avide de nouveauté,

<p>Comme vous le
savez, les <i>Jardins réinventés</i> connaissent un grand succès depuis déjà 7

difficile de financer cet événement artistique d'envergure en ces temps
d’austérité.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Il est
primordial de continuer à offrir un territoire de création ainsi qu'une

conventionnels pour que l'art puisse s'épanouir pleinement et librement. C’est
également une manière de rendre l’art plus accessible, car le parc est un lieu

<p>La thématique de la 8<sup>e</sup> édition de
l’événement attirera votre attention: Foultitude, la nature des liens. Formé
à partir des mots <i>foule</i> et <i>multitude</i>, le terme fait référence à la
multiplicité, au rassemblement d’individus ou d’objets, à la réunion et à l’amalgame. Une culture foisonnante est rendue possible par les liens qui
unissent les citoyens comme les artistes. En cette période
d'austérité, il est temps de se rassembler et de créer un élan de solidarité,
une collectivité d’artistes et de gens qui croient en la culture, une
foultitude de liens quoi! </p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>À quoi servira le 7000$ ?</b></h4>

<p>Les artistes sélectionnés bénéficieront de 75% de la
somme amassée. Le reste servira à assurer la portion
logistique ainsi qu’une partie de la publicité associée à l’événement. 7000$
est le minimum à amasser pour que l'événement puisse se réaliser. Pour ce
montant, vous pourrez visiter les jardins de 5 artistes professionnels + 2
jardins collectifs. Pour les jardins collectifs, 2 groupes pourront vivre
l’expérience des <i>Jardins </i>en tant que

En créant Les Jardins réinventés de la
Saint-François, il y a huit ans, la Maison des arts et de la culture de
Brompton s’est positionnée dans la région en tant que diffuseur d’un art
actuel, multidisciplinaire.


Seul laboratoire d’innovation et forum
d’expérimentations récurrent en art des jardins contemporain in-situ sur le
territoire Sherbrookois, l’événement Les Jardins réinventés de la
Saint-François est un lieu d’inspiration qui offre une vitrine stimulante pour

Lostiks are avid varmints, they're always up to something and love to retrieve objects, especially keys!;)

The character is cute, friendly, affectionate.They are whimsical at food so you need to feed them milk, fruits, and most importantly cookies!:)

<h3>About Me and ""Confessions Of A Stay At Home Mom""</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Barbara Pickles. As a fine art photographer, I'm an Artist In Residence at Studio Channel Islands Art Center In Camarillo, CA. I have been accepted to exhibit in the Director's Gallery of the Art Center in September of this year. </p>
<p>I will be showing my ""<strong>Confessions Of A Stay At Home Mom</strong>"" portfolio. (<a href=""http://www.barbarapickles.com/confessions.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""confessions"">BarbaraPickles.com/confessions</a>) This is a series of 13 self-portraits that evovled over 2 years as I worked to convey my personal reality within the family. This process constantly brought me back to the dining room table. Here the family comes together in various mutations at all different times of the day for a full range of activities. In all the images I was absent. Ultimately I stepped in front of the camera, and through pose and gesture found a language to communicate my emotional experiences as an American woman, wife, and mother.</p>
<p>I'm asking for your help to raise $3,500 by August 5th to fund the printing, framing, and marketing of this show. The images will be large format archival pigment prints so the frames will be big as well.

Testimonials
'Honoured to have been the recipient of last year’s 'Visitors Choice Award' I would urge everyone to support, in whatever way that they can, the tireless work being done by the 'Passion for Freedom Festival’.
The Festival brings together artists from many corners of the globe whose work treats about human rights issues and defends freedoms of expression. It provides a much needed platform for information dissemination, reflexive discussion and artistic articulation.
It highlights ongoing repressive issues and potentially enables social, governmental, and dogmatic change at this time of increasing global conservatism.’

<p>Legacy was conceived about a year ago.  I have been growing more and more concerned about the effects of natural resource extraction on our environment both locally and across the country, and  I decided it was time to stop talking and take action. </p>
<p>I wanted to address the pitfalls of our 'economic development at all cost' approach to the environment, and this combined with the fact that the killer whale has long been one of my favourite animals, made this a perfect opportunity to combine these two passions into one project.</p>
<p>On entering the exhibit, viewers will marvel at a life-sized, 25 foot long, killer whale skeleton sculpted entirely from reclaimed cedar and suspended from the ceiling, encircled at ground level by a ring of information pedestals representing barren stumps left after clear-cut logging.</p>
<p>The goal of Legacy is to initiate discussions about the impacts of natural resource extraction on local communities and ecosystems.  It encourages the audience to ask questions such as: How did we get here?  Are we doing this for the right reasons?  Is this venture sensible and/or sustainable?  What can I do about it?  Legacy will provide guidance for answering these questions and will encourage the audience to examine their own local issues more deeply.</p>
<p>I need <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">your</span> help to make this happen.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Artist concept of the Legacy installation:</span></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><img alt=""Legacy Mockup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kenhallart.com/Legacy/Legacy_mockup.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Legacy Mockup""/></span></p>

<p><strong><strong><img alt=""banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kenhallart.com/Legacy/Banner_why.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""banner""/></strong></strong></p>
<p>In today's throw-away society, more and more people are being taught to consider only their own welfare, and to disregard the consequences of their actions as long as it serves their short-term goals. This is partly due to the effects of rampant consumerism, and partly due to a growing detachment of urban society from the environment that nurtures and provides for it.</p>
<p>Legacy will try to help reconnect people to their environment, appealing to all generations and helping to visualize the fragile and highly interconnected nature of our ecosystems.</p>
<p>Legacy deals specifically with the issue of logging on Canada’s West Coast and the effect this is having on the local resident Killer Whale population.  The logging is affecting the whales both directly through pollution and indirectly by poisoning and warming the rivers, which is damaging key salmon spawning grounds.  With fish being the main diet of the resident whales, the reduction in salmon is putting great pressure on the whales to find enough to eat, and what they are eating is often highly contaminated.</p>
<p>All over the country, communities are facing difficult decisions presented by proposed and on-going extraction of natural resources.   Ventures such as the logging of vast tracts of forest in British Columbia, the extraction of petroleum from the oil sands in Alberta, the proliferation of gravel quarries in Ontario and the construction of hydro generating dams in Quebec are just a few of the areas where our need for resources and our local environment are colliding head-on. </p>
<p>We as individuals need to understand where the resources that support our ever growing cities and our economy are coming from and we need to be aware of the impact that extracting them is having on our environment so that we can proceed in a sensible and sustainable manner.  Legacy is a warning that indiscriminate consumption of our natural resources can have devastating, often unforeseen impacts on our environment.</p>

</ul></div>","Legacy was conceived about a year ago.  I have been growing more and more concerned about the effects of natural resource extraction on our environment both locally and across the country, and  I decided it was time to stop talking and take action. 
I wanted to address the pitfalls of our 'economic development at all cost' approach to the environment, and this combined with the fact that the killer whale has long been one of my favourite animals, made this a perfect opportunity to combine these two passions into one project.
On entering the exhibit, viewers will marvel at a life-sized, 25 foot long, killer whale skeleton sculpted entirely from reclaimed cedar and suspended from the ceiling, encircled at ground level by a ring of information pedestals representing barren stumps left after clear-cut logging.
The goal of Legacy is to initiate discussions about the impacts of natural resource extraction on local communities and ecosystems.  It encourages the audience to ask questions such as: How did we get here?  Are we doing this for the right reasons?  Is this venture sensible and/or sustainable?  What can I do about it?  Legacy will provide guidance for answering these questions and will encourage the audience to examine their own local issues more deeply.
I need your help to make this happen.
Artist concept of the Legacy installation:

 

In today's throw-away society, more and more people are being taught to consider only their own welfare, and to disregard the consequences of their actions as long as it serves their short-term goals. This is partly due to the effects of rampant consumerism, and partly due to a growing detachment of urban society from the environment that nurtures and provides for it.
Legacy will try to help reconnect people to their environment, appealing to all generations and helping to visualize the fragile and highly interconnected nature of our ecosystems.
Legacy deals specifically with the issue of logging on Canada’s West Coast and the effect this is having on the local resident Killer Whale population.  The logging is affecting the whales both directly through pollution and indirectly by poisoning and warming the rivers, which is damaging key salmon spawning grounds.  With fish being the main diet of the resident whales, the reduction in salmon is putting great pressure on the whales to find enough to eat, and what they are eating is often highly contaminated.
All over the country, communities are facing difficult decisions presented by proposed and on-going extraction of natural resources.   Ventures such as the logging of vast tracts of forest in British Columbia, the extraction of petroleum from the oil sands in Alberta, the proliferation of gravel quarries in Ontario and the construction of hydro generating dams in Quebec are just a few of the areas where our need for resources and our local environment are colliding head-on. 
We as individuals need to understand where the resources that support our ever growing cities and our economy are coming from and we need to be aware of the impact that extracting them is having on our environment so that we can proceed in a sensible and sustainable manner.  Legacy is a warning that indiscriminate consumption of our natural resources can have devastating, often unforeseen impacts on our environment.

 

Funding will go toward the design and fabrication of Legacy.  This will cover costs from material acquisition and printing of promotional material to the engineering assessment of the suspension of the completed piece.
Funds received beyond the initial target will be used to help Legacy tour the country, in order to make the installation accessible to a larger audience and to spread the message as widely as possible.

</blockquote><br/></div>","Project 200: Botanical Documentation of Tallgrass Prairie.This project is broadly engaged with art, the environment and education. Purposes: 

Documenting 200 native tallgrass prairie plants and building an image bank for scientific and educational use.  http://www.project200imagebank.blogspot.com/            

Raising awareness about the declining plant population and promoting conservation through exhibitions and community activities.
Helping teenagers and young adults to find opportunities to enjoy the beauty of nature, and to explore possible careers in art. 
Documenting American medicinal plants.
Why Does the Tallgrass Prairie Matter?
It is one of the planet's most imperiled ecosystems with less than 1% of the original prairie remaining.
It covered about 150 million acres in the central United States before the 1830s. 
This 8,000 year old ecosystem was brought to the brink of extinction in about 50 years. WE DID THAT!
It is home for many struggling native plants, insects and animals that support the planet's health and our own.
Prairie plants have been used as medicines by native Americans for thousands of years. Losing them means losing potential cures for diseases.  
Tallgrass prairie plants are disappearing faster than one can imagine. There is no time to waste! They need to be documented.
We are the ones who must protect this unique American heritage for future  generations.
Who Am I?   What Can I Do?                                         Royal Catchfly, Silene regia, listed as federally endangeredI am Heeyoung Kim, a botanical artist living in the Chicago region of Illinois. I believe I was born to be a botanical artist. I truly do. I discovered this wonderful gift in my 40s after taking a drawing class at the Chicago Botanic Garden. I went on to paint plants in watercolor, drawing on brush skills I learned as a child from my father, a second-generation master calligrapher. One of my first watercolor paintings, Royal Catchfly (image shown above), was accepted for an international juried exhibition of endangered plants. From 2009 to 2011, it was exhibited at Smithsonian Natural History Museum, Royal Botanic Garden KEW, London and three other venues.This image has been displayed on the Smithsonian Natural History Museum website exhibition page since 2011.  http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/Painting rare and endangered native plants has been my passion ever since. My humble wildflower paintings have won some of the botanic art world's most prestigious awards.

I spent years tracking, studying and sketching my subjects, often in remote areas and working with little gear to avoid disturbing their habitats.  
Showing the beauty of native plants can be powerful. Native plants are collectively categorized as ""weeds"" in the minds of people. They are not allowed in well maintained gardens. They are gardeners' enemies. They are eradicated.Exhibitions can change this view.  When I exhibit, I like to invite a conservationist or a plant expert as a guest speaker in order to provide convincing information about the benefits one gains from maintaining native plants in a home garden. Many people have told me they enjoy Royal Catchfly in their gardens after seeing my painting.  My exhibitions bring plant science and conservation efforts to the public very effectively. People learn about non-native invasive plants that destroy ecosystems. Many sign up to volunteer or support local conservation groups after being inspired by exhibitions.  Every stage of plant life is beautiful and so is every human.                                                       Prairie Crabapple, Malus ioensisWeak or strong, new or old, live or dead, all creations are beautiful in every stage. This painting celebrates resurrection of a native crabapple tree. A dead trunk is the main character, and a half dead, less than perfect tree is pushing all its energy to shoot a new twig and succeeds in blooming.

I'm a single mom, so I am not able to save the money quick enough before May 1st gets here. I don't receive any outside help. And have been forced to live paycheck to paycheck since I'm limited on what hours I can work, so I can get my daughter to and from school. To add to  our misfortune, my daughter broke her arm at school this past September. And the doctor bill to have it fixed made my heart sink. It was more than I could afford. Its been one thing after another. And has been extremely hard to manage to make things work, and to see the light at the end of this pitch black tunnel. But to make a long story short, my rent was raised to push my daughter and I out of our home.So I want to ask for help in raising $550.00 to help with the cost of the deposit, and the fees for setting up the utilities in a new home. I could never ask for something like this without giving something back in return, so I've included perk options to give back in return for all your help!*If you do not wish to receive these items, donations are greatly appreciated!Thank you in advance for reading our story, and for all your help! You would be a blessing in our endeavor to find a new hope! The place that we call home.* Update - 3/26/2015Thanks to Adem and Stephanie for being the first to help us! And thank you for everyone that immediately jumped in to share the Campaign across the internet! As of last night our need for this Campaign to reach it's goal has become our only hope. My landlord informed me last night that she has found two people that want to rent out both our rooms for $300/each.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! My name is John, and I'll soon be a fourth-year participant at Burning Man 2018! By day I'm an automation engineer in the electronics industry, but at night my passion for weird LED projects takes over. </p>
<p>One of my strange prototypes made it to the 2017 Burn, and after a bit of scaling, it has evolved into a fully-fledged honorarium project! A few tireless friends and I are working to present you: <u>Ring Theory</u>! It is a highly interactive sculpture that melds light, reflective rings, and a gift of your inertia to produce some very neat effects. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As our team was fortunate to be included among 2018 Honoraria recipients, the Burning Man organization will be giving us a portion of the funds we need to deliver this project. Funding is only partial, however, so we've come up with a plan to get us all the way to the Playa! Our target is to close the $2500 gap in funding. </p>
<p>In exchange for your support, <u>we are giving you the opportunity to ""adopt"" one of the 40 orbs that make up this project.</u> Your funds go towards the bill of materials for each unit, and after the event, you will receive the standalone orb you sponsored! We'll be cleaning them up to the best of our abilities, wiring them with a remote control, and then sending them out into the world. </p>
<p>There are three tiers of orbs -- the 16"", 22"", and 28"". Each one contains a set of rings, addressable LEDs, and a structural hoop. Five of these orbs make up a panel, and Ring Theory will have eight panels in total. </p>
<p>We have perks available for any budget, so make sure to check them all out! Everyone who donates will also receive access to a very special gallery after the event.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As some of you may know, most Burning Man projects are entirely community-driven. This effort is what makes this very special event possible. Ring Theory is a chance to get engaged with this amazing culture, pitch in, and bring Black Rock City to life!</p>

In which the narrator (THE OLD WOMAN) unravels the mystery behind a Duel that took place with no witnesses. She does this by reading between the lines of the book. Looking at the story with fresh eyes. 
Places the nameless characters against a period backdrop, in the heart of mid nineteenth century England. 


Inspired by the last fatal Duel fought in 1852, a time when a man could be sentenced to death for winning.

My campaign is important to me because it allows me touch and speak to people through my art. I truly believe that compelling stories are what help change the world. 
By contributing you will help bring me one step closer to graduating, and changing the world through art. 


What We Need & What You Get

I currently need $2000 dollars for the film. The $2000 will cover everything needed for production including props, costumes, film equipment, and location.
Donating towards this film I feel is a way of giving back to the community. This film is a reflection on contributors investment in me as an artist.
Any little bit that is donated will go straight to production. Any excess amount of money will be put towards the film festivals and competing worldwide. 


The Impact
This project is very valuable to me as an artist because it allows me a voice in this world, and with that voice I get the opportunity to make a difference.

Risks & Challenges
There are no risks. Everything donated will be put towards the film and bring me one step closer to telling a story that is very dear to my heart.

<p>Konferencja larpowa (“KOLA”), ze swoją sześcioletnią tradycją na stałe wpisała się w życie polskiego środowiska larpowego. “KOLA” jest miejscem, w którym organizatorzy, twórcy i gracze wymieniają się wiedzą i doświadczeniem. Tutaj ogłaszane są najnowsze projekty i inicjatywy larpowe, promuje się najnowsze trendy.  Tegoroczna edycja jest już 8 w historii “KOLI”. Przewidujemy na niej ponad 100 uczestników oraz gości polskich, a także zagranicznych.</p>
<p>Tradycyjnie, udział w KOLI jest bezpłatny dla uczestników. Dzięki temu pozostaje ona możliwie otwarta na wszystkich uczestników. Bardzo zależy nam na utrzymaniu tego aspektu, stwarza on jednak organizacyjne wyzwania. Mimo współpracy z partnerami, organizacja konferencji wymaga pewnych wydatków. Koszt sali na afterparty, napojów dla prelegentów, bufetu z kawą i ciasteczkami składają się na konkretny budżet. Nie za wysoki, ale jednak trudny do sfinansowania ze środków stowarzyszenia larpowego jakim jest Argos. Dlatego zwracamy się do środowiska larpowego z prośba o pomoc.</p>
<p>Dla sfinansowania KOLI uruchomimy akcję crowdfundingową, za pośrednictwem której każdy chętny będzie mógł wesprzeć konferencję.

<h3>Why I'm running this campaign</h3>
<p>I am a contemporary visual artist who has been given the opportunity to create a public bronze sculpture for one of the lawns at <a href=""https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sandham-memorial-chapel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sandham Memorial Chapel</a>, a National Trust property in Burghclere that is famous for its cycle of paintings by Stanley Spencer. </p>
<p>This sculpture would be part of the exhibition <i>Of geometry and gods, side by side </i>which will take place from 8th to 26th April 2020 when I'll be showing my work alongside a number of stone carvings by the sculptor and architect <a href=""https://jamesdunnettarchitects.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">James Dunnett</a>.</p>
<p>This is a exciting opportunity for me as it would mean I could create my first ever large scale sculpture and install it at a historic location.</p>
<p>The foundry costs involved are £3,960. I am preparing my application to Arts Council England for funding however they expect at least 10% to come from other sources. A higher percentage will improve my chance of success. I am therefore seeking 50% of the foundry costs, i.e. £1,980 via this campaign.</p>
<p>So far I have produced a series of studies that suggest what the finished sculpture would look like. To see those, and find out more about the ideas behind my work, please watch the short <a href=""https://youtu.be/ciivmNNPg0E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a>.</p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ways to help and get rewarded</span></h3>

<h3>Why this campaign matters</h3>
</div><div>
<p>My artistic training was in painting and printmaking but in recent years I have been getting more ideas that need to be explored in three dimensions.  So far I have made some small sculptures in clay and plaster and I was further encouraged when earlier this year one of my ceramic reliefs was selected for the Creekside Open by <a href=""http://www.sachacraddock.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sacha Craddock</a>.</p>
<p>If this opportunity goes ahead it would mean I could get valuable experience of working with the foundry technician to create the mould ready for casting. If you watch the video you can see shots of what processes are involved.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>The creation of the bronze is a mini-project inside the main exhibition project that will need careful planning. It is therefore important that I can confirm my level of funding by the end of November to allow enough time for the application to the Art Council as it has a six week review cycle.  I have previously been awarded funding so I know success is possible.</p></div><div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My wife and I are disabled artists - I was born with a birth defect and am in a wheelchair, and my wife has severe auto-immune issues and is legally blind. She is able to create art digitally by working on a tablet screen with her face only a few inches away. Her current laptop is on its last legs, is past its warranty, and fairly outdated besides. I'm trying to put together funds to get her a Lenovo Thinkpad - a tablet-screen laptop capable of heavy-duty processing for art software. The laptop is also her only real link to the outside world as her health issues have left her housebound since 1999. You can see a portfolio of her work at <a href=""http://somnambule.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://somnambule.deviantart.com/</a>. Once she's back up and running, she'll be coloring my covers for my Image book.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is very simple and specific - I will use the funds to purchase her a new laptop: a Lenovo Thinkpad with 16GB of RAM and a 500GB hard drive.  I addition to knowing you've helped someone in need, I am offering artistic services as perks. My wife's health is too fragile to guarantee set delivery dates on art, hence my stepping in and providing the perks. </p>
<p>I am a professional caricature and comic book artist - I draw with my mouth - and have been doing caricatures for over 20 years. I have a comic book series coming out from Image/Top Cow in November, but won't see royalties (if any!) until the new year, and I'm concerned that her current laptop won't last that long.</p>
<p>Contributors can get caricatures, portraits, and even comic book script and art portfolio critiques.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will be, simply put, keeping my wife's connection to the outside world alive, and helping her to once again create art as a healing process. We live below the poverty line, and there's no way that I could buy her this laptop myself before the new year. I'd hoped to be able to wait until then, but her current laptop is dying, and it probably won't make it.</p>
<p>I have several successful Kickstarters that helped me get my comic book deal, and a successful Indie Go Go campaign that helped me upgrade my own computer equipment last year and pay a few bills. I'm very transparent and keep in regular communication with my contributors, and have built a reputation for honesty.</p>

<p>GUEST BY COURTESY is an original performance developed by Jenny Larson – artistic director of Salvage Vanguard Theater – and Hannah Kenah – company member, performer, and writer for the Rude Mechs. Original music was composed by Graham Reynolds, who performs live when possible.</p>
<p>GUEST BY COURTESY portrays the mangled story of a pair of cousins waging their bizarre relationship over the course of a failing afternoon tea. Using high physicality, sharp language, and sheer vulgarity, the show plumbs the comedic depths of duration and desperation. </p>
<p>GUEST BY COURTESY has, thus far, delighted audiences in Texas and in Eastern Europe. We aim to add Brooklyn to that esteemed list. The show premiered in Austin in 2011 at the Salvage Vanguard Theater. GBC was then selected for the 2013 Fusebox Festival, an awesome contemporary performance festival that takes place in Austin every April and draws in work from around the world. For our Fusebox Festival run, we performed in a Masonic lodge - our absurd, feminist work entertained full houses and the portraits of ancient, dead men that surrounded us. The most incredible and surreal piece of the map fell into place when, in the fall of 2013, our team traveled to Sofia, Bulgaria as part of an artist exchange with the University of Sofia. There we performed the show in the opulent arms of the former royal palace turned National Art Gallery. </p>
<p>Our map is not complete. We want more entries. <br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Next stop, Brooklyn!!!</span></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
GUEST BY COURTESY is an original performance developed by Jenny Larson – artistic director of Salvage Vanguard Theater – and Hannah Kenah – company member, performer, and writer for the Rude Mechs. Original music was composed by Graham Reynolds, who performs live when possible.
GUEST BY COURTESY portrays the mangled story of a pair of cousins waging their bizarre relationship over the course of a failing afternoon tea. Using high physicality, sharp language, and sheer vulgarity, the show plumbs the comedic depths of duration and desperation. 
GUEST BY COURTESY has, thus far, delighted audiences in Texas and in Eastern Europe. We aim to add Brooklyn to that esteemed list. The show premiered in Austin in 2011 at the Salvage Vanguard Theater. GBC was then selected for the 2013 Fusebox Festival, an awesome contemporary performance festival that takes place in Austin every April and draws in work from around the world. For our Fusebox Festival run, we performed in a Masonic lodge - our absurd, feminist work entertained full houses and the portraits of ancient, dead men that surrounded us. The most incredible and surreal piece of the map fell into place when, in the fall of 2013, our team traveled to Sofia, Bulgaria as part of an artist exchange with the University of Sofia. There we performed the show in the opulent arms of the former royal palace turned National Art Gallery. 
Our map is not complete. We want more entries. Next stop, Brooklyn!!!
Kenah, Larson, and their amazing third-partner-in-crime Jason Hays will take their comedy to an East Bed-Stuy living room. Presented by the Brooklyn Yard, July 23rd- 30th 2016. http://www.brooklynyard.org/
The Brooklyn Yard is generously producing the show but the creative team needs help paying for airfare and housing.    What We Need   
$1000 to pay for three airline tickets to get Kenah, Larson, and Jason Hays to Brooklyn. 

$2000 to rent an airbnb apartment for the two week run.

What You Get
Perks are listed on the right side of the screen --> gifts for your contribution can include tickets to Kenah and Larson's next collaboration WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY ALICE SITS, drink tickets, fancy party passes, and a handwritten letter from your favorite GUEST BY COURTESY cousin.



What if we exceed our fundraising goal? 




If we are lucky enough to exceed our goal of $3,000, we will use any additional funds in the following order of priorities:


First and Foremost, if we raise an additional $1,000 (making our grand total $4,000) we will bring Graham Reynolds on board for two or three shows where he will play the score live! Dreamy! If this becomes a reality, we will advertise far and wide what nights he'll be playing.


Secondarily, we will provide Jason, Jenny, and Hannah with per diem and artist stipends.

<h3>Inspiration, Motivation, Determination, Commitment = Realization.</h3>
<p>I have been to Black Rock City, or Burning Man, for the last 5 years in a row. Not an easy trip coming from Bali, Indonesia, but it has always been way worth any effort. I go for the dust (not really), the friendships I've forged, the spectacle, and the art. Being a Bali based artist I am always fascinated at what the desert has in store, and it never ceases to amaze me. And for a number of years I have been wanting to give back to Burning Man, in the form of art on the Playa. Then late last year I was inspired. Inspired by this friends family photo.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561201104/mfzw7ehitldncbqhpx0d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The fun and emotions shown, got me and got me good. I thought, wouldn't it be amazing to replicate those emotions, and create that moment at Burning Man. Wouldn't it be awesome to build an actual size static wooden roller coaster on the Playa. You climb the stairs and enter one of the cars. The lead car has a big red button at the front, when all are seated and ready it's pushed, a 15 second sound-byte starts over the speaker system, ""clack clack clack, whoosh whoosh, scream scream"", getting riders in the mood, ending in, BEEP BEEP BEEEEEEP, when a camera captures that moment, to remember that dusty moment forever. Dusty smiles.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561202831/secdq8fpuvg2k4r611mg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Imagine. Well that's what I did. Couldn't stop. Thoughts started growing outside my head. I started running my idea by like minded friends and their response was always the same, awesome, great idea, very Burning Man, do it. Do it? Alright, I will.</p>
<p>Needing to start somewhere I contacted Charlie, an architect friend of mine with the intention of asking him a few simple questions, was it possible, what would it cost, how would it be it made, how long would it take, where would I start, to name a few. We arranged a meeting, a sunset drink to hash it out. And that's when serendipity called, because at that meeting I also met Neil Thomas. I was to later find out that Neils London based company Atelier One, is the structural engineering firm responsible for world renowned Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, Cloud Gate in Chicago and has handled some of the biggest U2, Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd tours, among many other incredible projects. Charlie and Neil loved the idea. We bounced ideas, drew plans in the sand, and talked like it was happening. Neil especially took a shining to the concept, offering his services to help achieve this....</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561211960/g7wt6xubgqexo5i4so5c.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Above are his services. That was the start. And after that first meeting, there was no turning back. I was building a roller coaster. That's why I am sitting here, 6 months down the track, writing this. People were putting time energy and money into this project. It needed follow through. Commitment. I needed a team, and if Burning Man was good for only one thing, its forging life long friendships with like minded people. I now knew carpenters, builders, riggers, sound guys, electricians, lighting techs, artistic and construction types. And it wasn't long before I had a committed team of dust lovin', hard working, burn lovers, who are excited as I am to be fulfilling this dream.</p>
<p>This is important to me because I started this emotional roller coaster. It is important because we have been working on this all year, every day, on some aspect. It is important to not let people down. It is important because I would like to think that in this day and age, people are still willing to contribute for fun, and life's not all doom and gloom. And mostly, it is important to dream and to prove dreams can be achieved and goals can be attained.</p>
<p>Since the beginning I had a picture in my head. It is a line of people standing in the desert sun, laughing, chatting, happily waiting their turn to have their moment, their emotional moment up on the coaster. And if funded, I believe this will become the reality. I really do.</p>
<p>Imagine, <strong>SURPRISE</strong> - of first seeing An Emotional Roller Coaster on the playa, <strong>JOY</strong> - of riding up to it, <strong>FEAR</strong> - of seeing what's involved, <strong>EXCITEMENT</strong> - of participation, <strong>DISGUST</strong> - of the having to wait your turn, <strong>CONTEMPT</strong> of others getting a better photo, and the <strong>SADNESS</strong> - of having to leave.<br/>An Emotional Roller Coaster promises to bring back old and make new emotions.</p>
<p>This dream will only be made possible through your generosity in funding and our dedication to bringing this incredible art to Burning Man.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get = Money &amp; A Roller Coaster</h3>
<p>As simple as the plan may seem, this project costs money, and lots of time and effort from many. Over 100 people have at some stage already put valuable input in regarding the sourcing, buying, building, transporting, lighting, powering, storing and camera and sound aspects involved. Dozens of people have been spending countless hours for a dream. And now comes the crunch. Now comes the countdown. The core crew is primed and ready, every one hand picked for specific tasks, with the ability to achieve this crazy roller coaster.</p>
<p>The wooden trestle roller coaster aspect of the project is being pre-built late July in Nor Cal. The roller coaster vehicles are being made in Reno, and the other components, lighting, power, sound and signage are heading from L.A. to Black Rock City 20 Aug, for the on-site build.</p>
<p>While the biggest challenge now is funding, the biggest risk is under funding. In the event of the project under funded, depending on the amount received, will depend on the size of the dream achieved. Funds will determine the size and scope of An Emotional Roller Coaster. If funding  meets budget, expect all the bells and whistles. We will do whatever it takes to make this happen and some. Believe us, we have lists of emotional ideas to choose from and implement. If funding doesn't meet budget but will cover the basic wooden trestle coaster, coaster cars and lighting, (the bare minimum to achieve this this project this year), then that's what we will do, 150% bare minimum, as things can  be added on in the coming years. If funding does not reach the bare minimum, funds will be set aside, untouched, and we will apply for the 2020 Burning Man Honoraria Art Grant, which depending again, hopefully will bring us up to speed.</p>
<p>I am donating beautiful arty incentives from my Bali store, SKULL, for different tiered pledges, and special promotions.</p>
<p>Due to project fulfillment being priority, I will not be making any of the perks mentioned until after the Burn, so...Oct. Due to the nature of some of the perks, please understand that these things take time. I hope to have all delivered early 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Lasting Impact</strong></p>
<p>There is no intention to burn An Emotional Roller Coaster. This project has been designed for longevity. All components have been selected for durability. The plan is to bring An Emotional Roller Coaster back to the Playa every year. Build, dismantle, store, repeat. We are currently looking at storing in Carson City, being cheaper than Reno, and that means we don't have to lug everything back over the Sierra Nevada's. The facade and cars can be easily modified to help support the annual Burning Man theme. And we will have a slew of fresh options for emotional interaction, to be poured into the mix.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main obstacle is financial. The other obstacle foreseen is time, however, close as the 2019 burn is, we still believe this project is possible. If funded, it's full steam ahead, we got this.</p>
<p>To be honest, there are many obstacles, however, like we have done in the past, we will overcome them through teamwork and dedication to the goal. Between us all, we have created numerous playa projects over the years from art cars to theme camps. We are prepared to meet and tackle any obstacles. Feel free to ask any questions</p>

Our Story

Jews in ALL Hues (JIAH) was founded by Jared Jackson in Philadelphia. We are  an education and advocacy nonprofit organization that supports multiple-heritage Jews (Adoptees, Jews by choice, Jews with intermarried parents, and Jews of Color) in the creation of sustainably-diverse communities. Our goal is to build a future for the Jewish community where a person’s heritage is never a barrier to acceptance or integration
Jews in ALL Hues is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. Everyone will receive a receipt for the tax-deductible amount for any donation. 
.


Our Impact
Over 50% of Jewish millennials are adoptees, Jews by choice, children of intermarried parents, and/or Jews of Color. We know that there are many communities in which diversity is a major priority, yet are seeking better tools for a sustainable impact. Our programs have helped many multi-heritage Jews build a stronger connection to the Jewish people, and helped communities better accept and integrate diversity.





What We Need & What You Get
We need $10,000 to build ground-breaking Jewish diversity curricula that will equip Jewish communities in North America (synagogues, havurot, Hillel, outreach organizations, independent) with the  BEST tools to greatly improve their ability to welcome of Jews from all backgrounds. 
Your donations will fund:
Pilot sessions - testing, improving, and perfecting our menu of workshops and training seminars
New Jewish diversity media - videos, website, podcasts etc.
Consultants and staff - bringing in some of the greatest minds so we will be as effective as possible in achieving real change in American Jewish communities.
You will get a chance to really make a positive impact on the future of the Jewish people. Checkout our perks for more information!

<p>My name is Trishelle Jeffery. I've spent my life struggling with mental health issues and drawing comics about it.</p>
<p>I'm working on a book that takes an autobiographical approach to the question, ""How many parallel universes exist in which I am dead?"" The plot focuses on multiverse theory, and how that can relate to things we think about doing but don't act on. The book is intended for mature audiences.<br/></p>
<p>It will be made with roughly 30 pages of fine art printing, all done by hand. I will be printing and binding the edition of books myself at Constellation Studios in Nebraska during a residency I'm doing at the end of the summer.<br/></p>
<p>This fundraiser is a way for you to pre-order this book, which will be printed in an edition reflecting how many people order it.</p>
<h3>For me, for you<br/>
</h3>
<p>The money I earn in this campaign will largely go to studio fees for Constellation Studios and travel. I will also use these funds to purchase supplies, including paper, book board, binding thread, and matrices to print from.</p>
<p>The book will be printed as a limited edition, reflecting orders. So if you order one, a book will be made, just for you. I will not be printing any more than what is ordered. There will be no more printed after this, and no possibility to buy the physical handmade book in any other way. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Former work</h3>
<p>I'm currently pursuing my MFA in Print Media at Wichita State University. Between receiving my undergraduate degree and moving to Kansas for Grad school, I did a residency at the Book Arts Program at the University of Utah in 2013. For that residency, I made a much smaller book piece.<br/></p> <p>Some of my previously published comics appeared in <i>SLUG Magazine</i> and Grayhaven Comics' anti bullying anthology <i>You Are Not Alone 2</i>.
 My art has shown in exhibitions at the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art,
 in the Ulrich Museum, and various other spaces. My work has been 
exhibited alongside internationally famous artists such as Matthew 
Barney and Felix Gonzalez-Torres. You can see some of the work I've done over the past few years at my website, <a href=""http://trishellejeffery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trishellejeffery.com</a>.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>How you can help<br/>
</h3>There is an option to purchase a PDF of the book, for those that can only provide minimal support.<br/><br/>Regardless of what you decide to buy or not, please help spread the word!<br/>
