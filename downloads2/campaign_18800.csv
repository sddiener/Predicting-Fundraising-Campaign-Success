<p>The Aurora AppCo Alumni Series is an annual event hosted by Aurora Theatre in their Studio space. The goal of the Series is to give a platform to past and present apprentices creating their own work featuring young artists. The Series provides experience, and a voice, to the future of theatre in Atlanta. </p>
<p>This is the second year of the Series. The two shows this year are <i>Fish Eye</i> by Lucas Kavner and <i>A New Brain</i> by William Finn and James Lapine. <br/><i>Fish Eye</i> takes a slightly skewed look at four intertwining lives as we wade through their memories and examine what causes certain moments to crystallize in our minds, and how we look back when those moments have passed.<br/><i>A New Brain</i> is a musical that follows the story of Gordon Schwinn, a struggling, frustrated songwriter who suffers from a rare brain disorder that causes him to hallucinate, amongst other things, a tyrannical singing, dancing frog.</p>
<p>As young artists, we need funding to be able to do justice to these fantastic, fun, and quirky pieces of theatre. Funding which can help cover the costs of costumes, sets, props, royalties, marketing, and hopefully the ability to pay our talented team of actors and designers.</p>
<p>Our goal is $10,000. With the help of our friends and the friends of Atlanta theatre, this is super-doable. AND as a special way of saying ""THANK YOU, YOU'RE AMAZING AND WE LOVE YOU!"", we have some truly unique and fun perks for donors at all levels!</p>
<p>If you can't give a lot, give a little! If you can't give a little, please help spread the word about the exciting work we're doing!</p>

<h3>Kairos</h3>
<p>Kairos is a 50-minute dance event which traces the embodied timelines of six dancers. Too often, dancers’ stories are ignored in favor of their physical abilities. The aim of Kairos is to invert this tendency and through collage, poetry, electronic music and movement, tell their stories— from the quotidian to the traumatic. </p>
<p>In today’s society, women are physically inhibited by the clothes they wear, the movements they are taught, the pressures that are placed upon their beings by the ever present need for female perfection. Too often we ignore the backstory, how and why each woman came to look, to speak and to move as she does today. Kairos uses media images from magazines that trace the beauty trends throughout the years of each dancer’s life, in order to trigger the reactions of our company members. These reactions materialize for the audience in collage, poetic, musical and choreographic form. </p>
<p>The aim of Kairos is to be an evening of visual art, poetry, electronic music and dance. An evening where the unique story of each dancer is told. Above all, it is an evening where the personal can become universal as the audience engages with each dancer. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who We Are: </h3>
<p>Ephemera Dance Company is composed  of woman movers. Our artistic aim is to marry the genres of collage, electronic music, poetry and movement. The company takes its name from collected materials that have a short-lived expression— similarly Ephemera’s work is improvisation-based, time durational and participatory, thus taking aim at theatrical conventions. Ephemera values the unique emotional expression of each mover, be they musician, dancer or audience member. As an all female company, EDC aims to challenge preconceived notions of femininity and fembody expression. </p>
<p><strong>Katrina Elizabeth (Artistic Director) </strong>trained as a contemporary dancer at the San Francisco Conservatory and the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance. She received a degree in literature from Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Her area of investigation was the grotesque genre and its influence upon poetic and performance conventions. Katrina Elizabeth now lives and works in Germany where she is artistic director of Ephemera Dance Company—a dance company of women movers that works within collage, poetry, and movement. Her work investigates cultural biases towards women, especially as they pertain to bodily awareness and expression.</p>

<h3>What is TILTYARD?</h3>
<p>Tiltyard is a new Brooklyn-based theater company co-founded by Sara Holdren, Rachel Carpman, and Josephine Stewart. We are devoted to passionate physical storytelling, vibrant new interpretations of old tales, and ensemble-driven new work. We are artists and friends striving to tell thrilling, necessary stories in a spirit of serious play. <strong><a href=""http://www.tiltyard.org/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Learn more here!</a></strong></p>

<h3>What is MIDSUMMER?</h3>
<p><i>Midnight. The forest. Can a chance encounter between a wily fairy and a ragtag troupe of would-be actors bring the world back from the brink of destruction?</i></p>
<p>MIDSUMMER is a radical reworking of William Shakespeare's <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream, </i>created by Rachel Carpman and Sara Holdren. At once familiar and alien, joyful and vicious, MIDSUMMER explores the havoc we foolish mortals wreak on the world around us and revels in the redemptive power of imagination. This topsy-turvy new spin on the bard's most magical comedy incorporates text from every play in Shakespeare's canon to create a playful, aware, contemporary tale for skeptics, romantics, and those of us who still, somehow, believe in magic.</p>
<p>MIDSUMMER will perform October 13-16, 2016 at the American Theatre of Actors (314 W. 54th St, NY/NY) as part of the <strong><a href=""http://www.aracaproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2016 Araca Project</a></strong>. <strong><a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tiltyard-presents-midsummer-tickets-26675229329"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Get your tickets today!</a></strong></p>

<p>﻿For us, the real magic of theater is the support that lifts ideas out of our minds and sketchbooks and renders them vivid and tangible.Your generosity puts actors in the rehearsal room, designers in their workshops, and our show on the stage. Any amount you give will help us build the wondrous world we want to show you. And to see where your dollars are going when you donate to Tiltyard, take a look at this handy pie-chart:</p>

<h3>About This DogStar Theater Co. Production</h3>
<p>Hi Wonders!</p>

<p>Our first production took place last April and was ever so well received, and now we are ready to dive into our second production of the year with the comedy ""The Foreigner"" written by Larry Shue. This timely themed story brings together a unique bunch of characters in the middle of rural Georgia. <i> <strong>The story, although a comedy, dances around the themes of racism, stereotype, prejudice, and the human heart. This is a story that needs to be told - NOW.</strong></i></p>
<p>When I choose a play, I look for a story that will bring a community together. I look for characters and themes that will inspire conversation after the show. <strong>I want people to unite in the experience of watching a play that I direct. After the show, I want each member of the audience to walk out with a gem in their heart, a sparkle in their eye and a warmer sense of engagement with their fellow man, woman and greater world around them.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>THE IDEA</strong></h2>
<p>Hey, we're Lisa and Jeff, we're producing a musical, and we need your help.</p>
<p>This is not just any musical - it’s our favorite in the whole wide world.  It's the kind of show we dreamed of doing even while performing at such acclaimed venues as the Vancouver, Washington Sausage Festival and an 80's themed metal wedding.</p>
<p>The musical is “The Last Five Years”, by Jason Robert Brown.  Now if you're a drama nerd you are probably already obsessed with this award winning show, but if you are of the other 98.6% of the world population you’ve never heard of it. It's beautiful, funny, original, brutally honest and not nearly enough people have seen it.  We're working with a non-profit theater company to change that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN </strong></h2>
<p>The first step is to put on the show in Los Angeles.  This limited run will serve as our “pilot episode” for other theaters and venues around the country. If they like what they see in L.A., we’ll be able to take this thing on the road (the production is “pack and play” with a cast of two that can travel easily to anywhere looking for good theater). </p>
<p>We’ve already assembled our creative team, reserved the rights to the show and booked The Studio Theater at Sacred Fools in Hollywood for performances from <span data-term=""goog_845325792"" tabindex=""0"">November 11 – November 18, 2017</span>.  Paying for the show rights, theater, rehearsal space, sets, costumes, marketing materials, and tech crew is where you all come in.</p>
<p>From nose to tail, top to bottom, soup to nuts - and whatever other metaphor you can come up with - putting on this production for four nights is going to cost us the price of a used 2009 Chevy Cobalt, aka $7,000.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>JSLN Dance Company brings ballet with a difference to audiences in venues with a difference. We believe that world class ballet should be accessible to all audiences without the need to travel to bigger towns and cities and that it shouldn’t be limited to venues with perfect stages for dance.</p>
<p>In this campaign, we’re looking for dance lovers and supporters of JSLN Dance Company to help us continue to bring Sören Niewelt’s beautiful work to you in your home towns and villages.  Our audiences from this year’s Variations of Pointe II tour have overwhelmingly asked the company to return but we have yet to secure funding to proceed.</p>
<p>We would love for JSLN to become “self-funded”, through our supporters and sponsors.  This would allow us to do what we love doing and to bring you shows you love seeing. Our Facebook page alone shows almost 2,500 followers and “likes”.  This doesn’t include all the amazing feedback we’ve had from all of you during the Variations of Pointe II tour.  We performed to over a thousand of you in June and July this year. </p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you can help JSLN continue bringing dance not just to theatres and other locations, but to those who can’t get to our performances such as elderly residents in care homes and disabled children and young people in schools.  These organisations have neither the funds to pay for a performance or workshop nor the staff required to take people to performance venues.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to bring our next show to you, we need to be able to cover the basics such as costumes, props, travel, insurance, publicity materials and advertising costs.</li>
<li>As you may know, our Summer 2017 tour, Variations of Pointe II only happened because our dancers agreed to work for a subsistence allowance only.</li>
<li>We must be able to pay our dancers since loyalty and love of the work only stretches so far.</li>
<li>We’re looking for you to help us out and we know that many of you have already given us donations towards our Variations of Pointe II tour and bought raffle tickets at our shows.</li>
<li>Box office sales and workshop fees can pay for our basics but will not cover salaries.</li>
<li>Our income from ticket sales, based on our previous tours, will be about £12,000.</li>
<li>We are already receiving sponsorship in kind for rehearsal studio space, towards accommodation, for music editing and photography, and our behind the scenes staff are giving their time free of charge too. </li>
<li>We need to raise £50,000 to make this tour work and we’re asking for your help to raise this.</li>
<li>Through this crowdfunding appeal, we would like to offer you some special perks in return for supporting JSLN Dance Company rather than just asking for your donation.</li>
<li>Raffles held at our shows have proved popular, with prizes of signed pointe shoes and photos of our dancers being in great demand.</li>
<li>We would also like to bring you our 2018 calendar as a perk as well as some new merchandise items such as T-shirts.</li>
<li>We’re offering the opportunity to watch the company in rehearsal and class before the show too.  Our “Behind the Scenes with JSLN” workshops will have given a little taste of how a touring dance company works but this perk will be for a limited number of people to see the no-frills, unedited version!</li>
<li>If you’re a dance student and would like to have a special coaching experience, we’re offering private lessons with our Principal Dancer, Jessica Larbig or our Artistic Director.</li>
<li>If there is something you would like from us and can’t see in the list of perks, please contact us and let us know, we can always create other perks!</li>
<li>Every little bit helps us reach our goal, even if you can only afford to give £5 or £10.  We have almost 2,500 followers on Facebook alone so if everyone gave £10 we would be a good way towards our target!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Through your feedback at our shows, we know you want to see more. </li>
<li>JSLN Dance Company has toured the length and breadth of the UK for two seasons and our audiences are asking us to return.</li>
<li>We can’t do this without funding and sponsorship. </li>
<li>By giving to this campaign you can help us continue to bring the joy of dance to our audiences</li>
<li>Odile promises to be an amazing ballet which will enthral all audiences.  If you enjoyed our triple bills Variations of Pointe I and II, we can promise that you will love Odile!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We know that our audiences want to see more of JSLN Dance Company and we’re confident that Sören Niewelt’s new two-act ballet will amaze all of you.</li>
<li>Our biggest challenge, as it has always been, is to raise funds to bring our performances to you.</li>
<li>We have already confirmed bookings for performance venues and tickets are already on sale for our winter tour.  If we do not get sufficient funding, the biggest risk is that the tour cannot proceed.</li>
<li>While we are applying for funding from various sources, this is never guaranteed as we have found in the past.</li>
<li>Many care homes around our performance venues are looking forward to being a part of “Happy Feet”. Please help us to not disappoint the staff and residents.</li>
<li>We’re fortunate enough to have supporters in kind who are giving their services either free of charge or at discounted rates but our biggest expense is paying our dancers</li>
<li>Without well trained and highly motivated dancers, there would be no JSLN Dance Company.  It takes an average of 15 years to train a dancer, they deserve to be paid a proper fee for their work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Of course, without funds JSLN can’t function, but there are many other ways you can help us too. We've been told many times during our last tour that we don't advertise enough or do enough publicity.  Unfortunately, we can't afford paid advertisements in the local press, nor are we able to travel to every single town or village we’re performing in to distribute publicity materials in advance.</p>
<p>After dancers' fees, accommodation is by far our second biggest outlay. Even with partial sponsorship for one location, we still need to find affordable accommodation for some other venues.</p>
<p>Please email Loretta at <a href=""mailto:manager@jslndancecompany.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">manager@jslndancecompany.com</a> if you are able to, or may be interested in helping out with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping with publicity for our performances by:<ul>
<li>Distributing posters and flyers local to our show venues</li>
<li>Publicising the show via local press contacts</li>
<li>Publicising the show via social media sites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accommodation for the company close to performance venues – there will be 10 dancers and our Artistic Director.<ul><li>If you have an affordable rental property which sleeps 11 or are able to put up the company within an hour’s drive of the following, we’d love to hear from you:<ul>
<li>Bude, Cornwall</li>
<li>St Andrews</li>
<li>Gateshead</li>
<li>Sittingbourne</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>If you know of a dance school or group, regardless of age or ability who would like a workshop with our Artistic Director and company members, please let us know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, of course, even if you can’t help with any of the above and aren’t in a position to contribute, please help to spread the word about JSLN Dance Company and of course this campaign.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

We've been told many times during our last tour that we don't advertise enough or do enough publicity.  Unfortunately, we can't afford paid advertisements in the local press, nor are we able to travel to every single town or village we’re performing in to distribute publicity materials in advance.
After dancers' fees, accommodation is by far our second biggest outlay. Even with partial sponsorship for one location, we still need to find affordable accommodation for some other venues.
Please email Loretta at manager@jslndancecompany.com if you are able to, or may be interested in helping out with the following:

Helping with publicity for our performances by:
Distributing posters and flyers local to our show venues
Publicising the show via local press contacts
Publicising the show via social media sites


Accommodation for the company close to performance venues – there will be 10 dancers and our Artistic Director.If you have an affordable rental property which sleeps 11 or are able to put up the company within an hour’s drive of the following, we’d love to hear from you:
Bude, Cornwall
St Andrews
Gateshead
Sittingbourne



If you know of a dance school or group, regardless of age or ability who would like a workshop with our Artistic Director and company members, please let us know.

Then, of course, even if you can’t help with any of the above and aren’t in a position to contribute, please help to spread the word about JSLN Dance Company and of course this campaign.
Thank you!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>We are DanceAction, a contemporary dance company based in New York, led by Argentinian choreographer Carmen Caceres. We are currently receiving Fiscal Sponsorship from New York Live Arts. With our culturally diverse group of artists, together we create dance works that reflect critical issues in society. Our primary purpose is to interpret these issues and use our works to propel change.</p>
<p>While our work explores a broad variety of topics, our most recent piece “2 Minutes Hate,” reflects the political, social, and economic turmoil of the United States currently. This work, based on the novel “1984,” has been presented on several occasions in New York City.</p>
<p>DanceAction has been invited to perform “2 Minutes Hate” at Ticino in Danza. Ticino in Danza is a contemporary dance festival that takes place every summer in the Ticino region of Switzerland. The festival offers outdoor and site specific performances that melt into the natural landscapes, and the historical and urban sites of the region. Participating in this festival will give us the opportunity to connect with local, national, and international artists.</p>
<p>The Festival will kindly provide accommodation and local transportation. With your support we will be able to cover the additional travel expenses and compensation for 4 company members.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to take “2 Minutes Hate” abroad, and to make a social justice statement for an international artistic community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We need your help to make this happen! Our goal is to raise $5000. With these funds we will be able to cover rehearsal space rentals in New York City, airfares from New York to Switzerland, meals in Ticino, and compensation for 4 artists.</p>
<p>In exchange for your generous contribution, we would like to offer you a few very exciting gifts. Review the ""perks"" section of the site and you will have an opportunity to enjoy DanceAction merchandise, attend a rehearsal or get free tickets to our next local performance!</p>
<p>Please, make a tax-deductible donation to help us get to Switzerland.</p>
<p>Your support can make a huge impact! “2 Minutes Hate” reflects the current social, political, and economic turmoil of the United States in relationship to the world. Sharing our work in a festival of this scale will allow us to convey our message internationally, raising awareness about social justice.</p>
<p>As we are a young dance company in New York we face multiple challenges. Due to the latest budget cuts made to art organizations by the federal government, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, private funding has become a vital source of support for artists. In order to continue creating and performing new works of art, we need to develop a network of financial support. This will allow us to cover rehearsal costs, production materials, and more importantly, compensation for artists.</p>
<h3>Other ways you can help?</h3>
<p>All contributions are truly valuable for us, and there are multiple ways of helping! Please spread the word about this project and our company to your friends and family. Stay connected with DanceAction through social media and attending our local performances and events.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<p>My name is Renee Necole writer and producer of ""Bad Manners at the Dinner Table"", this production is a labor of love and dear to my heart. Being a writer is a gift and one that I take seriously. Each production that I produce has a direct message to its viewers. ""Bad Manners at the Dinner Table"" is no different as I strive to bring the awareness of judgement and assumption  in this theatrical comedy when one finds out what happens when you invite your sins to dinner.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help the cast of ""Bad Manners At The Dinner Table"" raise funds to attend the Tampa Bay Theater Festival in Tampa, Florida to perform and be acknowledged as the 2018 Nominee for Best Full Length Stage Play. </p>
<p>With your support, we are able to achieve new heights with this production, more exposure and the kick off to our 2018-2019 southern tour. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking to raise $6k for this trip. All funds will go towards the travel for our 16 member cast, lodging and per Diem.</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that each contributor will receive a number of amazing perks as a supporter of our cause!</p>
<p>Should we not reach our complete goal. The funds will go towards preparation for our Southern Tour which includes securing venues, marketing &amp; advertisement and cast travel.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<p>This production is not only comical, but meaningful. While depicting what sins looks like in the flesh it also brings awareness to the how one can judge another. As the old saying goes ""you can't judge a book by its cover"", life's circumstances leads us all in different paths. You can never know ones path unless you have walked in their shoes.</p>
<p>This award winning stage play has sold out several shows in the Charlotte, North Carolina and surrounding regions. From Chesapeake, VA to Clover, SC now heading to Herndon, VA and Tampa, FL, we are expanding and reaching the masses.</p>
<p>We are a traveling theater company that truly believes that ART is Ministry and we strive to convey this message in each production. Known for its intimate feel with dinner theater and small black box audiences, this production leaves one invested. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With a cast of 16 it can be quite difficult to find the funding without the support of our followers and those who believe in our mission. </p>
<p>We intend to continue to hold showcases in our region as well as benefit showcases to support local religious organizations seeking to enhance their ministry vision. These showcases allow us to build our fan base. However, without your support these challenges can remain a road block in our success. </p>
<p>Our biggest risk are lack of ticket purchases and lack of funding for travel.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We've all been blessed with two hands, ONE to help yourself and ONE to help others! WE NEED YOUR HELP. If you are unable to contribute monetary donations, we are always in need of help with sharing our mission and cause on your social media platforms, volunteering for registration at our events, crew for our showcases and marketing &amp; advertisement support.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2015, an idea to produce a show for the alumni of the Malverne High School musicals was born. In the 3 1/2 years since, the interest and framework has grown, but the finances have not. This campaign will help raise the money needed to secure rights, props, set materials, and other fees associated with a full-scale musical. </p>
<p>My name is Dave Coonan. I am the president of the Malverne Community Theatre and a Malverne High School alumni. After watching an MHS production a few years ago, I became nostalgic. I thought, ""Hey, how great would it be if we got together alumni from across the years to meet on the stage and put on a show once again?"" No strings attached. No ""greater cause"". Just do a show for the sake of doing a show. </p>
<p>Our goal is to have the performances of this show in August of 2019. At this point in time, the structure to produce a show is in place (the Malverne Community Theatre, a 501c3 organization that has the structure to deal with all the logistics that come with a show, is producing it), but we are still rallying people and trying to find the money that is needed to put on a show of this magnitude. </p>
<p>Everyone who has expressed interest in this show has fond memories of their time on the MHS stage, and are fully committed to bring that part of their lives back and share it with a brand new audience. There has been so much talent across that stage - what would it look like if we put them all together?</p>
<p>This campaign will help to fund this community-wide event. If you'd like to read more about the idea behind the production, please see this article from the Malverne Herald: <a href=""http://www.liherald.com/stories/locals-hope-to-form-alumni-musical-in-malverne,106905"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.liherald.com/stories/locals-hope-to-form-alumni-musical-in-malverne,106905</a></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>This campaign is asking for the modest amount of $2,000. Anyone who is familiar with staging a full-scale musical knows that this amount of money is laughable, as it will barely cover the rights to whatever show we do. But I am confident in the team that we are assembling to be able to make this happen on whatever budget we establish. Plus, I'm not greedy. And if we happen to raise more than $2,000, then every dollar more is a small victory. </p>
<p>The money will go towards the aforementioned rights, but also any props, costumes, set pieces, tickets, and other items associated with the production. </p>
<p>What you get in return for your contribution is your name in the program, on the website, on a sign at the production, and free tickets. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, it will be difficult to stage a musical. The money raised at that point will go towards an alternate production - but we don't want to think that way. </p>
<p>---</p>
</div><div><p>The impact of this production will be exponential for the school, the alumni network, the community, and the arts as a whole. This is an unprecedented event for our community. It bridges the gap between generations and will act as an inspiration to upcoming students to show how important the arts are in their lives. Every person who has graced that stage has been affected by it, and in turn, has developed a love for the theater arts that has only grown over time (myself especially included). </p></div><div>
<p>---</p>
<p>There is a chance that this production doesn't pan out exactly the way we all intended. That is a risk. It happens when lots of people, money, and logistics come together. Put a several-month long commitment on top of that and it makes the process even tougher. That's reality. However, I also know that the Malverne Community Theatre has a lot of fantastically talented people working with it, and I personally have been a guiding force in over 60 productions of all shapes and sizes. I feel very confident that whatever hurdles are thrown at us, we can succeed. As long as we have the people, we can do it. No successful production happens without a team. We have a good base, but we need the rest. </p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>New Fish A Musical has been in development for nearly 3 years and after countless workshops, readings, festival showings, we are ready to take it to a full production. Getting any new piece of theatre together is expensive, but musicals are especially costly and without a long run to make ticket sales from, we won't be able to cover the cost of production so we are asking for your help to get things moving and hopefully this is just the first step.</p>
<p>Our first fund raiser is in The Bath Pub on March 7th with Musical Bingo as well as pizza, a raffle with some great prizes and a few songs from a few friends. We are hoping to reach our target amount through a variety of means,  crowd funding as well as corporate sponsorship, advertising, musical theatre workshops and corporate events. Please feel free to get in touch with any queries.</p>
<p>New Fish A Musical is a story about young adults finding their place in the world; the challenges they are faced with and how these challenges affect their mental health. We follow Anna, a Dublin girl just graduated from Drama school in London, as she transitions into the real world pursuing her ambition to become a Musical Theatre actress and her friends who support her along the way.</p>
<p>An Irish original, bellowing shiny show tunes from the gritty world of the struggling artist with book by Grace O'Malley and music by Ross O'Connor. Co produced by Grace O'Malley and Karen Lee.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549535427/ir69cj8fuliko3zi2aqc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>We are determined to bring you a brand new quality production with all the bells and whistles. Your support will help us with cast and crew salaries along with the following:<br/><br/>Set<br/><br/>Lighting<br/><br/>Costumes<br/><br/>Sound<br/><br/>Print and advertising<br/><br/>Transport</p>
<p>Anything we reach over our target will go towards making this production even more fabulous!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>So why are we doing it? Why are we putting ourselves through the stress? There is no reason on earth for tackling such an illogical, irrational, plain stupid project such as getting a brand new musical to production in Dublin, other than an enormous love and belief in what we have created.</p>

Getting any new piece of theatre together is expensive, but musicals are especially costly and without a long run to make ticket sales from, we won't be able to cover the cost of production so we are asking for your help to get things moving and hopefully this is just the first step.
Our first fund raiser is in The Bath Pub on March 7th with Musical Bingo as well as pizza, a raffle with some great prizes and a few songs from a few friends. We are hoping to reach our target amount through a variety of means,  crowd funding as well as corporate sponsorship, advertising, musical theatre workshops and corporate events. Please feel free to get in touch with any queries.
New Fish A Musical is a story about young adults finding their place in the world; the challenges they are faced with and how these challenges affect their mental health. We follow Anna, a Dublin girl just graduated from Drama school in London, as she transitions into the real world pursuing her ambition to become a Musical Theatre actress and her friends who support her along the way.
An Irish original, bellowing shiny show tunes from the gritty world of the struggling artist with book by Grace O'Malley and music by Ross O'Connor. Co produced by Grace O'Malley and Karen Lee.

Funding
We are determined to bring you a brand new quality production with all the bells and whistles. Your support will help us with cast and crew salaries along with the following:SetLightingCostumesSoundPrint and advertisingTransport
Anything we reach over our target will go towards making this production even more fabulous!

Why?
So why are we doing it? Why are we putting ourselves through the stress? There is no reason on earth for tackling such an illogical, irrational, plain stupid project such as getting a brand new musical to production in Dublin, other than an enormous love and belief in what we have created.


THANK YOU!!!
We are asking for your help to get New Fish A Musical up on its’ fins. If you have ever thought of supporting the arts, here is your chance.  Thank you so much for your support, we are beyond grateful to you for your time and consideration.XXX

<h3>About the Show</h3>
<p>Maude, a middle-aged unemployed bartender from Bakersfield, California, purchased a painting from a local thrift store for only a few bucks. Now she's convinced the painting is a long-lost Jackson Pollock masterpiece worth millions!  Lionel, an expert from New York City, flies over to her trailer park home to authenticate the artwork, but what they discover is far beyond what either could have ever imagined.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Off Broadway West Theatre Company is a small, award-winning, San Francisco-based non-profit. Founded in 2006, OBW strives to awaken audiences to an expanded worldview with productions of great theatre classics alongside new works from emerging playwrights. It is our mission at OBW to promote the continued development of theatre while presenting plays that will inspire you to think, laugh, and give you something to talk about long after the stage lights go down.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p><strong>We seek $10,000 to help fund this production.</strong> As a non-profit, all of the money ends up on the stage in one way or another.  Our total production costs will amount to at least $21,000.</p>
<p>Estimated Budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production Crew - $5,000</li>
<li>Actors - $2,000</li>
<li>Theatre Rental - $6,000</li>
<li>Set, Costumes, Lighting - $3,000</li>
<li>Marketing, royalties, and printing - $5,000</li>
<li><strong>Total Production Cost - $21,000</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our Total Production Income will never cover these expenses. </p>
<h3>Why this Show?</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>Who ultimately gets to decide what is true and what is false? In a world filled with fake news, we are constantly challenged to figure out if what we are seeing is truthfully depicted. <i>Bakersfield Mist </i>directly questions authenticity in art, and by extension, our relationships to one another. </li>
<li>We have been producing for ten years and have garnered terrific reviews and awards for our honest and fresh approach to modern and classical plays.  We're delighted to develop this excellent piece!</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The life of an independent theatrical company can be precarious. Though our shows are very well received and attended, the costs of production necessarily exceed the income we can earn at the box office. We are not grant-supported. Thus, we must rely on the help of the community. Because we are a 501(c)(3) non-profit, all contributions to Off Broadway West are fully tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help!</h3>
<p>We get it. There are lots of demands on your time and money; not everybody can afford to contribute. You can still help us by sharing our campaign via email and on social media. Please tell all your friends, and use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<h3>The Grenfell Project</h3>
<p>This project started as a show for our final year of our Acting and Performance course at the University for the Creative Arts, where ""The Grenfell Project"" was been showcased at the Farnham Maltings and the Marylebone Theatre in Shepherds Bush as a piece of devised work.Through personal testimony and verbatim theatre techniques we performed this as our final year show.</p>
<p>A few of us decided that this is to important a topic to give up there and are aiming to tour the show so that we can spread the message across the UK. There are still over 3,000 apartment blocks around the country that are still covered in the cladding that cause the Grenfell tragedy to be so severe due to its flammability. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We already have one show booked at The Bread and Roses Theatre in Clapham, but we wish to continue touring so we can reach as many people as possible. This is how donating to our show will help us tour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Booking influential and popular theatres that will encourage and support our show whilst bringing people into the venue through the venue's prestige.</li>
<li>Booking rehearsal space for the cast and director to work.</li>
<li>Buying webspace for advertisements and links to our shows</li>
<li>Printing leaflets and flyers as well as programmes so all our lovely cast and crew can be credited.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the past, the community of Kensington and Chelsea has been divided by those who are stereotyped as being deprived financially and those who are not, with this poverty profile being a defining factor in their treatment by their council. Through this performance of testimony - from Ladbroke Grove residents, rescuers and some of our own experiences - we wish to inform the public on how and why this disaster is seen as an act of incompetence and greed. We aim to tour our piece so that a widespread message can be communicated, whilst educating those in schools and youth centers about the decisions that caused the fire, in hopes to create a more supportive generation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A topic such a Grenfell is an ethical conundrum. We wish to fairly portray everyone involved in this tragedy whilst trying to obtain justice for the residents of the community. Verbatim theatre has had a recent surge in popularity and with many moral issues up for debate it is important as aspiring artists to experiment and find our path to a fair and inclusive performance. As actors, it is important for us to explore how to fairly represent those whose experiences we are bringing to the spotlight and being respectful of their misfortune. We also have the job of revealing faults in the councils support for those at Grenfell whilst not attacking them on a personal level. </p>

<p>It means we have a cutting-edge dance performance live onstage and in Virtual Reality. Through fresh contemporary choreography, the movement of talented dancers will be followed by motion-captioning sensors, virtual reality headsets and digital avatars to create an immersive, blow-your-mind experience between man and machine. The performance is the first of its kind, offering a live showing in VR -- “Virtual Theater” -- and onstage in a physical theater. Yes -- the show will also be LIVE in VR, viewable from anywhere on the globe with a headset.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Golem will feature powerful choreography synergized with motion-capture VR technology to develop a stimulating visual experience. But the narrative goes even further than that.</p>
<p>The story centers on the concept of the self: the body in its physical and digital forms. Through contemporary dance, a fleshy human figure discovers its virtual data-body via the motion capture system. A non-linear narrative of subjectivity arises, reflective of the digital trends present in our current technosphere: vanity, narcissism, and a curation of the digitalized body. The avatar will vie and dance with it’s human creator.</p>
<p>The story ultimately hinges on the link between physical and digitized bodies: can the physical self stay autonomous? Or are we forever linked to our digital form?</p>

<h3>The Collaborators</h3>
<p>Golem pulls together visionaries across industry and academia. We have a cast of 5 dancers and more than 20 creatives spanning the fields of dance, performance philosophy, virtual design, sound engineering, computer philosophy, and lighting and stage design involved.  </p>
<p>Together, a cross-disciplinary team from gamelab.berlin (of Humboldt Universität zu Berlin), the Virtual Design Lab of Kaiserslautern Hochschule, and Carly Lave forged in December 2018 to envision new methodologies of using motion-capture technology and virtual reality in a performance space.</p>
<p><strong>Sound</strong>: We are honored to feature the sound of <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/modularprincess"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ose (Arushi Jain)</a> for the performance. As ose, Arushi brings out the vibrancy of Hindustani classical in modern electronica, primarily using modular synthesizers and her voice to craft ambient microtonal textures emphasized with distorted rhythm and disorienting glitch. Arushi is the founder of <a href=""http://www.ghunghru.fm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ghunghru</a>, a experimental record label &amp; radio series based out of San Francisco and a graduate of Stanford University.  </p>
<p><strong>Design &amp; Film</strong>: Golem’s visual art and design is in collaboration with Indexthumb (William Hamilton), an experimental visual artist focused on combining alchemical/dream imagery and sci-fi aesthetics in film, photography, and design</p>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The scale of this project is massive and involves an array of artists, storytelling professionals, and dancers. And of course all of the state-of-the-art technology (cables, multiple computers, VR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs), and the like). In order to accomplish this, <strong>We need your help bringing this production to life! </strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554923085/m624n5v0y4kljdrc81ja.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The funds for the execution of the project are the primary challenge we are facing at the moment. Contributions we collect will be arranged to cover various parts of the project, as all are interdependent to pull off the production. Given the expertise and pioneering technologies used in Golem, we need to raise <strong>at least $25K </strong>to cover our base costs. </p>
<p><strong>Where is that money going?? Here's a quick breakdown of some of our costs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$10 - One hr of rehearsal space (we rehearse 3 x week, 2-3 hrs per session)</li>
<li>$200 - Costume materials and construction for one body </li>
<li>$500 - Rehearsal space for the project</li>
<li>$700 - Artist fee for Lighting Designing (we also have a costume designer &amp; visual designer ;)</li>
<li>$1200 - Compensation of one dancer for the project</li>
<li>$2000 - Lighting Rental, Installation, Labor for one week in theater</li>
<li>$5000 - Performance Venue rental</li>
</ul>
<p>As patrons of the arts, we wish to be transparent with you about this, and feel that openness is better for all parties. We are working insanely hard to develop the first phase of the project as low-cost and budget-friendly as possible.</p>
<p>We have developed amazing perks that will put you on the front lines of this amazing project - you can get everything from Golem stickers to dance lessons from Carly, or a seat in the VR theatre in July. We want you to feel proud to be part of Golem as much as we are.</p>
</div><div><h3>The Support</h3></div><div>
<p>Our ambition is high, we know. But we are eager to bring the next wave of art &amp; technology to the masses. We are fervent believers in the power of the people, which is why we believe in our community to help us reach this goal and support the next wave of groundbreaking art &amp; tech.</p>
<p>Golem is an attempt to reckon with humanity’s engagement with digital technologies, confronting the body-machine relationship through movement of the body itself. Did we mention that the performance will be viewable live in VR?!</p>
<p>We also know that not everyone will have the means to donate. If you are able to share support in other acts of loving kindness, we would super appreciate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing the campaign link with your friends via email, text, social media - every dollar counts</li>
<li>Talk about Golem online - share the visuals (i.e the campaign videos) for promotion</li>
<li>Follow Carly on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/carly.lave"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/carlylave__/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> for production updates that could be relevant to you - (maybe we even tour Golem to your part of the world!)</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, your support in whichever form, means the world -- both the physical and virtual <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554923085/m624n5v0y4kljdrc81ja.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554923085/m624n5v0y4kljdrc81ja.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

The funds for the execution of the project are the primary challenge we are facing at the moment. Contributions we collect will be arranged to cover various parts of the project, as all are interdependent to pull off the production. Given the expertise and pioneering technologies used in Golem, we need to raise at least $25K to cover our base costs. 
Where is that money going?? Here's a quick breakdown of some of our costs:

$10 - One hr of rehearsal space (we rehearse 3 x week, 2-3 hrs per session)
$200 - Costume materials and construction for one body 
$500 - Rehearsal space for the project
$700 - Artist fee for Lighting Designing (we also have a costume designer & visual designer ;)
$1200 - Compensation of one dancer for the project
$2000 - Lighting Rental, Installation, Labor for one week in theater
$5000 - Performance Venue rental

As patrons of the arts, we wish to be transparent with you about this, and feel that openness is better for all parties. We are working insanely hard to develop the first phase of the project as low-cost and budget-friendly as possible.
We have developed amazing perks that will put you on the front lines of this amazing project - you can get everything from Golem stickers to dance lessons from Carly, or a seat in the VR theatre in July. We want you to feel proud to be part of Golem as much as we are.
The Support
Our ambition is high, we know. But we are eager to bring the next wave of art & technology to the masses. We are fervent believers in the power of the people, which is why we believe in our community to help us reach this goal and support the next wave of groundbreaking art & tech.
Golem is an attempt to reckon with humanity’s engagement with digital technologies, confronting the body-machine relationship through movement of the body itself. Did we mention that the performance will be viewable live in VR?!
We also know that not everyone will have the means to donate. If you are able to share support in other acts of loving kindness, we would super appreciate:

Sharing the campaign link with your friends via email, text, social media - every dollar counts
Talk about Golem online - share the visuals (i.e the campaign videos) for promotion
Follow Carly on Facebook and Instagram for production updates that could be relevant to you - (maybe we even tour Golem to your part of the world!)

In any case, your support in whichever form, means the world -- both the physical and virtual

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hello! My name is Candice, I am an aerialist/performing artist based in Northampton, MA. I have been training and performing professionally for the past seven years and look forward to many more! There is great excitement and joy found in both performing and viewing shows where the artists are able to captivate the audience entirely. Northampton and the surrounding areas are filled with an immense amount of unique talent, but lack an equal amount of opportunity to share them. It has been a great hope of mine to be able to create a platform in which performing artists may showcase their gifts in the form of a Vaudeville style variety show entitled “Vaudeville in the Valley”.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need (am hoping for)</strong></p>
<p>I have set a goal of $3,000.</p>
<p>If this goal is met, the funding will go to the following:</p>
<p>1. Artists involved in the show</p>
<p>2. Venue Rental</p>
<p>3. Production Costs (lighting, sound, marketing materials)</p>
<p>Anyone who wishes to be mentioned for their donation is welcome to be listed in our show brochure.</p>
<p>Truly, any support is greatly appreciated. Even if the goal is not reached my main focus is to pay the performers their professional compensation. I take great pride in what I do and look forward to putting on a fantastic show that can be appreciated by many.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Art is created to be appreciated and that is exactly what this show aims to do. We are introducing a unique form of entertainment to a community that is bound to adore it. This show is the first of its kind at the chosen venue, The Northampton Center for the Arts.</p>
<p>On a personal note, choosing to produce a show of this kind to create a platform for others is not only a large commitment, but also a terrifying endeavor. It would mean to world to me (and many others) to be able to financially support an incredible show to be shared.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, a successful show creates new opportunities for artists, </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>First impressions are key, correct? Well, being that this show is the first of it's kind in this area, I have high hopes of creating an excellent first impression to the show scene. Without the proper funding for an event like this, it could so easily flop. For example, artist's performances need to be highlighted with professional lighting and accompanied by a professional sound tech to display the artist's work to it's best potential. Creating a mood, and the correct setting for this kind of show is key. </p>
<p>As an artist myself I will do my best to acquire all that is needed to make this show fantastic, from the welcoming of the guests to the final bow, I am up for the challenge.</p>

</ul>
<div>Dinaka/Kiba
music and dance or <i>mmino wa setšo </i>as
is known among rural communities in Limpopo province, South Africa; is an
important heritage from pre-colonial Southern Africa. While there is progress
in as far as developing the art-form is concerned, a lot more still needs to be
done to research, develop and preserve Dinaka/Kiba music and dance<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> <li>Campaign description and why it's important</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Dinaka/Kiba is an important heritage from pre-colonial Southern Africa. In spite the fact that the music is one of the oldest indigenous genres in Southern Africa, the art form continues to struggle to make an impact in the lives of communities due to structural challenges. The festival is strategically designed to re-engineer the art form by dealing with structural challenges in a quest to ensure that Dinaka/Kiba artists benefit economically from their talents.<br/><br/>
</div>
<ul> <li>How your funds can help achieve the goal.</li> </ul>
<div><br/></div> <p></p>
<div>The organisers wish to make this an annual ‘school’, humbly asking what defines a festival and what can it do for public space. With kind support from the <a href=""http://nac.org.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Arts Council of South Africa</a> this year(2014), the festival aims to set the tone for proposed future developmental initiatives alongside the festival. This includes amongst many; research projects aimed at using scientific inquiry to identify problems towards innovative solutions. </div>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>How much we need</li>
</ul>
<div>We want to raise at least twenty thousand US dollars for the second year going forward. The money will help us relive the memory of a neglected heritage site(abandoned in 1964 when the former apartheid government forcefully removed residents)  where Dinaka/Kiba practitioners used to perform and socialize by designing culturally relevant structures which will serve as a Cultural Center of annual performance, pedagogy, social science research, cooperative economics, knowledge sharing and community development.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><span><ul><li><span>Unique perks for our funders!</span></li></ul></span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are in the process of <a href=""http://wp.me/a2ne71-8H"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">registering a cooperative </a>that will help Dinaka/Kiba practitioners deal with structural challenges. Once the cooperative is registered, we will be inviting people to buy <a href=""http://wp.me/a2ne71-8F"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shares</a>(an initial 20%) and help the cooperative grow and give a Return on Investment(ROI) for investors. Anyone above from 18 years can  sign up as a member. <p>Application for membership and for the number of shares an
application wishes to take up shall be made on the form provided for that
purpose, and shall be accompanied by the entrance fee.</p>
<p>A <a href=""http://wp.me/a2ne71-8G"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">share certificate</a>(as per the cooperative constitution) shall be issued in the relevant form.</p>
<p>On visit funders will be welcomed by local traditional leadership, cultural practitioners, community leaders and treated to Indigenous music, dance, food, colorful costumes and souvenirs to take home. </p>

<div>As per the constitution, the funds will go into the cooperative's reserve funds if the entire goal is not reached.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>Why project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.</li>
</ul>
<div><p>There are quite
a handful of research publications on the philosophical foundations,
theoretical paradigmatic approaches for Indigenous Knowledge Systems research,
ethnographic and descriptive analyses of Indigenous music genres (see <a href=""http://africarts.org/Artists/Nketia.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nketia </a>
1992; Pewa 1997; <a href=""http://www.mekinzewi.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nzewi</a> 2007; Mapaya 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014; <a href=""http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sowetan/archive/2010/04/30/welcome-doctor-galane"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Galane</a> 2009). Yet
very little is written on the entrance and active participation of Indigenous
music genres, in particular Dinaka/Kiba dance and music groups into the
mainstream economy given the general consensus that this genre and other
related are isolated and often marginalized. During the plenary session in
2013, President Jacob Zuma addressed parliament in a statement addressing the
BRICS Summit theme <i>BRICS and Africa: Partnership for Development, Integration
and Industrialization</i>. In his words, “the Knowledge Economy needs to be a
learning economy as we and other emerging markets and developing countries
shift from primary to industrial production, notably to enjoy beneficiation, to
the supply of modern services”. The president’s utterances are important
looking at rapid changes to the economy brought in by major drivers such as
technology. For politicians, economists and many others in related disciplines,
addressing issues of development and the production of modern services has
become synonymous with a concept such as the knowledge economy. But what does
the knowledge economy mean for the Arts and Culture sector?</p></div>
<ul> <li>Success story</li>
</ul>
<div>In 2013, an application was submitted to the National Arts Council of South Africa for funding to hot the first Dinaka/Kiba Festival in Ga Molepo. The application was successful and a budget was allocated for the event. The event will be held as follows:</div>
<div>Date: 29 November 2014</div>
<div>Venue: Theology Sports Ground Mankgaile village, Ga Molepo, Polokwane</div>
<div>Time: 09:00 AM-17:00 PM South African time</div>
<div> We hope to make this event an ""annual school"", hence need more funding and sponsorship to grow the event. </div>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul> <li>Overcoming our hurdles</li>
</ul>
<div>

This campaign is in response to the current material conditions in which
practitioners of Dinaka/Kiba music and dance find themselves in mainly due to
the marginalization of these indigenous art forms by a society that has since
embraced more modern kinds of genres such as jazz and the fact that there are
notably fundamental problems regarding the focus of traditional music
scholarship in academic fields such as ethnomusicology and musicology as the
reader will notice in the literature review section to follow. In spite the
fact that indigenous music and related genres are the oldest art forms on the
African continent, the practitioners continue to fall by the roadside when it comes
to the production, packaging, marketing and selling of quality goods and
services; which are in some cases; non existent. We foresee our engagement of
African musicology through our field experience with Dinaka/Kiba music and dance
groups and through academe (Information Science) as a noble and unique entrance
into the music research enterprise since the early days of participation by
anthropologists and later on ethnologists and sociologists. <br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>An ideal typical revamped Dinaka/Kiba music and dance group should be
registered as a Co-Operative(<a href=""http://www.cipc.co.za/index.php/register-your-business/co-operatives/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CIPC</a>, 2005), have all members inaugurated as
board members with the executive divided into a chairperson, secretary, treasurer,
communications officer, marketing officer and other office bearers. This legal
form of business will help Dinaka/Kiba music and dance groups observe the legal
rights and ownership framework post 1994; where according to Galane (2009: 16) it
can also help counter “the extend which it fails to protect the development of
indigenous musical arts, South Africa’s musicians as well as its concomitant
non protection of artists in the recording industry of South Africa”.</p>
<br/>
</div>
<ul> <li>Our five year plan .</li> </ul>
<div>We
plan to acquire at least 10 hectares (15 000 m2) of land from traditional
authorities in Ga Molepo. With the advice and help of architects and space
design professionals we can design low rate culturally significant structures
to be used for shelter during festivals. <span>These
structures will assume a permanent life in the community, to be used throughout
the year for similar and other events. Over a three year period, we can safely
look at these structures as 'campuses' for an informally structured 'periodic'
school that is the annual festival. Here we are asking what a festival can do
for its environmental location as well as investigating whether the idea of an
Independent Arts and Culture Comprehensive school can happen; in a place that
is distinct from the hosts of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival,
Maphungubwe Arts Festival and others. In other words, by so doing; we would be
asking pertinent questions like: how does a festival take an overt cultural,

Dinaka/Kiba
music and dance or mmino wa setšo as
is known among rural communities in Limpopo province, South Africa; is an
important heritage from pre-colonial Southern Africa. While there is progress
in as far as developing the art-form is concerned, a lot more still needs to be
done to research, develop and preserve Dinaka/Kiba music and dance


 Campaign description and why it's important


Dinaka/Kiba is an important heritage from pre-colonial Southern Africa. In spite the fact that the music is one of the oldest indigenous genres in Southern Africa, the art form continues to struggle to make an impact in the lives of communities due to structural challenges. The festival is strategically designed to re-engineer the art form by dealing with structural challenges in a quest to ensure that Dinaka/Kiba artists benefit economically from their talents.

 How your funds can help achieve the goal. 
 
The organisers wish to make this an annual ‘school’, humbly asking what defines a festival and what can it do for public space. With kind support from the National Arts Council of South Africa this year(2014), the festival aims to set the tone for proposed future developmental initiatives alongside the festival. This includes amongst many; research projects aimed at using scientific inquiry to identify problems towards innovative solutions. 
   What We Need & What You Get  How much we need

We want to raise at least twenty thousand US dollars for the second year going forward. The money will help us relive the memory of a neglected heritage site(abandoned in 1964 when the former apartheid government forcefully removed residents)  where Dinaka/Kiba practitioners used to perform and socialize by designing culturally relevant structures which will serve as a Cultural Center of annual performance, pedagogy, social science research, cooperative economics, knowledge sharing and community development.

Unique perks for our funders!

We are in the process of registering a cooperative that will help Dinaka/Kiba practitioners deal with structural challenges. Once the cooperative is registered, we will be inviting people to buy Shares(an initial 20%) and help the cooperative grow and give a Return on Investment(ROI) for investors. Anyone above from 18 years can  sign up as a member. Application for membership and for the number of shares an
application wishes to take up shall be made on the form provided for that
purpose, and shall be accompanied by the entrance fee.
A share certificate(as per the cooperative constitution) shall be issued in the relevant form.
On visit funders will be welcomed by local traditional leadership, cultural practitioners, community leaders and treated to Indigenous music, dance, food, colorful costumes and souvenirs to take home. 
Also take home studio recorded debut CD titled modimo wa fase(released 2012) by Molepo Traditional Dance Group.


 Reserve fund just in case we dont reach target. 
As per the constitution, the funds will go into the cooperative's reserve funds if the entire goal is not reached.
   The Impact  Why project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.

There are quite
a handful of research publications on the philosophical foundations,
theoretical paradigmatic approaches for Indigenous Knowledge Systems research,
ethnographic and descriptive analyses of Indigenous music genres (see Nketia 
1992; Pewa 1997; Nzewi 2007; Mapaya 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014; Galane 2009). Yet
very little is written on the entrance and active participation of Indigenous
music genres, in particular Dinaka/Kiba dance and music groups into the
mainstream economy given the general consensus that this genre and other
related are isolated and often marginalized. During the plenary session in
2013, President Jacob Zuma addressed parliament in a statement addressing the
BRICS Summit theme BRICS and Africa: Partnership for Development, Integration
and Industrialization. In his words, “the Knowledge Economy needs to be a
learning economy as we and other emerging markets and developing countries
shift from primary to industrial production, notably to enjoy beneficiation, to
the supply of modern services”. The president’s utterances are important
looking at rapid changes to the economy brought in by major drivers such as
technology. For politicians, economists and many others in related disciplines,
addressing issues of development and the production of modern services has
become synonymous with a concept such as the knowledge economy. But what does
the knowledge economy mean for the Arts and Culture sector?
 Success story

In 2013, an application was submitted to the National Arts Council of South Africa for funding to hot the first Dinaka/Kiba Festival in Ga Molepo. The application was successful and a budget was allocated for the event. The event will be held as follows:
Date: 29 November 2014
Venue: Theology Sports Ground Mankgaile village, Ga Molepo, Polokwane
Time: 09:00 AM-17:00 PM South African time
 We hope to make this event an ""annual school"", hence need more funding and sponsorship to grow the event.

   Risks & Challenges  Overcoming our hurdles



This campaign is in response to the current material conditions in which
practitioners of Dinaka/Kiba music and dance find themselves in mainly due to
the marginalization of these indigenous art forms by a society that has since
embraced more modern kinds of genres such as jazz and the fact that there are
notably fundamental problems regarding the focus of traditional music
scholarship in academic fields such as ethnomusicology and musicology as the
reader will notice in the literature review section to follow. In spite the
fact that indigenous music and related genres are the oldest art forms on the
African continent, the practitioners continue to fall by the roadside when it comes
to the production, packaging, marketing and selling of quality goods and
services; which are in some cases; non existent. We foresee our engagement of
African musicology through our field experience with Dinaka/Kiba music and dance
groups and through academe (Information Science) as a noble and unique entrance
into the music research enterprise since the early days of participation by
anthropologists and later on ethnologists and sociologists. 


An ideal typical revamped Dinaka/Kiba music and dance group should be
registered as a Co-Operative(CIPC, 2005), have all members inaugurated as
board members with the executive divided into a chairperson, secretary, treasurer,
communications officer, marketing officer and other office bearers. This legal
form of business will help Dinaka/Kiba music and dance groups observe the legal
rights and ownership framework post 1994; where according to Galane (2009: 16) it
can also help counter “the extend which it fails to protect the development of
indigenous musical arts, South Africa’s musicians as well as its concomitant
non protection of artists in the recording industry of South Africa”.


 Our five year plan . 
We
plan to acquire at least 10 hectares (15 000 m2) of land from traditional
authorities in Ga Molepo. With the advice and help of architects and space
design professionals we can design low rate culturally significant structures
to be used for shelter during festivals. These
structures will assume a permanent life in the community, to be used throughout
the year for similar and other events. Over a three year period, we can safely
look at these structures as 'campuses' for an informally structured 'periodic'
school that is the annual festival. Here we are asking what a festival can do
for its environmental location as well as investigating whether the idea of an
Independent Arts and Culture Comprehensive school can happen; in a place that
is distinct from the hosts of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival,
Maphungubwe Arts Festival and others. In other words, by so doing; we would be
asking pertinent questions like: how does a festival take an overt cultural,
political and economic position?

So, for the amounts of the two years(2014/2015)
strategic plan budget, we can buy affordable material such as stainless steel,
sand, cement, rocks, grass and wood (some of which can be sourced for free in
the community) to design permanent infrastructure of great artistic merit, and
use the remainder to pay for labour (in the form of community builders and
constructors and workshops on design and architecture from expertise). Indeed,
we could also apply for in-kind sponsorship for these materials to build
sustainable, permanent infrastructure, thus using the bulk of the money for
workshops and labour costs, a contribution to human resources stimulated by the
festival itself.
   Other Ways You Can Help  Asking you help make noise about this campaign.

The initiators of the festival collectively are interested in poetry, visual art, architecture, oral history, agriculture, cooperative economics and technology. We hope that the festival is a fertile ground for community members, learners, educators, artists, scientists, business people and the general public to realise innovative and ethical experiments as a contribution to a vibrant and thriving society. Help us get the word out.

<p></p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>We hope to field up to 20 horses and riders on the day, but all their logistical and administrative costs need to be covered.</p>
<p>We hope to raise at least £150,000 (£5000 per horse and rider + taxes, charges and contingency) beyond which all surplus funds will benefit our chosen charities.</p>
<p>All donations, large or small, will bring us closer to achieving our goal and to helping our chosen charities.</p>

<p>October 2014 </p>
<p>I was commissioned into The Royal Scots Greys in 1965 on the 150th Anniversary of Waterloo -- now 50 years on, the importance of the Victory at the Battle of Waterloo is un-diminished. </p>
<p>This coming year we commemorate the 200th Anniversary of The Battle of Waterloo. For our Regiment, now known as The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, Waterloo remains our main Battle Honour and The Eagle of the 45th French Infantry is still proudly worn as our cap badge. The treasured Eagle Standard captured by Sergeant Ewart is displayed in our Edinburgh Castle Museum, reminding us all of that famous Charge of the Union Brigade and sadly the 189 Regimental Soldiers who bravely gave their lives for King and Country. Their extraordinary courage continues to inspire the modern day Troopers who willingly risk their lives in the interests of World Peace, in the many challenging operational situations of today. </p>
<p>My Waterloo 200 Committee fully supports The GREYS &amp; GLORY initiative championed by the War Horse Foundation, to pay formal tribute to those who fell at Waterloo. ""</p>

<p><i>""The Greys and Glory ride at Waterloo 200 should be a once in a lifetime opportunity to take recreate military history.  Profits from the ride will go towards charity.  ABF The Soldiers’ Charity (originally the Army Benevolent Fund, since creation in 1944) is the national charity of the British Army.  The charity looks after all soldiers, veterans (young and old) and their families when in need.  Our youngest beneficiary is a 5-month old child, the oldest a 107-year-old widow of a veteran.  Whether a soldier from World War Two, Korea, the Falklands, Northern Ireland, Iraq of Afghanistan (and many other campaigns besides), the Army’s charity provides the backbone of support typically to over 5000 individuals and families annually. No two families or situations are the same, but to those concerned the charity’s help can be little short of life-changing.  Poignantly, amongst these ranks are of course regimental descendants of Waterloo’s Scots Greys – today’s Royal Scots Dragoon Guards.</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you for your donation to Greys and Glory.  Any profits from the ride will go towards charity, which will allow us to help soldiers, veterans and families from World War Two to recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.</i></p>
<p><i>Good luck to all the riders taking part at Waterloo 200!”</i></p>

<p><b>WHERE WILL THE FUNDS BE SPENT?</b></p>
<p>Your support of Greys &amp; Glory will help and assist us in finding suitable grey horses to participate at the Waterloo commemorations, manufacture additional uniforms and bearskins caps of the era, gauntlets, equipment and accoutrements for horse and rider.  </p>
<p>Some items we have in stock and needs fluffing and repairs while many others will need to be manufactured.  </p>
<p><b>Relive the charge of the Greys! </b></p>
<p><span>The horses will need to be transported from around Western Europe to Belgium, cared for, fed and trained as a unit. </span></p>
<p><span>We have ambitious goals and with your help we hope we can present up to 30 Royal Scots Greys as they were in 1815 and participate in the five days at Waterloo 200.</span></p>

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need these funds to secure suitable grey horses from the local region of Scotland, England, Wales, France, Germany, Belgium and or Holland, to train, drill, and transport to Waterloo, Belgium.  These horses will be privately owned, loaned or rented. They will need medical clearances by Veterinarians with proper certification clearances to cross borders in order to be at Waterloo 2015. All of the horses will need to be transported to Waterloo several days before the event, boarded and cared for. Horses need constant support personnel to be exercised, groomed and trained. This support involves grooms and extra hands to make sure the horses are always safe.</p>
<p><b>For You as a Donor!</b></p>
<p>By contributing to GREYS &amp; GLORY, we have some amazing and unique PERKS with special access to functions at the higher levels. Please explore our PERK LIST below for more details.</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago, individuals founded and funded cavalry regiments. Cavalry regiments were historically pricier than infantry regiments, and they still are today. Officers back then, purchased their rank, and these funds helped pay for the regiment. We are hoping that you can help raise the 1815 ROYAL SCOTS GREYS this same way. By your level of donation, you are ""purchasing"" your honorary rank as part of the 1815 ROYAL SCOTS GREYS.  Your name will be listed in the DONOR RANK LIST under your level of donation. The list will be displayed in highest rank to lowest rank. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will
be operating a Prize Draw, into which the names of all donors, received both on and off line and
including those who wish to remain anonymous, will be entered, however the Terms and Conditions of Indiegogo do not

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>
<i>How can we possibly rebuild a cavalry regiment from two hundred years ago?</i><p>We have cavalry experience and many have military experience from their time in THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS along with discipline and training<i>.  </i>The War Horse Foundation has been presenting cavalry regiments and blending horses, riders and uniforms for 15 years. The Foundation has appeared in over 150 parades, as well as festivals, civic events and 25 schools.</p>
<p>All of the riders joining the GREYS &amp; GLORY campaign, are experienced riders, however we plan to hold training days for the horses and riders to prepare for the event. </p>
<p>War Horse trains every week as a mounted unit. Several of the former officers of THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS regularly ride and many have their own horses as well. Together, with our combined experience we should be able to quickly create a cohesive unit.</p>
<p>We will make our best efforts to achieve our goals, but if we do not have the full financial resources available, we will have to scale our scope of the  project. Other risks include weather, force-majeure or unforeseen obstacles or decisions made by the organisers of the event which could alter or curtail our plans. We also are working with horses that have natural inherent risks and potential unpredictable reactions to stimulus. All the donations are non refundable and will be spent on program costs with surplus amounts going to the designated charities.</p>
<p><i>This is a lifetime dream for many of us; to present and share the 1815 ROYAL SCOTS GREYS and commemorate the valour and sacrifice by this regiment at Waterloo. We are honoured to present the GREYS for the first time in 200 years at Waterloo and hopefully at events in the UK as well. </i></p>
<div>
<b>How your donations will be applied......</b><span>.</span><p>The majority of the funds will go to finding quality grey horses, suitable for the ceremony, presentations and the battle reenactment at Waterloo. This includes rental of the horses, insurance, transportation, feed, box stalls, vet care, shoeing, grooms, health inspections, equine documentation, tack, equipment, shipping. We also need to cover the cost of tentage, food for the teams, travel, transportation of equipment , insurance and uniforms. We already have a dozen Scots Grey 1815 uniforms which we have been using for fifteen years. Some of these will need some refurbishing and we will need additional uniforms to ensure that all riders are kitted out. Additional bearskin caps, weather covers for bearskins, campaign breeches, accoutrements, extra bearskins, should straps and pouches. We also will have horse trailer transport trucks &amp; drivers, ground crew and support team to take care of and their sustenance to cover.</p>
<p>All surplus funds, after administrative and logistical costs have been covered, will go 80% to ABF The Soldiers' Charity and 20%  Scotty's Little Soldiers.</p>

<p><b>Who is Riding?</b></p>
<p>Several retired officers from the regiment, enthusiasts and a group from the War Horse Foundation. We recruit experienced riders who need to handle a variety of situations with horses. We have men and women regularly train and  ride in the troop. All of the women that ride with us, hide their gender to appear as male troopers; just as the famous Mother Ross did with the Scots Greys one hundred years before Waterloo. THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS are very proud of the history and heritage of Mother Ross's exploits in battle as a SCOTS GREY and proudly recognise her in the regimental histories. The Regiment also recognises the value of diversity in the military today and the  Mother Ross's that may serve in the military today and in the future.</p>

<p>The riders are mostly based in the US &amp; UK, but several are living throughout Europe as well. There is a shared knowledge overlap of the training and skills needed for this campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What if you do not raise the full amount? </b></p>
<p>Any amount of funding will help us in our goals in even a small way. We are determined to go to Waterloo, even with just a small footprint. There has never been a SCOTS GREY riding on the fields of Waterloo since the famous battle... Ideally we can make a proper presentation, worthy of the accomplishments of the ROYAL SCOTS GREYS.  We have already spent hundreds of hours planning this journey and are determined to give honour to the regiment. </p>
<p>Once we have covered our logistical and administrative costs, any remaining funds left over will go to ABF The Soldiers' Charity &amp; Scotty's Little Soldiers.</p>

<blockquote><div>
<p></p>
<p>""I served in the Regiment over 20 years ago, as a Captain and Squadron Second-in-Command. And what an amazing Regiment in which to serve! Scotland's senior Regiment; Scotland's only cavalry Regiment; the Regiment's Colonel-in-Chief is none other than Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II; the Regiment boasts one of the most impressive lists of battle honours of all British Regiments; even the Pipes and Drums of The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards have achieved worldwide fame, winning numerous awards and holding the N°1 spot in the UK music charts for weeks on end! Everything about the Regiment breathes professionalism, courage, tradition and accomplishment. It truly is a Regiment which is Second to None.</p>
<p>However, you would have thought that, with so many accolades, the Regiment could afford to field its own troops at the Waterloo reenactment, but this is sadly not the case. The Regiment may have been one of the lucky few to have survived the recent volley of amalgamations and disbandments, but it has been equally hit by the cut-backs, both in terms of budget and autonomy. The World is getting smaller and the changing threat calls for changing roles and tactics. Already the Regiment is downsizing from Challenger II tanks to light armoured vehicles and there is no guarantee that The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards will remain untouched and intact should another round of defence cuts scythe through centuries of history and tradition. </p>Ironically, the Regiment's conversion to lighter vehicles and its move back to Scotland both coincide with the bicentenary of Waterloo, the Regiment's most famous battle honour – another reason why the Regiment is counting upon us to represent The Greys at the Waterloo in 2015. And we are counting upon you to help us make it happen!Greys and Glory is much more than just a handful of riders dressing up and playing soldiers for a day or two. It is the opportunity to showcase the Regiment at a key moment in its history, to educate the audience and to pay tribute to those who courageously and selflessly risked their lives on the battlefield, many of whom paid the ultimate price. </div></blockquote>

<p>My ancestor, James Wemyss, led his troop in the final charge of the Greys at Waterloo. Wounded in the arm and having taken musket fire and had two horses shot from beneath him, he wrote a letter from the battlefield to his sisters in Edinburgh, informing them of the victory and of the severe losses suffered by the Regiment. Of the initial 400 cavalry, he writes that only 26 remained on the field to the last. This may be close to the figure we manage to field on the day. Admittedly a lot less than the original 400, but at least it will be something. In fact, it will be more than something – it will be a major accomplishment! </p>
<p>The Greys not being represented at the bicentenary re-enactment is unimaginable. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Please help us to make it happen!""</p>

<b>WATERLOO - the 1970s film</b>. <p>The impressive film footage you are seeing is from the 1970s film, WATERLOO, staring Rod Steigert &amp; Christopher Plummer.  With the producers heirs' gracious permission and in association with THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS, we can give you an impression of what THE ROYAL SCOTS GREYS would have looked like. While greatly appreciated and entertaining to watch this charge, there are some inaccuracies and inconsistencies of The GREYS' charge as it was presented in the film, and this will give us the chance to educate at WATERLOO 2015 by sharing the the actual details of what really happened two hundred years ago. </p>
<p>The GREYS and the UNION BRIGADE actually charged, a massive column of thousands  of French infantry.  The French suffered hundreds if casualties and two-three thousand were captured as prisoners. This clash of cavalry and infantry would have proved far too costly for the movie production,  so it was dropped completely. During the charge many  of the GREYS probably wore weather covers on their bearskins. The GREYS continued the charge and successfully overran the French artillery. The GREYS also completed  four or five additional charges later that day which contributed to the attrition of both troopers and horses.  None of this was covered in the film nor is it ever mentioned in most historical books. </p>

<p><b>STRETCH GOALS -------</b></p>
<p>This campaign of GREYS &amp; GLORY is really Phase Two of the funding needed. </p>
<p>If we can reach these funds now, on this campaign, it will allow us to have two troops or more! </p>
<p>If we can obtain these stretch goals now, it will allow better efficiency of the funds, especially in procuring the horses on a group rate and with transportation along with deposits etc. </p>
<p><span>Most importantly, the more funds we raise, the higher the percentage that also goes to ABF The Soldiers' Charity &amp; Scotty's Little Soldiers.</span></p>

We need your help to
make it happen!

100 years before WW1, another pivotal event occurred in European history... Waterloo. Please help us to honour a famous Scottish Cavalry Regiment, whose courage and sacrifice were crucial to the outcome of the battle that shaped Europe for a century. Surplus funds will go to two charities, helping members of today's British Forces and their families. 
GREYS & GLORY    1815 - Waterloo - 2015The 18th June 2015 will mark the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. This was the decisive, bloody and muddy battle that brought an end to Napoleon’s campaign and saw no less than 45000 casualties in the first 12 hours of conflict. To commemorate the battle, a large re-enactment takes place on the original battlefield every 5 years. The bicentennial re-enactment in 2015 will be massive.  5000 participants, consisting of 4500 infantry, 300 cavalry and 100 canon, will perform to over 120,000 live spectators and millions of TV viewers worldwide.  
The ROYAL SCOTS GREYS made a series of momentous cavalry charges that fateful day in 1815, including the most famous charge as part of the Union Brigade, turning back 20,000 of Napoleon’s infantry.Despite their valiant and historic role in the battle, The Greys, who also captured one of Napoleon’s prized eagle-standards and suffered major casualties, have not, until now, been represented at these re-enactments. The absence of The Greys at the bicentennial commemoration is unimaginable.
In association with THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS (formerly THE ROYAL SCOTS GREYS) and the Regiment's Waterloo 200 committee, The War Horse Foundation is spearheading the project GREYS & GLORY. 

We are
Fritz Bronner, Director of the War Horse Foundation in Los Angeles, and Jonathan Findlay, former Captain of The Royal Scots
Dragoon Guards.

Our aim is to source enough riders, horses, period uniforms, logistical support and funds to guarantee the representation of The Royal Scots Greys on the original battlefield at the bicentennial commemorations and re-enactment at Waterloo in Belgium (17-21 June 2015).
While remembering the past, we wish to also recognise the present; after we have covered our logistical and administrative costs, surplus funds raised will go to our chosen charities: ABF The Soldiers' Charity and Scotty's Little Soldiers.
The Army Benevolent Fund (now The Soldiers' Charity) is a charity-trust that assists British veterans and their families. Scotty's Little Soldiers is a charity-trust focused on the children of military veterans who have fallen in their country's service.  These are  the equivalent of the Wounded Warriors and other like-minded VETERAN SUPPORT projects in America. This is a chance to help and say thank you for their service and sacrifice.

WHAT WE NEED
We hope to field up to 20 horses and riders on the day, but all their logistical and administrative costs need to be covered.
We hope to raise at least £150,000 (£5000 per horse and rider + taxes, charges and contingency) beyond which all surplus funds will benefit our chosen charities.
All donations, large or small, will bring us closer to achieving our goal and to helping our chosen charities.
There are also other ways in which you can help.
You can contribute more than money...
· Please get the word out, sound the trumpets and make some noise about our GREYS & GLORY campaign.
· Please use the Indiegogo share tools to share with your friends!
· If you have or know someone in the UK or Europe who has suitable, fit & trained, grey horses that can be loaned or lent to us, please let us know. 
· If you have some spare frequent flyer air-miles, these will help defray costs and assist in bringing the administrative team together for planning and coordination meetings and training sessions for the troops. 
· If you have British tack and saddles and can loan, lend or donate the gear to our campaign. 
· If you have ideas and suggestions, please contact us!
CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP
If you are part of a corporation and wish to help sponsor our campaign, we would be delighted to discuss our sponsorship solutions with you and will do our best to tailor the benefits to your budget and expectations. Please contact us via our website www.greysandglory.org. 
DONATIONS
Donations can be made via PayPal on this site. You don't however need a Paypal account.
Donations will be collected by The War Horse and Militaria Heritage Foundation and, after logistical and administrative costs have been covered, surplus funds will be paid to our chosen charities.  Donations by US citizens in the US are 100% tax- deductible to a 501-c3 non-profit that is fulfilling its educational mission.  The mission of the War Horse & Militaria Heritage Foundation (War Horse Foundation) is to educate the public of the contribution that horses have made in military history. 

For the past 15 years, War Horse Foundation has been presenting the GREYS in Parade Dress in California at festivals and cultural events, including four times in the Tournament of Roses Parade. 
Now, with THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS, we hope to  go to Waterloo and present the battle-campaign dress of the of the ROYAL SCOTS GREYS.  Some of our existing uniforms can be used, but others will need to be made from scratch, along with new gear and equipment and it all has to be shipped over to Belgium. PLEASE NOTE- we are not taking our horses over, due to expense and the stress this would cause to the horses.  We will therefore need to borrow or rent horses locally. 
With active and former officers of THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS and the support of the Regiment's Waterloo 200 Committee, we are all working together to build this project. 
Please take a moment or two to view the following series of videos we have prepared for this campaign. For those of you who wish to know more, additional information can also be found below or on our website www.greysandglory.org. THANK YOU FOR YOUR VALUABLE SUPPORT!
Warm regards,
Jonathan Findlay & Fritz Bronner

A FEW WORDS.... From the Commanding Officer of THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS
""It is an honour to introduce GREYS & GLORY which commemorates the bicentenary of the Battle of Waterloo, at which our regimental forebears fought.....The re-enactment of the battle on the 200th anniversary, offers us an opportunity to continue this legacy....This momentous event that will see the charge of the GREYS alongside some five thousand international re-enactors cannot occur without the hard work, sponsorship and support of many. 
I earnestly request your support to this important effort. the logistical challenge is considerable but one that must embraced with vigour and enthusiasm.
Proceeds that are raised beyond the costs....will go to the ABF: The Soldier's Charity, who help thousands of beneficiaries whenever they are in need including those serving and their families.""

October 2014 
I was commissioned into The Royal Scots Greys in 1965 on the 150th Anniversary of Waterloo -- now 50 years on, the importance of the Victory at the Battle of Waterloo is un-diminished. 
This coming year we commemorate the 200th Anniversary of The Battle of Waterloo. For our Regiment, now known as The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, Waterloo remains our main Battle Honour and The Eagle of the 45th French Infantry is still proudly worn as our cap badge. The treasured Eagle Standard captured by Sergeant Ewart is displayed in our Edinburgh Castle Museum, reminding us all of that famous Charge of the Union Brigade and sadly the 189 Regimental Soldiers who bravely gave their lives for King and Country. Their extraordinary courage continues to inspire the modern day Troopers who willingly risk their lives in the interests of World Peace, in the many challenging operational situations of today. 
My Waterloo 200 Committee fully supports The GREYS & GLORY initiative championed by the War Horse Foundation, to pay formal tribute to those who fell at Waterloo. ""
Brigadier Melville S. Jameson, Chairman Waterloo 200 Committee

""The Greys and Glory ride at Waterloo 200 should be a once in a lifetime opportunity to take recreate military history.  Profits from the ride will go towards charity.  ABF The Soldiers’ Charity (originally the Army Benevolent Fund, since creation in 1944) is the national charity of the British Army.  The charity looks after all soldiers, veterans (young and old) and their families when in need.  Our youngest beneficiary is a 5-month old child, the oldest a 107-year-old widow of a veteran.  Whether a soldier from World War Two, Korea, the Falklands, Northern Ireland, Iraq of Afghanistan (and many other campaigns besides), the Army’s charity provides the backbone of support typically to over 5000 individuals and families annually. No two families or situations are the same, but to those concerned the charity’s help can be little short of life-changing.  Poignantly, amongst these ranks are of course regimental descendants of Waterloo’s Scots Greys – today’s Royal Scots Dragoon Guards.
Thank you for your donation to Greys and Glory.  Any profits from the ride will go towards charity, which will allow us to help soldiers, veterans and families from World War Two to recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Good luck to all the riders taking part at Waterloo 200!”
Charles Dunphie, Regional Director Scotland, ABF The Soldiers' Charity

WHERE WILL THE FUNDS BE SPENT?
Your support of Greys & Glory will help and assist us in finding suitable grey horses to participate at the Waterloo commemorations, manufacture additional uniforms and bearskins caps of the era, gauntlets, equipment and accoutrements for horse and rider.  
Some items we have in stock and needs fluffing and repairs while many others will need to be manufactured.  
Relive the charge of the Greys! 
The horses will need to be transported from around Western Europe to Belgium, cared for, fed and trained as a unit. 
We have ambitious goals and with your help we hope we can present up to 30 Royal Scots Greys as they were in 1815 and participate in the five days at Waterloo 200.


What We Need & What You Get
We need these funds to secure suitable grey horses from the local region of Scotland, England, Wales, France, Germany, Belgium and or Holland, to train, drill, and transport to Waterloo, Belgium.  These horses will be privately owned, loaned or rented. They will need medical clearances by Veterinarians with proper certification clearances to cross borders in order to be at Waterloo 2015. All of the horses will need to be transported to Waterloo several days before the event, boarded and cared for. Horses need constant support personnel to be exercised, groomed and trained. This support involves grooms and extra hands to make sure the horses are always safe.
For You as a Donor!
By contributing to GREYS & GLORY, we have some amazing and unique PERKS with special access to functions at the higher levels. Please explore our PERK LIST below for more details.
Two hundred years ago, individuals founded and funded cavalry regiments. Cavalry regiments were historically pricier than infantry regiments, and they still are today. Officers back then, purchased their rank, and these funds helped pay for the regiment. We are hoping that you can help raise the 1815 ROYAL SCOTS GREYS this same way. By your level of donation, you are ""purchasing"" your honorary rank as part of the 1815 ROYAL SCOTS GREYS.  Your name will be listed in the DONOR RANK LIST under your level of donation. The list will be displayed in highest rank to lowest rank. 


We will
be operating a Prize Draw, into which the names of all donors, received both on and off line and
including those who wish to remain anonymous, will be entered, however the Terms and Conditions of Indiegogo do not
allow for the details to be hosted on this campaign page. Please therefore refer to our website www.greysandglory.org for details.                                                                                               -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Impact YOU will make with your contribution.
Your contribution will make this campaign possible and help build 1815 era ROYAL SCOTS GREYS into a mounted unit, similar to how they were when they made their famous charge at Waterloo.  
This is the first time in history (200 years!) to see the 1815 ROYAL SCOTS GREYS thundering again on the battlefield of Waterloo! You will make this iconic image part commemoration, memorial, part visual poetry and recognition of this British cavalry charge.
US donations is 100% tax- deductible to a 501-c3 non-profit that is fulfilling its educational mission.  The War Horse & Militaria Heritage Foundation (War Horse Foundation) mission is to educate the public of the contribution that horses made in military history. 

Your contribution and assistance will rebuild the grandeur of the ROYAL SCOTS GREYS as a mounted cavalry unit again! 
Let's make Britain and Scotland proud by remembering the GREYS, and their noble deeds!
Veterans of the GREYS and THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS will be present, honoured and thanked at a commemoration.
It will be the first time in 200 years that the GREYS have been at Waterloo! 
This is a once in a lifetime campaign! The 200th Anniversary only comes once! Here is a chance to show this to the WORLD!
Your support will allow us to bring this noble British cavalry regiment back to the fields of Waterloo in front of hundreds of thousands of spectators for the first time!
The combination of THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS, retired members of the regiment and the War Horse Foundation, brings an experienced team together.
Surplus funds, will go to two wonderful charity-trusts benefiting military veterans and their families, that are in need.                                                                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 


Risks & Challenges

How can we possibly rebuild a cavalry regiment from two hundred years ago?We have cavalry experience and many have military experience from their time in THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS along with discipline and training.  The War Horse Foundation has been presenting cavalry regiments and blending horses, riders and uniforms for 15 years. The Foundation has appeared in over 150 parades, as well as festivals, civic events and 25 schools.
All of the riders joining the GREYS & GLORY campaign, are experienced riders, however we plan to hold training days for the horses and riders to prepare for the event. 
War Horse trains every week as a mounted unit. Several of the former officers of THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS regularly ride and many have their own horses as well. Together, with our combined experience we should be able to quickly create a cohesive unit.
We will make our best efforts to achieve our goals, but if we do not have the full financial resources available, we will have to scale our scope of the  project. Other risks include weather, force-majeure or unforeseen obstacles or decisions made by the organisers of the event which could alter or curtail our plans. We also are working with horses that have natural inherent risks and potential unpredictable reactions to stimulus. All the donations are non refundable and will be spent on program costs with surplus amounts going to the designated charities.
This is a lifetime dream for many of us; to present and share the 1815 ROYAL SCOTS GREYS and commemorate the valour and sacrifice by this regiment at Waterloo. We are honoured to present the GREYS for the first time in 200 years at Waterloo and hopefully at events in the UK as well. 

How your donations will be applied.......The majority of the funds will go to finding quality grey horses, suitable for the ceremony, presentations and the battle reenactment at Waterloo. This includes rental of the horses, insurance, transportation, feed, box stalls, vet care, shoeing, grooms, health inspections, equine documentation, tack, equipment, shipping. We also need to cover the cost of tentage, food for the teams, travel, transportation of equipment , insurance and uniforms. We already have a dozen Scots Grey 1815 uniforms which we have been using for fifteen years. Some of these will need some refurbishing and we will need additional uniforms to ensure that all riders are kitted out. Additional bearskin caps, weather covers for bearskins, campaign breeches, accoutrements, extra bearskins, should straps and pouches. We also will have horse trailer transport trucks & drivers, ground crew and support team to take care of and their sustenance to cover.
All surplus funds, after administrative and logistical costs have been covered, will go 80% to ABF The Soldiers' Charity and 20%  Scotty's Little Soldiers.

Who is Riding?
Several retired officers from the regiment, enthusiasts and a group from the War Horse Foundation. We recruit experienced riders who need to handle a variety of situations with horses. We have men and women regularly train and  ride in the troop. All of the women that ride with us, hide their gender to appear as male troopers; just as the famous Mother Ross did with the Scots Greys one hundred years before Waterloo. THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS are very proud of the history and heritage of Mother Ross's exploits in battle as a SCOTS GREY and proudly recognise her in the regimental histories. The Regiment also recognises the value of diversity in the military today and the  Mother Ross's that may serve in the military today and in the future.

The riders are mostly based in the US & UK, but several are living throughout Europe as well. There is a shared knowledge overlap of the training and skills needed for this campaign.

What if you do not raise the full amount? 
Any amount of funding will help us in our goals in even a small way. We are determined to go to Waterloo, even with just a small footprint. There has never been a SCOTS GREY riding on the fields of Waterloo since the famous battle... Ideally we can make a proper presentation, worthy of the accomplishments of the ROYAL SCOTS GREYS.  We have already spent hundreds of hours planning this journey and are determined to give honour to the regiment. 
Once we have covered our logistical and administrative costs, any remaining funds left over will go to ABF The Soldiers' Charity & Scotty's Little Soldiers.

""The British have been our most valued friend and  ally, thru thick and thin... Here is a chance to recognise this by commemorating and celebrating the heritage of the GREYS for this auspicious ceremony and helping out British veterans and their families. All surplus funds will go to the ABF The Soldiers' Charity and Scotty's Little Soldiers.
This is a fantastic program for veterans and their families... Here is a chance for Americans to say thank you!
I can not tell you how much of a privilege and honour it is to be part of this endeavour. It is a once in a life time experience and we are hoping you will join and help us with any size of donation. Through your support we can take this journey together as we post images, videos and accounts of this fantastic series of commemorations of the ROYAL SCOTS GREYS.""-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A message from Jonathan



""I served in the Regiment over 20 years ago, as a Captain and Squadron Second-in-Command. And what an amazing Regiment in which to serve! Scotland's senior Regiment; Scotland's only cavalry Regiment; the Regiment's Colonel-in-Chief is none other than Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II; the Regiment boasts one of the most impressive lists of battle honours of all British Regiments; even the Pipes and Drums of The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards have achieved worldwide fame, winning numerous awards and holding the N°1 spot in the UK music charts for weeks on end! Everything about the Regiment breathes professionalism, courage, tradition and accomplishment. It truly is a Regiment which is Second to None.
However, you would have thought that, with so many accolades, the Regiment could afford to field its own troops at the Waterloo reenactment, but this is sadly not the case. The Regiment may have been one of the lucky few to have survived the recent volley of amalgamations and disbandments, but it has been equally hit by the cut-backs, both in terms of budget and autonomy. The World is getting smaller and the changing threat calls for changing roles and tactics. Already the Regiment is downsizing from Challenger II tanks to light armoured vehicles and there is no guarantee that The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards will remain untouched and intact should another round of defence cuts scythe through centuries of history and tradition. Ironically, the Regiment's conversion to lighter vehicles and its move back to Scotland both coincide with the bicentenary of Waterloo, the Regiment's most famous battle honour – another reason why the Regiment is counting upon us to represent The Greys at the Waterloo in 2015. And we are counting upon you to help us make it happen!Greys and Glory is much more than just a handful of riders dressing up and playing soldiers for a day or two. It is the opportunity to showcase the Regiment at a key moment in its history, to educate the audience and to pay tribute to those who courageously and selflessly risked their lives on the battlefield, many of whom paid the ultimate price. 


My ancestor, James Wemyss, led his troop in the final charge of the Greys at Waterloo. Wounded in the arm and having taken musket fire and had two horses shot from beneath him, he wrote a letter from the battlefield to his sisters in Edinburgh, informing them of the victory and of the severe losses suffered by the Regiment. Of the initial 400 cavalry, he writes that only 26 remained on the field to the last. This may be close to the figure we manage to field on the day. Admittedly a lot less than the original 400, but at least it will be something. In fact, it will be more than something – it will be a major accomplishment! 
The Greys not being represented at the bicentenary re-enactment is unimaginable. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Please help us to make it happen!""

WATERLOO - the 1970s film. The impressive film footage you are seeing is from the 1970s film, WATERLOO, staring Rod Steigert & Christopher Plummer.  With the producers heirs' gracious permission and in association with THE ROYAL SCOTS DRAGOON GUARDS, we can give you an impression of what THE ROYAL SCOTS GREYS would have looked like. While greatly appreciated and entertaining to watch this charge, there are some inaccuracies and inconsistencies of The GREYS' charge as it was presented in the film, and this will give us the chance to educate at WATERLOO 2015 by sharing the the actual details of what really happened two hundred years ago. 
The GREYS and the UNION BRIGADE actually charged, a massive column of thousands  of French infantry.  The French suffered hundreds if casualties and two-three thousand were captured as prisoners. This clash of cavalry and infantry would have proved far too costly for the movie production,  so it was dropped completely. During the charge many  of the GREYS probably wore weather covers on their bearskins. The GREYS continued the charge and successfully overran the French artillery. The GREYS also completed  four or five additional charges later that day which contributed to the attrition of both troopers and horses.  None of this was covered in the film nor is it ever mentioned in most historical books.

STRETCH GOALS -------
This campaign of GREYS & GLORY is really Phase Two of the funding needed. 
If we can reach these funds now, on this campaign, it will allow us to have two troops or more! 
If we can obtain these stretch goals now, it will allow better efficiency of the funds, especially in procuring the horses on a group rate and with transportation along with deposits etc. 
Most importantly, the more funds we raise, the higher the percentage that also goes to ABF The Soldiers' Charity & Scotty's Little Soldiers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bicentenary Re-enactment and Commemorations are in full preparation and the organisers have launched a number of trailers and teaser videos:

For over 36 years, Theatre of Yugen has bridged the gap between East and West; preserving the vanishing Japanese art-forms of Noh and Kyogen and making them accessible to Bay Area audiences.  Now, with a new leadership team in place, we're looking towards the future and planning the next 36 years of this vital organization.

We have the potential, and the people, to remain an integral part of the vibrant San Francisco arts community, but we can't do it without you.


Our Past

Theatre of Yugen was founded in 1978 by Yuriko Doi, as an ensemble company performing the traditional Japanese artforms of Noh and Kyogen (the only such company in the U.S. at the time). From there, Yugen grew to creating works of world theater influenced by traditional Japanese performing arts. We strive to project the aesthetic quality of yugen, or mysterious elegance, which gives our work a distinctive style.  Successful productions have included this lingering life, Mystical Abyss, Emmett Till, Sorya and Noh/Kyogen infused stagings of A Christmas Carol, Frankenstein, Antigone, and other classic Western works. Since 1979, Yugen has toured locally and internationally, bringing these rare and beautiful theatrical art forms to audiences including schools across the Bay Area, venues large and small throughout the United States and abroad.
In 1991, Yugen found a home in San Francisco's Mission District, our beloved NOHspace.  This space grew into a popular venue for both Yugen productions and collaborations with hundreds of local artists and small performing arts organizations.



Our Present
                  

 Theatre of Yugen has appointed a new Artistic Director, Tanroh Ishida, who brings extensive stage and film experience to the company, as well as a new artistic vision.

We've partnered with the San Francisco International Arts Festival to present The Genji State- an ambitious, immersive theatrical event which places audiences in the middle of a conflict between a totalitarian government and a rebel cause.  This cross-disciplinary collaboration will involve Miki Orihara (Prima Dancer for the Martha Graham company), internationally recognized music group JETSAM, and our local company members.
 
Mystical Abyss, our hit production from 2012, will tour to Denver, CO to be presented as part of an international arts symposium.  This will be the final performance for our founder, Yuriko Doi, before her well-earned retirement.



Our Future


 We have so many exciting plans for the future that our largest challenge is deciding which projects to pursue. Our immediate goals include:  Forging strong connections with local start-up companies, individual artists and small non-profits to transform NOHspace into a Community Arts Center; a creative ""hub"" focused on bringing unity to this diverse and rapidly changing neighborhood. Programs to include Artist/Company Residencies,  , pop-ups, and much more!
Reinventing the Theatre of Yugen Mainstage; focusing on creating large-scale, immersive, & experimental theatrical experiences such as the upcoming Genji State, and an interactive popup restaurant/performance focusing on Japanese food culture planned for 2016/2017.
Developing education programs focused on bringing theatre arts to the underserved youth of our community locally and across the wider Bay Area.

</div></div>","I donated a kidney!  Heroic you say?  More like fart-tastic... 

I'm Amanda Nicastro, actor, writer, all around funny gal.

I donated my kidney for my sister last summer!  This Spring I'm bringing my one-woman show about the best decision I ever made to the Orlando International Fringe Festival! 
I'm thrilled to be invited to perform - but the cost is on me and I'm going to need some help to make it happen.


  This time YOU'RE the donor!
 I know what it's like to make a major donation (boy do I ever...) Rest assured this money does good, is for good, and gets you something good, too!

The four thousand dollars goes solely towards production, advertising,  and traveling costs.  I'm putting in what I can but I'll still need help.
Friends from some major New York institutions are pitching in with gifts to reward your generosity.  From a night at the top comedy shows in Manhattan to an easy afternoon with Brooklyn Superheroes, you'll be in for some unique NYC treats for your generosity.

My story. Our cause.

There is a huge gap between the need for those waiting for life saving organs and the supply of those organs.   My hope is that this show starts a conversation that will dispel the myths surrounding organ donation, increase awareness and increase the numbers of registered organ donors. Our first run of the show at the New York Solocom Festival was a festival favorite.
I'll be remounting the show at the Peoples Improv Theater this Spring before heading to Orlando for the Fringe.  I'd love to see you there as I get ready for Florida!    Thank You.  The two most valuable things someone has are time and money.  I'm asking you to sacrifice both and I know that's a huge request.  I wouldn't ask if this show didn't mean the world to me.  And hopefully with your help, I'll change the world while making it laugh at the same time.

If you answered yes to any or all of those questions, this campaign is for YOU.  Become a Bench Believer today!  
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT 
Dayton Contemporary Dance Company (DCDC) officially joined this groundbreaking endeavor and will continue development of THE BENCH - JOURNEY INTO LOVE!  A five week workshop with the world-renowned DCDC dancers will begin August 1, 2016.  We are also thrilled to announce DCDC will produce the world premiere of THE BENCH - JOURNEY INTO LOVE in association with Titus Theatricals during the 2017-18 season.
Creator, Kiesha Lalama, was inspired and driven by the Confucius quote - ""To put the world in order, we must first put the nation in order; to put the nation in order, we must first put the family in order; to put the family in order, we must first cultivate our personal life; we must first set our hearts right.""  She worked endlessly to create a show that was meaningful and close to her own heart.  Kiesha evolved her original concept - from a small, surface based, family themed story to a deeply rooted, universal themed experience - with hopes to provide a familiar platform for uncomfortable conversations surrounding acceptance and universal love.  
After seven years of perseverance, and considering our current challenging times in society, now is the time for all of us to come together, allow for the beautiful message of this show to be delivered, and make this final journey a success.








What is THE BENCH - JOURNEY INTO LOVE?



THE BENCH - JOURNEY INTO LOVE is about a couple that
serendipitously meet on an ordinary day at a seemingly ordinary wooden park
bench. The couple falls in love, and we journey with them through marriage,
parenthood, sibling rivalry, family dinners, and growing old. The Bench creates a universal photo
album of memories that evoke tears and laughter. A live jazz fusion band
accompanies the dancers and singers with a contemporary score that incorporates
improvisational riffs throughout the inspiring and heartwarming story.

Point Park University – Pittsburgh, 2010 – Back by popular demand, Pittsburgh Playhouse (the producing
arm of PPU) stages THE BENCH for a second season with a sold-out run. This version of the production was
re-worked to incorporated a storyteller and was named Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s ""Best of Dance"" Top Ten list
again in 2010.

</div></div>","THEATRE N16... Theatre N16 was founded in May this year as a hub for the theatre makers of tomorrow to gather in Stoke Newington and produce new exciting work without any of the high overheads normally associated with theatre.
The opening season featured over one hundred actors, playwrights, directors and all round creatives. All of the in house shows were produced with all the artitsts receiving a fee and all companies paid no hire costs to the theatre itself, taking half of the box office receipts. 
Theatre N16 are sad to announce they are moving from N16 but ecstatic to be going for a full makeover as they move to SW12, to the Bedford pub in Balham.
This move is going to cost the company a few thousand pounds to get everything up and running again.
Theatre N16 receive no funding, no grants and no backing and have so far survived on small donations from friends and family, box office tickets and the (small) pocket of founder Jamie Eastlake.
To continue as a hub for the theatre makers of the future they desperately need the help of those who support the arts and support their vision.



   What We Need    New lighting equipment. During our opening season all of our lighting was rented, our aim is to buy everything for our reopening in September to keep long term costs down. Rent. We are delighted to be moving to the Bedford and need the funds to help us pay for such a glorious space.  Staffing. Running a theatre is tough and we need a small pot to start with to help build a wage structure for the future.     The Impact This money will help the new chapter of the Theatre to get off to the best possible start. We are here for the long haul and want to be the place to turn to in troubled times. A place to help playwrights, actors, directors, designers, technicians, literally all theatre people. Our new space will become a hub to give free space hire to companies and opportunities for all artists.

<p>[French translation at the end]</p><p>To
those who are reading this – my name is Vernice Miller, I am the artistic
director of <i>A Laboratory for Actor Training Experimental Theatre
Company</i> (ALAT) based in Brooklyn, NY. I’m reaching out to you because
I believe that now, more than ever, our communities can benefit immensely from
the power of theater and social change. </p>
<p>An international
group of artists under the direction of ALAT’s literary director, Seth
Baumrin, have joined forces to create an exciting new performance <span>steeped in ALAT's mission of creating dynamic theatre
that is socially relevant and theatrically engaging,</span>called <i>Port
d'Alger 1962 </i>– about how young people find joy even when surrounded by war.
</p>
<p>Over
the last decade Baumrin’s work took on a powerful dynamic as he developed a
methodology called Subpoetics that gave rise to <i>Port d'Alger 1962</i>.
Taking inspiration from his most recent exploration in Paris, we are now
working towards concretizing this international group to continue refining and
presenting <i>Port d’Alger 1962</i> in <b>Vienna this October --
26-30</b>. With a company that is comprised of artists from Africa, the
Balkans, India, Persia, Western Europe, and the United States, our aim is to use
the transcultural, multilingual composition of our group <b>to make
theatre a weapon to fight ethnic stereotypes resulting from xenophobia. </b>The
problem is, these international artists can’t pull this off on their own in a
timely manner.</p>
<p>This
is where your support is crucial.</p>
<p>Since
this is a multi-ethnic, multi-national group that sometimes goes off the map
(in Kosovo the work was done in secret; one member of the Paris team was
imprisoned in Tehran for doing experimental theatre), <i>our governmental
funding opportunities are limited</i>. Our 10 member team <b>is looking
for support from those who care about art and social justice, as well as
recognize the power theater has in creating social change</b>. Your support for
shared housing, transportation, and theatre rental costs in Vienna at 500 euros
for each member amounting to 5000 Euros (about 5500 USD),can help us fulfill our
dream tocreate collaborations that challenge stereotypes
that divide our communities, and instead provide a stimulating kaleidoscope of narratives
that draw us closer together.</p>
<p>I
hope you find this project worthy of support. Any sized contribution from $5 to
$500 will be immensely appreciated.</p>
<p>For
more info about the performance, read on:</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Port
d'Alger 1962</i>,
is a performance piece that was built on the principles of <i>Subpoetics, </i>which
is a methodology developed by Baumrin that relies on cubist concepts of
subjectless art going back to the early 20th century. Subpoetics create
images of beauty and the grotesque, stimulating audiences on a visceral level
regardless of culture or ethnicity. </p>

</div>","[French translation at the end]To
those who are reading this – my name is Vernice Miller, I am the artistic
director of A Laboratory for Actor Training Experimental Theatre
Company (ALAT) based in Brooklyn, NY. I’m reaching out to you because
I believe that now, more than ever, our communities can benefit immensely from
the power of theater and social change. 
An international
group of artists under the direction of ALAT’s literary director, Seth
Baumrin, have joined forces to create an exciting new performance steeped in ALAT's mission of creating dynamic theatre
that is socially relevant and theatrically engaging,called Port
d'Alger 1962 – about how young people find joy even when surrounded by war.

Over
the last decade Baumrin’s work took on a powerful dynamic as he developed a
methodology called Subpoetics that gave rise to Port d'Alger 1962.
Taking inspiration from his most recent exploration in Paris, we are now
working towards concretizing this international group to continue refining and
presenting Port d’Alger 1962 in Vienna this October --
26-30. With a company that is comprised of artists from Africa, the
Balkans, India, Persia, Western Europe, and the United States, our aim is to use
the transcultural, multilingual composition of our group to make
theatre a weapon to fight ethnic stereotypes resulting from xenophobia. The
problem is, these international artists can’t pull this off on their own in a
timely manner.
This
is where your support is crucial.
Since
this is a multi-ethnic, multi-national group that sometimes goes off the map
(in Kosovo the work was done in secret; one member of the Paris team was
imprisoned in Tehran for doing experimental theatre), our governmental
funding opportunities are limited. Our 10 member team is looking
for support from those who care about art and social justice, as well as
recognize the power theater has in creating social change. Your support for
shared housing, transportation, and theatre rental costs in Vienna at 500 euros
for each member amounting to 5000 Euros (about 5500 USD),can help us fulfill our
dream tocreate collaborations that challenge stereotypes
that divide our communities, and instead provide a stimulating kaleidoscope of narratives
that draw us closer together.
I
hope you find this project worthy of support. Any sized contribution from $5 to
$500 will be immensely appreciated.
For
more info about the performance, read on:

Port
d'Alger 1962,
is a performance piece that was built on the principles of Subpoetics, which
is a methodology developed by Baumrin that relies on cubist concepts of
subjectless art going back to the early 20th century. Subpoetics create
images of beauty and the grotesque, stimulating audiences on a visceral level
regardless of culture or ethnicity.

</ul></div>","OverviewHi. I'm Ralph Tufo, the playwright and composer for the musical, The Katrina Roadhouse. While working on several rebuilding projects after Hurricane Katrina, I heard the real-life stories of the survivors and the obstacles they had to face in rebuilding their lives and their communities.  I was extremely impressed with their resilience and determination.  I decided that these personal stories needed to be told. As a musician who's played Cajun and Zydeco music for the past 30 years, I thought what better way to relate these personal experiences and struggles than in a musical incorporating the culture of New Orleans and its road to recovery.The debut performances will commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and will  serve as a fundraiser for Common Ground Relief which for the past ten years has provided New Orleans residents with assistance in rebuilding, advocacy, and environmental improvements. Admission to the performances is free while contributions will be duly accepted for commongroundrelief.org.What We NeedContributions  will help to cover the necessary  production costs:

</p>
<p>In this documentary we chronicle the lives of  US street dancers as they train, live and compete in the world of street dance.<span> We go behind the scenes and take a look at the lives of these
high level street dancers to catch a glimpse of how they live, work, play, and how their life's journey have lead them from local heroes earning street cred, to international icons battling for respect, love of competition
and an undying passion for their style of dance.</span></p>
<p>These stories often go untold but like <i>Hoop Dreams </i>showed us the tough path of inner city basketball, and <i>Rise</i> brought us the story of Krump, <i>Champ</i> will show us what it takes to walk the path of the champion street dancers. </p>
<p>The producing team behind <i>Champ</i> are industry professionals who have developed relationships with the performers and have exclusive access to enter their lives in hopes of inspiring others as they were once inspired themselves. </p>
<p>This documentary will deliver a high quality behind the scenes look at the life of <b><i>Christopher 'Pharside' Jennings </i></b>the founder of the world champion <i>Academy of Villians; </i><b><i>Boogie Frantick</i></b> leader of the <i>Mighty Zulu Kings</i>; <i><b>Marie Poppins</b></i> a killer animator from France who now calls her US home, and the former World Champ <i><b>JSmooth</b></i> of <i>Machine Gone Funk</i>, who looks to repeat and bring the title back to the US as he did in 2006. </p>
<p>We look at the origins of popping as the dancers and OGs share their inspirations 
for moves, and hints of what is to come. Accessing some truly inspirational and influential people who have made a world of difference in the street dance and mainstream worlds.</p>

<br/></div>","THE PROJECT   Summerland is an original musical by Anika Johnson, Barbara
Johnston and Suzy Wilde, produced by Wexford Performing
Arts. The Breakfast Club meets Peter Pan meets the Lord of the Flies in this
ground-breaking show about 8 high school students who find themselves
stranded between worlds after a bus accident. Incredibly moving,
often hilarious and compelling from start to finish, Summerland explores and
celebrates what it is to be a teen today. FIVE REASONS THIS PROJECT IS EXCITING                      
1. Created by Canada's newest writing team Johnson, Johnston and Wilde
They have been featured on the Golden Globe-nominated series Orphan
Black, received accolades at the Edinburgh Fringe (2013 Fringe Review
Top 10), Toronto Fringe (2014 NOW Toronto Outstanding Production), and Summerworks. In addition they tour Canada in the Spice Girls Tribute band; Wannabe. Anika Johnson's song writing was recently featured in Theatre Sheridan's hit site specific musical, 'Brantwood'.  

2. Produced by Wexford Performing ArtsWexford Performing Arts has been producing high quality, full-scale theatrical productions for over 30 years and is home to the award winning Wexford Gleeks.  The Wexford Gleeks are a nationally recognized ensemble who were recently featured in two documentaries: The award winning TVO documentary 'Unsung - Behind the Glee' and 'The Real Glee' by Global television's 16:9. This past year 'The Gleeks' have performed at events for Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, James Earl Jones and Goldie Hawn and been heard on CBC's Sounds of the Season.  Graduates from the Wexford's Performing Arts program have gone on to star in film and television, Shaw, Stratford and on Broadway.

3. Toronto Arts Schools Unite
The cast of Summerland will unite students from Wexford Collegiate School for the Arts,
Etobicoke School of the Arts, The Randolph Academy's Pre-College Program and
Sheridan College.  

4. We're breaking the mold

The show will be performed on an epic scale rarely seen in Canada, with a huge cast of talented young artists, a live band, and innovative design.


You get to be part of the show! Our original production, taking place at Harbord
Collegiate begins with a site specific component in the school halls.  


5.  It's the perfect summer show!
Summerland is
the perfect show to see in the Annex on a summer’s night in July; it will fill
you with nostalgia, touch you with longing and awaken old dreams.
WHAT WE NEED:
Money!
Summerland will have a cast and crew of over 100.
Putting on a full-scale, professional level musical comes with a hefty price tag. Your contribution will help subsidize rehearsal space rental, sound and lighting, costumes, our set, props and everything else needed to bring Summerland to life. 
Every dollar counts! We appreciate any amount you're able to give. Look to the right for the fun gifts of gratitude you will receive
in return!

<i>Who We Are</i><br/>
</h4>
<p>Peasants of the Guild started in May of 2014 with 5 passionate students 
and the question ""what does morality look like in a modern lens"". These 
students have pursued this concept and are devising a show entitled
 ""Id-ol-Matic"". By incorporating their diverse interests and unique 
talents, these students have created a comedic and intriguing piece, 
intended for international audiences. They have been creating, 
rehearsing, and exploring for the past 8 months. Fast forward to 
February 2015 and they have been invited to perform in the Bienal Arte 
Joven Theater Festival in Buenos Aires Argentina, September of 2015! <br/></p>

</h3> <p></p>The Vienna Union Hall, built in 1888, still supports a large, one hole outhouse which is at least 80’ from the main door.  Currently, the hall used for arts and entertainment for the greater mid-Maine community, requires patrons in need of relief to  trudge out through mosquitoes, blackflies, wind, rain, hail, sleet or snow to the outhouse.. (which is the reason we must keep our shows short). Can we any longer go to the Union Hall for performances? It all <i>""Depends</i>"". If only we can upgrade and go green with a new composing toilet and handicap accessible building close to the entrance all will be well. <br/><br/>Our Union Hall was built in the small village of Vienna, Maine as a gathering place where townsfolk could unite. Historically the hall was built by the men of Vienna for the women of Vienna but is now a wonderful all community hall, complete with stage and balcony (and of course the outhouse). Labor for the building and upkeep of this historic hall has been done almost entirely by donations and the volunteering of local folks loving this old building. <br/><br/>Here people have met for dances and dinners; they have laughed and socialized in the hall on and off for over 127 years. The Hall has hosted Wild West shows, local theater, Professional Shakespearean theater, auctions, weddings and receptions, boy scout meetings, youth gatherings, Revels, dance performances and musicians from far and wide.  Over 1300 people come through the hall in a year. We may be one of the oldest continuously used theaters with no water and still using an outhouse.<br/><br/>Right now the old outhouse, built on top of ledge and listing to the side, is a cause for concern with the usual outhouse aroma and flying papers in wild wind storms. The seat of honor is hard to get to, having been built in a separate small building in the far back of the hall...with no electricity and no heat the trip is especially fierce in the coldest months. The path is rough and stony and once arriving, the building is not one where guests care to linger.  Our patrons are getting older, Maine having the oldest population in the nation, and does not meet the handicap accessible rules governing public buildings. Having coped with this outbuilding for the last 127 years we feel it is time to upgrade. <br/><br/>Help us move from brown and down to green and clean! Our vision for this great community building is a small, clean, well-lighted and warmed composting toilet building right off the handicap ramp on the side of the hall. <br/><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><b>What we have!</b><br/>We have already recruited skilled volunteer carpenters 
to build the new outbuilding and tear down and replace the ramp leading from the toilet house to
 the hall. For the building itself we need only materials. A site evaluator has volunteered to design the site and get permits and a 
volunteer to install the new composting toilet. The electric heat unit 
has been donated. <br/><b>What we need:</b><br/>We need some earthwork done with an excavator to prepare for the building.<br/>We also need a licensed electrician to install the lights and  and heat. All new public buildings must be handicap accessible!<br/>For the building we need to raise <br/>$10,221
 - building materials including footings, roofing, sheathing, handicap 
door and interior grab bar, electricity and earthwork <br/>$3,000 - ramp materials <br/>$3,079 - Envirolet® Waterless Remote System - We need a waterless system since we have no water in the building!<br/><b>Total amount we need to raise $16,300</b></p>
<p>Here is what the building will look like:</p>

We have opted for the flexible funding option so that if we are unable to meet our goal.. (can this really happen ??oh no...) we will put the funds received in a savings fund which we will continue to grow until we are able to move on with our toilet project.<br/>
<p>If, perchance,  we are able to raise more money than our estimated compost house expenses, the remainder of what we receive will go to support local professional artists, musicians and performers of all kinds by hiring them to perform at the fabulous Union Hall.</p>
<p>Check out our perks: your name immortalized in a new toilet house or in the hall or maybe a great CD from one of our shows or season tickets to the performances and a even a very cool T-Shirt. <br/></p>
</div> <div style=""""> <h3>The Impact - You can warm our buns.<br/>
</h3>
<p>Creating this new wonderful composting toilet has been the dream of people in our community for many years. Before every show at the hall people from far and wide take the time to make sure they don't drink too much, and use their home toilets before stepping out the door. Much of our audience is on the cusp of old age and walking in the dark over rough gravel with a full bladder can be very stressful. (We do hand out flashlights for the trip!)<br/></p>

<h3>It's Tax Deductible!</h3>
<p>The Vienna Union Hall Association is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization,  so all of your donations are tax deductible. <br/></p>
<h3><b>You make the world a more beautiful place. <br/></b></h3>
<p>Not only will our project help people feel better but it will also contribute to making <i>wonderful organic compost </i>for flowers around the hall<i> </i>(rather than creating the great  dilemma of what to do with  a full outhouse).  <br/></p>
<p>What do we do with  the resiDooDoo now? We can hire the ""cucka sucka"" to pump out the hole and truck it 
away.  We can honey dip and truck it to a disposal site on our own. We can bag it a haul it off to a disposal site.  We can hope it goes away by itself (not too likely). None of these options get the DooDoo where it will help beautify our world. But composting will!<br/></p>

<h3>Support a Participatory Community Culture</h3>
<p> Small town life still defies the extinction of community and a first hand connection to the arts.  The Union Hall connects people in a historic place without the use of electronics. Keep this connection alive and well in rural America!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Where will the old outhouse gogo?</h3>
<p>The old outhouse will not go to waste. No way would we let a pile of rubble be gone without finding a great use for it. We will clean up the icky waste underneath and close the hole. Then the Hall will have a wonderful storage shed for props and tools. Something we are sorely lacking at this time! <br/></p>
<h3>
Success Stories</h3>
<p> </p>
Throughout the years the Union Hall Association's momentum has passed from hand to hand but has always been focused on building, maintaining, renovating  and improving our hall. We have raised money from town suppers and auctions to <br/><p> insulate and sheetrock, (while preserving historic graffiti), refinished and painted the 
interior, had bench cushions made, repaired benches, installed new windows, upgraded from a wood stove to gas heaters and overcome the setback of a fire when the hall was struck by lightning the night before a fundraising auction was scheduled. Many more projects, too numerous to mention,  have been finished at the hall but the toilet has always been a problem too big for us to tackle alone. <br/></p>
<ul> </ul>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<h3>We Shall Overcome? But How?<br/>
</h3>In our small town, population of only 550+,  residents must, and do, take on multiple roles (as people used to do before specialization) to keep things running.  One of our carpenters is also the plumbing 
inspector, site evaluator and a performer on stage.  Our other carpenter is a boat builder and musician. Our parking coordinator is also a fireman that helped save the building after the lightning strike.  Helping save old walls of graffiti at the hall was led by the town archeologist who studied 
ancient red-paint people's drawings. We are diverse. We are determined. We are flexible, and we are able to meet challenges that would stop our potty project from coming to a successful conclusion. <br/> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Can't afford a donation at this time?

has been donated. What we need:We need some earthwork done with an excavator to prepare for the building.We also need a licensed electrician to install the lights and  and heat. All new public buildings must be handicap accessible!For the building we need to raise $10,221
 - building materials including footings, roofing, sheathing, handicap 
door and interior grab bar, electricity and earthwork $3,000 - ramp materials $3,079 - Envirolet® Waterless Remote System - We need a waterless system since we have no water in the building!Total amount we need to raise $16,300
Here is what the building will look like:

And here is our dream toilet! 
We have opted for the flexible funding option so that if we are unable to meet our goal.. (can this really happen ??oh no...) we will put the funds received in a savings fund which we will continue to grow until we are able to move on with our toilet project.
If, perchance,  we are able to raise more money than our estimated compost house expenses, the remainder of what we receive will go to support local professional artists, musicians and performers of all kinds by hiring them to perform at the fabulous Union Hall.
Check out our perks: your name immortalized in a new toilet house or in the hall or maybe a great CD from one of our shows or season tickets to the performances and a even a very cool T-Shirt. 
  The Impact - You can warm our buns.

Creating this new wonderful composting toilet has been the dream of people in our community for many years. Before every show at the hall people from far and wide take the time to make sure they don't drink too much, and use their home toilets before stepping out the door. Much of our audience is on the cusp of old age and walking in the dark over rough gravel with a full bladder can be very stressful. (We do hand out flashlights for the trip!)



Here's our existing one-holer...All fixed up and decorated to the nines, but it is hard to make a silk purse out of of sow's ear. And most of all hard to convey the cold breezes and odors blowing up from beneath that nice seat.  
Why Help???
It's Tax Deductible!
The Vienna Union Hall Association is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization,  so all of your donations are tax deductible. 
You make the world a more beautiful place. 
Not only will our project help people feel better but it will also contribute to making wonderful organic compost for flowers around the hall (rather than creating the great  dilemma of what to do with  a full outhouse).  
What do we do with  the resiDooDoo now? We can hire the ""cucka sucka"" to pump out the hole and truck it 
away.  We can honey dip and truck it to a disposal site on our own. We can bag it a haul it off to a disposal site.  We can hope it goes away by itself (not too likely). None of these options get the DooDoo where it will help beautify our world. But composting will!


Support a Participatory Community Culture
 Small town life still defies the extinction of community and a first hand connection to the arts.  The Union Hall connects people in a historic place without the use of electronics. Keep this connection alive and well in rural America!

Where will the old outhouse gogo?
The old outhouse will not go to waste. No way would we let a pile of rubble be gone without finding a great use for it. We will clean up the icky waste underneath and close the hole. Then the Hall will have a wonderful storage shed for props and tools. Something we are sorely lacking at this time! 

Success Stories
 
Throughout the years the Union Hall Association's momentum has passed from hand to hand but has always been focused on building, maintaining, renovating  and improving our hall. We have raised money from town suppers and auctions to  insulate and sheetrock, (while preserving historic graffiti), refinished and painted the 
interior, had bench cushions made, repaired benches, installed new windows, upgraded from a wood stove to gas heaters and overcome the setback of a fire when the hall was struck by lightning the night before a fundraising auction was scheduled. Many more projects, too numerous to mention,  have been finished at the hall but the toilet has always been a problem too big for us to tackle alone. 
 


We Shall Overcome? But How?
In our small town, population of only 550+,  residents must, and do, take on multiple roles (as people used to do before specialization) to keep things running.  One of our carpenters is also the plumbing 
inspector, site evaluator and a performer on stage.  Our other carpenter is a boat builder and musician. Our parking coordinator is also a fireman that helped save the building after the lightning strike.  Helping save old walls of graffiti at the hall was led by the town archeologist who studied 
ancient red-paint people's drawings. We are diverse. We are determined. We are flexible, and we are able to meet challenges that would stop our potty project from coming to a successful conclusion.     Other Ways You Can Help Can't afford a donation at this time? You can still help us by spreading the word to others.   Send a link to our campaign to all of  your email, facebook and twitter contacts and ask them to pass it on,,,
  And that's all there is to it.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hey everybody :) Beleza aka Nico Zen here and I wish to share with you today this exciting creative project I am launching here in Venice, Los Angeles, California. </p> <p>I have created an awesome healing modality whereby I combine the healing power of touch with the emotional vibration healing of the Bach flower essences. This modality heals clients on both a physical and emotional level, leaving the mind and body feeling rejuvenated, refreshed, and invigorated to live out one’s unique soul goals.</p>
<p> </p> <p>My funding goals are to garner enough start up capital to expand my existing client base, launch a new website, and hire out technology support for marketing, social media and mobile web app development. </p> <p>I know I can grow my business exponentially. Please will you help me today to make this heal and reveal dream a reality?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A little bit more…</p> <p>The Bach flower essences helped me to rediscover all the intuitive and creative power I have within me to create through the beautiful language of dance hence ballet. </p> <p>Sadness and depression are a heaviness that can wear many names and this fact is one reason why the Bach flower essences are so powerful and transforming. These powerful energetic healing tools allow you to deep dive into your healing, where each essence corresponds to a very specific emotional response.</p> <p>For instance:</p> <p>If you are feeling a complete sense of overwhelm, if you feel incapable at the enormity of a task because of a great inner anxiety in feeling you cannot do everything yourself and/or you are in a position at work where you have a tremendous amount of responsibility attached, like a president, cfo, or film director, then you can take the flower essence ELM to alleviate these symptoms and make you feel confident, responsible and organized.</p> <p>In cases of PTSD one can take the essence STAR OF BETHLEHEM and feel an immediate release from sadness and a greater capacity to open up. A third example I can give from my own healing work is using the essence SCLERANTHUS or ALÈNE as it is called in French. Being both a poet and a dancer, I sometimes found it hard to begin projects and make choices, always seeing obstacles down the road between one option and the other and unfortunately leaving me too long in the nether of indecision consequent. Through using the flower essence ALÈNE I became adroit at choosing between two options, making good choices and acting quickly, knowing what I want and having no regrets in the choices I make. </p> <p>I hope you can see from these examples how this course of healing is worlds better than going to a doctor and saying “I feel sad” in some sort of a grey haze where  neither you nor the doctor really have any idea what is going on. Flower essence therapy provides acute relief to emotional suffering. Feel better now. Transform through healing!</p>
<p>So In closing…</p> <p>If you have read down this far into the campaign, first:</p> <p>THANK YOU!</p>
<p>MERCI BIEN!!</p> <p>We live in a media saturated, attention deficit world and your genuine interest in my campaign means the world to me!</p> <p>I leave you with some resonant quotes from the seminal treatise “Heal Thyself” the book authored by Dr. Edward Bach laying out the vision and mission statement he originally envisioned when first developing this method of homeopathy in the early twentieth century. I hope they leave you as inspired and encouraged as they did me when I first discovered this brilliant and humble man’s work nearly a decade ago. </p> <p>Chapter 1, page 1</p> <p>“</p>
<p>… it is humbly hoped that it will be a guide to those who suffer, to seek within themselves the real origin of their maladies so that they may assist themselves in their own healing...the main reason for the failure of modern medical science is that it is dealing with results and not causes...Disease will never be cured or eradicated by present materialistic methods, for the simple reason that disease in its origin is not material. What we know as disease is an ultimate result produced in the body, the end product of deep and long-acting forces, and even if material treatment alone is apparently successful this is nothing more than a temporary relief unless the real cause has been removed.”</p> <p>Chapter 2, page 13</p> <p>“ Then follows a fourth great principle, that so long as our Souls and personalities are in harmony, all is joy and peace, happiness and health. It is when our personalities are lead astray from the path laid down by the Soul, either by our own worldly desires or by the persuasion of others, that a conflict arises. This conflict is the root cause of disease and unhappiness. No matter what our work in the world — bootblack or monarch, landlord or peasant, rich or poor— so long as we do that particular work according to the dictates of the Soul, all is well; and we can further rest in whatever station of life we are placed, princely or lowly, it contains the lessons and experiences necessary at the moment of our evolution, and gives us the best advantage for the development of ourselves.”</p> <p>Chapter 5, pages 27-28</p> <p>“True, it may be the calling of any one individual to devote his life to one other alone, but before doing so let him be absolutely certain that this is the command of her Soul, and that it is not the suggestion of some other dominant personality over-persuading her, or false ideas of duty directing him. Let she also remember that we come down into this world to win battles, to gain strength against those who would control us, and to advance to that stage when we pass through life doing our duty calmly and quietly, undeterred and uninfluenced by any living being, calmly guided always by the voice of our Higher Self. For many their greatest battle will be in their own home, where before gaining their liberty to win victories in the world they will have to free themselves from the adverse domination and control of some very near relative.</p> <p>Any individual, whether adult or child, part of whose work it is in this life to free herself from the dominant control of another, should remember the following: firstly, that his would-be oppressor should be regarded in the same way we look upon an opponent in sport, as a personality with whom we are playing the game of Life, without the least trace of bitterness, and that if it were not for such opponents we should be lacking in the opportunity to develop our own courage and individuality; secondly, that the real victories of life come through LOVE and gentleness, and that in such a contest no force whatever must be used: that by steadily growing in his own nature, bearing sympathy, kindness and, if possible, affection—or, even better love— towards the opponent, she may so develop that in time she may very gently and quietly follow the call of conscience without allowing the least interference.”</p> <p>This final quote harkens to my mind the profound speech, “The Great March to Freedom” given by the venerable, prolific and divine Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on June 23, 1963 in Detroit, Michigan. In this speech the husband of Coretta Scott talks of his naiëve dream of the white oppressor transforming the society of segregation, both seen and unseen, to one where racism no longer exists and exploitation is acknowledged and undone, to one where the oppressed can look with love towards a future where equality is a reality and can get up and stand up to a system of injustice without hatred eating at their insides, towards a complete societal transformation where love and tolerance are normal interactions. For injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere!</p>

Please will you help me today to make this heal and reveal dream a reality?
 
A little bit more… The Bach flower essences helped me to rediscover all the intuitive and creative power I have within me to create through the beautiful language of dance hence ballet.  Sadness and depression are a heaviness that can wear many names and this fact is one reason why the Bach flower essences are so powerful and transforming. These powerful energetic healing tools allow you to deep dive into your healing, where each essence corresponds to a very specific emotional response. For instance: If you are feeling a complete sense of overwhelm, if you feel incapable at the enormity of a task because of a great inner anxiety in feeling you cannot do everything yourself and/or you are in a position at work where you have a tremendous amount of responsibility attached, like a president, cfo, or film director, then you can take the flower essence ELM to alleviate these symptoms and make you feel confident, responsible and organized. In cases of PTSD one can take the essence STAR OF BETHLEHEM and feel an immediate release from sadness and a greater capacity to open up. A third example I can give from my own healing work is using the essence SCLERANTHUS or ALÈNE as it is called in French. Being both a poet and a dancer, I sometimes found it hard to begin projects and make choices, always seeing obstacles down the road between one option and the other and unfortunately leaving me too long in the nether of indecision consequent. Through using the flower essence ALÈNE I became adroit at choosing between two options, making good choices and acting quickly, knowing what I want and having no regrets in the choices I make.  I hope you can see from these examples how this course of healing is worlds better than going to a doctor and saying “I feel sad” in some sort of a grey haze where  neither you nor the doctor really have any idea what is going on. Flower essence therapy provides acute relief to emotional suffering. Feel better now. Transform through healing!
So In closing… If you have read down this far into the campaign, first: THANK YOU!
MERCI BIEN!! We live in a media saturated, attention deficit world and your genuine interest in my campaign means the world to me! I leave you with some resonant quotes from the seminal treatise “Heal Thyself” the book authored by Dr. Edward Bach laying out the vision and mission statement he originally envisioned when first developing this method of homeopathy in the early twentieth century. I hope they leave you as inspired and encouraged as they did me when I first discovered this brilliant and humble man’s work nearly a decade ago.  Chapter 1, page 1 “
… it is humbly hoped that it will be a guide to those who suffer, to seek within themselves the real origin of their maladies so that they may assist themselves in their own healing...the main reason for the failure of modern medical science is that it is dealing with results and not causes...Disease will never be cured or eradicated by present materialistic methods, for the simple reason that disease in its origin is not material. What we know as disease is an ultimate result produced in the body, the end product of deep and long-acting forces, and even if material treatment alone is apparently successful this is nothing more than a temporary relief unless the real cause has been removed.” Chapter 2, page 13 “ Then follows a fourth great principle, that so long as our Souls and personalities are in harmony, all is joy and peace, happiness and health. It is when our personalities are lead astray from the path laid down by the Soul, either by our own worldly desires or by the persuasion of others, that a conflict arises. This conflict is the root cause of disease and unhappiness. No matter what our work in the world — bootblack or monarch, landlord or peasant, rich or poor— so long as we do that particular work according to the dictates of the Soul, all is well; and we can further rest in whatever station of life we are placed, princely or lowly, it contains the lessons and experiences necessary at the moment of our evolution, and gives us the best advantage for the development of ourselves.” Chapter 5, pages 27-28 “True, it may be the calling of any one individual to devote his life to one other alone, but before doing so let him be absolutely certain that this is the command of her Soul, and that it is not the suggestion of some other dominant personality over-persuading her, or false ideas of duty directing him. Let she also remember that we come down into this world to win battles, to gain strength against those who would control us, and to advance to that stage when we pass through life doing our duty calmly and quietly, undeterred and uninfluenced by any living being, calmly guided always by the voice of our Higher Self. For many their greatest battle will be in their own home, where before gaining their liberty to win victories in the world they will have to free themselves from the adverse domination and control of some very near relative. Any individual, whether adult or child, part of whose work it is in this life to free herself from the dominant control of another, should remember the following: firstly, that his would-be oppressor should be regarded in the same way we look upon an opponent in sport, as a personality with whom we are playing the game of Life, without the least trace of bitterness, and that if it were not for such opponents we should be lacking in the opportunity to develop our own courage and individuality; secondly, that the real victories of life come through LOVE and gentleness, and that in such a contest no force whatever must be used: that by steadily growing in his own nature, bearing sympathy, kindness and, if possible, affection—or, even better love— towards the opponent, she may so develop that in time she may very gently and quietly follow the call of conscience without allowing the least interference.” This final quote harkens to my mind the profound speech, “The Great March to Freedom” given by the venerable, prolific and divine Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on June 23, 1963 in Detroit, Michigan. In this speech the husband of Coretta Scott talks of his naiëve dream of the white oppressor transforming the society of segregation, both seen and unseen, to one where racism no longer exists and exploitation is acknowledged and undone, to one where the oppressed can look with love towards a future where equality is a reality and can get up and stand up to a system of injustice without hatred eating at their insides, towards a complete societal transformation where love and tolerance are normal interactions. For injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere!

His latest creation, W.A.R. (We Anit Right) follows suit by tackling issues within the African American community and Mental Health. W.A.R. is the beginning of a movement in finding our truth, battling our inner struggles, and winning the war for self-love. Click here to learn more about Hendricks. ABOUT W.A.R In a world where our internal wars inevitably trigger external conflict, this revolutionary production takes you on a journey that explores and asks questions about the terrain of our humanity. Through music representing the heartbeat of the dirty south, movement with a funky militaristic cadence, breathtaking multi-media, and riveting storytelling culminating in a life-changing feel-good experience. Set on an urban street where we all must rise because the court is in session. The judge sets the stage as the defense team begins to present the case of why WE AIN’T RIGHT. The prosecution team argues if it ain’t broke then why fix it. As the two sides battle, a gritty ensemble takes the stand as the sound of war echoes through the street. In this battle for the love of self where the people speak, the audience is the jury and love is the winner.RALLYING THE TROOPSIf you are going to win a W.A.R, then you need a mighty army of supporters who are willing to get in the trenches with you. We are rallying the troops to get involved with this production by becoming a sponsor, investor, or by contributing.

Our goal is to provide workshops with actors and the general public that address the themes from the production.POSSIBLE SNAFUWith every battle, there will be some challenges.

<h3>Hey there!</h3>
<p>Maggie and Annaliese here. We're back! Did you miss us? We sure missed you! After a successful crowdfunding campaign this past spring, and a full run of Shakespeare's The Tempest, we are back seeking support for our next adventure! Coming up in February 2020 - Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, and we are just $7,000 shy of our goal to fully fund this exciting piece!</p>
<p>What is Measure for Measure and why is it relevant?! </p>
<p>Known as one of Shakespeare's problem plays, we will immerse the audience in this unfinished conversation on justice, corruption, morality, and mercy.</p>
<p>The Duke of Vienna vanishes abruptly leaving Lord Angelo as his successor. In his stead, Angelo enacts his own sense of justice causing mass chaos throughout the city. The only person who can stop him now is a nun-in-training, named Isabella. A story of power, those who abuse it, and those who suffer at their hands. Does this sound familiar?</p>
<p>This piece, directed by the vibrant Michael Fleischer and with an entirely female production team, will not shy away from male toxicity. We intend to lean into what makes this piece a problem play. Exploring a broken justice system built by men, how and when people can use their voice, and a battle of wills between two people who claim to be guided by faith in a Vienna dominated by egos, idols and debauchery.</p>
<p>The magnitude of this story and the sobering reality of the ending can only be brought to reality with your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Let's break it down folx! $7,000.00 will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 hours of rehearsal space</li>
<li>All construction materials and labor needed for the set and the costumes</li>
<li>Paying every single artist involved: the actors, the design team, and the production team</li>
<li>Insurance, printing costs, marketing and manpower</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>The satisfaction of helping young artists create meaningful work to impact modern audiences....</p>
<p>ALSO SWAG! See what rewards come with the different giving levels to the right of this campaign!</p>
<p>... But like, a dope immersive theatrical experience that will make you think and leave you wanting and give you something to do in the dead of winter.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>On a more serious note, this particular piece is very personal and meant to create space and conversation around the toxicity that is coming to light in the world at large and specifically in entertainment. This campaign and your involvement can and will make this possible. </p>
<p>This is an opportunity to speak up in the #metoo movement and present a difficult conversation that does not yet have a resolution.</p>
<p>This will be our 5th fully mounted theatrical production with a limited run. 3 years in, as a little but fierce company, we exist entirely due to continued financial support - we would be unable to do any of this without you! We are humbled and grateful and ask for your support yet again as we forge ahead.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The reality is that space rental costs in NYC continue to be the largest hurdle for our small company when it comes to our productions. While we are working towards being a self-sustaining company, we haven't grown to that place YET! We have big dreams (including our desire and plans to partner with prison outreach Shakespeare initiatives, provide ongoing workshops for adults and children, and build accessibility in the communities around us) and these dreams require big funds. We operate on an extremely low budget in the theater community keeping our productions under $12,000.00. Every donation makes a difference! We've had amazing responses to our productions and community events, we continue to foster the collaborative nature of our company, and with each year we are growing in our abilities and expertise in this field. We are incubator members of the Alliance of Resident Theatres (A.R.T./New York), we are fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas, and we are a proud contributor to the Indie Theater Fund. </p>
<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We understand that some people just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help! Here are some additional ways to show your support:</p>
<p>Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign! Share, post, re-post, and use those social media platforms to reach those people you know, and those you really don't know.</p>
<p>Any amount you can donate, be it $5, $50, $500, is an immense help to us and our forward momentum. </p>

<p>ARISTOS: THE MUSICAL sings the story of doomed heroes Achilles and Patroclus through a heartbreaking pop/soft rock score. An Iliad adaptation written by young Stanford alumni Muse Lee and Aaron Reed, Aristos enjoys a devoted global fanbase that has carried the fast-rising new musical from reading to production to album.</p>
<p>Though COVID-19 halted our Bay Area premiere, Aristos sings on. Our album, slated for a winter release, involves nearly fifty cast and creative team members from around the world. A diverse group that ranges from ages 13 to 70 and hails from seven different countries, the artists rehearse online and record safely from their own homes. </p>
<p>ARISTOS will be holding a four-week fundraiser in order to recoup our production costs. Not only will this cover the labor and expertise of our team (performers and producers alike) as well as the hardware required for recording, but this will also help us to distribute our album across as many platforms as possible - including Spotify, Apple Music, and more.</p>
<p>This fundraiser would also go towards the production of affordable merch such as stickers, t-shirts, and more!</p>
<p>We have a goal of $3,000. It sounds like a lot, we know. (Believe us, we know.) But ARISTOS has and always will be a project based in community. Our community launched us over a year ago when this musical was a casual staged reading born from a single song, and our community has carried us all the way to our international cast album with professionals around the world. And we know our community can carry us just a little further - home to Ithaca.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support, and we can't wait to sail to Ithaca and share our album with you!</p>

<p>Changing Face Collective presents<i> Love on the Dole</i> by <i>Ronald Gow &amp; Walter Greenwood</i>; a play that captures the painful reality of the 1920s governmental welfare cuts to the working class and the rise of socialism. It follows the story of Sally Hardcastle – the modern woman -who becomes her family’s sole breadwinner. In love with political activist Larry Meath, she dreams of escape from the murky streets of Salford.</p>
<p>Although first performed over 85 years ago, Love on the Dole draws many parallels to our political and social climate now, reminding us that history is in a constant state of repetition. This government’s austerity driven ideology – a bitter symptom leftover from the 2008 financial crisis – is reminiscent of the savage cuts of the 1929 Great Depression.</p>
<p>Directed by Lucy Curtis, the play is a collaborative production by Changing Face Collective. The Brixton-based collective specialises in documentary theatre, international new-writing and rediscoveries. <i>Love on the Dole</i> will follow on from the company’s sell-out run of Where Will We Live? at the Southwark Playhouse.</p>

New York City. Still struggling to find a theatre home, they decided to build
it for themselves. Since then, Lone Star has built an active community of
theater artists and audiences--people from Texas, people who love people from
Texas, and people who wish they were from Texas. </span></p>
<p>Lone Star has
developed the work over 25 playwrights through its Texas Reads Series, presented
the work of 4 composers in the annual Concert Series, and fostered dozens of
new artistic collaborations through our community events. </p>
<p><b>THIS SEASON<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>This year marks the
beginning of Lone Star's Artist in Residence Program. Our inaugural Robert
Askins Playwriting Fellows are Alan Charnock, Nilsa Reyna, Judith Leora, Emily
Comisar, Benjamin Wright, and David Davila. <p></p>
<p>Here's our line-up:</p>
<p><i>Alien Sex Comedy</i> by
Alan Charnock (November 19th)<br/>
<i>David Davila and the Magic Time Machine</i> by David Davila (January
25th)<br/>
<i>Switzerland</i> by Emily Comisar (February 22nd)<br/>
<i>Showpony</i> by Judith Leora (March 21st)<br/>
4th Annual Texas Reads Short Play Festival (April 18th)</p>
<p><b>COMMUNITY FIRST</b></p>
<p>From the beginning,
Lone Star was never <i>just</i> about the art. We firmly believe that
creating space for artists and audiences to build personal relationships with
one another improves the <i>entire</i> theater experience. That's why
the first Monday of every month, we host Lone Star Happy Hours. Everything we
do, we do with a little bit of flair and a whole lot of Texas hospitality.</p>
<p><b>THE BUDGET</b></p>
<p>The $3000 raised here
will cover our programming budget for the season.  There are four readings
scheduled (a total cost of $1,500) and one concert (another $1,500). We will be
engaging in other fundraising activities through-out the season to cover
administrative and overhead costs.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455314099/qzvqwith9s4lrguuuhfx.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 550px; height: 550px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455314125/scqupvovrdb2menrfpix.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 549.038px; height: 375px;""/></p><p>

Texas, and people who wish they were from Texas. 
Lone Star has
developed the work over 25 playwrights through its Texas Reads Series, presented
the work of 4 composers in the annual Concert Series, and fostered dozens of
new artistic collaborations through our community events. 
THIS SEASONThis year marks the
beginning of Lone Star's Artist in Residence Program. Our inaugural Robert
Askins Playwriting Fellows are Alan Charnock, Nilsa Reyna, Judith Leora, Emily
Comisar, Benjamin Wright, and David Davila. 
Here's our line-up:
Alien Sex Comedy by
Alan Charnock (November 19th)
David Davila and the Magic Time Machine by David Davila (January
25th)
Switzerland by Emily Comisar (February 22nd)
Showpony by Judith Leora (March 21st)
4th Annual Texas Reads Short Play Festival (April 18th)
COMMUNITY FIRST
From the beginning,
Lone Star was never just about the art. We firmly believe that
creating space for artists and audiences to build personal relationships with
one another improves the entire theater experience. That's why
the first Monday of every month, we host Lone Star Happy Hours. Everything we
do, we do with a little bit of flair and a whole lot of Texas hospitality.
THE BUDGET
The $3000 raised here
will cover our programming budget for the season.  There are four readings
scheduled (a total cost of $1,500) and one concert (another $1,500). We will be
engaging in other fundraising activities through-out the season to cover
administrative and overhead costs.

<p>While very exciting and immesurably worthwhile, our trip to Scotland comes with large financial hurdles.  </p>
<p>Overall, our goal is to raise $40,000. That includes $25,000 from our Indiegogo campaign and an additional $15,000 from our Los Angeles Fundraising events:</p> <div><ul>
<li>June 10th: I MADE YOU A SEX TAPE - Drama 3/4's ongoing music variety series, ""I Made You A Mix Tape,"" got a sexy makeover on June 10th at the legendary Hotel Cafe. The night featured a fantastic lineup of musicians and comedians and was a house-rocking success!</li>
<li>July 14th: CARNAL DESIRE LA - our last local show before we board the plane to Edinburgh included an after party with silent auction, adult beverages, surprise guests, giveaways and more! We had a sold-out crowd, and everyone left the theater clutching their sides and clamoring for more!</li>
</ul></div>
<div>Where is this all going? Well, we're glad you asked. Our actors are generously donating their time and the show is designed to minimize production costs (no set, one crew member, rights to the scripts generously donated by Philip S. Wilson himself). Still, our trip across the pond includes several expenses that we can't cover without your support:</div>
<ul> <li>Being a part of the Fringe! $6800 : We have booked one of the Fringe Festival's hottest comedy venues - the Pleasance Theatre - for 27 performances between August 3rd and August 29th. This fee includes Fringe management, theatre deposit, rental, Fringe programs, and fees. We will also be splitting our ticket sales with the venue to cover the remaining rental so if we can help to offset this cost we can donate a higher percentage of our ticket sales to the causes listed below.</li>
<li>Lodging - $14,000:  This is our biggest cost. CARNAL DESIRE requires a cast of at least 7 actors, although ideally we would love to bring 10-14 cast members to make this production truly come to life. We will be renting a 5-6 bedroom house (or equivalent combination of flats) to squeeze our cast, crew and production team into for the run of the show. These prices run steep as space is at a premium during the festival.</li>
<li>Marketing - $4200: Built into the Edinburgh package is Edinburgh publicity! We know our friends in LA love us, but we're new to the Scotland scene so it's important to get the word out. </li>
</ul>
<div>If we exceed our fundraising goal, additional funds will go towards:</div>
<ul>
<li>Helping with flights: Plane tickets from Los Angeles to Edinburgh average at about $1,200 - $1,400 each. We would love to help our core cast and production team with that cost.</li>
<li>Merchandise and advertising: Helps get the word out and increase our ticket sales!</li> <li>Food: Actors need to be fed.</li>
<li>Travel expenses: internet hotspot, international cellphones, laundry services, ground transportation, baggage fees, Scotland's finest cocaine, etc. </li>

<p>Everyday many
students had been practicing their passion, DANCE, in the rented hall of NDA;
however, the tragic earthquake in the country didn’t allow pursuing it. The
house where NDA rented the flat for dance has been claimed to be at risk and
because of this NDA has to move its practice hall somewhere else. As we don’t
have any property or land, the practice has been completely disrupted. We are
trying to collect fund and rebuild our academy to create more talented kids and
also to encourage the lovers of dance to pursue their passion.</p>
<p>Nepa Dance Academy, NDA has been
tremendously working hard since last five years to uplift dancing culture in
the country by teaching varied forms of dance form from classic to modern, from
ethnic form to international styles. About 40% of the students here are
learning with scholarship and from remaining students only $6 per month is
taken from each for regular training.</p>
<p>NDA has always been encouraging

Everyday many
students had been practicing their passion, DANCE, in the rented hall of NDA;
however, the tragic earthquake in the country didn’t allow pursuing it. The
house where NDA rented the flat for dance has been claimed to be at risk and
because of this NDA has to move its practice hall somewhere else. As we don’t
have any property or land, the practice has been completely disrupted. We are
trying to collect fund and rebuild our academy to create more talented kids and
also to encourage the lovers of dance to pursue their passion.
Nepa Dance Academy, NDA has been
tremendously working hard since last five years to uplift dancing culture in
the country by teaching varied forms of dance form from classic to modern, from
ethnic form to international styles. About 40% of the students here are
learning with scholarship and from remaining students only $6 per month is
taken from each for regular training.

Why ""Barefoot in the Park""?  

Neil Simon's ""Barefoot in the Park"" takes a comical look at the lives of newlywed couple, Paul and Corie.  He's a serious lawyer and she's a free-spirited woman ready for fun.  After a six day honeymoon, they find themselves grappling with the realities of married life in a small, fifth story New York apartment.  While hilarious, this story relates to anyone who is married and in relationships.  It confronts us with that moment when we realize what we expected from the other person is not always what we get.  Once we discover this, we are faced with the question ""Where do I go from here?"" and that is exactly what this play sheds light on.  It is also the reason we want to bring this show to Los Angeles audiences.

This is a Flexible Fundraiser. Any funds given will go right towards the production, regardless of reaching our goal or not. 

The Impact!

If we reach our goal (or beyond), it will be BECAUSE OF YOU and this is the difference you will make:  Up to 1,200 people will be given the gift of laughter through high quality entertainment, which explores relevant issues and timeless themes
It would be a stepping stone for us to build a non-profit theatre company that is able to give back to the community, support fellow artists, and allow us to continue pursuing our passion.

It would be a dream come true for Lee and Jordan and the tears of joy would start flowing!

<p><i>Tejiendo
comunidades entre fronteras a través del arte del movimiento.</i></p>
<p>Please look below for translation in Spanish. <i>Para la versión en español dirígete hacia abajo.</i></p>One year ago, a small group of dance artists from México and the US sat together and imagined the possibility of continuing our work together, of meeting 3 times a year to make new work, to share with our communities, to teach and perform and to make dance films that give us and our audience a broader view of our art form.  <br/><br/><p>Individually, we are each active artists in our own communities.  Together, we are a collective committed to collaboration, holding ourselves and each other to our highest standard.  We all bring a unique voice and spirit to this collective and this is what strengthens our work.  <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We believe that
through our work as artists and collaborators, we are sharing and demonstrating
a way of being and working together for common goals. These goals are to
encourage creativity, empathy, compassion, generosity and trust. As we work
collectively, each of us shares our own<b><i> </i></b>perspective and approach to art
making. By collaborating, each artist supports and is supported while expanding
and stretching into new territory. </p>

In October 2014, we raised just enough money to cover our expenses in order to hold our first CBC residency in Boulder, CO.  Since then, our work has continued and we have gathered a 2nd time in Boulder for dance making and performing, building our new website, creating a schedule and budget for the next 12 months and embarking on this, our first annual fundraiser!  </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><i>Hace un año, un
pequeño grupo de artistas de la danza y el movimiento de México y Estados
Unidos, nos reunimos para imaginar la posibilidad de continuar nuestro trabajo
juntas, reuniéndonos tres veces al año para crear un nuevo proyecto que
pudiéramos compartir con nuestras comunidades a través de la docencia,  la presentación de nuestro trabajo escénico y
la creación de video danzas que nos permitan, así como a nuestros públicos
expander las perspectivas de nuestra disciplina.</i></p>
<p><i>Individualmente, somos artistas activas en nuestras respectivas
comunidades. Juntas somos un colectivo comprometido con la colaboración,  nos apoyamos mutuamente hacia nuestros
mayores estándares.</i></p>
<p><i>Creemos que a través de nuestro trabajo como artistas y
colaboradoras, estamos compartiendo y demostrando una manera de trabajar juntas
para alcanzar metas comunes. Estas metas son incentivar la creatividad, la
empatía, la compasión, la generosidad y la confianza. En nuestro trabajo
colectivo, cada una comparte una perspectiva única y un acercamiento particular
al proceso creativo  y artístico.</i></p>
<p><i>En octubre del
2014, logramos reunir el suficiente dinero para cubrir nuestros gastos y
consolidar nuestra primera residencia en Boulder, Colorado (EUA). Desde
entonces nuestro trabajo ha continuado y nos hemos reunido por segunda ocasión
en Boulder para la creación y presentación de una obra de danza, para construir
nuestra página web y para desarrollar la calendarización y presupuesto de
nuestros siguientes 12 meses de trabajo; y embarcadas en esto: nuestra primera

October 2015<br/>3 weeks in Washington, Oregon and California to make, film and perform Zap McConnell's new project, Secondary Succession.  Secondary Succession will use the ruins of coastal military forts as visual landscapes for a new dance for film. Once created to protect the borders during WWI and WWII, now encroached on by the natural world and often repurposed as state parks and artist centers, these architecturally intriguing structures are already telling many stories.  We will listen, then tell our own.</div>
<div>WEEK 1: We will begin by exploring movement, installation and site specific response to the influences of: military history, moss, Japanese internment camps, Northwest Native American tribes, reservations, parachutes and hot air balloons, Fukushima, the jet stream, pirates and redwoods.Then we will film.</div>
<div>WEEK 2: We will work on building a garden at a permaculture based sustainable community in exchange for space, as we create a live performance based on our film creation. Then we will perform the show there and in Portland, OR.</div>
<div>WEEK 3: Some of us will remain on the West Coast and crush the editing of the film; taking advantage of our time together. When the 3 weeks is up, the project is completed! Then we share it; at planned showings in each of our communities and applying to Dance for Film Festivals. </div>

multidisciplinary contemporary dance work that will underline and unveil
 social and environmental justice issues through the participants’ 
kinesthetic senses and as a collective response from our individual 
perspectives.  In Cholula, we will create, perform and offer workshops in the community. <br/><br/>Charlottesville Residency, USA.

como paisajes visuales para un nuevo film de danza para la cámara. Creado
originalmente para proteger las fronteras durante la Primera y Segunda Guerras
Mundiales, este espacio se encuentra actualmente tomado por el mundo natural.
Frecuentemente estos espacios son retomados y reactivados por el estado para
convertirse en parques  o centros
artísticos. Estas intrigantes esculturas arquitectónicas, tal y como se
encuentran, ya tienen tantas historias que contarnos. Nosotras escucharemos
para después relatar la propia. </i></p>
<p><i>SEMANA 1:
Comenzaremos explorando movimiento, instalación y trabajo in-situ,  respondiendo a las
influencias de la historia militar, el musgo, los campamentos de reclusión
japonesa, las tribus nativas de Norteamérica, las reservas, paracaídas y globos
aerostáticos, Fukushima, el jet stream,
los piratas y los bosques de los gigantes sequoyas. Después filmaremos.</i></p>
<p><i>SEMANA 2:
Trabajaríamos construyendo un jardín de permacultura en una comunidad
sustentable a cambio de espacio, mientras creamos una presentación en vivo
basada en la creación audiovisual. Luego presentaremos en este lugar y en

Tejiendo
comunidades entre fronteras a través del arte del movimiento.
Please look below for translation in Spanish. Para la versión en español dirígete hacia abajo.One year ago, a small group of dance artists from México and the US sat together and imagined the possibility of continuing our work together, of meeting 3 times a year to make new work, to share with our communities, to teach and perform and to make dance films that give us and our audience a broader view of our art form.  Individually, we are each active artists in our own communities.  Together, we are a collective committed to collaboration, holding ourselves and each other to our highest standard.  We all bring a unique voice and spirit to this collective and this is what strengthens our work.  


We believe that
through our work as artists and collaborators, we are sharing and demonstrating
a way of being and working together for common goals. These goals are to
encourage creativity, empathy, compassion, generosity and trust. As we work
collectively, each of us shares our own perspective and approach to art
making. By collaborating, each artist supports and is supported while expanding
and stretching into new territory. 

In October 2014, we raised just enough money to cover our expenses in order to hold our first CBC residency in Boulder, CO.  Since then, our work has continued and we have gathered a 2nd time in Boulder for dance making and performing, building our new website, creating a schedule and budget for the next 12 months and embarking on this, our first annual fundraiser!  
Hace un año, un
pequeño grupo de artistas de la danza y el movimiento de México y Estados
Unidos, nos reunimos para imaginar la posibilidad de continuar nuestro trabajo
juntas, reuniéndonos tres veces al año para crear un nuevo proyecto que
pudiéramos compartir con nuestras comunidades a través de la docencia,  la presentación de nuestro trabajo escénico y
la creación de video danzas que nos permitan, así como a nuestros públicos
expander las perspectivas de nuestra disciplina.
Individualmente, somos artistas activas en nuestras respectivas
comunidades. Juntas somos un colectivo comprometido con la colaboración,  nos apoyamos mutuamente hacia nuestros
mayores estándares.
Creemos que a través de nuestro trabajo como artistas y
colaboradoras, estamos compartiendo y demostrando una manera de trabajar juntas
para alcanzar metas comunes. Estas metas son incentivar la creatividad, la
empatía, la compasión, la generosidad y la confianza. En nuestro trabajo
colectivo, cada una comparte una perspectiva única y un acercamiento particular
al proceso creativo  y artístico.
En octubre del
2014, logramos reunir el suficiente dinero para cubrir nuestros gastos y
consolidar nuestra primera residencia en Boulder, Colorado (EUA). Desde
entonces nuestro trabajo ha continuado y nos hemos reunido por segunda ocasión
en Boulder para la creación y presentación de una obra de danza, para construir
nuestra página web y para desarrollar la calendarización y presupuesto de
nuestros siguientes 12 meses de trabajo; y embarcadas en esto: nuestra primera
recaudación anual de fondos!This is it: ONE ANNUAL FUNDRAISER!
Esto es definitivo: una única campaña de recaudación al año!!!!By contributing, you will help us cover the costs for:Colorado Residency, USA. April 2015 2 weeks based in Boulder, CO with one workshop at Colorado College, a performance of our new work ALLOY  + a storytelling concert by Paola Suculima De La Concha Zindel in Colorado Springs, 2 additional performances of ALLOY + Paola's concert in Boulder (here's our trailer!).  West Coast Residency, USA. October 20153 weeks in Washington, Oregon and California to make, film and perform Zap McConnell's new project, Secondary Succession.  Secondary Succession will use the ruins of coastal military forts as visual landscapes for a new dance for film. Once created to protect the borders during WWI and WWII, now encroached on by the natural world and often repurposed as state parks and artist centers, these architecturally intriguing structures are already telling many stories.  We will listen, then tell our own.
WEEK 1: We will begin by exploring movement, installation and site specific response to the influences of: military history, moss, Japanese internment camps, Northwest Native American tribes, reservations, parachutes and hot air balloons, Fukushima, the jet stream, pirates and redwoods.Then we will film.
WEEK 2: We will work on building a garden at a permaculture based sustainable community in exchange for space, as we create a live performance based on our film creation. Then we will perform the show there and in Portland, OR.
WEEK 3: Some of us will remain on the West Coast and crush the editing of the film; taking advantage of our time together. When the 3 weeks is up, the project is completed! Then we share it; at planned showings in each of our communities and applying to Dance for Film Festivals. 

Cholula Residency, México. February 2016

2 weeks in Cholula, Puebla, México where Cinthia Pérez Navarro will direct CBC in her new project, Permeabilidad Espontánea.  In this work, we will experiment with our 
permeable bodies when interacting with subjects that are currently 
raiding Mexicans and Americans across our borders. Permeabilidad Espontánea, rises as a 
multidisciplinary contemporary dance work that will underline and unveil
 social and environmental justice issues through the participants’ 
kinesthetic senses and as a collective response from our individual 
perspectives.  In Cholula, we will create, perform and offer workshops in the community. Charlottesville Residency, USA. May 20162 weeks in Charlottesville, VA to conduct the annual business of CBC, as well as  share all that we have created in the last year through workshops and live performance.During each and every residency, we are committed to reaching out to our hosting community with classes and performances.  As much as possible, classes will be free and open to the public and performance ticket prices will be donation based. 


Residencia en
Colorado, EUA 2015
2 semanas de
base en Boulder, Colorado; un taller en el Colegio Colorado (Colorado College), la presentación de nuestra nueba obra ALLOY + un concierto
y cuentacuentos dirigido por Paola de la Concha Zindel en Colorado Springs; y
dos presentaciones adicionales de ALLOY + el concierto de Paola en Boulder. (Aquí nuestro trailer!)
Residencia en
la Costa Oeste, Estados Unidos. Octubre, 2015.
3 semanas en
Washington, Oregon y California para construir, filmar y presentar el nuevo
proyecto de Zap McConnell, Secondary
Succession. Secondary Succession usará las ruinas de los fuertes militares
como paisajes visuales para un nuevo film de danza para la cámara. Creado
originalmente para proteger las fronteras durante la Primera y Segunda Guerras
Mundiales, este espacio se encuentra actualmente tomado por el mundo natural.
Frecuentemente estos espacios son retomados y reactivados por el estado para
convertirse en parques  o centros
artísticos. Estas intrigantes esculturas arquitectónicas, tal y como se
encuentran, ya tienen tantas historias que contarnos. Nosotras escucharemos
para después relatar la propia. 
SEMANA 1:
Comenzaremos explorando movimiento, instalación y trabajo in-situ,  respondiendo a las
influencias de la historia militar, el musgo, los campamentos de reclusión
japonesa, las tribus nativas de Norteamérica, las reservas, paracaídas y globos
aerostáticos, Fukushima, el jet stream,
los piratas y los bosques de los gigantes sequoyas. Después filmaremos.
SEMANA 2:
Trabajaríamos construyendo un jardín de permacultura en una comunidad
sustentable a cambio de espacio, mientras creamos una presentación en vivo
basada en la creación audiovisual. Luego presentaremos en este lugar y en
Portland, Oregon. 
SEMANA 3:
Algunas de nosotras permaneceremos en la Costa Oeste para terminar el proceso
de edición y así aprovechar nuestro tiempo juntas.  Cuando terminen las 3 semanas el proyecto
quedará concluído y estrá listo para ser compartido en presentaciones que
programaremos en nuestras respectivas comunidades y aplicaremos a festivales de
videodanza.
Residencia en
Cholula, México. Febrero 2016.
2 semanas en
Cholula, Puebla, México, en donde Cinthia Pérez Navarro dirigirá CBC en su
nuevo proyecto: Permeabilidad Espontánea.
En este trabajo, experimentaremos con la permeabilidad de nuestros cuerpos al
interactuar con temas que actualmente se encuentran ....mexicanos y
estadounidenses en el cruce de nuestras fronteras. Permeabilidad Espontánea, se erige como una obra de danza
contemporánea, colaborativa y multidisciplinaria que subrayará y develará
problemáticas en relación a la justicia social y ambiental a través del
“sentido kinético” de los participantes y como una respuesta colectiva de
nuestras perspectivas individuales.  En
Cholula crearemos,  presentaremos la obra
y ofreceremos tallertes a la comunidad.
Residencia en
Charlottesville, Virgina. EUA. Mayo 2016
2 semanas en
Charlottesville, Virginia para dirigir los asuntos administrativos de CBC, así
como compartir lo que hemos creado a lo largo del año a través de talleres y
presentaciones.
Durante todas y
cada una de nuestras residencias, nos comprometemos a dar de vuelta y retribuir
con clases y presentaciones a la comunidad que nos recibe. Tanto como sea
posible, las clases y presentaciones serán gratuitas o propondremos que sean
por donativo voluntario. 


We can't do this without you.  Thank you so much for your support!

<p>exploration,
evolution, and expansion of expression through collaboration</p>
<p>Bringing decades of experience in collaborating with
numerous choreographers, dancers, and movement enthusiasts, Michelle Ava
introduces her new initiative, the <b>Joy
of Collaboration</b>.  The vision of this
21<sup>st</sup> century endeavor is <span>to create a space
for integrating artists and artists’ works from a diverse tapestry
of styles, disciplines, and forms. 
This integrative dance laboratory space will promote and support interdisciplinary
and intergenerational workshops, conferences, and performance productions that reflect
our culture today. The aim is to promote learning and exploration in artistic
collaboration and showcase innovative ideas that can make a significant contribution
to the arts. </span></p>
<p>Michelle Ava’s <span>methods, developed
over four decades in teaching and the performing arts, enrich and ignite the
launch of <b>Joy of Collaboration.</b>  Central to the idea
of a laboratory space is the concept of ""playshops"" that
provide a thoughtful but permitting space for exploration.  Innovative methods of facilitation and art direction
guide playshop participants on how to collaboratively create and artistically
extend beyond their boundaries.  These playshops
freely incorporate expressive disciplines and artistic media such as improvisation,
modern dance, music, structure and composition, form development, and mind body
modalities among others. </span></p>
<p>The dancer, choreographer, spiritual explorer, and teacher, Michelle
Ava, brings to the <b>Joy of Collaboration</b>
initiative an informed holistic approach enriched by her lifelong journey of
collaborations. Her passion that resulted in founding Joy of Motion is a testament
to her dedication in guiding countless students to discover their own authentic
dance. Now, by providing a space to explore the challenges and joys of integrating
diverse artistic forces Michelle’s work enters its next evolutionary phase. This
phase offers collaboration methods that explore and contrast artistic styles
while illuminating interactions and their emotional contents. Collaborators are
encouraged to experiment with invention and inspiration utilizing traditional
and non-traditional improvisation techniques.  These methods deepen the connection with self,
with others and with the environment in which artists coexist and co-create.  Experiments in this space can result in artistic
growth opportunities for all collaborating parties. These opportunities often
bloom into short-term or long-term relationships as well as performance
productions that showcase this ensuing artistic magic – the unexpected miracles
propagated by collaboration. </p>

Create an ensemble-governed space where new works were put through their paces, engaging in a lengthy critical process before opening. It's a theatre of thoughtfulness, in which we constantly ask ourselves if the stories we select are worth telling. Rather than jumping in, the question is why -- and more often, why not? Most recently, we are beginning a multi-year collaborative process that is seeking to explore righteousness versus justice. CPT emphasizes transmedia approaches that look to all mediums to broaden stories that emphasize places of difference between peoples and how stories might bridge those gaps.
OUR MISSION: We are inventors at our core. We seek to
take in stories unknown, combine them with vision and action, and bring these
experiences to life through performance. Our ensemble strives to pair our own
development with that of changing communities. We want to stand among and
between states of matter to explore beyond boundaries.

<p>By exposing students and professional dancers to the principles of dance through the artist and theoretical lenses, Mesh Academy of Dance aims to provide performances of high quality, imbued with virtuosity, energy, dynamics, and humanity.</p>

<b>What we need and what you get -  </b><br/><br/><span>The cost of living in Sri Lanka is rising, but income levels are nowhere close to keeping up with them. <br/>Therefore, rent costs are on an all time high with not much return of investment. Right now, I rent a studio to practice for our launching dance production and I haven't started charging children yet. Why? This is the launch, these passionate children believe in me and the vision of Mesh Academy of Dance and most of them can't afford to pay. But they give their time, energy and commitment to seeing this launch through day in and out.</span><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> I realized renting out a studio is going to be a costly affair and not sustainable in the long run. Luckily, we have found a tiny space, but a space that requires restoration. While I am putting most of my savings into this investment (purchase of the space), I am still falling short. And this is where I would like your help. </span></p>
<p><span><span>We require $10,000 for rebuilding certain parts of the space, attaching the wooden flooring, purchasing mirrors and bar handles,  the foundations required for sustaining a dance studio for Mesh Academy of Dance. 25% of the $10,000 will go towards the scholarship pool to help those less fortunate in having a chance to pursue dance and the arts and $1 dollar from each donation will go towards the donation pool for providing a wheel-chair for a cerebral palsy affected child. </span></span></p>
<p>Cerebral palsy is a condition where individuals are deformed from the waist down. There are reported 40,000 cases in Sri Lanka. As a dancer and an athlete, I couldn't even imagine myself not being able to dance or run, let alone walk. Therefore, I have made it a mission to donate and assist with cerebral palsy affected individuals when and wherever I can. Would you help as well? <br/><span></span></p>

We listened, get involvedWe heard from artists, volunteers, patrons and staff. We listened. We're making changes and we want your help. Together our work establishes circus as part of the contemporary arts community both in Chicago and in the United States. Member of the movementGive today and become a member of the movement. Stay informed throughout the year as we share the latest news, programming and developments.  Get an insider's view of the process along with making your support known.  When you give today you'll receive quarterly updates, invitations to special events, great swag and the opportunity to buy your tickets early and at a discount.What does your money buy?CCCF operates without paid staff. Meaning the people who work year round to bring this work to you, do so while maintaining full time jobs and in their free time. They recognize and rejoice in the groundbreaking importance of the festival.Rest assured that YOUR donations will be used to cover the costs of the festival. Artist Fees: $80,000 - It's not a festival without the talent. Our artists graciously discount their fees to help us make the festival possible. Even at dramatically discounted rates bringing great talent from all over the world to Chicago is our top priority and most expensive cost.Venue Rentals: $20,000 - This pays for 3-4 performance and rehearsal spaces throughout the week and gives us time to set-up, tech, rehearse and perform. A week is a very small window of time given the scope of the festival. Schedules are tight but each year we pull it off through long days and a committed volunteer staff. Technicians: $15,000 -Our first year our entire backstage staff was volunteer only. In 2015 we paid half our technicians below market rate and the other half were still volunteer.Equipment Rentals: $8,000 - Covers the cost all things that make a show a show and keep our performers safe: Truss, rigging, lighting, projection and much, much more.CIRQUE MECHANICS: PEDAL PUNK

<i>""Por
 La Luz de la Luna, is a labor of love, that honors Mexican heritage and illustrates to our community that there is
 a place for everyone on the stage — no matter what your background is. 
-Patty O'Reilly""</i><p></p>
<p><i><br/></i>
</p>
<p><b><span>A message from our Director:</span></b></p>
<p>When
 I took over as Director of Sonoma Conservatory of Dance in 2005, I set 
out to continue the ethnic and cultural diversity I grew up with on Air 
Force bases as a child, doing so through the art and discipline of 
dance. I wanted SCD to be a space where diversity is not only nurtured 
but celebrated. </p>
<p>Over
 the past 11 years, the studio has grown into a place that I can proudly 
say educates and fosters an array of beautiful and different cultural 
backgrounds. Sonoma is a community with many Hispanic residents, 
and specifically Mexican, families — something that is also reflected in
 the Studio's student population.</p>
<p><i>-Patricia O'Reilly, ARAD, Artistic Director</i></p>
<p> <i>Por la Luz de la Luna (By the Light of the Moon)</i> is
 a full-length dance performance,  with a cast comprised of children 
ages 6 to 16 as well as adult guest artists from San Francisco and 
Oakland. Our production is a celebration of Mexican culture and the 
diverse landscape of Sonoma’s cultural makeup through the art of dances 
such as Folklorico, Aztec Dance, Classical Ballet, and Waltz.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>The Story of <i>Luna</i><br/>
</h3>
<p>This
 epic Mexican-American tale follows young Lucila who sees the evening 
moon for the first time while her mother, Carmela, explains that her 
ancestors have been adoring the moon for generations.</p>Through
 Carmela’s storytelling, Lucila and audiences are transported into the 
time of Mexico’s Joan of Arc, Jovita, who fought for religious freedom 
during Mexico’s second revolution in the early part of the 20th century;
 then they will travel with Carmelo and Estela who cross the Mexican 
border into the U.S. in search of the proverbial dream; and finally, 
enter the ancient story of the Aztec moon goddess, Coyolxauhqui, whose 
battle with her brother, Huizilopchtli, the sun god, brought light to 
the night sky.<p><br/></p>

 Short Summary


""Por
 La Luz de la Luna, is a labor of love, that honors Mexican heritage and illustrates to our community that there is
 a place for everyone on the stage — no matter what your background is. 
-Patty O'Reilly""


A message from our Director:
When
 I took over as Director of Sonoma Conservatory of Dance in 2005, I set 
out to continue the ethnic and cultural diversity I grew up with on Air 
Force bases as a child, doing so through the art and discipline of 
dance. I wanted SCD to be a space where diversity is not only nurtured 
but celebrated. 
Over
 the past 11 years, the studio has grown into a place that I can proudly 
say educates and fosters an array of beautiful and different cultural 
backgrounds. Sonoma is a community with many Hispanic residents, 
and specifically Mexican, families — something that is also reflected in
 the Studio's student population.
-Patricia O'Reilly, ARAD, Artistic Director
 Por la Luz de la Luna (By the Light of the Moon) is
 a full-length dance performance,  with a cast comprised of children 
ages 6 to 16 as well as adult guest artists from San Francisco and 
Oakland. Our production is a celebration of Mexican culture and the 
diverse landscape of Sonoma’s cultural makeup through the art of dances 
such as Folklorico, Aztec Dance, Classical Ballet, and Waltz.




The Story of Luna

This
 epic Mexican-American tale follows young Lucila who sees the evening 
moon for the first time while her mother, Carmela, explains that her 
ancestors have been adoring the moon for generations.Through
 Carmela’s storytelling, Lucila and audiences are transported into the 
time of Mexico’s Joan of Arc, Jovita, who fought for religious freedom 
during Mexico’s second revolution in the early part of the 20th century;
 then they will travel with Carmelo and Estela who cross the Mexican 
border into the U.S. in search of the proverbial dream; and finally, 
enter the ancient story of the Aztec moon goddess, Coyolxauhqui, whose 
battle with her brother, Huizilopchtli, the sun god, brought light to 
the night sky.
The Real Jovita Valdovinos, 1935

<p><b>What we are doing</b></p>
<p>Staging
Bloody Haymarket, an original theatrical production. </p>
<p>Our goals for the
production are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a bold and engaging
     performance for our audience.</li>
<li>To provide the audience an
     entertaining/ interactive experience</li>
</ul>
<p>To develop a new kind of theatrical involvement.</p>
<p>This
is a production we deeply believe in and want to share with the world. That
includes you, and we would be honored if you would become a part of it.</p>
<p><b>What we need &amp; what
you get</b></p>
<p>This
production has been carefully budgeted, with specially tailored perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are asking for a total of
     $10,000, which will be used to pay for a venue, publicity, and honoraria for
     our incredibly hard-working cast and crew. </li>
<li>All levels of donation are
     deeply appreciated. No amount is too small, and each level of contribution
     comes with a token of our appreciation.</li>
<li>Every dollar raised will go
     towards helping this production reach its potential and our heartfelt
     gratitude.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why we are doing
this </b></p>
<p>The
work we are doing will provide audiences with an entertaining and educational
spectacle about a critical event in Chicago and American history that all
should know about. Our play explores still-relevant issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker’s rights,</li>
<li>Police brutality,</li>
<li>Corrupt politicians, </li>
<li>Immigrant rights, and</li>
<li>Racial discrimination.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We
are not naïve. Living in a theater city, like Chicago, makes standing out hard.
Thankfully, we have two traits to help us shine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our company is made up of
     artists of the highest caliber, who are supremely dedicated to their
     cause.</li>
<li>We have a great story to
     tell.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore,
2016 is the 130<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Haymarket Riot event; what
better way to honor all involved in the event than to tell their story to a
younger audience? We have presented two public stagings of scenes from our
production, which were well received.  The
positive responses we received from those audiences are proof of how strong an
impact our show will have.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If
you can't contribute financially, we understand. This is a group made up of artists
after all.  </p>
<p>There
are plenty of valuable ways to show your support. Sharing this campaign
online will always be appreciated.  </p>

     comes with a token of our appreciation.
Every dollar raised will go
     towards helping this production reach its potential and our heartfelt
     gratitude.

Why we are doing
this 
The
work we are doing will provide audiences with an entertaining and educational
spectacle about a critical event in Chicago and American history that all
should know about. Our play explores still-relevant issues such as:

Worker’s rights,
Police brutality,
Corrupt politicians, 
Immigrant rights, and
Racial discrimination.


Risks & Challenges
We
are not naïve. Living in a theater city, like Chicago, makes standing out hard.
Thankfully, we have two traits to help us shine:

Our company is made up of
     artists of the highest caliber, who are supremely dedicated to their
     cause.
We have a great story to
     tell.  

Furthermore,
2016 is the 130th anniversary of the Haymarket Riot event; what
better way to honor all involved in the event than to tell their story to a
younger audience? We have presented two public stagings of scenes from our
production, which were well received.  The
positive responses we received from those audiences are proof of how strong an
impact our show will have.
Other Ways You Can Help
If
you can't contribute financially, we understand. This is a group made up of artists

</div><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Acorn Productions started the Maine Playwrights Festival as part of 
our mission to nurture theater artists and the local arts community. Now in its 16th year, the MPF is
 Maine's premiere incubator for new plays. Over the years we have been 
proud to present hundreds of world premiere plays, some of which have 
gone on to be produced at festivals in New York and elsewhere. For 
playwrights, this is an invaluable opportunity to see their words 
interpreted by directors and actors and see how audiences react. For the
 actors it is a unique chance to originate characters that will set the 
standard for future productions of the work. For the audience it is an 
introduction to emerging and established playwrights who live and write 
here in Maine. Who knows...some day one of these playwrights could be 
accepting a prestigious award for one of their plays and you can say ""I 
was there when they got their start at the Maine Playwrights Festival!""</p>

<p>""It is so important for us to never forget, though growing up with my
fathers family who escaped the Nazis, sporadically from 1938 to 1942, there was
a need to try to forget that I saw in my grandparents. My father was too young
to remember anything, as he was two when they fled to Paraguay. In my far too
little 22 years that I had with my grandparents, they never mentioned the
Holocaust and I never asked. Many years after they passed away, I began to have
guilt about never asking, but eventually realized that it was the last thing
they would have wanted. For them, the absolute joy of having grandchildren who
could run around free, never having to suffer a moment of what they suffered,
was an undoubted gift to them. Even though they sat in an apartment in Brookline,
MA, not doing a hell of a lot, what a gift to my grandfather saying  not
much but to be able to walk the quarter mile to pray a schul every day…"" R. Neuburger</p>

Something personal:


""It is so important for us to never forget, though growing up with my
fathers family who escaped the Nazis, sporadically from 1938 to 1942, there was
a need to try to forget that I saw in my grandparents. My father was too young
to remember anything, as he was two when they fled to Paraguay. In my far too
little 22 years that I had with my grandparents, they never mentioned the
Holocaust and I never asked. Many years after they passed away, I began to have
guilt about never asking, but eventually realized that it was the last thing
they would have wanted. For them, the absolute joy of having grandchildren who
could run around free, never having to suffer a moment of what they suffered,
was an undoubted gift to them. Even though they sat in an apartment in Brookline,
MA, not doing a hell of a lot, what a gift to my grandfather saying  not
much but to be able to walk the quarter mile to pray a schul every day…"" R. Neuburger",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>I am a young emerging dance artist with a passion for life, collaboration and bringing people together. Money has always been a issue that I quietly ignore as I am passionate about what I do, yet at times it stops me in my tracks.  I am a passionate and enthusiastic teacher, dancer and I am very excited to now being able to explore my choreographic voice for the first time. The body has always fascinated me and this piece has allowed me to explore what my own body can do whilst posing many interesting questions to the audience and myself as a performer.

<p>I have been invited to perform at the festival by American Choreographer Susana B. Williams, which is am amazing opportunity as very few artists have been selected to perform under the 'Danceforms Choreographic Showcase'. Thanks to my AMAZING parents, I have been given a loan (which I will start paying back in september so hopfully I can get more paid work by then haha) which has covered the platform fee of around £1000, which includes my technical rehearsal, accommodation and all my marketing and press coverage at the festival. I still need to raise a lot more in order to have a successful time at the festival. I have very little funds available at present, so any donations will help pay my food so that I may stay fit and healthy. It will also enable me to see other artists work and so make good networking opportunities for possible future work, collaberations and in general to supoort the British arts scene. At a time where the arts could face further cuts from the government, we all need to stand together and help each . The Fringe is the most competitive market in which to advertise a performance, and to help further my networking opportunities and raise ticket sales,I have decided to create my own flyers of which i can advertise myself on the street to all the crowd. This will be funded by myself. Even though i will have the support of Susana's platform, I will be there by myself which is quite daunting.</p>
<p>Any box office share I get from my performances, 10% will be donated B.e.a.t and MacMillan Cancer, two charities very close to my heart. </p>

<p>The perks that you will get for helping me are aimed at me sharing the work with you. Images, a video of my performance, a live sound score of my 'silent' piece and tickets to see the show. </p>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your donation will mean that more people see this work, more people give money to both my chosen charities , more tickets are sold and the run at the Fringe can be a great success.

</div></div>","Short Summary I am a young emerging dance artist with a passion for life, collaboration and bringing people together. Money has always been a issue that I quietly ignore as I am passionate about what I do, yet at times it stops me in my tracks.  I am a passionate and enthusiastic teacher, dancer and I am very excited to now being able to explore my choreographic voice for the first time. The body has always fascinated me and this piece has allowed me to explore what my own body can do whilst posing many interesting questions to the audience and myself as a performer.

</div></div>","Spring 2015 marks Sans Limites Dance’s fifth performance
season, featuring new works by Artistic Director Diana Pettersen that explore the theme of marriage equality, develop a new movement technique
employing only one pointe shoe, and experiment with humor in dance.  These pieces will be performed by Sans Limites Dance Company Members: Elliott Keller, Lindsey Lykowski, Rhys Martin, Susanne McHugh, Casie O'Kane, Taylor Paige, Boonyarith Pankamdech, and Shelley White.
This season will also include the fifth installment of the Sans Limites Dance Guest Choreographers Program.  Since 2013, we have produced pieces by over 30 emerging
and mid-career choreographers at nominal cost to these artists. 

For the first time, we are presenting six choreographers
with the Lounsbery Award, affording them free tech and performance space, light design,
stage management, and marketing. This is made possible by our Technical Director, Michael
Lounsbery, who donates his time, skill, and resources to producing each season.

The inaugural group of Lounsbery Awardees is composed of: Aaron Atkins of Ballet, Inc., Yuka Kawazu of Danse en L'air, Cameron McKinney of Kizuna Dance, Joe Monteleone of Monteleone Collective, Ella Rosewood of Ella Rosewood Dance, and Sarah Zehnder of Zehnder Dance.

Each Sans Limites Dance season not only presents the work of our Artistic Director Diana Pettersen, but also promotes the work of a growing number of choreographers.  We need your support in an effort to push financial
limits out of the picture for our community of choreographers and dancers.
Donations to this campaign will contribute to production
and marketing costs for the Sans Limites Dance Spring and Winter seasons.  Reaching our campaign goal of $12,000 will
allow us to:
offer a new round of Lounsbery Awards,
pay a
select group of choreographers to mount new works in our Winter Season,
increase compensation for Sans Limites Dance company dancers,

and strengthen our promotional efforts in order to widen
exposure for the approximately 30 dance groups participating in our Spring and
Winter seasons.

Choreographers, dancers, and artists of all kinds
continually struggle with keeping their dreams alive.  Your tax-deductible contribution will ensure
this unique communal endeavor toward dance without limits doesn’t fade. 
Help us fill the dance world with this
vision.  Donate now and share our campaign with friends on social media and via e-mail.
