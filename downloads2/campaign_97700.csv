Link to the tests.I saw this man from Oregon who recently asked 50000$ for a ''coolbox'' project 
and people supported him with 3 million ! A project like that doesn't even come 
close to ours in terms of importance so I hope our ''little''project will spark 
at least the amount of people that participate in that little cool-box ! LOL. I 
think it is only a small contribution in comparison what can be achieved with 
this technology and the  REAL change it can bring on the planet and the humans 
on it ! If we keep the donations small but frequent, nobody 
can loose and only a big gain of knowledge that can only inspire other 
researchers to pick it up and run with it ! This way we are all benefiting from it ! Surely anybody can 
understand the impact this will have on our daily lives !What we offer is 
of course updates on the project progress and making the data available for 
anyone. (Twitter & YouTube ) In a finale stage after the 400km drive of course! The total information 
of the device will be provided in print form and video how to build it. 
When the goal is reached we also offer our assisting services to build 
the devices in whatever location they are needed ! Contributions in the form of 
information or hardware parts are highly appreciated ! Offers from electric bike 
manufacturers in the form of lending us a bike are also welcome as you can 
imagine if your brand name on the first bike that made a run of 400KM on only 
this RADIANT ENERGY !Thank you for taking the time to read this info and 
of-course hoping you spend the amount of a few beers to help us proof that FREE 
ENERGY really is out there for everyone ! PS.''THE PERSON WHO SAYS IT 
CANNOT BE DONE SHOULD NOT INTERRUPT THE PERSON DOING IT !'' LOLTESLETIC.COM TWITTERIgor @ YouTubeNicholas @ YouTubeThe original video if YouTube does not work !An explanation why ELECTRICITY=WATER=FREEDOM",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

  Press kit is available for download here  

  
 Ninebot KickScooter Air T15 is an electric scooter with robust functions and an exquisite craftsmanship. The Air T15 team spent over SIX years (nearly 12,500 hours) working on an integrated design with the lightest yet the most durable material for a sleek and futuristic style that elevates your urban commute. With the small details designed to perfection, the Air T15 will be your reliable and stylish companion.  The KickScooter that Folds Flat Seamlessly   
 The Air T15 can be folded in half with just one click. Once folded, the 6-axis sensor embedded in the dashboard will detect the operation mode and help to turn the power off automatically.  
 When folded you can easily move the KickScooter around. The Air T15 is designed to be drag-able like a suitcase once folded. The compact size and lightweight make it even more convenient for you to store the KickScooter in the car trunk or carry it with you on public transportation. 
 
  Ergonomically Designed For Your Comfort  
  We believe in using premium materials and delivering a superior product. The body of the Air T15 is made with aluminum-magnesium alloy to bring a lighter yet stronger and more reliable performance. This also ensures that the body of the vehicle is splash-proof, corrosion-resistant and eco-friendly. 
 Ingrained with a necessary precision and attention to detail, our designers and engineers bring the simple yet sophisticated style to life, presenting to you the elongated L-shape when Air T15 is in use and a simple flat line when the scooter is completely folded.  
 When you first grip on the ergonomically designed handlebar, you will be surprised by the level of comfort the silica material delivers. The bezel-less monitoring dashboard is intuitive to use and also part of the integrated look that elevates your commute experience.  
 Every detail of the Air T15’s design exudes quality. To further enhance the user experience, we designed the DIP switches on the rear fender for users to power on/off, control the light, and change the riding modes.  The bar and tail lights of Air T15 are designed to light up your way ahead in style. Riders can choose from three colors under different scenarios: Monochromatic, Full Color, or Emergency Light. 
 
 When the KickScooter is folded, the handlebar will self-retract, leaving you with a hassle-free user experience like no other. 

 The bezel-less dashboard of Air T15 is embedded with LED nixie tubes and provides you the extra convenience to monitor the speed, battery life, riding modes, Bluetooth connection, cruise control status, and error messages of the scooter all in one click. 
 
 The regenerative braking system turns your e-scooter into an electric vehicle powered by electricity and recycled energy from riding. The wheels are able to transform the energy that is captured during braking into power and to store it in the integrated lithium battery pack.  
 The four riding modes allow riders to switch easily based on riding occasions. Such modes include Pedestrian Mode, Energy-saving Mode, Standard Mode and Sport Mode with a preset speed limit of 3.7 mph (6 km/h), 6.2 mph (10 km/h), 9.3 mph (15 km/h), and 12.4 mph (20 km/h) respectively.
 
 The Segway-Ninebot App is available on iOS and Android with integration of Bluetooth connectivity, customize LED ambient light colors, live riding stats dashboard, and more. 
 
You can stand your scooters either vertically or horizontally. The stands that come with the product packaging can be used as a KickScooter stand for storage and ease of charging. Both stands included are made with Expanded Polypropylene (EPP) materials that are recyclable.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With the launch of the Bolt M-1 and GEN7 a few years ago we had numerous challenges that rose from developing a supply chain for a one of a kind 72V 2.4-kilowatt-hour battery and RFID enabled technology.  The complexity in sourcing and allocating buildout times for those motorbikes was a challenge.  The support from our customers and fans really helped us out.  This experience taught us to ensure we are prepared to launch before we announce the next product.  Before we launched on Indiegogo, we have sourced all components, engineered the custom aluminum alloy frame design, developed the battery technology, and much more to overcome the challenges we had in the past.  We are more prepared to execute today than ever before in the history of Monday Motorbikes.  With a nice stream of GEN7 motorbikes we are excited to start the flow of the Gateway and Gateway Booster from the same facility that we create our GEN7s from.</p>

Like a heart muscle your battery loses health if you do not use it enough. To help you PRESERVE BATTERY LIFE, you should recharge it completely, between 2 and 4 hours, at least once a month if not used for a little while. If you omit this MANDATORY MAINTENANCE alone, its chemical integrity (and consequently its capacity and autonomy) will suddenly drop.<br/>In case of a return, we will run a diagnosis and if it appears the failure is due to a lack of proper maintenance, the warranty will not apply.</p><p><strong><u>How long does the battery of our HIPPO e-Bike last?</u></strong></p><p>Battery life is calculated in charge cycles. This means it depends on the number of full charges (from 0 to 100%) that they can undergo before their effectiveness gradually diminishes, until they no longer function. Our HIPPO battery can undergo 800 charge cycles. The way you take care of your battery will also affect its life. For example, if you store your battery somewhere dry and protected from temperature fluctuations, you will keep it longer.

Well constructed at this price point, customizable, this eBike will get anyone to enjoy cycling more often, putting less efforts on uphill roads, savor the outdoors, stay healthier and have fun.      Designed as a go-anywhere eBike, the Hippo handles pavement as well as it does dirt. The wide handlebars make it easy to maneuver, just as easy as a regular bicycle.    This is certainly one of the safest system: it allows you to control your level of assist without moving your hand from the handlebar, and without having to look at the buttons (that means, with buttons that are easy to reach). The +/- control buttons are separated from the display, well-positioned on the left side of the handlebar: changing the level of pedal assistance require no special skills. It can support up to 9 levels of PAS.   Monitor your riding habits at a glance: speed readings, distance, time and battery life are highly visible.We opted-in for internal cable routing, for a cleaner aesthetic, while protecting against dirt and tangled cables.  Model 350W featured in this videoEncountering staircases? No need to turn around, the Hippo is just doing fine riding down. With a strong frame, a front suspension fork, and 4” fat tires, it is outfitted to handle some rough terrain. Hydraulic Disc Brakes: 500W Model - When riding an electric bike with its higher speed, stopping power is a high priority. These hydraulic disc brakes provide superior braking control, especially in poor weather.   Together Let’s Make It HappenThe final modifications and adjustments on this prototype were finalized last December.

<p><span><b>     </b>We have developed a special charger that operates in a voltage range of 90-264 VAC. The duration depends on power capacity, on average 4 hour.</span></p>
</div><br/><p><br/></p></div>","Have you ever traveled to the wilderness, away from the road? But the roar of engines was still been heard just a few steps away from you? This is group of ATV-fans drove past …
We wondered how to save the situation, because such mode of transport is becoming more prevalent. Even yesterday, where it was possible to enjoy the tranquility and fresh air, are now rumbling machines, air polluting by exhaust gases.
     Smart and high-power eATV from Velectrico will help prevent the environmental disaster and the annoying noise!





    Our eATV will also be useful for the groups exploring wild nature. With the function ""road train"" leading machine can get the way for the 3 slave machines.
Extra battery packs and charging from the solar panels allow to plan real autonomous expedition.
The eATV io20 is capable for a long time charge and supply the various special equipment, such as smart phones, cameras, lighting equipment.
Fans of thrills will enjoy dynamic acceleration and good speed.
Specially designed the four motors control technology does not leave any chance to get stuck in the middle of a huge mud puddle.
The sealed frame will help overcome a ford even if the whole eATV will disappear under water.
Automatic notification system will send to smartphone information about the battery charge, the power reserve, the temperature of motor windings and other useful information.What if you need to overcome the river not to wet the feet? You can walk on a pedestrian bridge, and eATV with a remote control software installed on your smartphone independently will overcome all obstacles.


    Our team specializes in the development of different gadgets and power electronics. We promptly conducted R&D and started prototyping phase
    Currently for project Velectrico eATV io20 has already been developed:

Motor-wheel construct with an unique motor BLDC by own design                               


Battery managment system 





Frame


Four motors control technology





Instrument cluster



   

    The project is realized on the personal funds of our team, so any financial support will significantly speed up the development.
     We need funds to produce a prototype and funds for pre-production.
    We hope that the success of our project on Indiegogo will push many people to think about the environmental problem and to begin actively invest to the development of eco transport.

start-up costs of the first production run.

this page with your friends or by pre-ordering your own FlipCrown ! 









A
little less short


Who
Are We?

Up close and personal, we are Patrick Jacquet and
Rob De Schutter,
both fathers and both bike-aficionados. We run a small design
& development firm called DeltaReference based in the city of
Ghent, Belgium.
The last 7 years we have been working and cooperating on several ideas
and products in the toy industry. We've also built prototypes for other
companies including medical appliances, automated payment kiosks
&
consumer electronics. 

Venturing into the bike
industry with FlipCrown was a logical next step for the
bike-o-philiacs* we are. Besides FlipCrown we are working
on other exciting bike-related products.  (* not to be taken all too literally)


Why
we came up with FlipCrown

One can call us naive, but
we believe bikes are
an important answer
to some of the world's most pressing problems. Bikes (including
E-bikes) provide sustainable transport for an increasingly urbanizing
world population, reduce traffic congestion, don't pollute our city's ,
they help fight the growing obesity pandemic, and are even effective in
combating depression!

With FlipCrown we
want to be a part of this movement, helping to make a bike just
that little extra touch more convenient in crowded cities,
small hallways and tight apartments.  



Why
we need your help?

FlipCrown
is a product for bike-lovers and perfectionists, but also for people
who are radically practical and want their bikes when they need them
and out of the way when they don't. The major bicycle
manufacturers won't take on such a niche product, so with this campaign
we want to rally the people that do see the point of slimming down
their bike. By supporting our campaign we can cover the cost of a
minimum order to start manufacturing and get a FlipCrown into your
hands! 




How
far along are we?



 OUR PROTOTYPES...

We've
gone through all stages of turning an idea into a reality. Sketching,
CAD modeling, prototyping, testing, the molds have been produced and the first samples have
been made...
we have selected final manufacturers to produce the FlipCrown. We have
a quality control manager available to check the quality of the
manufactured products. And last but not least we've looked into the
best options for delivering the FlipCrown to your doorstep and made
arrangements so everything runs smoothly. 
So
in short all we have to do in terms of producing our item once the
campaign is successful is tell the factory to go and follow up!

FAQ
How do I Use FlipCrown?

1.Loosen Stem-bolt    2.Push FlipCrown Button   3.Flip Handlebars 

Will
it fit my bike? 

FlipCrown
was designed for so called 'threaded headsets' which are easily
recognizable. Just take a look at how the quill (this is the part that holds the handlebars) attaches to the fork (this is the part that holds the front wheel). If you are not sure, you can send us a picture and we will help you out. Send to info@deltareference.com

Note; sometimes the top bolt of a threaded headset is
hidden under a cap.


Left: Threaded                           Right:non-threaded

(BTW: we are also
working on a solution for non-threaded stems, drop us a line if you can use one!)




What size FlipCrown do I need?
We
offer two sizes, 1"" and 1 1/8"". You do not need to determine this
before ordering. Once you order we will contact you and give you
guidelines to determine which size FlipCrown is for you.


Is it hard to install?

Nope.
Follow along with the provided instructions and you should be ready
within 15 minutes. Once we have our production samples we will create
an online tutorial, and a manual will be provided with your FlipCrown.




Is it safe?
Yes, it is perfectly safe and will not influence your bike’s steering, handling nor driving.


What
tools do I need?


We
will supply you with 2 custom wrenches that can be used to install both
the FlipCrown and the Quick Release pedals. In most cases you can use
this wrench to unscrew the original headset crown nut, but in some
cases you might need some extra leverage or a different
tool. You
can either use a pipe to extend the provided wrenches grip or use your
own tools instead. The FlipCrown is fastened onto the quill stem and
steerer tube with 3 setscrews, an Allen key is provided for this
purpose.


Do
you have a girl's/women's model bike?

Slim
bike is fun for boys and girls, but we do encourage to wear pants, keep
a watch on us tough, we are looking at releasing a great-looking
women's model soon!

Other
Ways You Can Help

Even
if the FlipCrown is not for you (right now :)  ) you can still
help! If you share this page with some of your bike-loving friends,
they might decide they can put a FlipCrown to good use:

We
realize FlipCrown is not for everyone, but we're sure you know some
people who could use one! A hipster friend that keeps his fixie-bike in
his bedroom perhaps?

Share our page with
the buttons beneath the campaign video! Remember: sharing is caring!



The
Risks & Challenges

Let
us be honest, we're not big risk takers over here, we like to take well
thought out and planned decisions. Before we even considered launching
a crowd funding campaign we looked into everything that went wrong in
other campaigns. 

We
paid extra attention to the logistics side, which tends to falter in
some crowd-sourcing campaigns. We calculated the costs every step of
the way, right up to your doorstep. We've set up a realistic deadline,
based on our manufacturers estimates + we calculated in a reasonable
margin of error on their side.

This is indeed our
first crowd-sourcing campaign, but we hope to reach out with more
complex projects in the future. We
chose to start with FlipCrown precisely because it is a relatively
modest project. We
are absolutely confident that with your help we can make the FlipCrown
a reality! 


thank
you so much for your support!
The
FlipCrown Team,
Patrick
& Rob.

<h3>The Skyber Association Project. </h3>
<p>What's better than convenient travel? Options for upgrading and receiving even more conveniences. Hey I'm Dave, I've been doing guest services at the OIA for nearly 20 years. A couple of my comrades and I are working on an idea that will make air travelers, and customers in general feel even more at ease when they travel. Anybody that contributes will qualify for travel discount prizes once this idea gradually surfaces, and becomes an available product. The monies contributed here on our first campaign, will go into the production phases of the project. I'm delivering intentional vagueness here because of the cut-throat business culture of airports. I can only give a small amount of information in the idea phase. But if anyone residing in Orlando wants to know a little bit more on this idea, just drop by and see us at the Lee Vista Chik Filet, 2 miles north of OIA (Orlando International Airport). Home base for this project is in Orlando, and we do our pow-wows usually on Friday nights from 8:30pm til 11. If you decide to come through, just ask for Glenna (our waitress, and she'll introduce you to us) Thank you to everyone that contributes, and God bless.   </p>

</h3>
<p>Founded in 2007 we have been operating out of the City Heights Farmers Market since 2009 and are eager to move to a more permanent location where we can provide more consistent and reliable service. <br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>By getting a space we will be able to have more accessible bike 
repairs, longer hours, and more educational workshops open to the 
public. This will allow us to get many more bikes fixed and on the road!
 This will also provide our volunteers ample space to evolve the 
organization with many possible opportunities.</li>
<li>Currently, we operate each Saturday at a local farmer's market. Although we love the market we find that it is difficult to grow and provide for the needs of our community with the current one day a week model.<br/>
</li> <li>We would like to raise $10,000. This will give BdP the freedom to have 6 months rent as well as created a reserve, giving us time to stabilize a regular income to continue to sustain our space.</li>
<li>This campaign will grant BdP the ability to provide donations based services. BdP believes in providing services to any and all in need. Our services should and will continue to be available everyone no matter their socio-economic status.  We achieve this by operating with sliding scale pricing for parts, and free access to tools.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>BdP has been working in the City Heights community since 2007. We are now ready to take the natural next steps in acquiring and sustaining a permanent place in our neighborhood. This progression is necessary in spreading the accessibility and sustainability we have been providing to the farmer's market community for the last 7 years.</li> <li>In addition to the Saturday market, we have worked alongside many valuable partners. One organization we would like to highlight our work with is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). This international non-profit works in refugee resettlement. Over 1,000 refugees are brought to San Diego every year and rely on public transportation to get to and from their job until they are able to purchase a car. BdP has been working with the IRC to provide refugees with working bicycles to get them around their new city. BdP has also hosted workshops for refugees to learn simple bike repairs and maintenance. This is especially important because many refugees, when they first arrive in this country, are on some sort of government assistance program and unable to pay for extra costs like bike repairs. Acquiring a full time space would allow for BdP to take on other projects similar to the one with the IRC.</li>
<li>BdP also hosts bi-weekly build nights that are open and available to the public. BdP will offer guidance to anyone in need of simple to moderate repairs for their bicycle. We provide tools and any parts that are available.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>By obtaining a space, BdP will be better equipped to meet our mission. If we are unable to raise the necessary monies to get our space, we will set aside a reserve fund to continue to add to until we are able to meet our ultimate goal of $10,000. We want our potential funders to feel confident they understand where their much appreciated donations will be going towards. BdP strives for complete transparency with our volunteers, community, board members and supporters.</p>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <ul>
<li>If you are unable to donate, we still need support and help spreading the word about our fundraiser. Your assistance distributing and advertising our month long campaign is showing your solidarity with BdP and that's all we could ask of you. </li>
<li>Please share this via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email, text and/or any other sort of distribution or social media you feel would help us reach more people. We want to meet our fundraising goal but we also want to share our mission with people who are unfamiliar with BdP and our services.  We would love it, if at the end of the day, maybe we didn't meet our goal yet we reached many more people who didn't yet know about us or the work we do. </li>
<li>To our current supporters in the bike community, thank you for your dedication and love you have shown us since our beginning in 2007. To those who have not heard of us before this campaign, we hope you come visit us at the Saturday market and talk to us about our mission and hopefully feel drawn to help support a grassroots organization trying to advocate for bicycle education and transportation self-sufficiency. </li>

<p>The convenience of Bisecu comes from multiple safety devices with state of the art technology. Numerous tests have been conducted to verify reliability. <strong>Bisecu is never locked on the ride. </strong>Bisecu’s integrated 4 sensors sense even the smallest motion on the ride.</p>
<p><strong>If any of these sensors sense your bike’s motion, auto-lock, lock does not operate.</strong> Thanks to these sensitive sensors, Bisecu will only be locked when your bike is at stop for <strong>at least 5 seconds.</strong> It does not matter whether your smartphone is turned off or the battery dies.</p>

We always thought traditional bike locks have lots of problems. So we thought innovating the lock would make bike riding experience more pleasurable.
 
 
 

 

 
Bisecu is a fully automatic smart bike lock
 

Bisecu has a completely different form factor from traditional bike locks and with its unique design, it is integrated with IOT technology.  Bisecu is a worlds first smart bike lock that is fully automatic.
 
 

 

 
 
  
 
  
 
In addition Bisecu is designed to create a natural harmony with the bike while becoming part of the bike.
 
 

 

 
One of the key points of Bisecu is that your phone is the key to the lock. You can remotely lock and unlock Bisecu with your smartphone.
 
 
On automatic mode, Bisecu recognizes the distance of your phone and will lock automatically as you walk away and unlock as you approach. You do not need to carry your keys, locks anymore. This means that you can save your time by parking and just leave.
 
 

 

 
Bisecu’s locking mechanism is hidden from the outside covered with durable aluminum alloy. Therefore, cutting is arduous. The front wheels can not be rotated in the locked state.
 
 

 


 
Bisecu also has a built in alarm system so that when it is locked and senses a motion, 100db alarm will trigger while sending push notifications to your smart phone.
 
 
 
  
 


 
If you need long parking use additional connecting cables for double security. The cables are also linked with motion sensors within Bisecu so your smartphone is still the key to the lock.(Additional connecting cables are under development. Coming soon.)
 
 

      


 
The convenience of Bisecu comes from multiple safety devices with state of the art technology. Numerous tests have been conducted to verify reliability. Bisecu is never locked on the ride. Bisecu’s integrated 4 sensors sense even the smallest motion on the ride.
If any of these sensors sense your bike’s motion, auto-lock, lock does not operate. Thanks to these sensitive sensors, Bisecu will only be locked when your bike is at stop for at least 5 seconds. It does not matter whether your smartphone is turned off or the battery dies.
 

 

 


 
You can charge Bisecu through its micro USB cable. One Full charge takes only 2 hours and you can use it for up to 6 months. If the battery dies 1 minute charge will enable you to use bisecu for at least an hour so you can go home safely.
 
 

  

 
Traditional bike locks need to be bigger and heavier to have a better performance. Bisecu has a unique cylinder design so it is uncuttable and only ways 0.35kg. 
Once Bisecu is mounted on your bike you don’t need to worry about anything, just enjoy your ride.
 
 
 


 
 

 
Bisecu is not just a good looking lock but it is also a smart cycling device.
 

Providing you with accurate real time riding data such as time, distance, speed and even calories burnt through multiple motion sensors inside Bisecu.
The data is automatically saved and you can grasp your own driving information and set your goals to enjoy a smarter ride.
 
 

 

 
Try setting up a more precise goals by analyzing your daily saved riding data. Bisecu can be a good motivation for your cycling.
 
 

 

 

 
On the App you can easily share your bike and use it with many people.
 
 

 

 
Download now in the app store and google play store.
 
 

 

 
 
            Bisecu is attachable on normal spoke styles as shown on the image on the left. It cannot be mounted on special spoke types of wheels as shown on the image on the right.   The diameter of the bicycle's front wheel hub should be less than 72mm (= 2.83 Inches).* Although the length is shorter than 72mm, it cannot be mounted on dynamo hubs.   Bisecu cannot be mounted on L-shaped forks as shown on the image on the right.* It cannot be mounted on Thru Axle types.   The thickness of the fork should be 20mm (0.8 Inches) or less, and the width of the fork should be 40mm (1.6 Inches) or less for installation.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Carbon SUV ebike is a durable choice for off-road riding in the country near home and in such remote regions as the open spaces of the Australian outback, Africa, the Middle East, Alaska, Canada, Iceland, South America, Russia; as well as in regions with limited paved roads, such as parts of Asia, that require vehicles capable of handling all kinds of terrains. The superb riding capabilities of Carbon SUV ebike provide a major safety advantage to people in areas with gravel roads in summer and snow and ice in winter, desert zones, dirty, rough roads outside cities, and in any extreme conditions such as riding through high water. </span><br/></p>

A ""Sport Utility Vehicle / SUV"" is defined as ""a large vehicle that is designed to be used on rough surfaces but that is often used on city roads or highways”. The Carbon ebike is perhaps the most advanced concept of e-bike available today. It could be interpreted as a hybrid bicycle/motorcycle: a lightweight device which releases large amounts of power. Still a true bicycle that you can enjoy in every sense of the word, it offers you much more in terms of usability, performance and freedom: the SUV ebike®.

The Carbon SUV ebike is a superior e-bike in terms of performance, comfort, technology, and brand image.

Engineering has to approve the basic proportions of an e-bike, and those basic proportions determine 60% of the design but an essential part of a successful styling process is to create a reaction from consumers ... and, hopefully, a compelling vision of the future direction of e-bikes development. Top e-bikes like Carbon are more than just simple transportation. They strangle attention. A combination of weapon-grade speed, sex, beauty and freedom found between two tires. Carbon is the icon of that.


















Carbon SUV ebike is a durable choice for off-road riding in the country near home and in such remote regions as the open spaces of the Australian outback, Africa, the Middle East, Alaska, Canada, Iceland, South America, Russia; as well as in regions with limited paved roads, such as parts of Asia, that require vehicles capable of handling all kinds of terrains. The superb riding capabilities of Carbon SUV ebike provide a major safety advantage to people in areas with gravel roads in summer and snow and ice in winter, desert zones, dirty, rough roads outside cities, and in any extreme conditions such as riding through high water. 



TIMELINE









The Carbon SUV ebike features a carbon frame and an aluminium fork, leading-edge components and is designed around the latest bicycle technology. It will be manufactured in Asia and we can guarantee a world-class production cost-to-quality ratio. 

Manufacturing carbon e-bikes at top quality standards is significantly more difficult than manufacturing conventional e-bikes. There are only a handful of manufacturers that have the skill set and experience to do it properly. And I know them very well. 
The unique Carbon SUV ebike is quite different from the other e-bikes, even carbon e-bikes. Carbon SUV ebike needs closest attention to details to be manufactured to perfection. This is why I am overseeing the process in person, every single day: this is my full time job, my commitment and my passion. 
We will ship from Asia to anywhere around the world. All Carbon eBikes will come pre-tuned and ready to ride. However, we ask that you take it to your local bicycle shop for final, personalized tuning prior to your first ride. 
All units will be carefully packed for shipping. All orders will include online parcel tracking and insurance. Additional duties/taxes may apply depending on your destination country.

For additional details, please check our spec sheet below. Our team began developing e-bike conversion kits since 2011, with a dream to create greener, cleaner, and more affordable transportation. Since then we have received numerous awards and patents with our e-Bike kits.In 2015, we decided to develop and build full fledged electric bikes, in addition to our kits. With successful delivery of our first generation G-Bike in 2016, we began development for G-Bike's 2nd generation using valuable feedback from G-Bike users.We are coming to Indiegogo for our 2nd generation G-Bikes because we believe that with Indiegogo we’ll be able to scale up production and deliver G-Bike at its most affordable price ever. Here are some of pictures of our first generation G-Bikes that were produced in small scale last year. This has been a deep learning experience in terms of development, manufacturing for us. This year, we plan to QA each bike ourselves when they are manufactured to ensure the quality of each bike before we start shipping.

<h3>The Event</h3>
<p>The annual Power Racing competition at MakerFaire Bay Area is a contest where grown men and women race against each other using hot-rodded Power Wheels toy cars. It is glorious and hilarious, and this year I'm building a car to race in the competition and I could use your support. </p>
<p>The event takes place on the weekend of May 20th-21st at the <a href=""http://makerfaire.com/bay-area/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bay Area Maker Faire</a> in San Mateo, CA. It is open to the public and it is an incredible amount of fun. </p>

<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<div>I'm Donald Bell and I run a site and YouTube channel called <a href=""http://makerprojectlab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maker Project Lab</a>. I'm a former Project Editor with Make: magazine. I produce a weekly DIY roundup video called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHvctKwAXIO93gMWere3Yfa7VXI3dHs16"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maker Update</a>. I love taking on challenges like this and I'm excited to finally race in a Power Racing Series competition. This is my debut as a Power Racer, and I want go big.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Why I Could Use Your Money</h3>
<p>This is my first truly ambitious DIY project. To make a competition worthy vehicle capable of sustaining speeds of up to 20 mph without falling apart, I'll need the help of my team and the financial help of my extended team of supporters -- you guys!</p>
<p>The racing rules require certain aspects of the car to fall within a $500 budget. Items such as batteries, safety equipment, brakes, helmets, and all necessary tools fall outside of this budget, however. I have already invested over $1,000 on this endeavor and it would mean a lot to me and our team if your support could offset the cost of this ambitious and adorable electric car.</p>
<p>To show our appreciation, we've worked with local illustrator <a href=""http://ellingson.cc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Josh Ellingson</a> (whom we'd also like to give some money for his effort) to create a sticker and pin design that fans of my mine or fans of Power Racing will be excited to get their hands on.</p>
<p>Also, don't you just kinda want to tell people that you're sponsoring a mini race car called ""Kitty Grabs Back""? Don't you want to be a part of making that exist in the world? Of course you do!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Car</h3>
<p>Some people choose their cars, Sometimes, the car chooses you. When you're searching through Craigslist for used, cheap Power Wheels, you have to jump on the first good offer you find. In my case, a dad in El Cerrito was offloading a non-functional Hello Kitty branded ride-on car he'd bought at Target for his daughter. $25 later, the car was mine. </p>
<p>Maybe it was the Audi-style chrome bow on the grille, or maybe it was just the thought of a grown man driving in a Hello Kitty car -- but it was love at first sight.</p>
<p>The stock specs on this thing are about as bad as it gets. It's much smaller than most name brand Power Wheels (this one's made by Dynacraft) and aside from the shell it's a total gut job. </p>
<p>We're rebuilding every functional part of this car from steel -- the frame, the axles, steering, gearing, wheel hubs -- all custom. The end result is going to be a dual-motor, 24v speed demon based on the excellent design work of Volpin Props' <a href=""http://www.volpinprops.com/the-marriott-chariot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marriott Chariot</a>.</p>
<p>For power, we're going a little extreme. The 24v supplied to the motors will be provided from a stack of rechargeable Lithium Ion battery packs salvaged from a Nissan Leaf. These are known as Leaf cells, they're not cheap (and hard to come by the real thing), and take some knowhow to wire up without creating some impromptu fireworks. Fortunately, I'm not doing this alone.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>I've got a great team helping me make this car a reality. Jordan Bunker is a former Technical Editor with Make: magazine (where we worked together), currently working as an evangelist for Hackaday. He has an amazing knowledge of fabrication techniques. He's already built and raced a car for Power Racing Series, and he's also worked to setup and referee several races over the years. Jordan is my secret weapon.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge in front of us is figuring out how to reliably charge and work with the Leaf cell batteries. These batteries can't be charged from a standard R/C battery system, but instead need a repurposed high-watt server rack power supply to provide enough juice.

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MINI E-BOAT EVER

Sleek and Functional DESIGN !
What you’re looking at here is the world’s first electric and eco-friendly mini eBoat, now on the market – "" the Jimboats 6.5"".
 

 
That’s remarkable. How big is it?
It’s just 6.5ft long – that’s exactly 2m. That’s a full half meter less than the beam of a Sea Ray 190 sportsboat, for example.
Width is : 3.3 ft / 100 cm and it needs only 1 foot of water to go !
 

Astonishing. So it would fit in the back of my pick-up?
Absolutely! In fact, here is a shot of it in the bed of a double cab.

 

What makes it go?
A ""standard"" 500W - 12 Volts electric motor providing 55lb of thrust spins a 3 blades propeller that is concealed within a tunnel, safe from dangling legs or swimmers.

 

How fast is it?
With the 500W ""standard"" motor, the speed is 6.5 Mph ( 5.5 knots ), controlled by a five-step throttle (limitable). It provides complete control for a smooth ride.
It also offers a single-speed reverse.

Good sensations and nice acceleration, all pleasure !

 
And how long will it run for?
About four hours on a full charge. 4 hours of pure pleasure !
 

Is it just for kids, or can grownups have a play?
It’s aimed predominantly at children, but small adults (up to 5ft 6in and 155lbs) can have a go.

1. Do you ship JimBoats 6.5 worldwide ?
Yes, JimBoats 6.5 is shipped worldwide (United States, Canada, Europe and Australia, etc...).  On the payment menu, you can check if the shipping is available to your country.
2. Does the price of a perk include the shipping charge ? 
The price does not include the shipping charge. If you select your country on the payment menu, you can check the shipping charge based on your country. 
For example, the shipping charge to United States for ""Early Bird"" is $199  USD. 
3. Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT for international orders?
Import duty tax or VAT may need to be paid if your country requires it.
4. Is there a warranty on my JimBoats 6.5 ?
Yes. We will offer one year limited warranty on all JimBoats 6.5.
Note: this does not cover damages incurred by rider usage. Any alteration, tampering or modification of the electronics, battery, controller, motor or related electrical wiring will not be serviced or supported by JimBoats and will void the warranty.
5. How long will JimBoats 6.5 run for?
4 hours depending on the weight of the crew and the wind. It could be more than 6 hours at medium speed !
6. Does the price of my JimBoats 6.5 include the battery ?
It depends on your perk choice. There are some perks without battery: "" Light Bird"", ""Sound Bird"" and ""Rental Bird"". We offer this option to reduce the shipping cost and the selling price.
7. What about the battery?
Our goal is not to earn money by selling batteries or to force you to buy our batteries. We decided to use ""Marine grade Bluetop"" batteries from Optima. You can always buy other brands of deep cycle batteries.
    You can buy these batteries everywhere in the world !
8. How long does it take to fully charge the battery ?
For a JimBoats 6.5  with standard ""D34M""- 55Ah battery, approximately 5 hours with the specific ""Optima battery charger"" or 7~9 hours and with a ""classic"" battery charger for cars, trucks etc...
9. What is the maximum size to ride a JimBoats 6.5 mini boat ?
We recommend under 170cm (5'6"") for the best riding experience.
10. What is the maximum weight to ride a JimBoats 6.5 mini boat ?
We recommend under 70kgs (155lbs) for the best riding experience.
11. Where can JimBoats 6.5 mini boat be serviced?
JimBoats 6.5 mini boat is designed to be simple enough for anyone to replace parts on their own. We will provide written and video documentation of possible replacement processes.

SAFETY RULES :
6.5 isn’t a toy like any other, its use must be made under adult supervision and responsibility. Like any other nautical activity, a life jacket is strongly advised. Some countries even require it. Inquire about it. There are smartphone or walkie-talkie holders, to communicate with the driver.",71.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I already fly my body. I've done over 300 skydives. It started as a small annual achievement. But I never leave a passion half way done. Now I have 3 Licenses and jumped in competitions. I don't know how far this love will take me, It's been very lovely so far.</p>

<h3>Flying Airplanes</h3>
<p>The project you are supporting me with is not an idea. I'm already taking flying classes.</p>
<p>If I have a real dream, I plan for it, I budget for it, and I will make it happen. It just takes a lot longer when I chase them on my own. If I have supporters I will probably achieve it sooner. Well if the weather permits.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Flying so far</h3>
<p>My instructor is very happy with my progress. After one of the classes she told me that I'm way above average.</p>
<p>I'm comfortable with being in the sky. Perhaps my brief exprience of skydiving helps too.</p>
<p>Since I have passion for flying, I've been studying the books and manual very seriously. My collegues sometimes see me late at work studying the flying exercises.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>By helping me to learn to fly, you are not participating in putting me at a risk. I'm more at risk staying still. Also flying is so pleasant and beautiful, the exprience is far from being at risk or feeling at risk.</p>

<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>When I'm around you, I fill the room with energy and my wonderful stories of floating in the sky.</p>
<p>I'll make you fly even if you are affraid of heights. Having someone like me around makes everyone believe their dreams are achievable.</p>
<p>Unlike skydiving that feels a bit crazy, when I get my Pilot license, we can go fly together for real.</p>

    e-motion your bike with add-efrom bike to e-bike within seconds
add-e NEXTintroduction
You love cycling but because it can be exhausting you are thinking about an e-bike? Even more, you love your own bike and don´t want to replace it for a heavy and bulky e-bike?add-e is the answer !New technologies, high quality materials and Austrian engineering make it possible to convert your own bike into an e-bike with style, in no time! With add-e you can choose to use your bike as a normal bicycle or as an e-bike. You can have 2 in 1.No additional space needed, eco-friendly and most of all with add-e you save money. Just pimp your own beloved bike and do some easygoing cycling, but with style. 
add-e NEXTWhat's new?The new generation of add-e, add-e NEXT does no longer struggle with screeching noise nor do we use hall sensors with magnets that are limited in accuracy.This is a totally new generation of the smallest and lightest add-on kit, once again leading the way for the future in cycling.In the previous generations of add-e we were limited by some basic conditions, like the computing power of the microcontroller and discontinuous sensor values for speed and cadence. Now we are doing a complete redesign, reinventing ourselves. The add-e NEXT will not only calculate the motor movement 1000 times faster but also power the motor in a consistent way that reduces the noise level nearly to zero.The new electronics using latest FET technology makes the whole drive much more efficient, especially when going up a hill with low speed but high motor power.Therefore add-e NEXT can assist much better when using the motor on a gradient.The new wireless sensors allow us to calculate the speed of the wheel continuously.Compared to the previous version where the magnet had to pass the sensor twice to calculate the wheel movement, this is much more accurate.Enabling us to overcome the delay when starting from standstill situations.You can adjust the values for minimum speed and cadence via the add-e app (will be available for iOS and Android). Now you can decide how long the motor should stay active, even if you pedal very relaxed. Also new functions like free programmed max.Speed and Power will be implemented (only for Sport Edition). The installation will be so simple and you no longer have to struggle with different mounting possibilities.  
add-efirst installationadd-e NEXT can be fitted to almost any bicycle without trouble, by using the mounting brackets included in every set. You can mount add-e by yourself without having to make modifications to your bike. There are two perfect solutions for nearly every bike.
Type 1 (bottom bracket shell): is the ideal solution for racing bikes, mountain bikes and various types of trekking bikes. The frame around the pedal bearing is standard which simplifies the fitting. In this case the add-e mounting plate fits between the bottom bracket shell and the frame. To fasten securely the bottom bracket has to be screwed tigh 
Type 2 (Kickstand fitting): is the ideal solution for city bikes and older bicycles with a classical kickstand bracket. With this type the mounting plate is fitted onto the kickstand bracket. An add-e kickstand bracket is included in every set.However, if you are not quite sure which version you need send us an email andwe will be pleased to assist you.

<p>Steven LaCroix is a massage therapist offering Bodywork for Life Balance in Bellingham, WA. A mindful man with a kind heart, his presence and skilled technique have helped hundreds of people experience physical, mental, and emotional relief and healing both on and off the massage table. Alongside offering massage and healing touch to the community, Steven co-facilitates a contact-improv jam twice/month, participates in a variety of workshops and events around town, and is a welcome, friendly face throughout the community. He's also a delightful dork :) </p>
<p><strong>What you may not know about Steven</strong> is that he rides his bicycle, Sprocket, everywhere. He's had his driver's license for 17 years, but has <em>NEVER </em>owned a car. How many people do you know who can say that? Sprocket, Steven's current bicycle, has been Steven's trusty steed for over five years. While's he a loyal hunk of metal and serves his purpose well, Sprocket is too small for Steven. He's also a mountain bike which is much more challenging to commute on than, say, a commuter bike. We'd like to give Steven the gift of swift, easy, practical, and fun transportation around town, as well as the possibility of joining friends on longer tours. That's why we're asking for your help! </p>
<p>Oh yeah, <strong>Steven lives in Bellingham where it rains A LOT</strong>, all the time (it's raining right now). Unfortunately, Steven doesn't have any waterproof bags. Sometimes he carries his laundry from his massage practice back and forth from work to home in a backpack that looks like it should make him fall over backwards. He's a trooper, but it can be easier. If this project is funded, we will get Steven a set of waterproof panniers (bike bags) that will protect his belongings from the weather as well as his back from the weight. </p>
<p>With the help of friends, family, and our larger community, a little here and a little there will go a long way towards improving his daily commute. To receive a gift like this from someone's community is an amazing statement of love and support. Please consider donating to help Steven continue helping others in a way that supports his body as well as his ability to move around town with more joy and ease! </p>

</div> <p></p>
<p>VOMO is the ultimate light electric vehicle! This high performance electric scooter is packed with features, including a powerful 350-Watt motor with a 20 MPH top speed! </p>
</div><div>
<div>Whether it is commuting to work, getting to the subway or bus stop, running errands, short trips are now super easy and fun with VOMO. In a car we have to deal with traffic, and parking. On a bicycle, we work up a sweat and then have to find a safe place to lock it up.</div>
<div>
<p>We felt there had to be a better way to handle these short trips. Our goal at VEETRON was to build the best light electric vehicle in the world so VOMO was created!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">VOMO is Speedy</h3>
<div>VOMO comes standard with a 350 Watt hub motor that propels you up to 20 mph! </div>
<div>Many electric scooters on the market just do not have the power and speed needed to really get going and zoom up hills but not with VOMO, we wanted to build a scooter that offered high performance and the ability to take you anywhere!</div>

<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">VOMO Goes Everywhere With You</h3>
<div>With a size of 29cmx89cmx16cm when folded it is compact enough to be taken anywhere.</div>
<div>We designed VOMO so you can take it everywhere you want to go with a very quick and simple folding action and the ability to <b>roll it</b> when needed just like a suitcase. </div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">VOMO Gives a Smooth Ride</h3>
<div>Many electric scooters we tried offer non inflatable hard plastic wheels but we were disappointed at the handling and safety of the ride.</div>
<div>After extensive testing we decided to go with durable (8x2 Inch) tubeless inflatable tires offering the very best handling and the ability to smooth out those nasty bumps in the road. </div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">VOMO Has a Digital Display</h3>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">VOMO Goes the Distance</h3>
<div>VOMO comes in two battery configurations, 8.8A battery model or 11.6A battery model. Both models using the very latest Samsung Lithium Ion 18650 Battery technology to offer the best range possible. </div>
<div>Our tests have reached ranges of over 20 miles on a single charge!</div>
</div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">VOMO Stops When You Need To</h3>
<div>Safety is super important so we have equipped VOMO with a ""safe-start"" function meaning that if you twist the throttle when standing still it will not accelerate avoiding any non-intentional acceleration in a crowded area. </div>
<div></div>We also fitted VOMO with a 120mm disc brake to give the very best stopping power when needed. </div>
<div>Some electric scooters only offer regenerative braking but we found this simply wasn't safe enough for us as this gives no braking power if electric supply is cut off.</div>
<div>The 120mm disc brake was by far the best performing and safest option to go with.</div>
<div>VOMO also comes as standard with a built in motor cut off switch. Simply apply the brake as normal and the power supply to the motor will automatically cut off while the brake is applied. <br/><div><br/></div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">VOMO is Strong and Light</h3>
<div>VOMO is made from high grade aluminium offering not only the strength and rigidity needed but also lightness. </div>
</div>
<div>Keeping the body design ultralight and yet strong we were able to design the VOMO to weigh in from just 14kg. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">VOMO is Affordable</h3>
<div>There was no point in us designing a scooter that the vast majority of people couldn't afford, it is our mission to make light electric vehicles available for everyone. <br/>
</div>
</div>
<div>We are offering our INDIEGOGO supporters the ability to get a VOMO at a very special price of $599 with free shipping! (Shipping normally extra)</div>
<div></div>We encourage you to shop around for other electric scooters just to see how low our pricing is. You will have a hard time finding anything else priced this low and definitely not with the top speed and range that VOMO offers.</div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">VOMO Comes with a Warranty!</h3>
<div>At VEETRON we are so confident with the quality of our scooters so they always come with a 12 month limited warranty giving you peace of mind. </div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why VOMO Needs Your Support?</h3>
</div>
<p></p>To help bring VOMO to market, we’re seeking to raise funds that will help us launch into full-scale production.</div>
<div>
<p>Indiegogo is the only place in the world that you can buy a VOMO scooter right now. Ordering today helps us kickstart our production and in return, you'll be one of the first to get your VOMO scooter. <b> </b></p>
<div>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, we need your help to spread the word. If we can get more people to know about our scooter we can continue to develop and improve upon it given the feedback we receive from you!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h3>
<p><b>Is it legal to ride VOMO? </b>US State laws vary. Some state laws approve the use of electric scooters in bike lanes of general road traffic and some do not. To the best of our knowledge  e-scooters are street legal in California, Connecticut, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and Washington, with many other states expected to follow suit. All countries have their own rules on light electric vehicles so it’s best to consult with your local transportation authority.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div><p><b>What is the range? </b>This depends on many factors such as riding style. rider weight, terrain and conditions. As a general guide our 8.8A model is capable of a range of 15miles plus and our 11.6A model can do 20miles plus. </p></div>
<div><p><b>Does it come with a warranty? </b>We are offering a one (1) year warranty on all parts for ""non normal wear"". This means any defective parts we will replace within the 1st year. </p></div>
<div>
<p><b>How does shipping work? </b>We send all deliveries out from either Hong Kong or directly from our factory in China. We use various carriers depending on what country you are based in and we will contact you by email before final delivery with tracking number details so you can track the progress.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Do I have to pay import duty? </b>Import duty or VAT may need to be paid if your country requires it. VAT or import duty will need to be paid before final delivery, in most cases if there is duty to be paid the delivery company will contact you and they will have the ability to accept payment either online, by phone or with the delivery driver directly.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Can it go uphill? </b>For sure! Because of the power that VOMO has it can go up a 15 degree incline which should be adequate for most roads. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The steepest hill we have gone up is over 20 degrees.  </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>What is the load capacity? </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Maximum recommended load capacity is 120kg.</span></p>
<p><b>Can I change the speed limit from 20mph? </b>Yes, you can change the speed limit and have it 'unlimited'. You also can change the display from MPH to KPH.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Do you offer a local pick up service? </b>Unfortunately we are not offering a local pickup option at this time. In future we hope to have a base in USA and Europe that allows local pick up. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Can I buy from any dealers? </b>We do not have any dealers at present though we are looking to take on local dealers as soon as we can. If you are a dealership that would like to stock our products we would love to hear from you.</p>
<p><b>Can I change the battery myself? </b>Yes, it is a simple process of unscrewing the top plate on the scooter and unplugging. </p>
<p><b>How can you keep the price of VOMO so low? </b>From the outset it has been our mission to provide our products at the best price we can without compromising on quality. We have been working closely with our suppliers for a long time so that we are able to manufacture our scooter at the lowest price we can. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>How can I contact you? </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">You can email us at hello@veetron.com</span></p>
<p><b>Can I get a refund? </b>We understand that things happen, we will do everything we can to be fair and just. Indiegogo stipulates in their Terms that all contributions are non-refundable, but upon successful completion of our campaign we work one-on-one with backers to determine appropriate refunds if applicable. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Do you sell spares? </b>Yes, We plan on offering replacement parts through a network of local dealers as well as offering direct sales from ourselves. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>What is the minimum and maximum rider height? </b>There are no absolute minimums or maximums, the handlebars can be set at from 110cm to 120cm off ground level and we have had riders comfortably ride VOMO that range in height from 4'11"" to 6'6"". </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>Is VOMO fully assembled when delivered? </b>Absolutely. Simply unpack and it's ready to go. When your VOMO arrives the battery will be about 50% charged.</p>
<p><b>Is VOMO waterproof? </b>The scooter is water resistant (splash proof) though not to be submerged under water. With that being said, we do recommend to avoid riding in the rain for safety reasons. Always wipe out water afterwards and keep it dry to preserve the scooters life. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>How do I choose the color? </b>After you have paid for your VOMO including shipping you can email us your color choice ""silver or black"" to hello@veetron.com. Please make sure you check your spam folder for any emails from hello@veetron.com. We will email you back confirming your color, you should keep that email for your records. UPDATE: From 19th August 2015 any new orders can now select the reuired color option at time of ordering by selecting the correct perk. </p>
<p><b>If the battery runs out can I kick the scooter along?</b> Yes absolutely. VOMO is designed to be kicked along just like any other kick scooter with the electrics either turned on or off.</p>
<p><b>How do I let you know my shipping address? </b>When selecting the perk for your VOMO it will ask you for shipping address at the payment stage. If you have also selected any other perks we will ship them to the same address as you used for delivery of your VOMO. Please also email us a contact phone number so we can pass onto the delivery company. </p>
</div>
<div>
<b>What is the difference between the VOMO Models? </b>8.8A and 11.6A refer to the battery size for the model. It is either 36V 8.8A or 36V 11.6A. The 11.6A Battery offers a longer range.</div>
<div><p><b>Can I use the battery charger in my country, what is the voltage? </b>Yes! Our chargers work with voltages from 100V to 240V. We will also be sending you a plug extension that works for your country plug socket.  </p></div>
<div>
<p><b>How do I fix a flat tire? </b>VOMO comes with durable tubeless inflatable tires and the same puncture repair kits that can be used on tubeless cycle tires can be used on VOMO. </p>

</div></div>","VOMO is Here!
 
VOMO is the ultimate light electric vehicle! This high performance electric scooter is packed with features, including a powerful 350-Watt motor with a 20 MPH top speed! 

Whether it is commuting to work, getting to the subway or bus stop, running errands, short trips are now super easy and fun with VOMO. In a car we have to deal with traffic, and parking. On a bicycle, we work up a sweat and then have to find a safe place to lock it up.

We felt there had to be a better way to handle these short trips. Our goal at VEETRON was to build the best light electric vehicle in the world so VOMO was created!




 

VOMO is Speedy
VOMO comes standard with a 350 Watt hub motor that propels you up to 20 mph! 
Many electric scooters on the market just do not have the power and speed needed to really get going and zoom up hills but not with VOMO, we wanted to build a scooter that offered high performance and the ability to take you anywhere!



 

VOMO Goes Everywhere With You
With a size of 29cmx89cmx16cm when folded it is compact enough to be taken anywhere.
We designed VOMO so you can take it everywhere you want to go with a very quick and simple folding action and the ability to roll it when needed just like a suitcase. 




VOMO Gives a Smooth Ride
Many electric scooters we tried offer non inflatable hard plastic wheels but we were disappointed at the handling and safety of the ride.
After extensive testing we decided to go with durable (8x2 Inch) tubeless inflatable tires offering the very best handling and the ability to smooth out those nasty bumps in the road. 






VOMO Has a Digital Display
We wanted to make sure that VOMO offered the very latest LCD display technology.
Our LCD display offers many functions to the rider:
5 Power assist levels






Total odometer



Trip odometer



RPM reading 














Voltage reading


Display readings in KPH or MPH



Battery level reading 







VOMO In The Media







VOMO Goes the Distance
VOMO comes in two battery configurations, 8.8A battery model or 11.6A battery model. Both models using the very latest Samsung Lithium Ion 18650 Battery technology to offer the best range possible. 
Our tests have reached ranges of over 20 miles on a single charge!






VOMO Stops When You Need To
Safety is super important so we have equipped VOMO with a ""safe-start"" function meaning that if you twist the throttle when standing still it will not accelerate avoiding any non-intentional acceleration in a crowded area. 
We also fitted VOMO with a 120mm disc brake to give the very best stopping power when needed. 
Some electric scooters only offer regenerative braking but we found this simply wasn't safe enough for us as this gives no braking power if electric supply is cut off.
The 120mm disc brake was by far the best performing and safest option to go with.
VOMO also comes as standard with a built in motor cut off switch. Simply apply the brake as normal and the power supply to the motor will automatically cut off while the brake is applied. 


VOMO is Strong and Light
VOMO is made from high grade aluminium offering not only the strength and rigidity needed but also lightness. 

Keeping the body design ultralight and yet strong we were able to design the VOMO to weigh in from just 14kg. 


VOMO is Affordable
There was no point in us designing a scooter that the vast majority of people couldn't afford, it is our mission to make light electric vehicles available for everyone. 


We are offering our INDIEGOGO supporters the ability to get a VOMO at a very special price of $599 with free shipping! (Shipping normally extra)
We encourage you to shop around for other electric scooters just to see how low our pricing is. You will have a hard time finding anything else priced this low and definitely not with the top speed and range that VOMO offers.






VOMO Colors
VOMO is available in two colors, either MATTE BLACK or ALUMINIUM SILVER.
Please make sure you select the perk that matches the color you would like.

VOMO Comes with a Warranty!
At VEETRON we are so confident with the quality of our scooters so they always come with a 12 month limited warranty giving you peace of mind. 



Why VOMO Needs Your Support?

To help bring VOMO to market, we’re seeking to raise funds that will help us launch into full-scale production.

Indiegogo is the only place in the world that you can buy a VOMO scooter right now. Ordering today helps us kickstart our production and in return, you'll be one of the first to get your VOMO scooter.  



Most importantly, we need your help to spread the word. If we can get more people to know about our scooter we can continue to develop and improve upon it given the feedback we receive from you!

FAQ
Is it legal to ride VOMO? US State laws vary. Some state laws approve the use of electric scooters in bike lanes of general road traffic and some do not. To the best of our knowledge  e-scooters are street legal in California, Connecticut, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and Washington, with many other states expected to follow suit. All countries have their own rules on light electric vehicles so it’s best to consult with your local transportation authority.



What is the range? This depends on many factors such as riding style. rider weight, terrain and conditions. As a general guide our 8.8A model is capable of a range of 15miles plus and our 11.6A model can do 20miles plus. 
Does it come with a warranty? We are offering a one (1) year warranty on all parts for ""non normal wear"". This means any defective parts we will replace within the 1st year. 

How does shipping work? We send all deliveries out from either Hong Kong or directly from our factory in China. We use various carriers depending on what country you are based in and we will contact you by email before final delivery with tracking number details so you can track the progress.  


Do I have to pay import duty? Import duty or VAT may need to be paid if your country requires it. VAT or import duty will need to be paid before final delivery, in most cases if there is duty to be paid the delivery company will contact you and they will have the ability to accept payment either online, by phone or with the delivery driver directly. 
Can it go uphill? For sure! Because of the power that VOMO has it can go up a 15 degree incline which should be adequate for most roads. The steepest hill we have gone up is over 20 degrees.  


What is the load capacity? Maximum recommended load capacity is 120kg.
Can I change the speed limit from 20mph? Yes, you can change the speed limit and have it 'unlimited'. You also can change the display from MPH to KPH.


Do you offer a local pick up service? Unfortunately we are not offering a local pickup option at this time. In future we hope to have a base in USA and Europe that allows local pick up. 


Can I buy from any dealers? We do not have any dealers at present though we are looking to take on local dealers as soon as we can. If you are a dealership that would like to stock our products we would love to hear from you.
Can I change the battery myself? Yes, it is a simple process of unscrewing the top plate on the scooter and unplugging. 
How can you keep the price of VOMO so low? From the outset it has been our mission to provide our products at the best price we can without compromising on quality. We have been working closely with our suppliers for a long time so that we are able to manufacture our scooter at the lowest price we can. 


How can I contact you? You can email us at hello@veetron.com
Can I get a refund? We understand that things happen, we will do everything we can to be fair and just. Indiegogo stipulates in their Terms that all contributions are non-refundable, but upon successful completion of our campaign we work one-on-one with backers to determine appropriate refunds if applicable. 


Do you sell spares? Yes, We plan on offering replacement parts through a network of local dealers as well as offering direct sales from ourselves. 


What is the minimum and maximum rider height? There are no absolute minimums or maximums, the handlebars can be set at from 110cm to 120cm off ground level and we have had riders comfortably ride VOMO that range in height from 4'11"" to 6'6"". 


Is VOMO fully assembled when delivered? Absolutely. Simply unpack and it's ready to go. When your VOMO arrives the battery will be about 50% charged.
Is VOMO waterproof? The scooter is water resistant (splash proof) though not to be submerged under water. With that being said, we do recommend to avoid riding in the rain for safety reasons. Always wipe out water afterwards and keep it dry to preserve the scooters life. 


How do I choose the color? After you have paid for your VOMO including shipping you can email us your color choice ""silver or black"" to hello@veetron.com. Please make sure you check your spam folder for any emails from hello@veetron.com. We will email you back confirming your color, you should keep that email for your records. UPDATE: From 19th August 2015 any new orders can now select the reuired color option at time of ordering by selecting the correct perk. 
If the battery runs out can I kick the scooter along? Yes absolutely. VOMO is designed to be kicked along just like any other kick scooter with the electrics either turned on or off.
How do I let you know my shipping address? When selecting the perk for your VOMO it will ask you for shipping address at the payment stage. If you have also selected any other perks we will ship them to the same address as you used for delivery of your VOMO. Please also email us a contact phone number so we can pass onto the delivery company. 


What is the difference between the VOMO Models? 8.8A and 11.6A refer to the battery size for the model. It is either 36V 8.8A or 36V 11.6A. The 11.6A Battery offers a longer range.
Can I use the battery charger in my country, what is the voltage? Yes! Our chargers work with voltages from 100V to 240V. We will also be sending you a plug extension that works for your country plug socket.  

How do I fix a flat tire? VOMO comes with durable tubeless inflatable tires and the same puncture repair kits that can be used on tubeless cycle tires can be used on VOMO.

MOTORCYCLE LAND SPEED RECORD AT OVER 265.33 KMPH IN AUSTRALIA. WE'VE SET A TARGET OF 270 KMPH!

The record attempt will be held as a Special
Feature event of the Temora 1000 on October
25th 2014. The attempt is registered with the Guinness Book of World Records.













Ben is a former world champion rower and has a host
of medals and records to his name in both rowing
and cricket, representing Australia in both sports. Ben was instrumental in establishing rowing as paralympic sport. Ben is currently the President of Blind Sports NSW. 









Not content to just tackle this single record
attempt; Ben plans to launch the In Sight of
Dreams Foundation. In addition to inspiring young people to achieve their dreams, the In Sight of Freams Foundation wants to start a Motorsports Club for people with a disability. 





   What We Need & What You Get 
Can you help us by contributing towards raising the ~$150,000 its going to take to tackle this event and set up the In Sight of Dreams Foundation? Funds will go towards the cost of the bike, the timing & comms equipment, regulatory and legal fees, as well as making sure the team of mechanics, engineers and chase riders can make the attempt possible. Remaining funds will be directed towards the establishment of the foundation..
Oh, and we are looking for sponsors to! If your company would like to sponsor the attempt we would love to hear from you.
Any contribution you can make will help us get closer to achieving our target. Donate $27 and we will send you an autogrpahed poster.
Come and join us on this ride by being part of Club270! If you donate $270 you will  officially be a member of Club270 and be recognised on our website blindspeed.com.au . In addition, you'll recieve a limited edition signed T-Shirt. 
We also have limited number of Club270 Executive and Club270 Executive Plus   options available. Not only will you be recognised on the website but you'll get other benefits as well.
All funds will be put towards the Attempt, regardless of whether we reach the target or not. 

  The Impact Ultimately what Ben hopes to do by making this Attempt is to inspire people, disabled  or not to achieve their dreams. The Blindfold Motorcycle Land Speed Record Attempt is just a launch pad towards setting up the In Sight of Dreams Foundation. The Foundation will : 
Mentor young people
Inspire young people to achieve their dreams
Support key charities that support the blind
Start a motorcycle club to give people with a disability a track experience  
Ben has set up several successful sporting associations such as Sailability and was instrumental in making rowing a Paralympic sport. 

  Risks & Challenges  Getting to the Attempt is no mean feat. In addition to financial costs there are a host of regulatory and technical issues to deal with. Key to this challenge is communication between Ben and his Chase Riders , without out whom Ben could not make the Attempt. In Ben's words, riding the bike is the easy bit!
Ben is a former Motorbike racing enthusiast. 
Ben has put together a team of experts in the field to help him overcome the many challenges the Attempt will throw  at him. These expert include the team at Motorcycle NSW, Motorcycle Australia, Australian Racing Drivers Club, Sydney Motorsport Park, Temora Shire Council, Suzuki Australia, Western Motorcycles and the organising committee of the Temora 1000.
Ben will be riding a Suzuki Hayabusa 2014 which can reach speeds well over the 270kmph required. 
Ben also has the support of a range of organisations such as Shark Helmets,  Berik, 4community, Suzuki and Moto Motion just to name a few who are all contributing to make sure this Attempt is a success.

""... iBike has a clean, retro-inspired look, weighs under 30 lb (13.6 kg), and a crowd-funding project tag below US$500. Is this the e-bike you've been waiting for?""

""Coolpeds' iBike aims to relieve two of the most common e-bike pain points: high cost and heavy weight.""Coolpeds USA has already successfully completed and delivered on a few super cool crowdfunding campaigns!Transform your commute into a green and smile-inducing experience!Introducing the world's most affordable and  lightweight electric bike.The Coolpeds iBike is ready to revolutionize the electric bike industry with its super light weight (about 29 lb), powerful 350 Watt brushless motor, and front wheel drive system for easier handling.


                          STYLISH




We designed our entire bike to be beautiful down to the details.  We created a gorgeous retro style bike and finished it with a genuine leather seat and grips.  The battery is even concealed in a matching leather-look pouch (unlike other electric bikes that have very large and tacky plastic battery compartments).  So you can ride through town stylishly and effortlessly, surprising everyone with how you get there so fast and still look so good!This is the most updated picture of the Coolpeds iBike showing the REAR BRAKE and the free upgraded leather BATTERY BAG with metal twist and magnet locks!


We now offer a straight handle bar option at no extra cost!

                 ULTRA LIGHTWEIGHT



Just as much as we want to make you look good, we want to make your life easier. So we made sure to build the lightest e-bike out there.  We maximized style, function, and power while minimizing any excess bulk with a lightweight frame and slim tires.  Some other e-bikes weigh a hefty 50 pounds, which is difficult to carry around town, especially on daily commutes.  





Our electric bike weighs an amazing 29 pounds, which makes it easier to carry and accessible for many more people. It is light enough to be carried down steps to the subway, pushed through town in crowded areas, or carried with you wherever you need to go.  The smart LCD display control unit lets you adjust the top speed limit (power assist)  from levels 1-5.












      EASY TO RIDE & COMFORTABLE
Start riding immediately at the push of a button or by pedaling.  The spring cushion leather seat and tall handle bar provide a comfortable seat and riding posture.  The Smart LCD display also helps you customize your max speed setting and check your speed, battery level, and range traveled.

We use  a Front Hub Motor that with combined with your own pedal power creates an All-Wheel Drive Fat Tire Electric Bike. This powerful E-Bike literally has no limits. We have a 750 watt and 1000 watt option for you to choose from.You can now cycle upstairs, over logs, and over most any obstacle your bottom bracket can clear and even some it can’t. The All-Terrain System allows cycling on even the softest sand, snow, deep mud, and gravel. For a <strong>LIMITED TIME</strong> only you can purchase our electric bikes for under <strong>$1000</strong>.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1359498/files/20150406094551-Xtreme_Fat_Tire_E-Bike_Can_Climb_Stairs.png?1428338751"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><i>This Electric Bike is Literally  Unstoppable!!!!!</i></b></p><p><b><i>Why Front Wheel Drive?</i></b></p><p>Here's Why: By taking our ultimate Fat Bike and adding our Front Wheel Drive Electric System we feel we have designed a <b><i>ONE OF A KIND E-Bike.</i></b></p><p>Most Electric Bikes are either rear wheel drive mid - drive, rear system.  This puts all the torque on the rear and as anyone who has ever driven through soft terrain like sand, snow, mud or over obstacles like curbs, stairs or logs, would know front wheel drive torque performs better.</p><p>With the motor in the front, you can go through any terrain. Also, with others rear torque systems, at top speed, in soft terrain, when you attempt to turn you easily could dig the wheel in and cause a dangerous situation.</p><p>With our E-Bike, you just power through those turns. And by adding a little pedal power you have an <b><i>ALL-WHEEL DRIVE  E-BIKE </i></b> that will cycle through any terrain and over it almost anything!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1359485/files/20150406094227-Front_Wheel_Drive.png?1428338547"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Choose from the sleek E-Grizzly with matte black frame and fork and yellow neon rims or are game stalker E-Cherokee with camouflage frame, fork and rims.

<p>If you are a commuter, looking to protect the environment, or just a person looking to save money on  gas, then this e bike is for you. You can easily get around town, avoid traffic jams and enjoy the outdoors on our Electric Bikes.</p>
<p>Other great uses for our fat E-Bikes are for hunters, or a rider looking to go places they have only been able to get to on foot before, or someone that’s just up for some xtreme riding.</p>

<p style=""font-style: italic;""><b>What makes Xtreme’s eBike so much
better than the rest?</b></p>
<p><b>Our Safety Features:</b></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><b><i>Our Braking System:</i></b><b style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">We only use Avid Disc Rotors and Calipers and we use a 180mm
rotor on both the Front and Rear for maximum stopping power.</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><b><i><br/>Our eBike Motor:</i></b><b style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">Our motor only works with your
thumb on the throttle; it shuts off automatically when you release it.</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><b style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><i><br/>Our Tires:</i></b><br/></p>
<p>Our Fat Tires are the widest width available which provides stability and superior
stopping power.</p>
<p>Most other Fat Tire E-Bikes utilize either Center or Rear
Wheel Drive Systems. This not only is a Safety Factor in Loose or Soft Terrain
but, it also prohibits their ability to move through loose terrain or over
obstacles.</p>
<p>The Rear Wheel Drive System is proven to turn poorly in Soft
Terrain and can be hard to maneuver which can be dangerous at high speeds in
soft terrain such as snow, grass or sand.</p>
<p>The Center Wheel Drive Systems can become unstable on
uneven terrains and negotiating obstacles and have far more difficulty in
climbing obstacles compared to the ALL-Wheel Drive System.</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><b><i>We have designed the first ever ALL-WHEEL Drive for
SUPERIOR SAFETY and BEST for getting through most any terrain, and over
obstacles!</i></b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">Our
Copyrighted Skull Tire with its’ 5” width is made of Puncture-Resistant Rubber and is currently the <b>WIDEST FAT TIRE</b>
being  manufactured.</p>

<br/>
<p>This tire is not only the coolest out there, but is very functional as
well with its Center Bead. </p>
<p>You can Ride on only 10mm of
tire when on hard surfaces and with 5” of width you have the widest tire made
for soft terrain. This tire works with 5 PSI to 30 PSI, so it can be flattened
out for very Soft Terrain and add pressure to 30 PSI for the road. This tire
with its large air capacity acts just like a Shock for Jumps and Rough Terrain.</p>
<p><b><i>Electric Bike Battery:</i></b></p>
<p>Our batteries are made by Greenway, one of the
top Battery Manufacturers is Asia. It uses a separate Water Bottle
Mount that is not part of the battery like most other companies use and can be
easily removed without having to take off any wires from the battery. This
battery has a sealed shell that is completely <b><i><span>Water
Proof </span></i></b>with its own built in
voltage meter to tell if it needs a charge or not. Plus it has a neat carrying
handle attached to it for <b><i>Easy Removal  </i></b>to
carry for security or take with you to charge. This comes either as a 36 Volt or
48 Volt system and uses only the best Lithium Ion Technology with Sony Cells.</p>

<h1><b><i>FAQs - Frequently Asked Questions:</i></b></h1>
<p><b><span>Why Doesn’t Our Bike Have
Shocks?</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Installing
shocks on a Fat Tire Bike offers no significant value. The Fat Tires behave
like shocks due to the large volume of air they contain and will cushion your
ride over rough terrain and obstacles.</p>
<p><b>Why is Xtreme E-Bike the Only
“REAL” Fat Tire E-Bike</b>?</p>
<p>Fat
Tire Electric Bikes with Rear Wheel Motors are really not true Fat Tire E-Bikes
they are really just Electric Bikes with Fat Tires and are limited to cycling
on streets and hard terrain.</p>
<p>Here’s
why:</p>
<p>The Rear
Wheel Drive E-Bike’s front wheel will dig in and bog down in loose terrain, making
it dangerous to ride. In addition, the E-Bike not drive over loose terrain and obstacles.
Everyone in the auto industry will tell you Front Wheel Drive is preferred in
snow and dirt and that All Wheel Drive is the most effective method for riding to
places you cannot get to with Rear Wheel Drive. Our Xtreme E-Bike will allow
you to cycle in any and all terrain. You will not get this with a Rear Wheel Fat
Tire E-Bike. Instead all you get is an E-Bike with the look of a Fat Tire Bike!</p>
<p><b><span>Our Electric Bike is
Front Wheel Drive. What Exactly Does This Mean? </span></b></p>
<p>The
Front Wheel Drive makes our Bike the only All-Terrain Electric Bike currently
in production. The Xtreme E-Bike can take you anywhere. You can ride on sand,
snow, mud, upstairs and over obstacles. No other E-Bike in today’s market will
allow you to do anything except ride on streets and other hard surfaces. If you
are someone who enjoys riding on the beach, in the snow, on trails as well as
the street, than this is the best E-Bike for you.</p>
<p><b>What Makes Our Company Better
and Able to Guarantee You Will Receive a Bike? </b></p>
<p>We
have already produced and sold close to 100 “Real” Fat Tire E-Bikes. Our Xtreme
E-Bikes are not only being used for personal use but for commercial use as
rental units at beach and ski resorts. What better way to tour the country side
of a resort town than on a Fat Tire All Terrain E-Bike?</p>
<p>We
have recently sold several E-Bikes to a company that conducts cavern tours at
the Louisville Mega Cavern, a 100 acre set of caves system in Louisville,
Kentucky.</p>
<p>In
addition, we have received only positive feedback from everyone who has tested
and ridden our E-Bikes. They all agree that Front Wheel Drive combined with
peddling power allows them much more freedom to ride to places that they could
not go with a Rear Wheel Drive E-Bike.</p>
<p><b>What is the Difference between
the E-Cherokee and E-Grizzly? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>These
are the exact same E-Bike. The E-Cherokee is all Camouflage; the E-Grizzly is
Matte Black with Neon Yellow Rims. </p>
<p><b>What is the Difference between
the 750 Watt and 1000 Watt E-Bike? </b></p>
<p>Power
is the only difference between our 750 Watt and 1000 Watt Electric Bikes.

</p>
<p><span>The 1000
Watt has more power which you can use to get a little more speed to about 25
MPH and climbing and riding over obstacles; the 750 Watt will reach speeds of
20 MPH and while it cycles over obstacles, it does have less climbing power.</span></p>
<p><b><span><b>How Do you get maximum Speed from your E-Bike?</b><br/></span></b></p>
<p><span>Check and make sure that none of your brake pads are rubbing the tires. Also, be sure that your tires are inflated to 28 Ibs.</span></p>
<p><br/><span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b><span><b>How Do I get a correct reading from my Spedometer?</b></span></b></p>
<p><span>Spedometers measure speed based on the diameter of tires. Most are not calibrated to proper settings. Make sure it is set at 29.5 tire diameter to ensure proper readings.<br/></span></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b> How Far can you Travel
on a Charged Battery?</b></p>
<p>Both
the 750 Watt and the 1000 Watt Electric Bike can go around 20 Miles on hard
surface at top speed without any peddling. The distance will vary if you are on
soft terrain or going up hills as that takes more power.</p>
<p>If
you add peddling to your journey you can substantially increase the distance
you can travel on a fully charged battery.</p>
<p><b>How
Long Does it Take to Fully Charge the Battery?</b></p>
<p>A completely depleted battery takes approximately three hours to
charge.</p>
<p><b>How
Long Will the Battery Last?</b></p>
<p>The battery is rated to last 500 cycles. A cycle = depleting a battery
then fully charging it 500 times. So how long the battery last depends on how
much usage. Most batteries last a lot longer than 500 Cycles more like
1000-1500 Charges because, typically a battery is never completed depleted
prior to charging.</p>
<p><b>What
is Our Warranty with Our Electric Bikes?</b></p>
<p>We offer a one year manufacturer’s warranty on all parts except
the battery which is warrantied for six months. <br/>
<br/>
We also offer an extended warranty for an additional year to cover the
electrical components excluding the battery available for purchase at $150.00 </p>

</div></div>","Xtreme Fat Tire Bikes and Components team have designed a Electric Fat Bike that can cycle through any terrain and over many obstacles. We use  a Front Hub Motor that with combined with your own pedal power creates an All-Wheel Drive Fat Tire Electric Bike. This powerful E-Bike literally has no limits. We have a 750 watt and 1000 watt option for you to choose from.You can now cycle upstairs, over logs, and over most any obstacle your bottom bracket can clear and even some it can’t. The All-Terrain System allows cycling on even the softest sand, snow, deep mud, and gravel. For a LIMITED TIME only you can purchase our electric bikes for under $1000.This Electric Bike is Literally  Unstoppable!!!!!Why Front Wheel Drive?Here's Why: By taking our ultimate Fat Bike and adding our Front Wheel Drive Electric System we feel we have designed a ONE OF A KIND E-Bike.Most Electric Bikes are either rear wheel drive mid - drive, rear system.  This puts all the torque on the rear and as anyone who has ever driven through soft terrain like sand, snow, mud or over obstacles like curbs, stairs or logs, would know front wheel drive torque performs better.With the motor in the front, you can go through any terrain. Also, with others rear torque systems, at top speed, in soft terrain, when you attempt to turn you easily could dig the wheel in and cause a dangerous situation.With our E-Bike, you just power through those turns. And by adding a little pedal power you have an ALL-WHEEL DRIVE  E-BIKE  that will cycle through any terrain and over it almost anything!Choose from the sleek E-Grizzly with matte black frame and fork and yellow neon rims or are game stalker E-Cherokee with camouflage frame, fork and rims. Both electric bikes are available with a 750 Watt, 36 Volt E-Bike system for speeds up to 20 mph or the 1000 Watt, 48 Volt E-Bike system with speeds up to 25 mph which is for off road use only.
Why Ride a Fat Tire E-Bike?
If you are a commuter, looking to protect the environment, or just a person looking to save money on  gas, then this e bike is for you. You can easily get around town, avoid traffic jams and enjoy the outdoors on our Electric Bikes.
Other great uses for our fat E-Bikes are for hunters, or a rider looking to go places they have only been able to get to on foot before, or someone that’s just up for some xtreme riding.
Xtreme’s Fat E-Bikes will get you there!


What makes Xtreme’s eBike so much
better than the rest?
Our Safety Features:
Our Braking System:
We only use Avid Disc Rotors and Calipers and we use a 180mm
rotor on both the Front and Rear for maximum stopping power.
Our eBike Motor:
Our motor only works with your
thumb on the throttle; it shuts off automatically when you release it.
Our Tires:
Our Fat Tires are the widest width available which provides stability and superior
stopping power.
Most other Fat Tire E-Bikes utilize either Center or Rear
Wheel Drive Systems. This not only is a Safety Factor in Loose or Soft Terrain
but, it also prohibits their ability to move through loose terrain or over
obstacles.
The Rear Wheel Drive System is proven to turn poorly in Soft
Terrain and can be hard to maneuver which can be dangerous at high speeds in
soft terrain such as snow, grass or sand.
The Center Wheel Drive Systems can become unstable on
uneven terrains and negotiating obstacles and have far more difficulty in
climbing obstacles compared to the ALL-Wheel Drive System.
We have designed the first ever ALL-WHEEL Drive for
SUPERIOR SAFETY and BEST for getting through most any terrain, and over
obstacles!
Our
Copyrighted Skull Tire with its’ 5” width is made of Puncture-Resistant Rubber and is currently the WIDEST FAT TIRE
being  manufactured.



This tire is not only the coolest out there, but is very functional as
well with its Center Bead. 
You can Ride on only 10mm of
tire when on hard surfaces and with 5” of width you have the widest tire made
for soft terrain. This tire works with 5 PSI to 30 PSI, so it can be flattened
out for very Soft Terrain and add pressure to 30 PSI for the road. This tire
with its large air capacity acts just like a Shock for Jumps and Rough Terrain.
Electric Bike Battery:
Our batteries are made by Greenway, one of the
top Battery Manufacturers is Asia. It uses a separate Water Bottle
Mount that is not part of the battery like most other companies use and can be
easily removed without having to take off any wires from the battery. This
battery has a sealed shell that is completely Water
Proof with its own built in
voltage meter to tell if it needs a charge or not. Plus it has a neat carrying
handle attached to it for Easy Removal  to
carry for security or take with you to charge. This comes either as a 36 Volt or
48 Volt system and uses only the best Lithium Ion Technology with Sony Cells.


Front Hub Electric Bike Motor:
Choose From: 750
Watt with 36 Volts for everyone, OR
1000 Watt with 48 Volts for Off Road Use Only for the
Xtreme Rider in You.
This allows you
to have a Fat E-Bike that can take you literally anywhere!


Rear Wheel System:
Rear Wheel is a Quick Release Hub
with a Shimano 11-36T Cassette and an 8-Speed Shimano Alivio Rear Derailleur.

Now add
these two great features together and here’s what you get:
The only Fat
Bike which is All-Wheel Drive on the Market. This Bike’s Drive System will
literally take you anywhere, over most any object, even upstairs and over logs
with ease.
In Addition:
Top Quality Sealed Bearings Components: Our E-Bikes are not only made for any Terrain but, also
any environment with its sealed Bearing Head Set, Bottom Bracket, and Hubs making it completely weather resistant.
All
Alloy Components: We
use all alloy parts and frame for additional weather resistance.

Front Hub Motors and Electric Systems:
750 Watt System: We use a Front Hub Motor which has an all Alloy sealed Shell. The 36V Battery which is Lithium Ion cells and its sealed case with handles is easy to remove and change.
1000 Watt System: (Off Road Only Version) We use the same Front Hub Motor but with 48 V Battery and both have a 22 AMP Sealed Control Unit mounted to the Seat Post.
**(Wattage is Calculated Volts X AMPS= Watts.  36V X 22 AMP= 792 Watts and 48V X 22 AMPS= 1052 Watts)**
All of our motors are Brushless and our parts, as well as, our cord plugs are water resistant.
Control Pad and Throttle:
Handle bar mounted, Control pad and Throttle
Our Bike has three Levels which are controlled by the Control Pad:
Low: For just cruising
Medium: For riding through and over most any obstacle or terrain.
High: For full torque and speed
Warranty and After Market Support:
Xtreme Fat Bikes uses the best Cycling and E-Components made. We Warranty the Frame and Fork System for Three Years and all of our E-Components are plug and play. So, even after our Six Month Warranty we can Replace any part separately and never have to replace the whole unit. Our Hub Motors slide out of their Shell and can be replaced as well, without ever having to Re-Lace a new Hub.

E-Bikes are not only being used for personal use but for commercial use as
rental units at beach and ski resorts. What better way to tour the country side
of a resort town than on a Fat Tire All Terrain E-Bike?
We
have recently sold several E-Bikes to a company that conducts cavern tours at
the Louisville Mega Cavern, a 100 acre set of caves system in Louisville,
Kentucky.
In
addition, we have received only positive feedback from everyone who has tested
and ridden our E-Bikes. They all agree that Front Wheel Drive combined with
peddling power allows them much more freedom to ride to places that they could
not go with a Rear Wheel Drive E-Bike.
What is the Difference between
the E-Cherokee and E-Grizzly? 

These
are the exact same E-Bike. The E-Cherokee is all Camouflage; the E-Grizzly is
Matte Black with Neon Yellow Rims. 
What is the Difference between
the 750 Watt and 1000 Watt E-Bike? 
Power
is the only difference between our 750 Watt and 1000 Watt Electric Bikes.


The 1000
Watt has more power which you can use to get a little more speed to about 25
MPH and climbing and riding over obstacles; the 750 Watt will reach speeds of
20 MPH and while it cycles over obstacles, it does have less climbing power.
How Do you get maximum Speed from your E-Bike?
Check and make sure that none of your brake pads are rubbing the tires. Also, be sure that your tires are inflated to 28 Ibs.


How Do I get a correct reading from my Spedometer?
Spedometers measure speed based on the diameter of tires. Most are not calibrated to proper settings. Make sure it is set at 29.5 tire diameter to ensure proper readings.

 How Far can you Travel
on a Charged Battery?
Both
the 750 Watt and the 1000 Watt Electric Bike can go around 20 Miles on hard
surface at top speed without any peddling. The distance will vary if you are on
soft terrain or going up hills as that takes more power.
If
you add peddling to your journey you can substantially increase the distance
you can travel on a fully charged battery.
How
Long Does it Take to Fully Charge the Battery?
A completely depleted battery takes approximately three hours to
charge.
How
Long Will the Battery Last?
The battery is rated to last 500 cycles. A cycle = depleting a battery
then fully charging it 500 times. So how long the battery last depends on how
much usage. Most batteries last a lot longer than 500 Cycles more like
1000-1500 Charges because, typically a battery is never completed depleted
prior to charging.
What
is Our Warranty with Our Electric Bikes?
We offer a one year manufacturer’s warranty on all parts except
the battery which is warrantied for six months. 

We also offer an extended warranty for an additional year to cover the
electrical components excluding the battery available for purchase at $150.00 
How Do We Let You Know What Size and Color E-Bike We Want?We will contact you at the end of the campaign to confirm the size and color of your E-Bike and email you an invoice confirming your specifications.

It seems that electric bikes are more of a high end product and we want to change that. And we can. With the help and contributions we will be able to produce an stylish affordable and practical e-bike.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>   We are looking for 50 000$ to fund our project. The money will be spent on acquiring parts and materials to construct the bicycle, pay for workshop and utilities. Importing parts is expensive and we calculate that it will take most of the funding. We just want to make the bike and ship it to our customers and backers as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>   VOLTERY is a Danish quality electric bicycle. It is simple yet versitile. We want for it to be affordable as to a high school student working in summer break, as to a university professor who is just tired of sitting in traffic jams in a city.</p><p>Beautiful in its simplicity is our motto.</p><p>   The bike itself is simple, it folds and fits in a trunk of a Mini, but you get enough power from 250/350W electric motor to last for around 50 km using a varied mode (except model VOLTERY 350 PEGS). Simple 3 speed internal gearbox allows bicycle to reach 25km/h - 32km/h  easily. Uphill or downhill is not a problem.</p><p>We are offering 3 types of running gear for VOLTERY:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>VOLTERY 250 WPA</strong> is a starter e-bike. If you want to have simple and reliable commute bicycle, this is for you. Not the most powerful of e-bikes, but will get you where needed. It is for people, who do not want to charge that often. The battery combined with motor has the most range. You lose some speed, but for city driving, going to and from work it is all you need.</li>
<li> <strong>VOLTERY 350 WPA</strong> is our most powerful version. Get all the speed you need from 350W motor and never be late for appointment. Good for hillier regions where you definitely will feel the advantage of more power to reach the peak. More power means less range, but the difference is not so big to change your biking habits. </li>
<li>
<strong>VOLTERY 350 PEGS</strong> is for the one who does not care about biking. If you just want to get there, use this option. No biking, no sweat. Just sit there and relax while controlling the speed on the handlebar. Least range of all, meant to be as a last mile transport. If you have some blocks from train station or parking garage to get to your work, this is the option for you. </li>

As we both are interested in success of VOLTERY, no obstacle is too big to overcome.</p><p>   We are in constant contact with parts manufacturers, to ensure best quality and most reasonable price, having contacts in shipping and delivery has helped us to lower the costs and time expenditure severely.

It seems that electric bikes are more of a high end product and we want to change that. And we can. With the help and contributions we will be able to produce an stylish affordable and practical e-bike.What We Need & What You Get   We are looking for 50 000$ to fund our project. The money will be spent on acquiring parts and materials to construct the bicycle, pay for workshop and utilities. Importing parts is expensive and we calculate that it will take most of the funding. We just want to make the bike and ship it to our customers and backers as soon as possible.The Impact   VOLTERY is a Danish quality electric bicycle. It is simple yet versitile. We want for it to be affordable as to a high school student working in summer break, as to a university professor who is just tired of sitting in traffic jams in a city.Beautiful in its simplicity is our motto.   The bike itself is simple, it folds and fits in a trunk of a Mini, but you get enough power from 250/350W electric motor to last for around 50 km using a varied mode (except model VOLTERY 350 PEGS). Simple 3 speed internal gearbox allows bicycle to reach 25km/h - 32km/h  easily. Uphill or downhill is not a problem.We are offering 3 types of running gear for VOLTERY:

VOLTERY 250 WPA is a starter e-bike. If you want to have simple and reliable commute bicycle, this is for you. Not the most powerful of e-bikes, but will get you where needed. It is for people, who do not want to charge that often. The battery combined with motor has the most range. You lose some speed, but for city driving, going to and from work it is all you need.
 VOLTERY 350 WPA is our most powerful version. Get all the speed you need from 350W motor and never be late for appointment. Good for hillier regions where you definitely will feel the advantage of more power to reach the peak. More power means less range, but the difference is not so big to change your biking habits. 

VOLTERY 350 PEGS is for the one who does not care about biking. If you just want to get there, use this option. No biking, no sweat. Just sit there and relax while controlling the speed on the handlebar. Least range of all, meant to be as a last mile transport. If you have some blocks from train station or parking garage to get to your work, this is the option for you. 
Risks & Challenges      Biggest risks consist of getting the right parts in the right condition, importing and delays in shipping are scary, but doing extensive research in manufacturers and suppliers will avoid most of the hurdles. As we both are interested in success of VOLTERY, no obstacle is too big to overcome.   We are in constant contact with parts manufacturers, to ensure best quality and most reasonable price, having contacts in shipping and delivery has helped us to lower the costs and time expenditure severely. If there is a delay at any point, we have enough experience to deal with it ensuring timely delivery to our customers.Other Ways You Can Help...   We understand that not everyone can contribute financially, but spreading the word can help a lot too.   We want to reach as big of an audience as possible to help us succeed, so please share and post about VOLTERY!Frequently asked questionsQ:The price is very low for an e-bike.

Los Angeles is one of the many cities in the world that faces a large amount of individuals that experience homelessness. To
help break the cycle of homelessness, The Skid Row Housing Trust (SRHT)
provides permanent supportive housing so that people who have experienced
homelessness and prolonged extreme poverty can lead safe and stable lives in
wellness.
Imagine the
freedom of hopping on a bike, riding down the street, and getting where you need to go. That’s just the feeling we want to share with the residents of the SRHT buildings,
as they transition from the challenges of living on the streets to making
positive strides towards their new way of living. We want to help in a significant
way and we need your help! Help us build “The Trust Bike.”


Rotelli Cyclery (RC) is a
small independent bike shop located in
Downtown Los Angeles with a big idea. RC occasionally donates a bike to fundraisers, but
this time RC wants to donate over 200
bikes to the SRHT residents. But we need your help! Our goal is to be able to donate these 200
bikes to create a bike-sharing program within
26 of the SRHT residential
buildings. We truly feel that we can change many lives in a positive just by simply giving them bikes. If you’re
someone that loves riding bikes and/or
helping people in need, we think you’re really going to

How will it work?
This goal is a big undertaking for any company, especially a new small business. Your donation in any amount will help RC get 'Give a Bike - Change a Life' off and rolling.

After this campaign is launched RC will be able to continue the program without future funding. Once all 26 buildings have bicycles, we will then give the equivalent in cash donations.

For every bike bought at Rotelli Cyclery, we will donate a Trust Bike to the SRHT. In this first phase, the goal is to sell and give away 200 bikes.

Donate a

After countless iterations and road tests, our passion has grown up with us and became a unique part of our daily urban transportation. We want to share our passion with you.  Now everyday commuters, students, families and city dwellers can ""breeze"" through town and go places in a fun new way on their stylish skateboard.Inspired by race cars and adapted from principles of leverage, Elos is the only design which can provide stability even in high speed AND can handle sharp turns easily. Elos is a one of the kind skateboard. The patent-pending deck design provides a solid and stable platform to learn on. With a couple of quick tips, most people could learn how to ride in 5 min. Most kids don’t even need tips to start. Designed for quick stop and go. Whether you are waiting for the red light or grabbing that quick pizza, Elos provides a quick and easy solution.  Love your skateboard? We do too. Your Elos will come with a unique QR code for one click customer support and to help connect your skateboard back if it's lost.The design of Elos is inspired by the same principles that goes into race car design. The super wide deck works like a large steering wheel which gives you control into every angle of your turn. The leverage effect makes parts work seamlessly for tight turns and to stay stable while cruising in high speed. Who said one has to compromise performance with size?Inspired by racecar design: Low center of gravity means stability and legendary controlling.Elos is designed with quality to last a long time. Most skateboards are often damaged at the nose and tail. With solid metal protection at the nose and the tail, Elos will last much longer compared to traditional skateboards.Trucks are protecting Elos deck from head to toe.Regular grip tape (sandpaper) on skateboards will wear your shoes out, scratch up your cloth and can make your hands rough. We replaced the grip tape with a foot anchor to increase traction and to provide tactile feedback.Foot anchors provide you with tactical feedback.Elos was originally designed and created for loved ones. Thus we only use premium parts that we have trusted for years. The board is made of top-grade American hard maple that is processed in California. We hand assemble Elos and make sure each one is up to our standards before shipping.  Special thank you to our friends and families who support us with unconditionally love:

<p>But only for a limited time. Don't wait, be a part of the luxury eBike movement and contribute now. Be the first to ride by on alloy wheels, suspended on dual shocks, leaving a light trail from built in LED lights, all with a flick of a wrist. The Falctron already comes with plenty of luxury features, built right in to it's beautiful, sleek design.</p>
<span style=""text-align: center;""><h4>The money you contribute will be used<br/> to integrate innovation.</h4></span>
<p>This means continually upgrading our products with built-in luxury features, paying attention to users' needs, and all the while maintaining an affordable price. The falctron has amazing features already, Built in LEDs, front and back shocks and disc breaks, to name a few. But we want to keep improving. For example, one of our perks will give you a cell phone holder. But we want to incoporate the cellphone holder into the Falctrons design. Functionality is important to us but we also understand user experience is a must.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1424048/files/20150428173436-FalctronFeatures.png?1430267676"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>

<h4>Twist to Start</h4>The most ergonomical and safe method to command the motor: twist the left handle bar to accelerate.

<h4>Matte Black Crane Design</h4> The Falctron gets its name from the synergy of a Falcon and an Electron. The electron because, well, electricity, but the Falcon symbolizes the beauty, elegance, and fierceness of the eBike.

</table></div>","Falctron by EcoBikez is the first LUXURY eBike selling at under $1000!
But only for a limited time. Don't wait, be a part of the luxury eBike movement and contribute now. Be the first to ride by on alloy wheels, suspended on dual shocks, leaving a light trail from built in LED lights, all with a flick of a wrist. The Falctron already comes with plenty of luxury features, built right in to it's beautiful, sleek design.
The money you contribute will be used to integrate innovation.
This means continually upgrading our products with built-in luxury features, paying attention to users' needs, and all the while maintaining an affordable price. The falctron has amazing features already, Built in LEDs, front and back shocks and disc breaks, to name a few. But we want to keep improving. For example, one of our perks will give you a cell phone holder. But we want to incoporate the cellphone holder into the Falctrons design. Functionality is important to us but we also understand user experience is a must.
Our stretch goals outline our plans to elevate the Falctron. But before you jump ahead, check out what makes the Falctron by EcoBikez already the best electric bike.







Front suspensionThe Falctron supports preload adjustments and lockouts. There is a switch on the handle bar that will allow you to set the front suspension according to your weight and lock it in for a customized ride.






Back Air ShocksAn Air shock in the rear will ensure your body isnt feeling every bump, crack, or pothole on the streets. This gives the Falctron a truly unique position as it is the only eBike at this price with rear air shocks.






Air PumpThe Falctron comes with a complimentary pump for the air shock. This will ensure you maintain your flight, or well you know, a smooth ride. 




6 SpeedSwitch between 6 speeds for increased control. You don't have to always use electric motor, and when you don't, switching gears will help leverage your pedalling.




Alloy WheelsThe only ebike under $1000 with an Alumninum alloy rims. These rims will provide a durable ride, while maintaining a light weight.




Disc BreaksYour safety is always important, and having both front and back wheels come with disc breaks is another assurance of just that. Disc breaks dont wear down like traditional breaks. This will give you a safer ride for greater mileage.




Removable MudguardsStay protected with front and back mud guards. Never again have to wash your clothes because of spray back from the tires. And the Falctron's mudguards are integrated into its style to maintain the sleek ebike look.




Removable BatteryEasily remove your battery to charge or swap out for another. It even has a lock to ensure security. The battery only takes about 5 hours to charge. And if you forget to unplug after the battery is full, it is protected from overcharging and reducing life span. However, we recommend never to keep it plugged in over 24 hours. As well, it works with both 110/220V.




Built-in Back LightsSafety is important to us, and the Falctron comes with a built-in tail light. The light is designed to compliment the Falctrons body; it is not an accessory but instead, a standard. 




Front LED LightsA brilliant LED light will illuminate your ride and ensure people will see you coming. The light is powered by the battery and controlled by switches on the handle for ease of access.




LCD DisplayMonitor your battery life, speed (in km or miles), current mode, and even total kilometers. That's right, the Falctron comes with an Odometer and trip. The LCD Display is backlit and is controlled with buttons on the handle bar. 






Custom Max SpeedEasily set a custom max speed. This will ensure you dont accelerate past the legal speed limit in your city. After all, Falctron default max speed of 40kmh is pretty fast for an eBike.




Twist to StartThe most ergonomical and safe method to command the motor: twist the left handle bar to accelerate. But dont worry, Only when the key is in the battery, and the power switch is turned on, will the twist function work. You can even turn off the bike while your riding to save battery juice for when you really need it. 






Kick-Stand Even our kickstand is not your standard kickstand. An additional peice at the bottom gives an elegant look and provides a thicker base to ensure the bike is held up securely. You can also adjust the height of the kickstand.








Matte Black Crane Design The Falctron gets its name from the synergy of a Falcon and an Electron. The electron because, well, electricity, but the Falcon symbolizes the beauty, elegance, and fierceness of the eBike. And if you squint one eye when looking at the Falctron, the frame does look like a Falcon, although technically a Crane Design.

<li>
<strong>Sun&amp;Fun </strong>This model is more for recreation and not meant to be ridden at night. We left out the Dual LED Projection Headlights to help bring the cost down. But this bike is no sloth, it comes with one of the largest motors on the market, a 500w rated 8Fun motor. As well as a 500WH battery. Not to forget our signature stylish good looking Unibody-Rack, folding frame and Road Safety features such as turn signals and brake lights.</li>
<li>
<strong>24/7 </strong>As the name implies, you can ride it all day long. Our Dual LED Projection Headlights will make sure you can see and be seen on the road. We think this will be more like your combo play toy/work horse so we also gave it a bigger battery, 620WH. Enough for those long commutes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rapt </strong>Is for the enthusiasts who demand the best and the most. We have the largest mid-drive motor on the market at 750W, built for us by 8Fun, a trusted name in ebike circle. It is as quiet and as reliable as they come.</li>
</ul><p><br/><strong>What is so unique about the Dual LED Projection Headlights?</strong><br/>We believe we’re the only bike manufacturer with this feature. LED headlights are quite bright, but most of them just don’t deliver the punch for longer throws. And if you were to try and tilt them up to light up the road farther ahead, they’ll blind on-coming traffic. Our Dual LED Projection Headlights are everything that they are not.<br/> </p><ul>
<li>We use only market leading CREE LED to ensure light output and longevity. Our LED is rated for over 1000lm and over 30000 hours of service life. You have to see it to believe it, but you can actually see the lights they cast under sunlight.</li>
<li>Now all that power will be wasted if you cannot put them where you need them. We put a beam projector lens over the Cree LED so you can cast the light up to 30’ ahead of you and still make a difference.</li>
<li>Angel Eyes look cool like the headlights of a luxury car. These halos cast a glow on the rider, so drivers or other traffic can see you as a human being riding a bike, even on lightless streets.</li>
</ul><p><br/><strong>What range can you get from the battery?</strong><br/>We have 3 ranges of battery with our bike. They are all 48V to give you more efficiency and the maximum power you need when you want it.</p><ul>
<li>10AH-(500WH) battery will take you around *30 miles on one charge of battery power alone. If you use the pedal assist you can in effect stretch the range to almost 50 miles.</li>
<li>13AH (620WH) battery will take you 40 miles on battery alone and 65 miles respectively</li>
<li>17AH (800WH) battery can take you almost 50 miles on battery alone and 85 miles with PAS.</li>
</ul><p>*Based on 170lb rider on a flat paved road @ a constant &lt;15mph speed. These are rough figures so your actual mileage will vary, of course.<br/><br/><strong>Will I fit on the bike?</strong><br/>The seat height is engineered to be 33"" high at its lowest setting, and it’s adjustable, so it fits riders from 5’2"" to 6’4"". The frame is rated for a 220lb rider.<br/>​<br/><strong>Whats up with that wobble in the Electric Bike Review video?</strong><br/>A few of our backers have seen the video review of the MOAR Bike up on EBR. In his excellent and educational review, Court Rye brought up a troubling speed wobble issue. Our team in LA immediately looked into the problem, and the fix was very simple.</p><p>The bike tested in the EBR video is a hand-made prototype that has been used in hundreds of miles of testing and video shoots. Our team found play and motion between the fork and the headtube. We tightened all the screws holding everything together, and the wobble disappeared.</p><p>We have engineered our frame to be ISO4210/mtn bike certified, and are preparing to perform these tests soon. We'll have updates for everyone as we progress.<br/><br/><strong>Is there a warranty?</strong><br/>We use only quality components on our bikes to ensure our bikes last a long time. And we do offer a One (1) Year Limited Warranty on all our new bikes. We guarantee you will receive your MOAR ebikes free of manufacturing defects. In the unlikely case that a part breaks because of defects within the first year, we will ship replacement parts free of charge to you. Note this does not apply to rider incurred damages or normal wear and tear.<br/><br/><strong>Where can my bikes be serviced?</strong><br/>Besides our innovations, MOAR bikes have a lot in common with any other bikes and ebikes. If it’s an electrical problem, your best bet is to go to an ebike shop. If it’s a mechanical issue, like the derailleur or disc brakes needing to be adjusted or tuned-up, then it’s even easier - any bike shop can do it.<br/><br/><strong>What other colors do you have?</strong><br/>Our starting colors will be pearl white and matte black. We hope to incorporate a stretch goal for more colors.<br/>Our aluminum frame allows us to created anodized colors, same as what you find on your iPhone and MacBooks. We are the first company who can make it happen with something as large as a bike. Keep an eye out for stretch goals announcing additional color availability.<br/><br/><strong>How do you charge the battery and how long does it take?</strong><br/>The battery charges in about 4-5 hours using our included charger. You can do this while it’s on the bike or if it’s easier, take it out and charge it at home or in your office.<br/><br/><strong>Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world?</strong><br/>The charger is designed for dual 120-240V voltage, you might need a plug converter but it works anywhere you go.<br/><br/><strong>How do I choose between Rear Hub Drive and Mid-Drive?</strong><br/>A rear hub drive is way simpler in terms of operating and maintenance. In a way, you might think of it as an automatic gear shift vs a manual gear shift. With a rear hub drive, you don’t have to worry about what gear you are in when you start up your bike. With a mid-drive motor, you will need to keep track of what gear you are in, though you do have even more control over the bike’s behavior.</p><p><br/><strong>Is there a water bottle mount?</strong><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><strong>Can you remove the wheels if you need to put it in a car?</strong><br/>All our bikes fold into half for easy transportation and storage. We do have a quick release on the front wheel for Sun&amp;Fun and 24/7, which are rear hub driven, and quick releases for both wheels on the Rapt.<br/><br/><strong>How does the folding work?</strong><br/>It’s very simple, first you lift a safety thumb catch and then you release the rugged locking latch. The bike then folds smoothly in half. It’s best if you leave the kickstand down when you do this because of the weight shift.<br/><br/><strong>Will this comply with the laws in Europe/Australia?</strong><br/>This bike qualifies as an ebike without requiring a driver’s license in the US when it’s speed is limited to 20mph. Our Euro model is limited to 250W and a 15mph top-speed as required by EU countries or Australia.<br/><br/><strong>What’s the top speed of the Bike?</strong><br/>Our bikes can easily hit 25mph on battery power alone. Due to US laws we place a speed limiter at 20mph. The speed limit can be easily adjusted on the digital LCD display if you don’t plan to use it on legal roads.<br/><br/><strong>Do I need to wear a helmet?</strong><br/>Depends on local laws. We do suggest wearing a helmet at all times for your safety.<br/><br/><strong>How much is shipping?</strong><br/>Shipping and handling is $195 for shipments to the US, and $225 for international shipments.<br/><br/><strong>Can I pick the bike up and avoid the shipping charge?</strong><br/>The shipping charge includes shipping from our overseas manufacturing base, logistics and handling, so unfortunately we cannot accommodate this request.<br/><br/><strong>Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT?</strong><br/>You are responsible for any local, sales or import tax, please check your country's import duties before purchasing. There is currently no import tax for the US, but it varies internationally. <strong><a href=""http://www.dutycalculator.com/hs-code-duty-rate-import-restrictions/871190/electric-bicycle/8711.90.0000/8711.90.9000/2027/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Here is a handy link to a comprehensive list.</a></strong><br/><br/><strong>When is the bike shipping?</strong><br/>We are prepping for pre-production check and final tooling adjustments.

This motor boasts higher efficiency than our previous 750W offering, at over 80%. It is quieter, at <55DB, and .3kg lighter. It boasts cutting edge torque sensing, and is IP65 dust, splash, and rainproof. Top Speed is normally limited to 20MPH to comply with legal regulations, but when you’re riding in unregulated areas such as off-road trails, you can unlock the full, 30MPH top speed with a few button presses on your LCD screen! Get your Rapt II now!  MOAR is powered by either a 500w rear-hub or a 750w mid-drive motor.Our motors are not just designed for 10-15 seconds of ""peak power"",  meaning you can ride all day at 750w without burning up the motor. We estimate peak power for the mid-drive motor would roughly be in the 1,000-1,200w range. 750W Mid-Drive Electric Bike MotorOur silent 750w rated mid-drive motor drives the chain directly through its Shimano 9 speed gears, giving riders more precision control over their riding.Available on the ""Rapt"" model for $1,999​ At 118ft-lb (160NM) of max torque, our 750w mid-drive motor can tow a SUV from a standstill and has more than enough power to conquer even the steepest hills.  500w Rear Hub Electric Bike MotorOur silent 500w rated 8Fun rear hub geared motor easily tackles steep hills with 44ft-lb (60NM) of max torque and comes in either a 7 or 8 speed gear setup.Available on the ""Sun & Fun"" model for $999 and ""24/7"" model for $1,199 Top speed is capped at 20 mph to comply with regulations; however, press a few buttons on the LCD screen to unlock max speeds of 28 mph (mid-drive motor) and 25 mph (rear-hub motor) for off-road riding only. 9 Mosfet Motor ControllerMost electric bikes use a 6 Mosfet, with MOAR eBike we've opted to use a minimum of 9 Mosfet (higher the better) in our motor controllers.The motor controller and level of Mosfet ensure a smooth and responsive delivery of maximum electrical power to our 500w and 700w motors. This ensures you get the maximum torque and power that these 8FUN premium rated motors can handle and exactly at the moment you want it.  All electronics are powered by one 48V battery with either 10, 13 or 17AH.All batteries on MOAR Electric Bikes are made using premium 48V Samsung Li-Ion batteries (same as Tesla uses) which provides faster and more efficient power delivery with 30% more range than the standard 36V cells used by other eBikes.  48V Electric Bike Battery RangeEstimated range for a 176lb (80kg) rider cruising on flat ground at 15 mph on a MOAR eBike for each battery option:

10AH = 30 miles electric only, 50 miles level one pedal assist.

13AH = 40 miles electric only, 65 miles level one pedal assist.

17AH = 50 miles electric only, 85 miles level one pedal assist.
 One Concealed, Removable BatteryNot only does the rear rack add functionality, it conceals the removable battery.The 48V battery is housed in an IP65 splash-proof aluminum casing allowing it to easily slide in/out to charge away from your MOAR eBike.With only one battery powering everything from the motor to electronics packages, there's no forgetting to charge your headlights and no extra wires or mounts.  Each MOAR eBike comes complete with 7, 8, or 9 speed gears made by Shimano.Our premium ""Rapt"" model ebike with the 750w mid-drive comes with the 9 speed Shimano gear system, the ""24/7"" 500w rear-hub motor model comes with 8 speeds, and the ""Sun & Fun"" is equipped with a 7 speed.With our premium gear systems you'll get more control over your ride while increasing efficiency.   Most ebikes use ""speed sensors"" to calibrate PAS as you pedal, we opted to use ""torque sensors"" for more precise control.With a Pedal Assistance System you set a power level for and the electric bike motors will provide assistance in proportion to your pedaling, assisting you to maintain speed.With our Pedal Assistance System you can tailor trim your riding style with the tap of a button on the control panel located on your handle bars. Pedal Assistance Handlebar LCD ScreenMOAR ebike has 5 levels of assistance within the PAS, ranging from economy mode to sporty mode which is controlled by the conveneient LCD control panel.The Pedal Assist System will allow you to:

Exercise - Get a workout by setting PAS to off or low assistance like on a traditional bike.

Range - Easily double your distance covered by using PAS and eliminate range anxiety.

Terrain - Tackle tough hills or mountains by increasing the PAS to full or all-electric power.
 Torque Sensor vs. Speed SensorA premium electric bike uses a torque sensor instead of a speed sensor for PAS allowing it to measure how hard you are pushing on the pedals. The torque sensors measures the pressure on the crank to deliver the precise amount of assistance to you when you need it. For example, if you are riding on a trail and need to climb a steep slope, the MOAR PAS knows you are pedaling harder and provides more power based on your selection of our 5 levels of PAS.The torque sensor is available on the ""Rapt"" and ""24/7"" models while a cadence sensor is used on the ""Sun & Fun"" model. SAFETY FIRST WITH MOAR EBIKE.Riding is fun but safety is paramount, so we equipped MOAR with premium electronics and a few extras to keep the fun going. MOAR motors have the power to go fast so we knew we had to provide the power to stop you even faster and opted for the stopping power of Tektro disc brakes.MOAR electric bikes come equipped with either hydraulic assisted (premium) or mechanical 160mm rotor disc brakes (standard) made by Tektro USA that allow you to stop on a dime, all while triggering the automatic motor cutoff and rear brake light.Tektro hydraulic assisted disk brakes are available on the ""Rapt"" and ""24/7"" models while the mechanical are standard on the ""Sun & Fun"" model.  One battery to power them all: motor, lights, horn & USB port.Unlike most eBikes with aftermarket electronics, all MOAR safety components are centralized to the rear rack battery that powers the motor, so you'll never be put at a risk by running out of battery on a safety component while riding. 1,000 Lumen Projection HeadlightsMOAR's dual LED projection headlights were designed to be bright while not blinding oncoming traffic at night.These powerful Cree T6 dual LED projection headlights each shine a path of light of 1,000 lumens for up to 30 feet in front of you and each is rated at 30,000 hours of service life.With the Angel Eye glow ring (like on newer Audi's or BMW's) you'll get a soft glow on the road directly in front of you while also illuminating the road ahead. Brake Lights, Turn Signals & HornWe've added extra safety features even though they're not required by law.The brakes light glows automatically whenever the disc brakes are applied, with the turn signals and horn activated via handlebar.​AN INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED EBIKE.MOAR is created with you in mind, designing it to be practical, compact, versatile, comfortable, all-terrain & easy on the eyes.  Easily fold the MOAR eBike to half its size for storage and transport with one flip of the safety catch and a pull a latch.For added equipment safety, MOAR is the only electric bike on the market with a right-handed fold, allowing the front wheel to form a protective cage around the rear derailleur during transport.Look closely at the photo above with MOAR in the car trunk and you'll note the folding pedals that allow even easier transport. To further compact MOAR, simply pull on the quick release to easily remove the front wheel. MOAR is the only folding, full suspension, fat-tire eBike on the market. ALL MOAR ebikes are equipped with both REAR and front suspensions, which are only available on super premium bikes and for good reason:  you have to design and build your own suspension.Full suspension not only complements the fat tire by improving the ride and handling, we consider it a must for a bike that will routinely travel around 20mph because of:
Body & Bike Fatigue - Full suspension reduces the wear and tear on your body and the bike itself by softening jolts and reducing fatigue on your hands, legs, joints and rear, even if you bike standing up.
Ride Comfort - It's fairly obvious but full suspension makes for a more enjoyable ride at higher speeds. Don't believe us? Take a spin on one without full-suspension and you'll see what we mean.
Ride Handling - Rear suspension helps tremendously with traction on the ground and lets you keep control of your bike at higher speed.
 Our own patented designed rack is one of the features that turns MOAR into a pragmatic daily commuter and errand runner.A unique sturdy rack that is part of the bike frame, independent from the rear suspension and is welded to the frame as part of the design language of the bike, creating a strong statement and extending the exciting lines of the frame.It also conveniently allows you to carry saddle bags for computers, briefcase, groceries and other things. Handily, the rear rack houses and hides our removable lithium battery. All MOAR frames are heat treated 6061 aircraft grade aluminum alloy, making them rugged, lightweight and rust free.By design, the standover height is 30.5 inches, the seat height is engineered to be 33"" high at it’s lowest setting and it’s adjustable, so it fits riders from 5’2"" to 6’4"" with the aluminum frame rated for a 220lb rider. Moar bikes weigh around 60lb without the battery. Each battery adds:
10AH battery: 9 lb
13AH battery: 9.5lb
17AH battery: 11 lb
 The overall dimensions are as follows:Unfolded:

 An ebike traditionally has a lot of wires, so where are MOAR's?MOAR designed the electrical systems so all wires are housed internally within the frame for safety, waterproofing and overall appeal.Further, exposed electrical wires are wrapped in a protective sheath for added protection. All MOAR bikes are equipped w backlit-LCD control panels convienently located on the handle bar.The display provides the following information: battery level indicator, power consumption meter, speedometer, odometer and allows for PAS (Pedal Assistance System) control. As a bonus, you'll never have a low smartphone battery...We've added a USB Port to keep you charged throughout your ride. THREE MOAR EBIKE MODELSAn all-in-one solution for the weekend warrior, the daily commuter and/or the eBike enthusiast:

Not just a bicycle with a motor slapped on, but in a category by itself, somewhere between a bike and a scooter or motorcycle.We started as eBike enthusiasts trying to create a bike that we wanted to ride. We were excited by the power and speed, but we realized while riding our own prototypes over hundreds of miles that we can’t really use these bikes every day!We wanted an eBike that would have somewhere to put our groceries. A bike that would make its presence known in traffic, that would help us see at night without blinding other drivers. A bike with one battery powering everything.The result is the MOAR Bike. We think it’s a good first step.   How did you think of your model names?We wanted to get straight to the point and have some fun with the names of our bikes. 

Sun&Fun This model is more for recreation and not meant to be ridden at night. We left out the Dual LED Projection Headlights to help bring the cost down. But this bike is no sloth, it comes with one of the largest motors on the market, a 500w rated 8Fun motor. As well as a 500WH battery. Not to forget our signature stylish good looking Unibody-Rack, folding frame and Road Safety features such as turn signals and brake lights.

24/7 As the name implies, you can ride it all day long. Our Dual LED Projection Headlights will make sure you can see and be seen on the road. We think this will be more like your combo play toy/work horse so we also gave it a bigger battery, 620WH. Enough for those long commutes.

Rapt Is for the enthusiasts who demand the best and the most. We have the largest mid-drive motor on the market at 750W, built for us by 8Fun, a trusted name in ebike circle. It is as quiet and as reliable as they come.
What is so unique about the Dual LED Projection Headlights?We believe we’re the only bike manufacturer with this feature. LED headlights are quite bright, but most of them just don’t deliver the punch for longer throws. And if you were to try and tilt them up to light up the road farther ahead, they’ll blind on-coming traffic. Our Dual LED Projection Headlights are everything that they are not. 
We use only market leading CREE LED to ensure light output and longevity. Our LED is rated for over 1000lm and over 30000 hours of service life. You have to see it to believe it, but you can actually see the lights they cast under sunlight.
Now all that power will be wasted if you cannot put them where you need them. We put a beam projector lens over the Cree LED so you can cast the light up to 30’ ahead of you and still make a difference.
Angel Eyes look cool like the headlights of a luxury car. These halos cast a glow on the rider, so drivers or other traffic can see you as a human being riding a bike, even on lightless streets.
What range can you get from the battery?We have 3 ranges of battery with our bike. They are all 48V to give you more efficiency and the maximum power you need when you want it.
10AH-(500WH) battery will take you around *30 miles on one charge of battery power alone. If you use the pedal assist you can in effect stretch the range to almost 50 miles.
13AH (620WH) battery will take you 40 miles on battery alone and 65 miles respectively
17AH (800WH) battery can take you almost 50 miles on battery alone and 85 miles with PAS.
*Based on 170lb rider on a flat paved road @ a constant <15mph speed. These are rough figures so your actual mileage will vary, of course.Will I fit on the bike?The seat height is engineered to be 33"" high at its lowest setting, and it’s adjustable, so it fits riders from 5’2"" to 6’4"". The frame is rated for a 220lb rider.​Whats up with that wobble in the Electric Bike Review video?A few of our backers have seen the video review of the MOAR Bike up on EBR. In his excellent and educational review, Court Rye brought up a troubling speed wobble issue. Our team in LA immediately looked into the problem, and the fix was very simple.The bike tested in the EBR video is a hand-made prototype that has been used in hundreds of miles of testing and video shoots. Our team found play and motion between the fork and the headtube. We tightened all the screws holding everything together, and the wobble disappeared.We have engineered our frame to be ISO4210/mtn bike certified, and are preparing to perform these tests soon. We'll have updates for everyone as we progress.Is there a warranty?We use only quality components on our bikes to ensure our bikes last a long time. And we do offer a One (1) Year Limited Warranty on all our new bikes. We guarantee you will receive your MOAR ebikes free of manufacturing defects. In the unlikely case that a part breaks because of defects within the first year, we will ship replacement parts free of charge to you. Note this does not apply to rider incurred damages or normal wear and tear.Where can my bikes be serviced?Besides our innovations, MOAR bikes have a lot in common with any other bikes and ebikes. If it’s an electrical problem, your best bet is to go to an ebike shop. If it’s a mechanical issue, like the derailleur or disc brakes needing to be adjusted or tuned-up, then it’s even easier - any bike shop can do it.What other colors do you have?Our starting colors will be pearl white and matte black. We hope to incorporate a stretch goal for more colors.Our aluminum frame allows us to created anodized colors, same as what you find on your iPhone and MacBooks. We are the first company who can make it happen with something as large as a bike. Keep an eye out for stretch goals announcing additional color availability.How do you charge the battery and how long does it take?The battery charges in about 4-5 hours using our included charger. You can do this while it’s on the bike or if it’s easier, take it out and charge it at home or in your office.Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world?The charger is designed for dual 120-240V voltage, you might need a plug converter but it works anywhere you go.How do I choose between Rear Hub Drive and Mid-Drive?A rear hub drive is way simpler in terms of operating and maintenance. In a way, you might think of it as an automatic gear shift vs a manual gear shift. With a rear hub drive, you don’t have to worry about what gear you are in when you start up your bike. With a mid-drive motor, you will need to keep track of what gear you are in, though you do have even more control over the bike’s behavior.Is there a water bottle mount?Yes.Can you remove the wheels if you need to put it in a car?All our bikes fold into half for easy transportation and storage. We do have a quick release on the front wheel for Sun&Fun and 24/7, which are rear hub driven, and quick releases for both wheels on the Rapt.How does the folding work?It’s very simple, first you lift a safety thumb catch and then you release the rugged locking latch. The bike then folds smoothly in half. It’s best if you leave the kickstand down when you do this because of the weight shift.Will this comply with the laws in Europe/Australia?This bike qualifies as an ebike without requiring a driver’s license in the US when it’s speed is limited to 20mph. Our Euro model is limited to 250W and a 15mph top-speed as required by EU countries or Australia.What’s the top speed of the Bike?Our bikes can easily hit 25mph on battery power alone. Due to US laws we place a speed limiter at 20mph. The speed limit can be easily adjusted on the digital LCD display if you don’t plan to use it on legal roads.Do I need to wear a helmet?Depends on local laws. We do suggest wearing a helmet at all times for your safety.How much is shipping?Shipping and handling is $195 for shipments to the US, and $225 for international shipments.Can I pick the bike up and avoid the shipping charge?The shipping charge includes shipping from our overseas manufacturing base, logistics and handling, so unfortunately we cannot accommodate this request.Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT?You are responsible for any local, sales or import tax, please check your country's import duties before purchasing. There is currently no import tax for the US, but it varies internationally. Here is a handy link to a comprehensive list.When is the bike shipping?We are prepping for pre-production check and final tooling adjustments. We shall ship our first batch in April.Can I get a refund?Please refer to IndieGoGo's policy here.Can I change or cancel my perk?Some perks are easier to change than others, generally It’s easier to upgrade your perks.

The engine is very quiet. The workmanship and quality of the entire bike is impeccable. I ride a normal bike with 500 watts and don't notice any noticeable difference in performance compared to THE ONE. <br/>Conclusion: I definitely recommend purchasing this bike!""</i></p>

Good News to all new Supporters here, we have THE ONE in all our warehouses worldwide in stock. Currently we can serve all orders within shortest time!! ❤️
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
At United City Bikes we have developed a bike that takes urban mobility to the next level!
THE ONE is not just another electric folding bike. We have created the ultimate experience for riders by making an electric bike that is light, compact, durable, flexible and affordable. At only 12.5 kg, THE ONE is currently the lightest folding electric bike on the market. It contains more than 20 patents, is only 25 cm wide when folded, folds in less than 10 seconds and boasts many more cool features!
 
/ World’s Lightest Electric Folding Bike /






 
/ Lightweight Magnesium Alloy Frame /

What makes our electric folding bike so light? 
THE ONE's signature and smart design is due to its superior patented magnesium alloy frame. This frame weighs 35% less than other premium aluminum frames on the market.
Our custom-built, 250W high speed hub motor weighs 65% of a conventional motor, at only 2 kg. High quality materials, like our state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery cells, and our single-sided fork technology contribute towards this innovate design and its light weight of only 12.5 kg!
 
/ Leading Folding Process /


THE ONE’s folding technology is the best on the market.
THE ONE’s folding mechanism is quick and easy, making it perfect for everyday use! Foldable in less than 10 seconds to a compact width of just 25 cm, and makes it ideal for your go-to choice for your commute (folded dimensions: 25 x 64 x 76.5 cm).
Its compact size is made possible because of its single-sided fork technology and a patented magnetic system that makes the two wheels stick tightly and firmly together. Compact and sturdy when folded, THE ONE can be conveniently carried, just like a briefcase!


 

 
 
/  Charge It Anywhere In 3.5h (up to 52km) /

Where is the battery?
Batteries aren't something you need to see - except when you’re charging them. On THE ONE, we've integrated the battery into the seatpost to retain its slim frame design. Charging stations aren't prevalent yet, and we wanted to make sure that you have the option to charge the battery without having to carry your bike up those stairs. 
Simply remove the seatpost to take out the battery for charging, whether in your apartment or at your office. We use state-of-the-art battery cells from well-known manufacturers like Samsung and Panasonic. Take THE ONE out for a ride of up to 52 km (32.93 miles) on only one charge!

 
 
 
/ High Performance Motor /

 
Customized for highest standards
THE ONE has a 250-watt customized high speed, brushless motor that allows for a high energy conversion rate of 95%. This translates to a 30% higher performance compared to a conventional motor. Greater efficiency means riding longer distances and less battery energy consumption!
The U.S. version is equipped with a Power Assist System (PAS) and a thumb throttle for straight electronic mode. In pedal assisted mode the US version reaches a max. speed of approximately 32 km/h. The EU version comes with a pedal assisted mode only (max. speed of 25 km/h or 15.5 mph) to comply with European safety legislations. Travel further and faster! This e-bike is for commuters and cyclists of all fitness levels.
 
/ Smart And Modern Urban Design /

The new urban look
The minimal look is made possible with the gear drive system and the battery integrated in its body and the seat post respectively. The top-quality patented framework of the bike gives the bike a unique sleek look as well as a tough body with a maximum load of 125 kg (275 lbs). All the wires have been neatly tucked away inside the framework making this also water and weather resistant. The patented convenient built-in bracing foot system keeps the bike standing on its own.

“Overall, I like the design best. ‘THE ONE’ is perfect for helping me stay on time for my professional assignments, making those last 2 kilometers to an appointment or to the office a breeze. Also, I like that I can use it for any small bike trips. For me, ‘THE ONE’ is a definite recommendation.”
 

Alexander Parent
“My favorite features of ‘THE ONE’ are its low weight and superfast folding mechanisms. The bicycle is particularly suitable for public transportation thanks to it being so small and convenient. I’ll definitely be getting one for myself”
 

Helmut Gall
""My impression of THE ONE was overwhelming. It really knocked me off my saddle.I am convinced that THE ONE is an absolute top product. The performance of the engine is remarkable. The engine is very quiet. The workmanship and quality of the entire bike is impeccable. I ride a normal bike with 500 watts and don't notice any noticeable difference in performance compared to THE ONE. Conclusion: I definitely recommend purchasing this bike!""

In weniger als 10 Sekunden faltbar auf eine kompakte Tiefe von nur 25 cm. Eben ideal für Pendler, die flexibel die vorhandenen Fortbewegungsmittelder Großstadt nutzen möchten. Das Faltmaß beträgt: 25 x 64 x 76,5 cm.Die kompakte Größe wird durch die einarmige Gabeltechnik und ein patentiertes Magnetsystem ermöglicht, das die beiden Räder fest zusammenhält. Im zusammengeklappten Zustand ist THE ONE kompakt und robust und kann wie eine Aktentasche bequem getragen werden!  / Überall Aufladen in nur 3,5 Std. (bis zu 52 km Reichweite) /Wo ist die Batterie?Akkus muss man nicht unbedingt sehen – außer beim Aufladen. THE ONE hat die Batterie in der Sattelstütze integriert, damit das schlanke Rahmendesign beibehalten werden kann. Ladestationen sind noch nicht weit verbreitet, und darum wollten wir sicherstellen, dass Du die Möglichkeit hast, die Batterie aufzuladen, wo immer Du möchtest und ohne Dein Fahrrad zum Beispiel die Treppe hinauftragen zu müssen.Entferne  einfach die Sattelstütze, um die Batterie zum Laden herauszunehmen, egal ob in Deiner Wohnung oder in Deinem Büro.

Dies entspricht einer um 30% höheren Leistung im Vergleich zu einem herkömmlichen Motor. Höhere Effizienz bedeutet längere Strecken und weniger Energieverbrauch für die Batterie!Die US-Version ist mit einem Power Assist System (PAS) und einem Daumengas für den dauerhaften elektronischen Modus ausgestattet. Im pedalunterstützen Modus erreicht die US Version eine Höchstgeschwindigkeit von ca. 32km/h. Die EU-Version verfügt über einen pedalunterstützten Modus (Höchstgeschwindigkeit 25 km/h), um den europäischen Sicherheitsvorschriften zu entsprechen.

Wir haben uns dazu entschlossen ein Prdoukt zu entwickeln, welches für die Massenproduktion bereit ist, bevor wir die Crowdfundingkampagne gestartet haben. Damit wollen wir Produktionsfehler vermeiden, um Unterstützer des Projektes nicht Monate lang auf ihre Produkte warten zu lassen. THE ONE ist fertig entwickelt, zertifiziert und eine kleine Produktion hat bereits begonnen. Die Massenproduktion startet bald.Wie viel kostet der Versand?Der Versand kostet $99, da wir THE ONE direkt aus Asien liefern. Das ist auch der Grund dafür, warum wir THE ONE für so einen günstigen Preis anbieten können, weil es keine Vermittler zwischen Käufer und Produktionsstätte gibt.
 Wer ist verantwortlich für Einfuhrsteuern, Zoll etc.?Der Unterstützer des Projektes trägt diese Kosten. Bitte überprüfe daher vor dem Kauf mögliche Einfuhrsteuern, Zoll etc. Diese müssen vor dem Versand von THE ONE bezahlt werden, damit die Lieferung erfolgen kann. Wir senden dir Links zum Kauf, eine Rechnung und Fragen nach deiner finalen Versandadresse, bevor wir dir THE ONE zusenden.

<p><b>ADVERPRIZE (Patent Pending)</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Steven Campbell, I have a
BSME from Texas Tech and have been designing products for over 25 years.<span>  I currently live in Las Vegas and have worked
in the casino/hospitality industry for 15+ years all over the world.  During this time I have designed products
ranging from SCUBA, TV’s, medical devices, aerospace, slot machines, In-Room
Gaming, etc.  I currently have 6 patents
with many more going through the process. 
I enjoy hearing people explain their ideas and turning them into reality.</span></p>
<p>While traveling I noticed that I
don’t know much about where I am and what to do.<span>  Going to a concierge is not convenient
because you need to leave the room.  You
turn on the TV and it has an advertisement channel, but that is boring to watch
and you quickly turn it off.  Not fun and
no impulse involved.  That is when
AdverPrize was born, allowing you to play a game on the TV and win a prize,
children or adults.  </span></p>
<p>AdverPrize is a hospitality
marketing system.<span>  Currently people at a
hotel have money but don’t know much about entertainment or places to eat.  With AdverPrize, a customer plays a game and
wins a discount coupon. These discount
coupons in the game are set up by the hotel and can be changed at any
time.  It works on an impulse principle
by giving you a choice, which they pick, and a reason to go there.  Everybody likes to win and everybody likes to
get deals; AdverPrize does both.  The
hotel gets you to one of their locations to open your wallet, and you get a
deal to open that wallet – everybody wins at the end.  </span></p>
<p>Contributors will be taking
AdverPrize from a single test sight to a worldwide product.<span>  I have used my own funds as well as friends and
family to get to the test sight phase and now have locations interested and waiting
on a delivery schedule.  Contributors
will allow the most important step to happen, from a single location to
worldwide use.  </span></p>
<p>The test run was a success using
AdverPrize.<span>  The hotels were happy with a
new revenue stream, amenities were happy with new customers, and the customers
were happy with getting a deal on entertainment, restaurants, and whatever was
being played for.  <b>AdverPrize – Everybody Wins</b>.</span></p>
<p>Without your help, AdverPrize may
never happen.  </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT AdverPrize is asking for and
WHY:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>AdverPrize is looking for <b>YOUR</b> help to get across the finish
line; jump on board and let’s make it happen.<span> 
Here is a breakdown of what is needed to win the race.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Looking for $15,000.00, used for the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>Building the black boxes installed in the hotels to
      run the software.<span>  AdverPrize is a
      web based system, but the hotels want their database information internal
      to the hotel so we run as an intranet system.</span>
</li>
<li>Booth at Hitec (Los Angeles) in June, 2014 and G2E
      (Las Vegas) in September, 2014.<span> 
      Attend and see what your helped make.</span>
</li>
<li>Finalizing all Patents</li>
</ul>
<li>AdverPrize will be installed worldwide, so you are contributing
     to a worldwide product.<span>  When you
     walk into a hotel and turn on the TV, you are part of that screen
     everybody sees.  Only people that
     jump on board will have their name forever on the website and also on a
     background collage.  When people
     talk about playing AdverPrize, you will be able to show that you helped
     make it happen.</span>
</li>
<li>If funds do not reach the entire goal, we may have to cut
     back on both hospitality shows.<span>  We
     can also ramp up at a smaller pace and once revenue starts, build more
     black boxes for new locations.</span>
</li>
</ul><p>Without your help, AdverPrize may
never happen.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Why should you contribute to
AdverPrize?<span>  You can change the way that
hotels market products to their guests.

<p></p></div>","ADVERPRIZE (Patent Pending)

My name is Steven Campbell, I have a
BSME from Texas Tech and have been designing products for over 25 years.  I currently live in Las Vegas and have worked
in the casino/hospitality industry for 15+ years all over the world.  During this time I have designed products
ranging from SCUBA, TV’s, medical devices, aerospace, slot machines, In-Room
Gaming, etc.  I currently have 6 patents
with many more going through the process. 
I enjoy hearing people explain their ideas and turning them into reality.
While traveling I noticed that I
don’t know much about where I am and what to do.  Going to a concierge is not convenient
because you need to leave the room.  You
turn on the TV and it has an advertisement channel, but that is boring to watch
and you quickly turn it off.  Not fun and
no impulse involved.  That is when
AdverPrize was born, allowing you to play a game on the TV and win a prize,
children or adults.  
AdverPrize is a hospitality
marketing system.  Currently people at a
hotel have money but don’t know much about entertainment or places to eat.  With AdverPrize, a customer plays a game and
wins a discount coupon. These discount
coupons in the game are set up by the hotel and can be changed at any
time.  It works on an impulse principle
by giving you a choice, which they pick, and a reason to go there.  Everybody likes to win and everybody likes to
get deals; AdverPrize does both.  The
hotel gets you to one of their locations to open your wallet, and you get a
deal to open that wallet – everybody wins at the end.  
Contributors will be taking
AdverPrize from a single test sight to a worldwide product.  I have used my own funds as well as friends and
family to get to the test sight phase and now have locations interested and waiting
on a delivery schedule.  Contributors
will allow the most important step to happen, from a single location to
worldwide use.  
The test run was a success using
AdverPrize.  The hotels were happy with a
new revenue stream, amenities were happy with new customers, and the customers
were happy with getting a deal on entertainment, restaurants, and whatever was
being played for.  AdverPrize – Everybody Wins.
Without your help, AdverPrize may
never happen.  
WHAT AdverPrize is asking for and
WHY:

AdverPrize is looking for YOUR help to get across the finish
line; jump on board and let’s make it happen. 
Here is a breakdown of what is needed to win the race.

Looking for $15,000.00, used for the following:

Building the black boxes installed in the hotels to
      run the software.  AdverPrize is a
      web based system, but the hotels want their database information internal
      to the hotel so we run as an intranet system.

Booth at Hitec (Los Angeles) in June, 2014 and G2E
      (Las Vegas) in September, 2014. 
      Attend and see what your helped make.

Finalizing all Patents

AdverPrize will be installed worldwide, so you are contributing
     to a worldwide product.  When you
     walk into a hotel and turn on the TV, you are part of that screen
     everybody sees.  Only people that
     jump on board will have their name forever on the website and also on a
     background collage.  When people
     talk about playing AdverPrize, you will be able to show that you helped
     make it happen.

If funds do not reach the entire goal, we may have to cut
     back on both hospitality shows.  We
     can also ramp up at a smaller pace and once revenue starts, build more
     black boxes for new locations.

Without your help, AdverPrize may
never happen.
The Impact

Why should you contribute to
AdverPrize?  You can change the way that
hotels market products to their guests. 
Hotels have coupons they give away, you can get them on the internet,
mail, or in a newspaper or magazine. 
With AdverPrize the customer turns on a TV or mobile device and gets
impulse ideas on what to do.  You, as a
contributor, get to say that you helped with the birth of this new industry.  
I have a successful track record with
projects being successful in the marketplace, as well as being ahead of the
game in coming up with ideas before their time. 
As an example, I started working on mobile casino gaming in early 2000,
which is now becoming a reality in casinos around the world.  AdverPrize will be that next revolution and
you can help.
AdverPrize can also be used on home
TV’s and mobile devices.
Other Ways You Can Help
I know that in today’s economy some
people can’t contribute with money.  But
you can put the word out for AdverPrize and if you find somebody that can
contribute we can reward you in some fashion. 

When you are at a hotel, tell them
about AdverPrize
Ask people to get the word out and make some noise
     about your campaign.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><i><strong>How can I replace the battery inside BitLock?</strong></i>  To replace the battery, you must first unlock BitLock and remove the U-shaped shackle. Then use a screwdriver to unscrew the cap at the end of the internal compartment, slide the battery out, insert a new battery, and screw the cap back on. For more information see <u><a href=""https://bitlock.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/231962928-How-do-I-replace-the-battery-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</u></p></li>
<li><p><i><strong>How long does the battery last on BitLock?</strong></i> With intelligent power management, advanced battery technology, low power radio and actuation system, BitLock can perform close to 10,000 lock/unlock operations on a single battery. This is enough to provide a near 2-year battery life under average usage (5 lock/unlock operations per day) before replacing the battery.

Features

Keyless 
Say goodbye to keys. Never again worry about losing your key, searching for them in your purse, pocket, or on your key ring. 

Share Access
Share the location and access to your bike with friends and family. With BitLock, you can create and set up your own bike share system.

Geo-tagging
BitLock app remembers your bike location under the hood as you lock/unlock your bike using your phone GPS. This way you will never forget the last parked location of your bike.

Long battery life
With an ingenious design, intelligent power management, advanced battery technology, low power radio and actuation system, BitLock can perform 10,000 lock/unlock operations on a single battery. This is enough to provide a more than 2 year battery life. The battery used in BitLock can be easily replaced with a new battery afterwards.

Weather resistant
BitLock is designed to withstand inclement weather conditions. The internal components are sealed and weatherproofed inside a plastic compartment. The electronics and battery can also operate under an extended temperature range.

Secure
BitLock uses encryption found in online banking systems, so bike thieves are better off going after banks than to mess with your bike. BitLock is made of reinforced and heat-treated steel combined with a high security disc locking mechanism and a bent shackle foot design.

iPhone and Android
BitLock app can run on both iPhone and Android. iPhones models after iPhone 4 running iOS 8+ as well as Android phones running KitKit 4.4 and more recent Android versions are supported.

Performance Test Results
Pull Test

BitLock has gone through extensive pull test and can withstand a pull force of close to 5000 pounds (2.2 tons). 
Salt Spray Test

BitLock body and U-bar are zinc plated to withstand corrosion. The standard test for corrosion is called Salt Spray test. Every 24 hours of salt stray test is equivalent (very roughly) to a year of being out in the field. The test was performed for 144 hours with no visible red corrosion.  
Test result:  0% of rust or red corrosion was observed.
Surface finish: zinc plate.
zinc layer thickness: 3.5um to 4um.
Test period: 144 Hours
Test date: 2015-2-2  to  2015-2-9
Weather Proof Test
BitLock was immersed under the water at 30cm depth for 30 minutes for water intrusion test. BitLock is no supposed to be immersed under water under normal usage and this test was only to push the limits on water intrusion test.

We want as many people to try our electric board and share their experiences and thoughts with us and the community at large.  We'll be releasing contest details very shortly, but the winner will become an official TeamGee ambassador and free board tester. That means if you win you’ll receive every new board we make for free to test for the rest of your life!Now you can buy this board on our website: www.teamgee.com TeamGee H9 Board DesignThe final TeamGee H9 board design features Drop-Through Trucks and 90mm Black Wheels. Thanks to Daniel Kwan’s review of the TeamGee you can see the final look of the board (minus the blue transparent wheels). Meaning the board our backers will receive will look just like this one but will feature 90mm Black Wheels!  TeamGee is a revolutionary electric longboard designed to be as lightweight as possible. Weighing just 13 lbs, it provides all the features of competing electric boards without any of the extra bulk. Fulfill your need for speed with TeamGee. Built with 2 different speed modes allowing you to get comfortable on the board before gunning it at the 23 mph top speed. Switch between the modes with the click of a button on your handheld ergonomic remote.Feel the wind in your hair and freedom beneath your feet as you cruise along a top speed of 23 mph. Powered by silent dual 380w In-Wheel Hub Motors, TeamGee has a range of 11 miles and will get you where you’re going, fast. And you’ll never spend too long with a dead battery thanks to TeamGee’s 2 hour 0-100% recharge time. Team Gee is built with an advanced battery bank that is as thin as the deck itself and built right into it. This gives you a sleek electric board while safely protecting the battery from weather and damage. So there’s no more bulky battery packs you have to worry about damaging or getting wet, just a lean, powerful board beneath your feet. Designed to accommodate any level of rider, from the timid amateur to the adrenaline seeking veteran, Teamgee is the easiest electric longboard to jump on and start cruising.Thanks to its integrated battery and shorter trucks the TeamGee sit closer to the ground resulting in a lower centre of gravity for better rider balance and easier turning or carving. So you can take it downhill  or on the tightest turns and it'll handle just like a regular longboard.With its intuitive ergonomic remote the TeamGee is easy to control. Its acceleration and braking respond quickly allowing you to find the perfect speed and slow down right when you need to.   The TeamGee ergonomic remote control is unlike any other. Featuring a digital display and intuitive design, it will not only allow you to control your board perfectly but will keep you informed about your speed, battery levels, and direction of your TeamGee electric longboard. The remote is even outfitted with a LED flashlight to help you see in in the dark. TeamGee is made to endure the trials of the road. The deck is made of 11-Ply Canadian Maple and Carbon Fiber, giving it a strong durability but also allowing it to bend and flex like a regular longboard. This design also allows the integrated battery cells to stay protected and bend with the board. The In-Wheel Hub Motors TeamGee arrives are 90mm PU wheels which give you less drag, last longer, weigh less, offer better brakes, and provide you with a silent ride (there is no extraneous sound like you’ll notice on belt-driven systems).You’ll also be able to kick push the TeamGee if you find yourself out of battery. The In-Wheel Hub Motors also have regenerative braking meaning when you are going downhill or slowing down you’re recharging your battery.And the motors are powerful enough to take you up hills as steep as 20° so you won’t have to push against gravity.  ​ Share Our Campaign To Get A Free Sheet of Black Grip Tape

<p><strong>What is the invention?</strong></p>
<p>I am the proud inventor of ABES (Algae Based Emission System). </p>
<p>The ABES is an anti-pollutant device that fits into the exhaust of any motor vehicle (or potentially an industrial plant) and reduces emissions through the photosynthesis of algae, acid/base reactions, and a variety of other neutralizing species. The device is founded on concepts of environmental engineering and complexities of bio-active processes in high heat and pressure.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>MyKIDis.com is a rising social network site for Parents who love to Brag about their kids.  </li>
<li>We understand that in order to change the world, we must start with our children.  My Kid Is, wants to give an avenue for children all across the globe to receive pride and praise for their accomplishments by the people that matter the most to them.</li>
<li>Our goal is to have as many people participate in the beta site to complete development based on your feedback of user experience prior to releasing worldwide.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are a funded project on it's own.  Our goal is to raise awareness of what we are doing, gain quality users who want to beta test and supply feedback based on this monumental project, have funds going to great charity sharing our mission of helping children, and receive great promotional perks!</p>
<p>Perks include bumper stickers, t-shirts, hats, and more to come.  50% of ALL funds raised will be donald to Ronald McDonald House Charities!</p>
<p>         <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/82158039.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The funding goal is $8,000 for the benefit of Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Florida - <a href=""http://www.ShareANight.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ShareANight.org</a></p>
<p><em> ""While there is no charge to stay at theRonald Houses in Orlando and the cost exceeds $60 nightly, a suggested $15 per night assists with child a need.  Should a family not be able to contribute, they still have a place to stay in close proximity to the hospital.  It amazes me that such a small contribution can make a huge difference in the lives of children and their families during their most vulnerable moments of their life.  We are grateful that Ronald McDonald House is allowing us to assist in making a difference in these children's lives, starting in our backyard, right here in Orlando.""</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Louis Shain, CoFounder, myKIDis.com</strong><br/></em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My Kid Is personal to me.  I have a personal goal each day to see how many people I can make smile.  In doing so, I realized the most rewarding and innocent smile is that of a child.</p>
<p>Our goal is to faciliate as many children around the world to smile!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Whether or not you have children, I am sure you are very close to people that do.  This rising social networking site revolves around bragging about children and praising their accomplishments.  It fosters self esteem and gives parents, friends, and relatives a way to show how proud they are of the children in their lives.  You can support this venture with as little as $1.00 or by simply sharing it with others.  As a proud parent myself, I know this will touch the lives of many and would love as many of you as possible to be able to be a part of it.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>My 3 Biggest Supporters</h3>
<div>With my belief in what I'm doing, I have been working 15+ hours daily for the last three months.  It really home, when my 6 year old sophisticatedly asked, ""Dad, when you SORT out myKIDis, will you be able to spend more time with us?"".   </div>
<p>That broke my heart, here I was trying to empower children worldwide, yet severely neglecting my own in the process.</p>
<p><br/>My Kid Is, is my gift to them (and you) to share with the world!</p>

<h3><strong><em><br/></em>Procceeds Benefiting Ronald McDonald House Charities!<br/></strong></h3>
<p>When Lauren at Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Florida heard about our story.  She asked if my children would join Mr. O, their dog, with a couple friends for a tour around one of the houses.  My kids have been so excited and sharing it at school.  It tears me that such a small act of kindness can make them so happy.  Ronald McDonald House Charities did that for my children and I want to make just as large of an impact for them.</p>

</h2></div>","Short Summary

MyKIDis.com is a rising social network site for Parents who love to Brag about their kids.  
We understand that in order to change the world, we must start with our children.  My Kid Is, wants to give an avenue for children all across the globe to receive pride and praise for their accomplishments by the people that matter the most to them.
Our goal is to have as many people participate in the beta site to complete development based on your feedback of user experience prior to releasing worldwide.



What We Need & What You Get
We are a funded project on it's own.  Our goal is to raise awareness of what we are doing, gain quality users who want to beta test and supply feedback based on this monumental project, have funds going to great charity sharing our mission of helping children, and receive great promotional perks!
Perks include bumper stickers, t-shirts, hats, and more to come.  50% of ALL funds raised will be donald to Ronald McDonald House Charities!
         
The funding goal is $8,000 for the benefit of Ronald McDonald House Charities of Central Florida - www.ShareANight.org
 ""While there is no charge to stay at theRonald Houses in Orlando and the cost exceeds $60 nightly, a suggested $15 per night assists with child a need.  Should a family not be able to contribute, they still have a place to stay in close proximity to the hospital.  It amazes me that such a small contribution can make a huge difference in the lives of children and their families during their most vulnerable moments of their life.  We are grateful that Ronald McDonald House is allowing us to assist in making a difference in these children's lives, starting in our backyard, right here in Orlando.""
Louis Shain, CoFounder, myKIDis.com


The Impact
My Kid Is personal to me.  I have a personal goal each day to see how many people I can make smile.  In doing so, I realized the most rewarding and innocent smile is that of a child.
Our goal is to faciliate as many children around the world to smile!


Other Ways You Can Help
Whether or not you have children, I am sure you are very close to people that do.  This rising social networking site revolves around bragging about children and praising their accomplishments.  It fosters self esteem and gives parents, friends, and relatives a way to show how proud they are of the children in their lives.  You can support this venture with as little as $1.00 or by simply sharing it with others.  As a proud parent myself, I know this will touch the lives of many and would love as many of you as possible to be able to be a part of it.
 
My 3 Biggest Supporters
With my belief in what I'm doing, I have been working 15+ hours daily for the last three months.  It really home, when my 6 year old sophisticatedly asked, ""Dad, when you SORT out myKIDis, will you be able to spend more time with us?"".   
That broke my heart, here I was trying to empower children worldwide, yet severely neglecting my own in the process.
My Kid Is, is my gift to them (and you) to share with the world!

<p>Whether young or old, we all depend upon transportation to maintain a good quality of life in rural communities like Yankton. We recognize that there is a transportation gap within Yankton County, and we believe Liberty Mobility is the solution. Many citizens and organizations have identified dependable, 24/7 transportation options as a large problem in our community. Liberty Mobility offers a ride sharing service just like Lyft or Uber, but is also willing to partner with existing transportation providers like Yankton Transit and taxi companies to make sure all needs in the community are met. It is the glue that fills in the gaps.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What is Liberty Mobility? </h3>
<p>In a nutshell, Liberty Mobility is the Uber for rural communities. They connect people with transportation options through technology and public-private partnerships. Riders can hail a ride through a mobile app specially designed to operate in places with limited cell coverage or dialing a call center. Liberty Mobility rides are provided by contract drivers who are background checked, trained, insured, and have their vehicles inspected. The service is also able to coordinate with existing public transportation options, whether it is Yankton Transit or a private cab service. Here are just some of the reasons someone might obtain a ride through Liberty:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going to the doctor</li>
<li>Getting a ride for Dad or Mom to the grocery store</li>
<li>Headed to church</li>
<li>Your car is in the shop and you need to grab a ride to work</li>
<li>You need a lift home from a restaurant or bar</li>
<li>Your license has been revoked and you need transportation</li>
<li>Friends and family can use Liberty to make sure loved ones can travel to where they need to go safely – giving everyone the freedom to do what they need to do – without the burden of asking or changing schedules around. For example, you can schedule a ride for your elderly mother and track when she was picked up, the route taken to the destination and when she arrived</li>
<li>Organizations also work with Liberty to offer transportation options for their clients, patients, students or customers</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The board of Yankton Area Progressive Growth (YAPG), a non-profit economic development corporation, will consider entering an agreement with Liberty Mobility Tuesday that will bring the company to Yankton County. Our goal is to partner with YAPG to raise the $25,000 needed by Liberty Mobility to launch here. Together, we can revolutionize transportation in our area and have a ride-hailing service before larger cities in the region — like Sioux Falls! The funds go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first two months of a local Mobility Manager’s salary</li>
<li>The first two months of office space rental</li>
<li>Call Center Utilization</li>
<li>Marketing ‐ Social Media, Radio, &amp; Print</li>
<li>Driver Training for more than 40 drivers</li>
<li>Background Checks</li>
<li>VIN Inspection</li>
<li>Drug Testing</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ol>
<li>You’re creating jobs! One full-time employee and an anticipated 40 or more independent drivers would serve all the residents of Yankton County.</li>
<li>Rides are $5.25 for the first four miles and $1.00 per mile after that. You are charged by the ride, not the number of passengers. So, even if you have three riders, the price for the initial four miles is $5.25.</li>
<li>80% of the fare is paid to the driver and thus goes back into our community.</li>
<li>This will increase access to health care. Keys should not be required to utilize your medical benefits or get access to the doctor. Liberty Mobility provides transportation options that our current public transportation can not.</li>
<li>Connect those in need of social services, like United Way programming, Ability Building Services, and others.</li>
<li>It will give people the opportunity to enjoy the restaurant and entertainment options Yankton has to offer without the worry of how to drive to and from home. This potentially reduces DUI convictions and alcohol-related driving fatalities.</li>
<li>It offers a way to reduce the social isolation of our seniors who do not have access to transportation.</li>
<li>It complements current public transportation and taxis.</li>
<li>Liberty Mobility has a non-profit arm that would enable people in our community who want to volunteer to provide rides to connect with those who need that service.</li>
<li>This is a way Yankton County could be more hospitable to our tourists and visitors. It provides a way for people from the lake and hotels to visit our businesses.</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>Foreseeable Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to come together as a community to raise the funds to launch this service that provides a needed resource for people of all ages and improves the overall quality of life in Yankton County.</li>
<li>Ongoing sustainability depends upon usage. In order to see a return on our investment, we need to use Liberty Mobility!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Shark Wheel Technology</strong></p>
<p>1. Rough Terrain. The best wheel in the world over rough terrain. The sine wave shape tends to kick pebbles and small objects out of the way. Also the best wheel over wet conditions. </p>
<p>2. Approach Angle. Shark Wheels perform similar to how drivers intuitively know to go over a speed bump at an angle to reduce the shock in their car. The unique 30-degree approach angle of the Shark Wheel reduces shock and deflects objects. A normal wheel is a steamroller and tries to go over obstacles in its way. Shark Wheels tend to move around objects</p>
<p>3. Lasts Longer. Scientifically tested to last 15% longer when cruising. Shark Wheel has multiple center points compared to one center point on a traditional wheel. </p>
<p>4. Better Slide Control. The Shark Wheel actually spins as it slides acting like a car's antilock brakes. The 3 lips of the Shark Wheel compared to 1 lip on a traditional wheel give predictable slides. Also, slides are easier to perform due to less surface area in contact with the ground-less friction to initiate slide.</p>
<p>5. Lightning Fast. Less friction touching the ground, less rolling resistance. Up to 60% less friction depending on weight. </p>
<p><strong>Shred Lights Technology</strong></p>
<p>Seize the night with 400 lumens of brightness from the ShredLights SL-200 front and rear lights. These USB Rechargeable lights allow you to see up to 30 feet ahead and be seen from over 2,000 feet away by cars. Only 2 hours to charge, fully movable. From 25-50hrs normal use time. Order after the campaign at a <i>heavily </i>discounted price.</p>

<p>Movpak is an electric skateboard that folds into a backpack, for urban commuters. From the outside, it looks like a normal backpack, with zippers and pockets with enough space for all your daily needs, on your back.  However attached to the backpack, you’ll find your portable electric vehicle. By pulling a dedicated handle, the board effortlessly slides out, and using the small remote, you have full control of the speed and braking. To recharge, simply plug the charger into any standard outlet for two hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517431035/f3ihjw8hledmttyy8m69.jpg"" src=""""/></span></p>
<p>Commuters share the same challenges. They often deal with heavy traffic jams if by car, long walks to the train or bus if by public transportation, and of course carrying a bag or purse, to store their daily needs. This is why the Movpak is the best solution for the urban commuter. The backpack can carry everything you need, doubling as a personal electric vehicle capable of speeds up to 15 mph, and a range of 6 miles per charge. There are no fumes, no wires and no damage to the environment.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>For the most part we always know when we’ll need a backpack. We never know when we’ll need to get somewhere fast. It’s light enough to use as your go-to backpack and be ready for those rushed moments.</p>
<p>Movpak adds a clever backpack component so the whole thing folds up and away for when you need to dash down some subway steps or go inside a building for work.</p>

<p>Learning how to ride a Movpak is much easier than any other board sports. First, because it has motors, with brakes, that prevents the Movpak from sliding when you get on. Second and best, you can press your foot and calf against the rear part of the backpack. This will give you added support, stability and provide you more balance.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> <b>Is Movpak ok to travel on airlines?</b></strong></p>
<p>Yes! Movpak is also airport friendly by both fitting in most overhead compartments on commercial flights and also by meeting battery size limit restrictions for traveling with. The pull out handle makes rolling Movpak super easy and convenient. </p>
<p>We recommend you keep the packaging in case you want to ship your Movpak somewhere, or travel with it as checked luggage (never with batteries)!</p>
<p><strong><b>Does it have a brake?</b></strong></p>
<p>Yes! Just push the remote trigger backwards, and it will start braking. In fact, the brakes are regenerative, which mean that you will be recharging your battery each time you break.</p>
<p><strong><strong>I've never ridden a skateboard, snowboard, surfboard, or any kind of boards. Can I learn how to ride a Movpak?</strong></strong></p>
<p>Of course! Learning to ride a Movpak is actually much easier than all these board sports. First, because it has motors, with brakes, that prevents the Movpak from sliding when you get on. Second and best, you can press your foot and calf against the rear part of the backpack. This will give you added support, stability and provide you more balance. You can use your calf to make turns, just leaning forwards and backwards.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><b>Can I make skateboard tricks with it?</b></strong></p>
<p>We know how fun it is to ride, but we do not recommend this. Although it is very resistant and durable, the Movpak was designed to be a personal vehicle for transportation, not for extreme sports.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><b>What is the maximum rider weight?</b></strong></p>
<p>We suggest 240 lbs. However, the range, speed and hill climbing may vary according to the riders weight.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><b>Is the Movpak waterproof?</b></strong></p>
<p>The backpack is water repellent, and the motor is sealed. You can ride it in a light rain, and humid terrains, but never in heavy rain, with water on the pavement.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><b>What are the materials used to make a Movpak?</b></strong></p>
<p>Movpak was designed with the latest technology and materials, made from the same special aluminum used in the manufacturing of aircrafts and satellites.</p>
<p>We've chosen to use a lithium battery, a powerful brushless motor, all beautifully packaged on a light weight laminated deck that's constructed using a combination of wood, metal and Kevlar compounds allowing it to be strong and flexible at the same time.</p>
<p>We've redesigned the remote many times, again using the latest technologies, making it more appealing and comfortable, using simple one touch buttons for acceleration, braking and even one for reversing.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><b>Is the charger universal i.e, can be used in different countries where the voltage is different?</b></strong></p>
<p>Yes, Movpak's input voltage is 100-240v~50/60hz 2.0A. Although you may need an adaptor to fit your outlet since Movpak comes with American standard plug.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><b>What type of braking system does MOVPAK use?</b></strong></p>
<p>MOVPAK uses a regenerative braking system to help sustain the batteries charge.</p>
<p><strong><b>If the battery ends, can the owner use the skate as a regular one?</b></strong></p>
<p>6 miles is a long range. Research indicates that most of commuters are averaging about 3 <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">miles everyday going to work or school and back, so we thought that 6 miles would be more </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">than enough. Besides, you can always charge it in any regular outlet in just 2 hours or even get an extra easily swappable battery to double the range. So, that is why we didn't design this Movpak model for using it as a regular skateboard.</span></p>
<p><strong><b>Can we charge devices in the Movpak. How is that?</b></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! Movpak comes with a USB port so you can charge smartphones, tablets and other <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">gadgets. </span></p>
<p><strong><b>Isn't the backpack too heavy to carry?</b></strong></p>
<p>If you compare it with a regular backpack, then yes, it weighs 16lbs.

</div></div>","THE MOVPAK

Movpak is an electric skateboard that folds into a backpack, for urban commuters. From the outside, it looks like a normal backpack, with zippers and pockets with enough space for all your daily needs, on your back.  However attached to the backpack, you’ll find your portable electric vehicle. By pulling a dedicated handle, the board effortlessly slides out, and using the small remote, you have full control of the speed and braking. To recharge, simply plug the charger into any standard outlet for two hours.
 

Commuters share the same challenges. They often deal with heavy traffic jams if by car, long walks to the train or bus if by public transportation, and of course carrying a bag or purse, to store their daily needs. This is why the Movpak is the best solution for the urban commuter. The backpack can carry everything you need, doubling as a personal electric vehicle capable of speeds up to 15 mph, and a range of 6 miles per charge. There are no fumes, no wires and no damage to the environment.
 
PERFECT FOR COMMUTERS

Movpak the hybrid smart backpack and electric skateboard, is revolutionizing transportation in urban cities, empowering people to move through the world in a more efficient way. 
 
BACKPACK ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION

For the most part we always know when we’ll need a backpack. We never know when we’ll need to get somewhere fast. It’s light enough to use as your go-to backpack and be ready for those rushed moments.
Movpak adds a clever backpack component so the whole thing folds up and away for when you need to dash down some subway steps or go inside a building for work.
 
 UNFOLD AND GO!

Inside the backpack you'll find your portable vehicle. Simply pull a dedicated handle and the board effortlessly slides out. You have full control at your fingertips of the speed and braking system using the provided wireless remote.

GREAT FOR STUDENTS

 
RIDE UP TO FIFTEEN MILES PER HOUR

Movpak is a fast and reliable portable transportation. Compared with regular bicycles or other portable electric vehicles, it weighs less than half of most of them. If you compare to a foldable electric bike, Movpak is lighter, simpler to fold/unfold and has storage capacity. All the other electric vehicles you have to carry it with one hand while in the other you have a backpack. The average person is able to learn how to ride the Movpak in about 10 minutes.
 
SIX MILES RANGE WITH ONE CHARGE

 
MOVPAK CAN BE FULLY CHARGED IN ONLY TWO HOURS  

To recharge, just simply plug in the included charger into any standard outlet. It's that easy.

<p><strong>What about replacement wheels?</strong></p>
<div>The Elwing Board's durability has been tested and the wheels do not get damaged in a normal usage. All wheels will be available as spare parts on our website. The non-motorized wheels can be changed with any other standard 83mm wheels on the market. The motorized wheel will be available on our website as a spare parts. For mechanical safety and durability reasons, the motorized wheel is molded with the rotor. If you ever need to change the motorized wheel, you will be able to buy a new rotor with it.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Is the Elwing Board waterproof?</strong></p>
<div>The motor is fully waterproof. The whole board is splash-proof but not waterproof. Just like any skateboard, Elwing's bearings could also be damaged by water. We recommend you use your Elwing Board just like you'd use any regular skateboard.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>How much will it cost to replace batteries?</strong></p>
<div>The battery comes included with the board. Buying a spare battery will cost around $80.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Where can I get replacement parts?</strong></p>
<div>All replacement parts will be available on our online shop. All maintenance parts will be available through our customer service.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>What is the rider weight limit?</strong></p>
<div>We tested the hill limits (uphill climbing and downhill braking) and range using a 185 pound rider. Heavier riders will see a decrease in speed going uphill, but performance on flat ground won't change.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>What is the warranty?</strong></p>
<div>All board rewards will come with a one-year warranty on manufacturing defects from the day you receive it.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>What is the final retail price?</strong></p>
<div><p>The final MSRP is currently planned for $749, but depends on a lot of factors like distribution, retail options and final manufacturing costs and may go up.The difference in price between a reward board via Indiegogo and a retail model later will be significant.</p></div>
<p><strong>Can I swap for my own deck? Can I just get a kit?</strong></p>
<div>No. The deck is modified to fit exactly with the battery box and to have the exact right flex needed. Wheel wells have been designed to match with the wheels size to avoid any wheel bite, even during carving.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Can I push like a normal skateboard?</strong></p>
<div>Yes you can. The in-wheel motor generates almost no drag so it just feels like riding a regular skateboard (unlike most of other electric skateboards that have a drive belt which produces a lot of drag).</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Can I get more battery range?</strong></p>
<div>For now we do not offer extended battery range. However if you kick-push twice when every time you start riding, you can save up to 40% of the energy the motor will consume.</div>

</div></div>","ELWING BOARDSElwing is the world's most compact electric skateboard. Every detail has been designed based on the idea that commuting should be the fun and easy part of the day. The result is an extremely lightweight electric skateboard that holds a incredible amount of power. Elwing's performance is amazing : 18mph of top speed and 7 miles of range for only 9,9lbs. It takes only 45 minutes to charge with the fast charger. The in-wheel motor provides phenomenal gliding sensations and allows you to keep riding without using the motor.  Elwing packs a powerful motor within a small form factor so it's versatile enough for any situation while being light enough to hold with one finger.  FEATURED IN JOIN ELWING BOARDS TESTS FEEDBACK FACEBOOK GROUP

  Introducing LoopLoop is a minimal phone mount that sits discreetly on your bike's handlebars and is ready to use in seconds. It's totally different from anything else on the market and is perfect to help any cyclist get from A to B quickly and easily .     
The Problem We love to explore on our bikes and using a phone makes it quicker and easier than ever. But constantly checking directions in traffic is hassle and can be dangerous.   We've always loved the idea of a phone holder, but hated the way they look and work. We created Loop out of frustration with the existing solutions on the market - they're ugly, clunky to use or need accessories or phone cases just to work.   The SolutionWe created Loop from the ground up to be right for cycling. That means holding any size phone securely without ruining the look of your bike. We knew it needed to be quick and easy to use and that it shouldn't need any accessories to work.     We wanted to create something robust and beautifully engineered so started with an all-metal construction.   We've made Loop work with all major phones (including an iPhone 11 Pro Max) and all handlebars sizes (22.2mm to 31.8mm - that's 7/8"" to 1 1/4""). It will fit a lot of stems as well if they are close to round. Most importantly it's designed to look and feel like it's part of your bike.It's completely different from anything on the market - we've protected the design with a worldwide patent pending and extra protection in China (中国专利审查中) with Jiaquan IP.So what makes Loop different from everything else on the market?1. Engineered to hold your phone securelyLoop has been engineered to be secure enough on the bumpiest roads. We've designed it for strength from the start - incorporating industrial springs which clamp your phone in place.   Despite its strength - we wouldn't recommend it for off-road or extreme riding. 2. Quick and easy to use We wanted to make using Loop as quick and easy as jumping on your bike. So the interaction takes seconds - and requires absolutely no accessories.    3. Looks and feels like part of your bikeLoop is inspired by your handlebars - low profile and discreet. It's designed to look and feel like it's part of your bike, whatever type of cyclist you are.        4. Built to lastLoop made from CNC technology and it's all-metal construction is built to last.       5. Made for every bike & every phoneLoop is designed to fit small to large phones, every type of bike, and all major sizes of handlebars.        How we got here Sketching & Ideation CAD & Engineering  Development & PrototypingTesting  Next StepsLoop mount is fully designed, engineered and prototyped. We are looking for your support through kickstarter to help us pay for tooling, complete final testing and certification and produce the first batch of products.

<p>It is widely known that use of cell-phones and other electronics while driving is associated with higher rates of dangerous or fatal car crashes. In the United States, 10 states have banned the use of handheld cell phones while driving; several other states have placed a similar ban on novice drivers only. In Canada, all 10 provinces have some form of cell phone/distracted driving laws in place that include fines and licence demerit points. Despite the laws that have been put in place or the devastating statistics, many people continue to put the safety of themselves and others at risk. Rather than wait for each person to be affected personally by injury or tragedy, a solution that could change this behaviour is to provide a convenient and reliable alternative to using a handheld device while driving. <br/></p>

<p>Graffiti
Removal Services is a locally owned small business in Portland, Oregon. Our
service helps private residences, business owners, schools and cities fight the
never ending battle against graffiti in our communities using only the most
environmentally friendly products and methods of removal. </p>
<p>Most of the
removals that we do around the city require close access for one of our work
trucks with a pressure washer and other equipment mounted inside to effectively
remove the graffiti.<span>  Recently we have

<p>The 3 Wheel
Electric Bike will be a smaller, environmentally friendly, human powered version of our work trucks. The
electric assist and customizable flat-bed design will give us the power and
room that we need to carry all of the same products, tools and even a
mini-pressure washer that we use for graffiti removal on a larger scale in our
trucks.</p>
<p><strong>Electric
Motors</strong> </p>
<p>The bike
will have an electric hub motor for the best in power and durability allowing
for a maximum hauling capacity of up to 600lbs- enough to climb even the
steepest hills. The electric hub motor eliminates the need for a transmission,
cross axle and differential, resulting in weight savings and increased cargo
capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Front Wheel
Drive</strong> </p>
<p>The front
wheel drive pedal system features efficient power transfer with zero steering
pull.<span>  This system allows for high
maneuverability and enables each wheel to have its own power source.</span></p>
<p><strong>Steel Frame</strong></p>
<p>The bike
will be constructed with a hand-built tubular steel frame for the strength
needed to move 600lbs of cargo for a long time while only weighing in at a
standalone weight of 250lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Brakes</strong></p>
<p>Unlike
bicycle brakes, the motorcycle rear brakes used on the 3 wheel bike will use
large rotors and heavy-duty calipers engineered for increased safety and
stopping power even when hauling heavy loads. </p>
<p><strong>Cargo Box</strong></p>
<p>We will be
working with another locally owned company to fabricate a customized cargo box.<span>  In order to make the cargo box as light as
possible we plan to use reinforced welded aluminum with customized drawers,
winged doors, an exhaust vent for the mini-pressure washer and all of the
products and tools that will allow us to remove graffiti from any substrate.</span></p>

</div></div>","Graffiti
Removal Services is a locally owned small business in Portland, Oregon. Our
service helps private residences, business owners, schools and cities fight the
never ending battle against graffiti in our communities using only the most
environmentally friendly products and methods of removal. 
Most of the
removals that we do around the city require close access for one of our work
trucks with a pressure washer and other equipment mounted inside to effectively
remove the graffiti.  Recently we have
been challenged by our access to local public parks, bike paths and pedestrian
bridges and an increase in tagging in these areas.  Since our work trucks limit our access, we
are looking to evolve and adapt our removal methods in order to re-beautify our
neighborhoods.  
We are

It has batteries, electronics and a motor that touches the rear tire of the bike. It also has a wireless cadence sensor that tracks Your pedaling pattern and adapts the electric assist automatically. Its patented quick-release lock technology enables Rubbee to be installed and detached with one hand, in just one second. Make Your bike electric.We've prepared these rewards to our Indiegogo backers with heavy discounts from future retail price. These prices are only valid for our Indiegogo supporters. We have a long history of making electric drives for bicycles. All the way since our first Kickstarter campaign to today. We commit to deliver the Rubbee X in time for the next riding season.Combined, our team has over 40 years of experience in development and manufacturing of electric vehicles. We've worked on multiple hybrid electric trucks, charging stations, electric cars and, of course - Rubbee itself. So when it comes to engineering - we've got what it takes.We used to manufacture all the previous generation Rubbee units in our own assembly line in Lithuania. Now we're gearing up for a much larger scale of manufacturing. So from the very beginning we've developed Rubbee X in close partnership with a solid manufacturing partner. Hint - they employ over 2500 people. They are huge ! This ensures quality, smooth certification process and great after sales support.For the past year we've been working on our next-gen electronics, new motor, batteries and other new components of the Rubbee X. It's a product we've developed from the ground up with all our knowledge from the previous generations of it. We've built multiple prototypes along the way, here are some moments of our journey and a short video about how the earlier prototypes of Rubbee X works:

<p>To help communities share what's great about them- including the advertising wealth their social media content creates.</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b></p>
<p>Our team comes originally from the worlds of advertising, technology and charity. We started out 4 years ago to build a social sharing network that would re-distribute the advertising wealth that it's content creates.</p>
<p>As we've developed the network, and built and improved the technology over continuous iteration, we've improved many features- including how we give to charity.</p>
<p>Today, it's really the dream medium for charity giving.</p>
<p>Simply using it as a social network earns our charity partners money. Our software sees to it that for every 10 baaCoin we pay to our content generators (that's everyone posting) we pay another into a charity account.</p>
<p>Our users can also make additional donations either from the money their content earns on baagloo, or their own funds, or both, at any time. Simply use the charity selector.</p>
<p>Our goal on Indiegogo is to raise the funds to bring in additional tech and marketing and grow the network to the next level; and to get new users of the baagloo network on board. So please download the free iOS app here <a href=""http://t.co/5W6LXAMXAH"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://apple.co/1Iu8hUZ</a>  and/ or sign up on our website, <a href=""https://www.baagloo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.baagloo.com</a> </p>
<p>Now you're ready to baagloo!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get:</b><br/></p>
<p>baagloo is already really useful, beautiful and a force for good, and we've got a growing community of users.</p>
<p>We want baagloo always to be about our users, from our users and for our users.</p>
<p>So we think the best people to involve in our first ever crowd fund are our users.</p>
<p>We're looking to raise $35k to help us bring additional people on board and get us to the next level. All funds will be invested into additional features and services which will make it ultimately easier to use baagloo more often and generate more funds!</p>
<p>Your contributions and joining up will really make a difference and remember the more people on board the more funds we can generate for charity. So come on board and invite all your friends.</p>
<p>There are a whole lot of perks to choose from.</p>
<p>Being very passionate about what baagloo is already doing and what- with your help- we'll do more of, we've designed perks that allow you to get more involved in our plans and that make you a part of these long term.</p>
<p>There are therefore a lot of 'digital' perks that are based around our technology, where you can become an active part of baagloo.</p>
<p>There are also perks which are more 'physical', and celebrate the cool baagloo brand.</p>
<p>You can also combine these into 'packages'.</p>
<p>The Perks:</p>
<p><b>1. Charity Nomination:</b></p>
<p>Nominate any legal charity for inclusion into our TOP 100 charities board.</p>
<p>It's $10 per vote and you can vote as many times as you like.</p>
<p>We'll share your donation 50/50 with your chosen charity wether they make the top 100 or not.</p>
<p>Check the baagloo website for vote updates on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>The TOP 100 will remain in place for 6 months; meaning your chosen charity has continuous exposure over this period.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: when you select the perk via Indiegogo we'll create an account for you in baagloo using the same email, or using your existing baagloo account if you already have one, and credit your votes to your account.</p>
<p>And we'll email a you confirmation that your votes are in your account ready for you to use.</p>
<p>You simply use your votes on the charity section of the baagloo website.</p>
<p>It's that simple!</p>

The concept of providing safe family airport transportation is now a reality, due to the efforts of CEO Nelson Nigel, a lifelong entrepreneur and former NYC yellow taxi driver. Currently Kidmoto Technologies™ addresses the safe transportation safety needs of parents traveling to or from NYC airports and plans for national growth.  Kidmoto also provides Kidrent, which is an add-on service, providing parents the convenience of renting strollers and Pack N Play play areas while staying in NYC.--------------------------​ --------------------------",0.0,4,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Cantwell Lihanda. My friends call me Canty. I live in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</p>
<p>My Indiegogo campaign is a fundraiser to expand my work which helps people in extreme poverty. </p>
<p>Let me explain. </p>
<p>I am the African communications coordinator for PiF, a different kind of micro business creator. PiF provides small business grants to people living in areas of extreme poverty. The grants help people to become self-sustaining through the creation of small business like kiosk pharmacies, piggeries, internet cafes, grocery shops, small fishing enterprises, home-based sewing businesses and many more. </p>
<p>Instead of paying the grants back to a bank or loaning agency, the participants pay forward from their profits to people in their own social circles. This way, the profits are shared and keep growing exponentially.</p>
<p>You can find out more about PiF by going to <a href=""http://www.communitybuilders.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.communitybuilders.ca</a> and clicking on the Pay it Forward links.  </p>
<p>My work involves traveling to remote village areas in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi and DR Congo to coach and support people who want to help themselves by starting a small business after receiving a PiF grant. .  </p>
<p>When I am not travelling, I work out of my small home office in Dar es Salaam and this is where I need help.  </p>
<p>Let me explain more.</p>
<p>Everyone connected to PiF needs to be self-sufficient, even me, the communications coordinator. So far, Community Builders has spent $3,000 to train me and set me up in a home office in Dar es Salaam. But now I have to start a small business like all the other PiF participants and pay forward from my profits to people in extreme poverty. </p>
<p>My business will be called PiF Crowd Funding Support Services. It is a business to help micro business people in extreme poverty to raise funds to start businesses through Indiegogo and other social media websites.</p>
<p>My business will assist 20 PiF leaders in five sub-Saharan countries and many of the more than 500 PiF participants to use PiF and Indiegogo services, as well as other social media tools to raise funds for their small businesses. I will ask each person I help to pay me a small portion of the funds they raise to pay for my services. </p>
<p>In my business plan, the PiF leaders will raise a total of $20,000 over the next four months. I will ask for 10% of the funds raised, or $2,000. I will keep this approach going in the future and help to start more small businesses.</p>
<p>My own pay forward plan with the profits of my business is to help women and their families living in Bagamoyo, Tanzania. Most the families I want to reach out to have poor health and ragged clothes. They eat only one meal per day which is just a mixture of corn flour and vegetables.</p>
<p>I am partnering with a retired Tanzanian nurse who owns a dispensary in Bagamoyo Tanzania. Her name is Alice Munuo. Alice has been of much help by offering free medical treatment to the families living in extreme poverty conditions. Women from these families visit her clinic, mostly for maternity care. Normally, the women come to give birth with no resources and Alice goes out of her way to help them and even offer some food. But these handouts just help them for one day or two day and they go back and languish in poverty.</p>
<p>So I will pay forward the funds from my business to help these women to start small businesses related to farming, poultry and fishing in order to help improve their living standards.  When the women get profit from their small business they will pay forward to others who are extremely poor to start up even small businesses. </p>
<p>We hope that this circle will continue until everyone's living standards in the area improves. We will also follow-up every month and support where we can. </p>
<p>So please help me and I will help PiF participants and leaders to raise funds all over Africa and I will also pay forward the profits of my own work to very poor families in Bagamoyo with the help of Alice. </p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

My name is Cantwell Lihanda. My friends call me Canty. I live in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
My Indiegogo campaign is a fundraiser to expand my work which helps people in extreme poverty. 
Let me explain. 
I am the African communications coordinator for PiF, a different kind of micro business creator. PiF provides small business grants to people living in areas of extreme poverty. The grants help people to become self-sustaining through the creation of small business like kiosk pharmacies, piggeries, internet cafes, grocery shops, small fishing enterprises, home-based sewing businesses and many more. 
Instead of paying the grants back to a bank or loaning agency, the participants pay forward from their profits to people in their own social circles. This way, the profits are shared and keep growing exponentially.
You can find out more about PiF by going to www.communitybuilders.ca and clicking on the Pay it Forward links.  
My work involves traveling to remote village areas in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Burundi and DR Congo to coach and support people who want to help themselves by starting a small business after receiving a PiF grant. .  
When I am not travelling, I work out of my small home office in Dar es Salaam and this is where I need help.  
Let me explain more.
Everyone connected to PiF needs to be self-sufficient, even me, the communications coordinator. So far, Community Builders has spent $3,000 to train me and set me up in a home office in Dar es Salaam. But now I have to start a small business like all the other PiF participants and pay forward from my profits to people in extreme poverty. 
My business will be called PiF Crowd Funding Support Services. It is a business to help micro business people in extreme poverty to raise funds to start businesses through Indiegogo and other social media websites.
My business will assist 20 PiF leaders in five sub-Saharan countries and many of the more than 500 PiF participants to use PiF and Indiegogo services, as well as other social media tools to raise funds for their small businesses. I will ask each person I help to pay me a small portion of the funds they raise to pay for my services. 
In my business plan, the PiF leaders will raise a total of $20,000 over the next four months. I will ask for 10% of the funds raised, or $2,000. I will keep this approach going in the future and help to start more small businesses.
My own pay forward plan with the profits of my business is to help women and their families living in Bagamoyo, Tanzania. Most the families I want to reach out to have poor health and ragged clothes. They eat only one meal per day which is just a mixture of corn flour and vegetables.

So I will pay forward the funds from my business to help these women to start small businesses related to farming, poultry and fishing in order to help improve their living standards.  When the women get profit from their small business they will pay forward to others who are extremely poor to start up even small businesses. 
We hope that this circle will continue until everyone's living standards in the area improves. We will also follow-up every month and support where we can. 
So please help me and I will help PiF participants and leaders to raise funds all over Africa and I will also pay forward the profits of my own work to very poor families in Bagamoyo with the help of Alice. 
Thank you very much.

<h2 style='font-family: ""Trebuchet MS"";text-align: center;'>MID-DRIVE MOTOR<br/>...</h2>
<p>The mid-drive motor constantly samples relevant information at a frequency of up to 80k Hz via a torque sensor and two speed sensors which are all highly synchronized &amp; sensitive.</p>
<p>The resulting data on crank torque, vehicle speed and the speed of rotation of the pedals are made available to the controller, ensuring precise control of the vehicle while achieving the highest possible efficiency. The Max Drive System puts the rider in complete control. In spite of generous power output and a maximum torque of more than 160 N.m, the motor operates in virtual silence. The modular motor design and integrated controller make disassembly easier and improve service responsiveness.</p>

<p><strong>How much is the max allowed rider weight?</strong><br/>We have a lifetime frame warranty for the riders less than <strong>275lbs (125kg)</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>What is the standover height?</strong><br/>Standover height is the distance from the ground to the top of the top tube. In male mtb bikes, it is usually higher than the female versions. Prime gives you a combination of both at the same time so it's also very easy for females to ride without sacrificing the great design.</p>

</div></div>","Nireeka Prime with the most unique design ever for a bicycle, and a powerful mid-drive motor, a high range battery, will be going to create memorable experiences for you!We have perfected a way to balance fat bikes parameters by designing a completely new frame.



 
Welcome to our 2nd campaign on IGG!...
Prime is the result of 18 months of research and product development and a wealth of campaign management experience. We designed the product and campaign based on your feedback.


 
Begin your new adventure with the newest Nireeka model. With its polished carbon fiber frame, manufactured with the most durable and sustainable materials and garnished with an exquisite paint job, the Nireeka Prime is as much an art as it is a bicycle! Coming equipped with a mighty mid-drive Bafang propulsion powertrain, Nireeka Prime is voracious to rock up on all terrains.


WHY WE CALL IT THE SMARTEST?...


AS SEEN ON...





 
SO, WHAT IS PRIME EXACTLY?...
Prime is a purpose-built carbon fiber mid-drive electric motor ebike with 4"" fat tires and the huge 160nm of torque gives you the confidence to explore any land on the planet earth and beyond ;)



OVERVIEW...
• Incredibly lightweight, the whole bike weighs less than 26 KG.• Solid Monocoque Carbon fiber frame with a lifetime warranty.• Powerful mid-drive motor with more than 160nm torque.• Durable Li-ion LG battery.• 180mm rear/160mm fr hydraulic discs brake (203mm optional).• 10S Shimano Deore cassette.• Speed/Torque Sensor.• Walk mode. The bike assists you when walking with the bike.

All the features come with the most beautiful purpose-built ebike ever! It's not a converted one but a pure ebike.

 
WHY PRIME?...

Ride easily on sand, beach, snow, tarmac, mountain; literally everywhere. All you need is a purpose-built and solid frame, a set of fat tires, a powerful motor, and a durable battery. Simply a Nireeka Prime!

 
HEARTBEAT ASSIST (OPTIONAL NSD)...

This system uses your heartbeat rate to command the motor how much torque you need. You can set your lowest rate (Where the motor starts assisting), your highest rate (Where the motor gives you 100% of torque) and also gives you a comprehensive report.


 
ACCIDENT REPORT SYSTEM (OPTIONAL NSD)
...
What do you do after a crash?
Although a collision with an automobile, an obstacle or another cyclist are the greatest hazards cyclists face, there's something that makes it even more dangerous. What if you're not able to call the Police or someone else for help?
Happily, we have a solution for it.
""Our Smart system will send a TEXT MESSAGE containing your accurate location to a primary number you already set""


 
CARBON FIBER FRAME...

Our monocoque carbon fiber frame has been built by the EPS molding method which provides a clean internal surface just like the external surface. This results in a Zero Fiber Wrinkles which would've created an extra weight.

 

MID-DRIVE MOTOR...
The mid-drive motor constantly samples relevant information at a frequency of up to 80k Hz via a torque sensor and two speed sensors which are all highly synchronized & sensitive.
The resulting data on crank torque, vehicle speed and the speed of rotation of the pedals are made available to the controller, ensuring precise control of the vehicle while achieving the highest possible efficiency. The Max Drive System puts the rider in complete control. In spite of generous power output and a maximum torque of more than 160 N.m, the motor operates in virtual silence. The modular motor design and integrated controller make disassembly easier and improve service responsiveness.
Water-resistance components
 

 
TORQUE SENSOR...

The torque sensor measures your actual force on the pedal, sampling at 1,000 times per second over the entire pedal stroke. 
The harder you pedal, the more torque comes from the motor. It makes all these adjustments in real-time. Therefore, it is technically amplifying your every input. It feels like you are bionic. 

 
BATTERY...
 

Prime comes with the best quality Lithium-ion LG battery with 1,000 times charging time lifetime. There are two versions available, both 48V, the standard one is 10Ah (480Wh) and the upgraded one is 17Ah (816Wh).
It's easily removable and you can charge the battery either on the bike or take it off and charge it at the comfort of your home. 
Please note: The Prime battery is not the same model as the Nireeka Homie series.

Anti-theft system (OPTIONAL NSD):

UPGRADES...
Now, it's the time! Just go ahead and make your bike a dream machine by click on the below image,

 

 
GEOMETRY...

Prime is only available in one size which is 17"". Please check the below information to see if it's suitable for you.
Is Prime suitable for you?If your height is between 5'3"" (160 cm) and 6'9"" (206 cm) and your legs length is between 28"" (71 cm) to 32½"" (83 cm) the bike is perfect for you.

How much is the max allowed rider weight?We have a lifetime frame warranty for the riders less than 275lbs (125kg). 
What is the standover height?Standover height is the distance from the ground to the top of the top tube. In male mtb bikes, it is usually higher than the female versions. Prime gives you a combination of both at the same time so it's also very easy for females to ride without sacrificing the great design.

 
LIGHTWEIGHT FRAME & COMPONENTS...

Despite the gigantic body shape to have the battery inside, the frame is lightweight thanks to the carbon fiber frame and fork.


 


TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION...

* The default battery (10Ah 48V - 480Wh) provides 50 km (31 miles) range and the upgraded version (17Ah 48V - 816Wh) provides 80 km (50 miles) on the assist mode.

TIMELINE...


 
PRODUCTION...
In order for frames to be evaluated reliably, the test procedure must meet high standards of quality. Our tests make this possible by stressing the frame in a way similar to that in the real world situation and even harder conditions, with computerized measurement and control.
Since the carbon fiber frame has an unlimited fatigue life, we make sure our frames meet the same criteria by testing them in multi-thousand loops.

We ship to the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, China, Hong Kong, and all the EU countries. We do NOT ship to South America, New Zealand, and Africa.

Walmart’s shareholders are gathering in Bentonville, Arkansas in early June. My name is Dominic Ware, I am a Walmart worker and a leader in OUR Walmart. My co-workers and I want to go. 
 
Calls for change from Walmart workers have so far gone largely unanswered, Walmart workers and community supporters across the country are kicking off a national “Ride for Respect” to take our concerns directly to the executives and shareholders who could make change happen.
 
It’ll be a huge effort. In the spirit of the civil rights movement, the “Ride for Respect” is a week-long, nationwide caravan to Bentonville, and we want to ensure that OUR Walmart members from the Bay Area are able to hit the road and make our voices heard.
Walmart workers from The Bay will need funding to cover transportation, food, and lodging for the trip -- and it’s folks just like you who can help make it happen.
Please chip in right now.
Our goal is to raise enough money for 5 workers to fly from the Bay to Home Office (A One-Way ticket is $415 each), who cannot join us on the bus.  We don't want to leave anyone behind, as members of OUR Walmart - we stick together!
Even though Walmart makes more than $16 billion in profits each year, the retailer is creating jobs that keep its associates without enough hours, without healthcare, and struggling to get by on poverty wages.
 
As a result many of us can’t even support ourselves or our families without relying on government assistance, while the Walton family, which controls the company, has the wealth of 42 percent of American families combined, and its CEO rakes in more than 1,000 times the salary of the average Walmart worker.
 
That’s why we are calling for jobs with full-time hours and a minimum salary of $25,000 from Walmart -- and why your support is so important.
 
Please donate today to help OUR Walmart members from The Bay Area take the Ride for Respect!
 
Thanks so much,
 
Dominic from Walmart #5434 in San Leandro, CA

The more you push down on the throttle the more help you get from the motor. Throttle option is usually most helpful for getting back in motion after a complete stop at a red light or stop-sign. It is also useful for a quick boost of power on short but steep hills.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">2) <b>Pedal-Assist (PASS)</b>: This function only works when you are pedaling. 5 levels of assist are available that can be selected from the LCD Display. As you start pedaling the motor will kick in, and when you stop pedaling the motor turns off.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Levels 1-2 are typically used for long but relatively flat commutes. Levels 3-5 are ideal for  steep and long hills. On a flat road, level 5 assist will move you at about 20 mph with almost no effort from the rider. At assist level 0, the eBike behaves like a normal ""non-electric"" bicycle.

............................................................................................................................................ Elegant . Electric . Efficient      PhilosophyPropella's mission is to bridge the gap between regular bikes and electric bikes (eBikes). We strive for simplicity, and our minimalist design allows us to achieve our goal by eliminating unnecessary features and focusing on essential elements. Adding enormous battery capacity and power to an eBike can discourage riders from pedaling, reduce safety, and add excessive weight and cost. The right amount of power, however, can transform a bicycle into a lightweight, safe, and reliable electric vehicle.   Design Features                              Motor

Single-Speed freewheel attached to hub motor  Battery   
SAMSUNG Li-Ion Cells
Removable
Anti-theft Lock
Waterproof
36 Volt 6.6 Ah
2.5 Hour Charge Time
USB Output Plug
 Samsung 18650 Lithium Ion Cells (Used in Tesla Model S)The battery pack is equipped with electronics that automatically prevent the cells from getting overcharged or over-discharged.    Standard USB output plug for charging cellphones or other USB-enabled devices Frame Size ............................................................................................................................................ How it works A boost of power whenever you need it!  You can pedal this eBike just like a normal bicycle and use the electric assist (if desired)  in two simple ways:  1) Throttle: The motor will push you forward at anytime by pressing down on the throttle. The more you push down on the throttle the more help you get from the motor. Throttle option is usually most helpful for getting back in motion after a complete stop at a red light or stop-sign. It is also useful for a quick boost of power on short but steep hills.2) Pedal-Assist (PASS): This function only works when you are pedaling. 5 levels of assist are available that can be selected from the LCD Display. As you start pedaling the motor will kick in, and when you stop pedaling the motor turns off.Levels 1-2 are typically used for long but relatively flat commutes. Levels 3-5 are ideal for  steep and long hills. On a flat road, level 5 assist will move you at about 20 mph with almost no effort from the rider. At assist level 0, the eBike behaves like a normal ""non-electric"" bicycle. This is useful for maximum exercise and calorie burn.   ............................................................................................................................................   Rim Color   ............................................................................................................................................ Full Specs               ...........................................................................................................................................  Social Media pages            www.facebook.com/propellabikes www.instagram.com/propellabikes          www.twitter.com/propellabikes ............................................................................................................................................. .............................................................................................................................................. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)- How can I contact Propella?Please contact us here on Indiegogo, or visit our website www.propellabikes.com  - Do you ship internationally?Currently we offer USA and CANADA shipping only.

</div></div>","Distracted and drowsy driving (DDD) is a major problem
on the roads. According to the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration (NHTSA), it is one of the leading causes of vehicle crashes
involving fatalities and bodily injuries.The Drive Guardian: Driver Drowsy Safety Alert System
comes equipped with a high performance camera that will intelligently monitor the
driver's eyes and pupils in real-time. Utilizing sophisticated algorithms, the
Drive Guardian will alert the driver by displaying LED indicator lights and sounding
audio warnings whenever they are drowsy or distracted.








Once the engine starts, the Drive Guardian will immediately monitor the driver’s eyes and pupils. Depending on the type of behavior the driver exhibits –heavy/prolonged fluttering eyes due to sleepiness, looking away from the road due to distractions, the Drive Guardian will sound a variation of alerts. Having the Drive Guardian with you is just like having a protective companion by your side while you are driving.



      






The Drive Guardian will be especially useful for fleet managers or independent truck operators because it will provide them with a highly effective tool that will prevent costly crashes due to DDD and help lower their CSA score.




Features:



Intelligent image monitoring algorithm and
     intuitively smart recognition system
Detection and warning of drowsiness, negligence
     in looking forward, and face departure  while driving
Cognitive operational scenario for early warning
     by both the indication LEDs and the speaker sounds
