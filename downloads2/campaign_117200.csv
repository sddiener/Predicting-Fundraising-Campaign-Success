 My story comes from a mix of all the people around me. The relationship that Grandmaa Laart has with Rastapixie has the flavour of the relationship between my daughter and my mother. The twin's characters are influenced by my sister. Our father gave my sister the nickname of Noodle. My sister was meant to be a twin, but the other one died in the womb.

Otherwise my imagination ran wild thinking of a little girl surrounded by love and beautiful nature. She is a colourful, fun character who learns from her victories and mistakes. She loves music and when she grows her wings she will be eventually travelling the world learning about different cultures and the native music belonging to them. She has something very special going on too! When Rastapixie shakes her dreadlocks she comes up with magical songs!

Rastapixies Adventures in its full glory, will be fun, warm and show children that the challenge of going to school for the first time can be overcome. It also deals with our differences as Rastpixie learns about her own mix through being both Rasta and Pixie. This brings in the aspect of bi racial children having a positive character to relate to, and full acceptance of who they are. My own daughter is a mix of Jamaican and Peruvian. There are some words and foods mentioned that are from the West Indies. I will include a glossary and maybe even a recipe for Ital stew!

MY STORY
 
My name is Kelli Klymenko - I'm an artist, writer,
photographer, blogger and Sedona Arts Centerâ€™s Marketing & Events
Coordinator and I am determined to create deities. This project was originally supposed to consist of ONLY celebrities. But I thought to myself, ""Why stop there? Why limit yourself? Aren't we all 'celebrities' - aren't we all 'deities'?"" - and so, I decided to revive the project after a few years and include everyone. Every deity, every divine person that I could think of. 
And when asked, itâ€™s not that hard to figure
out which deity you can relate to. For instance, when asked what deity they
would be: Ashley Judd (@AshleyJudd) says, â€œAthenaâ€ and Milla Jovovich
(@MillaJovovich) also responded, â€œprobably Athena cause she busted out of her
dads head n can turn ppl in2 spiders!â€ Fairuza Balk (@fairuza) wrote, â€œhmmmm,
Tara maybe? (Buddhist pantheon) or maybe Ishtar or Diana?â€ Perry Farrell wants
to be â€œJohn Lennonâ€ and Elaine Hendrix (@elaine4animals) replied, â€œWonder
Woman! (or Tara)â€THE PROJECT
''Kelli Klymenko's God's & Goddesses'' is a unique project that
shares with humanity, a unified voice - a vision through an elaborate
photography and film collection. In today's society, it is visual stimuli that
defines who we are, and carves out a path to our future actions. We have deified
celebrities, friends, people who are 'inaccessible' and those who entertain us.
Those who we have placed on a pedestal for either good or bad, as negative, or
positive role models - are the gods and goddesses of modern times. THE IMPACT
 
Humanity knows over 3000 supernatural
beings or deities. Many of us recognize that these gods, these goddesses have
been our own creations - our own fabrications that were used to give reason and
truth to our misconceptions of the Universe we call home. Join all the gods and
goddesses of myth and legend, of religion and fantasy and create one great
story - a snapshot in time, this time - right now. Understanding is more
powerful than believing.
 
We are all works in progress. Even the
slightest action will create ripples, then waves through time. My intentions
are to share one simple thing:Unity : Unity in Life, Conservation, Preservation and Humanity. WHAT WE NEED 
''Kelli Klymenko's God's & Goddesses''
(THIS PROJECT) needs
your help to 'get the ball rolling'  - I need the funds for props,
wardrobe, location, lighting, etc. The more
funding I get, the more deities I will be able to create! I intend to create
posters, postcards, mini god and goddess cards and a printed book. ALL my
previous creative projects, including the Nemesis Showing and Gallery
Collectives were 100% fully funded by me. This time I need your help to make
this dream a reality!

Grow | Learn | Conserve | Preserve |
Question | Denounce | Educate | Change | Free your mind | EVOLVE
We all have the ability to make a difference in this world. I intend to take
the faces we most recognize and represent them in images that have transformed
societies over the millennia â€“ and by doing so, deify ourselves through these
images. Every human face has a deity that can represent them, and every deity
is simply a reflection of our human selves. 
 
We are all divine. 
 
Which God are you? Which Goddess are you?
 
Deify yourself. By seeing the divine in
you, it is easier for each of us to see the divine within.
We live in one of the most influential times in all history - I ask you to join
the beginning of the revolution - and be a part of just one of the millions of
changes we will all make together.Thank you for your support!
 
''Kelli Klymenko's God's & Goddesses'' will be:

Images: Posters, Prints, Postcards
Books: Collection of Gods & Goddesses with
     descriptions and 'attributes' of those deities, model's thoughts and
     interpretations.
Videos: Behind the scenes videos of shoots, model's
     take on the deity they represent and more!
God & Goddess cards - think saint prayer cards,
     but new and fun!

poet out of Denver, CO.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate enough to represent Denver, CO and
the Denver Mercury Poetry Slam at 9 different National Poetry Slam
competitions.</p>
<p>I have recently won a wonderful opportunity to again
represent my city and venue (The Mercury Cafe) at the Individual World Poetry
Slam competition taking place Sept 3-5 in Spokane, WA. Being that I make a
small (but rewarding) full time living traveling performing poetry, I need a
bit of assistance for this trip. </p>
<p>With this campaign, I am looking to cover the cost of the
flight to/from Spokane, motel lodging, and incidental expenses (food, etc)
while I am there. </p>
<p>Denver, over the years, has made quite a name for itself
in the national poetry slam scene:Two adult national championship teams, 2
youth national slam (Brave New Voices) championship teams, and individual
champions at both IWPS and the Women Of The World poetry slams. I hope to
continue that tradition this year in Spokane.</p>

<p>The Magical World of Dr. Joseph Lisiewski by Mark Stavish</p>
<p>Few figures in the contemporary world of occultism have garnered the admiration and vitriol as has Dr. Joseph Charles Lisiewski (1947 – 2016). Born in the rugged coal mining region of Central Pennsylvania, Lisiewski came of age in an era when the grip of religious orthodoxy was waning, but the magical world of the ‘Counter Culture Movement’ was not yet fully born. After a terrifying magical evocation at the age of 17, he was quickly admitted to the ranks of the few to find himself involved with two of the greatest occultists of the Twentieth Century – Israel Regardie and Frater Albertus.  Having worked closely with both men for years, he detailed his unique relationship with them in the only book to date written about either man – Israel Regardie and the Philosopher’s Stone (2008).  Having worked closely with Lisiewski on that book, as well as others, in The Magical World of Dr. Joseph Lisiewski I tell the story of our decade long friendship, the magical and alchemical projects we worked together on, the truth behind his academic claims, and details on the final ritual I performed for him – an exorcism for a ritual that went bad, and for which he claimed would ultimately take his life.  This book is not only a peak behind the curtain at the life of a man who can rightly be called the most controversial ceremonial magician of the early Twenty-First Century, but also a look at the context of his life astrologically, socially, and in light of the alchemical and magical revival of which he was an integral part.  A must book for anyone interested in one of best known, and least understood figures of modern occultism. </p>
<p>By participating as a sponsor in the publication of this memoire you are adding yourself to that chain of adepts that can rightly be said to go back to ""European Occult Revival"" of the 19th Century and earlier.  This, like so many, is ""a cautionary tale"" and one from which tremendous information about Lisiewski, magic, and even ourselves can be gained. </p>
<p>The Institute for Hermetic Studies has conducted three successful Indiegogo campaigns, each one exceeding its stated goal and resulting in the publication of unique, informative, and needed educational tools for contemporary students of esotericism.  These are more than just ideas, but ideas that when applied improve the quality of our lives. </p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in supporting the publication of The Magical World of Dr. Joseph Lisiewski.  Unlike our previous fundraising efforts for publishing materials of high interest but limited marketability, we are asking patrons to support us at one of four listed levels.  The reason for this is simple:  we do not have the time and resources to hunt down a large number of smaller donations to get to achieve our goal and we wish to have the book published before the end of this summer.  Given the unique and historical nature of this book, I am sure you will agree that this is a rare opportunity to not just read about the life of a famous occultist, but in this manner, actually become a part of it, and of the lessons it has to teach those still on the Path.  This also brings us to another point, this book is about the lessons of life and magic, we want you to recognize as well as participate in the sacrifice that means.  For this reason we are limiting the usual promotional perks associated with donations, and instead asking you to donate because it is something you want to do, want to be a part of, and to pay attention to the words on the page and their impact on your heart, rather than be seduced into participating by a participation award.  I do not say this lightly, I deeply appreciate your support. There is much to be learned from the life and magical practices of Lisiewski, lessons that will stay with you and change your life, and the lives of others for the better, long after you have put the book down and my signature and dedication to you has faded.  So, I extend my hand and welcome you to join with me in this adventure, and to have your name forever a part of this unique historical legacy and the powerful lessons it has to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Date of release:</strong>  July 2017 in conjunction with the one-year anniversary of Lisiewski's ""Great Initiation into the Eternal Orient.""</p>

<h3>Since beginning that life work I have been given opportunities to learn more about rites of passage with immersion into working with a range of people including supporting teens and their parents with the Teen Journey summer programs. People have come forward to be supported in life changes of a wide range including exiting from trauma,forgiveness,grief as well as several wedding ceremonies, retirement and preparation for dying. Each of these experiences has overwhelmed me with their expressions of humanity and affirmed the value of this work.</h3>
<h3>This path has been in large part to do with speaking before audiences on this subject and getting the idea out to people directly via the oral tradition. In February 2011 I produced a Rites of Passage Evolver Salon at W2 in Vancouver and presented a 10 minute <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hSHL9C3Ol0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TEDx talk</a> on Rites of Passage at UBC and began broadcasting this message of renewing rites of passage to the worldwide web. Since 2009 I have presented Rites of Passage presentations at Entheos Conference, a GVIAS Burning Man event, Motion Notion, Bass Coast, and Eclipse Festival in Australia. In September 2012 I was brought to Lakehead University and spoke in front of 300 environmental studies students on rites of passage. I have also mentored with<a href=""http://www.teenjourney.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Teen Journey </a>program in 2010 and 2011 with teens and assisted the parents in contextualizing the rites of passage they and their teen were undergoing. In December 2011 and October 2012 I was featured in an interview on rites of passage on <a href=""http://www.blogtalkradio.com/suzannetoro/2012/01/06/besimplysobey-wing-tribal-harmonix"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blogtalk Radio </a>with Suzanne Toro and <a href=""http://50.19.242.233/media/rites-of-passage-with-sobey-wing-on-living-proof-r"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Living Proof</a> with Tammra Broughton. My final speaking engagement of 2012 will be at Uplift Festival in Byron Bay,Australia.</h3>
<h3>
<br/><em>My Goal</em>
</h3>
<h3>I wish to encapsulate what I have been gleaning from my experiences around rites of passage and talks on the subject to commence my first book on the subject to be published through Evolver Network as an accessibly priced and e-published book online as well as Evolver Editions as a soft copy book. I would like this to be a practical tool for any global citizen to make use of for navigating their own rites of passage and assisting others with theirs. I also view it as important to have information like this available in multiple mediums. The larger goal is community resiliency and cultural healing through renewing rites of passage literacy and practices. I wish to include interviews with a range of people involved in this field I have come in contact with and will be coming in contact with in coming months. This will include both indigenous and non-indigenous individuals seeking to reach a broad audience. A potential film is also awaiting future discussion with a film maker on the Sunshine Coast of BC.</h3>
<h3><em>Many Roots &amp; Beginnings</em></h3>
<h3>The rites of Passage pathway for me has stemmed from the lifelong learning ethic I gained at S.E.E.D. Alternative School in Toronto in the early 90's and nurtured further by the concept of ethical eco-entrepreneurship I gained at Wondertree Natural Learning Foundation in 1997. It poured through me under the guise of eco-education, which I thought during my 5 years of doing it with the province of BC,would be my career. It touched me deeply when I made my first move out of the city to the Sunshine Coast of BC and got initiated into Permaculture Design with the EcoTech program created by GaiaCraft. <br/>It has been also incubating within a nascent culture emerging on the west coast of North America that I have been a part of for 14 years. Currently it is referred to as transformational dance culture. This has included event organizing,djing, being a part of Tribal Harmonix,Earthdance International, Gathering of the Tribes network, Burning Man community, Entheos Gathering, Evolver Network &amp; Tribal Convergence/Convergence Network. I've been involved in coordinating annual winter retreats, moderating online community discussions, coordinating Burning Man camps and integrating elements of intentional community building and popular education along with creating ceremonies and sacred dances shared at gatherings.</h3>
<h3>This work also is in the lineage of the harm reduction movement which has run through dance culture for over a decade with its ethic of looking after one another. It has taken me into working with addiction therapy with the Iboga Therapy House and currently is being tied in with a new forming network called the Healing Garden Peer Support Project in East Vancouver.</h3>
<h3>Dance and movement has also been an integral aspect of rites of passage for me. In 2011 I was gifted a scholarship with a movement based rites of passage dance camp in Boulder Colorado in the summer of 2011 with Melissa Michaels Ed.D. Melissa is truly an inspiration to me with the way she has fused ecstatic dance with rites of passage along with other modalities.</h3>
<h3>This lifework has another taproot in living indigenous traditions that have carried rites of passage in their more valuable forms throughout the ages. This began in many ways with exploring my own ancestry on my mothers side on my visits to the Philippines.  I have made contact with Palawan tribes in 1999/2000 and an eco-spiritual community based in Manila and Puerta Princessa in 2006.In Vancouver I have shared this self-discovery by co-mentoring with Momentum Youth Project and Kathara Canada several years ago in a 6 month project with new immigrant youth connecting with their cultural roots and drawing from filipino indigenous culture as a source of inspiration and youth empowerment. I have periodically performed with Kathara Canada reenacting myths and legends.</h3>
<h3>
<br/><em>Bridge Building with Indigenous Networks</em>
</h3>
<h3>Over the years I have been building bridges wherever possible with indigenous networks and introduced the neotribal dance culture to the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers Council in South Dakota in 2007. The past 4 tears I have attended the International Indigenous Leadership Gatherings in BC reconnecting with long lost Earth relatives and began to further my understanding of indigenous ceremonial protocol. I organized a follow up council to the IILG in Vancouver joined by visiting Maori's Issac James Bishara &amp; Lucy Tukua. That same year I connected with Four Worlds International and its founder hereditary chief Phil Lane Jr which is working to unite the human family drawing from the wisdom of the Medicine Wheel,Talking Circles and Healing Circles. Also in 2010 on my birthday I was blessed to be able to visit Brazil to connect with the Yawanawa tribe of the Amazon in 2010 supported in large part by my community. In June 2012 as an organizer with Entheos Conference I welcomed International Indigenous Leadership Gathering organizer and former chief Darrell Bob to speak with festival guests. Last September 2012 I presented in combination with Peruvian Maestro Juan Flores at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay,Ontario. He spoke about the healing plants of Amazonia and I spoke about rites of passage with around 300 of their environmental studies students and faculty.</h3>
<h3>
<br/><em><strong>Present &amp; Upcoming Future</strong></em>
</h3>
<h3>
<br/>In 2010 while in ceremony in the Brazilian Amazon I had a strong feeling that I needed to write a book about rites of passage that harvests the experiences had thus far in life and makes them universally accessible. I have been working on an outline since then and am now ready to put this in motion. 2012 has kept me busy focusing on many other projects that all hold great value to me but that book is kicking inside me waiting to get out.</h3>
<h3>Additionally I have been invited to Australia for the Total Eclipse Festival in November where I will be presenting to an international audience on Rites of Passage. I saw the opportunity to remain afterwards for the duration of a tourist visa. During that time I have envisioned a period of working on this book collecting interviews while participating in conscious community events and sharing workshops with some dj sets. Thus far I have a set of confirmed itinerary including workshops at Uplift, Subsonic Festival and Rainbow Serpent. I am also going to be presenting in Byron Bay at Starseed Garden and interviewing Zenith Virago, a well known author and modern celebrant for weddings as well as natural and holistic approaches to dying, death and funerals. Also in Byron Bay I have been welcomed to participate with the Rites of Passage Institute's Raising Men Program.  </h3>
<h3>
<br/><strong><em>What I need crowd funding and support with</em></strong>
</h3>
<h3>
<br/><strong>This being my first novel I have been struggling to maintain the momentum beyond my outline of the book thus far. I wish to be able to focus on this project while in Australia and have it as my primary mission while there. I am travelling on limited funds and will be seeking perches to land on where I can further this goal of the book while contributing with work exchange or rites of passage services where possible. I would like to return to Vancouver in February of 2013 with enough material to begin condensing into a book, even as a work in progress that can be revised as time goes by but with enough valuable material to warrant a wide audience. From November to January I will be travelling from Cairns to Melbourne and seek mainly to supplement the savings I have enough so I can commit to the writing of this book. I welcome my writer friends to coach me. This is a work I am committed to and I value the Indie GoGo's example of a crowdfunding platform and have already benefited from it in the past. What I learned from that experience was not so much how to make a lot of money but the value of using this medium to inform people of a vision that they too can participate in making real. I hope that what I write will hold something priceless I can return to those who have invested their support in me, something that will empower them in their own life transitions and their loved ones. I hope that together we will then be able to spread this to as many people as possible.</strong>

<h3>How was <i>Christmas Carol</i>  born?</h3>
<ul><li><p>It all began when Lynn was channel surfing during the holiday season and landed on her least favorite Christmas movie.  She wondered:  Who would Christmas <i>Carol</i>  be? What would she be like? Instantly, Lynn knew that Carol would have magical abilities, and live in a group home in the cold, snowy mountains of New Hampshire. Even though she'd never written a novel, both the beginning and ending were immediately clear to Lynn. </p></li></ul>

It all began when Lynn was channel surfing during the holiday season and landed on her least favorite Christmas movie.  She wondered:  Who would Christmas Carol  be? What would she be like? Instantly, Lynn knew that Carol would have magical abilities, and live in a group home in the cold, snowy mountains of New Hampshire. Even though she'd never written a novel, both the beginning and ending were immediately clear to Lynn. 
What We Need & What You Get

The book is written, the illustrations are complete, and we've already ordered hardcover books to ensure you'll receive yours by Christmas! A portion of the profit from your order of this autographed hardcover will go toward a much larger book order in 2020.  
Please check out the perks to see which suits you best. 
Even if we aren't 100% funded, you will still receive your perks.

Perks with Multiple Books
Perks with multiple book options are a great choice, not only for gift giving, but also for donating. They make an especially nice option for reading programs, classrooms, libraries, shelters, holiday toy drives, grandparents, teachers, aunts, uncles, etc! 5 or more books are upgraded to Priority Mail.
About Lynn
Lynn is a native New Hampshire mother and wife. If she's not writing, Lynn might be found taking care of her disabled dog, or tending to her chickens. Lynn plans more adventures for her main character, twelve-year-old Carol. Her extensive travels, both in and out of the United States, will likely be used for future novels.

<p>In 2012, I founded Gay Men of Wisdom, an international
project that helps gay men discover how we benefit and serve humanity. As a
trained life coach, I created this project to help gay men expand our
self-understanding and -awareness. For as far as the LGBT movement has come,
gay men still have no common narrative that says, “This is what we do for the
world. This is why you need us.”</p>
<p>For the last two years, I have run programs that have
brought ideas from the great gay thinkers to groups of gay men, where we
discussed, “tried on,” and expanded upon these concepts. My goal has been to
help gay men who attend my programs to discover how these ideas apply to
them. <i>A New Identity for Gay Men</i>
brings together this research, which is grounded in both the literature and gay
men’s lived experiences.</p>
<p>This book will introduce an entirely new way of seeing gay
men. While it will honor and integrate gay male sexuality, it will invite us to
look beyond our status as a sexual minority. 
It will propose a new identity based on the roles that gay men play in
the world, which contribute critically to the welfare and vitality of the human
race. </p>
<p><i>A New Identity for Gay
Men</i> will take an open-hearted, honest look at all of who we are as gay men,
including the differences that the community often downplays or disowns.
Central to this book’s thesis is <i>honoring</i>
these differences. The book will identify and explore the 13 Distinct Gay Male
Gifts, and the trait that underlies all these gifts.  It will challenge the reader to look at the
shadow self, and it will chart a path to who we can become as gay men of
wisdom. By honoring our differences, this book invites other members of the
LGBT community—and indeed other minority groups—to consider how they contribute
to the human family.</p>
<h3>What I Need and What You Get</h3><p></p>
<p>I am in conversation with two publishers, both of which have
received my book proposal and given me a warm response. I cannot know the
timing of a forthcoming book contract, but the signs look good.</p>
<p>I have received $7,000 in seed money from Bronze Optical, a gay-owned business located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. One half of
the couple who owns this business is Will Fellows, author of <i>A Passion to Preserve: Gay Men as Keepers of Culture</i>. This book, in fact initially inspired me to create Gay Men of
Wisdom. Their financial backing speaks to the faith they have in my ideas and
ability to bring them forth in this book.</p><p>Toby Johnson, former editor of the White Crane Journal and author of <i>Gay Spirituality</i> and <i>Gay Perspective</i> enthusiastically calls <i>A New Identity for Gay Men,</i> ""a really good, useful, and important book."" </p>
<p>A book of this scale takes months to write. I began it in
February 2014 and anticipate completing the manuscript by the end of the year.
I need an additional $25,000, which will enable me to write through the year’s end. This funding will help cover my living expenses so I can focus my time and energy on writing and bringing this vision to fruition. </p>
<p>The perks I am offering range from hand-written thank-you
notes for everyone who contributes a minimum of $25 to complimentary access to
my new program, Radical Self-Love: A Journey to the Gifted Gay Man Within, which
launches in the fall.  Everyone who
contributes at $50 or above receives a copy of the book when it is published.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p>
<p>When you contribute to this campaign, you will help advance
a much larger understanding of who gay men are and what we do in and for the
world. This new approach has profound implications:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>Imagine a community of gay men who intrinsically
understand their gifted nature and value themselves<br/>

<h3>A Message from the Author</h3>
<p>Hello, I’m Marie Angelo, delighted to be writing to you as author of the Splendor Solis Tarot and Book. If you love images, inner journeys, and mystic symbols, you will love this glorious set, which is at once a radiant work of art, a full deck of 78 cards in one-to-one alignment with the well-loved tarot emblems, and an apprentice alchemist’s guide to the mystic journey.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, the vision of a Splendor Solis Tarot to be shared by all became a real possibility, for I acquired the glorious M. Moliero exact copy with permissions to reproduce the illuminations, and later was given permission to quote the text direct from translator Jocelyn Godwin. Since then my heart has been given to making that dream a reality. I’ve worked with a small student-research group, making templates, draft cards, journeying into the illuminations to record their words, so I can bring this Splendor Solis Tarot and Book to light, as the illuminations themselves would wish.</p>
<p>It is their time to shine, and all is now ready for the final step. High-quality production is needed, and printing and distribution costs must be met, but I know there are enough people whose vision is in tune with ‘the great work’, and who will want to be part of something so special. How valuable and well-loved this Treasure Box of delights will become! I am so glad to be inviting you in.</p>

<h3>An overview of the Splendor Solis Tarot cards</h3>
<p>The Major Arcana cards are known as the Artisans, comprising the original 22 Splendor Solis illuminations as the inner alchemies of the traditional Tarot cards. The Artisans reveal their transformative and creative powers, weaving the worlds along the pathways of the Tree of Life. </p>
<p>The Minor Arcana of the Splendor Solis Tarot comprises the Ambassadors, numbered from Ace to Ten, and the Awakeners, who bring us the inner alchemies of the traditional court cards. </p>

<p>The alchemical transformation of the Elements is expressed in their names of Golden Earth, Sparkling Air, Starry Water and Living Fire. </p>
<p>The Awakeners, as priests and priestesses of the Elements, assist the apprentice alchemist to awaken aspects of body, mind, soul and spirit into greater awareness. </p>
<p>These cards are works in progress, and the representations here illustrate initial ideas and draft renderings of what will become much more refined and complete as the work progresses towards completion by the end of this year. </p>

<h3>Guide to the Mystic Journey</h3>
<p>Discover the Substance of Stories, Symbols and Spiritual adventures!  </p>
<p>The Splendor Solis Tarot Book is a true ‘Book of Splendors’, introducing an initiatory journey through the visionary imagination, distilling an entire Mystery School of studies… The introduction sets the scene, showing how the book is written through the eyes of the Alchemical Apprentice, telling the fabulous tale of travels into the imaginal, where Tarot and Splendor Solis meet as ‘Prospero’s books’. In Shakespeare’s <u>Tempest</u> the Magus abandons his books to the deeps, but we ‘dream the myth onward’, to see his wonderful daughter Miranda return to the island, seeking her own magical, alchemical wisdom. As the pages unfold, you can join with the Apprentice Alchemist and be invited ‘inside the images’, greeted by the animate sun who explains their origin, symbols and patterns, and offers guided reveries into the ‘chapel of the heart’ and ‘court of the philosophers’, from which to meet the Splendor Solis Tarot Artisans, Ambassadors and Awakeners.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>“It is nearly thirty years since finding three of these unique and remarkable Splendor Solis images at the Warburg Institute, while researching my dissertation on Neoplatonic thought and Elizabethan drama. To find that Marie Angelo has woven together the complete suite of images, to create a work facilitating a near-infinite number of exploratory inner journeys, feels like finding a long-lost, precious treasure. Marie's depth of knowledge and her utmost care with the originals are wonderful and exciting.”</strong></i></p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>Please help spread the word! </strong>Your generosity and enthusiasm in sharing our link with friends, groups, forums and websites, and telling everyone you meet who has an interest in the Tarot will make a huge difference. We need each person who may be interested to know about the special perks exclusive to this campaign in plenty of time so they don't miss out.</p>
<p>Please also remember that you are directly helping to support independent publishing so we can go on to make more Tarot card sets and books about the subjects you love in the future; every time you buy a standard trade edition of a book or Tarot Card set from a bookstore or any of the large online retailers instead of direct from Alchimia, you are actually giving your money to them — we get very little in return from such sales, leaving less income for authors and artists thus making it very much harder for us to finance future treasures. In fact the mark-ups demanded by the major online stores are now at a level that means the only way we can keep doing what we love is due to the kindness of all the valued people who directly support Alchimia by either buying from our website (<a href=""http://www.alchimiapublishing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.alchimiapublishing.com</a>) or by backing campaigns such as this one.</p>

The Splendor Solis Tarot Book is a true ‘Book of Splendors’, introducing an initiatory journey through the visionary imagination, distilling an entire Mystery School of studies… The introduction sets the scene, showing how the book is written through the eyes of the Alchemical Apprentice, telling the fabulous tale of travels into the imaginal, where Tarot and Splendor Solis meet as ‘Prospero’s books’. In Shakespeare’s Tempest the Magus abandons his books to the deeps, but we ‘dream the myth onward’, to see his wonderful daughter Miranda return to the island, seeking her own magical, alchemical wisdom. As the pages unfold, you can join with the Apprentice Alchemist and be invited ‘inside the images’, greeted by the animate sun who explains their origin, symbols and patterns, and offers guided reveries into the ‘chapel of the heart’ and ‘court of the philosophers’, from which to meet the Splendor Solis Tarot Artisans, Ambassadors and Awakeners.
 
“It is nearly thirty years since finding three of these unique and remarkable Splendor Solis images at the Warburg Institute, while researching my dissertation on Neoplatonic thought and Elizabethan drama. To find that Marie Angelo has woven together the complete suite of images, to create a work facilitating a near-infinite number of exploratory inner journeys, feels like finding a long-lost, precious treasure. Marie's depth of knowledge and her utmost care with the originals are wonderful and exciting.”
~ Michael Pailthorpe

How You Can Help
Please help spread the word! Your generosity and enthusiasm in sharing our link with friends, groups, forums and websites, and telling everyone you meet who has an interest in the Tarot will make a huge difference. We need each person who may be interested to know about the special perks exclusive to this campaign in plenty of time so they don't miss out.
Please also remember that you are directly helping to support independent publishing so we can go on to make more Tarot card sets and books about the subjects you love in the future; every time you buy a standard trade edition of a book or Tarot Card set from a bookstore or any of the large online retailers instead of direct from Alchimia, you are actually giving your money to them — we get very little in return from such sales, leaving less income for authors and artists thus making it very much harder for us to finance future treasures. In fact the mark-ups demanded by the major online stores are now at a level that means the only way we can keep doing what we love is due to the kindness of all the valued people who directly support Alchimia by either buying from our website (www.alchimiapublishing.com) or by backing campaigns such as this one.
A massive thank you if you do pledge by selecting one of the perks and join us in helping to make this stunning new book and Tarot card set a reality in the most spectacular format imaginable.

I intertwined my amusing art career journey with the stories of other creative mavericks who inspired me to pave my own way. I talk about all the harebrained ideas that worked despite the naysayers. I share with you real stories of failure, mistakes, wins, successes, and all the things that lead us from having nothing to being able to hang out in a studio in our pajamas all day.

I wrote this book because I had always been obsessed with living as a creative, but spent the majority of my life avoiding it because I was too afraid to fail at something I loved. After having spent 12 years in the ""comfort"" of the corporate world, I left and ventured on a creative journey that pushed me beyond what I thought was possible. I started with absolutely nothing to my name, and over the course of a decade, I have built an amazing life as a full-time creative. </p><p>I have spent the last ten years collecting notes, documenting the process, testing out different theories, challenging the status quo, learning rules and breaking them in order to create myself as a full-time artist who runs his own studio and lives life by his own rules. These books are a collection of that experience thus far. Starting with the Survival Guide, this book has a little bit of everything from my journey into creativity. </p><p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will understand how to grow your personal creative brand as an artist while still having fun. I hope to instill the same passion and excitement that I have for life and being a creative human in this modern world full of opportunities. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool or guide to help you understand how to grab the machete and cut your own trail through the dense forest that is the artist's life. I also want to secretly inspire you to blaze your own trail as brightly as any awesome human can... and if you’re not into that, I want you to enjoy the fun stories, cliff hangers, ridiculous situations, and all-out creative conundrums that fill the pages of this book.</p><p>In this book, you’ll learn that the advice of most “experts” in the art world is crap and outdated… Luckily I’m not an expert, so who knows what kind of crazy shit is going to come out of my mouth. I will, however, point out several rules from people in the art world and layout the flaws in their thinking and philosophy. The other thing I will touch on throughout this book is the power of having the right mindset in approaching potentially disastrous situations or circumstances as you traverse your creative journey into the unknown. I will also talk about dealing with the naysayers who lurk in dark corners… or your house. </p><p>You will love this book if you are a casual hobbyist, a fine artist, a musician, a creative, an artist looking to up their game, or you are simply a human who breathes air.

I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Publishing All Books</strong> - I have calculated the lowest possible price for advanced pre-order sales which need to be ordered in bulk. </li>
<li>
<strong>An Editor</strong> - I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript for the draft book.  (Pre Order Release Date) December 2nd, 2019.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Cover Design Of My Book</strong> - I’ll be designing something based on the design in the mockup, and consulting with a professional book artist. Ultimately, I'll be designing this mostly myself, so the cost won't be great, but I need advice from a professional. </li>
<li>
<strong>The Layout Design</strong> for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>
<strong>Copyediting For My Book</strong> - to help polish the grammar (which I really need) and spelling prior to publication, and to help make the book more interesting. </li>
<li>
<strong>Organizing And Structuring My Book</strong> - I'll need time to finish the final draft once changes are made and new sections are added. I will need the time, and additional finances will help me take a break from the studio and focus on the book and meet all my deadlines.</li>
<li>
<strong>Proofing</strong> - I'll be going back and forth with the publisher and ordering several proofs. </li>
<li>
<strong>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts For My Book</strong> - when I ultimately publish next winter.</li>
<li>
<strong>Designing And Ordering Insert Materials </strong>- For all the additional digital cards and fun materials that will be included with your book.</li>
<li>
<strong>Packaging Materials</strong> - In order to ship everything out in time, I'll have to preorder boxes and other packaging materials that can only be purchased in bulk.</li>
</ul><p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book via this campaign:</p><ul>
<li><span><i><strong>Y</strong></i><strong style=""font-style: italic;"">ou will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish an early release on December 2nd.</strong></span></li>
<li><i><strong>You will receive the book before the official release date in February of 2020.</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>A personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book.</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>Your Name will appear in a Special Acknowledgements section of my book (“with Special Thanks To”).</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>Early access to the introduction of my book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback, before the official release date in February.</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>I will keep you up to date on the process at least once a week up until the early release of the book. I will stay in touch after the book release if you would like.</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my final cover design. </strong></i></li>
</ul><p> </p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is finding the time to organize, rewrite, and finish drafts.  It will be the back and forth between the publishers and myself that will take the most time, effort and money. I am hoping that we get enough pre-orders to give me the finances I need to be able to use that time and additional expense budget to work through any problems that may arise.</p><p>Mailing the books on time will also be paramount and brings with it all kinds of challenges. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the packaging and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.</p><p>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with Lulu Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. The plan is to have the books in my hands no later than November 30th, I will sign them and package myself and they should all ship out the following week.</p><p>I will keep you up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship ahead of time.</p><p>If I do not reach my goal, I will continue with the pre-release launch on December 2nd for the physical copy of the books, but the audiobook may be pushed back to the middle or end of December. </p><p> </p><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p><p>Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network.

We will schedule our visit with you for 2020. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with Lulu Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

Publishing All Books - I have calculated the lowest possible price for advanced pre-order sales which need to be ordered in bulk. 

An Editor - I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript for the draft book.  (Pre Order Release Date) December 2nd, 2019.

The Cover Design Of My Book - I’ll be designing something based on the design in the mockup, and consulting with a professional book artist. Ultimately, I'll be designing this mostly myself, so the cost won't be great, but I need advice from a professional. 

The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)

Copyediting For My Book - to help polish the grammar (which I really need) and spelling prior to publication, and to help make the book more interesting. 

Organizing And Structuring My Book - I'll need time to finish the final draft once changes are made and new sections are added. I will need the time, and additional finances will help me take a break from the studio and focus on the book and meet all my deadlines.

Proofing - I'll be going back and forth with the publisher and ordering several proofs. 

The Launch & Promotion Efforts For My Book - when I ultimately publish next winter.

Designing And Ordering Insert Materials - For all the additional digital cards and fun materials that will be included with your book.

Packaging Materials - In order to ship everything out in time, I'll have to preorder boxes and other packaging materials that can only be purchased in bulk.
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book via this campaign:
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish an early release on December 2nd.
You will receive the book before the official release date in February of 2020.
A personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book.
Your Name will appear in a Special Acknowledgements section of my book (“with Special Thanks To”).
Early access to the introduction of my book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback, before the official release date in February.
I will keep you up to date on the process at least once a week up until the early release of the book. I will stay in touch after the book release if you would like.
The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my final cover design. 
 Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is finding the time to organize, rewrite, and finish drafts.  It will be the back and forth between the publishers and myself that will take the most time, effort and money. I am hoping that we get enough pre-orders to give me the finances I need to be able to use that time and additional expense budget to work through any problems that may arise.Mailing the books on time will also be paramount and brings with it all kinds of challenges. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the packaging and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with Lulu Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. The plan is to have the books in my hands no later than November 30th, I will sign them and package myself and they should all ship out the following week.I will keep you up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship ahead of time.If I do not reach my goal, I will continue with the pre-release launch on December 2nd for the physical copy of the books, but the audiobook may be pushed back to the middle or end of December.  Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Twenty-One Years Young</i> is a collection of personal essays that examine the uncertainty, unpredictability, and beauty of growing up. This essay collection explores such subjects such as recovering from a near-death experience, debating politics at the dinner table, the value of rejection, and the significance of traveling alone. With honest, intimate, and vividly descriptive prose, twenty-one-year-young Amy Dong articulates how even the most unexpected moments of life can be meaningful because they are our own.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>My name is Amy Dong and I am the author of <i>Twenty-One Years Young</i>. I wrote this book to examine my life at this juncture between youth and adulthood. After living through so many things I could not foresee, I wanted to reflect on the moments that have shaped the person I have become and the person I may one day be.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover—or rediscover—the stories in your own life that have become an inescapable part of your narrative. With these essays, I hope to instill in you the same sort of curiosity I have in making sense of the confusing, untidy moments of life. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you reflect on the messy and intractable truths in your own life, and to question who you are in this moment, and why.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll explore a range of subjects that touch on everything from the significance of college admissions to the taking care of pets. In total, there are 13 essays along with a note from the author and an epilogue of sorts.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are someone who, like me, enjoys personal storytelling as a way to kickstart your own self-reflection. While these essays sketch out individual experiences, they resonate with universal feelings.<br/><br/><i>Twenty-One Years Young</i> is a nonfiction book that particularly speaks to young adults in their teens and 20s who are just beginning their search for a “purpose,” a “good life,” and a “career,” as well as parents who are looking for a reminder of what growing up truly entails.<br/> </p>

<h2><strong>The Story Bit</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Jackie Martin and I have trained in art teaching and children's counselling, working with creativity and play. Through my work with children and personal experience, I have seen the power of creativity on mental health. This book serves as a work-book and guide, utilising proven tools to enhance mindfulness and well-being. Each word helps us to be aware of our shared experience, enhancing our connection and compassion, then an exercise linked to that very word helps us to practice the very essence of it’s meaning in our daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>Found in Translation</strong> is an illustrated alphabet of words from different languages and cultures around the world, with my accompanying illustrations. Each of these words is untranslatable directly into English but describes a universal and relatable feeling of the human experience. The word then has an accompanying creative/therapeutic exercise linked to its philosophy. This helps to turn the lesson learnt from that word into positive action. In a world that has never felt more fragmented and complicated, the book captures the simple power of language to connect us. These words can, and do, provide solace and the reassurance that we are not alone.  I have selected them carefully from a broad spectrum of sources and they are mostly related to connection and belonging – to each other, to nature and, most profoundly, to ourselves.</p>
<p>Helping me to fund this book will mean such a great deal to me. It is the accumulation of over a year's hard work and soul searching and I really believe it deserves a place in the world!</p>
<h2><strong>The Money Bit</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<h3>I am looking to raise £2400 with this campaign (with your help)</h3>
<p>I have an offer to self publish but the costs will be as so:</p>
<ul>
<li>£850 for design, lay-out, registration and production of the book</li>
<li>£1330 for production of the first 300 (hardback) copies</li>
<li>(Up to) £220 for hosting and transfer fees for crowdfunding site</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a profit making initiative for me at all. This is literally just about getting the book out in to the world! If there is a surplus of funds at the end of this campaign (fees less than expected etc.) then this money will be donated to an appropriate charity of my choice. No money from this campaign not used for production and fees will be kept by me. I envisage up to and around 200 books being circulated to donors throughout this campaign, but I do, however, reserve the right to sell any leftover books for my profit.</p>
<p>As part of this, I am offering to donors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Mackie Illustrates card to say thank you to all donors</li>
<li>A hardback copy of the book for all donations of £15 or above</li>
<li>A hardback copy of the book and a Mackie Illustrates limited edition print for all donations of £25 or above</li>
</ul>
<p>Any support will be so, so gratefully received.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Cutting-Edge Arts, Fine Sciences</i> explores social innovations at the intersection of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) and the arts.</p>
<p>My name is Julie Yelle and I am the author of <i>Cutting-Edge Arts, Fine Sciences: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Social Innovation</i>. I wrote this book because great innovations with tangible social impact have arisen out of interdisciplinary collaborations, and people who have bridged the sciences and the arts in meaningful ways share approaches to their work and to life that are game-changing.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the sciences and the arts are mutually reinforcing partners in ways that you would never have imagined. In this book, I hope to instill the same passion and excitement that I have for connecting the dots in unexpected ways in you. Ultimately, I would like you to see this book as a tool to help you hold the keys to greater knowledge, creativity, and impact.</p>
<p>In this book, you will learn about real-life stories of intriguing cross-disciplinary innovations and the tangible inspiration they hold for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dancers who teamed up with scientists to communicate complex concepts to thousands of people</li>
<li>Doctors who discovered that Bolivian artisans held a technical secret to saving the lives of their own children</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs who harnessed digital technology to expand arts accessibility and redefine the artistic experience</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you care about creating and sharing knowledge, saving and improving lives, and learning about the universe and the people in it.</p>

<h3>The Book: Cutting-Edge Arts, Fine Sciences</h3>
<p>The book is written in three parts:</p>
<p>Part 1 contains the introduction and additional chapters. This section contains fascinating, real-life examples of recent innovations at the overlap of STEM subjects and the arts. You will encounter the stories of creative and courageous individuals who interwove the arts and the sciences in surprising and powerful ways.</p>
<p>Part 2 presents principles of innovation gleaned from these examples. In this section, you will discover the shared attitudes and behaviors that I unearthed from these examples to inform your own processes of innovation.</p>
<p>Part 3 offers suggestions and frameworks for cultivating your own intersections. You will learn how to identify and put to advantage your own cross-disciplinary intersections, whether to create a more fulfilling career or to advance the state of art in your existing area of focus.</p>

I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and is published. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.
Other Ways You Can Help


Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Be sure to use #artnsci and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my pre-sale campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please send a message about my book to five friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it.

Thank you so much of all of your encouragement and support!Thanks again,Julie Yelle",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Help Make My Book a Reality</h3>
I'm two steps from the finish line, but I need your help to get there. Four years ago I embarked on a project that involved traveling to four continents and observing peasants engaged in both industrial and organic agriculture. The question: Which was the best way to feed the world? The U.S. is trying to get Africans hooked on chemicals right now, but scientists say that organic agriculture could double Africa's food production in just 10 years.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've put well over $14,000 of my own money into this project and I've also peed outside, taken baths in buckets, slept in mud huts, scratched countless mosquito bites, and spent $2000 on rabies treatment after a dog bit me near Lake Titicaca. The book's mostly written, I've got a publisher and a book contract... but I can't finish without help.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Help Make My Book a Reality
I'm two steps from the finish line, but I need your help to get there. Four years ago I embarked on a project that involved traveling to four continents and observing peasants engaged in both industrial and organic agriculture. The question: Which was the best way to feed the world? The U.S. is trying to get Africans hooked on chemicals right now, but scientists say that organic agriculture could double Africa's food production in just 10 years.
 
I've put well over $14,000 of my own money into this project and I've also peed outside, taken baths in buckets, slept in mud huts, scratched countless mosquito bites, and spent $2000 on rabies treatment after a dog bit me near Lake Titicaca. The book's mostly written, I've got a publisher and a book contract... but I can't finish without help.

Thoughtful, inventive, and beautifully lyric, the novel masterfully challenges the persistent, corrupting, too-intimate obfuscations of state terror, its obscure motivations and rolls of the disappeared, with the liberating and illuminating transformations of art. Anca Cristofovici is a Romanian writer currently living in Paris.</p><p><strong><i>Armor, Amour</i> by Amy Pence</strong></p><p>""Amy Pence's second collection thrives on both contradiction and expansion. Her short works, comprising two-thirds of the poems in the book, fulfill Blake's call for 'Eternity in a grain of sand,' while the longer pieces--rangy, kinetic, meticulously shaped--follow Mallarme's throw of the dice into new and eye-opening frontiers. Pence's poetic world is simultaneously a 'Tender, small universe' and a 'red sac torn open,' and<i> Armor, Amour </i>forcefully captures these conversant facets of her imagination.""</p><p>         --Gregory Fraser, author of <i>Answering the Ruins</i></p><p><strong><i>Elegy for a Fabulous World </i>by Alta Ifland</strong></p><p>The surreal and darkly humorous stories of<i> Elegy for a Fabulous World</i> describe an eccentric family and their polyglot friends and neighbors--Ukrainians, Hungarians, Germans, Romanians, Gypsies, Jews, Russians--surviving together in a land where fable, reality, and State-issued lies are impossible to untangle. In the book's second section, the narratives emigrate to the United States, where the skepticism learned in fabulous youth infects and frustrates American attitudes and institutions. Real fictions of strange lands, Ifland's stories demonstrate a deep sympathy with the visionary outsider and a vital and provocative international point of view. Alta Ifland grew up in Eastern Europe and emigrated to the United States in 1991. <i>Elegy for a Fabulous World</i> was selected, from an extremely competitive field, as a finalist for the 2010 Northern California Book Awards.</p><p><i><strong>Deep Travel: Contemporary American Poets Abroad</strong></i> <strong>edited by Sandra Meek</strong></p><p><i>Travel</i>, winner of a 2008 Independent Publisher Book Award Gold Medal, brings together thirty-four contemporary American poets whose work has been significantly informed by international travel or by living abroad.

The Ocean Container is his first novel.The $2,500.00 to be raised here will support the initial expenses related to The Ocean Container's design and printing. Perks: If you donate $25-$49, you will receive one unsigned copy of ""The Ocean Container"" after its release. All donors of $25 and up will be listed on a special acknowledgements page in the book. For every $50 you donate, you will receive one signed copy of ""The Ocean Container"" after its release. This is our second crowd-funding campaign -- our first was to raise money to publish Anca Cristofovici's wonderful novel Stela. We are so thankful for your support and enthusiasm, and can't wait to see more of it for Patrik Sampler's fantastic new book! Ninebark Press is committed to publishing literature that crosses boundaries of genre, culture, and aesthetic, literature which is both intelligent and empathetic, as engaged in the art of language as it is concerned with human circumstance and the larger natural world, and particularly work which displays an international element. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to further our mission by introducing Patrik Sampler's remarkable novel to readers, and grateful for your help in accomplishing this.Thank you for your support!Sandra Meek, Michael Mejia, and Mindy Wilson,Ninebark Press Co-Founding EditorsNinebark Press Advisory Board:Sven BirkertsRikki DucornetAlice FrimanAlbert GoldbarthTayari JonesLaurence LiebermanMichael MartoneReginald McKnightLarissa Szporluk Why “ninebark”? The press takes its name from a genus of flowering bushes, Ninebark, itself named for the way its bark peels away in many layers. Ninebark occurs naturally both within and without the United States in many diverse and varied species. Both as natural object and as word, Ninebark suggests that complexity is not antithetical to beauty, but necessary to its creation.  Other Ninebark Press PublicationsStela by Anka CristofoviciAnca Cristofovici's Stela is the haunting record of the troubled dreamlife and developing creative spirit of a young dancer, Cora, struggling to dispel decades of speculation, half-truths, and informational gaps surrounding the official story of her mother's mysterious disappearance from the streets of an unnamed city in an unnamed country governed by a faceless repressive regime. Thoughtful, inventive, and beautifully lyric, the novel masterfully challenges the persistent, corrupting, too-intimate obfuscations of state terror, its obscure motivations and rolls of the disappeared, with the liberating and illuminating transformations of art. Anca Cristofovici is a Romanian writer currently living in Paris.Armor, Amour by Amy Pence""Amy Pence's second collection thrives on both contradiction and expansion. Her short works, comprising two-thirds of the poems in the book, fulfill Blake's call for 'Eternity in a grain of sand,' while the longer pieces--rangy, kinetic, meticulously shaped--follow Mallarme's throw of the dice into new and eye-opening frontiers. Pence's poetic world is simultaneously a 'Tender, small universe' and a 'red sac torn open,' and Armor, Amour forcefully captures these conversant facets of her imagination.""         --Gregory Fraser, author of Answering the RuinsElegy for a Fabulous World by Alta IflandThe surreal and darkly humorous stories of Elegy for a Fabulous World describe an eccentric family and their polyglot friends and neighbors--Ukrainians, Hungarians, Germans, Romanians, Gypsies, Jews, Russians--surviving together in a land where fable, reality, and State-issued lies are impossible to untangle. In the book's second section, the narratives emigrate to the United States, where the skepticism learned in fabulous youth infects and frustrates American attitudes and institutions. Real fictions of strange lands, Ifland's stories demonstrate a deep sympathy with the visionary outsider and a vital and provocative international point of view. Alta Ifland grew up in Eastern Europe and emigrated to the United States in 1991. Elegy for a Fabulous World was selected, from an extremely competitive field, as a finalist for the 2010 Northern California Book Awards.Deep Travel: Contemporary American Poets Abroad edited by Sandra MeekTravel, winner of a 2008 Independent Publisher Book Award Gold Medal, brings together thirty-four contemporary American poets whose work has been significantly informed by international travel or by living abroad. The book includes poems by Pulitzer Prize-winners as well as mid-career and emerging writers. Participating poets also contributed original prose statements on how travel has deepened their work, their understanding of poetry's aesthetic and human value, and their sense of self and ""Other."" Risks and challengesFor any small literary press, distribution is a challenge.

<p><b>THE WAY OF THE STORYTELLER</b></p>
<p>I'm a collector of stories. I'm a dreamer. I'm a storyteller. It's what I do. It's what I have always done. In my professional career, I am an editor and writer for lifestyle magazines. But it's more than that, I walk the way of the storyteller. It's the path I've chosen, and it's the path that's chosen me. As a person with narcolepsy I live in two worlds, waking reality and the dream realm. What I experience in the dream world is as vivid and relevant as my waking life.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why I have always loved stories, in all forms. I have a deep appreciation for the role that storytelling has played in our world, from when we were first etching pictographs on cave walls to this postmodern era, where a new form of pictographing – social media – expands our storytelling capacity to a fantastic degree. I marvel at technology that gives us infinite opportunity to explore the far corners of the planet and to not only walk in the shoes of others, but to learn how those shoes were made, even to buy those shoes, or help the shoemaker create a business to support her family.  </p>
<p>Words matter: the words we choose and how we convey them can profoundly impact our own lives and those of others. Stories can inspire us to be our best selves and compel us to action. Stories allow us to bear witness, to experience our individuality and our commonality.</p>
<p>(You can find out more about me and about my work history, read samples of published work, listen to some of my spoken songs, and more on my website <a href=""https://www.onelindablack.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.onelindablack.com</a>)</p>

<p>MY ""DREAM OF DRAGONS"" WORK SPACE</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY NARCOLEPSY IS AWESOME</strong></p>
<p>I'm inclined to think that in ancient times, a narcoleptic would have been the shaman of the tribe. When we sleep, we go to the proverbial mountain: We watch, we witness, we experience, and we bring it back to waking reality.</p>
<p>My personal journey has been a magic carpet ride through both the physical world and the other worlds. Dream of Dragons, Memoir of a Narcoleptic<i> is</i> a memoir, but it reads like fiction, as I weave my two lives the way I experience them, as a constant and symbiotic overlapping.  </p>
<p>For me, being a person with narcolepsy is intrinsic to walking the way of the storyteller. Being adventuresome in my dream life empowers me to be adventuresome in my waking life. For example, when I bought a one-way ticket to the US Virgin Islands, where I landed a job as an assistant editor for <i>Portside</i>, a niche magazine that explored the unusual lives and myriad jobs of the crew of cruise ships. And when I found myself performing poetry on the floor of a UN General Assembly. And my journey as a single mom, where my two driving instincts were to instill in my daughter the knowing that she is loved ""everywhere and all the time,"" and that her home is within her so she can be at home wherever she is on the planet. (I'll take you on all of these journeys, and more, in my memoir.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>WHY NARCOLEPSY ISN'T AWESOME</strong>   </p>
<p>I don't think of myself as having a disability or handicap, I don't even think of myself as ""having narcolepsy,"" it is simply my way of being in the world. But narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease, and there are very real symptoms that do impact how I navigate life. I can't have a driver's license, for example. It was revoked when I was 25. </p>
<p>The symptoms tend to amplify as we get older – sudden sleep spells, excessive daytime sleepiness, chronic insomnia at night, cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle control), and hypnagognic hallucinations, which can be terrifying, as demons and monsters from the dream realm get a foothold in waking reality. And I simply cannot stay awake for eight hours straight, or even four.</p>
<p>I am creative and productive, but only when I work from home, where I can work when I am most alert (often at night) and where I can take frequent breaks and naps and the occasional DSD. (DSD = Dedicated Sleep Day.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE NARCOLEPSY?</strong></p>
<p>If you think you might have narcolepsy, please check out the Narcolepsy Network's website to get more information and make connections: <a href=""https://www.narcolepsynetwork.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.narcolepsynetwork.org</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP</strong></p>
<p>I've been working part time on my book (and a follow up trilogy you can read about on my website) for about a year. With my Indiegogo campaign funds, I will be able to cut my freelance work back to part time, and give my full attention for at least three months to writing the book. I promise you, the book will be published, and that will happen a lot sooner with your help. If I don't reach my campaign goal, I will still work full time on the book until the funds run out. My long term goal is to do what I do best, write stories, to transition to being a full time writer of books. I've already outline a fictional trilogy based on a character from my dream world, and I've begun to write the first book in the series, Remember the Sun. (Go to my Dream of Dragons page on my website to read an excerpt.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SOME TANGIBLE THANK YOUS FOR YOUR SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p>I'm offering gifts that come from waking life and dreams, like my spoken songs CDs. Sometimes in the dream world, I'm an observer, and sometimes I'm a fully immersed and active participant. (I am something of a superhero, I can fly, I can move through matter, furniture, walls, even entire buildings. I can shoot fire from my fingertips!) You can check out one of my spoken songs from The Revolution CD. It's called Rememberin' You, and it's from a dream where I witnessed an old woman recalling the love of her life: <a href=""https://www.soundcloud.com/user-938038790/rememberin-you"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/user-938038790/rememberin-you</a>.</p>
<p>In my experience, from attending annual Narcolepsy Network conferences (shout out to all my sleepy friends!) people with narcolepsy tend to be highly creative, which makes sense, given our extraordinary dream lives and our easy access to the ""other worlds."" Just recently, I started painting stemware and I'm excited to offer you my Dream of Dragons collection! I'll be hand painting every single piece, so it will be one-of-a-kind. And every time you use it, your beer glass, or wine carafe, or wine glass, you can feel good about supporting a hard-working writer and artist.</p>
<p>I'll be adding some perks along the way, as my campaign rolls along, and I welcome your suggestions! </p>

<p>$150 DREAM STORY ONLINE WORKSHOP</p>
<p>If you choose one of the larger-contribution perks that have to do with my Dream Story Workshop, we will get to work one-on-one! (The online workshop includes two half-hour Skype sessions.) I believe the old adage that ""everyone has a story"" doesn't quite cover it. I believe we all have many stories, and it can only serve our wellbeing to share our stories, to write them, to speak them, and to give the gift of listening to others. That's what my workshops are about. I hope I get the chance to swap stories with you. </p>
<p>I believe my book, this fiction/fantasy–like personal journey, will just be a darn good read for anyone. And hopefully, it will be inspirational too. For people with narcolepsy, of course, but anyone who has a different way of being in the world, anyone who has challenges navigating a nine-to-five life, anyone who chooses to live out-of-the-box – and anyone who doesn't have a choice, whose circumstances dictate an out-of-the-box existence, anyone who lives with a credo to take it on, whatever it is, to work through it, to move through grief and loss, to find beauty amidst our hardships and challenges, to dream big!</p>
<p>That's the kind of thinking that led me to launch a world-culture, arts, and lifestyle magazine called AVALON, with my sister Lorie. (You can check it out on my website.) We published it for three years, and it was on shelves in Chapters bookstores in Canada and Barnes &amp; Noble in the US, as well as many independent booksellers in both countries. The mission was to celebrate humanity by sharing stories about people and organizations who are bettering the world – by their philanthropy or their leadership in community, by their art or their craftsmanship, by their innovative approach to living or how they've moved through a hardship. (The story of how we launched a magazine will be in my memoir.) The AVALON motto, <i>reflecting the everyday lives we lead and the extraordinary lives we dream, </i>speaks to the Dream of Dragons project too, how it's about the extraordinary aspects of everyday life.   </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>BUMPS IN THE ROAD</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge for Dream of Dragons is not in the writing of it, it will be written! The challenge will be the road to publication. I will try to go the traditional route, which is publication through an established publishing house. I have a published writer friend, who has generously offered to make the intro to her publisher, so that's a big foot in the door. But if that doesn't pan out, the next step will be to engage an agent who can make those connections and outreaches to publishing houses on my behalf. There is also the self-publishing option, which I have experience in through publishing AVALON, and which I will explore as well. Either way, the book will be published. My hope is that it will be a relatively smooth process, and with your support that's a lot more likely. </p>

<p><i><strong>""What Is This Project And Why Should I Give A Damn?""</strong></i></p>
<p><strong><i>TLDR; </i></strong><i>We don’t want our children blindsided like we were, <strong>so </strong>we are making difficult things accessible</i><strong><i> and </i></strong><i>removing the need for a college degree or hours of googling to understand gender and sexuality.</i></p>
<p><u><strong>The Issue is Systemic</strong></u></p>
<p>During this tumultuous period in history, an understanding of systems of oppression, identity, and politics has become essential in societal navigation. As generations of children are brought up, times keep changing, and the level of youth engagement and political understanding has experienced a significant increase. Out of necessity, our youth has realized that no one is too young to unlearn society’s flawed concepts and fight against its harmful systemic issues. In fact, if we as a people want to survive, arming our children with knowledge, understanding, and self-awareness is one of the best things we can do for ourselves.</p>
<u><strong>Why for kids?</strong></u><p>This project is (in the long run) a series of books aimed at children, toddlers, and teens to help along this process. An easy-to-use, “ABC” format presents difficult concepts and identities in an accessible and straightforward way so that anyone can begin their journey towards self-discovery and compassionate understanding without the need to be a social justice activist or a university educated student.</p> <u><strong>Why Should Adults Care?</strong></u><p>It is important that parents, guardians, and adults find better ways to engage with children earlier on so that the next generation is prepared with the knowledge they need to shape the future of our world and theirs. Systemic oppression runs deep, and the sooner we educate our children in how to identify injustice, prejudice, and corruption, the less likely they are of perpetuating the toxic ideologies that are currently contributing to the extreme decline in mental health, the violence plaguing our governmental policies and day-to-day life, and the overall lack of compassion in favor of capitalistic gain.</p>

<p><i><strong>“I Don’t Want To Talk to My Child About Sex. They Are Too Young.”</strong></i></p>
<p>Though many believe sheltering children from their sexuality for as long as possible keeps them from engaging in sex before they (or adults) are ready for it, the earlier a child is introduced to concepts of sexual identity, the better. Because even though they may not be ready to engage in sex yet, it doesn’t keep them from experiencing sexual feelings. More importantly, it doesn’t shelter them from homophobia, transphobia, gender dysphoria, and years of self-hate and confusion. Refusing to talk about sexuality merely leaves them defenseless while they are figuring out who they are. Utilizing the ABC format paired with striking images, we are seeking to create an educational resource that is accessible to a child’s mind, while still approaching the harder issues their parents either might not know how to approach or can use as a conversation starter.</p> <p> </p>

TLDR; We don’t want our children blindsided like we were, so we are making difficult things accessible and removing the need for a college degree or hours of googling to understand gender and sexuality.
The Issue is Systemic
During this tumultuous period in history, an understanding of systems of oppression, identity, and politics has become essential in societal navigation. As generations of children are brought up, times keep changing, and the level of youth engagement and political understanding has experienced a significant increase. Out of necessity, our youth has realized that no one is too young to unlearn society’s flawed concepts and fight against its harmful systemic issues. In fact, if we as a people want to survive, arming our children with knowledge, understanding, and self-awareness is one of the best things we can do for ourselves.
Why for kids?This project is (in the long run) a series of books aimed at children, toddlers, and teens to help along this process. An easy-to-use, “ABC” format presents difficult concepts and identities in an accessible and straightforward way so that anyone can begin their journey towards self-discovery and compassionate understanding without the need to be a social justice activist or a university educated student. Why Should Adults Care?It is important that parents, guardians, and adults find better ways to engage with children earlier on so that the next generation is prepared with the knowledge they need to shape the future of our world and theirs. Systemic oppression runs deep, and the sooner we educate our children in how to identify injustice, prejudice, and corruption, the less likely they are of perpetuating the toxic ideologies that are currently contributing to the extreme decline in mental health, the violence plaguing our governmental policies and day-to-day life, and the overall lack of compassion in favor of capitalistic gain.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is it about?</strong></p>
<p>“Ergo Sum” is a novel inspired by the brain. We are not who, or what, we think we are. Our subconscious mind makes our decisions before we are consciously aware of them. What if we could put our bodies and minds on autopilot, and become better at being ourselves than we ever imagined? Faster, smarter, more creative. What would it mean for society?</p>
<p>Vincent Thorndike is a former human test subject who knows this better than anyone else. He shares his mind with his augmented sub-consciousness: the Sleepwalker. Together, they wage a one-man campaign of industrial espionage against the corrupt government and ruthless corporations of New Columbia. However, Vincent begins to find other survivors of similar experiments: a man-child who sees killing as play, a cannibalistic serial killer without consciousness and a genius intellect, and a woman with an artificial intelligence jammed into her head. Together, they are drawn into a sinister plan to forever alter the human mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is your audience? </strong></p>
<p>This book will appeal to people interested in neuroscience, guerrilla warfare, techno-thrillers, and philosophy. What happens if key assumptions in philosophy and society turn out to be wrong? If society fails, who can you really fall back on? Where does neurochemistry end and personality begin? If you liked Peter Watts’ “Blindsight,” the “Deus Ex” games, or “Ghost in the Shell,” you’ll love this. There are unique characters, fast action, and science that’s stranger than fiction. You can learn about neuroscience, sociology, weapons, and bleeding-edge gadgets based on real science and innovations. This novel will be accessible to the layman, hopefully stir get people asking questions about who they really are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been writing for a decade. I’ve studied neuroscience at a graduate level for four years, and I’m an avid shooter and martial artist. Writing this novel was a real treat, because I could combine many of my favourite interests together.  One thing I’ve always had interest in is unconventional tactics, like how a smaller foe can defeat a stronger one. Both a martial artist and a guerrilla fighter try to use an enemy’s strength against them, which is one of the major themes in this book. Our brain chemistry changes in life or death situations, and our response can determine if we survive or not.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Ever since battling and ultimately surviving Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma of Bone, a rare form of blood cancer, in 2006 I have been on a campaign of giving back.  My means are my music and performances.  My desire is for young adult patients to see and hear someone just like themselves...someone with a similar story who they can relate to.  My aim is to help alleviate the overwhelming sense of isolation naturally associated with such a traumatic experience, something I experienced first hand for two years post treatment.  My goal is to raise awareness about how paralyzing an effect this can have for a young adult survivor during treatment and in the first few years of remission. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>During my 8 months of intense chemotherapy, it was my passion for Hip Hop and creative lyricism which I attribute to actually saving my life.  While being treated I wrote, produced and recorded a ten song Hip Hop album called ""Cancerous Flow : Lyrical Journal"" which has been pressed up in the thousands and donated to teen and young adult Cancer patients and survivors across the country.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I am now 5 years into remission and in that time have become heavily involved in the young adult survivor community.  In the past five years I've attended a number of large events and conferences at which I perform, tell my story and provide copies of ""Cancerous Flow"" for attendees.  Among the most frequent comments I hear is, ""Wow, you have such an inspirational story, its too bad I hate rap.""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In response I've undertaken the writing of ""Cancerous Flow : Lyrical Memoir"".  Planned to be ten chapters in length with a prologue and epilogue and between 150 -200 pages in length, this project is uncensored, brutally honest and vividly raw while at the same time being funny, heart warming and joyous.  It is as much a story about Hip Hop and the vital role it played in my survival as it is about the disease itself.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When you think of Cancer the first two images most likely to pop into your head either of a young child or someone in the age range of a grandparent.  Rarely ever  do people think of the young adult, 16-35 in age.  Those in that age group are often lost in the shuffle, and most often endure their treatment among those vastly older or younger than themselves.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Hip Hop music and culture has the potential to bind people of different generations and backgrounds.  It can be considered the voice of today's urban youth and has long since expanded its reach beyond the inner city to encompass the entire planet. My story is told in that voice and from my perspective as an independent and, as of yet unsigned, emcee of ten years at the time. Exhibiting Hip Hop as it really is, a culture born out of the struggle for survival against all odds, this story is about conquering insurmountable obstacles.  It is about a life saved and a life long dream come true.  ""Cancerous Flow : Lyrical Memoir"" tells the story of an underdog determined to persevere at all costs. <br/></p>

This book, my fifth, is like GPS for your evolving soul and the creative energy you can access. My wish is that my readers will gain insight into the vast changes happening to each of us, be empowered with knowledge and have a heightened sense of control along with an absence of fear in their daily lives. </h3>
<p><strong>Your Creative Soul</strong> is completed and ready to be published. This is where I need your help. I need to raise money to get this book out into the world -- to cover editing, book design, cover design (the publisher already did this on good faith so that you could see it), lay-out, printing and marketing. I’ve created a rewards program that I hope you will find equitable. (Fairness is important to me.) One of the most exciting of my rewards is a limited edition, inscribed and signed hard cover copy for donors at the $250 level and up. Because of the high quality of printing done by Gather Insight, the retail price of their paperback books is higher than average. But their books are well worth it. This is the reason that paper back copies are given at the $50 level while lower amounts receive the e copy. The content is, of course, priceless. My gratitude to any donor is endless. If you want additional copies to give as gifts, please make separate donations.</p>
<p>Since I opened my healing practice over two decades ago, I have placed all client payments into a special heart for blessing before I deposit those checks into my bank account.  I will make a list of everyone who donates to making this book a published reality and place it into that heart for daily blessings and the intention that this money be returned to you at least ten-fold. Your name will remain in the blessing heart for a full year. All other rewards are scheduled to be fulfilled by December 31, 2012. The publisher expects this book to be picked up by a bigger house. When that happens, those names in the acknowledgements section from this campaign will stay with the book. </p>
<p><strong>Getting Published</strong></p>
<p>I’ve jumped through hoops with other publishing houses, being challenged to maintain my integrity to my work while editors tried to make my writing into what they wanted. That’s just the nature of publishing. With <strong>Your Creative Soul</strong>, I will have an entirely different experience. It will be published by an amazing small press, Gather Insight. Their books contain full, multi-colored graphics that enliven and enlighten the printed word. I don’t know of any other publisher that takes this kind of care to produce a product that is so totally engaging.</p>
<p>Their publishing program is a breath of fresh air! The authors have professional and passionate assistance with publishing and distribution while retaining the rights to their work. And we have the final say on what is published. Doing this, though, requires that the authors fund the printing.  I need money to get the project going. It’s not that much by publishing standards but a lot by my bank account’s condition.</p>
<p>The publishers believe that this book needs to be available to the public as quickly as possible, so we are looking at releasing it as early as August and as late as October of this year. They also believe that because the information in the book is both new and timely, that it will rapidly gain in popularity. I broke new ground with my first book, <strong>The Woman’s Book of Creativity</strong>, and I’m presenting more new information and concepts in <strong>Your Creative Soul</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>More Information about the Book</strong></p>
<p>Some of the key elements discussed in <strong>Your Creative Soul</strong> are the nature of change and how it has changed, HA-HA as a pathway to AHA as a pathway to AWE, reasons for celebrating being a misfit (we’re <strong><em>really</em></strong> creative). I offer a completely new perspective on the human psyche and what it is becoming as we collectively integrate our divinity and humanity while we purposefully adapt. <br/><br/>Creativity is an inherent part of being human and accessing our soul creativity puts us into a powerful, fun relationship with everything. </p>
<p>I believe that spirituality, creativity and humor nurture each other, so I write with humor. Not necessarily something you would expect in a spirituality or creativity book, but I thought I ought to give you a heads-up about that! When you get your copy of <strong>Your Creative Soul</strong>, you can expect an enjoyable, eye-opening, life-changing reading experience.</p>
<p><strong>More About Me</strong></p>
<p>I’ve written all sorts of things since I learned how to put words together, but writing about me is the hardest! I think you ought to know that I am academically qualified to write this book. I have a Ph.D. in Behavioral Science – my dissertation research was on the feminine creative process, an area that had never been studied! My M.S. is in Communication and my B.S. is in Speech. I was recognized as the wittiest girl in my high school graduation class – still love that one!</p>
<p>I am a teacher by nature and love to give speeches and conduct presentations. I’ve done hundreds of them over the years both throughout the USA and abroad. I’ve worked in management positions in both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors. I like being self-employed the best.</p>
<p>In my family of origin, both creativity and humor were highly valued. I’ve been a spiritual seeker since I was a teenager, inspired by my mother’s sage advice: never confuse religion with spirituality.</p>
<p>Along with being a writer, I am also an energy healer. In the late ‘80s I developed a new energy healing modality I call Physiohelanics™. I’ve conducted thousands of sessions over the years and have taught it to others. That way, I finally got to have my own healing session! Physiohelanics is featured in <strong>The Encyclopedia of Energy Medicine</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Your Creative Soul</strong> will not be my last book. I love writing as much as presenting and plan to do both until I am ready to leave. I am owned by three cats and I’m a Phi Mu.</p>

My idea to write a children's counting book came about from my many years of teaching high school science. I found that there was a sharp decline in the academic performance of high school students from grade 7 to grade 10. The reason most often given to said decline is a general lack of interest in the subject. The truth is that most students coming into high school have a very limited knowledge of science which is undoubtedly a contributing factor to their lack of interest. My idea is to instill some knowledge and interest in science to children when they are learning their ABC's and 123's. It stands to reason that if they are introduced to science early on they may develop a genuine and lasting interest in science.<p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/296577/files/20140107152724-nedcovernew.JPG?1389137244"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/296591/files/20140107153254-ned_1__1_.jpg?1389137574"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/296592/files/20140107153308-ned_1_2_.jpg?1389137588"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p>

<h3>With only 6 days left, I need a lot of help still. T-shirts are awesome, right? Anyone at the $100 level (already contributed or about to) will also get a Khaos Theory t-shirt or tank sent to them as part of their thank you. Yea. I thought you'd like that.</h3>
<h3>Who and What is Khaos Theory??</h3>
<p>My name is Merry Khaos. In the real world I am Kristie Grey. I am a roller derby skater, author, coach, enthusiast, promoter and more. My life is roller derby, and I love increasing my skills and spreading my knowledge. I have been skating for almost three years.</p>
<p>I have guest skated with Gotham Girls, Philly, Charm City, Molly Rogers, Mason Dixon, Arizona, Lehigh Valley, Jerzey Derby and the Roller Radicals. I have coached at Black Rose and Susquehanna Valley. I will be teaching at Rollercon 2012. I have been writing and commentating on roller derby for over a year. I have been a student of athletics for almost 14 years in sports such as kickboxing, rock climbing, softball, racquetball, pole-vaulting and stage combat (yes that's a sport).</p>
<p>I am currently writing a training guide for roller derby skaters that gives an encompassing knowledge of fundamentals, gear, fitness programs, skill advancement, nutrition and self-assessment. I am using several training guides from other sports as my framework, and have been collecting information and sources for over two years to be sure that information is comprehensive and correct.</p>
<p>This campaign will not only help me publish the book, but it will give me the financial backing to actually piece it together with editing and artwork. The sooner this book is completed, the sooner derby girls around the world can have an extra guide to help them in their own quest for personal acheivement.</p>
<p>Check out the video to see some of my teaching style.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get Out of It!</h3>
<div>
<p>I need funding for writing, editing, photo rights and to find a publisher. If I cannot find a publisher, I will self-publish, which means I need the money to invest into paper copies.</p>
<p>Without funding, this project is going to take much longer to complete, and the longer it takes the longer everyone has to wait to get the compiled information.</p>
<p>Honestly, the goal SHOULD be $1000 minimum, but I do not want to be disappointed if we do not reach that goal. The money will go into the compilation and editing of the book first, publishing second and everything else will fall in after that. I have to prioritize of course!</p>
<p>Some perks that you get?? How about a copy of the book? Maybe some swag from my sponsor, As the Bearing Turns? Maybe some collector bout programs and wheels signed by some of the world's best skaters? Definitely a THANK YOU in the book and on my Derby America blog!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Should You Care?</h3>
<p>Roller derby is the fastest growing sport in the world. A book like this, which spans flat track, bank track, men's and women's derby will have a mass following. Every skater is looking for another way to improve. There is no perfection in derby. A book that can help a skater tot as well as a seasoned veteran will be exceptionally valuable.</p>
<p>You should care because a lot of people will find real value in themselves because of the confidence a book of this nature can give them. The motivation to improve and be healthy is something that not everyone has in their every day life. This book can help.</p>
<p>My editorals and blogs have been widely followed and praised by the everyday derby folk. I know that Khaos Theory could be just as inspirational and have an even larger following.</p>
Aside from all that, I am so passionate about spreading the knowledge I can collect. I want to help anyone that will listen.</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Elders have shared that Water has its own life force, that rivers and streams are the arteries and veins of Mother Earth, and that the oceans are the sacred mat that links all of Life. We know that Water is necessary for the health of all people, plants and animals. Yet, half of all Mother Earth’s lakes and rivers are polluted. And billions of people live without access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation. Many of these communities are indigenous. Even in Canada –a ‘developed’ country- 1/6 of indigenous communities do not have access to safe, clean drinking water.</p>
<p>Despite our proven sustainable cultural practices that respect and honor the natural environment, the lived experiences of our communities are overlooked. In many policies and strategies for action, the scientific world is looked to for both water policy development and climate change strategies. As original caretakers and guardians of Mother Earth, we have valuable insights for sustainable water practices that could inform and suggest alternatives to current water management and governance systems.</p>

What We Need and What You Get
We need $10.000 US Dollars to cover the cost of publishing the Anthology, print the posters and t-shirts and, furthermore, to fulfill our mandate so as to send out the books and perks.
With your help, the project will be divided like this:

We will send at least 6 complimentary books for each of the 60 authors/artists in the compilation.
We will also give books to the special guests of the forum in 2014.
We will send the books out to the applicable funders around the world.
And any remaining books will be sold independently. Any profit is intended to support the Indigenous World Forum on Water and Peace of 2014.

NB: The PERKS, on the right side of your screen, offer different possibilities to obtain the book and/or to be involved in this collective publication!
 
The Impact
Elders have shared that Water has its own life force, that rivers and streams are the arteries and veins of Mother Earth, and that the oceans are the sacred mat that links all of Life. We know that Water is necessary for the health of all people, plants and animals. Yet, half of all Mother Earth’s lakes and rivers are polluted. And billions of people live without access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation. Many of these communities are indigenous. Even in Canada –a ‘developed’ country- 1/6 of indigenous communities do not have access to safe, clean drinking water.
Despite our proven sustainable cultural practices that respect and honor the natural environment, the lived experiences of our communities are overlooked. In many policies and strategies for action, the scientific world is looked to for both water policy development and climate change strategies. As original caretakers and guardians of Mother Earth, we have valuable insights for sustainable water practices that could inform and suggest alternatives to current water management and governance systems.

<p><br/><br/>This is Emmanuel Vega. I'm an independent musician at the underground scene in Mexico.</p>
<p>Recently I finished to write what would be my very first novel. It's called <strong>""Mylan and the Ghost's Queen""</strong>. Its an kids/young people novel. And it has been picked up by one of the most important publishing houses in Mexico.</p>
<p>The story involves a boy, who has been waiting to live what he calls ""a truthful adventure"" to prove himself. Suddenly after some unexpected circumnstances, he's tasked  by the Ghost's Queen to save the ""Ghost Kingdom"" from a terrible invasion. </p>
<p>In order to publish the novel's first edition, they need the author to finance the printing services just for the first time. It costs roughly <strong>5500 dolars</strong>. But<strong> I only ask for 5000</strong> on this campaing. You can donate any amount you want. And even if we don't achieve the required quantity, <strong>all the funds will go to finance what they can for the book.</strong></p>

<p>As a giveaway, to all the donors and depending of the amount donated, I'll give to you an autographed copy of the book before everyone can get one. Or, a copy of the book and an ""soundtrack"" of the book, with music inspired on it, composed by myself.</p>

This is Emmanuel Vega. I'm an independent musician at the underground scene in Mexico.
Recently I finished to write what would be my very first novel. It's called ""Mylan and the Ghost's Queen"". Its an kids/young people novel. And it has been picked up by one of the most important publishing houses in Mexico.
The story involves a boy, who has been waiting to live what he calls ""a truthful adventure"" to prove himself. Suddenly after some unexpected circumnstances, he's tasked  by the Ghost's Queen to save the ""Ghost Kingdom"" from a terrible invasion. 
In order to publish the novel's first edition, they need the author to finance the printing services just for the first time. It costs roughly 5500 dolars. But I only ask for 5000 on this campaing. You can donate any amount you want. And even if we don't achieve the required quantity, all the funds will go to finance what they can for the book.

 
As a giveaway, to all the donors and depending of the amount donated, I'll give to you an autographed copy of the book before everyone can get one. Or, a copy of the book and an ""soundtrack"" of the book, with music inspired on it, composed by myself.
In case you're not able to donate, you can visit my musical project website: http://www.mq-03.com. And buy any of our CD's or donate with the ""Paypal"" button there. All the money we'll get that way (from now on until October 4th.) will be used to finance the book.
There are many brilliant writers around the world, whom are waiting to impress any reader with their stories. I believe I can take you to an exciting and different adventure throught my novel. I'm asking you the chance to impress you with a new story.
From now, I want to thank you to all of you out there. Thanks again and wish me luck!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

'DEPARTED'  the modernist issue 12, the last of our 'D' issues
The  magazine is about to enter its fourth year. Each issue theme begins with 'E' and we're starting year four with 'EXPO'.



(this image is derived from an archival book cover and is for illustrative purposes only to express the spirit of Expo - it is not indicative of our new design)
Twelve issues after our launch in 2011, we think its time to get a bit bigger and better - with more pages, more colour and a brand new design. An upscaled magazine is going to cost us a bit more money but the funding is straightforward - if more people buy it, we can print it. Its as simple as that.

We can't do it without you! The Modernist is a voluntary project and depends entirely on you, our loyal band of international Modernists, to keep us printing. Our only money is the money that you provide by buying and subscribing to the magazine.

They worked on the story together till Lewis' death in 2003, and finally the first series that they wrote together has been completed. Using Indiegogo they were able to get a great start with The Rise of Shendoa, the opening to the story, and this project is all about creating access to the entire series with the simultaneous release of the four sequels!</p>
<p>This story takes ownership of gargoyles as the main protagonists, and unfolds every detail of their culture. Saul Rip and Lewis Clark created an eclectic mixture of Greek mythology, Native American lore, and flavors of India to influence them in the development of the story. The series follows a family of gargoyles in one of the most unique stories of good vs. evil that you will ever find.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This project is Saul's life's work. he has dedicated the majority of his time for the last ten years to polishing it just for you. It is his passion project to say the least, and in truth, he has been borderline obsessive to get this finished for far too long!</span></p>
<p>In addition to working on his craft and refining his skills as a writer, he has also worked very hard to become a capable artist so that he could do all of the artwork associated with the books. The Rise of Shendoa has 104 original illustrations made to enhance the story, and between the four sequels, there are 140 original illustrations. We hope you love them!</p>
<p>With that said, this project will run similar to the previous one, meaning Saul will be offering a tremendous amount of original artwork to YOU as perks and rewards in addition to the books. We know you will love the books, and we are confident that you will love any of the original artwork that you receive by backing this project! </p>
<p>We are very grateful to be using this platform again, and we are thrilled to have you along as a partner on this remarkable journey. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $1,000 for this project!</p> <ul> <li>The funding for this project will go directly to marketing the story to get the word out on the amazing world that has been created in this book series. </li> <li>What you get out of this is what is the most exciting. Not only will you be able to choose between any or all of the seven books in the series, you will be able to choose between a large variety of artwork generated by author/artist Saul Rip! There is enough variety in the artwork that you can select something perfect for a souvenir or gift, an accent piece, or a masterful centerpiece perfect for your home! </li> <li>If we don't reach our entire goal, whatever we make will go towards compensating the artists that worked so hard to make this project a success. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Perks!</h3>

<div><h3>The Impact</h3></div> <p>Saul Rip wrote this story as a tribute to his best friend, but he also wrote it with the goal to use it as a tool to do good in the world. Saul has two passions, writing and architecture. It is Saul's hope that the extended impact of this story will create an enabler to doing other good and impressive things in the world. In addition to working on this story for the rest of his life, Saul is committed to using his talents and resources to solve challenges in the housing industry by providing alternative housing options: </p> <ul> <li>The time will come that these books generate enough income to fund awesome humanitarian projects. By backing this project you can contribute to helping that happen faster, as well as getting to place another sweet book series in your personal library.

They worked on the story together till Lewis' death in 2003, and finally the first series that they wrote together has been completed. Using Indiegogo they were able to get a great start with The Rise of Shendoa, the opening to the story, and this project is all about creating access to the entire series with the simultaneous release of the four sequels!
This story takes ownership of gargoyles as the main protagonists, and unfolds every detail of their culture. Saul Rip and Lewis Clark created an eclectic mixture of Greek mythology, Native American lore, and flavors of India to influence them in the development of the story. The series follows a family of gargoyles in one of the most unique stories of good vs. evil that you will ever find.
This project is Saul's life's work. he has dedicated the majority of his time for the last ten years to polishing it just for you. It is his passion project to say the least, and in truth, he has been borderline obsessive to get this finished for far too long!
In addition to working on his craft and refining his skills as a writer, he has also worked very hard to become a capable artist so that he could do all of the artwork associated with the books. The Rise of Shendoa has 104 original illustrations made to enhance the story, and between the four sequels, there are 140 original illustrations. We hope you love them!
With that said, this project will run similar to the previous one, meaning Saul will be offering a tremendous amount of original artwork to YOU as perks and rewards in addition to the books. We know you will love the books, and we are confident that you will love any of the original artwork that you receive by backing this project! 
We are very grateful to be using this platform again, and we are thrilled to have you along as a partner on this remarkable journey.    What We Need & What You Get We need $1,000 for this project!  The funding for this project will go directly to marketing the story to get the word out on the amazing world that has been created in this book series.  What you get out of this is what is the most exciting. Not only will you be able to choose between any or all of the seven books in the series, you will be able to choose between a large variety of artwork generated by author/artist Saul Rip! There is enough variety in the artwork that you can select something perfect for a souvenir or gift, an accent piece, or a masterful centerpiece perfect for your home!  If we don't reach our entire goal, whatever we make will go towards compensating the artists that worked so hard to make this project a success.     The Perks!

He began designing at the age of sixteen, and over the following decades continued his creative development in multiple realms, ranging from painting and photography to education and writing—but his greatest legacy is in graphic design, a stature cemented by the specimens of his many Nebiolo typefaces.</p><p>His type designs are still highly influential, and remain a valid starting point for the development of contemporary work. Therefore, the centenary of his birth—June 29, 2020—is the ideal occasion to celebrate his inestimable contribution to the discipline by reprinting <i>Alfa-Beta</i>, his landmark 1964 book on the history of writing systems and the evolution of type.</p><p> </p><h3>

The first edition was published in 1964 by Progresso Grafico and distributed by G.B. Paravia &amp; C. The book showcases a very specific point of view: it is one of very few works on the history of type originally written in Italian, and one of even fewer to have been written by a type designer rather than a historian or academic. It also marked the public debut of Novarese’s own typeface classification system. </p><p>Aldo Novarese, who became director of Nebiolo’s in-house design studio in 1952, conceived of it as an overview of his in-depth historical study of letterforms and type design. Inspired by his teaching experience at Turin’s Vigliardi Paravia school, as well as annual gatherings in Lure, his introduction expressly describes it as an educational work—essentially a textbook—and in the text itself he captures the rich complexity of type design as an ever-changing discipline.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595928811/ow0gi3jzlsxm7qts0hgc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The chapters proceed in chronological order, but the way their contents are presented gradually moves from a spare outline of historical facts to a more vibrant narrative, increasingly conveyed through plates and illustrations presenting a vast variety of visuals. Its span encompasses the earliest forms of writing to the most contemporary character sets, culminating with the most recent and innovative type designs—including Eurostile, released by Nebiolo just two years prior. The entire book is dotted with intriguing tables charting the development of calligraphic styles and typographical characters, often selected from Novarese’s own designs.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595928855/himpo1swptzhsjsddqrk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Despite Nebiolo’s support of the broader work, the book itself was clearly produced independently: the company is never explicitly mentioned by name, and the text is set (probably for both proprietary as well as technical reasons) in Simoncini Linotype typefaces. The first edition was printed in tri-tone letterpress, set in Linotype, illustrated by polymer plate, bound in hardcover, and came with a laminated dust-jacket.</p><p> </p><h3>Praise for <i>Alfa-Beta</i>
</h3><p> </p><p>""I do not know enough about Italian type design. Our world has been so dominated by Anglo-American influences since the 70s, mostly because they had and still have their big marketing machinery, while us Europeans were always too modest (or stupid) to shout about what we do. I am very happy that my friends from Archivio Tipografico have taken this on and even got Enrico Tallone to write about the history of the original edition. Come June 29, I’ll put my money where my mouth is and do my part of <i>krautfunding</i> the book.""<br/>— <strong>Erik Spiekermann</strong>, typographer, designer, and writer, p98a.berlin</p><p>""Aldo Novarese is one of the most interesting 20th-century type designers. He covered a wide range of styles in his work, but his oeuvre is sadly unknown to most present-day typographic enthusiasts outside of Italy. This is surely because of the language barrier. The initiative to republish Alpha-Beta – along with an English-language translation – should go a long way to restoring the global reputation Novarese had in the 1970s. I’m pleased that both young designers today and future generations will be able to access Novarese’s ideas more easily now.""<br/>— <strong>Dan Reynolds</strong>, Type designer, educator, and design historian</p><p>""A fundamental document of modern design is becoming available again, with the help of the type community. Not only does Aldo set forward the essential principles of good typography, but he shows how it is done in a delightful way.""<br/>— <strong>Roger Black</strong>, art director and typographer (Type Network)</p><p>""Aldo Novarese—much like William Addison Dwiggins, Rudolf Koch, Eric Gill, and even my grandfather, John Howard Benson—possessed an innate sense of the whole.  One could easily look at a piece of his work and wonder how he could bring together such seemingly disparate parts into an undeniably appealing, complete, and successful design.""<br/>— <strong>Nicholas Benson</strong>, stone carver, letterer, and proprietor of the John Stevens Shop</p><p>""We need to read the words of Aldo Novarese today, and we need to know more about his work, because it has shaped our global visual landscape. Every day, everywhere, we encounter his vision on our signs, screens, streets, pages, cars, clothes... The apparent simplicity of his design—the obvious and logical aesthetic of his typefaces, all so familiar to us—is the result of a unique and sophisticated process.""<br/>—<strong> François Rappo</strong>, educator, type and graphic designer</p><p>""Aldo Novarese is one of the often-overlooked maestros of 20th-century type design. His work veers from the sublime (Nova Augustea) to the goofy (Estro); from the ingenious (Stop) to the clumsy (Ritmo); and from the swoonily romantic (Fontanesi) to the severely utilitarian (Eurostile). Novarese is a designer one can simultaneously love and hate, but he cannot (and should not) be ignored.""<br/>— <strong>Paul Shaw</strong>, design historian<br/> </p><p> </p><h3>Production Details</h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595928936/pf0xm6e5zgipr17hudix.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">image above: Behind the dustjacket, a clothbound hardcover printed in hot-foil</p><p>This reissue of the book <i>Alfa-Beta</i> is, exactly as the original, 17×23,5 cm, 314 pages including introduction, endnotes and index, illustrated with 17 complete series of alphabets, 40 full-page examples, 92 alphabets and 194 documentations.

It is a highly specific vision of the discipline, written by a practitioner, describing the evolution of writing. He stakes no claim on completeness or scientific rigor, but rather outlines the field in a highly functional way, justifying the forms and typographic styles of the time. Therefore, in addition to being one of very few textbooks on the theory and practice of type design written by an Italian, <i>Alfa-Beta</i> also presents the history of typography from an original, dynamic perspective that remains a noteworthy source of inspiration.</p><p>Novarese’s first book marked a major milestone in Italian graphic design. This reissue will make it available once again to the broader public—not just specialists, nor solely for educational research. It is also a significant first step toward a better understanding of the era between the 1950s and 1980s—a heyday abruptly cut short by complex socioeconomic factors—which saw so much innovation in Italian graphic and typographic design, due in large part to Nebiolo and Progresso Grafico. This edition will also feature a new introduction, contextualizing the book’s original release, highlighting its current relevance, and describing the editorial logic guiding the reissue. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595929308/xklcvmttoaarxvcx1yzc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Aiming to produce a reissue as faithful as possible to the original book, we were thrilled to find the acetate films used to create the offset printing plates of the 1983 edition. This means we were able to avoid the daunting alternative: disassembling a copy of the original to scan its pages, which would in turn require additional adjustments for the paper’s texture, color, and other challenging elements. We therefore opted to digitize the original films and assign the correct color to each, which gives us full control during the printing process and allows us to preserve the original three-color separation.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595929660/fqvsqbanlzd4mrmtlamr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Digitization involved cleaning each and every film by hand and scanning it to obtain an extremely high-resolution file—2400 dpi—in order to capture maximum detail. Of course such high-quality scans also revealed every imperfection due to dust or decay. We removed these minor flaws primarily by using the scanner’s UV filter, and secondarily through minor digital retouching. This part of the process has required an immense amount of time and effort, but this once-in-a-lifetime project calls for no less, and we know our commitment will clearly show in the quality of the final print.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595929378/cmfznxcc4yhbwfkkogbg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Letterpress Specimen</h3><p> </p><p>To celebrate the centenary of Aldo Novarese’s birth we produced a limited-edition specimen book, pulled in only 300 numbered copies.

Type-crazed designer Lorenzo Bolzoni had his eye on one such book, but no luck finding it: Aldo Novarese’s <i>Alfa-Beta</i>. When he finally got his hands on a copy, the joy he felt sparked the idea of a reissue. He decided to reach out to Aldo’s heirs and, with help from Tipoteca Italiana—a museum in northeastern Italy that houses most of Novarese’s surviving work—got in touch with Matilde Argentero, one of his granddaughters. Serendipitously, she had recently begun rediscovering her grandfather’s work during visits to Archivio Tipografico, so was enthusiastic about the idea.

Therefore, the centenary of his birth—June 29, 2020—is the ideal occasion to celebrate his inestimable contribution to the discipline by reprinting Alfa-Beta, his landmark 1964 book on the history of writing systems and the evolution of type. 
Alfa-Beta — the book   The first edition of Alfa-Beta reviewed the evolution of writing systems and typography from their advent up to the present day. The first edition was published in 1964 by Progresso Grafico and distributed by G.B. Paravia & C. The book showcases a very specific point of view: it is one of very few works on the history of type originally written in Italian, and one of even fewer to have been written by a type designer rather than a historian or academic. It also marked the public debut of Novarese’s own typeface classification system. Aldo Novarese, who became director of Nebiolo’s in-house design studio in 1952, conceived of it as an overview of his in-depth historical study of letterforms and type design. Inspired by his teaching experience at Turin’s Vigliardi Paravia school, as well as annual gatherings in Lure, his introduction expressly describes it as an educational work—essentially a textbook—and in the text itself he captures the rich complexity of type design as an ever-changing discipline.  The chapters proceed in chronological order, but the way their contents are presented gradually moves from a spare outline of historical facts to a more vibrant narrative, increasingly conveyed through plates and illustrations presenting a vast variety of visuals. Its span encompasses the earliest forms of writing to the most contemporary character sets, culminating with the most recent and innovative type designs—including Eurostile, released by Nebiolo just two years prior. The entire book is dotted with intriguing tables charting the development of calligraphic styles and typographical characters, often selected from Novarese’s own designs.  Despite Nebiolo’s support of the broader work, the book itself was clearly produced independently: the company is never explicitly mentioned by name, and the text is set (probably for both proprietary as well as technical reasons) in Simoncini Linotype typefaces. The first edition was printed in tri-tone letterpress, set in Linotype, illustrated by polymer plate, bound in hardcover, and came with a laminated dust-jacket. Praise for Alfa-Beta
 ""I do not know enough about Italian type design. Our world has been so dominated by Anglo-American influences since the 70s, mostly because they had and still have their big marketing machinery, while us Europeans were always too modest (or stupid) to shout about what we do. I am very happy that my friends from Archivio Tipografico have taken this on and even got Enrico Tallone to write about the history of the original edition. Come June 29, I’ll put my money where my mouth is and do my part of krautfunding the book.""— Erik Spiekermann, typographer, designer, and writer, p98a.berlin""Aldo Novarese is one of the most interesting 20th-century type designers. He covered a wide range of styles in his work, but his oeuvre is sadly unknown to most present-day typographic enthusiasts outside of Italy. This is surely because of the language barrier. The initiative to republish Alpha-Beta – along with an English-language translation – should go a long way to restoring the global reputation Novarese had in the 1970s. I’m pleased that both young designers today and future generations will be able to access Novarese’s ideas more easily now.""— Dan Reynolds, Type designer, educator, and design historian""A fundamental document of modern design is becoming available again, with the help of the type community. Not only does Aldo set forward the essential principles of good typography, but he shows how it is done in a delightful way.""— Roger Black, art director and typographer (Type Network)""Aldo Novarese—much like William Addison Dwiggins, Rudolf Koch, Eric Gill, and even my grandfather, John Howard Benson—possessed an innate sense of the whole.  One could easily look at a piece of his work and wonder how he could bring together such seemingly disparate parts into an undeniably appealing, complete, and successful design.""— Nicholas Benson, stone carver, letterer, and proprietor of the John Stevens Shop""We need to read the words of Aldo Novarese today, and we need to know more about his work, because it has shaped our global visual landscape. Every day, everywhere, we encounter his vision on our signs, screens, streets, pages, cars, clothes... The apparent simplicity of his design—the obvious and logical aesthetic of his typefaces, all so familiar to us—is the result of a unique and sophisticated process.""— François Rappo, educator, type and graphic designer""Aldo Novarese is one of the often-overlooked maestros of 20th-century type design. His work veers from the sublime (Nova Augustea) to the goofy (Estro); from the ingenious (Stop) to the clumsy (Ritmo); and from the swoonily romantic (Fontanesi) to the severely utilitarian (Eurostile). Novarese is a designer one can simultaneously love and hate, but he cannot (and should not) be ignored.""— Paul Shaw, design historian  Production Details image above: Behind the dustjacket, a clothbound hardcover printed in hot-foilThis reissue of the book Alfa-Beta is, exactly as the original, 17×23,5 cm, 314 pages including introduction, endnotes and index, illustrated with 17 complete series of alphabets, 40 full-page examples, 92 alphabets and 194 documentations. It is printed on Fedrigoni Arena paper, using the same three-color separation as the original edition, in clothbound hardcover printed in hot-foil, manufactured exclusively in Italy.  Scheme of the Standard Edition. Slipcase (paper 360 g/m²) containing:Alfa-Beta book + Reader's GuideThis slipcased facsimile edition comes alongside a softcover Reader’s Guide in the exact same trim size, which includes: the full English translation of Novarese’s original text; an introduction by the editorial and production teams describing the development of the reissue; and a preface by Enrico Tallone on the historical context within which Novarese wrote Alfa-Beta.  Scheme of the Deluxe Edition. Hardcover slipcase containing:Alfa-Beta book + Reader's Guide + Numbered Letterpress Specimen in its own slipcaseThe Deluxe Edition will likewise include the Alfa-Beta book and the Reader’s Guide and, in addition, the numbered letterpress specimen, all three housed together in a hardcover box, printed in hot-foil.  The Reissue  Alfa-Beta is a testament to Aldo Novarese’s overall work and design ethos. It is a highly specific vision of the discipline, written by a practitioner, describing the evolution of writing. He stakes no claim on completeness or scientific rigor, but rather outlines the field in a highly functional way, justifying the forms and typographic styles of the time. Therefore, in addition to being one of very few textbooks on the theory and practice of type design written by an Italian, Alfa-Beta also presents the history of typography from an original, dynamic perspective that remains a noteworthy source of inspiration.Novarese’s first book marked a major milestone in Italian graphic design. This reissue will make it available once again to the broader public—not just specialists, nor solely for educational research. It is also a significant first step toward a better understanding of the era between the 1950s and 1980s—a heyday abruptly cut short by complex socioeconomic factors—which saw so much innovation in Italian graphic and typographic design, due in large part to Nebiolo and Progresso Grafico. This edition will also feature a new introduction, contextualizing the book’s original release, highlighting its current relevance, and describing the editorial logic guiding the reissue.   Aiming to produce a reissue as faithful as possible to the original book, we were thrilled to find the acetate films used to create the offset printing plates of the 1983 edition. This means we were able to avoid the daunting alternative: disassembling a copy of the original to scan its pages, which would in turn require additional adjustments for the paper’s texture, color, and other challenging elements. We therefore opted to digitize the original films and assign the correct color to each, which gives us full control during the printing process and allows us to preserve the original three-color separation.  Digitization involved cleaning each and every film by hand and scanning it to obtain an extremely high-resolution file—2400 dpi—in order to capture maximum detail. Of course such high-quality scans also revealed every imperfection due to dust or decay. We removed these minor flaws primarily by using the scanner’s UV filter, and secondarily through minor digital retouching. This part of the process has required an immense amount of time and effort, but this once-in-a-lifetime project calls for no less, and we know our commitment will clearly show in the quality of the final print.   Letterpress Specimen To celebrate the centenary of Aldo Novarese’s birth we produced a limited-edition specimen book, pulled in only 300 numbered copies. It has been designed and printed with movable types from Archivio Tipografico’s collection—all designed by Novarese and cast by Nebiolo foundry—including Magister, Stop, Fontanesi, Metropol, Garaldus, Eurostile, Juliet, Slogan, Forma, Dattilo, Nova Augustea, and Estro. This specimen will be part of the Deluxe Edition.   Produced in the exact trim size of the original Alfa-Beta book and housed in a cardboard slipcase. 40 pages, hand-sewn saddle stitch binding. Printed on Fedrigoni Woodstock, Sirio, Arena papers, thin glassine and old laid papers. Diptych Poster  Aldo Novarese is widely known for his amazing skills in drawing and design, but what set him apart from his colleagues was definitely his storytelling ability. We decided to print a diptych poster (50×70 cm each) with one of the most iconic spreads of Alfa-Beta (page 250, 251), featuring the story behind the concept of the squared shape for Microgramma (originally by his teacher A. Butti) and, later on, for his masterpiece Eurostile. Entirely letterpress printed by Archivio Tipografico in Torino, Italy.   “The square, compact shape is, by now, familiar: it is present and predominant in everything around us. And the typeface today—as in the past—is camouflaged by and blends in with other aesthetic expressions of the contemporary period.” — Aldo Novarese, Alfa-Beta, page 251 Nova Augustea digital typeface  To commemorate the centenary of Aldo Novarese’s birth we're reviving Nova Augustea, a typeface published by Nebiolo in 1964, the same year of Alfa-Beta. It was based on Augustea, designed by his mentor and teacher Alessandro Butti. The font is drawn and produced by Studio 23.56 – the graphic and type design studio working with, for and within Archivio Tipografico – and used in all the communication collaterals of this campaign. BackstoryThis project arose from the deep passion for letterforms and typography underlying our quest for inspiring books we often fall in love with. Type-crazed designer Lorenzo Bolzoni had his eye on one such book, but no luck finding it: Aldo Novarese’s Alfa-Beta. When he finally got his hands on a copy, the joy he felt sparked the idea of a reissue. He decided to reach out to Aldo’s heirs and, with help from Tipoteca Italiana—a museum in northeastern Italy that houses most of Novarese’s surviving work—got in touch with Matilde Argentero, one of his granddaughters. Serendipitously, she had recently begun rediscovering her grandfather’s work during visits to Archivio Tipografico, so was enthusiastic about the idea. She intuitively knew Archivio Tipografico’s team would be eager to dive in.  from left to right: Davide Tomatis, Lorenzo Bolzoni, Gabriele Fumero, Emanuele Mensa, Danilo Mondino, Nello Russo, Matilde Argentero, Davide Eucalipto Project Credits Matilde Argentero is one of the four Aldo Novarese’s granddaughters. She went on to work in design and marketing, but a drive to reconcile digital design and material reality led her to Archivio Tipografico, where these two worlds collide, and where Matilde reconnected with her roots. This was the fuse that sparked the entire reissue.Lorenzo Bolzoni is a letterer and senior designer for comic book publisher BAO.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">I was very excited to prepare David for LONE WOLF McQUADE, which I think is a fantastic movie and is still popular today.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">Just recently at the Hollywood museum in Hollywood, California, they had the grand opening of the of the David Carradine exhibit inducting him into the Hollywood Hall of Fame. A great deal of David Carradine memorabilia was placed on display with most of it being from the KUNG FU TV Series and his Kwai Chang Caine character. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">While standing there before the David Carradine exhibit at his induction into the Hollywood Hall of Fame Memorial with David’s family and many admirers recently, I had an incredible revelation. Never in my life have I ever been so touched and driven to accomplish something with such conviction. An electrical charge was put upon me and into every fiber of my body urging me to put my life’s journey with David into memoirs and audio tapes and to share it with the rest of the world. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">David was a very private man but he was very wise and lived a very spiritual life and he walked his own path, although we forged a very strong bond between us and we both searched spiritually and consciously for the same things. There is a great deal about David that I am probably the only one on the planet that knows of these special and private things and I think the world deserves to see and understand as much as I can deliver. I want to share so much now to further my quest of immortalizing David and Qui Chang Caine and continuing on with his work and being a part of the immortalizing him and his journey in this world that was extinguished much too soon. <span style=""""> </span></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">I like to practice martial arts all day in between trying to perfect the physical movement of Fibonacci while trying to totally and metaphysically transcend my body through a brick wall or even a mountain.

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">There are a great deal of mysteries in this world that seem unexplainable and we have numerous abilities that have never been tapped and David and I were on an incredible journey together exploring many of these aspects. The history of the ninjas and Shaolin monks is true and their ways and knowledge are very applicable to our everyday life if we will simply open our hearts and minds and feel nature’s wisdom. Does this sound crazy? Unbelievable? <span style=""""> </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">During a journey through the snowy mountains of Tibet while training in heavy snow and blizzard conditions, I felt a funny feeling run up and down my spine and made the hair stand up on the back of my neck I sensed another being in our presence. It made me look up and to my awe and amazement I found myself gazing at what appeared to be a huge white abominable roaming through the highlands in the mountains. As I moved toward it with curiosity I almost felt a kindred spirit at is stopped for a moment to make eye contact with me as if to acknowledge he felt the same. But before I could truly get closer it was too late, the creature or being or whatever it was had slipped out of site bounding with gigantic steps and covering a lot of territory almost effortlessly. Although I was not able to get close enough to see him clearly with the wind and it snowing so hard, I know what I saw was real. It was a moment that will be emblazoned in my memory for the rest of my being.<span style="""">  </span></span></p>

Did we party? Stick around and find out.   <span style="""">  </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">I want my memoirs to be a life changing experience for those that read them and I want it to be even more of a life changing experience for those that know that they contributed to making it happen. I certainly in no way want to sound aggressive or arrogant but I hope that people will consider it an honor to have the chance to participate in this historic journey of immortalizing Kwai Chang Caine as I certainly do. I do not feel that it was by chance that I met David Carradine and became his Sifu and best friend but rather it was my destiny.<span style="""">   </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">Due to David being a celebrity, all or some of the content and subject matter will be claimed by others, so I am going to be spending a lot of money on attorneys and getting things cleared for me to use. I will also have licensing and trademarking fees as well as graphics artists and web guys. Good writers all want to be paid for some darn reason and I figure I will have to spend some serious time together with them working on this. I love this state of California but it is going to really slam me with taxes on this money too. I know that is not a politically correct thing to say but I am more into reality than political correctness.   </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 115%;"">I am also going to do some traveling to see people and talk to them about past events and to also recover as many photos as possible that I think will be relevant to the book. </span></p>

Just recently at the Hollywood museum in Hollywood, California, they had the grand opening of the of the David Carradine exhibit inducting him into the Hollywood Hall of Fame. A great deal of David Carradine memorabilia was placed on display with most of it being from the KUNG FU TV Series and his Kwai Chang Caine character. 
While standing there before the David Carradine exhibit at his induction into the Hollywood Hall of Fame Memorial with David’s family and many admirers recently, I had an incredible revelation. Never in my life have I ever been so touched and driven to accomplish something with such conviction. An electrical charge was put upon me and into every fiber of my body urging me to put my life’s journey with David into memoirs and audio tapes and to share it with the rest of the world. 
David was a very private man but he was very wise and lived a very spiritual life and he walked his own path, although we forged a very strong bond between us and we both searched spiritually and consciously for the same things. There is a great deal about David that I am probably the only one on the planet that knows of these special and private things and I think the world deserves to see and understand as much as I can deliver. I want to share so much now to further my quest of immortalizing David and Qui Chang Caine and continuing on with his work and being a part of the immortalizing him and his journey in this world that was extinguished much too soon.  
I am not an Internet guy at all. I am closer to the guys you see in the movies that live  up in the temples without electricity and pack in their own water. Although I have been known to sneak in an occasional beer or beers camouflaged with goats milk. 
I like to practice martial arts all day in between trying to perfect the physical movement of Fibonacci while trying to totally and metaphysically transcend my body through a brick wall or even a mountain. I tried doing this with a bank vault but I still have not perfected getting the money to transform too. If I did I would not be here now. 
There are a great deal of mysteries in this world that seem unexplainable and we have numerous abilities that have never been tapped and David and I were on an incredible journey together exploring many of these aspects. The history of the ninjas and Shaolin monks is true and their ways and knowledge are very applicable to our everyday life if we will simply open our hearts and minds and feel nature’s wisdom. Does this sound crazy? Unbelievable?  
During a journey through the snowy mountains of Tibet while training in heavy snow and blizzard conditions, I felt a funny feeling run up and down my spine and made the hair stand up on the back of my neck I sensed another being in our presence. It made me look up and to my awe and amazement I found myself gazing at what appeared to be a huge white abominable roaming through the highlands in the mountains. As I moved toward it with curiosity I almost felt a kindred spirit at is stopped for a moment to make eye contact with me as if to acknowledge he felt the same. But before I could truly get closer it was too late, the creature or being or whatever it was had slipped out of site bounding with gigantic steps and covering a lot of territory almost effortlessly. Although I was not able to get close enough to see him clearly with the wind and it snowing so hard, I know what I saw was real. It was a moment that will be emblazoned in my memory for the rest of my being.  
I am reaching out to the world now and announcing that I am going to be bringing you to the wonderful and secretive inside world of David Carradine and I want to share our years of studying and knowledge and the many things we actually did learn from the Shaolin monks of China. Did we party? Stick around and find out.     
I want my memoirs to be a life changing experience for those that read them and I want it to be even more of a life changing experience for those that know that they contributed to making it happen. I certainly in no way want to sound aggressive or arrogant but I hope that people will consider it an honor to have the chance to participate in this historic journey of immortalizing Kwai Chang Caine as I certainly do. I do not feel that it was by chance that I met David Carradine and became his Sifu and best friend but rather it was my destiny.   
Due to David being a celebrity, all or some of the content and subject matter will be claimed by others, so I am going to be spending a lot of money on attorneys and getting things cleared for me to use. I will also have licensing and trademarking fees as well as graphics artists and web guys. Good writers all want to be paid for some darn reason and I figure I will have to spend some serious time together with them working on this. I love this state of California but it is going to really slam me with taxes on this money too. I know that is not a politically correct thing to say but I am more into reality than political correctness.   
I am also going to do some traveling to see people and talk to them about past events and to also recover as many photos as possible that I think will be relevant to the book. 
I am also very excited to be working on a TV/movie deal upon completion of this project. I am here to show the producers and the world that the interest is still there for David Carradine and Kwai Chang Caine and I told everyone I would prove it to them by raising the money to write my book. Thank you all so much for joining me in my mission to immortlize David and Kwai Chang Caine along with our adventures.
I will gladly take into consideration any and all ideas that are emailed to me concerning how or what to offer in return for helping me to fund my project or just any ideas or comments in general. I am all about learning through every step of my being.
This project is very near and dear to me so I am going to make every effort possible to make it a fun and exciting and I will also make every effort to make everyone that participates happy with what I can deliver to them in both the book and the items I can offer in return for their wonderful contributions.
So I truly thank you for becoming a part of my quest as we begin our journey together as we manifest a modern approach to an ancient art form not only in this book but with our life's and more projects to come. Let's make history and let the legend continue.
 
All my best to you in all things and your life journey.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Unleashing Your Innovative Genius: High School Redesigned</i> is an interpersonal guide to help you understand how to recreate what it means to have a high school education and maximize it to the fullest. Whether you have yet to attend high school, are in high school, or graduated high school feeling shortchanged, I want you to emerge after reading this book feeling more sure of yourself, your agency, and your ability to impact.<br/><br/>My name is Deborah Olatunji and I am the author of <i>Unleashing Your Innovative Genius: High School Redesigned</i>. I wrote this book because I am obsessed with helping people unlock their potential and realize just how powerful they are when they utilize obtainable resources. I’ve taken a closer look at how to hack homework, high school, and life in school and outside of it. I have done this by examining other student and young adult change-makers’ lives, diverse models of education, and global superpowers who are changing the game for education in the world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that high school does not have to have a sole focus on where you will go to college. Rather, high school is the framework for exploration, innovation, and collaboration for your future. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for student agency in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you tackle learning, ignite passion, and discover purpose in and beyond those four important years. This book seeks to highlight people who have hacked the process early on and are living the lives they’ve never imagined.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how to create your own channels of access and how to utilize moonshot thinking in your own way:</p>
<ul>
<li>How a former Division 1 soccer player changed her path to pursuit for health awareness and engineering affordable prosthetic equipment</li>
<li>How a law student learned from failure for the first time in her 30+ years of life and how that recognition of thinking big and accepting the opposite outcome made her more courageous</li>
<li>Why different models of schooling are effective, like the home-school method, and how to use pieces of each method to make your experience more beneficial</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are about to enter high school, are in high school, or left high school feeling empty-handed. If you have wanted more from the traditional method of education for a long time, but haven’t quite understood how to do so then this book truly is for you. You will cherish this book if you have always wanted to learn topics outside of the restrictive curriculum but never saw that agency as an option to aiding you in the pursuit of your own learning. <i>Unleashing Your Innovative Genius</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to students who have so much more to offer and future community leaders who are looking to learn from failure and maximize your known and unknown resources for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Unleashing Your Innovative Genius</h2>
<p>My book is written in 3 Parts...<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction, Chapters 1-7, and in-depth personal stories on my experience in academia from my first F to my recognition of passion. This section deals with the subtopic of how to conquer in the classroom. I breakdown the mindsets behind advocacy leaders, students who earned both high school and associate’s or bachelor’s degrees simultaneously, and the concept of being average. In this part, you will learn how to create your own independent studies, work through academic and social difficulty, and identify areas in your education that need reworking (and how to rewire them!)<br/><br/>Part 2 covers Chapters 8-14 and takes a closer look at how to retrain the way we think about education, high school, learning, the full gambit. It deconstructs what an authentic student-teacher/professor relationship should accomplish and debunks my shoe-box theory of embracing one’s learning. It also analyzes Angela Duckworth’s theory of grit and its relationship with building character, while highlighting A.J. Juliani’s concept of 20% time and how to work that into your own routine.<br/><br/>Part 3 holds Chapters 15-22 and the Afterwords. The chapters go into how to effectively utilize the outside world to ultimately unleash the power of genius and agency in your high school, college, career, and life ahead. They consider the viewpoints from celebrated valedictorians (who actually have a lot of knowledge to dish out when you slow the tape down, watch their speech in the comfort of your own home, and have a bucket of popcorn handy), student founders and entrepreneurs, climate advocates, and young education disruptors. The Afterwords are a special part of the book because the <strong>amazing</strong> people I interviewed for the stories in my book were invited to write a letter to their future children, contributing to the voice of what the education system needs to reflect to ensure innovation, collaboration, and exploration early on for young minds. Their letters are curated in the final chapter of the book, emphasizing the point that in order to redesign high school or any learning center of any kind, more than one voice must be reached out to, considered, and implemented.<br/><br/>At the end of the chapters, there are bullet-points or numbered lists of steps to take to actualize the ideas discussed.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Deborah Olatunji is an accomplished writer, poet, activist, friend, and a high school student. As the Founder and president of her own social venture, the Student Leadership Initiative Program, she and her peers help students in her school to navigate their interests and passions through a mentorship-fueled organization. Based in Delaware, SLIP has other branches in the state and the continental United States such as Georgia and more to come. She is<strong> intensely passionate </strong>about being a disrupter and catalytic force in the education system. Deborah is also one of nine board members nationwide for a youth-driven, New York-based non-profit organization called GripTape. Their mission is to give youth decision-making control over what and how they learn with small grants to pursue a topic they’re passionate about and a Champion to encourage them along the way. She has been serving since June 2018.<br/><br/>Deborah wrote this book because of her strong desire for students to realize and actualize their power. By power, she is referring to the beauty of autonomy and accessibility of resources to propel students’ futures forward <strong>faster</strong>. Her interest in reforming education kicked off in the spring of 2018 when she noticed that many of her classmates, herself included, had a misleading view of what it meant to genuinely enjoy learning. While her goal to form activist groups to protest the current state of education in America has been shelved for the time being, Deborah felt it extremely necessary to write a book that spoke directly to high school students because the makers of the school laws rarely reach out <i>and</i> consider their input.<br/><br/>Deborah Olatunji is an intermediate photographer and makes mini-films with her twin sister Dorcas in her spare time. She enjoys photo-shoots everywhere and anywhere you can imagine―NYC subways, the Philadelphia train station, art walls, hammocks, classrooms, roller skating rinks, park benches, etc.―and always has a smile on (despite the lighting, exposure, and “photo-crashers” getting in the way).<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Deborah at @deb_olatunji on Twitter, Instagram, and email at <a href=""http://kdeboraholatunji@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">kdeboraholatunji@gmail.com</a>.

<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

<h3>Our Story:  “Equine Spirit from the Past.”</h3>
<p>The War Horse &amp; Militaria Heritage Foundation  (WHAM) presents
famous cavalry regiments throughout history and the world; educating the role
of horses in military history.  We have been accepted to be in the Tournament of Roses Parade in 2012. (Jan 2, 2012) We are very excited with this honor!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<br/><span class=""agText""><p>WHAM is the only organization in the world that presents the 1815 Royal
Scots Greys and several other famous Napoleonic cavalry regiments and has performed at countless local civic events, schools and
festivals in southern California
including Scottish Festivals and the prestigious Tournament of Roses Parade.
WHAM is a registered 501-c3 non-profit.  </p>
<p></p></span><br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Help our non-profit afford the extras to make a grand and glittering impression of our horses and riders at the spectacularTournament of Roses Parade.We are in the midst of making new equipment and replacing items for the uniforms and tack and equipment on the horses. This all costs money! Its financially challenging for small non-profit.<br/></p>
<p>Items:<br/></p>
<p>We need to obtain white over-girths to go over the saddles and sheepskin covers. The over-girths that are suitable professional racing grade that have an appropriate historical look and feel. We are making new shabraques (military style saddle blankets), valises (saddle back pouch) and tack. We also wish to purchase roses to wear on the braided manes and tails of the horses<br/></p>
<p>We are making shakos and plates and braiding for hats and helmets.</p>
<p>We are purchasing fabrics and piping and sewing from now till the holidays!</p>
<p>We will have a dozen horses and riders in the parade along with fully uniformed walkers.</p>
<p>We are presenting the Royal Scots Greys, the Prussian Hussars, the Bavarian Chevaulegers and French Chasseurs. (Three for each!)<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We could use your help!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All of these items and materials cost money.  The over girths are $50 each. The braids for hats are 25$ each, Feather plumes are <br/></p>
<p>$20 each... times 12 and you can see the costs rising. Chinscales are $55 each.  Fresh roses are going to <br/></p>
<p>be $25-30 per horse.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our riders have all contributed but we need additional funding assistance.  We have a two student riders that we would like to have their costs sponsored. $300 each.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Any remaining funds would be spent on transportation and logistical expenses for the riders and crew/volunteers, gas, snacks and general program expenses.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Do<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>War Horse does presentations at schools and community events. We also help other non-profits in their fund-raising. We work closely with organizations like Special Spirit and the Kiwanis Handicap Riding Program.</p>
<p>Having the honor of being in the Rose Parade gives War Horse great visibility, prestige and outreach to work with other civic events and non-profits. Your help with our presentation will greatly benefit our organization and create new contacts and opportunities. <br/></p>

The War Horse & Militaria Heritage Foundation  (WHAM) presents
famous cavalry regiments throughout history and the world; educating the role
of horses in military history.  We have been accepted to be in the Tournament of Roses Parade in 2012. (Jan 2, 2012) We are very excited with this honor!


The Impact
WHAM is the only organization in the world that presents the 1815 Royal
Scots Greys and several other famous Napoleonic cavalry regiments and has performed at countless local civic events, schools and
festivals in southern California
including Scottish Festivals and the prestigious Tournament of Roses Parade.
WHAM is a registered 501-c3 non-profit.  


What We Need & What You Get
Help our non-profit afford the extras to make a grand and glittering impression of our horses and riders at the spectacularTournament of Roses Parade.We are in the midst of making new equipment and replacing items for the uniforms and tack and equipment on the horses. This all costs money! Its financially challenging for small non-profit.
Items:
We need to obtain white over-girths to go over the saddles and sheepskin covers. The over-girths that are suitable professional racing grade that have an appropriate historical look and feel. We are making new shabraques (military style saddle blankets), valises (saddle back pouch) and tack. We also wish to purchase roses to wear on the braided manes and tails of the horses
We are making shakos and plates and braiding for hats and helmets.
We are purchasing fabrics and piping and sewing from now till the holidays!
We will have a dozen horses and riders in the parade along with fully uniformed walkers.
We are presenting the Royal Scots Greys, the Prussian Hussars, the Bavarian Chevaulegers and French Chasseurs. (Three for each!)

We could use your help!

All of these items and materials cost money.  The over girths are $50 each. The braids for hats are 25$ each, Feather plumes are 
$20 each... times 12 and you can see the costs rising. Chinscales are $55 each.  Fresh roses are going to 
be $25-30 per horse.

Our riders have all contributed but we need additional funding assistance.  We have a two student riders that we would like to have their costs sponsored. $300 each.

Any remaining funds would be spent on transportation and logistical expenses for the riders and crew/volunteers, gas, snacks and general program expenses.

What We Do

War Horse does presentations at schools and community events. We also help other non-profits in their fund-raising. We work closely with organizations like Special Spirit and the Kiwanis Handicap Riding Program.
Having the honor of being in the Rose Parade gives War Horse great visibility, prestige and outreach to work with other civic events and non-profits. Your help with our presentation will greatly benefit our organization and create new contacts and opportunities.

The research he has done for this is extensive and it would be an enormous shame for it not to see the light of day.
What We Need


I'll get straight to the point.
Dave needs $250.
I've put it down for $500 because that is the minimum allowed on Indiegogo.The money raised here would be the icing on his publishing cake as he has already saved up an amount on his own, but circumstances have left him short of his goal.
In return, apart from eternal gratitude, I'm sure Dave would be prepared to extend thanks in some capacity to those willing to help out.


Even if you can't help out financially, your assistance in getting the word out once the book actually IS published would be greatly appreciated.
Publishing isn't cheap and self-publishing, although cheaper, can still be a financially daunting experience.
Dave doesn't know I'm doing this for him, but I'd like him to know we DID it for him.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Did you know that more than 95% of the general population don't have basic health insurance knowledge, according to Kaiser Family Foundation? That's alarming. This important, everyday information isn't taught in school, and the trivial amount of training from employers is not sufficient. It is no wonder that two in three Americans who went bankrupt cited medical debt as a contributing factor of their bankruptcies, according to the American Journal of Public Health.<br/><br/>My name is HanhLinh, and I am the author of <i>The Smart Patient</i>. I wrote this book because even as a technologically savvy person, I wasted a lot of time, money, and compromised my health trying to navigate the American healthcare system. When I started having a family, I was shocked to receive a notice that said “Patient owes: $16,000,” stemming from the outrageous medical billing practices that have been going on for decades in the healthcare industry. Despite the top-notch technologies and advances in research, the profit-driven world of American healthcare was going to passively hurt me if I didn’t wise up quickly. That was when I paid closer attention to the system and learned the necessary precautions.<br/><br/>Looking for the answers wasn’t easy. The information I found online was full of jargon, like coinsurance, out-of-pocket max, and more. Books I encountered were mostly about why the American healthcare system is broken and how to fix it with large health reforms versus how to tactically navigate and avoid the “potholes”. I wanted something that would show me how to go about my daily life and get the biggest bang for my bucks in a language that’s fun, easy to read, and to the point.<br/><br/>My hope is that, by reading this book, you will discover that to be in the top five percent, you need to know what the top five percent knows. You will see that it is easy to learn the basics, yet most people give in to the noise of the complex system and become a passive consumer. By learning from those in the stories, you can stand on the shoulders of giants and be more effective at managing your own healthcare finances. While I don't have all the answers, I believe that this book provides a solid foundation in understanding the tools and tactics needed to navigate the current healthcare landscape, which is full of gaps as revealed during the pandemic. My goal is to help people become their best selves by empowering them with stories of others who have overcome their own challenges.<br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for becoming a smart patient in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you invest in yourself and be your best you! You'll learn about the different players impacting the healthcare system, how to better manage your medical bills, and how to leverage technology to reduce your healthcare cost. You'll hear real stories from patients and healthcare professional interviewees below:</p><ul>
<li>Doug Hirsch - Co-founder and CEO of GoodRx, a technology company that provides telemedicine and medication coupons that can reduce cost up to 80 percent. Hirsch shares intimate details about his personal inspirations behind GoodRx and commitment of reducing cost and increasing transparency in healthcare.</li>
<li>Dr. Alan Balch - CEO of National Patient Advocate Foundation (NPAF), a non-profit organization committed to providing financial support for patients dealing with chronic illnesses. Dr. Balch opens up about his personal motivation to join the field and the one common factor that patients from all backgrounds and ages can relate to.</li>
<li>Dr. Viet Nguyen - Medical Director and Founder of Fairfax Clinic, a medical clinic in Northern Virginia that provides world-class primary care and addiction care. Dr. Nguyen shares raw and honest stories of his experience working at various different care centers and the must-know avenues for seeking affordable care.</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are someone who wants to be the top five percent of the population and get best value for your care. This book shines light on the most important aspects, including utilizing health insurance, negotiating medical bills, choosing primary care vs emergency department, reducing medication cost, and more.<br/><br/><i>The Smart Patient</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to anyone living in the US who is looking at healthcare and financial independence in a new way. Ultimately, I hope that this book inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>Who is responsible for the rising cost of American healthcare?</li>
<li>Which technology can help me reduce my healthcare cost?</li>
<li>What are the most important aspects of my health insurance benefits?</li>
</ul><p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing hospital care, medical bills, health insurance, and healthcare technologies will change us all for the better.</p><h2> </h2><h2>The Book - <i>The Smart Patient</i>
</h2><p>The book is written in 4 parts...<br/><br/>Part [1] contains the Introduction of why I decided to write this book and the stories that shaped my motivations. In chapters 1 to 3, readers will learn about the roles of different players in the healthcare system with a little game I call “Follow the Money.” Through that, readers will discover who is truly responsible for the rising cost of healthcare and what patients can do to fight through the noise so they can get the care they need.<br/><br/>Part [2] contains Chapters 4 to 7. These chapters argue against the commonly held belief that having health insurance is enough. Readers will learn about different levels of care, medication cost, and how to extract the most important information from their health insurance benefits. It’s also here where readers learn that most ambulances are out-of-network, leaving patients to pay hundreds to thousands of dollars out-of-pocket if they end up in one.<br/><br/>Part [3] contains Chapters 8 to 11, which goes in depth about medical bills and financial assistance. Readers will learn how to spot medical bill errors, how to negotiate their bills, and what to do if they end up needing care without having health insurance. Here is where readers will also learn about the different financial assistance options to consider.<br/><br/>Part [4] contains Chapters 12 to 15, which is a call to action for readers to become the top one percent smartest patients in the room. This final section inspires readers to push boundaries, leverage technologies, and transform their healthcare experience. It is about igniting the fire from within to persist through the noise of the system and be the best version of oneself.<br/> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

She is dedicated to optimizing business operations to achieve the highest level of patient satisfaction. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, her focus has been to ensure the clinic remains open safely to continually serve the community.<br/><br/>Previously, HanhLinh worked as a technology consultant for a diverse group of clients, including the National Institutes of Health, a Fortune 500 insurance company, large transportation companies in Japan and Vietnam, and several other federal organizations. Her blended approach of creativity, people-centric innovations, and agile adaptation allows her to spot and accelerate growth opportunities. HanhLinh’s global background, along with her rich experience in business analytics, strategy consulting, and technical project management, elevates her clients’ organizations to new heights.<br/><br/>Her passion for improving the business of healthcare started when she had her first baby. During the first few months of her pregnancy, HanhLinh was uninsured and struggled to find an affordable healthcare option. She went from uninsured, to underinsured, to insured within a span of 4 months. Having to quickly ramp up and learn how to be a smart patient inspired her to write this book to help others, spark hope, and instill persistence. She believes that with knowledge and determination, patients can better manage their healthcare finances and claim what is rightfully theirs.<br/><br/>When HanhLinh is not working on her MBA at Georgetown University, she would be painting, playing tennis, or reading unconventional books.

I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p><ul>

<h3>Lezine</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Hazel, a visual artist from Montreal, and I'm making a lesbian portrait zine: a zine portraying twenty different lesbians as they see themselves and wish to be seen by others.</p>
<p>I started this because it’s difficult to find lesbian media/art, and even when it exists it represents a narrow range of experiences: cis, white, gender conforming. This zine is by and for lesbians, each ""portrait"" created by considering each person's likes, personality and identity as a lesbian and interpreted through digital collage and drawing.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>The Vintage Mindset</i> is about the major crises that have erupted within the fashion industry and alternate business models that could be utilized to fix them. This book features interviews with innovative young entrepreneurs who are passionately working to to better the future of our beloved industry and planet.<br/><br/>My name is Jillian McCarthy and I am the author of The Vintage Mindset. I wrote this book because I love fashion, luxury goods, and thinking about how to make production more ethically-minded.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover more about the consumer mindset within an industry that has not implemented solutions to massive polluting practices. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the fashion and retail worlds in a new way, to escape from the white walls of your favorite store, and to learn alongside Isabel Holden and Steph Hon about the importance of textiles and dyes.<br/><br/>The Vintage Mindset speaks to industry professionals and inquisitive young minds who want to grapple with the pollution created by the fashion industry and understand the finished product in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that The Vintage Mindset inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>What can you do about the current state of the fashion industry?</p>
<p>What are other alternative business models to make our industry more sustainable?</p>
<p>Who are the trailblazers initiating change within the industry?</p>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing fashion, business models, textiles, plastics, and dyes, will change us all for the better.</p>
<h2>The Book- The Vintage Mindset</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and additional chapters. Readers will learn about the current state of the fashion industry and the changes that are necessary to preserve, nurture, and grow the future of our industry with our planet in mind.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 5-8. The reader will read interviews with various fashion designers and entrepreneurs making strides in the industry by implementing creative changes and forging ahead with their own business ventures.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 9-12. In these final chapters, the reader will understand a discussion based on famous Dutch trend forecaster Li Edelkoort’s visions for the future of the industry. The reader will also dive into the vintage ideology and distinguish where they stand on the second-hand market debate.<br/> </p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2020</p>
<p>The cover design of my book (the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</p>
<p>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, e-book formats)</p>
<p>The copy editing for my book to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</p>
<p>The launch and promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this winter</p> When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<p>A personally signed copy of my book when I publish,</p>

<h3>Bouncing Back: Athletic Transition Successes, Failures, and Lessons Learned Along the Way</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Patrick Finnegan and I am the author of Bouncing Back: Athletic Transition Successes, Failures, and Lessons Learned Along the Way. I wrote this book because as a former collegiate athlete, I found the transition out of competitive sports to be difficult, lonely, and unfamiliar and I hope that by writing this book and collecting the stories of many others, I can help past, current, and future athletes make their inevitable transitions easier.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what goes into the mindset of an athlete, the pitfalls and challenges that can come of that mindset, and how athletes can use their experiences to ease their transitions out of sport into success off the field. In this book, I hope to offer some new insight on what goes into developing an athlete's mindset and identity, and why that same identity and mindset can lead to a difficult transition out of sport. At the same time, I want to show that a smooth transition is possible for athletes leaving their sport behind, using examples of former athletes leaning on their athletic natures and instincts to succeed in the transition as a beacon of hope. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand how you as an athlete or you as a loved one of an athlete can leverage the skills developed as an athlete to succeed in the transition out of one.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how athletes can better cope with the transition experience and the loss of identity that can occur upon retirement through stories of other athletes who have gone through the challenges such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian Ching, former US Men’s National Soccer Team and MLS MVP</li>
<li>Mary Ricks, former NCAA Softball Champion at UCLA, and current President of Kennedy Wilson, a global Real Estate firm</li>
<li>Michael Chabala, former MLS player turned fitness startup and entrepreneur</li>
<li>and many, many more!</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in understanding what happens to athletes at the conclusion of their careers and what the retirement process entails .</p>
<p><br/>Bouncing Back is a non-fiction book that speaks to athletes and their loved ones who are looking at understanding what may be on the horizon when their athletic careers end, told through the lens of former athletes who know, understand, and have also experienced the transition.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Bouncing Back: Athletic Transition Successes, Failures, and Lessons Learned Along the Way</h3>
<br/>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and a brief academic and sociological exploration of what occurs when athletes retire and what aspects of their athletic experiences.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters that cover general themes and key learnings from the stories of athletes that I had the privilege of speaking with and learning from, covering a range of topics from establishing your support systems to finding competitive outlets.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters that synthesize the commentary and provide insights on how you as an athlete can leverage these learnings, as well as a bonus epilogue with quotes and advice from athletes spanning a variety of topics.<p> </p>

The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

</h2>
<p><em>The Jesus Blueprint</em> is being written to serve as an envisioning and equipping tool to enable every follower of Jesus to actively engage in His disciple-making mandate (Mt.28:18-20). My hope is that it will be used broadly to influence students to salesmen, artists to architects, techies to teachers, politicians to pastors, men and women of all ages, as well as denominations and domains.

<p>Although still in the final editing stage, here are some of the chapter themes:</p>
<p>•<em>The Acts of the Discipled</em> –why the Book of Acts was so transformative – both in and outside the Church</p>
<p>•<em>The Fruitfulness Factor </em>– how to measure spiritual fruitfulness and grow fruitful disciple-makers</p>
<p>•<em>The Jesus Blueprint</em> – taking a closer look at how Jesus went about making disciples</p>
<p>•<em>What Are You Reproducing?</em> – an insightful reflection that reveals what our lives are currently really reproducing</p>

<h2><strong>More of My Story and Vision For Discipleship</strong></h2>
<p>Have you ever been “ruined for the ordinary” by something someone said – a passing comment, an unusual insight or words spoken directly to you that resonated deep inside and marked your life? I had such an occurrence – a divine moment that shaped my life – at 40,000 feet in the air between Los Angeles and Washington D.C. in April of 1980.</p>
<p>At the time, I was 20 years old, living in Kona, Hawaii and serving with Youth With A Mission (YWAM). My day-to-day responsibilities (and part of my own discipleship) revolved around leading a youth ministry known as “Acts 2”. I had the privilege of leading a team of very capable young adults that engaged in weekly ministry on eight high school campuses around the Big Island. To fuel what we were doing on the campuses we hosted quarterly “advances” that allowed us to bring students from all of our lunch-time campus clubs together for weekends of discipleship. Each summer we also hosted several Acts 2 Discipleship Camps where we spent eight hours each day discipling students--and their youth pastors--in the ways of God. It was exciting for me and my team to watch Jesus touch and transform so many lives as youth groups gathered for these two-week intensives in Hawaii and other locations on the U.S. mainland.</p>
<p>One day in the early Spring of 1980, I was approached by Peter Jordan, a godly leader from Canada and friend, who served as the personal assistant to YWAM’s Founder, Loren Cunningham. He wondered if I would be open to praying about doing some traveling with Loren on an upcoming trip that would take him from Dallas to Los Angeles and then on to Washington D.C. I understood that my role on the trip would be very simple: be available to help Loren when called upon and anticipate ways to serve. I was honored to be asked and committed to Peter to seek the Lord about it and get back to him shortly. I’ll just say it didn’t take long for Jesus to give me a green light!</p>
<p>While having a conversation with Loren on one of our flights, he asked me a question: “Dave, what do you think your spiritual gifts are?” To be honest, at 20 years of age I was still in the process of figuring that out for myself! I hemmed and hawed a bit, taking my best shot at it based on the results of a gift assessment I had recently used with my team.</p>
<p>Loren had observed me leading our youth ministry in Kona for several years. In light of that, he began to share with me what he thought my gifts were and some practical ways to grow and develop them. Then, he spoke the following words, and with them came my “ruined for the ordinary” moment:</p>
<p>“You know, Dave, it really isn’t important how big the organizations are that you will lead, or the size of the groups that you will teach. The way that God will measure the fruitfulness of your life is have you invested to the third and fourth generations.”</p>
<p>He’d already had my attention but now I was really locked in! He began to explain to me that he was not speaking of generations usually divided in to 40-year increments, but rather, the generations referred to in 2 Timothy 2:2 where (1) Paul discipled (2) Timothy who invested in (3) faithful men, who then passed on what they received to (4) others.</p>
<p>Not fully realizing it at the moment, I had just been envisioned with a four-generational model of disciple-making, and along with that, had received a practical way of how Jesus would measure the fruitfulness of my life and ministry! Talk about a game changer!</p>
<p>From that moment in time until this present one, those words from Jesus through Loren have significantly shaped my life and calling. Reproducing disciples who reproduce others is my primary reference point for fruitfulness. Am I (first generation) so discipling Stan (second generation) that the truths he is learning are being fully incarnated within his own life? Is he, in turn, pouring the same into Marty (third generation) who then invests in Barry (fourth generation)?</p>
<p>On and on it goes, as each one disciples another: impacting people, families, domains of society, entire nations and multiple generations, in perpetuity! The Jesus blueprint is simple: it’s disciples of Jesus deliberately reproducing disciples who do the same. It’s the primary way He intended His kingdom ways and mission to be imparted and reproduced. It’s what He’s commissioned us to do until we see Him face-to-face! </p>
<p>My hope is that this book, The Jesus Blueprint will help many other followers of Jesus to commit to making disciple-makers.</p>

<p>Ciao a tutti, sono Jacopo Berti, un giovane imprenditore padovano di 31 anni, laureato in <b>giurisprudenza</b>, co-fondatore di una società che opera in supporto alle aziende, nel campo della business intelligence, digital export e soluzioni di vendita omnicanale.
Sono un giovane che ha assistito all’inesorabile frenata di quella che un tempo veniva chiamata con orgoglio la “<b>locomotiva d’Italia</b>” - il nostro amato Veneto - non solo a causa di fattori esterni (<b>crisi economica</b>), ma anche interni (<b>corruzione</b>, <b>speculazioni</b> su opere pubbliche, scandalo MOSE, etc.).</p>
<p>Da quando sono diventato attivista del <b>MoVimento 5 Stelle</b>, nella mia mente si è delineato un sogno, condiviso da tutti gli altri attivisti. Un sogno di un Veneto libero da corruzione e malaffare, libero da sprechi di denaro ma con <b>nuove risorse</b> per le persone che lo abitano. Un Veneto più <b>equo</b> e più rispettoso della <b>dignità</b> dei suoi cittadini.</p>
<p>Noi crediamo che a questo sogno debba essere concessa l’opportunità di vedersi realizzato - anche con un tuo piccolo aiuto.
</p>
<h3>Cosa vogliamo fare con il tuo supporto</h3>
<p>Noi Veneti andiamo fieri del nostro motto “<i>muso duro e barèta fracà</i>”: la voglia di lavorare non ci è mai mancata, ci siamo sempre rimboccati le maniche e abbiamo fatto sacrifici per i nostri figli, per le nostre famiglie, senza renderci conto che mentre eravamo indaffarati a guadagnarci il pane a testa bassa, qualcuno stava piano piano chiudendo i forni.</p>
<p>La <b>cattiva politica</b>, l’<b>egoismo</b> di pochi, non hanno avuto pietà di un popolo che ha reso grande il Veneto - in Italia e nel Mondo.
Quindi adesso fermiamoci un attimo - alziamo la testa - fermiamo questo scempio. Non è più sufficiente il nostro duro lavoro. Dobbiamo chiedere indietro la dignità che ci è stata tolta.</p>
<p>Questi sono i pensieri che mi hanno spinto a candidarmi alle prossime <b>elezioni</b> <b>regionali</b> e a diventare il <b>candidato Presidente della Regione Veneto</b> per il <b>Movimento 5 stelle</b>, assieme ad altri 51 candidati consiglieri.
Il nostro obiettivo è di portare in regione delle persone <b>oneste</b>, <b>incensurate</b> e <b>competenti</b> che possano riportare gli organi regionali a lavorare efficientemente al servizio dei <b>cittadini</b>, delle <b>imprese</b>, dei <b>lavoratori</b>.</p>
<h3>Perché abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto</h3>
<p>Come forse saprai, il MoVimento 5 stelle rifiuta il <b>finanziamento</b> <b>pubblico</b> destinato ai partiti e i <b>rimborsi</b> <b>elettorali</b>, perché crediamo che questi siano una forma coercitiva di “donazioni” che il cittadino è costretto a fare contro la sua volontà con le proprie tasse - nonostante per il finanziamento pubblico sia stato indetto un referendum in cui il popolo italiano decise che dovesse essere abolito.</p>
<p>Noi preferiamo quindi chiedere delle <b>donazioni</b> <b>volontarie</b>, da parte di chi condivide le nostre <b>idee</b> e il nostro <b>sogno</b>, e vuole contribuire anche in modo simbolico a tenere viva la fiamma della speranza in un <b>cambiamento</b>.
I fondi raccolti saranno impiegati per farci conoscere, per informare tutte le persone che di noi hanno sentito poco parlare - o a cui è stata presentata un’immagine distorta di noi e poco aderente alla realtà dei fatti.</p>
<p>Ricorda, anche una piccola donazione può fare la differenza.<br/>
Sogna... <i>Alza la testa</i>... Sei con noi?</p>
<p>Grazie per aver letto il nostro messaggio.</p>

La cattiva politica, l’egoismo di pochi, non hanno avuto pietà di un popolo che ha reso grande il Veneto - in Italia e nel Mondo.
Quindi adesso fermiamoci un attimo - alziamo la testa - fermiamo questo scempio. Non è più sufficiente il nostro duro lavoro. Dobbiamo chiedere indietro la dignità che ci è stata tolta.
Questi sono i pensieri che mi hanno spinto a candidarmi alle prossime elezioni regionali e a diventare il candidato Presidente della Regione Veneto per il Movimento 5 stelle, assieme ad altri 51 candidati consiglieri.
Il nostro obiettivo è di portare in regione delle persone oneste, incensurate e competenti che possano riportare gli organi regionali a lavorare efficientemente al servizio dei cittadini, delle imprese, dei lavoratori.
Perché abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto
Come forse saprai, il MoVimento 5 stelle rifiuta il finanziamento pubblico destinato ai partiti e i rimborsi elettorali, perché crediamo che questi siano una forma coercitiva di “donazioni” che il cittadino è costretto a fare contro la sua volontà con le proprie tasse - nonostante per il finanziamento pubblico sia stato indetto un referendum in cui il popolo italiano decise che dovesse essere abolito.
Noi preferiamo quindi chiedere delle donazioni volontarie, da parte di chi condivide le nostre idee e il nostro sogno, e vuole contribuire anche in modo simbolico a tenere viva la fiamma della speranza in un cambiamento.
I fondi raccolti saranno impiegati per farci conoscere, per informare tutte le persone che di noi hanno sentito poco parlare - o a cui è stata presentata un’immagine distorta di noi e poco aderente alla realtà dei fatti.
Ricorda, anche una piccola donazione può fare la differenza.
Sogna... Alza la testa... Sei con noi?
Grazie per aver letto il nostro messaggio.

Telephone Magazine is a Dayton, OH based print publication.

When we began distribution in March of 2013, we chose to focus on bringing essays, interviews, art, photography, DIY projects, music reviews, and the occasional science and technology articles to our readers. <div>
<br/><div>
<div>
Early in the process of developing Telephone Magazine it was obvious that including work from <strong>local, regional and international artists</strong> was a great idea. And while Telephone's priority is Dayton-area artists, our vision isn't geographically limited. </div>
<div>We quickly began featuring and curating work from the region, nationally and feature internationally curated work as well. This allows us to offer contrasting visions, and a much broader artistic context.<br/><div>
<br/><div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Your donations will help us continue publication and build the foundation for exciting projects that we have in store for the future! </b>

<p>Precisely. We aspire to produce original online content (coverage of events/short films/documentaries/interviews/animation/digital art/video art++) and to expand our organization to include mentorship and resident artist programs. This is not only an effort to create content for the magazine (we believe that will be a natural outcome of the process) but to provide a valuable resource for creatives in the community. <br/></p>
<h2>WHAT DO YOU NEED AND WHY?</h2>We need $18,000 to rebuild our operational capital and to invest in production tools. For nearly a year, each issue of the magazine was created by a team of people working remotely when time and space allowed it. Meeting only bi-weekly to bring all of the content together and create the issue worked for a time, but presented us with challenges. We have the office space. Now we need the equipment. Through a few key investments, we can sustain an effective production process, but more importantly, foster growth in both our publication and in the lives that it touches.<p></p>

Telephone Magazine is a Dayton, OH based print publication.

When we began distribution in March of 2013, we chose to focus on bringing essays, interviews, art, photography, DIY projects, music reviews, and the occasional science and technology articles to our readers. 


Early in the process of developing Telephone Magazine it was obvious that including work from local, regional and international artists was a great idea. And while Telephone's priority is Dayton-area artists, our vision isn't geographically limited. 
We quickly began featuring and curating work from the region, nationally and feature internationally curated work as well. This allows us to offer contrasting visions, and a much broader artistic context.

Your donations will help us continue publication and build the foundation for exciting projects that we have in store for the future!

All right, you're off to a good start! What's in store for the future?
Having a broad spectrum of in house production capabilities will allow us to offer resources to the community at large at little to no cost. You don't need a large budget or be a student.
Telephone was founded on 'sweat equity' - all you need is a good idea, the willingness to do the work and learn.


Internships & community access: to a variety of digital tools (digital still & video cameras, Adobe Creative Cloud, Avid Media Composer, animation software and more).

Mentorship programs: local professionals and educators offering workshops, tutorials and feedback on projects created in-house using Telephone resources. 


Original online content: featuring a wide variety of classic and new media.


Increased coverage of local & regional events: bands in bars, local film, outdoor and not-for-profit  events will be a major part of the first wave of changes to take place in early Oct. 2014

We work toward these simple and humble goals: to be conscious, to be actively involved in the community, to inform, to entertain and to have fun doing it!
If you'd like to know more feel free to give me a ring 937-580-8551-Kerry D. Brown, Editor-in-Chief


 
Precisely. We aspire to produce original online content (coverage of events/short films/documentaries/interviews/animation/digital art/video art++) and to expand our organization to include mentorship and resident artist programs. This is not only an effort to create content for the magazine (we believe that will be a natural outcome of the process) but to provide a valuable resource for creatives in the community. 
WHAT DO YOU NEED AND WHY?We need $18,000 to rebuild our operational capital and to invest in production tools. For nearly a year, each issue of the magazine was created by a team of people working remotely when time and space allowed it. Meeting only bi-weekly to bring all of the content together and create the issue worked for a time, but presented us with challenges. We have the office space. Now we need the equipment. Through a few key investments, we can sustain an effective production process, but more importantly, foster growth in both our publication and in the lives that it touches.

No Clip Art! We take pride in matching each essay/article with a custom illustration or photograph- created by a local artist or photographer- usually on a 48 hour deadline!

No Syndicated Content! Our content is all original and always will be! We've worked hard to develop our content from relationships throughout the community and beyond!

<p><b>In Short:</b></p>
<p>June 1st we leave! For three months, my partner Sara and I
will be riding our bicycles from Portland, Oregon to 'the coast', Virginia. It
will be funny, hard, and above all exciting, and I will take copious notes, and
next thing you know, I've written a zine that you might love. Probably. It will
be my sixth! Next Stop Adventure #6! 4300 miles of AHHHHHH!</p><p><b>Some Quick Background</b></p>
<p>My name is Matt Gauck, as I’m sure you got from the video.
I’m a vegan, bike-touring illustrator, in three adjectives. I have been touring
for about 12 years now, and writing about it for almost as long. In that time,
I’ve covered roughly 4000 total miles, comprising 5 zines, detailing the
adventures I’ve run into, and I’ve self published them under the name “<i>Next Stop Adventure</i>”. I’m told they are
both funny and inspiring, which is always what I’m aiming for. I’m also steeped
heavily in the DIY scene, which comes out in my writing style, as well as my
insistence to avoid all the trappings of sponsorship or endorsement deals, etc.
</p>
<p>This campaign is the best way to try to get some attention
around my zine writing, while helping Sara and I not starve to death in the
process, which is nice. Our goal is set at 4000 dollars as sort of a ‘guess’ of
what would be helpful. I rode 1000 miles in Alaska a couple years back, and
managed to raise about 1200 dollars, and this upcoming trip is 4 times as long,
so, well, do the math! </p>
<p>Mostly, if you can help this campaign along, you will be
the proud owner of a piece of real, personal history with ‘Next Stop Adventure
#6’. We’re going to do this trip either way; this is simply a platform to get
some stuff out of helping us. I like forging connections to people, and this is
an effective method, so far as I can tell. </p>
<p><b>ADDITIONALLY</b> we’ll be doing some
‘tour stops’ on the way, and once our route is down, I’ll update this
occasionally to let you know where our ‘shows’ will be. Come see me read in
real life! Throw bananas at me if I suck! Get them into my mouth or a smoothie
if I’m good!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/450199/files/20140321114917-forthepitch.jpg?1395427757"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This is the cover of the BOOK that's coming out in May, collecting my first 5 zines! Yes, I drew it also. I draw everything!<p></p>
<p><b>Where Your Money Goes</b></p>
<p>In my pocket! Haha but
seriously – Any and all money we can raise will go mostly to food costs and
emergency bike issues. Beyond that, the money you contribute will directly fund
the incentive/prizes that you’re choosing. Zines, patches, artwork, t-shirts, posters
– think of this like ‘pre-buying’ stuff, it makes way more sense that way.</p>
<p><b>Seriously, Another Bike Touring Zine?</b></p>
<p>Yep. But trust me, mine is good. I mean, I’m 32 years old
- I know what I’m doing!</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>So yeah, I’m not on facebook, and I don’t even have the
internet at my house, (much less on my out of date flip phone) which means if
you could forward this link, post on facebook about it, tell your friends and
enemies at work / school / the store / over there, or anything ANYTHING like
that, I would be so appreciative. Just paste this link around: <b><a href=""http://igg.me/at/nextstopadventure"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/at/nextstopadventure</a></b></p>
<p><b>Coming To Your Town…?</b></p>
<p>So once I have the route all “figured out for real”, I’ll
be posting it here, and a couple other places online, and then I’ll be booking
a handful of ‘shows’ wherein I read aloud from old zines I wrote, sell merch,
etc etc. If you live in any of the towns close to our stops and want to come
out and say hi, hang out, bring vegan cookies – please feel free! Making new
friends is what tour is…well, I was going to say ‘all about’, but it’s more of
a huge perk. I’m very friendly, as is Sara, and we love swapping stories.</p>
<p><b>Questions?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>FAQ #1: </b>What if I want some of one prize and
some of another one?</p>
<p>Answer: I am very
laid back, and willing to figure something out for you. Do your best to go without
my help, knowing that whatever extra you may pay will go to help us defray
costs of shipping, using indiegogo, and eating dinner that night. But if you
really want one thing coupled with another and can’t make it cost efficient,
lemme know! My contact is below!</p>
<p>Please write! I respond to everything. Except spam. Well,
at least not on purpose. </p>

GOURMET KUSHBOOK V.1
Legalize It!  Be careful what you wish for…. Herban Gourmet
“Kushbook” the comprehensive guide to cooking with Cannabis.  To healing… to happiness… to Healthy Hightimes!

of Cannabis candies, snacks, and beverages is geared toward the conscious
cannabis culture. Based on over a decade of success in the Cannabis foodstuffs
industry and mentors in Cannabis Reform, Peachtree Norml, assisting in cannabis
education and political reform.  We have
created Medicinal Munchie Madness! 
Welcome to, the Herban Gourmet Kushbook series, volume
1. Also includes youtube ""Chef Kush"" cooking segments. Kushbook is self-published, illustrated, and video produced, your
generous contributions and pre-buys of Herban Gourmet will support our mission to
educate consumers about Edibles and the medicinal benefits.  For future publications submit your favorite
Cannabis recipe, get published now! 
Doctors recommend that
people make cannabis a part of their everyday diet. The plant does not need to
contain high levels of THC and it can simply be hemp.  If we view the plant simple as a vegetable
like all other vegetables we eat, it makes sense that we wouldn’t put it inside
rolling papers, blunts, bongs, vaporizers and smoke it to get the nutritional
benefits.BUD + BUTTER = BUDDERThe
Purpose:
The mission of the Herban Gourmet Kushbook is to help people empower
themselves, knowledge is power! Learn what Cannabinoids are and what role they
play in the generation and regeneration of the immune system. Contrary to popular thought and
belief, smoking the cannabis does not assist a great deal in treating disease.  Creating oil from the plant or eating the
plant is the best way to go about getting the necessary ingredients
which are the cannabinoids.
The Kushbook
is designed for people who do not adhere to a singular food tradition, the
Kushbook is intended for those who embrace an open experimental and adaptable
approach to choosing which foods, snacks, and beverages may be the most
healing.The Contents

What
were we thinking?
Of course the Hydropops journey has not been easy.  We produce very controversial products and we
are aware of that fact.  The mission of Hydropops - Amsterdam Candy Company is to
promote the Decriminalization &
Industrialization of Medicinal & Hemp/Cannabis products.  Also a push to stop the War on Drugs!  We work closely with Peachtree Nomrl in
Atlanta Georgia to achieve these goals. 
Hydropops has been our voice to help champion this cause.  Hydropops aligns itself with Festivals,
Tours, Political events, and Organizations that support the Hydropops -
Amsterdam Candy Company agenda. 
Method to the Madness
We have always fought for the Legalization of Marijuana
and finally the day has come!  Thanks to Colorado,
Washington, California and all medicinal states for your commitment.  The creation of Herban Gourmet “Kushbook” Series
was just a natural progression from the makers of Hydropops.  Our track record has qualified us as the Authority
in the Cannabis Foodstuffs Industry.  No competitors even come close!   Now we offer a publication for medicinal foods, snacks, and
beverages to our customers.  We are
very excited about the possibilities of the current and future publications
with your financial and recipe submission assistance.
How We will Invest Your Money?
All monies received will be use to develop and print the book (edtiting, layout, graphics, video, etc.), fulfill backer rewards, and account for all of the legal and processing fees (copyrights, ISBN #, publishing, shipping, etc.)  If we go beyond our goal we hope to launch a Marketing, Promotional, and PR campaign.
Risk & Challenges
The risk is little to none!  Hydropops/Amsterdam Candy has been in
business for 13 successful years.  Our competitors
are none!   No one really has the
Balls!  Very few products and
publications exist addressing this subject matter.
Our biggest challenge currently is supply and
demand.  We have more demand for
products, vending opportunities, and employment (Herban Chef’s) than we can
handle.  We need inventory (books) and
marketing materials desperately!  The
Hydropops/Herban Gourmet mission has only begun with 20 medicinal states and
more to come.  We look forward to another
successful launch of an extremely relevant “Kushbook”.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-ZA""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-ZA"">In 2007, in South Africa, hundreds of
families living in shacks in the township of Delft in Cape Town were moved into
houses they had been promised at the end of apartheid. But soon they were
told that the move had been illegal and they were kicked out of their new
homes. They built shacks next to the road opposite the housing project and
organized themselves into the Symphony Way Anti-Eviction Campaign, refusing to
move into a crime-ridden ‘Temporary Relocation Area’ called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blikkiesdorp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Blikkiesdorp </a>and vowing to stay on the road until
the government gave them permanent housing.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-ZA""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span lang=""EN-ZA"">Written toward the end of the struggle on
the pavements, this anthology is both testimony and poetry. There are stories
of justice miscarried, of violence, of bigotry and xenophobia. But amid the
horror there is beauty, and a bundle of relationships between aunties,

About This project:
 
The aim of this project is to bring three authors of the acclaimed book No Land! No House!
No Vote! Voices from Symphony Way on a tour of the USA and the UK.
 
A group of families who have called
themselves the Symphony Way Pavement Dwellers are demanding that their voices
are heard and they need your help to bring them to your city:
 
London
New York
Boston
Philadelphia
Washington DC
Chicago
San Francisco
Ottawa
Los Angeles


 
 
Synopsis:
 
In 2007, in South Africa, hundreds of
families living in shacks in the township of Delft in Cape Town were moved into
houses they had been promised at the end of apartheid. But soon they were
told that the move had been illegal and they were kicked out of their new
homes. They built shacks next to the road opposite the housing project and
organized themselves into the Symphony Way Anti-Eviction Campaign, refusing to
move into a crime-ridden ‘Temporary Relocation Area’ called Blikkiesdorp and vowing to stay on the road until
the government gave them permanent housing.
 
Written toward the end of the struggle on
the pavements, this anthology is both testimony and poetry. There are stories
of justice miscarried, of violence, of bigotry and xenophobia. But amid the
horror there is beauty, and a bundle of relationships between aunties,
husbands, wives and children, of daughters named ‘Hope’ and ‘Symphony’. This
book is a means to dignity, a way for the poor to reflect and be reflected. It
is testimony that there is thinking in the shacks, that there are complex humans who dialogue, theorise and fight to
bring about change. This book is an expression of that fight.
 
Voices from Symphony Way is a unique book
from a unique struggle.  With a
Foreword written by award winning writer and activist Raj Patel, it seeks to
place itself in the center of the global struggle for land and hosing for the
poor.


 
Why is a book tour important?
 
The release of No Land! No House! No Vote!
By the Symphony Way Pavement Dwellers has generated huge interest in South
Africa and across the globe. 
Organizations and universities from all over want to hear the authors
speak about their struggle. A tour in the US would help spread the word about
the struggle for land, housing and dignity in South Africa.  
 
A number of US media outlets have expressed
significant interest in interviewing the authors if we are able to put together
the tour.  These include Democracy
Now!, AllAfrica.com, the Nation, NPR, The Real News, WBAI, Pacifica Radio, and
Left Turn Magazine.  There is also
interest for them to speak at events at the University of Chicago, at the
University of North Carolina, Duke, MIT, Harvard, University of
Milwaukee-Wisconson, Busboys and Poets, University of California at Berkeley,
UCLA, Carlton University, and more. 

 
This would generate significant interest
and support for the struggles of South African shack-dwellers.
 
It is also important because it will show
another side of the struggle: the struggle against the mainstream media and
publishing industry that seeks to silence (or mediate) the voices of the poor
throughout the world. This book tour would be an important way of challenging the
status quo of who deserves the media spotlight.
 
 

Proposed budget:
 
In order to bring three authors, we will
need to raise $6,830 dollars for passports, visas and airfare from South
Africa. 
 
The rest of the costs (accommodation,
internal US/UK travel, and food) will be covered by the organizations,
Universities, and bookstores that are bringing the authors to speak.
 
Here are some details on the costs (airfare
cost is an estimate):
 
3x tickets to New York with Layover in
London:  $5,400.00
3x passports for authors:     $174
3x visas for authors (UK):     $390
3x visas for authors (US):     $420
subcost:       $6,384.00 
(plus Indiegogo 7% admin fee)
Total cost: $6830.00
 
Note: Every effort will be made to raise the funds necessary. If all funds are not raised, alternative rewards may be provided.

Hello, my name is Marie-Sol St-Onge. I am a 35 year old Artist . In 2011, I founded  my own artistic painting company, The Illusarts.
The event that changed the course of my life
On March 8, 2012, I was hospitalized with a severe pneumonia. Doctors quickly diagnosed septic shock due to an attack from a flesh eating bacteria spreading like a lightning bolt. On April 22, 2012 I had to have the amputation of both of my legs and then …a few days later, I lost both of my arms.
I am a Mother of two boys aged 5 and 8. I am an Artist passionate about her work, and a dedicated wife. Our lives, mine and my family, were completely turned upside down. Never again, will I ever be able to hold, in my hands, a brush that was until March 8, 2012, my working tool. Never again, will I ever be able to take care of my children the same way. They and my husband, Alin, will be the ones carrying me in their arms.
Rehabilitation
I chose to stay positive and optimistic about my future and I'm rapidly going ahead with rehabilitation. In less than a year, I successfully walk again without crutches with the help of prostheses .I regained a lot of autonomy in learning how  to use a myoelectric greifer. I also received a high-tech prosthesis for my right hand. Once home, and somewhat, in control of my life, I realized I would greatly benefit from the performance and the natural look of a left hand  to complete my daily tasks.
Fundraising
This fundraising campaign will help me raise the money required to purchase an I-Limb left hand which will allow me to get on with my life.
Thank you just seems so little…
This hand up would mean the world to me. In appreciation of your donation, I offer you a copy of my first painted canvas with my prostheses called Renaissance.

Présentation
Bonjour, je m’appelle Marie-Sol St-Onge. Je suis une artiste peintre de 35 ans et j’ai fondé en 2011 ma propre entreprise de peinture artistique, Les Illusarts.
L’évènement qui changea le cours de ma vie
Le 8 mars 2012 j'ai été hospitalisée pour une pneumonie sévère. Rapidement les médecins diagnostiquèrent un choc septique dû à une attaque foudroyante de la bactérie mangeuse de chair.
Le 22 avril je fut amputée des deux jambes puis quelques jours plus tard, je me faisais amputer les deux bras.
Mère de deux garçons de 5 et 8 ans, artiste peintre, épouse dévouée et passionnée par mon travail, ma vie et celle de ma famille a complètement basculée. Jamais plus je ne pourrai tenir entre mes mains un pinceau qui était jusqu’au 8 mars 2012, mon outil de travail. Jamais plus je ne pourrai m’occuper de mes enfants de la même façon. Ce sont eux et Alin mon conjoint qui devront me porter à bout de bras.
Réadaptation
J’ai choisie de rester positive et optimiste face à mon avenir et je me suis lancée à toute allure dans la réadaptation. 
En moins de 1 an, j’ai réussie à marcher à nouveau, sans béquilles, avec de bonnes prothèses et j’ai regagné beaucoup d’autonomie en opérant mes pinces myo-électrique. J’ai également obtenue une prothèse de haute technologie pour ma main droite. De retour à la maison aux commandes de ma vie, je réalise le besoin au quotidien d'avoir une main gauche pareille à celle de droite qui est si performante et d'allure beaucoup plus naturelle.
Levée de fond
Cette campagne de financement à pour but d’amasser l'argent nécessaire qui servira à l'achat d'une main gauche I-Limb pour me permettre de reprendre le cours de ma vie.
Merci infiniment
C’est avec vos nombreux coup de pouce que vous me donnerez ce coup de main tant espéré. En guise de remerciement, je vous offre une reproduction de ma première toile peinte avec mes prothèses nommé Renaissance.

<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p><em>Do you love Gundam model kits? Are you frustrated at the lack of English language books and resources for building magazine quality kits at home?</em></p>
<p>Over the last 30 years building Gundam model kits has been a wildly popular hobby in Japan and East Asia. Every year dozens of new kits are released to the enjoyment of young kids and experienced mecha modelers all over the world, and every year more and more people in the western world catch the mecha bug.</p>
<p>And while ordering the model kits straight from Japan has become much easier, the vast array of mecha related books and magazines have stayed out of reach of non-Japanese speaking fans. This has left a large audience of mecha maniacs high and dry of resources for building unique, and customized model kits like those seen so often in Japanese hobby magazines.</p>
<p><em>Our project aims to change that by releasing one of the first ever mecha modeling how-to books completely in English, in a highly professional format.<br/></em></p>
<p>The <strong>Mecha Modeling Guide for Beginners</strong> is the first book in a proposed trilogy of English language instructional guides for building better Gunpla, from the beginner to the intermediate and advanced modeler.</p>
<p>The book will include build ups of four popular model kits by veteran modelers, teaching the skills and techniques needed to make the kits along the way. Starting with the basic skills of snapping and gluing, we will show and describe in detail the proper techniques for preparing a great looking kit out-of-the-box, with a minimum of tools, all the way to a kit fully painted with inexpensive spray paint and art pens.</p>
<h3><strong>Kits Featured in the Book</strong></h3>
<p>*may change due to circumstance<strong><br/></strong></p>

<li>1/100 Deathscythe Hell Custom 50</li>
<li>1/144 HG Exia ??? 40</li>
<li>1/144 HGUC RX-78-2 Gundam 26</li>
<li>1/100 Phantom Blaze Zaku 60</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to buy two of each kit, in order to show the stock kit against the completed ones.</p>
<p>Along with the build ups, the reader will also find and introduction and history of mecha modeling, a gloassary and grade guide, in depth descriptions of the different tools and products used in Gunpla, as well as detailed descriptions of tricks and techniques for building, painting and finishing your kits.</p>
<h3><strong>About the Authors</strong></h3>
<p>The book is being written by three award-winning, experienced mecha modelers and two dedicated beginners. All of the authors belong to Vanpla, the Vancouver Mecha Model Club, one of the premier Gunpla groups on the western seaboard, dedicated to teaching and promoting the mecha model hobby.</p>
<p>Together we are all very passionate about our hobby, and this book is our attempt to improve the available resources to new hobbyists, and give the next generation a leg up that we never had.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To complete the book, we need funding to pay for the kits and tools we plan to feature. We require 2 kits of each model we plan to feature, one to build up and one for comparison shots afterwards, and we also need some new tools and supplies for photographing and use on the kits (we all have supplies, but they are pretty abused looking and not great for instructional purposes).</p>
<h3>Cost Breakdown</h3>
<p><strong>$176 for kits<br/>$150 for tools and paints<br/>$300 for website development</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What Are We Going to Do With Extra Money?</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Perks</strong></h3>
<p><em>The perks can be seen to the right of this text. They include:</em></p>
<p><strong>Special thanks in the book, and a shout out on the group Facebook and Twitter.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Custom decal sheet (only available through this campaign)<br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>Hard cover version of the finished book</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributions from <em>viewers like you</em> are the only way we will be able to produce this book. It is our hope that if the e-book is successful we will be able to show publishers and distributors there is a market for similar mecha modeling books in English. It is our goal to open the floodgates to new original books, and hopefully translations of popular Japanese guides for the growing western audience of Gunpla enthusiasts.</p>

<h3>Short tasty bits</h3>
<p>Underneath The Juniper Tree (UTJT) began in June, 2011. Since then we've been collecting a tasty smorgasbord of writing and artwork that tantalizes and terrifies children and adults alike. Our contributors range from children to adults, nobodies to somebodies and everything in between, all with the talent to scare us. </p>
<p>We would like to showcase these amazing writers and artists from all over the world by printing an anthology of our favourite pieces since UTJT set its roots.</p>
<p>We know it's important for new creatives to have their work become a tangible piece of their passion that they can hold with pride. Please help us support the incredible work of these people in our 2011-2012 Anthology.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What will this piece of finery look like?</h3>
<p>Printing costs are key in this project. We don't want to make just another magazine or compilation of images and words. We want the actual product to be a piece of work in and of itself. </p>
<p>If we meet our goal, we will be embossing the cover of our Anthology to give it a subtle and dark look that resounds in the work and very being of Underneath The Juniper Tree.</p>
<p>We will have cover-to-cover full colour artwork to accompany the incredible stories within. Go big or go home!</p>
<p>We will have a perfect bound spine, which will not only look super chic and professional, but will allow us to put the name and date of the Anthology on the spine.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Who does what?</h3>
<p>Underneath The Juniper Tree is run by two volunteers, artist Rebekah Joy Plett and litarary agent Bree Ogden. Both have full-time careers and various part-time jobs in order to allow them to do what they love. Underneath The Juniper Tree is a passion of the heart and they will do what it takes to succeed.</p>
<p>All our contributors take time outside their jobs and lives to create the horrifically wonderful pieces that we publish in our online magazine. We want to give back by showcasing some of our favourite pieces in this anthology.</p>
<h3>What else can you do to help?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Just knowing that others are loving what we're doing is a lot of encouragement, so when we receive emails and messages on Facebook and Twitter that support our creation, it motivates us to work even harder. </p>
<p>You can visit us on our Facebook page, ""like"" us and send us a comment. Or you can follow us on Twitter and see what sort of ghoulish things we're up to. Also, feel free to send us your scary stories and artwork! We are always taking new submissions. </p>
<p>Lastly, spread the word! We've amassed our fans simply by word of mouth. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support and encouragement since that fateful day in June 2011! </p>

He seemed to have everything, as yet something was making him suffer deeply.  So why is this happening?<br/></p>
<p>Guilt is the number one reason for people feeling stuck in their lives, for feeling stress and also creating years of unnecessary suffering. The main reasons for all of this internal suffering is feeling guilty about something of the past, or about something we believe is wrong. Some of the impacts are not that obvious, and I would like you to think about them: if you are feeling guilty of having more money than your parents, would you get more? If you are feeling guilty of being happy, while others are depressed, would you be OK being happy?<br/></p>
<p>Most people never really thought about Guilt in this way, but I know, from my own experience, how <b>one guilty feeling, repressed for years, completely unconscious, created more than 4.5 years of pain, suffering, nearly depression, no income, no job (despite an amazing CV), no relationship. How many other people are suffering from this? How many children are suffering because their parents are feeling this guilt? </b></p>
<p>Being a single dad, I understand this, and I am, at times, feeling guilty for my daughter too, as for years, I could not offer her what she asked for, and I was so scared, that at times, I could not be present for her: so no treats and no presence... </p>
<p>But, a little bit more about me, I am Bertrand Dory, and I am passionate about helping people getting a better life, and empowering them to express their full authentic presence and greatness. I am an international radio host, the best seller author of ""conversations for your soul"", the founder of several businesses, one being ""Design your Dream Life"". I am also an inspirational speaker, and a technologist and mathematician by education. ... and the dad of a wonderful girl, of 14 years of age. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One day, I had this calling to explore Guilt as a feeling (more for getting myself unstuck in my own life) and to dig deeper. What I discovered was amazing: we are all suffering from it, because we are immersed in a society that creates guilt, and we all have said or done (or not said or done) things we regret. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our parents, friends, romantic partners, children, big corporations, governments, medias, religious figures, even employers are also using guilt to get what they want from us: love, acceptance, spending, compliance. And we are using these tools too, for acceptance and control mainly. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have our own personal guilts! And this feeling is something that we cannot really accept, as it is conscience-based, and feeling guilt about something we value wrong is also impacting how we value ourselves, and this creates a lot of issues of self-esteem, self-worth and confidence.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When I am speaking about this subject to audiences, people are awakening and embracing this aspect of themselves, and there is a light that goes on, there is hope in their eyes, and tears… tears of hope, of joy, of past pains.  The most memorable ones are a lady of around 70, who, all her life, felt guilty of not being a good mother to her children. She looked frail and broken when I first saw her, and then, there was a relief and she left with the most beautiful smile of inner peace. Another talk, and there was this very big man, far taller and stronger than me. I could see years of pain, because of the hardness of his job in the military forces. He was a hard and a real man, and yet, he got tears in his eyes. For the first time, in more than 40 years, he got to make this part of him and his experience OK for him, and this was like a ton of guilt, shame, pain, regrets lifted in a moment. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And this is one of the key reasons I want to share this book and write it: a lot of people are suffering from it, and they do not know this or they carry so much burden or they do not want to feel this guilt.<b> So, it gets repressed, it is untold, it is unshared, and one day, it is triggered, and when it is triggered, it creates huge suffering for the person, months of pains and struggle, and it impacts everybody around them. </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I have been in this situation. When I had a great life, you know what I mean: an amazing job, a great income, a wonderful romance, peace, a sense of belonging i life, contribution to others and pride for me,<b> I would never have thought that I was carrying any form of guilt</b>. Of course, I was feeling some of my limitations, but this life was … something different. I was feeling like in a real dream. <b>And a guilt was triggered, something long repressed and completely forgotten, and my life crashed uncontrollably: one event after an other, and I said hurtful words (that I regret), I behaved like an idiot, I sabotaged everything. And this lasted for over 4 years of fears, struggles, unhappiness, no real relationship. I was lost, alone, filled with shame and guilt and struggling with my inner emotions every single day.</b> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>This is what Guilt does to you: it sabotages your life, so that you are not faced with the idea that you are a bad person.</b> The most extraordinary aspect is that <b>it is not conscious, it is insidious, it is repressed</b>, and we feel we cannot share what we feel with the world.<b> And this is my mission in life to share this, create new perspectives for people, help them to free themselves and finally live a free-er, more empowered and wonderful life</b>. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Join me to make this project of a book a reality</b>. With this funding,<b> I can get the book self-published with Balboa Press, which allows me to reach a worldwide audience</b> and serve people in the world with this information. It is also a division of Hay House Publishing, which opens the chance of being published by Hay House and leverage their network to get the book to people I cannot and will never reach without them.<b> I will avail of a great editor who can take my information and help me to organise it, and use a better English than I can</b>. Even if my English is good, I am not a native speaker, and I want this book to be of the best possible editorial quality. Finally,<b> it will allow myself to invest more time to further my research and even conduct surveys with people to supplement the assumptions</b> and ideas already documented in the book. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My feeling is that this is <b>also</b> going to become an audio book and a Video Fiction/Documentary (a little bit like “What the Bleep do we know?”).  </p>
<p><b>The <i>minimum</i> budget I have calculated for this phase of the publishing is $6,000 </b>($10,000 would really help me making sen a bigger impact).</p>

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>When I started talking about Guilt, it was very uncomfortable, and I received some feedback that nobody is suffering from it. And yet, I felt this calling inside of me, and I started to study it, because I knew the suffering my own Guilt created in my life. I had several talks about it, in front audiences of more than 100 people, and each time, I could see the light in their eyes, tears of relief running down their cheeks, people just having a weight removed from their shoulders. I then knew that: it is time I am bringing this knowledge to the masses, in a way of something safe for people (as nobody wants to share they are suffering from feeling guilty in their lives, or that something is broken). A book is safe, it is private and will allow the readers to have an awareness and making their feelings OK, so these do not need to impact their lives anymore. </p>
<p><b>To fund this project, I would need $6,000. </b></p>
<p><b>I would need a professional editor to work with m</b>e, mainly to help me with the structure and the implementation on my vision for this book. I am taking all I have learned in my own experience, with my clients and during the talks I shared, and from the 100+ interviews of some of the best Personal Development Experts in the world (including Marianne Williamson, Joe Vitale, Natalie Ledwell, Margaret Lynch and many others), but it needs structure and proper English, and these are the gifts of editors.<b> I would need a lovely cover</b>, and even if I could do this, I want somebody to use their skills and talents to make <b>the impression of relief and the reflection of the current pain they are suffering with</b>. And then, I would need a <b>worldwide distribution of the book,</b> and I have chosen Balboa Press, as they have the reach, the contacts, the professional services and the printing and distribution capabilities. </p>
<p>So, to get this book making the impact I would like to see and brining relief to the millions in the world, I would need the following (and these are the minimum, as I would welcome more funding to avail of higher levels of these services).</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$3,599 for the distribution and production services for Balboa Press (Inspire Package)</li>
<li>$1,000 for editorial work</li>
<li>$400 for art work</li>
<li>$600 for promotion and marketing (including a 2 weeks virtual book tour)</li>
<li>$400 for fees to support the campaign and all the transfer fees</li>
</ul>
<p>My time on this book, is the gift to humanity and my mission, and I believe that I  offer it, and be rewarded later by smiles, better lives for people, more hope, better children, and also financially, with services I will offer and royalties. </p>
<p>In the case I do not reach the full amount, the amount funded will go towards the distribution of the book, and I will find other ways to get what is missing. </p>
<p>In the case of that there is much more funding available to me, it will allow me to create bigger campaigns, to have a wider PR and media campaign and help more people, who are suffering, faster.</p>
<p><b>I value any contribution, from $10 to $1,000. </b></p>
<p>As a contributor, <b>you will get digital or physical copies of the book,</b> so that you can start to gain the awareness of why you may not allow yourself to feel happier, to have a better life, to finally be able to express more of you and get the relationship, the income and everything else you deserve. We all have dreams that seem not to come, we all have moments where we feel uneasy, hurt or misunderstood. This is the value of the book for you, to find the root causes and to decide to let them go. </p>
<p>There are many additional perks, and you will receive <b>multiple</b> copies of the book, so you can share them with people you love. You will also receive an <b>acknowledgement</b> in the book, and all future editions. <b>You will been seen by the many people who will benefit from these ideas, words and concepts, as one of the benefactor that enabled them to change their lives, gave them hope, made them better parents or simply allowed them to take the steps to bring their gifts to the world, and you will know that this is true too. You will have made a huge impact on the lives of thousands or millions of people in the world</b>. See the perks for more detail, but you could become their hero! </p>
<p>For the bigger supporters, I am offering something unique, which are to allow you to help others, and bring light and hope to them. This is powerful. I may also add some perks as we move long in the campaign.</p>
<p>If the milestone is reached, I would like to set new milestones, and I have amazing new perks ready for all of you: bracelets, live calls, exclusive workbook, and much more (I am still working on this).</p>
<p><b>So let's work together. I am bringing my energy, vision and wisdom and I would need the initial funding. And let's make it big, so we could share this on Oprah and be a catalyst of change for the world. </b></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The impact of this book is so great that I cannot even picture it. Imagine people finally accepting that they are feeling guilty, or even just acknowledging that there is some beliefs or some events that made them feel that they are wrong or bad, and that, after reading the pages of the book, they have the freedom and the choice to finally acknowledge this and let go of it. Imagine millions of people in the world releasing a little bit of their daily suffering because they carry this around.</p>
<p>This is the magic of this book. <b>This is what we can all do together, and you can really make a great difference to the world with me. </b></p>
<p><b>My main motivation is to help parents not carrying this guilt</b>, so that they can create a<b> better life for themselves</b> and also have a<b> better relationship, presence and ability to give love to their children</b>, instead of making these children feel guilty too. </p>
<p>With your help,<b> I can make this big, I will carry the message, and also make it known far and wide.</b> With you help, <b>I can make this project a reality</b>. With your help, <b>we can positively impact the future readers of this book</b>. </p>
<p>And you will get amazing perks too. First you will get the first edition of the book, signed copies, posters, copies to gift to people you, copies of my first best selling book ""Conversations for your Soul"", mentions in the book as heroes, gifts that you can give to others. </p>
<p>In addition of you using this material too, and being able to identify some of your own patterns and maybe hidden guilts, even before they get triggered. </p>
<p><b>But most of all, you will know you have made a significant impact in the world.</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>As for any of these projects, there are risks. </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>The main risk is the <b>poor distribution and not enough support to make it a reality</b>. I have written a best seller before and I have stepped up in my life and in the public place several times, but I know that, to create something of value and of impact, there needs to be a momentum, and this momentum needs to be created by several channels. The distribution, on a global scale, Global Press Releases and other campaigns are all necessary, and need to be managed and planned. <b>This is a risk I am looking to mitigate, by  using the lessons learned and the experience from my first book, and by engaging with the services of an experienced and well connected company.</b> This is also a risk that is mitigated by the choice of Balboa Press with their own services. </li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Another risk is the <b>lack of structure for the book</b>, which could lead to the content not be easily delivered, and will create a stop to its writing. This is a real rick, and, again, I speak from experience. There is so much emotions put in the book, so much personal stories, so much questions asked, that this could lead to a creative stop. In my first book, I surrounded myself with people who helped me keep the vision and the help of an editor, who gave me deadlines to pace my work and make me accountable. This is what I would do here too,<b> by teaming with one of the most amazing editor and writer in Ireland, I will have the pace and the inspiration to make it happen, and I will keep the inspiration and creative flow.</b> She will also help me with the overall structure and keep an eye on the bigger picture (when you write, you get silo'ed in at times). <br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>The positioning of the book</b> is the final major risk, and this is something I am working on for a few months now. <b>I am collaborating with agents, PR agencies, Personal Development Entrepreneurs, Business Groups in the world, and I am getting the support I need to make it a reality. </b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>I know that this is something we can all achieve together.<b> The collective energy we will create, will carry the project on a day by day basis. I have this passion inside of me to deliver this message, and free people</b> (simply because I know what it did to my life, and also I have seen and felt the <b>tears</b>, the <b>suffering</b> being melted, the <b>relief</b> on the face of thousands of people in my talks, and I want this for everyone who is ready to embrace life). </p>
<p>I am fortunate, because I am a 25-years project manager, and I have managed many projects, so this is something I am very good at. I also have the support and the help from a wider community, and this is wonderful for me to get this support and I have written, published and created a best-seller campaign in the past.<b> So I will make sure that this all these skills will be put in use in this project, and that you give towards helping mail lions of people in the world, will be well and efficiently used.</b> </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can help with some funding, it is great, and I am so thankful that you are ready to contribute to this adventure, more importantly help people, some very close to you, to finally find peace.</p>
<p><b>You can also share this campaign, let people know about it, on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIN, or share my videos of YouTube. Every time you share, you help me reaching more people, and this is the aim of this campaign, to get this book published, distributed and available at a global scale. </b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, if you give something, help making your contribution even more impactful, by sharing on social media. If you cannot give something, and if you like this work, make an extra effort on social media and other means of sharing this campaign.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary We saw how depression and other repressed emotions impact people in the world, and more recently with the suicide of one of the most respected artist on this planet. He seemed to have everything, as yet something was making him suffer deeply.  So why is this happening?
Guilt is the number one reason for people feeling stuck in their lives, for feeling stress and also creating years of unnecessary suffering. The main reasons for all of this internal suffering is feeling guilty about something of the past, or about something we believe is wrong. Some of the impacts are not that obvious, and I would like you to think about them: if you are feeling guilty of having more money than your parents, would you get more? If you are feeling guilty of being happy, while others are depressed, would you be OK being happy?
Most people never really thought about Guilt in this way, but I know, from my own experience, how one guilty feeling, repressed for years, completely unconscious, created more than 4.5 years of pain, suffering, nearly depression, no income, no job (despite an amazing CV), no relationship. How many other people are suffering from this? How many children are suffering because their parents are feeling this guilt? 
Being a single dad, I understand this, and I am, at times, feeling guilty for my daughter too, as for years, I could not offer her what she asked for, and I was so scared, that at times, I could not be present for her: so no treats and no presence... 
But, a little bit more about me, I am Bertrand Dory, and I am passionate about helping people getting a better life, and empowering them to express their full authentic presence and greatness. I am an international radio host, the best seller author of ""conversations for your soul"", the founder of several businesses, one being ""Design your Dream Life"". I am also an inspirational speaker, and a technologist and mathematician by education. ... and the dad of a wonderful girl, of 14 years of age. 



One day, I had this calling to explore Guilt as a feeling (more for getting myself unstuck in my own life) and to dig deeper. What I discovered was amazing: we are all suffering from it, because we are immersed in a society that creates guilt, and we all have said or done (or not said or done) things we regret. 


Our parents, friends, romantic partners, children, big corporations, governments, medias, religious figures, even employers are also using guilt to get what they want from us: love, acceptance, spending, compliance. And we are using these tools too, for acceptance and control mainly. 


We have our own personal guilts! And this feeling is something that we cannot really accept, as it is conscience-based, and feeling guilt about something we value wrong is also impacting how we value ourselves, and this creates a lot of issues of self-esteem, self-worth and confidence.

For the first time, in more than 40 years, he got to make this part of him and his experience OK for him, and this was like a ton of guilt, shame, pain, regrets lifted in a moment. 


And this is one of the key reasons I want to share this book and write it: a lot of people are suffering from it, and they do not know this or they carry so much burden or they do not want to feel this guilt. So, it gets repressed, it is untold, it is unshared, and one day, it is triggered, and when it is triggered, it creates huge suffering for the person, months of pains and struggle, and it impacts everybody around them. 


I have been in this situation. When I had a great life, you know what I mean: an amazing job, a great income, a wonderful romance, peace, a sense of belonging i life, contribution to others and pride for me, I would never have thought that I was carrying any form of guilt.

And this lasted for over 4 years of fears, struggles, unhappiness, no real relationship. I was lost, alone, filled with shame and guilt and struggling with my inner emotions every single day. 


This is what Guilt does to you: it sabotages your life, so that you are not faced with the idea that you are a bad person. The most extraordinary aspect is that it is not conscious, it is insidious, it is repressed, and we feel we cannot share what we feel with the world. And this is my mission in life to share this, create new perspectives for people, help them to free themselves and finally live a free-er, more empowered and wonderful life.

Risks & Challenges
 As for any of these projects, there are risks. 

The main risk is the poor distribution and not enough support to make it a reality.

We agreed to meet once a week for a full year, applying the framework we created, setting attainable goals and—bit by bit—regaining control over our lives. </p><p>At the end of that first year, we were amazed at the success of our new venture. So we decided to do it for another year. And another. And we got our friends to partner up and try CoJourn as well. Over time, the program grew to include participants from across the globe, all working to achieve their goals with the support their trusted friends, family, and peers.</p><p>6 years later, we are following through on another goal: publishing a book about CoJourn in our own words and the people whose lives it’s changed. With surprising insights, compelling research, and helpful tips, this book is a practical guide full of wisdom, compassion, and real-life stories from participants all over the world. It will inspire you to transform the trajectory of your life and make it your own again. </p><p><a href=""http://www.cojourn.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cojourn.org</a></p><p> </p><h2>What Will I Learn?</h2><p><strong>CoJourn includes: </strong></p><ul>

Over the course of a year, you work with someone you know and trust—whether this is a family member, a friend, or a colleague—to set goals and ensure that you follow through. CoJourn is simple, and accessible. All you need is someone you can talk to every week, to check in, set your next goals, and listen. </p><p> CoJourn was founded on the idea of mutual support. We all feel alone, especially when engrossed in a stressful project or life event. The point of CoJourn is to open up your isolation wide enough to allow one other person to help you. Your CoJourn partner is your confidant, your cheerleader, and the one making sure you strive towards your goals—even if you don’t manage to quite reach them. Compassion, forgiveness, and support are all tenets of the program. While the idea behind CoJourn is to be driven toward accountability through peer support and motivation, the method is compassionate and understanding, rather than punitive. </p><p>With its compassionate, partner-oriented framework, CoJourn differs from many other goal-centered motivational programs. Additionally, CoJourn is structured to enhance your life, rather than adding a new set of practices to incorporate into a daily or weekly routine. CoJourn is entirely malleable: you make it fit your interests and intentions. By setting weekly goals, you can choose to challenge yourself to try something new, or complete a project you’ve been meaning to get around to (but somehow keeps getting put off until tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow). </p><p> </p><h2>Why Do CoJourn?</h2><p>The key outcomes of CoJourn—closeness and follow-through— mirror what all of the recent research studies and books on happiness cite as two of the most important foundations for happiness and well-being:</p><ol>
<li>social bonds and connectivity</li>
<li>cultivating an “atmosphere of growth”—a sense of purpose and movement toward your goals.</li>
</ol><p>From our own personal experience, conversations with the hundreds of participants to date, and formal interviews with over fifty program participants, we can confidently say that CoJourn does increase connection and ensure a mechanism for weekly reflection on your values and visions for yourself. It transforms  the individualistic form of “self-help” into what we have termed “Together-Help,” which we find to be much more effective (and a heck of a lot more fun).</p><p> </p><h2>Advanced Praise for the Book (more coming!)</h2><p>“CoJourn is at once revolutionary and grounded in common sense and research. While technology and societal pressures may result in feelings of isolation, CoJourn provides a sensible  process for authentic human connection.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>S.P.A.C.E. to Learn is about the key skills our youth need to be successful in the new ways we will work in the fourth industrial revolution, given that the education system has not changed since the first industrial revolution.<br/><br/>My name is Zaimah Khan and I am the author of S.P.A.C.E. to Learn. I wrote this book because I am a parent and the way that we work has changed so much as we enter the fourth industrial revolution, yet our educational system has not changed since the industrialization revolution.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to help set up our youth for success. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for preparing our children for the new world of work. And ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you develop those skills in our youth.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about:<ul>
<li>Developing self-awareness in our youth and how it is <i><strong>THE</strong></i> foundational skill for the future of work.</li>
<li>Key skills that our children need to manage people and relationships as they grow up in a radically different world than our childhood.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in how to help our youth be prepared for adulthood and the new way of work. S.P.A.C.E. to Learn is a non-fiction book that speaks to parents and educators who are looking at the state of education and the fourth industrial revolution for the first time.</p>
<h3>The Book - S.P.A.C.E. to Learn</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and describes why we need to be thinking of changing educational paradigms and in the meantime how can we prepare the youth for the fourth industrial revolution.<br/><br/>In Part 2, I cover the key skills that today’s business leaders are missing in the workforce and how crucial these skills are for working in the fourth industrial revolution.<br/><br/>In Part 3, I continue my case for shifting paradigms and share some other skills that are important for our youth to learn and while important, they aren’t the essentials that are discussed in the previous chapters.</p>

</div></div>","Story of My BookS.P.A.C.E. to Learn is about the key skills our youth need to be successful in the new ways we will work in the fourth industrial revolution, given that the education system has not changed since the first industrial revolution.My name is Zaimah Khan and I am the author of S.P.A.C.E. to Learn. I wrote this book because I am a parent and the way that we work has changed so much as we enter the fourth industrial revolution, yet our educational system has not changed since the industrialization revolution.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to help set up our youth for success. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for preparing our children for the new world of work. And ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you develop those skills in our youth.In this book, you'll learn about:
Developing self-awareness in our youth and how it is THE foundational skill for the future of work.
Key skills that our children need to manage people and relationships as they grow up in a radically different world than our childhood.

You will love this book if you are interested in how to help our youth be prepared for adulthood and the new way of work. S.P.A.C.E. to Learn is a non-fiction book that speaks to parents and educators who are looking at the state of education and the fourth industrial revolution for the first time.
The Book - S.P.A.C.E. to Learn
The book is written in 3 Parts....Part 1 contains the introduction and describes why we need to be thinking of changing educational paradigms and in the meantime how can we prepare the youth for the fourth industrial revolution.In Part 2, I cover the key skills that today’s business leaders are missing in the workforce and how crucial these skills are for working in the fourth industrial revolution.In Part 3, I continue my case for shifting paradigms and share some other skills that are important for our youth to learn and while important, they aren’t the essentials that are discussed in the previous chapters.

What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p>«En la penumbra, jugó a afianzar sus pies descalzos únicamente sobre las zonas claras de los azulejos a cuadros. Con el cuerpo un poco oculto por el muro junto a la puerta, rodeó la perilla con sus dos manos y la giró gentil y lentamente. Empujó la madera hasta obtener un hueco inferior a un centímetro y pegó la cara a él para mirar.<br/>          Unas cuantas gotas de agua se estrellaron contra el marco de la ventana del pasillo. El olor y el fresco de la lluvia se colaron hasta Rocío. Julio dormía bocabajo con una sola pierna cubierta por las sábanas. A su lado, Inés se había sentado en la cama. Su cabello largo y oscuro resaltaba sobre el rosa pálido del  camisón que colgaba torcido de sus hombros. El gruñido se repitió y Rocío pudo percatarse de que provenía de la muchacha que se estremeció, llorando. <br/>          Rocío estaba preparada para descubrir a Inés o a su hermano sin poder contener un gemido de placer o bien jugando, imitando algún ruido para ilustrar una anécdota, pero no para verla a ella sacudida por sollozos reprimidos mientras Julio roncaba indiferente, a escasos centímetros. Una extraña sensación de vacío se instaló en su estómago. Sintió la impotencia creciendo en el centro de su cuerpo. ¿Qué le pasa? Mentalmente repasó las acciones de la muchacha durante los últimos días. Ninguna pista.<br/>          Decidió arriesgar otro poco y empujó la puerta un centímetro más para escudriñar la habitación en busca de algún dato revelador. Había libros sobre la mesita de noche, un cenicero sucio, latas de refresco, ropa amontonada en un rincón.<br/>          Su marranero habitual, pensó.<br/>          Con extremo cuidado para no hacer ruido, comenzó a cerrar la puerta. Una corriente helada le recorrió la espalda. Dio un paso hacia atrás. Se incorporó. Le pareció que el aire detrás de ella se volvía pesado. Algo ofrecía resistencia a su avance. Trató de respirar hondo, pero sintió el pecho fuertemente oprimido. Giró la cabeza. El frío se intensificó. Al volverse un poco, Rocío vio a una mujer de pelo largo y suelto, vestida de oscuro; pero cubierta con un chal claro, que espiaba también a los novios, asomada sobre su hombro derecho. El pelo de su nuca se erizó y un terror indescriptible se instaló en su pecho, dificultando su respiración.<br/>          Como entre sueños, percibió de nuevo el olor a lluvia. Brincó hacia un lado para alejarse de la mujer. El pasillo se alargó frente a sus ojos y sintió que  la oscuridad crecía desde el extremo de su mirada hacia el centro.<br/>          La mujer se movió para cruzar la punta de su chal blanco hacia atrás. Se escuchó un crujido seco, como de agua abriéndose paso a  través de un suelo terregoso.<br/>          De nuevo el frío corrió por el cuerpo de la muchacha y sintiendo una angustia gemela a la de su reciente pesadilla, comenzó a temblar. Pensó que iba a desmayarse. El espectro se alejó un paso de la puerta y sonrió arrugando las sienes.<br/>          —¡Julio! —intentó gritar Rocío, pero la voz se quedó aferrada a su garganta.<br/>          —¡Julio! —pareció arremedarla en voz alta el espectro, antes de esfumarse.<br/>          La puerta del cuarto del muchacho se abrió por completo, como empujada por una ráfaga, exponiendo la presencia de Rocío en el pasillo, al mismo tiempo que ella logró soltar un chillido agudo y moverse de nuevo».</p>

<h3></h3>We need to raise £4000 to fund our
livestream coverage of events in the run up to the General Election in May. We
all remember the bias of mainstream media during the referendum and the
misinformation broadcast to millions of Scots, and there’s no sign that things
will be different during this election campaign - that has to change. We need
to ensure that broad, fair and honest coverage of election debates and hustings
are shared across the country, to give voters the best possible information
about candidates so they can make decisions about who to send to Westminster.<br/><br/><p>We also need to grow our network of
citizen livestreamers and contacts, much of which has been funded to date through
previous crowdfund appeals and the Independence Live team. </p>
<p>Please support our crowdfunding
campaign, we believe livestreaming and coverage across the country is essential
to counteract traditional media coverage.</p>
<p>You can see how widespread our videos
became during the referendum campaign. This video of Ivan McKee of Business for

livestream coverage of events in the run up to the General Election in May. We
all remember the bias of mainstream media during the referendum and the
misinformation broadcast to millions of Scots, and there’s no sign that things
will be different during this election campaign - that has to change. We need
to ensure that broad, fair and honest coverage of election debates and hustings
are shared across the country, to give voters the best possible information
about candidates so they can make decisions about who to send to Westminster.We also need to grow our network of
citizen livestreamers and contacts, much of which has been funded to date through
previous crowdfund appeals and the Independence Live team. 
Please support our crowdfunding
campaign, we believe livestreaming and coverage across the country is essential
to counteract traditional media coverage.
You can see how widespread our videos
became during the referendum campaign. This video of Ivan McKee of Business for
Scotland received more than 100k views – we need to do more like this, and with
your donations, we can.

Why support the project?

I've labored on this project for the last 2 ½ years, spending a
lot of time, effort and money travelling hundreds of kilometers/miles to all the locations involved, talking
to people and doing research. So why is this book important
and why should you contribute to make it happen? Here are a few points to
consider:


It will be the first photographic inventory/catalog  of sundials in Transylvania (and all of Romania, for that matter). 


It will provide a
     reference work for people interested in studying the history / design / construction / restoration of sundials. This means it addresses several categories
     of readers: tourists,
     architects, historians, professional
     and amateur astronomers,

It will contribute to the education
     of people regarding the history and functionality of sundials 

It will increase public awareness and
     hopefully translate into some form of protective legislation for these

It will promote a new local sundial trend in urban decorating and housing design 

It will promote communities in which
     sundials are to be found and
     increase local tourism by stimulating the creation and
     development of alternative tourist
     routes (sundial trails).

It will act as a focal point for bringing together the three main cultures and peoples which have shared this region for a long time: Romanians, Hungarians and Saxons. 




What is the current project status?

The Romanian manuscript is
ready for printing. English, German and Hungarian abstracts are underway.

What happens if the

If my funding goal is met all the money goes into printing the book in 1000 copies using

<p><span>My hope is that you will be able to feel the passion pouring out of me onto this page in this brief summary of my project. I have tried, to the best of my ability, to give my life over to this cause that God has placed on my heart. It has challenged me on so many levels and all in all has made me become a better friend, a better brother, a better man, and ultimately a better expression of humanity through God’s love.</span></p>
<p>Many of you who will be viewing this page have shared in these experiences with me and have witnessed the changes that have occurred in my life and in my relationship with the world. It has been such a blessing to watch God work as I’ve stepped aside and just let the process take place. I have been bound and determined to create a piece of writing that expressed to the world, what God was expressing to me. I believe I have accomplished that task with <i>Wrapped In Skin</i>, the first of several looks inside of my communication with God as He shares with me His wisdom, so that I might share it with others.</p>
<p>The awesome news is that the project is finished. The work, however, has only just begun. As I’ve tried to figure out ways to get people involved in this project, several people whom I trust and believe in, mentioned the idea of crowdfunding for the book launch (which will include final logo designs, marketing, website, advertising, etc. All of the things needed to officially launch the book). My first thought was, “There is no way I’m asking for money to help with this book”. Then I thought of all of the people who I’d hoped would pick this book up and have their perspectives on life and purpose changed forever. Secondly, I thought of all of the encouragement and support I have gotten along the way from people who have an interest and belief in this project. Finally, I realized that the idea of crowdfunding was not about the money! It was about allowing people who care about this project, care about humanity, and care about well-being as a whole, to be a part of something larger than all of us.</p>
<p>I hope that you will watch my video, if you haven’t already, and share it with others. It has been an unbelievable journey thus far and God has much more work for me to do. I also hope that you will join me in making <i>Wrapped in Skin</i> as impactful as possible.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>

Then I thought of all of the people who I’d hoped would pick this book up and have their perspectives on life and purpose changed forever. Secondly, I thought of all of the encouragement and support I have gotten along the way from people who have an interest and belief in this project. Finally, I realized that the idea of crowdfunding was not about the money! It was about allowing people who care about this project, care about humanity, and care about well-being as a whole, to be a part of something larger than all of us.
I hope that you will watch my video, if you haven’t already, and share it with others. It has been an unbelievable journey thus far and God has much more work for me to do. I also hope that you will join me in making Wrapped in Skin as impactful as possible.   What We Need & What You Get
