</div><p></p><p>Oktosol is an
entirely new and innovative solar energy collection system from Styria, Austria.
It is the first solar energy collection system that can both protect and clean
itself. Due to this unique aspect, it can be used in all sunny regions of the
world, even in desert areas with sandstorms.</p>
<p>With a mirror
surface area of 30m², Oktosol produces 25KWp of heat energy. In its standard
version, Oktosol is designed to operate at a temperature of up to 200°C and at
a system pressure of 25bar.</p>
<h4><b>What makes Oktosol unique?</b></h4>
<p>While in a
closed position, the surface area of Oktosol that is exposed to wind is cut in
half. The solar collectors on the side of the mirrors hold each other and are
therefore very stable. In its standard version, Oktosol can easily withstand a
maximum wind speed of 150 km/h. The safety factor built into Oktosol’s design
is 2, meaning that Oktosol can very likely withstand even dynamic pressure and
higher wind speeds. </p>
<p>Due to Oktosol’s
unique concentrator and vacuum technologies, high operating temperatures do not
result in a loss of efficiency, meaning the area of application is increased
immensely. The high temperature heat can also be converted into electricity
over evaporation processes. </p>
<p>Oktosol’s
ability to both protect and clean itself result in greater durability and
longevity over standard solar energy collection systems. Additionally Oktosol
utilizes a biaxial tracking system, which will raise energy output by 50%
resulting in a higher daily output. Due to these aspects, an increased
cost-benefit ratio over existing systems will be realized by the customer.
Large facilities can be economically operated due to the automated cleaning
system, which will always provide 100% clean mirrors with little or no
associated labor costs. </p><p></p><h4><b>State of Development</b></h4>
<p>Currently, the first prototype has been built and
tested, confirming successful operation and a power output of 25 KWp. </p>
<p>A second prototype has been completely designed and
simply needs budget for construction and additional testing. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437476390/f8hydyv2nutlw9rdl2ne.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p></p><h4><b>Usage of the Crowd Funds</b></h4>

<p><b>What is Oktosol?</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Oktosol is a biaxial, sun tracking solar energy
collection system with eight mirror-concentrators. Due to its tracking system,
automatic protection system, and cleaning system, it can even be used in
regions with extreme environmental conditions that ordinary solar energy
systems cannot, such as steppes and san deserts. </p>
<p><b>How much room does Oktosol
need?</b></p>
<p>Oktosol is 5 meters tall and rotates in a radius of 5
meters.  It can be installed in an area
that is only 2 square meters. </p>
<p>For a large collection field of multiple units, an
area of 250m² per collector unit is needed for calculating in order to avoid

<p>The heat can be used for indoor climate control (both
heating and cooling), water heating, and cooking. Converting high temperature
heat into electricity through evaporation is a possibility as well. Heat
extraction at 75 to 100°C will allow for a two stage usage: high temperature
for electricity production and the lesser heat “waste” for heating. Also,

application.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437476041/omh1yl62ab33a6gew1qd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><b></b></p><b>
</b><p><b>Is
Oktosol also suited for pure electricity production?</b></p>
<p>It would be feasible to connect a steam-powered device
that could turn imported heat into electricity. It would product a minimum of
100kWp-terminal (=4 Oktosol). The system therefore has to release the heat of
the condensation to the surrounding area. According to the temperature of the
heated release (45-75°C), an electric performance of a 100 kWp-TH construction
of 16 kWp-EL (at 75°C condensation) to 20 kWp-EL (at 45°C condensation) is
approachable. </p>
<p><b>Are

<p>The product is already in advanced stages of design

Alternate
Energy Sources - Electric Power and Yerba Mate. 
Copas, Inc. plans to offer organic Yerba Mate in the U.S. through retail storefronts called Copas Yerba Mate Cafes. We are starting out with a Copas Switch Kart. A
way to “Think Globally Act Locally” 

The Copas Switch Kart is to be used to serve Yerba Mate to people wherever we can find them. We are starting out in Sonoma County, CA (North Bay) and will move additional Karts to the other Bay Area Counties. Our first one is targeted for our locals in the North Bay and we will be based out of Petaluma, CA. This relocatable kart helps show an alternative form of energy used to transport and an alternative form of energy for ones self. Yerba Mate is a common stimulant beverage, which is consumed on a daily basis in South America, is a unique tea whose taste and benefits are just becoming known in North America and Europe. According to some, it can offer the health benefits of green tea, the energy boost of coffee, without the jitters and crash, and even the euphoria of dark chocolate. Yerba Mate is rich in anti-oxidants, amino acids, minerals and vitamins. 

Copas (Portuguese for cup), Inc. plans to offer organic, fair traded, sustainable products, including organic Yerba Mate, organic locally grown food, and organic beverages, including organic beer and wine named Copas Yerba Mate Cafe. Help us get started with these cool Karts. One could be in your neighborhood soon.

   What We Need  

We need to raise $10,000.00 more to finish building the Copas Switch Kart. 
The costs for building one of these karts is $20,000.00. 

We have already received half of the money, which paid the down-payment on the Kart and they have already started building it. PLEASE help us raise the rest. We are starting  with this ALL ELECTRIC  relocate-able cart to show an alternate use of electric power for travel and an alternative energy source for oneself. Copas Switch Karts are used to lower the carbon foot print, offer an alternative source for energy, add sales dollars, awareness, marketing and used for testing possible store front locations.

Ltd. (Plant facilities shown above). We worked together for two years experimenting with different fiber fabric cloths and natural inks. The company saw the commercial value in this venture and, with both a considerable cost and time investment, we developed a process to meet with the high standards of Kakemono scrolling art. I have an exclusive contract for this proprietary product.</p><p>Established in 2012, Zhangjiagang City Printing Advertising Co., Ltd., is the largest digital printing factory in Zhangjiagang, Suzhou province. It specializes in banners, stickers, display products, flag manufacturing, digital printing service, UV flatbed printing, display product and other relevant advertising products.</p><p>In order to sell manufactured products on the Etsy sales venue, you must have the Etsy Manufacturers Approval designation. This coveted certification requires strict adherence to environmental, health, employee and ISO regulations. I’m proud to say that I was instrumental in their receiving the first Chinese company certification in the printing category.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>Any entrepreneurial pursuit is fraught with unexpected developments. I’ve learned that hard work and perseverance can get you through most anything. This project has been in development for more than ten years counting the process of hand-sculpting stone Buddhas and is now starting to come to fruition with daily sales.</p><p>I’ve learned many new skills since the start of this project. Photoshopping my works in a home décor environment was a major breakthrough. With 80-plus products and each necessitating up to 10 different in-situ photographs on four separate sales venue sites, I had to take hundreds of photographs. These were also used as my daily content posts on the social media sites.</p><p>The photoshopping type of daily content posts has become less effective.

All are prints from my original iconic Buddha stone sculptures. Images of the meditating Buddha have become a universally recognized icon for meditation, serenity and spirituality. The Colorful series of 36 Kakemono style prints of my sculptures are unique and unlike anything else available. Our beautiful Kakemono scrolling posters are now available in two sizes: large (23” x 44”) and small (8” x 16”).Photos of my original hand-sculpted-in-stone Buddhas are offered in the ancient Kakemono scrolling art style. Our 18 Antique style Kakemono scrolling posters are all characterized by the cracking, fading and weathered look of ancient oil paintings. The sepia-colored patina adds to this effect.Our five Chinese Calligraphy Kakemono scrolling posters are artful treasures and perfect for your home, office or that secluded space you retreat to after a difficult day. Give the gift of peace and serenity to that special and spiritual someone that is difficult to buy for. The mini-sized (8"" x 16"") Kakemono posters fit those small spaces like alcoves or next to doors and windows. They can be grouped in multiples in both horizontal and vertical spaces. The two-piece hardwood top and bottom dowels can be easily removed to allow for staining, painting or fabric coverings to match your personal décor. Blue painted dowels on this one. Kakemono scrolling posters capture the spiritual and mystical characteristics of the Asian culture. Your poster will arrive with finely finished natural grain hardwood dowels. Beautiful as is. Brass eye screws are included for hanging. Keeping focused in a peaceful and meditative state is enhanced by the simple Buddha image. Chinese Calligraphy in a single oriental character can portray the essence of a sentence. Create a space that is conducive to your peace of mind. These dowels are stained with a dark wood color.  What We Need & What You GetOur Flexible goal of $8,000 will be the minimum needed to expand our current operation by purchasing inventory to stock two new fulfillment centers.Interest and sales continue to grow in spite of high shipping costs to Europe and Canada ($40+ for a $30 Kakemono poster). By using the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) in Europe and Canada for warehousing and delivery, our shipping costs are greatly reduced. We will use the same sales techniques for these new stores that we are now using in our successful USA Amazon store.$14,000 in contributions would allow us to purchase our inventory at highly discounted prices, increasing profits substantially. $20,000 is our real goal as it would  provide for the development of our Shopify, eBay and Etsy  stores. Sales have been made on all three, but some professional marketing, promotional and developmental assistance is needed.All of our USA stores (Amazon, Shopify, eBay and Etsy) now use Prime Logistics, located in Florence, Kentucky, for warehousing and delivery. We will continue with this for all four stores for USA customers.A very unique perk is an anthropological tour. My background and extensive knowledge of Southeast Asia and its ancient Khmer  historical sanctuaries will allow you the private tour of a lifetime. From the time you arrive until your departure you will be in my capable hands. Special Early Bird OfferLIMITED BEST-FRIEND LEVELEach $1200 contributor will be rewarded with a one-week, Thailand anthropological tour. A selection of ancient Khmer stone masterpiece sites can include UNESCO World Heritage sites and other less known examples. Includes 3-4 star hotels, meals, local transportation, fees and my expert personal guide service.The first ten $1,200 contributors will receive an extra (3) days at the beach on the tropical island of Koh Chang, Thailand.Itineraries are scheduled according to your and my availability. If you have a special request for additional sites that you would like to visit, please inform me and I'll do my best to schedule it into your personal itinerary. Spouses or a friend you wish to accompany you will be charged an additional $1,200. Holiday tours must be scheduled between estimated close of campaign in June 2017 and June 2018.

http://www.emeraldtriangletours.comhttps://www.khmer-road-sculpture.com  ImpactI was fortunate to enter into a product development project with the Zhangjiagang Printing and Advertising Co. Ltd. (Plant facilities shown above). We worked together for two years experimenting with different fiber fabric cloths and natural inks. The company saw the commercial value in this venture and, with both a considerable cost and time investment, we developed a process to meet with the high standards of Kakemono scrolling art. I have an exclusive contract for this proprietary product.Established in 2012, Zhangjiagang City Printing Advertising Co., Ltd., is the largest digital printing factory in Zhangjiagang, Suzhou province. It specializes in banners, stickers, display products, flag manufacturing, digital printing service, UV flatbed printing, display product and other relevant advertising products.In order to sell manufactured products on the Etsy sales venue, you must have the Etsy Manufacturers Approval designation. This coveted certification requires strict adherence to environmental, health, employee and ISO regulations. I’m proud to say that I was instrumental in their receiving the first Chinese company certification in the printing category. Risks & ChallengesAny entrepreneurial pursuit is fraught with unexpected developments. I’ve learned that hard work and perseverance can get you through most anything. This project has been in development for more than ten years counting the process of hand-sculpting stone Buddhas and is now starting to come to fruition with daily sales.I’ve learned many new skills since the start of this project. Photoshopping my works in a home décor environment was a major breakthrough. With 80-plus products and each necessitating up to 10 different in-situ photographs on four separate sales venue sites, I had to take hundreds of photographs. These were also used as my daily content posts on the social media sites.The photoshopping type of daily content posts has become less effective.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>We are living in an indoor society that is much different from the world we lived in hundreds of years ago where we would spend much more of our time outside. Even our children are spending way more time inside than outside. We are working inside for 20 to 40 hours a week and after a day of work, we again spend our time inside. Many people only see the sky when they walk from their houses to their cars.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>Most people have a structural shortage of daylight, sunlight and vitamin D. This causes all kinds of health problems that can result into serious illnesses. Many people are having trouble sleeping, are anxious and stressed in this high demanding and fast-paced world.</p>

Risks & Challenges
Manufacturing a physical product can be a tough journey. One of the most important factors is the relationship with the supplier. Luckily, we have a trusting relationship with a high-quality manufacturer founded on transparency and open communication. Even with working prototypes in our hands that have passed quality inspections and contracts in place with our manufacturer ready to go, there is always a possibility of something going unplanned. Because of this, we have added buffers in our timeline to embrace the unexpected and allow us to deliver your product on time.Our goal is to deliver a high quality product on the market, and we will work non-stop to deliver the product on time and be transparent from start to finish.",42.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hello. This is Boxscoop.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The litter box is a real struggle, for <strong>all of us</strong>. This system will change that but before we explain the intricacies, we would like to tell you <strong>how it came to be</strong>. From a young age I have been passionate on design, efficiency and simplicity. When I grew up I became an Engineer. Michelle and I are both passionate on fairness and respect for all creatures. The disconnect between integrating the litter box into the household and having it ethical for our cats drove us crazy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the start of 2017 through to Oct. 2018 we stood by helplessly watching my sister face an aggressive breast cancer; I coped by spending copious amounts of time fixated on designing a better litter box. We approached it from a completely different angle demanding the utmost efficiency with zero compromise. The vision was to create the perfect synergy between human <strong>AND</strong> cat needs.</p>
<p>James + Michelle</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>First, we need to meow this out.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Boxscoop has modern aesthetics and because your eyes cannot catch the corners (there are none) it appears smaller than it is. It's an illusion... it's not meant for 25 lb cats but it is bigger than a standard litter box and far more ergonomic to the way cats move. </p>

<h3>Minimalist design</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When dealing with pee and poo, the fewer components and seams the better. The container, scoop and cover are all <strong>precision made</strong>. Ridges and contours are elegantly carved into the surface to allow it to slice through the litter like this. The design looks simple because we <strong>over-engineered for simplicity</strong>. Creating this sized container with precision in one piece requires a machine capable of pressing the equivalent weight of 330 cars!</p>
<p><br/>The cover on 2.0 is designed to <strong>securely fit</strong> <strong>without any clips</strong>, because who wants to fumble with clips every time they go to clean the litter box! It's actually so secure it's essentially dog proof!</p>

<p>5 days and <strong>2.7 minutes total</strong> spent on the litter box, including removing/replacing the cover and tossing the waste in another room— and that's daily cleaning with a 14-15lb cat. This is real life with Boxscoop.</p>

Hello. This is Boxscoop.
 
The litter box is a real struggle, for all of us. This system will change that but before we explain the intricacies, we would like to tell you how it came to be. From a young age I have been passionate on design, efficiency and simplicity. When I grew up I became an Engineer. Michelle and I are both passionate on fairness and respect for all creatures. The disconnect between integrating the litter box into the household and having it ethical for our cats drove us crazy.
 
From the start of 2017 through to Oct. 2018 we stood by helplessly watching my sister face an aggressive breast cancer; I coped by spending copious amounts of time fixated on designing a better litter box. We approached it from a completely different angle demanding the utmost efficiency with zero compromise. The vision was to create the perfect synergy between human AND cat needs.
James + Michelle
 
First, we need to meow this out.
 
Boxscoop has modern aesthetics and because your eyes cannot catch the corners (there are none) it appears smaller than it is. It's an illusion... it's not meant for 25 lb cats but it is bigger than a standard litter box and far more ergonomic to the way cats move. 
 

 
 
A Zero Compromise Solution.


 
Boxscoop is chore free to maintain, raises next to zero dust, and is designed from cat behavior studies for cat comfort... plus, it's modern and looks nothing like a litter box.
 

 
We released our first model in July 2018 and the feedback was incredible. We recorded every detail and consistently analyzed for improvements. Success to us is making the most number of lives better. We brought the first model to market ourselves; we can do infinitely better together with you.
 

 
 

 
We've now shipped 6000+ Boxscoops!


 

 
Minimalist design
 
When dealing with pee and poo, the fewer components and seams the better. The container, scoop and cover are all precision made. Ridges and contours are elegantly carved into the surface to allow it to slice through the litter like this. The design looks simple because we over-engineered for simplicity. Creating this sized container with precision in one piece requires a machine capable of pressing the equivalent weight of 330 cars!
The cover on 2.0 is designed to securely fit without any clips, because who wants to fumble with clips every time they go to clean the litter box! It's actually so secure it's essentially dog proof!
 

 

 
5 days and 2.7 minutes total spent on the litter box, including removing/replacing the cover and tossing the waste in another room— and that's daily cleaning with a 14-15lb cat. This is real life with Boxscoop.
 

 

 
A standard clay litter in a standard litter box with one large cat costs ~US$ 220 per year. Boxscoop is extremely litter efficient and saves hundreds in litter costs:

*Annual costs calculated are approximations based on one large cat (12-15lbs). For full experiment and results, please see our blog post: The cost of cat litter
 


 
From surveys, 52% of our backers use clay litter and Boxscoop is ~35% more litter efficient than a standard litter box with clay litter. From the 6000 we've shipped in 2019, that translates to at least 500,000lbs less clay litter being consumed per year. That's a big deal, and with every new Boxscoop 2.0 shipped, the number will keep increasing.
 

 
We engineered features into the design to perform even better with alternative clumping litters like corn, grass, walnut, wheat and more. These litters are lighter, healthier for cats, biodegradable and they stay fresher longer, saving you money while saving the environment and your cats health.
This is Boxscoop with a Walnut based litter:
 

 

 
Grass litter compliments almost all other clumping litters, especially clay. It's typically odor and dust free and it clumps and absorbs odors and moisture amazingly well.
If you have a clay litter you love, mixing 30-50% of a grass litter in with the clay will keep the litter fresher and extend its life. It also lightens heavy clays and makes them even easier to scoop!
 
*Dr. Elsey Ultra and other similar coarse grain clay litters are sludgy and require more scooping force in Boxscoop. If you'd like to use a coarse grain clay, we highly recommend mixing in 30-50% of a grass or walnut litter.
 
This is Dr.Elsey's Ultra with 50% Grass litter added:
 

 
 
Boxscoop components are 100% recyclable— and we package without the use of plastic.
We're also currently developing a toss container that will seamless attach to Boxscoop so you can scoop, toss and compostable bag quickly! The toss container holds and dispenses rolls of compostable doggie waste bags.
This accessory will be available for your Boxscoop in April 2020, and as a Boxscoop backer you can pre-order it directly from our site at 67% discount.
 
 

 
 



 
 

 
Cats have 200 million odor-sensitive cells and it’s our mission to make daily cleaning easy, so your cats have one of their most basic and overlooked needs fulfilled—a clean comfortable place to do their business.

*Photos from our original model. Boxscoop 2.0 is even more open on top.
 

 
80% of cats take to Boxscoop like ""ducks to water"" the other 20% require more time. The design works both with and without the cover; this way the skeptic cats can adjust at their own pace. 
Purrwood forest uses them both ways throughout their no kill sanctuary. 
 

 
 

 
 
It's time to say goodbye smelliness...
 
The beauty of having no corners or seams makes sanitizing the whole litter box so easy and rewarding.
   
For an extra deep clean you can let the scoop and container sit in a vinegar/water solution.

Like all ventures in life, mine started with an idea.  Inspired by the limited space in my beautiful 2 year old daughter's bedroom, I started looking for space saving furniture with superior build quality, at a good price. What I found was disappointing at first, but then I realized that there is a huge market for this in South Africa.  The loft beds that we can get, is either badly build, or overpriced.  Well build beds start from $1100 up to a staggering $2000. </div><div>After a considerable amount of research, I found that I can produce an excellent product, and show a profit for only $900</div><div>With very strong wood, and strategically placed fasteners, the product can comfortably carry 160Kg or 350lb, which comes in handy when Mommy needs to share the bed to get the little one to fall asleep. </div><div>After 4 Months of juggling a day job, household, kids, a husband, and designing of the product part-time, I'm finally ready to launch my first product at my new startup, <b>DinkySpaces</b>. 
</div><div>From the get-go, I aimed to have my first product ready for production by October'15, and I am almost there.  I have taken the plunge and booked a stand for the last week in August to promote the product at a local well-known Expo in South Africa. </div><div>This is where I ask you for a little support.  As with any start-up business, some funding is required to get everything up and running.  Please would you be so kind as to back me in this venture?  </div><div>The Money would be located as follows:</div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">1st Product Build $800</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Packaging Design $200</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Overheads $600</span><br/>

</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Product Marketing expenses $1200</span><br/>

Our Story


Like all ventures in life, mine started with an idea.  Inspired by the limited space in my beautiful 2 year old daughter's bedroom, I started looking for space saving furniture with superior build quality, at a good price. What I found was disappointing at first, but then I realized that there is a huge market for this in South Africa.  The loft beds that we can get, is either badly build, or overpriced.  Well build beds start from $1100 up to a staggering $2000. After a considerable amount of research, I found that I can produce an excellent product, and show a profit for only $900With very strong wood, and strategically placed fasteners, the product can comfortably carry 160Kg or 350lb, which comes in handy when Mommy needs to share the bed to get the little one to fall asleep. After 4 Months of juggling a day job, household, kids, a husband, and designing of the product part-time, I'm finally ready to launch my first product at my new startup, DinkySpaces. 
From the get-go, I aimed to have my first product ready for production by October'15, and I am almost there.  I have taken the plunge and booked a stand for the last week in August to promote the product at a local well-known Expo in South Africa. This is where I ask you for a little support.  As with any start-up business, some funding is required to get everything up and running.  Please would you be so kind as to back me in this venture?  The Money would be located as follows:

1st Product Build $800


Packaging Design $200


Overheads $600

Expenditures $300

Transport Hire(Logistics) $100


Product Marketing expenses $1200

Anything above and beyond will go towards setting up an in-house production facility.  With a couple of years working in a production environment, and experience in business management, I believe I can grow a successful business.",2.0,1,"2 Campaigns

My wife's name is Jane and we've worked with orphans for over five years now.  Providing for them is something we are deeply passionate about. We currently feed 50 orphans on the island and want to build housing for them. <br/></p>
<p> I was a teacher for sometime, where I learned the importance of a stable home life, and its impact on educational development. That is the reason we decided to start the orphanage. Lots of the kids we care for either didn't have parents or had abusive ones affected by alcoholism or HIV/AIDS. Currently they are staying with different volunteers in temporary housing, and while that is better than what they had before, they still are in a very difficult situation, having nowhere to call home. </p>
<p>On the positive side small donations can go a long way in helping the orphans have a place to call home. Since Kenya is a poor country we can do a lot with a little. Please read more about what we are doing and consider donating today. <br/></p>

<br/>**These prices don't include the second dormitory we plan on building, chairs, tables or shelves for the orphans to put their things. We can manage without these things for a time, and simply want a roof for the kids<b>**</b><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>For five years know we've been feeding and providing clothes for these orphans. We started with 300,000 Kenya shillings ($3,750 dollars) a year and now in year five we've been able to grow that number to 2,000,000 shillings ($25,000 dollars) demonstrating that we can successfully use the money we receive and provide even more. Although, we've been able to grow the money supply we've also had a large influx of orphans as well, due to HIV and can only afford to feed and cloth them right now. With your help they will finally have a permanent place to sleep. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>This project isn't going to be easy. I am currently renting out my own home to get additional funds to help build the project and to allow me to manage it. <br/><br/>Some of the challenges we could face are:<br/>1. Not getting enough to start the building, in which case we will save the money for a year and if after that time we haven't raised enough we will use it for food for the children. <br/>2. Getting approval from local government and tribe leaders.<br/>3. Change in prices of building materials. <br/><br/>We expect to be able to overcome any challenges that may arise due to our great network of volunteers around the world. Currently we have a professional engineer, IT workers, a community worker, a doctor, and other professionals who are willing to spend their own money to come out for the construction of the project because they believe in the cause, and will be of great help to us when facing any challenges.  <br/><br/>Also, I've been living on the island my whole life and have a good relationship with the community and have participated in building the local school so I know about how the process will go.

<h3><strong>Moonwort Studio - Our Work</strong></h3>
<p>Our creative work seeks new ways for people to experience and learn about nature, especially our wonderfully diverse native plants. Among Moonwort Studio projects that bring the beauty of native plants into view are planted terrariums, courtyard gardens and related kinds of model ecosystem displays.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480909028/avu8o8av4l69jiqxbjoe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our design work is informed by visits to natural ecosystems. Providing opportunity for close study of wild plants, animals and places, these trips offer creative inspiration and natural history content for our projects. As enjoyable as it is to visit our neighboring forests, prairies and wetlands, we have been dismayed to find some areas badly degraded by established invasive weeds, such as common buckthorn, or quickly succumbing to invasive newcomers, such as garlic mustard. The spread of non-native, invasive weeds has profound, reverberating effects. As native plants under pressure from invasives fail to reproduce and fade away, the food and shelter they provide for wild animals also disappear from the landscape.</p>
<h3><strong>Cricket Precision Weeding Tool </strong></h3>
<p>Hand-pulling is a favorite method for removing invasive plants, but it can actually encourage their spread. With each invasive plant that is pulled out by the roots, a patch of soil is disturbed and exposed. Invasive plant seeds buried in the soil are also brought to the surface where they can germinate with exposure to light. Other weeding methods can discourage desirable native plants (mowing) or pollute the environment (herbicides).</p>
<p>The Cricket Precision Weeding Tool addresses these issues with a sharp cutting edge that slices through the invasive plant crown and causes minimal soil disturbance. The Cricket steel blade (see design below) is attached to a lightweight hardwood handle with a long reach, so you can cut many invasive weeds with relatively easy work. While chopping the top of a plant might kill it right away, timely weeding with the Cricket will slow the spread of invasive plants so that native species can gain an advantage with growth, reproduction and establishment. </p>

<h3><strong>Crowdfunding the Cricket </strong></h3>
<p>Your support will bring the Cricket Precision Weeding Tool project to scale with the steps in our first production run.</p>
<p>A local metalwork shop will use a CNC laser to cut the Cricket blades from high-carbon steel, while we will use a bench grinder to shape the cutting edges.  So that the blades will hold a sharp cutting edges during use, we will heat treat (+1,100°F) the steel blanks for hardness, then heat temper (400°F) for toughness. We will also apply safety red paint to high-quality hardwood tool handles. We will seat the Cricket blades in the handles, then seal the handle ferrule end with epoxy.

Just plug Netool into a port and gain access to information that you have never had access to before.<br/><br/>Reduce labor by cutting out the amount of time it takes to trouble-shoot a misconfigured port and having the power to send and access info with a network engineer who does not need to physically be in the area.<br/><br/>Netool is designed to be simple to use and understand. It enables anyone to find network port information they would not have had before such as DHCP, switch port, switch host name, current VLAN, tagged VLANs and more. Netool also runs ping and other tests on the same port making trouble shooting easier.<br/><br/>Because Netool is software based, Netool's features list will keep growing,  giving you an endless number of options to troubleshoot and discover network based systems.<br/><br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456195063/b4yfpe8ohaz1ji33hhio.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Meet Netool
     
The network diagnostic and discovery tool you have been waiting forNetool is a diagnostic tool for testing and discovering information about any given network port on any switch, router or any other network device. Just plug Netool into a port and gain access to information that you have never had access to before.Reduce labor by cutting out the amount of time it takes to trouble-shoot a misconfigured port and having the power to send and access info with a network engineer who does not need to physically be in the area.Netool is designed to be simple to use and understand. It enables anyone to find network port information they would not have had before such as DHCP, switch port, switch host name, current VLAN, tagged VLANs and more. Netool also runs ping and other tests on the same port making trouble shooting easier.Because Netool is software based, Netool's features list will keep growing,  giving you an endless number of options to troubleshoot and discover network based systems. 
  

 

 What Netool can discover 


DHCP
LLDP/CDP information
Switch port / switch stack / switch management ip
Untagged VLAN ID
Tagged VLAN IDs
Duplicate IP address
Gateway ping test
Internet ping test
Custom ping test
Spanning-tree
Quality of service
We are always adding more functions and tests to Netool.OS

 Netool works with



Any switch, router, bridge or any other network device that has an Ethernet port 
Switch info (including switch host-name, management IP, switch port) only works with devices that support protocols LLDP or CDP 
Tagged VLAN detection works with any switch that supports VLAN tagging 
 Netool shares with others





SMS/IMessage

Email
Evernote
Slack
Save to notes
Netool cloud
and many more

 
Support client devices

Smartphone or Tablet


 
Desktop (Coming Soon)


Cloud

 After launch we will be including one year of Netool.cloud In-app remote sharing  to all contributors. If our campaign hits a goal of $25,000 we will start development on our the rest of Netool.cloud's features.
 
What can Netool.cloud do? Netool does not require the cloud to perform any task stated above, but here is some features that Netool.cloud will allow you to do.
 Remote control

Netool lets you connect multiple devices to view test results and run tests.You can even send a link to share remote control via the local network or the cloud.

Mapping 
With our cloud system you will be able to automatically save your Netool discoveries to the cloud. You will then be able to label the discoveries, group them, share them and plot them on an upload floor plan.Plugins We will also work on building plugins for popular systems like Slack.What else can Netool do?



Remote serial console to a switch or router from your phone or from the cloud.  (with included USB cable or optional serial console cable) (will launch after beta)A bridge/router from your smart device to the rj45 port that Netool is plugged into. (will launch after beta)

Netool WIFI in AP modeConnect multiple smart devices to a single Netool with WIFI mode AP.

   Netool WIFI in client modeConnect to Netool through your WIFI or the cloud.
 

   Netool.OSNetool runs a highly customized version of linux that we call Netool.OS. We built Netool.OS to be powerful, low energy consuming and upgradable over the air.Netool.OS checks for software updates every time Netool is plugged into a port that has an internet connection. When Netool.OS discovers that there is a update available, Netool App will notify you with a small discreet icon on the top right of the screen indicating that there is an update. You can also disable automatic updates via the settings menu.

   The App

 
What is in the box?
1 - Netool network analyzer
1 - USB power cable
1 - NEMA-1 AC power adapter
1 - one foot Ethernet patch cable

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">BinBox is the brainchild of a team from <i>one family</i>, but spread around the world! The top dog (David) came up with the BinBox concept, while Ellen, based in Lisbon, looks after Sales &amp; Marketing. Ruth (back in Dublin) is the Graphic Design genius and Simon does the Social Media from Japan...so we cover ALL times zones and operate 24 hour cycles...We never stop!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541949085/ittlitccrgellitlcybw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Being the wisest ('cause he's the oldest!) David does all the product design, fabrication, engineering, purchasing etc., etc.. He has 25 years of experience in developing products for the construction industry, so he knows what is necessary to get a product like the BinBox to market. The other greenhorns are all college grads with lots of energy and enthusiasm, so they are going to do all the techie stuff while <strong>Mary is behind the scenes doing all the real work! </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Almost two years have passed from first concept to final design. A bit slow you might say, but product development is tiresome, difficult work. People often say <i>""t</i><i>he simple things are the best</i>"" without ever understanding just how much time and effort it takes to create that simple product.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Yet there must be <i>only</i> one goal when creating the ideal product - <strong>a happy customer.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">All else is subordinate and will follow on from a happy customer (<i>things like </i><i>profit, success, </i><i>riches beyond our wildest dreams...</i>)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Wheelie Bin Sizes</strong></h3>

Great questions, thanks for asking!
Wheelie Bins. You see them every day. You hate them and, looking at them now, they sure are pretty ugly. What to do?
The BinBox: We can wrap our pretty little PVC frame around ugly  wheelie bins so you only have to see them one day per week: on collection day.
 
So soon you can go from this view:

To the BinBox view:

Or to the BinBox view- with style!

 
The BinBox Features
 
High Gloss PVC Finish (White or Ivory)
Tongue & Groove Timber Effect
Optional Poster 
Product Life: 20 years
No Maintenance / No Paint
Weather-proof / Water-proof
Designed, developed, and made in Ireland
 
 

 
The BinBox Family
 
BinBox is the brainchild of a team from one family, but spread around the world! The top dog (David) came up with the BinBox concept, while Ellen, based in Lisbon, looks after Sales & Marketing. Ruth (back in Dublin) is the Graphic Design genius and Simon does the Social Media from Japan...so we cover ALL times zones and operate 24 hour cycles...We never stop!
 

 
Being the wisest ('cause he's the oldest!) David does all the product design, fabrication, engineering, purchasing etc., etc.. He has 25 years of experience in developing products for the construction industry, so he knows what is necessary to get a product like the BinBox to market. The other greenhorns are all college grads with lots of energy and enthusiasm, so they are going to do all the techie stuff while Mary is behind the scenes doing all the real work! 
Almost two years have passed from first concept to final design. A bit slow you might say, but product development is tiresome, difficult work. People often say ""the simple things are the best"" without ever understanding just how much time and effort it takes to create that simple product.
Yet there must be only one goal when creating the ideal product - a happy customer.
All else is subordinate and will follow on from a happy customer (things like profit, success, riches beyond our wildest dreams...)
 
Wheelie Bin Sizes
 
There are a huge range of Wheelie Bins on the market worldwide and initially we are supplying BinBox Kits to suit the most popular Wheelie Bins: up to 240 litre/52 gallon capacity (see typical dimensions below). 
If you have a mix of bin sizes in your garden, please email david@thebinbox.com or chat to us on our website and we will do our best to advise you. We will be supplying two different sizes of BinBox Kits but no need to worry about that when placing your order because we will contact you before delivery to make sure you are getting the most suitable BinBox Kit.
 

 
BinBox Dimensions

The BinBox is designed to be:
 

 
 Easy to ship (flat-pack)
 

 
Easy to assemble 
 
Other Features
 
Light but tough 
Weather-proof / Water-proof (essential if living in Ireland and the U.K.)
 UV proof (aka sunshine for those living in Ireland)
20-year life (yes, we have certs to prove it!)
No maintenance and no painting (garden hose will do fine)
 

Why only a half panel in the back? Because you are going to be bashing a bin into the bottom of your BinBox for years to come! The top is missing so you can't do the same with the handle/lid. 
*Please Note: All models of the BinBox Kits which are displayed on the site are production prototypes and not the final version which will arrive on your doorstep in  the New Year. Please forgive any imperfections you might observe

<h3>Boxscoop history and forward vision...</h3>
<p>2017 through 2018 we were consumed with the idea of designing a litter box that actually helps cats and their humans.  In the start of 2018 we put everything we had into producing Boxscoop 1. The idea was to spend our capital making a great product instead of marketing an idea. Naively, we figured if you make a great product people will find it.</p>
<p>It doesn't work like that. In May 2018, with our first shipment of Boxscoops coming in, we launched a flexible goal on Indiegogo to find an audience. We were unknown, Boxscoop was still on the water being shipped, and we still managed to connect with 52 amazing backers. After the campaign ended we continued to sell on our website and the numbers grew exponentially. At the beginning it was 1 per week, then 1 per day, then 10 per day, and the final weekend we sold out in September we sold 300+ in 3 days. September 17, 2018 we were completely out of stock.</p>
<p><strong>Where we are going now...</strong></p>
<p>It was expensive producing the molds and producing and shipping the Boxscoops themselves. We were left with a ton of positive and amazing feedback but without profit to continue. To scale production and make changes that will take Boxscoop to a whole new level (never stop innovating) we need 10x more sophisticated molds. Near the end of 2018 we'll launch Boxscoop 2.0 on Kickstarter and as a community we'll take Boxscoop to an infinitely better level. <a href=""http://www.theboxscoop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.theboxscoop.com</a></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Who or What is Sheets &amp; Giggles™?</h2>
<p>The world's first entirely pun-based enterprise, S&amp;G is a new brand of sustainable bedding that focuses on driving as much value to our community as possible. That includes insanely soft, sustainable bedding made from eucalyptus trees; prices that poke a finger into big box retail's eye; treating our customers like actual human beings (we buy stuff, too); regular donations of bedding to homeless shelters; and occasionally free pizza for like, no reason.</p>
<p>During May 1 - June 15, S&amp;G ran a 30-day preorder on Indiegogo to prove that there's a strong market demand for sustainable bedding (and to prove that the free market loves puns). We were over <strong>1,000%</strong> funded, got strong reviews of our sheets by major outlets like <a href=""http://forbes.com/sites/loisaltermark/2018/05/08/the-no-excuses-last-minute-mothers-day-gift-guide-for-women-who-travel/4/#145dfd3f7ae7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Forbes</a> and <a href=""https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/eucalyptus-bed-sheets-review"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Real Simple</a>, and became the largest crowdfunded Indiegogo ever for bedding!</p>

<p>Sheets &amp; Giggles’ eucalyptus sheets are manufactured via a lyocell process (boring, but extremely eco-friendly). They have higher softness and smoothness ratings than cotton, breathe better, are less prone to fade even after repeated washing, and are sustainably grown and knit.</p>
<p>S&amp;G’s sheets also manage and evaporate moisture (i.e., sweat) better than cotton, which promotes an anti-microbial environment that will help keep sheets fresh and clean. They're a hot sleeper's dream.</p>
<p>Even better news – we specifically designed our fitted sheets to have <i>extra</i> <i>deep</i> corners to easily and securely fit mattresses up to 20"" thick, so you'll sink right into your bed.</p>
<p>This is the good stuff.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Stop Buying Sheets at Retail</h2>
<p>Before starting S&amp;G, our team worked with every major retailer out there. Based on our experiences (and all the hair we pulled out), we decided to... not do that again. Major plus for you – this keeps our prices 20-40% lower than what you’d pay in a store for this high quality, eco-friendly fabric.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Production Process</h2>
<p>Based in India, our manufacturing partner is second to none when it comes to sustainable, socially responsible fabrics production. </p>
<p>S&amp;G's fabric is made out high quality eucalyptus wood pulp, a sustainable and renewable natural resource. We don't harvest wood from ancient or endangered forests; rather, our eucalyptus trees are grown on sustainably managed plantations around the world. Our manufacturer puts a major focus on on forest conservation and bio-diversity at their plantations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524003461/tyepjx9j34vtdkuorwjq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The lyocell process used to turn eucalyptus bark into our insanely smooth sheets is considered to be one of the most eco-friendly means of fabric production in the world.</p>
<p>Unlike cotton, which uses an estimated 16 - 25% of the world's insecticides, no insecticides or pesticides are used in the growth of our crops. And unlike the chemically intensive process to make viscose from bamboo, lyocell production uses relatively few chemicals and has extremely little waste product.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>S&amp;G has three main hurdles ahead to become a profitable, long-term sustainable business:</p>
<ol>
<li>A strong preorder that allows us to ship and go to market on our own terms, focusing only on our customers' wants and needs, without taking on excess debt or venture financing. </li>
<li>Successful logistics in June and July so we can ship to preorder customers by August. To make sure manufacturing and shipping is on pace, we'll be visiting our factories in India in June (which sounds... hot).</li>
<li>Turning enough profit to finance a reorder for Q1 2019 so we don't run out of inventory after any initial success.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are company risks for us that we're working diligently on, but they aren't risks for you. Unlike Internet-connected products that need an app to function (connected toilets are the future), there's no downside for you if we go under: your sheets will still be as soft as ever.

S&G: As Seen On TV

 
Unmatched Comfort
Did you know that the best sheets in the world are made from eucalyptus trees?

 
Sheets & Giggles’ eucalyptus sheets are manufactured via a lyocell process (boring, but extremely eco-friendly). They have higher softness and smoothness ratings than cotton, breathe better, are less prone to fade even after repeated washing, and are sustainably grown and knit.
S&G’s sheets also manage and evaporate moisture (i.e., sweat) better than cotton, which promotes an anti-microbial environment that will help keep sheets fresh and clean. They're a hot sleeper's dream.
Even better news – we specifically designed our fitted sheets to have extra deep corners to easily and securely fit mattresses up to 20"" thick, so you'll sink right into your bed.

Dear Supporters,

our goal was to create the best automatic self-cleaning litter box and make your life as a Cat Owner much easier by eliminating the smelly funk and daily hassle of litter box scooping.
 
This stinking problem pushed us to conceptual and hard work 
on solution of it. 
We created a reliable, comfortable and affordable Automatic self-cleaning litter box – our Smart Kitty.
 
Smart Kitty is adapted for all cats sizes and needs. To make it safe we have implemented sensors and our patented solutions.
Smart Kitty handle with waste of all sizes and scoops them to separated container, which stays closed while not used. It really works! It's efficient and requires only minimal attention.
Be sure that smell and your cat’s toilet things will not concern you anymore. 
Your cat will appreciate it very much. We are sure that you will LOVE IT too!
 

            
 Smart Kitty - The Best Invention Ever 

Absolute MUST HAVE for Cat Lovers.
 
 


 






 


We have adapted Smart Kitty to all cats' sizes and needs. To make it safe we have implemented sensors and our patented solutions. Smart Kitty handle with waste of all sizes and scoops them to separated container, which stays closed while not used. 


This way you can be sure that smell and your cat’s toilet things will not concern you anymore. 


We have kept to a minimum your participation to operate the unit.

 
 
Smart Kitty starts working and makes its job only after your cat leaves it.
 
Since now, you don’t have to worry about emptying your cat's litter box when you leave town for few days nor you are going to take a weekend trip. 
You can be confident that Your cat will benefit from hygienically clean litter box.

 

The device is constructed of 3 independent modules, each of which can easily be removed.

Such a solution is convenient and very functional. It provides fast disassembly and makes easy cleaning. 

When you are back cleaning of Smart Kitty automatic litter box is now very simple. You just replace Replaceable Waste Bags.
 
 It is so easy as changing a kitchen garbage bag every few days or weeks. 

 
        


 

 
                       


 


 

 
 

       
A few minutes after use by cat litter box, automatic cleaning process starts. Raking system allows precise separation of impurities from the gravel.
After collecting litter container opens, and droppings are placed in a special closed container for excrements in the same time preventing the extraction of odors. This is done without losing the pure grit. 
Inside the container there is interchangeable disposable molding, providing comfort and cleanliness of the device.  
 
The only action that will be done from cat owner, is to eject a filled container of excrement (depends of amounts of cats nor its sizes – every few days/week).


 
 
 
         


We followed two ideas: FUNCTIONALITY and DESIGN. 
From now litter-box can be a decoration for your home.


We wanted that Smart Kitty - automatic litter box will no longer be associated only with impurities and has not been pushed to the farthest corner of your apartment. 
From now Smart Kitty is an element of interior design thanks to its design and quality.

<br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Is heat an issue?</h3>
<p>Renderpockets was designed to be used with  ""S"" series i7 Processors such as i7-4790S or 4770S, they produce less heat and consume much less energy than the K series, the K series are meant for overclocking and require big CPU coolers inside big PC cases and are not appropriate for smaller cases with low profile CPU coolers. </p>
<p>It is possible to use CPUs other than S-Series i7, but at your own risk, you must do thorough research about what type of CPU cooler to use for other CPU types, and how much heat they produce.   Many of them require special big coolers that won't fit inside Renderpocket cases. </p>
<p>The average temperature at full load (100% Rendering) is as shown above, about 65 degrees Celsius (with i7-3770S (65W) CPU and Noctua NH-L9i CPU cooler). </p>
<p>It is recommended to use Front panel with at least 1 fan to reduce the heat.  The temperature is hotter for Stealth mode (without front fans), 10-20c hotter in some cases.</p>

<p><b>Shipping within USA and Europe: </b>I have experience with shipping within USA and to Europe, but not that much with the rest of the world.  For USA, and Europe, the shipping price is fixed, and is written on the perk you choose, please pay that extra amount via paypal when ordering.  I will also contact you before shipping to verify final payment.</p>
<p><b>Shipping for outside USA and Europe</b> the prices fluctuate too much and I cannot provide fixed fee, so please use these specs to calculate the price to your country, and add that extra payment to your pre-order purchase, I will review it and contact you individually before shipping to verify final price.  </p>

</div></div>","What is Renderpockets?




Render Pockets is an elegant DO-IT-YOURSELF solution for the IKEA Helmer Renderfarm setup.   Designed to be used with S-Series i7 Processors for lower power consumption and smaller energy bills, but yet powerful enough to render anything!

Instead of cutting all the metal parts, this lasercut plexiglas kit will simply slide into each drawer, making it quick and easy to assemble your own CPU based (perfect for Vray and Corona users) renderfarm in matter of minutes!


""The most ambitious Ikea- Hack ever"" Fab-Lab Berlin




Some of the benefits of using Ikea Helmer Renderfam  


Very compact and lightweight


Affordable (Almost 40% Cheaper than Equivalent Dual Xeon system)


Fits under the desk / space saver




Low energy consumption (~150W per node) 


Powerful Intel i7 processor  (Total 24 Cores / 48 Threads render power)!



Recommended - i7-4790S (65W), for low energy consumption and at the same time powerful enough to render anything -  which also results in less heat and smaller power bill! 


Swappable faceplates



up to 32GB RAM (With  200mm wide mATX board or mini-ITX up to 16GB)



Economy Friendly - Assemble your renderfarm, one node at a time!






Premium Faceplate - Front fans, sensor and power switch cutouts




Minimal Faceplate - 1 front fan cutout 
Many faceplate options coming soon!



Free with the purchase of Renderpocket Kit.

If campaign is successful, there will be new faceplate variations, right now only minimal and premium faceplates are available as advertised in black or white.  If you would like custom color, please contact me.







Why I need funding?
Since it is a very niche, one of a kind product on the market, I do not know how many people will be interested so I cannot take on the risk on producing hundreds of cases on my own. With your help, I will know for sure how many cases I will have to make and exactly how many screws, nuts, and fan grills will I have to purchase.  

It is not cheap to produce this plexiglas lasercut case. However, I found one factory that is willing to offer small discount for a minimum order of 300 cases, it is very rare, usually factories do not offer much of a discount for under 10,000 units.  




If you feel the price is beyond your budget, you are welcomed to purchase Renderpocket Lasercut files and lasercut as many cases as you wish by yourself, there are no restrictions, the files are yours to modify and do whatever you wish!

Prices








After this campaign, the prices will be 10-20% higher, because it will be based per individual order, which costs more to produce vs the group order.


BONUS!


Assembly Guide
Each purchase of Renderpockets will also include an Assembly Guide, which will explain how to assemble all the parts, and show steps how to put all the computer hardware into place. 
Render Node Manager (Special Offer)!




Renderpockets partnered up with Pixamoon to provide you with their upcoming renderfarm management software!
It is still in development, and should be available soon. When you purchase 3 Renderpockets Bundle you will get 50% off discount, and by purchasing 6 Renderpockets Bundle you will get this software totally FREE! 
You can find more info about the capabilities of RNM on scriptspot.
The Idea (hobby project)
The whole thing begun when I had crazy deadlines at work and I had to spend nights waiting for my computer to finish rendering, it was a disaster when I had to render during the day, because I couldn't use my computer until it finished rendering, and sometimes 1 rendering took 8 hours or more!  
So I began searching for better options, I couldn't afford a powerful $10,000 Dual Xeon state of the art machine, so I looked at cheaper options, unfortunately many retailers sold computers with low quality parts and they had the latest i7 CPU but other specs were not that good for rendering.  







I then looked at Rack Server systems, they were heavy and expensive, plus I had very little room at my apartment in New York and couldn't put huge rack system with all the wires exposed and stuff, so this was not an option.  Then one day I came across DIY Helmer Renderfarm setup on the internet (google it now and there are dozens of them!)  it was a really cool idea, 6 cheap (about $750 each) render nodes combined together to create a powerful personal renderfarm, for almost half the price of equivalent Dual Xeon beast!  

With Helmer Renderfarm, I no longer have to worry about crazy deadlines, final renderings are done under 1 hour! I can also render 6 views at the same time, and making animations is fun again! This way I was able to take on more work and wait less! 


Time and Money Savings
This kit doesn't just saves you time (making your own Helmer Renderfarm), it also saves you money, you do not need to buy expensive power tools (drill, dremel kit, protective cutting equipment, special metal cutting parts, etc, costs about $300).  The time savings are enormous, I spent countless hours cutting the metal parts, it was a trial and error process, because no matter how accurate you mark up the metal parts, you still get some error and at the end some things don't line up perfectly...  
With Renderpockets, you also save your Ikea Helmer cabinet for future use, instead of totally destroying it!


Prototyping
The prototyping has gone through many stages in the span of about 2 years! Most of the latest prototyping was done at a local laser-cutting lab in Berlin, Germany (Fab-Lab Berlin). So most of the design was engineered in Germany.  They liked my idea so much that they even showcased it on their BLOG! 





Almost every possible layout configuration was tested, even 2-in-1 system was constructed (2 computers in 1 drawer - ""not recommended"", possible with with pico-PSU), but the final configuration was chosen based on 4 important features: 

Air ventilation (vent holes and fan locations strategically placed)  
Portability / Expend-ability (quickly dis-assemble and transport, expend the design by snapping new parts as they become available soon) 
Ease of assembly (easily snap parts together without screws)
Make it look cool!

</div></div>","A Pretty, Nerdy Cheese Board. We are designers, engineers, artists, makers...and we end up doing a lot of client work. So the team at Studio KMD formed Small Batch: a place where we can make beautiful and useful objects to share with the masses. 


We developed LIGNA / CUPRUM Board No. 15 after learning about last year's discovery of the 15th convex pentagon to tessellate, or tile the plane. This is a big deal because for the last 30 years, there were only 14 known pentagons with this ability—little buggers are tough to find! We think the new shape is a looker, and we hope you agree. 

We've also been hard at work developing our own method of pressing a gorgeous copper rivet into wood. We love how the bright copper plays with cool, clean maple and rich black walnut. Please support our campaign so we can bring this beauty to market. And tell your friends!


What We Need & What You Get
 We've set a goal of $15,000 for this campaign in the hopes of investing in some new tooling and equipment, as well as much-needed high-five lessons for our buddy Drew (watch the video). This will allow us to bring our beloved board to market more efficiently.
When you support our campaign, you'll be first in line to snag your own LIGNA / CUPRUM Board No. 15 at a price well below retail. Perks include one, two, three, four, or ten boards in your choice of maple, walnut, or a combination of the two. Keep them all and make your own tabletop tessellation, or knock a few people off your shopping list nice and early this year.


Shipping and Fulfillment
We're excited to start getting these items out to our supporters and will begin fulfilling orders as soon as the first batch of boards is complete. At the moment, we can not supply perks to our international supporters. We're working to resolve this internal issue with shipping; join our international mailing list for updates regarding our progress.



Risks & Challenges  Honestly, we've got this thing pretty well worked out. We've made some of these already with our existing equipment, so even if we fall short of our goal and can't get new tools, you'll still get your perks as though we had. In addition to that, we've already done a very successful crowdfunding campaign (our Pick Your Poison Decanters), from which every single order went out on time.

We envisioned Fresh Portal™ owners waking up to freshly brewed Carmel Roasting Co. cappucino delivered and ready to be enjoyed. This was at a time when food delivery services were just emerging and before Amazon came out with their locker program. Since then, Fresh Portal™ has been fully designed, we have applied and been granted a patent, secured a local engineering firm, designed the software and PCB behind the product and now we are seeking to raise funds for the <i>production-ready-prototype</i> and we will then begin shipping and installations.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">(USTPO Patent No. 10729265.7)</p><p>                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598377530/oi9rhdbp1rt3tvtpr1oz.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598383609/pyctnowz4jyb3egh6aoc.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598383745/drpmhc6aw5da3kbkllmp.png"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How Fresh Portal™ Works</h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">Fresh Portal™ is an appliance installed into an exterior wall of your home or office. A <strong>securely locked</strong> exterior door is accessible to delivery persons using a unique one-time access-code sent to their device over your existing WiFi network. A locked interior door gives you personal access to the delivery products. Fresh Portal™ has the ability to safely control temperature based on the needs of the particular delivery - your meals can be kept cool or warm and you can adjust the temperature so that your temperature sensitive medications or packages can be kept safe. Fresh Portal™ units are designed with <strong>two temperature zones</strong>. In a single delivery you can have hot pizza in one zone and cold beverages in another. The <strong>Far-UVC disinfection</strong> light cycle automatically runs every time a delivery occurs. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Reduced contact delivery keeps you healthier.</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Fresh Portal’s™ ability to receive deliveries when you’re not home gives you <strong>peace of mind</strong>. You control everything from an app on your personal smart device. Notifications and live video allow you to monitor activity whenever activity occurs.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598381940/nkkh2jfmpjdueflhbuvw.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Fresh Portal™ Construction &amp; Durability</h2><p style=""text-align: center;"">The patented design of the Fresh Portal™ has three main components.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Mount Box</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Interior Door</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Exterior Door</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The mount box is permanently installed.

The Fresh Portal™ features advanced multipurpose delivery receiving solutions, remotely controlled via Fresh Portal™ app and WiFi that incorporates Far-UVC disinfection, package security, and climate control into a single household appliance. The Fresh Portal™ keeps delivered groceries and prepared food fresh and temperature controlled until you can collect it into your own home.  The Fresh Portal™ is also the solution for temperature sensitive medications.The Fresh Portal™ is the ideal delivery solution for the modern home.$3,450 Installed**Price includes a standard installation with one added electrical location.    The Fresh Portal™ will help our customers harness all emerging delivery options, to the benefit of keeping their families healthier and safer. The Fresh Portal’s™ new technology will facilitate a direct-to-consumer and eco-friendly supply-chain by inspiring concepts like farm-to-table, improving freshness and reducing single-use waste. The Fresh Portal™ StoryThe Fresh Portal™ idea came to life in 2015 when three professionals in the Carmel, California luxury building market were trying to design a fresh food delivery solution so their customers could focus on enjoying the weather rather than running for groceries. We envisioned Fresh Portal™ owners waking up to freshly brewed Carmel Roasting Co. cappucino delivered and ready to be enjoyed. This was at a time when food delivery services were just emerging and before Amazon came out with their locker program. Since then, Fresh Portal™ has been fully designed, we have applied and been granted a patent, secured a local engineering firm, designed the software and PCB behind the product and now we are seeking to raise funds for the production-ready-prototype and we will then begin shipping and installations.(USTPO Patent No. 10729265.7)                         How Fresh Portal™ WorksFresh Portal™ is an appliance installed into an exterior wall of your home or office. A securely locked exterior door is accessible to delivery persons using a unique one-time access-code sent to their device over your existing WiFi network. A locked interior door gives you personal access to the delivery products. Fresh Portal™ has the ability to safely control temperature based on the needs of the particular delivery - your meals can be kept cool or warm and you can adjust the temperature so that your temperature sensitive medications or packages can be kept safe. Fresh Portal™ units are designed with two temperature zones. In a single delivery you can have hot pizza in one zone and cold beverages in another. The Far-UVC disinfection light cycle automatically runs every time a delivery occurs. Reduced contact delivery keeps you healthier.Fresh Portal’s™ ability to receive deliveries when you’re not home gives you peace of mind. You control everything from an app on your personal smart device. Notifications and live video allow you to monitor activity whenever activity occurs. Fresh Portal™ Construction & DurabilityThe patented design of the Fresh Portal™ has three main components.  Mount BoxInterior DoorExterior DoorThe mount box is permanently installed. It is made of the highest quality stainless steel and is corrosion resistive. The mount box contains zero moving parts - it will stand the test of time!The interior and exterior door components include all of the Fresh Portal™ mechanical features. These parts are made of the most durable powder coated steel. They are the moving pieces of the Fresh Portal™ and, as such, may wear out over time. A manufacturer warranty will be available and replacement parts will be available.How is Fresh Portal™ Installed?Fresh Portal™ installation is much like adding a window to your home. A certified Fresh Portal™ installer cuts a template into your interior and exterior wall finishes between stud bays (or similar for masonry) using dust mitigation technology. The mount box is inserted and affixed and then insulated and waterproofed just like a window. We attach the interior component and the exterior component, together accounting for 100% of the moving parts. The Fresh Portal's™ weather-proof seal is tested and perfected. Your installer will then power it on, connect it to your wifi and you will download and install the Fresh Portal™ app to your preferred devices. Once paired with your devices, your installation is complete. You can customize your Fresh Portal™ app settings and then simply enjoy.How will the Fresh Portal™ app Integrate with Food Delivery Providers?The Fresh Portal™ app will be your go-to app for food delivery - whether it's fresh groceries or prepared foods. Within the Fresh Portal™ app you will have access to local farmers, grocers, restaurants and established food delivery providers. As our technology matures, we'll continue streamlining vendor-partner communication with the goal of providing the one-click 'Deliver to my Fresh Portal™' option. For example, within the Fresh Portal™ app, order dinner by searching for your favorite restaurant, place your order and adjust the temperature zones. The app will notify the restaurant of your order and then provide a one time access code to be shared with the delivery driver. The driver uses the one time access code manually or the wifi and Bluetooth technology automatically open your Fresh Portal™ door as he approaches. He places your dinner inside the Fresh Portal™, he taps the door to auto close and he leaves (it will auto close if he forgot).

<p><i>Light Paint HiR</i> is a new way to create innovative
tutorials, paint unique pictures, and project live visuals
during dance parties and music shows.  The real fun happens in the ""live art creation"" modes, where the light is retained and tracked, creating a live canvas on any screen or projection surface. </p>
<p>The paint brush can be your
body or light sources such as flashlights, LED hula hoops, spinning
fire and our newly prototyped LED painting tools. Now everyone can be
the star of the show while seeing themselves in a whole new

<p>With Light Paint HiR, light painting can now be brought to real world surfaces by incorporating a projector, and facing the camera at the projection surface, allowing the painter to 'draw' right on the projection surface with light. Because the light is 'mapped' to the surface, we have dubbed this technique:</p>

</div></div>","Light Paint HiR (Hyper Interactive Reality)We are a small team of highly motivated and creative individuals, whohave come together to create the world's coolest new light painting, VJing and multimedia production tool: Introducing Light Paint HiR! What is Light Painting?
Light Paint HiR is inspired by a relatively new form of painting with light, called by many names; ""light painting"", ""light graffiti"", ""light art"" and ""long-exposure photography"", where one can create stunning images by leaving the exposure of a camera open in a dark setting, and then selectively ""paint in the scene"" using different light sources.  This ""painting with light"" has traditionally been done using higher-end digital cameras and ""old school film cameras"", but not any more!

(A simple 'Light Painted' scene captured using Light Paint HiR)
So what is Light Paint HiR?

Light Paint HiR software allows for the real-time capture of images, video and audio, allowing you to save your unique art creations with a user-friendly interface. Turn an average webcam into a real-time digital multimedia production tool!We are now making this very cool new art form available to the masses!


(the creator of Light Paint HiR briefly describes what LPHiR is)
What can lpHiR do?






Light Paint HiR is a new way to create innovative
tutorials, paint unique pictures, and project live visuals
during dance parties and music shows.  The real fun happens in the ""live art creation"" modes, where the light is retained and tracked, creating a live canvas on any screen or projection surface. 
The paint brush can be your
body or light sources such as flashlights, LED hula hoops, spinning
fire and our newly prototyped LED painting tools. Now everyone can be
the star of the show while seeing themselves in a whole new
light.

With Light Paint HiR, light painting can now be brought to real world surfaces by incorporating a projector, and facing the camera at the projection surface, allowing the painter to 'draw' right on the projection surface with light. Because the light is 'mapped' to the surface, we have dubbed this technique:
'Projection Mapped Light Painting'



(an example of a 'Projection Mapped Light Painting')

Video
production artists can seamlessly apply real-time effects and filters
to video, images or camera streams on the fly using a simple user interface. This offers a new way
to edit video that is visually appealing and unlike anything
experienced before.

(a short video demonstrating light painting with a video blended in lpHiR)


Your
contributions will allow us to move forward and make this evolutionarynew
tool available to the world. 
The software is currently ONLY available for Linux, however our goal is to make it cross platform so
it can be enjoyed on OSx, Windows, tablets and smart phones.  The good news is that if you own a computer that does not have Linux installed, you can simply choose our ""Bootable USB PenDrive Perk"" to run Light Paint HiR.
We have created a new paradigm in
human-computer interaction that goes far beyond your mouse and a keyboard... and it keeps getting better.This project is allowing us to continue developing more Open Source tools, such as motion controlled user interfaces and software to help people overcome their movement based disabilities. We want to see a more creative, enabled world using the technology we already have at our fingertips.
We need this funding to ensure we have the energy and resources to give ample support to our fans and make the experience even easier for everyone to use.


Support us so we can support your Creativity
Monies received from this campaign will go towards:


Offering one on one support for ""early adoptors""

Creating Light Paint HiR video tutorials


Maintaining FAQ's, member's forum and user gallery

Development of Cross-platform versions (OSX, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.)
Paying back investors that helped us get this far
Paying our developers for their time and efforts
Contributing to the Open Source projects used in LPHiR

Plus further development of Light Paint HiR features such as:




Voice, MIDI, and motion controlled interface features.
Developing a smart phone interface for remote control.
Adding cool new effects and filters
An automation system and timeline control

So we can use this on our mac's/pc's?
For non Linux users, we have created a bootable flash drive that allows the software to work on PC's that meet the minimum requirements. This will allow you to ""Plug and Paint"". Features include a full user interface allowing real time changing of multiple filters and effects while capturing the audio, video in good quality. Light Paint HiR is now running at multiple test sites, so we know we are ready to release this software to the public.  We will do our best to support you in getting it up and running so you can get down to some seriously fun creativity!

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU !!!!!!A little about me and how I got started
I've always loved cooking and baking and developing new recipes in the kitchen. 
 That love and some winning recipes landed me on the Food Network on “Grill It! With Bobby Flay”. I saw a need for great tasting gluten free snacks and starting trying out a few recipes that included cakes, brownies, muffins,  delicate pastries, and of course cookies! In 2014, I introduced  my baked goods to then Executive chef Joshua Drew at FARMSHOP in Brentwood, CA and Kitchen Table products was born. They now carry my Gluten Free Mini Chocolate Chip Cookies. More flavors soon to come like:Ginger MolassesPeanut ButterAlmond ButterMocha Espresso Coconut MacaroonWhole Grain / OatmealIced Lemon

Risks and Challenges

California is the epicenter of the artisan food business. I was able to start my business because of the California’s Cottage Food industry program. However, the challenge for new  artisan producers making high end quality products is how to scale up at an affordable cost, which is why many of the current small commercial kitchens for lease allow entrepreneurs to share space for rent by the hour. Cottage Food businesses are also restricted to making less than $50,000 annually in sales.
Also, regulatory requirements have complicated the transition from selling goods at local retail shops to distributing them wholesale to large grocery store chains (like Wholefoods or Trader Joe’s). Wholsale buyers have stricter health standards than local retailers, requiring significant upfront investment by small batch artisans.

In the issue of  sharing a commercial kitchen, you are more susceptible to the cleanliness of others sharing the kitchen and the possible loss and/or disappearance of inventory and an expensive endeavor without much control. 


With that said, we understand that there will be many challenges as with any business in the growth stages. We are confident in our product(s) that we will be successful in this journey and will be transparent through this process ad reach our sales goals.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The QUIDNON project aims to make kits available for DIY construction of a very versatile houseboat: a tiny house that is also a sailboat. It will measure 36 feet by 16 feet and combine high-tech kit production techniques and rapid, low-tech DIY assembly.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491319528/tfwfftqxf7pl6ulnmmh4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I have been living aboard with my family and sailing the Eastern Seaboard of the US for the last decade. QUIDNON's design incorporates hundreds of design features hard-won through my personal experience.</p>
<p>Two years ago I came up with this project, put my thoughts together on a <a href=""http://quidnon.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> and started gathering feedback and suggestions from other experienced live-aboards and custom boat-builders.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491319660/ajbqg3gjssgn9qxnlpas.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A year ago two other engineers joined the cause. We have put together a detailed 3D model of the design and built and tested a radio-controlled scale model. The tests went extremely well, with no surprises except for how well the model sailed.</p>
<p>We are now ready to build the first full-scale hull. So far we have been donating our time to the project and using free or donated software. But for the next step we have to buy software licenses, tools, other resources and specialized expertise.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to be able to license software, pay for access to equipment and for workshop space, engage a marine architect to review and approve the design, and buy the materials needed to complete and equip the first hull. If there is money left over, we will compensate ourselves, but what we want out of this process is QUIDNONS—for ourselves and for whoever wants one. We want to make QUIDNON kits available for delivery in 2018.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Given the high rents and real estate prices, living aboard is a major lifehack—something that can help people, especially young families, to live well and stay out of debt. But most boats are not designed with that in mind, but for sport or luxury. QUIDNON combines a roomy interior, rugged construction and sailing ability in a single affordable package. All of the assembly and construction can be done DIY by moderately skilled people. The boat comes as a kit that comes together like a piece of IKEA furniture and can be put together quickly near a beach or a riverbank barn-raising style and then launched by pushing it to the water.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The technical risks for this project are minimal because the construction technique (fiberglass over plywood) has been extensively tested and because this design has already been tested out in software simulation and on a radio-controlled scale model. The biggest risk is that the funds we raise will be insufficient to complete and test the first hull later this year and the project will move forward more slowly than we are planning. At an absolute minimum we will produce the data needed to fabricate kits and will self-finance the construction of the first hull.</p>

For TridoⓇ we utilize multiple powerful neodymium magnets on each side of each shape. TRIDO® IN THE MEDIA IS TRIDO® FOR CHILDREN OR ADULTS?YES and YES! TRIDO is a toy for all ages, perfect for any number of uses, including fidgeting, relaxation, idea boosting, and playtime. You can play with TRIDO on your own or in a group, and you can even invent your own TRIDO uses. For example imagine playing magnetic Jenga with it!The play is not just essential for kids; it can be an important source of relaxation and stimulation for adults as well. Playing is a sure and fun way to fuel your imagination, creativity, problem-solving abilities, abstract thinking and emotional well-being.TRIDO will unleash the world of 3D geometry right before your very eyes. 


Children can explore concepts in science, geometry and math, while they develop motor skills, reasoning, and dimensional and spatial thinking. But most importantly, they'll have fun while doing it. 
 You can always find your own way to play with TRIDO as we assume there are plenty of amusement things we haven’t thought about. 
   Creating stuff with TridoⓇ is easy and satisfying
        Put it in your room as an element of decoration.   Have fun sticking it to some iron objects.  Or just get it with your coffee :)   
Anyone can create spectacular looking shapes with a few snaps and will simply have no time to get bored. 


 
Half-Tetrahedron unlike other shapes has different faces and brings great diversity to TridoⓇ.

 
Having a stressful day and need a moment to relax or to do something with your hands? Keep a set of TRIDO with you.    
   We've paid special attention to choosing colours and balancing Octa/Tetra/Half-Tetra ratio to make sure that Trido is optimized for play.

<p><b><i><u><br/></u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>FAQ</u></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><u><br/></u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>What does Irepasse do?</u></i></b></p>
<p>  The
Irepasse simultaneously dries and irons shirts, polo shirts, sweatshirts,
T-shirts, shorts, skirts, pants, jeans, jackets, coats &amp; many more. The
Irepasse can accommodate sizes XS to XXL for tops and sizes 26 to 50 for
bottoms. It works with almost all fabrics; cotton, linen, flannel, silk, mixed
cotton-polyester &amp; many more, excluding mesh wool.</p>
<p>  It
works for different style shirts; long-sleeve, short or long neck with Italian,
French, semi Francese, button down or Korean. It even works on cuffs &amp;
collared shirts, capable of most types of fabrics and able to maintain longer
unaltered fibers.</p>
<p><b><i><u>How does Irepasse work?</u></i></b></p>
<p>  It
only takes a few seconds! Place your wet garment after spin cycleon the appropriate inflatable bust or legs (supplied
by Irepasse), arrange the central tensor and start up your Irepasse to inflate
with hot air. A quick check that your garment is properly placed and the
Irepasse will do the rest!</p>
<p>  Within
minutes the hot air will dry the fabric as well as keeping the garment taut,
making your clothes ready to be worn or put in the closet.</p>
<p><b><i><u></u></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><u></u></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><u>Why is Irepasse so
important?</u></i></b></p>
<p>  -Millions
of people in the world hate to iron!</p>
<p>  -You
have enough household chores!!</p>
<p>  -More
free time for you!</p>
<p>  -Effortless!</p>
<p>  -Save
money! No need to take your clothes to the Dry Cleaners or hire a maid!</p>
<p>-Environmental!
Irepasse uses only air, no treatments, no chemicals &amp; they are  100% recyclable!</p>
<p>-Fabric
protection! Irepasse gently dries and irons at a temperature no higher then 55°C;
131°F. This allows the fibers in the fabric to last longer, unlike the stress
of a hot iron of up to 200°C; 392°F.</p>
<p>-Free from
weather conditions! Rain, cold, humid means longer drying time (up to 24hrs)
and if you live in the city, your clothes may smell like smog from long drying
times. Rain or shine Irepasse has quick drying times!</p>
<p>-Comfort of
wearing your garment dried &amp; ironed after just a few minutes, compared to
the traditional time of drying on a clothes line (must have room), then get the
out the iron (need more room)!</p>
<p>-Eliminate the
risk of harm to humans and garments produced by the use of ironing. Such as
those relating to the folds, glossy reflections, buttons ruined, burns to
garments &amp; humans, especially children. 
</p>
<p>-Puts life back
into your garments with vertical ironing &amp; drying!</p>
<p>-Irepasse,
thanks to their practicality, is also used as a fan heater with heat diffusion
of 360 degrees. </p>

FAQ
What does Irepasse do?
  The
Irepasse simultaneously dries and irons shirts, polo shirts, sweatshirts,
T-shirts, shorts, skirts, pants, jeans, jackets, coats & many more. The
Irepasse can accommodate sizes XS to XXL for tops and sizes 26 to 50 for
bottoms. It works with almost all fabrics; cotton, linen, flannel, silk, mixed
cotton-polyester & many more, excluding mesh wool.
  It
works for different style shirts; long-sleeve, short or long neck with Italian,
French, semi Francese, button down or Korean. It even works on cuffs &
collared shirts, capable of most types of fabrics and able to maintain longer
unaltered fibers.
How does Irepasse work?
  It
only takes a few seconds! Place your wet garment after spin cycleon the appropriate inflatable bust or legs (supplied
by Irepasse), arrange the central tensor and start up your Irepasse to inflate
with hot air. A quick check that your garment is properly placed and the
Irepasse will do the rest!
  Within
minutes the hot air will dry the fabric as well as keeping the garment taut,
making your clothes ready to be worn or put in the closet.


Why is Irepasse so
important?
  -Millions
of people in the world hate to iron!
  -You
have enough household chores!!
  -More
free time for you!
  -Effortless!
  -Save
money! No need to take your clothes to the Dry Cleaners or hire a maid!
-Environmental!
Irepasse uses only air, no treatments, no chemicals & they are  100% recyclable!
-Fabric
protection! Irepasse gently dries and irons at a temperature no higher then 55°C;
131°F. This allows the fibers in the fabric to last longer, unlike the stress
of a hot iron of up to 200°C; 392°F.
-Free from
weather conditions! Rain, cold, humid means longer drying time (up to 24hrs)
and if you live in the city, your clothes may smell like smog from long drying
times. Rain or shine Irepasse has quick drying times!
-Comfort of
wearing your garment dried & ironed after just a few minutes, compared to
the traditional time of drying on a clothes line (must have room), then get the
out the iron (need more room)!
-Eliminate the
risk of harm to humans and garments produced by the use of ironing. Such as
those relating to the folds, glossy reflections, buttons ruined, burns to
garments & humans, especially children. 

-Puts life back
into your garments with vertical ironing & drying!
-Irepasse,
thanks to their practicality, is also used as a fan heater with heat diffusion
of 360 degrees. 
How fast does Irepasse
work?
  Shirts:
Between 7 to 12 minutes*
  Pants:
Between 10-15 minutes*
* Average time may vary depending on fabric
type & dampness.

<h2>SLOW CONTENT in a TAKE AWAY BOX?</h2>
<h2>The irony of life.</h2>
<p>Our take away seed box expresses the irony of our convenient and fast-paced lives – contrary to fast-food in take-out boxes, the content of our seed boxes requires patience and time in order to value and enjoy the results. We want to create awareness that great things take time and to remind us to SLOW DOWN A LITTLE.</p>
<p>We are ""hungry"" for a connection with nature – aren’t you? Why not take a little piece of nature home - our seed boxes will do just that!</p>
<h2>SLOW CONTENT in einer TAKE AWAY BOX? Die Ironie des Lebens.</h2>
<p>Unsere Samenbox ""to go"" drückt die Ironie unseres bequemen und schnelllebigen Lebens aus - im Gegensatz zu Fast-Food in Take-Away-Boxen erfordert der Inhalt unserer Samenbox Geduld und Zeit, um die Ergebnisse zu schätzen und zu genießen.

<li>There are hundreds of wonderful native plants growing all around us in the wild and we want to curate more collection boxes of plant communities for various regions, soils and light conditions.</li>
<li>We need to pre-order seeds well in advance because most plants are cultivated on demand and we want to ensure their availability. After all, seeds are not an unlimited resource.</li>
<li>From each sold seed box we want to donate and amount to the BGCI charity - this means we still need to sell approximately 2000 boxes to reach our first sustainability milestone: to sponsor a seed collecting expedition !</li>
<li>We want to showcase and promote our products at fairs and exhibitions which involve high set up costs.</li>
<li>We want to customize and optimize the packaging of our products to limit waste. This is only possible and affordable if we order in larger quantities. </li>
<li>Help us obtain the European Organic label! Although we already purchase organic seeds where available, we need to get verified in order to use the European organic label. </li>

<li>Es gibt Hunderte von wunderbaren einheimischen Pflanzen die um uns herum in der Natur wachsen und wir wollen mehr Saatgutboxen mit Samenmischungen für verschiedene Regionen, Böden und Lichtverhältnisse herstellen.</li>

<li>Hilf uns dabei das europäische Bio-Label zu erhalten! Obwohl wir bereits Bio-Samen kaufen, müssen wir, um das europäische Bio-Label zu verwenden, zertifiziert werden.</li>
<li>Von jeder verkauften Saatgutbox wollen wir einen Betrag an die BGCI spenden - das bedeutet, dass wir noch ca. 2000 Boxen verkaufen müssen, um unseren ersten Nachhaltigkeits-Meilenstein zu erreichen - eine Saatgut-Expedition zu sponsern!</li>
<li>Wir wollen unsere Produkte auf Messen und Ausstellungen präsentieren, die leider mit hohen Einrichtungskosten verbunden sind.</li>
<li>Wir wollen die Verpackung unserer Produkte anpassen und optimieren, um den Verpackungsabfall zu minimieren.

<h2><strong>A1 Wall Calendar 2018.</strong></h2>
<p>One would think we are old-fashioned in today’s digital world by offering a wall calendar. But how often are you on your phone in the office and need a quick overview of all your appointments at one glance? Furthermore, we haven’t actually seen a wall calendar <strong>that makes an office space a little greener: so we created one!</strong> We want this to be a true international and multi-cultural calendar – suitable for everyone in the world. That’s why we haven’t included any bank holidays. The calendar is in English and shows the work weeks. The calendar is A1 sized and printed on 170g/m2 <strong>recycled and Blue Angel labelled paper</strong>.</p>
<h2>A1 Wandkalender 2018.</h2>
<p>Man würde denken, dass wir in der heutigen digitalen Welt altmodisch sind, indem wir einen Wandkalender anbieten. Aber wie oft ist man im Büro am Telefon und braucht einen schnellen Überblick über alle Termine? Ausserdem haben wir noch keinen Wandkalender gesehen, der eine Bürofläche etwas grüner macht - deswegen haben wir einen entworfen! Wir wollen, dass dies ein echter internationaler und multikultureller Kalender ist - der für jeden auf der Welt geeignet ist. Deshalb werden keine Feiertage angezeigt. Der Kalender ist auf Englisch und bildet die Arbeitswochen ab. Der Kalender ist auf 170g/m2 recyceltem Blauer Engel Papier gedruckt.</p>

<h2><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our History. </span></h2>
</div><p>With a particular affinity for forests and wild spaces, we started the Blog “WALD &amp; Co” (Wald meaning forest in German) a few years ago. Blogging with the philosophy “take a little piece of forest home” we write about harvesting plants and fruits from the forest and share recipes. After visiting several public and private gardens and parks, we noticed that strangely most gardens bear little resemblance to nature.</p><p>It was then a natural progression to create the <strong>seed box FOREST TREASURES</strong>, which takes our philosophy literally by taking a piece of forest home. Our first seed collection box contains, according to us, the real treasures of our forests: woodruff, wild strawberries and wild garlic. The plants and fruits not only look pretty, but they can also be used in various recipes and have traditional medicinal values. We looked around us and got inspired by nature to curate this special seed collection with plants that grow naturally within close vicinity.</p><p><i><strong>""We strongly believe that nature has a positive balancing impact upon us"".</strong> </i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p><h2><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Unsere Geschichte. </span></h2><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Mit einer besonderen Affinität zu Wäldern und der Natur haben wir vor einigen Jahren den Blog ""Wald &amp; Co” begonnen. Auf dem Blog mit der Philosophie ""hol dir ein kleines Stückchen Wald nach Hause "" schreiben wir u.a. über die Ernte von Pflanzen und Früchten aus dem Wald und teilen Rezepte. Nach dem Besuch von mehreren öffentlichen und privaten Gärten und Parks, bemerkten wir, dass die meisten Gärten wenig Ähnlichkeit mit der Natur haben.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Es war dann für uns selbstverständlich die Samenbox WALDSCHÄTZE zu kreieren, die unsere Philosophie buchstäblich übernimmt: hol dir ein Stückchen Wald nach Hause. Unsere erste Saatgut-Box enthält für uns die wahren Schätze unserer Wälder: Waldmeister, wilde Erdbeeren und Bärlauch. Die Pflanzen und Früchte sehen nicht nur schön aus, sondern können auch in verschiedenen Rezepten verwendet werden und haben traditionelle Heilwerte. Wir sahen uns um und wurden von der Natur inspiriert um diese spezielle Saatgutmischung zu entwickeln.</span></p><p><strong><i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">""Wir glauben fest daran, dass die Natur einen positiven Einfluss auf uns hat.""</span></i></strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501097384/sqtbqvqvwso9zeivvxga.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p><div>

<h2>Our Seeds.</h2>
<p>We completely avoid collecting seeds from plants growing in the wild as it can severely deplete the natural seed bank. Our seeds come from well-established and respectable seed suppliers where wild flowers are cultivated for seed collection purposes. We want to become fully organic where possible.</p>
<h2>Unser Saatgut.</h2>
<p>Wir vermeiden das Sammeln von Samen von Pflanzen, die in der Wildnis wachsen, da sich sonst die natürliche Samenbank stark abbauen würde. Unser Saatgut kommt von etablierten und respektablen Saatgutlieferanten, die wilde Blumen für die Saatguternte anbauen. Wir wollen möglichst biologisch-zertifizierte Samen verwenden.</p>

SLOW CONTENT in a TAKE AWAY BOX?
The irony of life.
Our take away seed box expresses the irony of our convenient and fast-paced lives – contrary to fast-food in take-out boxes, the content of our seed boxes requires patience and time in order to value and enjoy the results. We want to create awareness that great things take time and to remind us to SLOW DOWN A LITTLE.
We are ""hungry"" for a connection with nature – aren’t you? Why not take a little piece of nature home - our seed boxes will do just that!

Wir wollen ein Bewusstsein schaffen, dass große Dinge Zeit brauchen und uns daran erinnern, alles etwas LANGSAMER ANGEHEN ZU LASSEN.
Wir sind ""hungrig"" auf eine Verbindung mit der Natur - du auch? Warum nicht ein kleines Stück Natur mit nach Hause nehmen - unsere Samenboxen machen genau das!

Sustainability.WALD & Co is donating 5% of the income of the Forest Treasure Seed Box to Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI). BGCI is working to conserve plant diversity worldwide and tackle the threats that are endangering the survival of many species. Our first milestone is to sponsor a seed collecting expedition as part of BGCI’s Global Seed Conservation Challenge. We still need to sell 2000 of our Forest Treasure Seed Boxes! Please support us to reach our first milestone! Nachhaltigkeit.Wald & Co spendet 5% des Einkommens aus dem Verkauf der Saatgutmischungen an Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI). BGCI arbeitet daran, die Pflanzenvielfalt weltweit zu bewahren und die Bedrohungen zu bewältigen, die das Überleben vieler Arten gefährden. Unser erster Meilenstein ist es, eine Expedition für Samensammlung als Teil der BGCI Global Seed Conservation Challenge zu sponsern. Wir müssen noch 2000 von unseren Saatgut Boxen Wald Schätze verkaufen! Bitte unterstützen Sie uns dabei den ersten Meilenstein zu erreichen!Our Vision and why we need your help.“We want to bring back a little wilderness into our gardens in an authentic and sustainable way by reconnecting with nature through an assortment of wild plants.”
There are hundreds of wonderful native plants growing all around us in the wild and we want to curate more collection boxes of plant communities for various regions, soils and light conditions.
We need to pre-order seeds well in advance because most plants are cultivated on demand and we want to ensure their availability. After all, seeds are not an unlimited resource.
From each sold seed box we want to donate and amount to the BGCI charity - this means we still need to sell approximately 2000 boxes to reach our first sustainability milestone: to sponsor a seed collecting expedition !
We want to showcase and promote our products at fairs and exhibitions which involve high set up costs.
We want to customize and optimize the packaging of our products to limit waste. This is only possible and affordable if we order in larger quantities. 
Help us obtain the European Organic label! Although we already purchase organic seeds where available, we need to get verified in order to use the European organic label. 
Unsere Vision und warum wir Eure Hilfe brauchen.""Wir wollen die Wildnis auf einer authentischen und nachhaltigen Art und Weise zurück in unsere Gärten bringen, indem wir wieder eine Verbindung mit der Natur durch eine besondere Auswahl an Wildpflanzen herstellen.""
Es gibt Hunderte von wunderbaren einheimischen Pflanzen die um uns herum in der Natur wachsen und wir wollen mehr Saatgutboxen mit Samenmischungen für verschiedene Regionen, Böden und Lichtverhältnisse herstellen.
Wir müssen die Samen im Voraus vorbestellen, da die meisten Pflanzen auf Anfrage gezüchtet werden und wir ihre Verfügbarkeit sichern wollen. Immerhin sind Samen keine unbegrenzte Ressource.
Hilf uns dabei das europäische Bio-Label zu erhalten! Obwohl wir bereits Bio-Samen kaufen, müssen wir, um das europäische Bio-Label zu verwenden, zertifiziert werden.
Von jeder verkauften Saatgutbox wollen wir einen Betrag an die BGCI spenden - das bedeutet, dass wir noch ca. 2000 Boxen verkaufen müssen, um unseren ersten Nachhaltigkeits-Meilenstein zu erreichen - eine Saatgut-Expedition zu sponsern!
Wir wollen unsere Produkte auf Messen und Ausstellungen präsentieren, die leider mit hohen Einrichtungskosten verbunden sind.
Wir wollen die Verpackung unserer Produkte anpassen und optimieren, um den Verpackungsabfall zu minimieren. Dies ist nur möglich und erschwinglich, wenn wir in größeren Mengen bestellen.​

A1 Wall Calendar 2018.
One would think we are old-fashioned in today’s digital world by offering a wall calendar. But how often are you on your phone in the office and need a quick overview of all your appointments at one glance? Furthermore, we haven’t actually seen a wall calendar that makes an office space a little greener: so we created one! We want this to be a true international and multi-cultural calendar – suitable for everyone in the world. That’s why we haven’t included any bank holidays. The calendar is in English and shows the work weeks. The calendar is A1 sized and printed on 170g/m2 recycled and Blue Angel labelled paper.
A1 Wandkalender 2018.
Man würde denken, dass wir in der heutigen digitalen Welt altmodisch sind, indem wir einen Wandkalender anbieten. Aber wie oft ist man im Büro am Telefon und braucht einen schnellen Überblick über alle Termine? Ausserdem haben wir noch keinen Wandkalender gesehen, der eine Bürofläche etwas grüner macht - deswegen haben wir einen entworfen! Wir wollen, dass dies ein echter internationaler und multikultureller Kalender ist - der für jeden auf der Welt geeignet ist. Deshalb werden keine Feiertage angezeigt. Der Kalender ist auf Englisch und bildet die Arbeitswochen ab. Der Kalender ist auf 170g/m2 recyceltem Blauer Engel Papier gedruckt.

Our History. 
With a particular affinity for forests and wild spaces, we started the Blog “WALD & Co” (Wald meaning forest in German) a few years ago. Blogging with the philosophy “take a little piece of forest home” we write about harvesting plants and fruits from the forest and share recipes. After visiting several public and private gardens and parks, we noticed that strangely most gardens bear little resemblance to nature.It was then a natural progression to create the seed box FOREST TREASURES, which takes our philosophy literally by taking a piece of forest home. Our first seed collection box contains, according to us, the real treasures of our forests: woodruff, wild strawberries and wild garlic. The plants and fruits not only look pretty, but they can also be used in various recipes and have traditional medicinal values. We looked around us and got inspired by nature to curate this special seed collection with plants that grow naturally within close vicinity.""We strongly believe that nature has a positive balancing impact upon us"".  Unsere Geschichte. Mit einer besonderen Affinität zu Wäldern und der Natur haben wir vor einigen Jahren den Blog ""Wald & Co” begonnen. Auf dem Blog mit der Philosophie ""hol dir ein kleines Stückchen Wald nach Hause "" schreiben wir u.a. über die Ernte von Pflanzen und Früchten aus dem Wald und teilen Rezepte. Nach dem Besuch von mehreren öffentlichen und privaten Gärten und Parks, bemerkten wir, dass die meisten Gärten wenig Ähnlichkeit mit der Natur haben.Es war dann für uns selbstverständlich die Samenbox WALDSCHÄTZE zu kreieren, die unsere Philosophie buchstäblich übernimmt: hol dir ein Stückchen Wald nach Hause. Unsere erste Saatgut-Box enthält für uns die wahren Schätze unserer Wälder: Waldmeister, wilde Erdbeeren und Bärlauch. Die Pflanzen und Früchte sehen nicht nur schön aus, sondern können auch in verschiedenen Rezepten verwendet werden und haben traditionelle Heilwerte. Wir sahen uns um und wurden von der Natur inspiriert um diese spezielle Saatgutmischung zu entwickeln.""Wir glauben fest daran, dass die Natur einen positiven Einfluss auf uns hat.""

Our Seeds.
We completely avoid collecting seeds from plants growing in the wild as it can severely deplete the natural seed bank. Our seeds come from well-established and respectable seed suppliers where wild flowers are cultivated for seed collection purposes. We want to become fully organic where possible.
Unser Saatgut.
Wir vermeiden das Sammeln von Samen von Pflanzen, die in der Wildnis wachsen, da sich sonst die natürliche Samenbank stark abbauen würde. Unser Saatgut kommt von etablierten und respektablen Saatgutlieferanten, die wilde Blumen für die Saatguternte anbauen. Wir wollen möglichst biologisch-zertifizierte Samen verwenden.


Risks and Challenges.WALD & Co is just at the beginning of creating a range of seed collections and products. There is always an issue with the availability of seeds. They are not an endless resource.  The WALD & Co collection among a multitude of growers remains a challenge, however, we anticipate that we will be able to collect and process enough seeds to meet all the pledged products. Risiken und Herausforderungen.Wald & Co ist gerade am Anfang eine Reihe von Saatgutmischungen und Produkte zu entwerfen. Es gibt immer Herausforderungen mit der Verfügbarkeit der Samen. Sie sind keine endlose Ressource. Die Wald & Co-Kollektion unter einer Vielzahl von Lieferanten bleibt eine Herausforderung, aber wir gehen davon aus, dass wir in der Lage sein werden, genügend Samen zu erhalten und zu verarbeiten, um alle versprochenen Produkte liefern zu können.

About us.


Sonja Kalkschmidt grew up in the country side and comes from a family with a farming history. She started her career at the age of 12 by building several tree houses. Following her passions, she became an architect with a particular interest in green roofing and integrating vertical plants internally and externally.
Sonja worked around the globe on some of the largest projects in the world, managing contractors and consultants for external works and internal planting schemes. Later on she worked for a company that develops, constructs and manages tourist destinations worldwide.
Leaving the cooperate world behind, Sonja moved back to the German country side living right in the heart of three wonderful natural landscapes: the Black Forest, the Swabian Alps and Lake Constance. Here she explores her surroundings and the beauty of nature to observe, investigate and curate natural plant compositions for you to enjoy. Inspired by nature.

<h3>Our Purpose</h3>
<p>To provide unique products designed to automatically deliver useful items to users without transferring germs from one human to another. Serve Clean created the exciting Smart Toothpick Dispenser allowing unwrapped toothpicks to be dispensed without the user touching anything other than the delivered toothpick. This not only saves money, avoiding the cost of wrapped toothpicks, but it also saves the environment from pesky paper or cello wrappers finding their way onto the ground or into the landfills.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Seek</h3>
<p>We need your contribution and, as importantly, your help in getting the word out to your friends about our exciting new product. Your word of mouth and social media are the most helpful means of reaching our goal. With your contribution, we will complete the multi cavity Touch Free tong tool required to pack production for shipment. Your Dispenser will be ready, and in your hands, before Christmas 2016.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is estimated that over 7 million toothpick wrappers make their way, annually, onto city streets or landfills. Clearly the amount reaching a proper recycling center is minimal. In addition to this great product preventing germ transfer between humans and being ""just plain fun"", it serves to maintain a cleaner environment.</p>

<p>Currently I am running Sole Stacks out of my 600 sqft. apartment. My apartment has become the HQ and warehouse for Sole Stacks. But the strong passion I have in my product, I made it happen with what I have. Every year Sole Stacks has accomplished more than I imagined. Being able to ship internationally was one of them. Last year we shipped our first orders to Canada, and more countries added to the list after that. We plan to grow rapidly across the entire world. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>We need your help to get our warehouse open and running with the equipment &amp; machine that's going to be required to make our products. With your backing we will be able to acquire the CNC Machine, Warehouse, and tooling equipment to reach the production capacity necessary to make this a sustainable business.</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<p>For the past couple of years we have outsourced our manufacturing to local companies in Dallas, Tx. The manufacturing of Sole Stacks has always been done by a 3rd party company, and we think that it would be best if we manufactured it ourselves. The number one reason? Cost. Having our product made by someone else is not cost effective for us or our customers.  By taking on the responsibility of owning our own manufacturing shop with a CNC router we won't take on the burden of having to pay someone else to produce our product. Also, there are times when the machines goes down, or our 3rd party company gets really busy with other jobs. Which then delays getting the product in our hands to deliver to our customers. We want to get rid of all of these issues so our customers have the best experience. </p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
<p>Sole Stacks is the brainchild of Demont Campbell, a Texas Tech alumni, whose degree is in architecture. “I found myself at Gensler, one of the world's top architecture firms, yet I wanted to take my passion for design and combine it with my love for footwear,” says Campbell. </p>
<p>As an entrepreneur from the age of 16, Campbell learned quickly that it is the customer experience that was crucial to the business process. The pillars of his first company - honesty, trustworthiness and marketable product, live on today with Sole Stacks. Campbell created Sole Stacks to be customer-centric. After Sole Stacks began to increase traction, Campbell noticed trend in consumers getting to the point of purchase but not executing. The pain point seemed to be shipping. That is when Campbell noticed an opportunity to lower costs without sacrificing quality. “I couldn’t do much about the cost of shipping, but I could control the cost of my product. That's what led me into investigating becoming the manufacturer,” states Campbell.</p>

Currently there are 2 left at their facility. But they receive more every 2 weeks. We are in constant communication with a sales rep there to see what the inventory levels are there. We don't see this being a huge problem as we have factored in 3 weeks lead time to process all orders just in case.

About Me
Sole Stacks is the brainchild of Demont Campbell, a Texas Tech alumni, whose degree is in architecture. “I found myself at Gensler, one of the world's top architecture firms, yet I wanted to take my passion for design and combine it with my love for footwear,” says Campbell. 
As an entrepreneur from the age of 16, Campbell learned quickly that it is the customer experience that was crucial to the business process. The pillars of his first company - honesty, trustworthiness and marketable product, live on today with Sole Stacks. Campbell created Sole Stacks to be customer-centric. After Sole Stacks began to increase traction, Campbell noticed trend in consumers getting to the point of purchase but not executing. The pain point seemed to be shipping. That is when Campbell noticed an opportunity to lower costs without sacrificing quality. “I couldn’t do much about the cost of shipping, but I could control the cost of my product. That's what led me into investigating becoming the manufacturer,” states Campbell.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

Nevertheless, we have gone a long way to develop a fully functional prototype, and being a multidisciplinary team, we are confident we can make it through the next steps!</p><div style=""text-align: center;margin-top:45px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.planthive.com/indiegogo/sections/ph_timeline_v2.png"" src="""" style=""display: inline-block;border-radius:8px;""/></div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h3><div style=""height:10px;""> </div><p style=""text-align:center;"">We want to give people a new experience: “discovering how life can grow from a seed to a fully-fledged crop, ready to be harvested and enjoyed”</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">It all started when we decided to try and grow strawberries in our living room in the middle of winter. Being inspired by the MIT concept of a ""personal food computer"" for growing plants indoors, we decided to make our own version with the DIY hacking equipment that was available. We imagined a computer that grows plants naturally and faster, with no pesticides.</p><p style=""text-align:center;"">So, in January 2016, we started building a rough prototype. Our first step was building our LED lights. We tried a lot of different configurations until deciding that our first version will be PAR optimized and dimmable. At the same time, we started building DIY structures to host our lighting and climate sensing system. Our prototypes were ugly, impractical - clearly, a prototype - but plants were growing from 30% to 50% faster than under ordinary sunlight!</p><div style=""padding:30px;width:100%;text-align:center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.planthive.com/indiegogo/showcases/story1.png"" src="""" style=""width:50%;""/></div><p style=""text-align:center;"">While we were working on our electronic system, we begun re-prototyping our mechanical structure. We made efforts to curate the design with every iteration. Once we were pleased with our design, we went on with building a look-alike prototype out of laser cut wood.</p><div style=""padding:30px;width:100%;text-align:center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.planthive.com/indiegogo/showcases/story2.png"" src="""" style=""width:50%;""/></div><p style=""text-align:center;"">When we felt comfortable enough with our prototypes, we decided it was time our look-alike mechanical structure and electronic system came together. Squeezing the cables of our DIY electronic system inside the narrow enclosures of our laser cut structure resulted in many sleepless nights. But we were satisfied with the result as it allowed us to take some pictures for our website and start building our brand.</p><div style=""padding:30px;width:100%;text-align:center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.planthive.com/indiegogo/showcases/story3.png"" src="""" style=""width:50%;""/></div><p style=""text-align:center;"">Our pre-industrial version of our smart garden also proved its worth in terms of product development. We presented it to the Belgian leading research center Sirris, and asked for cooperation on a feasibility study. In February 2017, Sirris came back with good news: the PlantHive could be done, on the condition of doing certain design changes.</p><div style=""padding:30px;width:100%;text-align:center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.planthive.com/indiegogo/showcases/story4.png"" src="""" style=""width:50%;""/></div><p style=""text-align:center;"">We put the newly gained knowledge to test quickly. Our electronics had to go one more iteration to become CE and RoHS compliant. This proved to be a perfect opportunity to also iterate on our hardware’s functionality. It was time to re-design our LED and Raspberry shield PCBs. We are very proud to have our own electronic components!</p><div style=""padding:30px;width:100%;text-align:center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.planthive.com/indiegogo/showcases/story5.png"" src="""" style=""width:50%;""/></div><p style=""text-align:center;"">The first Version 1.0 of the Planthive was born in April 2017, thanks to 3D printing technology. It took us a long time to crack how we were going to put together such a big structure of separated 3D printed pieces, but the first results were quite promising. Our feasibility study also provided us with great insights on how to approach different hardware production scales.</p><div style=""padding:30px;width:100%;text-align:center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.planthive.com/indiegogo/showcases/story6.png"" src="""" style=""width:50%;""/></div><p style=""text-align:center;"">In summer 2017, we decided it was time to put our concept to the test in the hands of actual users, which proved to be a very useful step. Handcrafting our first batch highlighted the aspects that could be problematic in a larger-scale production. The PlantHives proved to be quite successful gardening units as you can see!</p><div style=""padding:30px;width:100%;text-align:center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.planthive.com/indiegogo/showcases/story7.png"" src="""" style=""width:50%;""/></div><p style=""text-align:center;"">We are currently working on our supply chain and electronic component sourcing strategy.

<p>Obviously, in hardware development, anything can go wrong. But we have worked hard to minimize risks, so here are our thoughts:</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> no component is unique, we always have an alternative source, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>Embedded computer:</strong> so far, the Raspberry Pi seems like a safe choice. But we are already examining the possibility of using another single-board computer.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> we develop in-house and don't depend on externals, which is safer.</p>
<p><strong>Certification:</strong> when we worked with Sirris, we asked for help in designing the PlantHive to be easily CE and UL certified. Work still remains to be done, but since inception we made choices that will help us satisfy both labels.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing:</strong> we are 3D-printing the PlantHive at the moment. We plan to go to intermediate or full-fledged production tooling when this campaign concludes. We are new to manufacturing, but we have an industrial partner that masters this domain very well (they manufacture and sell many consumer electronics products and have at least a decade of experience).</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual property:</strong> we have protected our designs and trademarks, and are preparing the worldwide patenting effort for our PlantHive.</p>
<p>Reducing all risks? Yes we can! The more funds we raise through this campaign, the lower our risks as we will spend every extra money on improving, accelerating and strengthening our PlantHive project.</p>

Long InterviewOur timeline and future stepsIndustrializing a hardware product comes with a lots of risks. Nevertheless, we have gone a long way to develop a fully functional prototype, and being a multidisciplinary team, we are confident we can make it through the next steps!Our Story We want to give people a new experience: “discovering how life can grow from a seed to a fully-fledged crop, ready to be harvested and enjoyed”It all started when we decided to try and grow strawberries in our living room in the middle of winter. Being inspired by the MIT concept of a ""personal food computer"" for growing plants indoors, we decided to make our own version with the DIY hacking equipment that was available. We imagined a computer that grows plants naturally and faster, with no pesticides.So, in January 2016, we started building a rough prototype. Our first step was building our LED lights. We tried a lot of different configurations until deciding that our first version will be PAR optimized and dimmable. At the same time, we started building DIY structures to host our lighting and climate sensing system. Our prototypes were ugly, impractical - clearly, a prototype - but plants were growing from 30% to 50% faster than under ordinary sunlight!While we were working on our electronic system, we begun re-prototyping our mechanical structure. We made efforts to curate the design with every iteration. Once we were pleased with our design, we went on with building a look-alike prototype out of laser cut wood.When we felt comfortable enough with our prototypes, we decided it was time our look-alike mechanical structure and electronic system came together. Squeezing the cables of our DIY electronic system inside the narrow enclosures of our laser cut structure resulted in many sleepless nights. But we were satisfied with the result as it allowed us to take some pictures for our website and start building our brand.Our pre-industrial version of our smart garden also proved its worth in terms of product development. We presented it to the Belgian leading research center Sirris, and asked for cooperation on a feasibility study. In February 2017, Sirris came back with good news: the PlantHive could be done, on the condition of doing certain design changes.We put the newly gained knowledge to test quickly. Our electronics had to go one more iteration to become CE and RoHS compliant. This proved to be a perfect opportunity to also iterate on our hardware’s functionality. It was time to re-design our LED and Raspberry shield PCBs. We are very proud to have our own electronic components!The first Version 1.0 of the Planthive was born in April 2017, thanks to 3D printing technology. It took us a long time to crack how we were going to put together such a big structure of separated 3D printed pieces, but the first results were quite promising. Our feasibility study also provided us with great insights on how to approach different hardware production scales.In summer 2017, we decided it was time to put our concept to the test in the hands of actual users, which proved to be a very useful step. Handcrafting our first batch highlighted the aspects that could be problematic in a larger-scale production. The PlantHives proved to be quite successful gardening units as you can see!We are currently working on our supply chain and electronic component sourcing strategy. We are planning to start manufacturing activities in summer 2018. Our BETA and GAMMA testers will pilot test along with us the model that is to be shipped in February 2019.How will funds be used
The PlantHive smart garden is already being tested by 10 hand-picked alpha users! In order to deliver you with the best possible quality product, before building our next batch, we wish to iterate on our smart garden’s functionality based our alpha testers’ feedback. The funds collected throughout this campaign will exclusively be dedicated to product development, certifications, (molds, etc.), and of course, building your PlantHive smart garden.

F.A.Q.  What does the PlantHive smart garden include? PlantHive comes equipped with 110W dimable PAR optimized grow-lights, a high performance ventilation system, as well as a temperature and humidity sensor. You can increase your PlantHive's capabilities by adding climate control modules.  Can I control it remotely? As long as the Internet connection at home is stable, you can control your smart garden from any PC, tablet or smartphone.  What can I grow with PlantHive? From aromatic herbs and leafy greens, to bigger fruiting plants, you can plant anything that does not outgrow your PlantHive!  What will my plants yield in the PlantHive? Depending on what you are growing and whether you are using a hydroponic or soil growth medium, your plants will yield twice as much as they would in their natural environment.  How long until my plants are ready for consumption? This depends on the species you are growing. Aromatic herbs and leafy greens will start yielding four weeks after you plant them, whereas it takes two to four months for fruiting plants. Keep in mind that you cannot go faster than that!  How much electricity does my smart garden consume? The PlantHive smart garden consumes approximately the same amount of electricity as a small laptop.  How much noise does the PlantHive generate? The fans included in the PlantHive generate around 40Db of noise.  I don't like the magenta color of the lights! Can I change that? You can switch to a pure white light by turning off the blue and red LED circuits of your PlantHive. Keep in mind though that it is not the most efficient spectrum for plant-growth.  How do I increase the size of my PlantHive? Simply by adding an extra set of columns!  How can I further customize my smart garden?  You can add humidity and temperature control modules for better climate conditions control inside your PlantHive's growth-chamber. You can also add a wide array of sensors for higher precision on environmental data. Finally, you can add the Hive vision cameras for remote sensing and AI assisted plant health analysis.  What will the funds be used for? Industrializing a hardware product comes with many risks. We already have gone a long way to develop a fully functional prototype, and being a multidisciplinary team, we are confident we can crack it!- Start component sourcing operations- Organize manufacturing and logistics for worldwide delivery.We have also started the CE labeling processes and will also certify our PlantHive for UL. We have prepared the worldwide patent filing and are protecting our trademarks.  What are the risks of this project? 
Obviously, in hardware development, anything can go wrong. But we have worked hard to minimize risks, so here are our thoughts:
Components: no component is unique, we always have an alternative source, just in case.
Embedded computer: so far, the Raspberry Pi seems like a safe choice. But we are already examining the possibility of using another single-board computer.
Software: we develop in-house and don't depend on externals, which is safer.
Certification: when we worked with Sirris, we asked for help in designing the PlantHive to be easily CE and UL certified. Work still remains to be done, but since inception we made choices that will help us satisfy both labels.
Manufacturing: we are 3D-printing the PlantHive at the moment. We plan to go to intermediate or full-fledged production tooling when this campaign concludes. We are new to manufacturing, but we have an industrial partner that masters this domain very well (they manufacture and sell many consumer electronics products and have at least a decade of experience).
Intellectual property: we have protected our designs and trademarks, and are preparing the worldwide patenting effort for our PlantHive.
Reducing all risks? Yes we can! The more funds we raise through this campaign, the lower our risks as we will spend every extra money on improving, accelerating and strengthening our PlantHive project.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Hello! Our names are Kara and Mackenzie Sato. We live in Michigan with our cats, chickens, and fish. Mackenzie is an elementary music teacher, and Kara owns Vertex Coffee Roasters.  We have a passion for living zero-waste/sustainable lives, sharing space with friends and family, and singing everything that we're doing--constantly. We have been ""practice homesteading"" in our backyard under the name ""Luminosity Farms"" for just over a year. We have dreamed of starting a bigger homestead together and have the incredible chance to create one!</p>
<p>An unexpected opportunity arose to purchase a parcel of land that would allow us construct a passive house (a house that heats and cools itself), grow/raise our food, and help further connect us to the lifestyle that we have been striving to live.  We would love to take advantage of this opportunity, but we know that it will require support from our friends and family. We are hoping that you may be willing to help us out by contributing to our campaign. Thank you so much for your consideration.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise $5,000, but if we were to raise more or less than that we would be incredibly excited. The money would go to securing the land and funding materials for the house construction.</p>
<p>If you can donate money, we want to make sure that you know how much we appreciate it! We want to offer thank-you's that reflect our passion for recycling,  gardening, local business, and being genuine with our appreciation. We've got four items that build upon one another as the donation increases, and they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A handcrafted thank-you letter made from our homemade, recycled paper. Kara and Mackenzie source, blend, and dry the materials to make the paper that will be the base of a personalized letter of appreciation.</li>
<li>A seed variety pack that will contain seeds from our very garden. You will receive a variety of seeds, including herbs and vegetables.</li>
<li>For our local donors, a set of 8 plant starts that include a variety of herbs and vegetables. They will all be delivered to your house! For this, we ask that you live within 25 miles of Milan, MI. For our friends who are a little farther away, (or for those of your who just love starting seeds!) we will expand the seed variety pack to include up to 20 varieties of vegetables, herbs, and flowers that you can choose!</li>
<li>A ""Luminosity Farms"" t-shirt with our logo on it. We work with a local company to get quality creations!</li>
<li>For our local donors, a CSA-style food delivery is the top perk! Not only do you receive all the perks above, but we will also deliver you a box of in-season crops that were grown in our very own backyard! We will deliver 4 boxes, on 4 weeks of your choosing. For this, you will need to live within 25 miles of Milan, MI. For those who are a little farther away, we will send you 4  bags of coffee from our coffee shop whenever you would like them!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ultimately, we want to try and live a more sustainable life, and share the experience to try and inspire more people to take steps in living a life that is differently satisfying than the one they may be currently living. We know that in order to reach that goal, we need to lean on the community for financial support. We are hoping that this feels like a worthwhile cause, and you will support our endeavor.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Also, we see the times that we're in. We are trying to bring some certainty to our lives, but we recognize that may bring some uncertainty to your life. If you are not in a position to donate money right now, we would love for you to just send us an encouraging letter. We want to bury them underneath our house and literally have a house build on a foundation of love. Many people have helped us become the people that we are, and we want to take their spirit and love into the next phase of our life. </p>
<p>If you can spread the word and spread the love, we will be forever grateful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lots of love,</p>

The criteria our software uses is based on how you would dress/act according to the weather e.g. you would probably act similarly to 'thunderstorm’ and ‘rain’, likewise with ‘sunny’ and ‘partly sunny’. Here is a key of how we’ve grouped the different weather types.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551752294/rm6btxj4ejoxnlfgsziv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>If you live in a very hot house</strong></p><p>Past 29C/84F, the smart ink will start activating on its own. The average room temperature in Australia, Canada, America and the UK is most often cited between 18C/64F - 21C/70F. The World Health Organization recommends home temperatures to be 18C/64F for healthy adults. If your house does reach 29C/84F, it just means all of the icons will start activating and you’ll have to wait for the house to cool down before checking the weather. It doesn't damage the poster.</p><p>If your house is consistently 29C/84F and over, we wouldn't recommend purchasing the poster.</p><p><strong>Where did the idea come from? </strong></p><p>The original idea of an updating weather poster came at my parents house, in the UK. We were all in the kitchen, chatting and enjoying each other's company when the topic of ‘the weather’ came up. Seconds later, we were all on our phones, and the moment had gone.

As the weather forecast changes, so will the ink on the paper. The icons take 5-15 minutes to fully activate and will update throughout the day as needed.How it fits into your lifeCheck the weather with a glance before you leave the house.Screen-free your morning.Un-intrusive tech which won’t compete for your attention. Who is Typified?Typified is a small team who develop internet-connected products alongside a host of collaborators. We aim to release products which don’t ask anything of you to do their job, but help you in your day to day life. These products will be less intrusive ways of expressing the internet and have strong Art and Design influences.We’ve spent the last 18 months figuring out how a paper poster, printed with smart ink could be controlled by a tiny internet connected computer. Our first product which uses this technology is the updating Weather Poster. Why paper and smart ink? We live in an incredible age of connected information but the ways that it integrates into our lives is often intrusive and overly demanding. Screens ensnare our attention and then usually keep it for much longer than we feel good about. Because the Weather Poster is literally a printed poster without any light emitting elements, you don't have the nagging sensation to look at it like you would a phone or TV screen. We also think of the Poster as equal parts Art and Technology, it has rich colours and tiny imperfections from the screen printing process as well as exclusivity as each design is limited to a run of 500. This sits in stark contrast to screens which are produced in the millions of units.Why just the Weather? We think there is a place for less attention demanding products which just take care of one important task in an ultra convenient way, whilst also adding to the look and feel of your home or workplace.How do I use it? Once you’ve plugged in the poster and connected it to your Wifi, it will never ask for more than a glance from you to do it’s job. Simply, by hanging it up in your house or office it will naturally catch your eye as you move through your day. How can ink on paper change? Smart ink is any ink that’s been engineered at a chemical level to change colour in response to a certain stimulus. Our new technology allows the tiny computer to interface with the smart ink. We don’t think the internet has ever been expressed through paper and ink in this way.What you get with the Typified Weather Poster:What weather can it display?The poster shows the weather at 8am, 12pm, 4pm and 8pm. It only shows 1 day's weather forecast at a time, so if it’s 4pm and the poster displays 8am sunny, this is information about the morning you’ve already had. The different weather types are grouped into 1 of 3 symbols; rainy, cloudy or sunny. The criteria our software uses is based on how you would dress/act according to the weather e.g. you would probably act similarly to 'thunderstorm’ and ‘rain’, likewise with ‘sunny’ and ‘partly sunny’. Here is a key of how we’ve grouped the different weather types.If you live in a very hot housePast 29C/84F, the smart ink will start activating on its own. The average room temperature in Australia, Canada, America and the UK is most often cited between 18C/64F - 21C/70F. The World Health Organization recommends home temperatures to be 18C/64F for healthy adults. If your house does reach 29C/84F, it just means all of the icons will start activating and you’ll have to wait for the house to cool down before checking the weather. It doesn't damage the poster.If your house is consistently 29C/84F and over, we wouldn't recommend purchasing the poster.Where did the idea come from? The original idea of an updating weather poster came at my parents house, in the UK. We were all in the kitchen, chatting and enjoying each other's company when the topic of ‘the weather’ came up. Seconds later, we were all on our phones, and the moment had gone. It had been replaced with us all concentrating on our little screens, our attention had shifted from the real word to our screens and then stayed there. The walls seemed the most accessible place to keep this ever-changing stream of information. But, from something less intrusive and stimulating than a screen. A nicely printed poster or a piece of art which could change and update seemed like a good alternative.Product development process We worked for about 18 months on figuring out how the poster would work; iterating through the electronic, software, industrial and graphic design as well as figuring out how to actually print the smart ink (it’s particle size is about 10x bigger than that of standard ink).

  Dullo Pillow is different than the average pillows you see on the market today. Designed to gently cradle and support both your head and neck, our pillow will provide you with quality sleep that you have never experienced before. The center crater helps to distribute the weight throughout your head during any sleeping position throughout the night so that you can get a good night’s rest.    The center crater helps to distribute the weight throughout your head during any sleeping position throughout the night so that you can get a good night’s rest.  Other pillows allow for too much movement throughout the night which ends up interfering with the quality of sleep. The center crater in Dullo Pillow gently supports your head from all angles so that you can maintain a comfortable position all throughout the night.     Other pillows creates a space between the pillow and the neck.  Dullo pillow perfectly molds to your neck to provide complete support.  Dullo Pillow contains two support tubes that work to prevent the microfiber filling from shifting too much while simultaneously providing cushioned support for the neck. The tubes have been designed to perfectly mold to your neck so that it maintains its natural C-curve shape so that you can sleep deeply throughout the night. Even though everyone has different neck lengths, there has yet been a pillow that has taken this into consideration. Dullo Pillow, however, has been designed to provide maximum comfort and quality sleep for different neck lengths. Dullo Pillow adjusts your body position so that the spine aligns horizontally with the head and neck.    Silicone-coated microfibers are elastic and resilient, so pillows with this filling are not easily deformed. Dullo Pillow's coated fiber filler absorbs micro shocks from your neck and shoulders and allows you to sleep comfortably.Unlike ordinary cotton, Dullo Pillow's coated fiber filler is highly water-resistant and breathable which allows for humidity/temperature control for a good night's sleep.   Thin microfiber : If the fiber is thin then you can fit more inside the pillow.Short fiber : If the length of the fiber is short then it won't tangle during a wash.Coated : Silicone coating makes it water-repellent   No one is fond of night sweats. After receiving tons of feedback on what people would like in their pillows, we discovered that people wanted a pillow that would help prevent night sweats. Our team took that idea to heart and created a design that would allow for maximum ventilation so that people can stay cool throughout the night. Through the crown side hole and gap between the two detachable sides, airflow goes through both sides and circulates around the head so that you can stay as cool as possible while you're sleeping with Dullo pillow.    Other pillows do not allow you to get good sleep because they don’t provide a sufficient amount of support for the neck. Dullo Pillow is designed to evenly distribute the weight throughout your head and neck so that you can sleep well in the proper position.     Dullo Pillow delivers the best sleeping posture known to help people who suffer from insomnia, anxiety, stress and back/neck pain while sleeping.  

Dullo Interview - DR. BRANDON VAN SETERS / Gravity Spinal Chiropractic, California
           Zipper located on either sides of allows you to adjust the height of the pillow. If Dullo Pillow is too high for you then simply unzip and remove one side.  The space in between the top and bottom pillow can be used as arm holes for those who want to use Dullo Pillow on a desk at home or at the office. You can also use it as a cushion or backrest by unzipping one side and mounting it on the chair.  The front and back sides have separate designs that provide the best sleep for different type of sleeping positions.  The detachable function and silicone-coated fiber makes Dullo Pillow easy to machine wash and dry.  Dullo pillow is washable in its entirety so that you can always keep it sanitized and fresh. Please use a laundry net when washing and drying.

We listened to their concerns, work-arounds, and stories about lighting during night flight. Some pilots were using things like hair ties or tape to hold lights onto their hands and one pilot even told us, “I have to put the velcro so tight, to keep it from falling off, that by the end of the flight my finger is purple.” During this needfinding process we found that the three most important principles for Army pilots are safety, reliability and ease of use. In the below sections we explain how we designed to meet these principles. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">
</p>
<p>Pilots have enough to worry about when flying an aircraft and need their equipment to be reliable so it will not add to their list of concerns. This is why we are using quality components to ensure that the Nimbus Light won’t break under normal circumstances. The electronics in our device are incorporated into a flexible circuit which will not break if thrown in the bottom of a flight bag and will not wear out due to dust or grime. Quality components and software design ensure that it won’t run out of battery from being left on when not in use.</p>

<p>

</div></div>","The Nimbus Light is a task lighting solution designed to keep army pilots safe.
The Nimbus Light allows pilots to switch on, illuminate, and complete a task all with one hand. Our wearable Night Vision goggle compatible light is non-intrusive, low maintenance, reliable, and effortless to use.
Our Mission
Our number one goal is to keep our service men and women safe. We believe it is ridiculous that Army Pilots are sometimes put in dangerous situations because of equipment failure. At ODECI Inc. We want our equipment to be as badass as our pilots.
The DesignThe Nimbus Light was designed based on the needs and desires of real Army Blackhawk Pilots, and it fits under all Army equipment regulations. Current products are clunky, obtrusive, and often times require pilots to use two hands to complete any tasks.
We spent countless hours talking to pilots before we began our design. We listened to their concerns, work-arounds, and stories about lighting during night flight. Some pilots were using things like hair ties or tape to hold lights onto their hands and one pilot even told us, “I have to put the velcro so tight, to keep it from falling off, that by the end of the flight my finger is purple.” During this needfinding process we found that the three most important principles for Army pilots are safety, reliability and ease of use. In the below sections we explain how we designed to meet these principles. 


Safety


From fire to water to dirt, we want military pilots to be able to trust the Nimbus Light. So we have ensured the materials meet all regulatory standards. Additionally, the Nimbus Light does not interfere with current night vision goggles. 




Reliability



Pilots have enough to worry about when flying an aircraft and need their equipment to be reliable so it will not add to their list of concerns. This is why we are using quality components to ensure that the Nimbus Light won’t break under normal circumstances. The electronics in our device are incorporated into a flexible circuit which will not break if thrown in the bottom of a flight bag and will not wear out due to dust or grime. Quality components and software design ensure that it won’t run out of battery from being left on when not in use.



Ease of Use




Current supplemental lighting products require pilots to use both hands. We wanted to remove this barrier. The palm light  allows pilots to write and illuminate an area with one hand. This light is also perfectly aimed for picking things up or pinching a knob or lever. We have also designed the device for our users to only have to put it on once, and then it becomes an extension of their gloves. 





Quality Components
We ensured that our product was built to last. Our components fit under all regulations, and the NIMBUS Light is designed to be comfortable and organic. Once the pilot puts it on, it feels like a natural extension of the hand.
Perks

We have been hard at work, but without your help none of this would be possible, so here are the different ways we want to reward you!

</div> <p>There are currently many companies who are building the lights which are controlled by smartphone apps. But there is one thing they do not provide, <b>portability</b>. They all need some kind of mounts or holders plus a central hub to connect your phone with light.</p>
<p>So we created roshni; a smartphone controlled light that is rechargeable and small enough to be carried anywhere you like.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Roshni has Bluetooth 4.0 (Bluetooth Low Energy) in it. It connect to any device which supports BLE.</p>

<div>In design, its not like other bulbs or lights in your house. It is semi-spherical in shape and its body is made up of translucent white plastic. It is designed in a way to emit light all around so it looks the same from any angle.</div>
<div>Light it emits is not very sharp but smooth. Which makes it even more beautiful when calm colors are used. </div>
<div>Using roshni is pretty simple. We love Apple (like everyone else) so we wanted to keep the same design philosophy of 'minimalism'.</div>
<div>We did not add any physical button on the device. Instead, it responds to taps. Tap it twice to turn it on and vice versa. All other operations can be performed with our <b>powerful </b>free app.</div>

</div></div>","Roshni

Roshni is a noun in Urdu language which literally means Light.



 There are currently many companies who are building the lights which are controlled by smartphone apps. But there is one thing they do not provide, portability. They all need some kind of mounts or holders plus a central hub to connect your phone with light.
So we created roshni; a smartphone controlled light that is rechargeable and small enough to be carried anywhere you like.

Roshni has Bluetooth 4.0 (Bluetooth Low Energy) in it. It connect to any device which supports BLE.




 









In design, its not like other bulbs or lights in your house. It is semi-spherical in shape and its body is made up of translucent white plastic. It is designed in a way to emit light all around so it looks the same from any angle.
Light it emits is not very sharp but smooth. Which makes it even more beautiful when calm colors are used. 
Using roshni is pretty simple. We love Apple (like everyone else) so we wanted to keep the same design philosophy of 'minimalism'.
We did not add any physical button on the device. Instead, it responds to taps. Tap it twice to turn it on and vice versa. All other operations can be performed with our powerful free app.
 Charging:Roshni comes with a wireless charger. Just place roshni above it and it will start charging. We've equipped roshni with Qi wireless. Pick and go without any wires.







And now, let's introduce you to the roshni app. We'll be releasing app in 3 platforms initially. iOS, Android and Chrome (browser). For iOS and Android; app will run on all smartphone/tablets with iOS 7+ and Android 4.3+.




For Chrome, we'll release Chrome app that will run on OS X, Windows and Chrome OS as well. But Chrome app will only run if your Laptop/PC supports Bluetooth Low Energy. You can use a BLE adaptor (like this one) if your PC does not support BLE.
Connect roshni with app:
Its pretty simple. Double-tap roshni to turn on. Open app and connect.








Features:
App is packed with pretty amazing features.









Basic ones are to change the color of app.



App can even detect the dominant color from an image. e.g: If you want to change the light to according to an image. Or you can just pick a color from an image with app.


Alarm:
You can set a time for roshni to turn itself on with a color or mode. e.g: Set it to 6 AM with 'Sunrise' mode and it will wake itself up with a beautiful color.
Notifications:
App has an awesome feature in it. You can connect your social network with it and when an update happens, roshni will change its color to notify you.





Party Mode:
Turn on party mode in roshni app. Play some music on your device. See roshni go nuts.

  







Here are the components that Roshni is made of:





Here are the dimensions. Although, these are not final but these are the ones we have our hearts on:






The nitty gritty of it contains:
- A BLE (Bluetooth Smart) chip from Nordic Semiconductors.
- A 3.6v, 1350 mAh re-chargeable battery.
- A matrix of 24-bit (True Color) RGB LEDs
- A microprocessor.
- Qi wireless charging module












Oh, did we mention its waterproof and it is designed to float?




Use it at night or day. As a night light on your bedside table. Or in your living room. Beautify the scene with roshni in your patio. Change its brightness to your liking. Set any color. Use anywhere.




 



You might be wondering about the goal we've set. Yes, it is not enough to fund the purchase of electronics, molds & packaging. But instead, this goal represents the support & demand of community. It means if we reach our goal then people like you are in need of a product like this.

Once we reach our goal, i.e. the idea is validated, we would use money from campaign to refine the product on both hardware and software side.

We would not be able to go into production with this goal but we would make sure that all the perks we've promised get delivered to you. We've already contracted with a manufacturer in China that would produce Roshni in small batch, for all the backers who have chosen it as a perk.

We would like to keep transparency in what we have done and what we still find hard. It is the first time we have decided to create a product for public use. Means we had no experience on how & what kind of components we need for commercial products, what testings are needed etc. But we learned a lot in process of creating roshni and we won't stop at anything else. 
Challenges:

We have no experience in working with contractors, manufacturers, suppliers.
We have no experience in how things work when it comes to creating a commercial product that is going to be used by thousands.
We don't know how international shipping works. Custom clearance, different regulations on different material in different countries. There could be delays in shipping sometimes.
It is our first time using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). We have not working with this type of small data-rate before. We don't know if it would cause any problems in future.

How can we overcome the challenges.

We both have 3 years+ hands-on experience in our fields. Means, our team has both the hardware and software requirements.
Arduino and Google have been our friend through-out in project. The four of us have never spent a day without each other for past 18 months.
We'll use professional help whenever needed. We will not, ever, compromise on security of users so we will make sure everything we use is of best quality and certified to latest standards.
Aside from the online material and professional help, You are whom we are relying on most. We don't just need funds, we need a community that could help us in any step we find difficult.

So, we have turned it into reality for you!“What is that, then?” you will ask. Believe!Here you can see a unique item that combines toy, stool, stand, seat for a picnic and attractive décor. Despite the fact that ECOSTOOL was created for kids it can bear the adult weighing up to 150 kg. It is impressive, isn’t it?THERE IS MORE TO COME!We would like to draw your attention that ECOSTOOL is made of special wood fiber material with water-resistant coating. The advantages are evident:
The material is much lighter than wood. A kid can move the stool by himself without damaging the floor and with impunity;
The assembling requires several minutes. Being assembled ECOSTOOL takes up minimum place. It can be easily placed in the wardrobe or in the corner of the room;
There is no contamination unlike the plastic furniture. Of course, the material is eco-friendly and hypoallergenic;
Fair value (compared to similar wooden and plastic products).
  And the last, but not the least: just imagine how many forests can be saved if other producers switch to wood fiber even partially. Indeed, it is equal to wood in terms of quality and strength; however its consumption is one order less.ECOSTOOL is developed and manufactured by PlayToyz, the company that has been developing toys in Estonia since 2015. The goal of the project:It is very important for us that the product is distributed throughout the world actively and attracts customers that can see other perspectives. It is also very important for us to save the forests and the environment. Even now ECOSTOOL is completely developed, tested and ready for the mass production. We are sure that every one of you will see the true value of our job and efforts we put into the project. Moreover, if we succeed we will expand the product range. So, you will see a lot of ECO furniture for kids and adults soon.Who we are?Our company Vipline Ltd. has a 12 years’ experience in printing industry and production of illuminated signs, operating all over Europe since 2004.

<p>Aynı yolun yolcusuyuz.</p>
<p>Hayat ve hayatın evreleri bir tünele benziyor. Bizlerse bu tünelin içinde birbirimizin hayatına dokunarak ilerliyoruz. Hepimizin umuduysa tünelin sonunun aydınlığa çıktığı yerde güzel ve güneşli günler görebilmek; bizler bu yüzden gaz pedalına asıldıkça asılıyoruz. Uzlaşmacı ve çoğul fikir dünyasında, materyalizmden olabildiğince uzakta; her bireyin içindeki farklı kişilikleri gönül rahatlığıyla ortaya koyabilmesini amaçlıyoruz.</p>

<p></p>
<p>We are all on the same road.</p>
<p>Phases of life are like a tunnel. We are progressing in this tunnel, touching each other’s lives. We all hope to see beautiful, sunny days at the end of the tunnel; that is why we push harder and harder on the accelerator. We all hope that in the world of free ideas and compromise, as far from materialism as possible, all individuals will be able to show their true personalities.</p>

</div></div>","Kısa Özet/Short Summart Biz liseli ya da çiçeği burnunda mezun gençleriz. Ve biz edebiyata, sanata, okumaya, yazmaya ve düşünmeye dair her şeyi yaşamın en önemli parçası olarak görüyoruz. Bu yüzden bacak kadar boyumuza bakmadan boyumuzdan büyük işlere kalkışıyor, su yerine söze dahil olma savaşı veriyoruz. 
Kendi kendimize okuyup yazdıktan sonra bir yerlerde belki asla görmeyeceğimiz birinin ruhuna biraz olsun değmek ya da sadece elimizden geldiğince köşe yazarcılığı oynamak istiyoruz.


“Bu gençlik nereye gidiyor” sorusuna bir cevap olmak ümidiyle,
TÜNEL
<http://tunelgazete.com/>
--------------------------------
We are either high school students or have just graduated. We see literature, art and everything related to reading, writing and thinking as an integral part of life. Regardless of our young age, we are hoping and aiming to rise up to the challenge and take our part in the current intellectual conversation.
With the joy of excluding ourselves from the selfish aspect of art and with the motivation of reaching out to more people, we dive into a new adventure. After years of individual reading and writing, only sharing our work with others through means of classwork; we are now playing the ‘columnists’ to reach out to more people whom we may have never met or known.


Our hope is when someone asks where the youth is headed, the answer will be;TUNNEL
   Neden Tünel? / Why Tunnel?

Aynı yolun yolcusuyuz.
Hayat ve hayatın evreleri bir tünele benziyor. Bizlerse bu tünelin içinde birbirimizin hayatına dokunarak ilerliyoruz. Hepimizin umuduysa tünelin sonunun aydınlığa çıktığı yerde güzel ve güneşli günler görebilmek; bizler bu yüzden gaz pedalına asıldıkça asılıyoruz. Uzlaşmacı ve çoğul fikir dünyasında, materyalizmden olabildiğince uzakta; her bireyin içindeki farklı kişilikleri gönül rahatlığıyla ortaya koyabilmesini amaçlıyoruz.
---------------------------

We are all on the same road.
Phases of life are like a tunnel. We are progressing in this tunnel, touching each other’s lives. We all hope to see beautiful, sunny days at the end of the tunnel; that is why we push harder and harder on the accelerator. We all hope that in the world of free ideas and compromise, as far from materialism as possible, all individuals will be able to show their true personalities.


Bize Lazım Olan & Sizin Kazanacağınız / What We Need & What You Get Bir limitimiz olmamasına karşın, gelecek herhangi bir desteğe; maddi veya manevi, açığız. Bizim amacımız, kurduğumuz bu ilham verici topluluğu daha çok insana ulaştırmak, daha çok insana tünellerimizi uzatmak ve onların da sesini duymak. 
Bu kampanyadan gelecek para ile sitemizin reklamını yapıp, aynı zamanda özel sayı olarak birkaç sayı basıp kitapçılarda satmayı düşünüyoruz. Amacımız kar gütmek olmadığı için, herhangi bir yerden gelecek paranın tamamını yine Tünel Gazeteyi geliştirmek ve duyurmak için kullanacağımıza söz veriyoruz.
Eğer amacımıza erişemezsek, buradan gelen paranın yettiği kadarıyla sitemizi yayıp daha fazla insana ulaşıp hem daha çok okuyucu hem de daha çok yazar kazanmayı umuyoruz.
-------------------------------------
Even though we don't have a limit, we are open to all financial or spiritual support from everyone. Our aim is to dig up tunnels to even more people and make sure that their voices are heard as well and that they are a part of this inspiring community we have created.
With the money from this campaign, we will advertise our website and also print special editions of our columns to sell at local bookstores. Because we are non-profit, we promise you that any money that we raise will go to improving and advertising Tunnel Newspaper.
If we don't reach our goal here, we will still use all of the money we have raised to advertise our money to reach out to more people, so that we can gain more readers as well as more writers.

Bize yapacağınız herhangi bir bağış, 25 gencin hayallerini bir adım daha ileri taşımasına; edebiyatlarını, sanatlarını, müziklerini, karikatürlerini, kısacası her türlü seslerini dünyaya duyurmalarına yardımcı olacak.

</h3>Hi, <br/>
<p>My name is Paul and I am the owner of Big Blue Ventures. <br/></p>
<p>I am here today in front of all of you to ask for your support in helping me build the NEXT BIG THING. <br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>This is the Uber of Energy! </b><br/></p>
<p>My campaign is based on building an app to help energy consumers take back control of their energy consumption, costs and investments by letting them save huge money on their bills. I have consulted widely in the utilities industry and I want to see people get more value for their solar investment than they currently do. I also want people who do not have solar to benefit. My app will do precisely that. <br/></p>
<p>Your contribution will help us achieve the following: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest breakthrough in energy since the solar panel - millions of people around the world can dramatically impact global energy costs right away. <br/>
</li>
<li>Massive energy bill savings - potential for Billions in savings</li>
<li>Reduction on environmental impact </li>
<li>Positive contribution to the reduction of global warming<br/>
</li>
<li>Control over your solar investment</li>
<li>Huge reduction in payback time on your solar investment</li>
<li>Your contribution is generational, it simply grows as more people adopt it!<br/>
</li>
<li>You get to be part of a global revolution!<br/>
</li>
</ul> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> </div>We will need $ 500 000 AUD to build the free app. This money will be used to pay for: Cloud infrastructure, specialist developers who will code the integration, UX design, SAP HANA in-memory predictive analytics library functions and business procedures. The app will available on Android, iOS, Windows etc. and will be free. The build will be 5-6 months. I will be the project leader and chief designer. I will post updates on our progress against the plan on a weekly basis. <br/><p><br/></p><p>Perks - <br/></p><p>You will be able to manage your energy savings/earn money. You will be able to decide with whom you save energy and on what terms. How good is that? No more retailers dictating tariffs. <br/></p><p>There is even the potential to save/share energy savings with people in other countries. <br/></p><p>Funding - <br/></p><p>If we don't reach our funding goal, well, we will just keep trying because we have an utter and unfailing belief in this revolution. The app is designed so that it can be built in stages. <br/></p><p>Why? <br/></p><p>Because we believe this is such a fundamental benefit to humankind that we feel we cannot stop. Think about it, the ability to actually control your energy costs and not be tied to what your energy provider tells you to do. <br/></p><ul> </ul><div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Your contribution will help unleash a stepchange in the way we manage our energy. The world will benefit from a reduction in energy consumption and costs. <br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have multiple designs &amp; projects under my belt where I have successfuly designed and delivered custom solutions for clients. I have consulted to the utility industry for years and know many of the shortcomings as well as the many opportunities. <br/></p>
<p>I hold six world first designs in apps, some of which are patented. <br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>What challenges do we face? <br/><br/> 1: The first challenge is funding of course. But that is why I am here, to ask for your help to overcome that. <br/><br/>2: The second challenge may be the utility companies themselves. This app will cost them millions/billions in revenue, as that money will go back into the pockets of you and I, the hardworking consumer! <br/><br/>Initially I think they will resist the app, but when they see the benefits, they will come around. The app can help them wipe out the solar subsidy in the process. <br/><br/>23 million Australians can benefit, and many more than that internationally. I estimate the global market to be about 450 million users, VERY conservatively, with the value being over $30 Billion/annum in it's first year. I am happy to pledge 10% of the profits back to Indiegogo to you the funder as a thank you for your support. This money can be used to help others build their dream. <br/><br/>
<p>I am launching a Facebook/Twitter campaign to lobby for my solution. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you cannot contribute money, I welcome input to the prototype, UX and features you want to see once it's ready. <p><br/></p>
<p>Use the lovely Indiegogo share tools folks!<br/></p>

I am here today in front of all of you to ask for your support in helping me build the NEXT BIG THING. 

This is the Uber of Energy! 
My campaign is based on building an app to help energy consumers take back control of their energy consumption, costs and investments by letting them save huge money on their bills. I have consulted widely in the utilities industry and I want to see people get more value for their solar investment than they currently do. I also want people who do not have solar to benefit. My app will do precisely that. 
Your contribution will help us achieve the following: 

The biggest breakthrough in energy since the solar panel - millions of people around the world can dramatically impact global energy costs right away. 

Massive energy bill savings - potential for Billions in savings
Reduction on environmental impact 
Positive contribution to the reduction of global warming

Control over your solar investment
Huge reduction in payback time on your solar investment
Your contribution is generational, it simply grows as more people adopt it!

You get to be part of a global revolution!

   What We Need & What You Get We will need $ 500 000 AUD to build the free app. This money will be used to pay for: Cloud infrastructure, specialist developers who will code the integration, UX design, SAP HANA in-memory predictive analytics library functions and business procedures. The app will available on Android, iOS, Windows etc. and will be free. The build will be 5-6 months. I will be the project leader and chief designer. I will post updates on our progress against the plan on a weekly basis. Perks - You will be able to manage your energy savings/earn money. You will be able to decide with whom you save energy and on what terms. How good is that? No more retailers dictating tariffs. There is even the potential to save/share energy savings with people in other countries. Funding - If we don't reach our funding goal, well, we will just keep trying because we have an utter and unfailing belief in this revolution. The app is designed so that it can be built in stages. Why? Because we believe this is such a fundamental benefit to humankind that we feel we cannot stop. Think about it, the ability to actually control your energy costs and not be tied to what your energy provider tells you to do.     The ImpactYour contribution will help unleash a stepchange in the way we manage our energy. The world will benefit from a reduction in energy consumption and costs. 

I have multiple designs & projects under my belt where I have successfuly designed and delivered custom solutions for clients. I have consulted to the utility industry for years and know many of the shortcomings as well as the many opportunities. 
I hold six world first designs in apps, some of which are patented. 
    Risks & ChallengesWhat challenges do we face?  1: The first challenge is funding of course. But that is why I am here, to ask for your help to overcome that. 2: The second challenge may be the utility companies themselves. This app will cost them millions/billions in revenue, as that money will go back into the pockets of you and I, the hardworking consumer! Initially I think they will resist the app, but when they see the benefits, they will come around. The app can help them wipe out the solar subsidy in the process. 23 million Australians can benefit, and many more than that internationally. I estimate the global market to be about 450 million users, VERY conservatively, with the value being over $30 Billion/annum in it's first year. I am happy to pledge 10% of the profits back to Indiegogo to you the funder as a thank you for your support. This money can be used to help others build their dream. 
I am launching a Facebook/Twitter campaign to lobby for my solution. 

    Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot contribute money, I welcome input to the prototype, UX and features you want to see once it's ready.

<p>Covid-19 has made <u><i>Better Hygiene the New Normal</i></u>. <strong>Purify Products</strong> are the first of its kind that offers families 99.9% protection against colds, flu, covid-19, other viruses, bacteria, mold, and fungi. It promotes hygiene and cleanliness, reduces disease transfer, and provides a sanitary environment for the home.</p>

<p>Because of covid-19, we all spend more time on our hand hygiene, making sure our hands and especially our kids' hands were washed and dried properly. We infused our dispensers with antimicrobial technology, so diseases cannot be transferred from one per to another when touched. Also paper towels are dispensed one-at-a time to reduce consumption and waste.</p>

<div style=""clear:both;""><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I was inspired to create the <strong>Purify Products</strong> line as a result of PTSD while serving in the military. I developed a case of severe OCD; I felt compelled to wash my hands several times while in the bathroom, and wash all the bathroom sinks in any restroom I entered, whether it was a restaurant, business, or someone’s home!</span></div>
</div>
<div style=""clear:both;""> </div>
<p>One day, while using the restroom of a friend’s home, I found–to my dismay–that there were no paper towels available. I began to panic, the cloth hand towel was wet and dirty, and the decorative cloth towel display dry and crusty. In a frenzy, I ended up running to their kitchen for the paper towels roll, then went back the their restroom to clean the sink. It was here that I said to myself, <i>“why doesn’t someone make a paper towel dispenser that can be used in the home?”</i></p>
<p>This was the beginning of the <strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Purify</span></strong> <strong>Products </strong>line.</p>

<p><u><strong>I was Inspired by Dad's Habit</strong></u></p>
<p>Dad had OCD with paper towel rolls. Every day he would grab paper towels from the paper towel roll and neatly fold them into small rectangle shapes and stack them on his bedroom dresser. When we ran low on paper towel rolls, we would go to Dad’s bedroom and grab a few.</p>
<p>Dad passed away from Covid-19 on April 30, 2020 - 11 days shy of his 86th birthday. He would have loved the <strong>Purify Products</strong> custom made paper towels I designed - they are folded just like his.</p>
<p><u><strong>I am Encouraged By Mom's Support</strong></u></p>
<p>Mom is my best friend, confidant, advisor, and woman of wisdom and faith. She advised me through this whole process of starting a business. Together we'd watch Shark Tank every Friday and binge watch reruns every Saturday. She is quick to point out tips from the Sharks or the inventors that support our <strong>Purify Products</strong>.</p>
<p>I love you Mom for your continuous and endless support to push me tirelessly to bring real added value to the homes of families seeking to promote hygiene and cleanliness, reduce disease transfer, and provide a sanitary environment for their home.</p>

<strong>Laser Module</strong>: The 5W laser module uses Japan's Nichia 440nm 5000mW laser diode. The target spot is compressed by a special process to make the spot size a square of up to 0.08mm. And the engraving pattern is way more delicate and clearer, with more focused power, and a stronger engraving ability, allowing it to engrave glossy metal.</li>
<li>
<strong>Software</strong>: A new dedicated app was created for the new 5-watt model. The download path and the software auto recognize your device. And if you have a 1.6-watt and a 5-watt running at the same time, it won’t conflict with their operation on the same app. The working frame of the 5-watt model is appropriately reduced.</li>
<li>
<strong>Structure</strong>: The main structure has not changed, because the actual verification of the first generation provided a stable structure. It was only optimized in the structure of the laser module to create stronger accuracy.</li>
<li>
<strong>Appearance</strong>: The color and surface treatment process have been changed to make the product more aesthetically pleasing and beautiful.</li>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","What is PastedPaper?
Gorgeous, easy-to-use, organic sheets of removable high-quality wallpaper.
      . 
       
Available in an assortment of historic designs based on antique artwork
 Allowing you to easily bring timeless, unique, and affordable elegance into your home.
 
 
                                                             
Everything you need, you already have in your home. 
There is no need to bring anyone into your house 
to install wallcovering.
You've got this!
 

PastedPaper solves two main problems found with traditional wallpaper.
1.  Make it easy to put up. We figured out a way to make our designs fit beautifully on each sheet. 
2. We worked closely with our paper mills in applying a special paste on the back of our high-quality paper. All you need to do is wet the back by submerging it in water. Then apply to the wall and wipe off any excess water. The paste will be wet with water for about 15 minutes, giving you ample time to line each sheet up perfectly with the next. 
 
                                       

                                      

                                      

PastedPaper® is NEW. Innovative. Worry-Free Wallpaper. 
 
• PastedPaper® is easy for anyone to put up. 
• It’s sold in individual sheets – not rolls.
• Each sheet has been designed to line up perfectly with the next. 
• Strips off easily. No scraping. You’ll never be afraid of wallpaper again.
• Available in historical patterns from incredible designers such as William Morris, C.F.A. Voysey, and William Kilburn – allowing you to bring timeless, unique, and affordable elegance into your home. 

If you need to custom fit a sheet, all you need to do is trim with a straight edge and sharp blade. We have even used scissors in a pinch! Some customers have custom-cut PastedPaper sheets to hug an irregular stone wall and make circular areas for a dynamic look. 

 

PastedPaper will stay up forever. But, if you are ready to take it down and change up your space, PastedPaper sheets are easily removed and will not harm walls.
 
 

Our custom calculator makes it easy to choose the right amount of wallpaper for your project.
                                       
                             



  


There are many ways to use any extra sheets you may have! 
Line your kitchen drawers • Spruce up a serving tray • Make a special pencil holder • Cover a small tabletop • Embellish a trashcan • Make a desktop blotter • Use as a photo frame border.

PastedPaper is my passion, and I am so thrilled to share this with you. 
                                                                                                
 
                                                                   


We work closely with an environmentally responsible paper mill here in the USA. Lots of attention and care has gone into every detail. Together, the mill and PastedPaper have developed the perfect product.
 
Starting a business in the Covid Era
We are spending much more time at home. The need to reenvision our living/office space has become more important than ever—PastedPaper created a direct-to-customer relationship, where the customer is empowered to be the designer. You pick your design, enter the room dimensions into our website calculator, and with common household tools, you can install your new wallpaper in an afternoon. Now sit back and enjoy your new space.

 
 What surface can I put PastedPaper on?
Answer: Plaster Walls, Lightly Stuccoed Walls, Glass Ceramic, and Wood. 

Can you clean PastedPaper?
Answer: Yes! There is a very thin protective coating on the surface of all PastedPaper products that makes it easy to wipe down with just a damp sponge. Perfect for even kitchens and bathrooms!
 
How do I know how much product to order?
Answer: Go to our handy calculator on the pastedpaper.com site and enter the dimensions of the room you want to redesign.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Choose the number of 5 Minute Farm Vessels to Start With 4 pack or 8 pack.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>*We recommend the 8 Pack</strong> which can be grown in 1 Square foot of space, uses the same 1 square foot as the grow light, and to optimize the production using the same 40 watts of energy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">** You can always expand later and add more farm vessels.<br/><strong>Choose the Vessel Size: </strong>Plants grow equally well in both sizes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>We Recommend the Standard Size for those just starting and for the most versatility. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">
<strong>Standard: </strong>These are the most versatile as they are not restricted by height between where you place the light and the countertop. At 4 Inches tall they are great for growing both tall and short plants under a standard upper cabinet with light mounted.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">
<strong> Large: </strong>These are the go to when we have the vertical space or outdoors and what we use when growing commercially or at scale on standard big box store wire racks or adjustable shelves.

<h2>Living Food Kits Perks Descriptions: </h2>
<p><strong>Living Food Kits Rewards include everything you need but the liquid and the love.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose Standard Size of Large Size Vessel Kit.</li>
<li>Choose What You Want Make.</li>
<li>Kits Include everything you need but the water, juice or milk. </li>
<li>See Rewards Description and Below for Full Descriptions.</li>
<li>You will have the option to add even more SCOBYs, Cultures, Vinegar Mothers.</li>
<li>We even include choice of colors in the swing top bottles in these special Indiegogo rewards.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h2>Living Foods Kit Perks Options:<br/>Large or Standard</h2>
<p><strong>(1) Choose the Size Large (1650 ML/ 55+ 0z) or Standard (800 ML / 24 oz) </strong></p>
<p><strong>*We recommend the Large which include 2 x 1000 ML Bottles</strong> as it takes about the same time and effort to double your production and allows for more diversity afterwards like multiple flavors. </p>
<p>** You can always expand later and add more vessels or other starters like Kombucha to expand without having to buy more vessels or kits.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Size Vessels</strong> do shorten the time waiting but not by significant amounts but are easier to store in the refrigerator or stack due to their 4.5 inch height.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Thoughts on Which Size To Choose? </strong></p>
<p><strong> Standard: </strong>These are the most versatile as they are not restricted by height and can easily stack on top of each other inside the refrigerator or be placed on shelves that have limited vertical space. They are also great for personal on the go and taking on trips, to work, in the cooler... </p>
<p><strong> Large: </strong>These are the go to when we have the vertical space and what we typically take on the go when we will want more or when there are a few of us like to the pool, beach, parks, picnics, traveling and making as each system just makes so much with almost the same time and effort as the standard systems. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> Combination:  </strong>Not Sure - You can always get 1 or more of each and make multiples at the same time. 8 will fit in 1 square foot of space.<br/> </p>

</div><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Environmental commitments</strong></h3><p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p><p>Maximizing the life of the systems and components was a priority from the very beginning and throughout the process. We fully understand that the most sustainable products are those that are used for many generations, are technology independent and can be used for multiple purposes. We consider the entire lifespan from cradle to grave in our designs including the initial materials, manufacturing processes and end of life. We strive to create products that are not just carbon neutral but that eventually become carbon negative by growing enough in them to have removed more C02 than was required to manufacture, ship and use the products. Reusable is always better than recyclable that is why we approach the designs as Full Stack Sustainable from Manufacturing, Multi Use and Materials that will last indefinitely,</p><p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p><p>Reusable is always better than recyclable that is why we employed Full Stack / Life Span Sustainability as a goal form the beginning. Should anyone want to recycle them: - We will reward anyone who sends our systems or components back to us for repurposing, reusing or recycling. - We will either clean and reuse, redistribute or recycle for you. They are designed to be used again and again and again - and passed down to generations and we will gladly help with the knowledge to use them and full support.</p><p><strong>Sustainable materials</strong></p><p>We use 100% Food Grade Silicone in our system components. Made from the 2 most prevalent elements on the planet Oxygen and Silica - they last many lifetimes and then if / when recycled break back down into Oxygen and Silica. The lowest impact is NO ADDITIONAL MATERIALS. That is why even our components are part of the packaging - we designed the systems and components to ship and work together through the whole supply chain and they are designed to nest, usable components store other components and are packed together with minimal or no additional packaging or materials required. We are very minimal in our printing and ink usage and when we do have to print on items we do our best to use environmentally friendly processes and inks like Algae Based Inks as an example - even our boxes are designed to be reused in the production of food and improvement of the environment. Our Growth medium is a renewable sourced waste material from the production of the Coconut vs. other possible mediums that involve either decimating natural resources like bogs to make pods that are wrapped in plastic or stripping arable land to put in bags and then shipped. Our SCOBYS, Mothers, Cultures are in Re-useable Glass Containers with Bamboo Caps instead of most others which are shipped and packaged in single use Plastics, Mylar or other form of waste adding materials.</p><p><strong>Environmentally friendly factories</strong></p><p>We have spent 2 + years working on just the manufacturing processes with our amazing partners and suppliers from using humans over robots in manufacturing when possible. Humans have bills to pay and mouths to feed. We use additive and just in time manufacturing processes and even use the ""waste"" and trimmed pieces from the production of our products in our other other products and components. With on-site reuse / recycling of the silicone and reusing even quality control rejects, errors or test systems we are extremely low waste. By design! It's easy to do but easy not to do.</p><p><strong>Sustainable Distribution</strong></p><p>Our systems were designed with the last mile in mind - thats why our components fit inside each other, use durable materials and minimal amount of packaging required to protect the items, use reusable silicon multipurpose bags instead plastic bags, use renewable sourced growth medium... We are very proud of what is NOT in the packaging - No Plastic, No Peanuts and No Styrofoam.</p><p><strong>Something else</strong></p><p>Our Websites and Servers are powered by wind as the primary source and we are aggressively pursuing the goal to reach zero fossil fuels and be self sustaining in our grow and production facilities including pursuing and helping establish new high water marks for ISO-17001 Sustainability Standards. We are constantly looking for ways to reduce our carbon footprint from logistics, to having employees work virtually, responsibly sourcing materials and vetting vendors on their supply chain, materials and reviewing our own totality of cultural, environmental and social impact now and in the future. We may not always get it right or perfect but we sure try and will keep trying and learning and implementing changes where and when we can.</p></div>","5 Minute Farms turn your countertop, shelf, book case, patio, porch, desk, window... into a beautiful living food oasis.

Living Foods Kit Perks Options:Large or Standard
(1) Choose the Size Large (1650 ML/ 55+ 0z) or Standard (800 ML / 24 oz) 
*We recommend the Large which include 2 x 1000 ML Bottles as it takes about the same time and effort to double your production and allows for more diversity afterwards like multiple flavors. 
** You can always expand later and add more vessels or other starters like Kombucha to expand without having to buy more vessels or kits.
Standard Size Vessels do shorten the time waiting but not by significant amounts but are easier to store in the refrigerator or stack due to their 4.5 inch height.
Additional Thoughts on Which Size To Choose? 
 Standard: These are the most versatile as they are not restricted by height and can easily stack on top of each other inside the refrigerator or be placed on shelves that have limited vertical space. They are also great for personal on the go and taking on trips, to work, in the cooler... 
 Large: These are the go to when we have the vertical space and what we typically take on the go when we will want more or when there are a few of us like to the pool, beach, parks, picnics, traveling and making as each system just makes so much with almost the same time and effort as the standard systems. 
 Combination:  Not Sure - You can always get 1 or more of each and make multiples at the same time. 8 will fit in 1 square foot of space. 
What can I make with Living Food Collection Kits?
Yogurt Kits Include Fresh Cultures of many types to choose.| Probiotic Tea Kits are used to Make Kombucha, Jun Tea and Other Specialty Probiotic Teas.

We fully understand that the most sustainable products are those that are used for many generations, are technology independent and can be used for multiple purposes. We consider the entire lifespan from cradle to grave in our designs including the initial materials, manufacturing processes and end of life. We strive to create products that are not just carbon neutral but that eventually become carbon negative by growing enough in them to have removed more C02 than was required to manufacture, ship and use the products. Reusable is always better than recyclable that is why we approach the designs as Full Stack Sustainable from Manufacturing, Multi Use and Materials that will last indefinitely,Reusability and recyclabilityReusable is always better than recyclable that is why we employed Full Stack / Life Span Sustainability as a goal form the beginning. Should anyone want to recycle them: - We will reward anyone who sends our systems or components back to us for repurposing, reusing or recycling. - We will either clean and reuse, redistribute or recycle for you. They are designed to be used again and again and again - and passed down to generations and we will gladly help with the knowledge to use them and full support.Sustainable materialsWe use 100% Food Grade Silicone in our system components. Made from the 2 most prevalent elements on the planet Oxygen and Silica - they last many lifetimes and then if / when recycled break back down into Oxygen and Silica. The lowest impact is NO ADDITIONAL MATERIALS. That is why even our components are part of the packaging - we designed the systems and components to ship and work together through the whole supply chain and they are designed to nest, usable components store other components and are packed together with minimal or no additional packaging or materials required. We are very minimal in our printing and ink usage and when we do have to print on items we do our best to use environmentally friendly processes and inks like Algae Based Inks as an example - even our boxes are designed to be reused in the production of food and improvement of the environment. Our Growth medium is a renewable sourced waste material from the production of the Coconut vs. other possible mediums that involve either decimating natural resources like bogs to make pods that are wrapped in plastic or stripping arable land to put in bags and then shipped. Our SCOBYS, Mothers, Cultures are in Re-useable Glass Containers with Bamboo Caps instead of most others which are shipped and packaged in single use Plastics, Mylar or other form of waste adding materials.Environmentally friendly factoriesWe have spent 2 + years working on just the manufacturing processes with our amazing partners and suppliers from using humans over robots in manufacturing when possible. Humans have bills to pay and mouths to feed. We use additive and just in time manufacturing processes and even use the ""waste"" and trimmed pieces from the production of our products in our other other products and components. With on-site reuse / recycling of the silicone and reusing even quality control rejects, errors or test systems we are extremely low waste. By design! It's easy to do but easy not to do.Sustainable DistributionOur systems were designed with the last mile in mind - thats why our components fit inside each other, use durable materials and minimal amount of packaging required to protect the items, use reusable silicon multipurpose bags instead plastic bags, use renewable sourced growth medium... We are very proud of what is NOT in the packaging - No Plastic, No Peanuts and No Styrofoam.Something elseOur Websites and Servers are powered by wind as the primary source and we are aggressively pursuing the goal to reach zero fossil fuels and be self sustaining in our grow and production facilities including pursuing and helping establish new high water marks for ISO-17001 Sustainability Standards. We are constantly looking for ways to reduce our carbon footprint from logistics, to having employees work virtually, responsibly sourcing materials and vetting vendors on their supply chain, materials and reviewing our own totality of cultural, environmental and social impact now and in the future. We may not always get it right or perfect but we sure try and will keep trying and learning and implementing changes where and when we can.",61.0,3,"1 Campaign

revealed.  Using a simplified method of static composting he and his wife Dr. Su developed a 'static pile' bioreactor which produces a highly diverse, fungally dominated soil inoculant.  When used in conjunction with cover crops this new agricultural management system is called BEAM for biologically enhanced agricultural management.  An understanding of why Microbes in Bionoc are essential to plants is shown in this image.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy""

<h3>ABOUT HESTIA HARLOW</h3>
<p>Hestia Harlow was not originally created to be a company, but rather began as a passion to reinvent the party planning industry. Born from the notion that events are at the core of all of life’s important moments, we believe entertaining is something we should all do more of and would if it were easier.</p>
<p>As seasoned industry professionals, we are discernibly partial to entertaining, however, we recognize that throwing a party, even simply hosting at home, is not easy. These days, who has time to shop for place settings, plan menus, arrange flowers, and not to mention serve fancy cocktails, among other things?</p>
<p>Over the last decade this notion of ‘simplifying hosting’ continued to be at the core of our conversation; so, a few years ago, we decided it was finally time for this idea to come to fruition – make entertaining effortless while inspiring more people to throw parties at home.</p>
<p>While we began development on this passion project, it quickly became apparent that there was a great demand for a platform that could provide hyper-curated products and all the many resources to host in one place; and on top of that provide many of these items as a rental service, rather than a purchase. Genius! Well, we think so, seeing how companies like Rent the Runway have identified that people really didn’t want to own, but prefer to rent and return after special occasions. So, Hestia Harlow was born!</p>
<p>With our original mission in mind, we launched, and have given everyone access to designer tables, bespoke decorations, and hyper-curated experiences to effortlessly entertain at home.</p>
<p>We hope you join our community and continue on this exciting journey with us.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Introduction</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616718649/qeh6oaml3u8fugm3qr6n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>What we do</strong></u></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Ondoor Grocery  delivers grocery to your home in 2 hrs</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We have more than 2000 grocery products on our website</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Customers can shop online</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Ondoor services is ideal for old, sick, disabled, students &amp; busy people</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Especially in this COVID Pandemic</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">WE SERVE THEM &amp; KEEP THEM SAFE</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">On-Demand Grocery (ODG) is the typical story of a small local company focusing on customer service, which the big online grocers tend to ignore. In our small town, the big grocers deliver either the next day or charge an arm and a leg for delivering day-to-day groceries. We don’t see why it requires a very large company to accept simple grocery orders and deliver them to the consumers, when the consumers need them, and not, when the big retailer finds it convenient or cost-wise expedient. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So we started with a simple phone orders and direct to home deliveries. We often purchase items directly from the producers and farmers and pass on the cost savings to the consumer. So although we cannot match the bulk purchase capabilities of the large grocers, fact is we don’t have to. We are cost effective. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>We are raising funds to</u></h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">* Cover more geographical regions</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">* Serve a larger population </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We wish to become even more cost effective and to increase the number of products we stock. We want to be able to service customers for as many products as we can, so the consumer can benefit from our better service, even more</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616718677/o0iakgsgjqgrbawmanci.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""margin-left:36pt;text-align: center;""><strong>Mr Kamaljit Randhawa</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:36pt;text-align: center;"">Kamaljit is a hands-on entrepreneur, much like many of our customers. He started with doing everything right from purchasing goods, sorting and packaging them, and even delivering them to people’s homes or offices. Even now when it is all hands on the deck, he is the first one to dive right in. It keeps him grounded and helps him track the pulse of his business. Customer service is an obsession with him and always takes priority. He is deeply conscious that timely customer service is the one differentiator that he must protect at all costs. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:36pt;text-align: center;"">He has worked in the agricultural produce markets for 25 years and has been an agriculturist himself. So, he does not look at farm produce as a commodity being bought and sold. In fact, the cause of agriculturists is very close to Mr Kamaljit’s heart and it gives him great satisfaction to see consumers delight from the benefits of timely delivery of quality goods at very fair prices. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Advisor </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Ramesh has  Masters degree (M. Com) and MBA. He is from IT Industry and has worked as GM , VP (Sales &amp; marketing) in large IT companies and as CEO/President/entrepreneur in startups. Ramesh has lived in US for 10 yrs.

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Our campaign and why it's important to us</u></h2>
<p style=""margin-left:36pt;text-align: center;"">We believe the role of local enterprises will always have the edge in the business of at-home purchase and delivery of grocery and produce. Our region has the usual Canadian Superstores, Save-on-foods, Safeway, Walmart , Instacart and Amazon Fresh present but quality of last mile delivery leaves a lot to be desired and the consumer is frustrated. Our model of ‘local’ has found favor in various categories and we wish to build on what we have done already providing our customers the maximum value at the minimum price and at the right time. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:36pt;text-align: center;"">In order to do this, we need to expand our operations in respect of: </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">* Ability to store more goods </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">* Ability to store goods with the required climatic conditions (deep freezer etc.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">* Ability to service more customers  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We will be able to service all the households in the county of Lower main land (Metro Vancouver/ Fraser Valley) BC Canada in respect of their needs for groceries and PQR </p>

What we do
Ondoor Grocery  delivers grocery to your home in 2 hrs
We have more than 2000 grocery products on our website
Customers can shop online
Ondoor services is ideal for old, sick, disabled, students & busy people
Especially in this COVID Pandemic
WE SERVE THEM & KEEP THEM SAFE
On-Demand Grocery (ODG) is the typical story of a small local company focusing on customer service, which the big online grocers tend to ignore. In our small town, the big grocers deliver either the next day or charge an arm and a leg for delivering day-to-day groceries. We don’t see why it requires a very large company to accept simple grocery orders and deliver them to the consumers, when the consumers need them, and not, when the big retailer finds it convenient or cost-wise expedient. 
So we started with a simple phone orders and direct to home deliveries. We often purchase items directly from the producers and farmers and pass on the cost savings to the consumer. So although we cannot match the bulk purchase capabilities of the large grocers, fact is we don’t have to. We are cost effective. 
 
We are raising funds to
* Cover more geographical regions
* Serve a larger population 
We wish to become even more cost effective and to increase the number of products we stock. We want to be able to service customers for as many products as we can, so the consumer can benefit from our better service, even more

 
The Team
 

Mr Kamaljit Randhawa
Kamaljit is a hands-on entrepreneur, much like many of our customers. He started with doing everything right from purchasing goods, sorting and packaging them, and even delivering them to people’s homes or offices. Even now when it is all hands on the deck, he is the first one to dive right in. It keeps him grounded and helps him track the pulse of his business. Customer service is an obsession with him and always takes priority. He is deeply conscious that timely customer service is the one differentiator that he must protect at all costs. 
He has worked in the agricultural produce markets for 25 years and has been an agriculturist himself. So, he does not look at farm produce as a commodity being bought and sold. In fact, the cause of agriculturists is very close to Mr Kamaljit’s heart and it gives him great satisfaction to see consumers delight from the benefits of timely delivery of quality goods at very fair prices. 
 

Karan Preet Singh 
VP – Warehouse Operations
Has worked with a large Services company as a supervisor. His expertise is in managing large force and scheduling and working under tremendous pressure to deliver timely services
 
 

Ramesh Kulkarni
Advisor 
Ramesh has  Masters degree (M. Com) and MBA. He is from IT Industry and has worked as GM , VP (Sales & marketing) in large IT companies and as CEO/President/entrepreneur in startups. Ramesh has lived in US for 10 yrs. He has turned around several loss making companies in his career. He runs a Non-profit org in BC Canada.
 
Our campaign and why it's important to us
We believe the role of local enterprises will always have the edge in the business of at-home purchase and delivery of grocery and produce. Our region has the usual Canadian Superstores, Save-on-foods, Safeway, Walmart , Instacart and Amazon Fresh present but quality of last mile delivery leaves a lot to be desired and the consumer is frustrated. Our model of ‘local’ has found favor in various categories and we wish to build on what we have done already providing our customers the maximum value at the minimum price and at the right time. 
In order to do this, we need to expand our operations in respect of: 
* Ability to store more goods 
* Ability to store goods with the required climatic conditions (deep freezer etc.)
* Ability to service more customers  
We will be able to service all the households in the county of Lower main land (Metro Vancouver/ Fraser Valley) BC Canada in respect of their needs for groceries and PQR 

 
 

What We Need 
 
We need CAD 2 Million to be used for the following purposes:
Increasing Warehousing Capability – CAD 600,000
Financing Inventory of Goods – CAD 800,000
Hiring 7-8 Delivery Boys – CAD 200,000
Hiring 4-5 Salesmen – CAD 250,000
Marketing – CAD 150,000
Other Operating Costs – CAD 50,000 
 
What You Get
 
* For orders over CAD 50 we deliver free and within 2 hours 
                        *  Your contributions will help the old, sick & disabled in Surrey BC by making grocery shopping safe & easy for them
 
 What we will do with the funds
If we raise
Less than CAD 500,000 – The entire sum goes to fund Inventory+ Delivery boys
500,000 to 1,200,000 – We will Hire Delivery Boys to give better Customer Service
 1,200,000 to 2,000,000 – We will rent more Warehousing capability to improve the range of our services 
 

The Impact
The world is moving towards globalization and big corporations but somewhere we are losing the local touch. To the big retainers Surrey BC is only a dot on the map. But to us, it is our home and in this business we are solving the problems faced by our neighbours and people we have known all our lives. 
We make it safe & easy for old, sick & disabled people during the pandemic & after.

The hydrogen atom size is very small so it easily penetrates in between the fibers of all fabrics repelling dirt particles into the water.  Traditional chemical-based laundry cleaning agents contain strong bases of sodium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide. Magnesium hydroxide is an alkaline cleaning agent which can dissolve fats like sebum, oils, and protein-based substances. They form an emulsion of the oily or solid dirt particles that are held in suspension in laundry wash water, ready to be rinsed away. <a href=""https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/am302910q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Magnesium hydroxide is also a very strong antibacterial agent</a>. Additionally, there's no need to clean or descale as ECO naturally cleans washing machines and tubes leaving no mold-causing soap residue. </p><p><strong>Why we care?</strong></p><p>Toxic cleaning chemicals are very damaging to the environment.

So safe it’s ideal for babies and people with allergies. After a long day, sit back and enjoy a nice warm bath that benefits your body and the environment!How Does ECOBATH250 Work?The Infuser acts as a therapeutic agent by means of continuously releasing molecular hydrogen (H2) in each bath. A clinical study proved that a warm water bath with released molecular hydrogen will be distributed throughout the whole body in only 10 minutes and has numerous health benefits. Additionally, magnesium hydroxide is released into the water which acts as a natural and nontoxic cleaning agent. There are numerous clinical studies by scientists that have published PubMed articles confirming the safety and efficacy of molecular hydrogen:
""Hydrogen gas and hydrogen water act as a therapeutic and preventive antioxidant” 
“Explicitly proved that molecular hydrogen exerts therapeutic effects”
“Molecular hydrogen is known to have antioxidative properties”
“Hydrogen as a new medical therapy”
How Does ECOBOOST50 & ECOWASH10 Work? Ultra-high purity, specially formulated magnesium reacts with water in a washing machine to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas (also known as molecular hydrogen). Mg + H2O → Mg(OH)2 → H2 Washing machine agitation releases the micro-scale magnesium hydroxide and molecular hydrogen into the water which initiates the cleaning, deodorizing and antibacterial disinfecting process of the laundry fabric. Hydrogen gas is present in the water in nano-bubble form (Science Direct). The hydrogen atom size is very small so it easily penetrates in between the fibers of all fabrics repelling dirt particles into the water.  Traditional chemical-based laundry cleaning agents contain strong bases of sodium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide. Magnesium hydroxide is an alkaline cleaning agent which can dissolve fats like sebum, oils, and protein-based substances. They form an emulsion of the oily or solid dirt particles that are held in suspension in laundry wash water, ready to be rinsed away. Magnesium hydroxide is also a very strong antibacterial agent. Additionally, there's no need to clean or descale as ECO naturally cleans washing machines and tubes leaving no mold-causing soap residue. Why we care?Toxic cleaning chemicals are very damaging to the environment. The laundry industry uses tons of chemicals and synthetic compounds daily which takes a huge toll on the environment, especially our water system.  A Washington University Study* found that all of the top selling laundry detergent brands tested, each contained at least one ingredient considered hazardous and toxic under federal law. None of these ingredients were listed on the labels.  The average household creates 2.4 pounds of plastic laundry waste every year--that's a lot of plastic waste in our landfills. Between 1.15 and 2.41 million tons of plastic waste enters the ocean every year from rivers (PubMed). This is unsustainable! ECO creates no waste. It’s time we help out the environment, ourselves and our children.EfficacyThe effectiveness of the products was our first hurdle and the lab test results were awesome! ECOWASH100 cleans as good as detergent. ECOBOOST50 enhanced laundry detergent cleaning by 40%.ECOBOOST50 has far superior antibacterial effect. It reduced the bacteria to almost zero in 10 minutes!ECOBOOST50 reduces odor 5-7X better than detergent. ECOWASH100 reduces odor 10X better than detergent.Who are we?ECO line was developed by Marketscape which was established in 2010 to help natural CPG vendors grow their business in USA and Canada. We built an integrated distribution, sales and market intelligence model that’s low cost. Since we can instantly leverage this model for the ECO line, we can expedite our route to market and be cost-effective. What we need now is funds for production, launch and marketing of the ECO line.Timeline2018

There was always something missing or made harder, and everything took you away from that simple act of pouring wine from a bottle into a glass.  </p><p>Luck came when least expected. While working on a packaging dilemma, it was suggested to create a box in the shape of a bottle and place the contents inside ... this simple suggestion sparked the Eureka moment. </p><p>Could that same approach be applied to a real bottle and solve a different problem? Say, the outdoor wine experience? With a few hand-drawn sketches, the basic concept was born. </p><p>So he set out with a simple mission: make wine and the outdoors an experience worth celebrating.  Wine is worth the effort, right?</p><p>Soon the Carivino team was assembled. Each with a passion for wine and time spent outdoors - we set out to do something amazing. Two years in the making, we are proud to introduce our debut product. It is beautiful to hold, filled with engineering marvel and simple to use. We wanted to make something special for ourselves and for all wine lovers around the world. </p><p>Cheers, and thank you for your support!</p><div data-id=""24407518""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p> </p>

 Chris Clyde, the founder of Carivino tells the story... it began with an observation, a bit of accidental luck, and that ""aha moment."" He noticed the outdoor wine experience always felt incomplete. There was always something missing or made harder, and everything took you away from that simple act of pouring wine from a bottle into a glass.  Luck came when least expected. While working on a packaging dilemma, it was suggested to create a box in the shape of a bottle and place the contents inside ... this simple suggestion sparked the Eureka moment. Could that same approach be applied to a real bottle and solve a different problem? Say, the outdoor wine experience? With a few hand-drawn sketches, the basic concept was born. So he set out with a simple mission: make wine and the outdoors an experience worth celebrating.  Wine is worth the effort, right?Soon the Carivino team was assembled. Each with a passion for wine and time spent outdoors - we set out to do something amazing. Two years in the making, we are proud to introduce our debut product. It is beautiful to hold, filled with engineering marvel and simple to use. We wanted to make something special for ourselves and for all wine lovers around the world. Cheers, and thank you for your support!

<p>Initially, as a MagicTime user you need to syncronize your mobile phone (Android or IOS) with the MagicTime. Our software is compatible with most devices.  Afterwards, you are able to select different color modes ranging from: <i>Pure color, gradient colour, multicolors and dynamic color changes.</i></p>
<p>After
setting the color, you can select the working mode. There are 4 working modes
available for you: <i>Clock mode, date mode, scoreline mode and countdown
mode.</i></p>
<p>The
clock mode shows you hour and minute; the date mode presents day, month and
year; the scoring mode permits you to set the digital on the left and right
according to your own needs; the countdown mode allows you to set the time to
be counted down. The maximal and minimal time you can set is 99 min, 59s and
99h, 59min respectively.</p>

Since I started the business in 2009, my main goal has been to provide fast and AFFORDABLE broadband internet to anyone and everyone. </p>
<p>Even though Cosmos Wireless has the most competitive internet tariffs on the island, we are not there yet. The reason that internet is so very expensive here, is because it is brought to Cyprus via submarine fibre optic cables (from Greece, thousands of Kilometres away), which cost many millions of Euros each.</p>
<p>My idea, is to be the first to bring internet to Cyprus, via Wireless Link, from the neighbouring state of Israel (aprox. 350 Kilometres away). Proving that this is possible will not be easy, but once we do it successfully, everyone will do it, thus driving the cost of broadband internet down, and on a par with the EU, and even getting into the Guinness World Records in the process (as this will be the longest WiFi link ever created in the world).</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We're going to need €50,000. That will be used to secure 2 sites (one on a hill top in Israel, and one on a hill top in Cyprus). We will need to construct two 60 dBi antenna's, so that we can modify our Airfiber5x systems. We will also need 2 much smaller links (one link in Israel linking the transmitter with our ISP over there, and the other in Cyprus, linking us with the receiver).</p>
<p>There are not really any perks, except that I will try to mention each and everyone of you in the Guinness Book of Records, when this is published. You can also feel good about the fact that you have helped a whole country get on the road to faster and more affordable internet.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, we will use your contributions to take us as far as possible.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Once we successfully complete this project, we know that other Internet Service Providers in Cyprus (and around the world) will follow suit and emulate what we have done. Internet is a valuable tool for young children, and older children alike. Not having access to the internet nowadays, is a major disadvantage. Making the internet affordable for everyone will give everyone, rich and poor alike the same basic advantages.</p>
<p>Cosmos Wireless has already provided internet to almost the whole of Cyprus, and we have shown that you don't need to be a big corporation to provide a great service. We even have lower prices than several of the major ISP's, including the main semi-state owned Cyta.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The only real obstacle to this project is the distance. However, with standard equipment this link is possible. Just recently, a team in Italy successfully deployed a link from the mainland to Sardinia , a distance greater than 300 kilometres. Suffice to say their connection was very stable and very fast.</p>
<p>As we are a Wireless Internet Service Provider, we deploy long range wireless links almost on a daily basis. We have never failed to successfully deploy a link, and this project will be no exception.

Voila – dinner was served.

He started to learn how to cook after a date where he tried to be romantic by impressing his girlfriend with a home cooked meal. However, he didn’t know how to cook, so he went to McDonalds and bought 6 GRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICHES, threw out the sandwich buns, and also bought white rice from a Chinese restaurant. Voila – dinner was served. Needless to say she wasn’t impressed, as a result Ed began watching cooking shows so that he would never have to rely on McDonalds or Chinese takeout again. Risks and challengesThe biggest risk to our project is delay and timing.

<p><b>Heat:</b> Even if the look is right and the keyboard feel is authentic, if there’s no heat your cat won’t buy into it. Internal heat is the key to your cat’s passion for your laptop keyboard, and we have figured out the perfect temperature that replicates laptop heat: <b>100º to 110º F (38º to 43º C)</b>. This temperature range is perfect for warming your cat’s belly while they laze about on the Cattop. Not too hot and not too cool, your cat will never want to leave the Cattop even after you’re done on your computer!</p>

<p><b>Safety: </b>​And speaking of heat, we take safety very seriously. We’re cat owners ourselves! Cattop has two main safety features: a thermal cutoff safety switch protects your feline friend from getting too hot. After the Cattop peaks over a set temperature it turns off. The other safety feature is a “kill switch” that cuts off all power to the Cattop if the user closes their computer laptop lid and forgets to turn off the Cattop. Your cat’s safety is of the utmost importance to us, and we want your cat to stay safe and healthy while she uses the Cattop.  </p>

<figcaption><i>Safety built with your cat in mind</i></figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Screen: </b>The screen of the Cattop is glossy black plastic. The reason for the screen being plastic and glossy is intentional. Your cat isn’t as interested in the images on your screen most of the time as, say, a laser pointer’s dot. Because of the glossy sheen of the Cattop’s screen, you can shine a laser pointer at it to redirect your cat’s attention back onto the Cattop while you’re trying to finish up a task. Or you can create a positive association between the Cattop and play by focusing your cat’s attention on the screen to give both you and your cat a well-deserved play break.</p>

<p>The laptop is a perfectly odd but logical place for a cat to lay its head. But when we need to use our laptops, pull out the Cattop and give your furry friend access to that taboo place they’ve always wanted to enjoy but couldn’t!</p>

<p>No one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one called the Cattop. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what I see as the risks:</p>
<p><b>MANUFACTURING:</b> Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.</p>
<p><b>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS</b>: As the Cattop gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made. Cattop's Pre-production prototype is just weeks away from being delivered for testing!  </p>
<p><b>FULFILLMENT: </b>Sometimes things go awry that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.</p>
<p>We are working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our Cattop customer.</p>
<p>Any pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal. Cattop is going to be your cat's new favorite place to rest and play while you get work done.  With Cattops heated keyboard and solid build, you can't go wrong with this new product all Cats will love. </p>

Cattop has two main safety features: a thermal cutoff safety switch protects your feline friend from getting too hot. After the Cattop peaks over a set temperature it turns off. The other safety feature is a “kill switch” that cuts off all power to the Cattop if the user closes their computer laptop lid and forgets to turn off the Cattop. Your cat’s safety is of the utmost importance to us, and we want your cat to stay safe and healthy while she uses the Cattop.  


Safety built with your cat in mind
Screen: The screen of the Cattop is glossy black plastic. The reason for the screen being plastic and glossy is intentional. Your cat isn’t as interested in the images on your screen most of the time as, say, a laser pointer’s dot. Because of the glossy sheen of the Cattop’s screen, you can shine a laser pointer at it to redirect your cat’s attention back onto the Cattop while you’re trying to finish up a task. Or you can create a positive association between the Cattop and play by focusing your cat’s attention on the screen to give both you and your cat a well-deserved play break.

 Use a laser pointer and point it at Cattop's screen to redirect your cats attention.
The laptop is a perfectly odd but logical place for a cat to lay its head. But when we need to use our laptops, pull out the Cattop and give your furry friend access to that taboo place they’ve always wanted to enjoy but couldn’t!

Cattop I - Functional Prototype 
Pre-manufacting verification of the Cattop I 
Cattop has been working with Bold Industries to identify and select a socially-responsible manufacturer to pre-engineer and design a functional prototype and produce the Cattop.  

(bold-industries.com)
 Bold Industries recently delivered a functional prototype of the Cattop I.   The functional prototype is strictly used to validate the product before manufacturing. 
We plugged in the fuctional prototype and handed it over to Cattop's official test cat ""Burgers"" who spent no time getting comfortable with the Cattop I.  
Burgers reaction to the functional prototype!

Hmmm...Seems to check out .  

""This is puuuuuurrrrfect""

""You mean I have my own heated laptop now?"" 
Cattop's cable is extra sturdy because some cats love to chew on cables.. Please note these cables aren't chew proof but they are sturdy and will give you time to correct any chewing issues.  


Burgers is a big cat!  We built Cattop with big cats in mind.   The functional prototype's sturdy design had no issues supporting Burgers weight as he leaned against the screen.The First Cattop Prototype 

 

TechShop DC-Arlington
Cattop Alpha was constructed at TechShop of DC-Arlington by Kyle Barras to verify what we've already known, cats are obsessed with our laptops and want their own!  

The key elements cats love the most are the feeling and sound of a real keyboard and the warmth that laptops generate.  Kyle gave us a description of the complete build process and we've posted a portion of it here for our investors.  
 
The 3D CAD file for the overall Cattop dimensions was generated in Autodesk Inventor.Milling the acrylic spacer on the manual vertical mill. 


 This was a slow and steady process, and resulted in a smooth pocket for the stainless steel plates.

 

 Using the Flow waterjet cutter, stainless steel plate was cut with the same file used to generate the cardboard mockups.

 A bit of rubber gasket was added to the cord channel in order to prevent dust from getting into the assembly and onto the enclosed heating element.

 The beautiful Cattop Alpha Prototype

 Test cat Burgers laid and played on Cattop Alpha Prototype for hours. The face says it all! ♥ The Final Goal


The wait is almost over furry friends.  Ask your human to get you the only gift you truly want this year.


This is the phase where we need your help with Cattop.  The design of Cattop is complete, both prototypes work perfectly and the final product has begun the manufacturing process.  We know this will be an excellent product your cat will absolutely love.  

Get your cat the gift they deserve and will actually use.  Get them the Cattop!  
Thank you




Cattop Timeline


Risks & Challenges


  
No one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one called the Cattop. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what I see as the risks:
MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.
PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the Cattop gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made. Cattop's Pre-production prototype is just weeks away from being delivered for testing!  
FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.
We are working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our Cattop customer.
Any pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal. Cattop is going to be your cat's new favorite place to rest and play while you get work done.  With Cattops heated keyboard and solid build, you can't go wrong with this new product all Cats will love.",26.0,1,"1 Campaign

Leo has a cat & Johnny got a dog.  We have this household cleanup conversation one night at a dinner gathering that both of our pets were shedding quite a bit of hair everywhere around the house.   We destine to find a solution for this.   After a lot of trial and error, we come up with this idea of creating this tool.

<p>We have learned that coverage, flow, and warmth is what makes a great shower. Our research has shown us there are 2 key dimensions to spray coverage: (1) Total spray area covered and (2) Distribution of the spray within the total spray area (More uniform distribution = better coverage). </p>

<p><b>To deliver a great user experience with less water than a conventional shower*</b></p>
<p>Here is a brief story of the Shower Technology evolution.</p>
<div data-id=""18680291""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1510088515/girbzdm6tqo4eljvdl2e.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>This Rinse Efficiency video shows how the Aurajet spray pattern creates more coverage than conventional showering*.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9tVIH-Rhmk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Aurajet technology helps Rua to generate up to 20% more total spray force*. It has twice the amount of a surface area of water in contact with the skin*:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better feeling of COVERAGE </li>
<li>Better feeling of WARMTH</li>
<li>Better stimulation of nerve endings </li>
<li>Better evenness of spray pressure on skin </li>
<li>Better overall experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Rua utilizes hidden nozzles which generate individual jets of water that collide against precisely angled surfaces within the elegant contours of the showerhead. At that moment of collision, the water travels across the surface edge and launches out from the channel, creating stunning fans of water. </p>
<div data-id=""18680500""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510793618/ihmlobveseky40i9gwra.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<ul>
<li>13 evenly spaced “Invisible” holes (nozzles) made of silicone rubber, generate single jets of water </li>
<li>These jets of water travel a short distance before hitting a precisely engineered hydrophobic “impinging surface” </li>
<li>When the jets hit the impinging surface, it spreads out into a fan-shaped sheet of water </li>
<li>These impinging surfaces are all set at different angles, creating an even spray with Fan are wide enough to fill the gaps yet leave a very defined and clean spray perimeter – limited spray “noise” </li>
</ul>

<p>With water shortage being a global concern, water conservation and efficiency of water use were paramount when we were developing Rua. Rua is the culmination of years of research combined with the extensive knowledge and expertise of our engineering team.</p>
<div data-id=""18680682""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1510088518/wdy4rmh14gxuhl9jghyu.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>When we started to design Rua, we decided it should conform to the new California State Energy Commission's regulations and delivers a flow rate of 1.8 gallons per minute or less. And we did it - Rua is the first shower with Aurajet technology to use less than 1.8 Gpm.</p>
<div data-id=""18761653""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1510088518/zeet8wmvoe3zm6rxf1gy.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>With Rua we all can take better care of water consumption just by taking a shower. And saving water no longer means a bad shower experience - we have made sure of that.</p>
<div data-id=""18763314""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1510088519/gujtybgr9jfhzc4g10ll.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Today, with our increasingly hectic and constantly connected lives, the bathroom has become a room of considerable importance. It is the one room where we can retreat, shut the door, take time out and be ourselves. It is our sanctuary of personal wellbeing. It is important that we do what we can to enhance this very personal moment, and deliver the best shower experience possible.</p>
<h3><b>RUA vs. CONVENTIONAL SHOWER</b></h3>
<p>Conventional showers generally distribute water in sparse, uneven individual streams that result in inconsistent skin contact and localized force. </p>
<p>In addition to that most of the standard showerheads in the US use 2.5 Gallons of water per minute (according to US Environmental Protection Agency). On the contrast, Rua uses 1.8 Gpm. This is 30% less than 2.5 Gpm.</p>
<h3><b>RUA vs. NEBIA</b></h3>
<p>Other existing shower technologies can save water but the experience is often compromised. Weak water mists and clouds can lose heat faster. This equates to less warmth and therefore a poorer overall showering experience.</p>
<div data-id=""18779042""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1510088519/jbcu0hkh9t5bzrsqokj7.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Rua is a water saving shower without compromise. The beauty is in the way we create unique fans of water to deliver a truly amazing showering experience, all without using any more water.</p>
<h3><b>RUA vs. AIO SHOWER</b></h3>
<p>Whilst we have had Aurajet® technology for a few years, our Rua design represents a significant advancement in water saving.</p>
<p>Rua revolutionary square design uses fewer nozzles than Aio, a more concentrated spray pattern, and only 1.8USGpm. Rua truly is the perfect balance of form and function. </p>

<h3><b>OPTION 1: USE IT AS A HAND SHOWER</b></h3>
<p>To upgrade your bathroom with ease, simply unscrew your old handset and add Rua standalone handset for a truly stimulating shower experience.</p>

<p>As long as your current mixing valve meets the minimum operating pressure requirements, then there is no needs to replace your mixing valve. Minimum operating pressure is 1 bar/100 KPA/14.5 PSI. The handset needs a ½ inch BSP hose. This will be compatible with most existing fittings.</p>
<p><b>Please note: We include all the accessories needed for the installation: hose, adjustable arm holder or the wall mount. </b></p>
<h3><b>OPTION 2: USE IT AS A WALL SHOWER</b></h3>

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>If you have a wall shower you will be able to install Rua using an inlet connector and the wall mount.

   Rua generates bigger water droplets which create up to 20% more of the total spray force than conventional showers*.   Rua's innovative spray system provides better stimulation of the nerve endings, particularly the areas where nerve endings have a higher density (e.g. face). This gives you better efficiency in cleansing and rinsing and more even pressure on the skin.  Rua has twice more coverage than a conventional shower*. That means twice the amount of surface area of water at the contact with the skin at any given time. It provides you with a better feeling of warmth, better feeling of coverage, and better evenness of spray pressure on the skin.    We are from New Zealand, an island surrounded by the ocean. As an island nation, we think that taking care of our most precious resource - water - is extremely important. Water shortage is real in many regions around the world and it won't get better unless we do something. Spending less water on your daily shower is a great starting point. But for many, it's hard to sacrifice a great shower experience. That's why we've created Rua - a shower system, that provides exceptional power-shower experience and helps you to use less water.  Save water with no compromise on the shower experience.Beauty aside, Rua is super water efficient – it uses only 1.8 Gallons of water per minute (meets California 2018 water usage regulations). The water flow rate is optimised to be water efficient without compromising the spray's power and coverage. 1.8 Gpm (gallons of water per minute) is 28% less than 2.5 Gpm. (2.5 Gpm what US standard showerheads use, according to US Environmental Protection Agency)Rua retains more warmth than mist-type showersUsing less water doesn’t help the environment much if you have to use more warm water to keep your shower experience great. More warm water for your shower – more energy to heat it up. Water in the “mist/cloud” - type showers and traditional water-saving showerheads tend to get cool quickly after it is sprayed from the shower head. Rua retains more warmth than mist-type showers.

 
Rua is very simple to install - you can do it just in a few minutes.
You can choose one of the two options that work best for you. No need to call a plumber.

 
The first option is to replace your existing hand shower - just connect Rua to your existing hose or use the one we provide.
The second option is to use Rua as a wall shower and install it using the connector. Wall mount and connector come with your order - you don't need to buy them separately.
Please note: We include all the accessories needed for the installation: hose, adjustable arm holder or the wall mount. 
Scroll down to see the installation videos.  

 
No matter where you are in the world, if you have a Rua shower, you are connected to New Zealand. 

 
There are 115 employees who work on-site at Methven's manufacturing facility in Auckland and 14 members of the company's design and innovation team who are responsible for the look and feel of the products. It sounds a lot but in fact, we are still a small team, a family. Many of our employees have worked with us for over 25 years.
A significant number of our employees live locally so we invest a lot of effort in maintaining water quality and protect wildlife around the area. Now we want to bring our values globally. 
Take a look at our factory and meet real people who helped to create Rua.

 
All Rua shower handsets will be manufactured at our factory in Auckland, New Zealand, which means we have full control and understanding of the Rua handset manufacturing process. And to all our backers we offer a lifetime warranty on Rua.

 
A Lifetime Replacement Warranty applies for the lifetime of the original purchaser for domestic/residential usage. If you plan to use Rua for your business please learn more about our commercial warranty here.

We have learned that coverage, flow, and warmth is what makes a great shower. Our research has shown us there are 2 key dimensions to spray coverage: (1) Total spray area covered and (2) Distribution of the spray within the total spray area (More uniform distribution = better coverage). 

Recap… 

Better coverage = more WARMTH 
Better coverage = better SENSATION

Rua uses the available water in a fundamentally better way to deliver WARMTH and SENSATION to the user also means:
To deliver a great user experience with less water than a conventional shower*
Here is a brief story of the Shower Technology evolution.

This Rinse Efficiency video shows how the Aurajet spray pattern creates more coverage than conventional showering*.

Aurajet technology helps Rua to generate up to 20% more total spray force*. It has twice the amount of a surface area of water in contact with the skin*:

Better feeling of COVERAGE 
Better feeling of WARMTH
Better stimulation of nerve endings 
Better evenness of spray pressure on skin 
Better overall experience

Rua utilizes hidden nozzles which generate individual jets of water that collide against precisely angled surfaces within the elegant contours of the showerhead. At that moment of collision, the water travels across the surface edge and launches out from the channel, creating stunning fans of water. 


13 evenly spaced “Invisible” holes (nozzles) made of silicone rubber, generate single jets of water 
These jets of water travel a short distance before hitting a precisely engineered hydrophobic “impinging surface” 
When the jets hit the impinging surface, it spreads out into a fan-shaped sheet of water 
These impinging surfaces are all set at different angles, creating an even spray with Fan are wide enough to fill the gaps yet leave a very defined and clean spray perimeter – limited spray “noise” 


 


With water shortage being a global concern, water conservation and efficiency of water use were paramount when we were developing Rua. Rua is the culmination of years of research combined with the extensive knowledge and expertise of our engineering team.

When we started to design Rua, we decided it should conform to the new California State Energy Commission's regulations and delivers a flow rate of 1.8 gallons per minute or less. And we did it - Rua is the first shower with Aurajet technology to use less than 1.8 Gpm.

With Rua we all can take better care of water consumption just by taking a shower. And saving water no longer means a bad shower experience - we have made sure of that.

Today, with our increasingly hectic and constantly connected lives, the bathroom has become a room of considerable importance. It is the one room where we can retreat, shut the door, take time out and be ourselves. It is our sanctuary of personal wellbeing. It is important that we do what we can to enhance this very personal moment, and deliver the best shower experience possible.
RUA vs. CONVENTIONAL SHOWER
Conventional showers generally distribute water in sparse, uneven individual streams that result in inconsistent skin contact and localized force. 
In addition to that most of the standard showerheads in the US use 2.5 Gallons of water per minute (according to US Environmental Protection Agency). On the contrast, Rua uses 1.8 Gpm. This is 30% less than 2.5 Gpm.
RUA vs. NEBIA
Other existing shower technologies can save water but the experience is often compromised. Weak water mists and clouds can lose heat faster. This equates to less warmth and therefore a poorer overall showering experience.

Rua is a water saving shower without compromise. The beauty is in the way we create unique fans of water to deliver a truly amazing showering experience, all without using any more water.
RUA vs. AIO SHOWER
Whilst we have had Aurajet® technology for a few years, our Rua design represents a significant advancement in water saving.
Rua revolutionary square design uses fewer nozzles than Aio, a more concentrated spray pattern, and only 1.8USGpm. Rua truly is the perfect balance of form and function. 

 

 
OPTION 1: USE IT AS A HAND SHOWER
To upgrade your bathroom with ease, simply unscrew your old handset and add Rua standalone handset for a truly stimulating shower experience.

As long as your current mixing valve meets the minimum operating pressure requirements, then there is no needs to replace your mixing valve. Minimum operating pressure is 1 bar/100 KPA/14.5 PSI. The handset needs a ½ inch BSP hose. This will be compatible with most existing fittings.
Please note: We include all the accessories needed for the installation: hose, adjustable arm holder or the wall mount. 
OPTION 2: USE IT AS A WALL SHOWER

If you have a wall shower you will be able to install Rua using an inlet connector and the wall mount. You can adjust the angle of the shower for better performance. Both accessories are included in the packaging. 

 

 
HERE IS WHAT COMES WITH YOUR ORDER:

or 6 inches hose and an adjustable arm holder

Methven started as an iron and brass foundry in 1886 in Dunedin and was involved in manufacturing ammunition for the New Zealand Army during the war years from 1939-1945.

 
Methven is more than 130 years old but we still are one family. 
The employees in the New Zealand team has a combined service of 1306 years.

 

 

Methven has been around for a few years. Actually more than a 130. Although we are old and have our own manufacturing, we are still a small company from New Zealand. Bringing innovations to life and creating awareness is not that easy from here at the bottom of the world. That's why we need your help. 
Help us to crowdfund our project, scale the manufacturing and bring this project to life. 
A successful campaign will help us to make more people aware of the clean water shortage issue and technologies that help to solve it. It will also help us to scale the manufacturing and create more opportunities for the local community.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">SoleMate Sox- MatchMaker For Lost Socks</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Born From Frustration+Love</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! I'm Catenya McHenry, inventor of SoleMate Sox magnetic socks. How many of you have lost socks? Unless you live on a remote island in the South Pacific (take me there), you probably have a sack of singles just hoping their sock mate will come back. SoleMate Sox is the solution for lost socks.</p>
<p>This idea of SoleMate Sox was born from raw frustration! Nearly every morning, one of my three children, is running down the hall yelling they have no socks, let alone matching pairs, free of holes in the toes. I kept thinking there had to be something on the market that held socks together but I found nothing, online and in stores!! I know, I was just as shocked too because the sock industry is a billion dollar empire.</p>
<p>What started as a homemade solution at my kitchen table just to figure out if I could actually invent a fix, turned into hundreds of research hours, design+strategy meetings with engineers, magnet behavior experiments, visits to sock manufacturers, fabric research, several prototypes, sock samples, magnet testing sessions, and nearly 2 1/2 years of development. All of that has lead patent-pending amazing technology to keep your socks from being single forever.</p>

<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ny3x7sHWN7U?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>The technology,  functionality+practicality is one thing, design+comfort is another. I had to make sure to create socks that were far from bleh+ boring- that people would actually be excited to slip on or break glass ceilings in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481351743/gx5kvhxdsyxg0erf9viv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Love in Design+Storytelling</h3>
<p>I'm in love with nature's magnificence and I love stories and storytelling.Working with our design team, each of those passions+inspirations are infused into the sock's designs. As a television journalist, I wanted each design to express a deeper story that all ties back to love. I think it makes each pair more meaningful, purposeful and intentional.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480962985/obr66zbpb6mpmk5odr4g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Purpose, intent+love- each of those elements is evident in the socks. From the heart logo on the heel, to the super-soft Bamboo threads in each pair, and the vibrant, fun designs, SoleMate Sox is the stress-free sensible way to make your day! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481351946/ofaqcioapcdmu20of65t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div><p> </p></div>","SoleMate Sox- MatchMaker For Lost Socks
 
Born From Frustration+Love
Hey everyone! I'm Catenya McHenry, inventor of SoleMate Sox magnetic socks. How many of you have lost socks? Unless you live on a remote island in the South Pacific (take me there), you probably have a sack of singles just hoping their sock mate will come back. SoleMate Sox is the solution for lost socks.
This idea of SoleMate Sox was born from raw frustration! Nearly every morning, one of my three children, is running down the hall yelling they have no socks, let alone matching pairs, free of holes in the toes. I kept thinking there had to be something on the market that held socks together but I found nothing, online and in stores!! I know, I was just as shocked too because the sock industry is a billion dollar empire.
What started as a homemade solution at my kitchen table just to figure out if I could actually invent a fix, turned into hundreds of research hours, design+strategy meetings with engineers, magnet behavior experiments, visits to sock manufacturers, fabric research, several prototypes, sock samples, magnet testing sessions, and nearly 2 1/2 years of development. All of that has lead patent-pending amazing technology to keep your socks from being single forever.


The technology,  functionality+practicality is one thing, design+comfort is another. I had to make sure to create socks that were far from bleh+ boring- that people would actually be excited to slip on or break glass ceilings in.


Love in Design+Storytelling
I'm in love with nature's magnificence and I love stories and storytelling.Working with our design team, each of those passions+inspirations are infused into the sock's designs. As a television journalist, I wanted each design to express a deeper story that all ties back to love. I think it makes each pair more meaningful, purposeful and intentional.
 
Purpose, intent+love- each of those elements is evident in the socks. From the heart logo on the heel, to the super-soft Bamboo threads in each pair, and the vibrant, fun designs, SoleMate Sox is the stress-free sensible way to make your day! 

Better Quality
Our first production run was doable and we sold lots of socks but I wanted to amp up our quality. I went back to the drawing board, spending months studying, researching+ testing comfortable threads and fabrics to manufacture the best possible longer-lasting pairs. My goal was to explore more eco-friendly, materials. That's when I learned about the benefits of bamboo.

It turns out, bamboo is incredibly beneficial! It's not only eco-friendly and sustainable, growing super fast without pesticides and human intervention but its threads are stronger than cotton, softer, breathable, and moisture-wicking.

<h3><b>Problems </b></h3>
<p>Climate
change challenges vis-à-vis carbon emissions is an issue we constantly combat. Besides
using huge fossil energy, it also brings along massive environment destruction
which are irreversible. </p>
<p>We
have 2 daily challenges: unfortunately many underdeveloped countries are still
shortages of electricity &amp; a missed opportunity to tap energy from
unconventional sources. </p>
<p>Without a well-built electrical system, these off grid areas are
experiencing a lower quality of life as compare to others. Until year 2030, the
percentage of people without electricity will be at an astounding 10%.  Our Speedy is akin to a standalone power barge

<p></p>
<p>In addition, ""By my
very rough estimate, residential, commercial, and industrial air conditioning
worldwide consumes at least one trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity
annually."" reported Stan Cox, Yale environment 360, Jul 12.  Speedy can recover this energy from these
unconventional sources.</p>
<p> As such, our products are dedicated to meet
the needs by providing</p>
<p>1) Renewable clean energy
that are environmentally friendly. </p>
<p>2) Off-grid village so as
to enhance their quality of life.</p>
<p>3) Better utilization of
existing electricity. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Conceptualization</b></h3>
<p>Speedy wind turbine started off as a joint
collaboration between our Commercialization Team and FYP Roy Sng and Supervisor
William Phay of SIM University. William who is also the founder of the
initiatives sees that this technology has more potential to tackle climate
change challenges.  Together as a team,
we conceptualized our idea of utilizing this wind turbine for underdeveloped
countries &amp; urbanized cities.  To date,
we have developed a wind farm of 20 Speedy in Singapore. It has been running
for &gt; 2 years.  As such, we intend to
embark on this adventure to build and test-bed the efficiency of a larger 5kW
turbine so that more energy can be produced. The success would mean that the
turbine can be deployed in places that need it most.   </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Speedy</b></h3>
<p>How special is Speedy? How different is Speedy from
the remaining turbines in the market? In this section we will reveal the
interesting concept that leads to the birth of Speedy and its awesome benefits.
Firstly, the product is real and the team is real.  Speedy is NOT a 3D toy but real stuff that
save money for you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445222596/uwrxptftuyicntgqz9yt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Secondly, Speedy is more effective.  It’s a misconception that wind will hit the
turbine blades at a similar speed  &amp;
perpendicularly. </p>
<p>In reality, varying seasonal conditions &amp; uneven
ground/building conditions means that the wind needs to “navigate” through
obstacles and rebounding off grounds before colliding with a turbine. As such,
the interaction of the wind and a turbine blade is never uniform. Perhaps, more
wind at the bottom than the top blade. </p>
<p>You have more control to catch the wind now! The team
has developed a stackable, staggered 3 blades wind turbine.</p>
<p>Speedy
is a stack-able, staggered blades wind turbines. During the summer you can
adjust 2 long aligned blades down offset with a 1 blade top. During the winter,
perhaps 1 blade down and 2 long aligned blades top. Compare to the convention
one long continuous blade turbine which carries a heavy weight, each layer@Speedy
can now spin at its optimum efficiency. In this case, we will be fully
utilizing the wind energy. </p>
<p> Better still, buy two sets and join them
together for a 9 blades system.  You can
play with different combinations to catch the best power.  You may even paste your favorite photos on
the blades. </p>
<p>Compare
to the convention one blade turbine which carries a heavy weight, each layer
can now spin at its optimum efficiency. In this case, we will be fully utilizing
the wind energy. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445222760/g1jma8a57bftk7xnyzta.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Performance is backed by a tunnel test. A triple stacked Speedy can start to generate
electricity at a mere 5 m/s wind and produce an extraordinary voltage of 65
volt at a wind speed of 15 m/s. 40% more efficient than a common 4 blades
turbine in the market!!!  Add a
gear-ratio-multiplier and Speedy can spin at low speed now. Try it out!!!</div><div><p>Thirdly, the triple stacked Speedy has won the 2015 Energy Innovation
Challenge hosted by Institute of Engineer Singapore. Judges were totally impressed
by our concept and efficiency output!</p></div><div>

<p>Lastly,
our design team valued added Speedy with the concept of “FFS”- Feasibility,
Flexibility &amp; Sustainability. With these 3 points, Speedy can be easily
catered to different sizes and configurations for a wide novel applications
that are suited for every individual consumers at a cheap price with the least
harm to the environment. </p>

<h3><b>Purpose</b></h3>
<p>One
Dollar of Joy would like to bring a 5000 W Speedy to a offgrid community in
Sihanoukville, Cambodia or Hanoi,Vietnam, etc. We call this a “one-$-wind”.  However, we need to be sure that it works
efficiently first. Thus, through Indiegogo &amp; yourself, we hope to raise
enough money for the future implementation of 5000 W Speedy. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Future
&amp; Beyond</b></h3>
<p>Other
than a turbine, we have plans for an imminent “Joybus” project to be launch
soon.  It is an integrated mobile
wastewater treatment system. Now that we have gained the support of the local
authority, this project is the next to go. 
Speedy provides the energy to run this wastewater treatment plant. If
this campaign is successful, we will build the 5000 W turbine, embark on the
Joybus campaign and solicit our backers as volunteers for the community
project. We envision a stay at the village for a period of 3-5 days to conduct
infrastructure &amp; education works on environment protections, toilet
trainings and basic hygiene.  Some of you
may be interested in conducting English class too.  </p>

<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3> <p></p>
<p>To bring
sustainable

 technology to off-grid villages &amp; smart cities. Through the use of technology, we will
like to enhance the quality of life for people in these underdeveloped regions &amp; to ""cool a warming planet"".
As such, we plead for your support in this campaign, help us chase our dream
and be part of the family to realize it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3> <p> </p>
<p>It is always a constant
challenge to balance the cost and efficiency of a wind turbine. The team always
wanted an affordable, sustainable and capable product for everyone. As such
there is always a continuous effort in bringing the cost down. Over the months,
we have searched through various manufacturing avenues and methods and finally
we found the right recipe for a cost efficient turbine. </p>
<p>However, mass
manufacturing of wind turbines may required some time if our project is successfully funded. Thus we have set the estimated delivery date to be 3
months from end of project to gain some time allowance. We will be also looking
for alternative manufacturer if the production process is delayed. We believe
with these two measures, the risk will be overcome. </p>
<h3><b>International Shipping</b></h3>
<div>
<p>The team have always
wanted to bring in affordable turbine to everyone. As much as we will like to
include free shipping in our rewards, we face many constraints in doing this. <b>As such, any shipping outside of Singapore
will be payable by  backers.  Backers will need to arrange for your own package pick up and shipping service.</b> However, we can also
liaise with you on suitable shipping agency or courier service for your locations too. We seek your understanding in this matter.  Thank you, Ambassador Champions. Once all is done,
you will receive our lovely turbine at your doorsteps in weeks!!! Information our our turbine are shown below to help you get a good quote on the shipping fees. </p>

1) Renewable clean energy
that are environmentally friendly. 
2) Off-grid village so as
to enhance their quality of life.
3) Better utilization of
existing electricity. 


Conceptualization
Speedy wind turbine started off as a joint
collaboration between our Commercialization Team and FYP Roy Sng and Supervisor
William Phay of SIM University. William who is also the founder of the
initiatives sees that this technology has more potential to tackle climate
change challenges.  Together as a team,
we conceptualized our idea of utilizing this wind turbine for underdeveloped
countries & urbanized cities.  To date,
we have developed a wind farm of 20 Speedy in Singapore. It has been running
for > 2 years.  As such, we intend to
embark on this adventure to build and test-bed the efficiency of a larger 5kW
turbine so that more energy can be produced. The success would mean that the
turbine can be deployed in places that need it most.   



Speedy
How special is Speedy? How different is Speedy from
the remaining turbines in the market? In this section we will reveal the
interesting concept that leads to the birth of Speedy and its awesome benefits.
Firstly, the product is real and the team is real.  Speedy is NOT a 3D toy but real stuff that
save money for you. 

Secondly, Speedy is more effective.  It’s a misconception that wind will hit the
turbine blades at a similar speed  &
perpendicularly. 
In reality, varying seasonal conditions & uneven
ground/building conditions means that the wind needs to “navigate” through
obstacles and rebounding off grounds before colliding with a turbine. As such,
the interaction of the wind and a turbine blade is never uniform. Perhaps, more
wind at the bottom than the top blade. 
You have more control to catch the wind now! The team
has developed a stackable, staggered 3 blades wind turbine.
Speedy
is a stack-able, staggered blades wind turbines. During the summer you can
adjust 2 long aligned blades down offset with a 1 blade top. During the winter,
perhaps 1 blade down and 2 long aligned blades top. Compare to the convention
one long continuous blade turbine which carries a heavy weight, each layer@Speedy
can now spin at its optimum efficiency. In this case, we will be fully
utilizing the wind energy. 
 Better still, buy two sets and join them
together for a 9 blades system.  You can
play with different combinations to catch the best power.  You may even paste your favorite photos on
the blades. 
Compare
to the convention one blade turbine which carries a heavy weight, each layer
can now spin at its optimum efficiency. In this case, we will be fully utilizing
the wind energy. 
Performance is backed by a tunnel test. A triple stacked Speedy can start to generate
electricity at a mere 5 m/s wind and produce an extraordinary voltage of 65
volt at a wind speed of 15 m/s. 40% more efficient than a common 4 blades
turbine in the market!!!  Add a
gear-ratio-multiplier and Speedy can spin at low speed now. Try it out!!!Thirdly, the triple stacked Speedy has won the 2015 Energy Innovation
Challenge hosted by Institute of Engineer Singapore. Judges were totally impressed
by our concept and efficiency output!




Lastly,
our design team valued added Speedy with the concept of “FFS”- Feasibility,
Flexibility & Sustainability. With these 3 points, Speedy can be easily
catered to different sizes and configurations for a wide novel applications
that are suited for every individual consumers at a cheap price with the least
harm to the environment. 


The turbine has been featured in the following UniSIM and Today Newspaper. 




Purpose
One
Dollar of Joy would like to bring a 5000 W Speedy to a offgrid community in
Sihanoukville, Cambodia or Hanoi,Vietnam, etc. We call this a “one-$-wind”.  However, we need to be sure that it works
efficiently first. Thus, through Indiegogo & yourself, we hope to raise
enough money for the future implementation of 5000 W Speedy. 


Future
& Beyond
Other
than a turbine, we have plans for an imminent “Joybus” project to be launch
soon.  It is an integrated mobile
wastewater treatment system. Now that we have gained the support of the local
authority, this project is the next to go. 
Speedy provides the energy to run this wastewater treatment plant. If
this campaign is successful, we will build the 5000 W turbine, embark on the
Joybus campaign and solicit our backers as volunteers for the community
project. We envision a stay at the village for a period of 3-5 days to conduct
infrastructure & education works on environment protections, toilet
trainings and basic hygiene.  Some of you
may be interested in conducting English class too.  
Can
u help us?  Let’s unite to fight climate
change, provide for underdeveloped countries and to live wise in smart cities
and also save money for you

The Impact 
To bring
sustainable

 technology to off-grid villages & smart cities. Through the use of technology, we will
like to enhance the quality of life for people in these underdeveloped regions & to ""cool a warming planet"".
As such, we plead for your support in this campaign, help us chase our dream
and be part of the family to realize it. 

Risks & Challenges  
It is always a constant
challenge to balance the cost and efficiency of a wind turbine. The team always
wanted an affordable, sustainable and capable product for everyone. As such
there is always a continuous effort in bringing the cost down. Over the months,
we have searched through various manufacturing avenues and methods and finally
we found the right recipe for a cost efficient turbine. 
However, mass
manufacturing of wind turbines may required some time if our project is successfully funded. Thus we have set the estimated delivery date to be 3
months from end of project to gain some time allowance. We will be also looking
for alternative manufacturer if the production process is delayed. We believe
with these two measures, the risk will be overcome. 
International Shipping

The team have always
wanted to bring in affordable turbine to everyone. As much as we will like to
include free shipping in our rewards, we face many constraints in doing this. As such, any shipping outside of Singapore
will be payable by  backers.  Backers will need to arrange for your own package pick up and shipping service. However, we can also
liaise with you on suitable shipping agency or courier service for your locations too. We seek your understanding in this matter.  Thank you, Ambassador Champions. Once all is done,
you will receive our lovely turbine at your doorsteps in weeks!!! Information our our turbine are shown below to help you get a good quote on the shipping fees. 


For exporting out of Singapore, we suggest Speedpost to our supporters. Estimated shipping fee from Singapore to New York for 50 W and 100 W turbine is around USD 92 and USD 137 respectively.  
Speedpost is  http://www.speedpost.com.sg/.

Permaculture at Home


This project seeks to give small-scale farmers in southwestern Uganda the basic means and culturally-relevant education to design and install their own Permaculture Gardens:

Permaculture means: perma / culture, or ""permanent culture"". It's a holistic design approach to living sustainably on the land. This is what Ugandan farmers have been doing for centuries, but due to colonialism and unjust markets, there's been a break-down in traditional knowledge practices. It's also difficult to afford materials to kick-start permaculture systems. We want to put knowledge and training back into the hands of small-scale farmers.

Our goals:


Improve food production & reduce child malnutrition
Generate income for household needs & school fees
Increase access to water & save women time
Help farmers become more efficient & productive



   Water + Trees + Rabbits  This project will provide 10 identified families in Kabale, Uganda with support to kick-start permaculture systems at home. This project will provide each family with the following:



1. Rainwater catchment + underground water storage for 6000 litres

<h3>The Benefits for Nobot Owners</h3>Our goal, with Nobot, is for every Nobot-owning individual, household or organisation to get more out of each day of their lives because of their Nobot.<br/><br/><p>Nobot N1H1 is our launch device, a general purpose humanoid.  </p>
<p>With this, and our subsequent, more specialist Nobots, the goal is that so many aspects of personal and business life and activity can be improved - if only because of the opportunity costs involved - by using Nobot.</p>
<p>At this point prior to launch we are busy building out partnerships and accessory packs (see below).  As things stand, even the base-level N1H1 unit is able to do a hundred and one things:</p>

The Story Behind Nobot
When I was at school, we grew up with the (myth?) that NASA spent millions on a pen that could write in zero gravity, whereas the Russians issued their cosmonauts with pencils.We have seen enough robot fail videos to know artificial intelligence (AI) isn't easy.We also figured that there are perhaps a billion or more under-utilised minds in the world that could be much more powerful than any AI ever made.  Sure, they might not all become a chess grandmaster, but in terms of common-sense and the ability to learn quickly the human mind takes some beating.

Operators' Marketplace
The Nobot Operators' Marketplace allows a huge variety of people the world over to work in better conditions, for better pay than they could locally, but without having to emigrate.This is hugely beneficial for the individuals concerned - they get the benefits of better work, based in the country that they love - but also massively positive for the countries concerned as there is not a 'brain drain'.The Nobot Operators' Marketplace will be open to all, but also underpinned by a series of operator centres that we intend to set up around the world for Nobot operators who may otherwise not have the requisite hardware.Our first Operator Centres will be in:

The Technology behind Nobot
Nobot uses some really great, but tried-and-tested technology.The Nobot N1H1 device itself is relatively low-tech.  It is a mix of tried and tested hardware (camera, servos, Raspberry Pi, 3G dongle, etc) inside a study ABS plastic container.We aspire to have a Nobot in every home and every business.  To do this, we couldn't make it cost a million dollars.  As such, we have taken best of breed technology, often from the VR space, and made it work for Nobot.For example, this include:

</p><p>My name is Joshua Hensley and I am the inventor of the
Operator Survival Tool (O.S.T.). My patent pending invention is a survival
multi-tool that was designed to help people when they need it most. </p>
<p>As a law enforcement officer, hunter and avid outdoorsman, I
know how easy it is to find yourself unprepared in a difficult and dangerous
situation. It was with this in mind that I created the O.S.T.</p>
<p>The O.S.T. is a tool designed to fulfill what I believe to
be the three most basic needs in a survival situation. </p>
<p>The first and most important is the
ability to keep your main tool of defense (in this case an Ar15), clean and
operational. The O.S.T. has within it a stainless steel scraper tool that can aid in the
disassembly and cleaning of the critical surfaces on the Ar15’s bolt, bolt carrier
and firing pin. The scraper tool also has the ability to turn screwdriver
bits for tightening scope mounts, open bottle tops and more. </p>
<p>The second most important and
universal need for survival, is fire. The O.S.T. has a flint rod and steel
within, allowing it to produce sparks and create fire despite any weather
conditions. The O.S.T. housing becomes a handle for the flint rod.  </p>
<p>A third important aspect of the
O.S.T. is a textured steel sharpening rod. The O.S.T. housing also becomes the handle for the sharpening rod. A sharp knife, scissors or hatchet can go a long
way to improving one’s odds of survival. 
</p>
<p>The reason the O.S.T. can be so effective,
is its shape. It is an injected molded polymer designed to fit within the common battery compartments on
Ar15 furniture (Pistol grips, Forward grips and Butt Stocks). You can now place
the O.S.T. in your Ar15 and always have three critical aspects of survival with
you at all times.  </p>
<p>The reason I am here accepting donations for my cause, is
that I am trying to achieve the American dream, while at the same time, creating
a superior product. I am trying to create a company from nothing more than an
idea for a new product. I’m trying to make my product of quality materials and
make them efficiently. The only way I know how to do that is to have custom
molds made that allow me to make a quality product at a reasonable price point. I’m learning
quickly that molds are very expensive. </p>
<p>All funds gathered here will go directly towards the custom molds needed
and producing the first run of O.S.T. tools. Once the molds are made I feel that I can produce
relatively small batches and sell them locally to grow my business slowly. </p>

<p>EcoCrafting is a new start-up company specializing in environmentally friendly and future-oriented solutions in residential construction.</p>
<p>When our company is up and running, our vision is to build houses in developing countries. We intend on teaching individuals in these countries to build their own houses using environmentally-friendly, locally grown resources. This will create workplaces, housing, growth, and prosperity.</p>
<p>We are starting a pilot project with ""Biocrete"" a biological concrete that has yet to be used in Norway. In today’s construction industry, there's a growing need for energy efficient buildings. However, this often comes at the expense of price and indoor climate. Poor air quality indoors has detrimental effects on both our physical and cognitive health-- It's been proven by researchers at top universities such as Stanford, Harvard, and Yale!</p>
<p>Why pay hundreds of thousands of Euros (NOK) for a house that is toxic for you and your family's health? The current construction method uses materials that aren't environmentally friendly, or even ""people"" friendly, for that matter. This is something we NEED to change!</p>
<p>Our wall system brings competing u-values and a superior indoor heating/cooling system, ensuring that the temperature of your home is regulated at a fraction of the cost of a ""regular"" house. It's also fire resistant, pest resistant, mould resistant, earthquake resistant and has great acoustic insulation!</p>
<p>Our homes will compete with traditional construction prices while utilizing environmentally friendly materials. The finished construction will have a negative carbon footprint-- This is because Biocrete traps and consumes CO2 in the atmosphere. In fact, the CO2 helps the Biocrete become stronger and solidified, making your new home as environmentally resistant as it is friendly!</p>
<p>These modern homes will be elegantly designed with smart, user-friendly technology--A true home of the future! It will produce clean energy that the owner can sell to their neighbors, or better yet, to the community. Imagine making a profit while saving the planet!</p>
<p>Please support our project and help us steer the construction industry into a more sustainable, healthy and environmentally friendly direction. Change starts small, but we hope that someday, we'll be able to provide EcoCrafted homes to millions of people.</p>

<p>I am a mom of two young girls who prefer my home-cooked meals over school lunches and boring sandwiches. After trying several thermoses on the market, I couldn't find anything that stayed hot long enough, and would allow me to send a side dish along with a main dish in the same container. I found myself daydreaming of making a product that would do just that, but never imagined it would be possible. I wouldn't know where to begin...  Suddenly I remembered that I have a friend who is a product designer. After seeking her advice, I decided to turn my daydream into a reality. After all, many people have ideas, very few act on them. I wanted to be one that ACTS on it. For months, after full days of work, and sending the kids off to bed  I poured myself into research and development. I learned the process one step at a time. I took a crash course in business and marketing. I kept everything a secret from friends and family until the long awaited sample products were delivered to my door (just in case). I had done it!  It was beautiful! And most importantly it worked!! Of course I am only half way to realizing my dream of being an entrepreneur, and product developer. With the help of backers I will be able to pay for molds, marketing and branding, begin production, and order enough quantity to launch the product in two countries just in time for back to school (mid August 2017).  Our family takes a trip to India twice a year, and have decided that for every unit of product sold, we will feed a family in need. If you are compelled to contribute at this time, I graciously thank you. Also, please take the time to share this with as many people as you can.</p>

I had done it!  It was beautiful! And most importantly it worked!! Of course I am only half way to realizing my dream of being an entrepreneur, and product developer. With the help of backers I will be able to pay for molds, marketing and branding, begin production, and order enough quantity to launch the product in two countries just in time for back to school (mid August 2017).  Our family takes a trip to India twice a year, and have decided that for every unit of product sold, we will feed a family in need. If you are compelled to contribute at this time, I graciously thank you. Also, please take the time to share this with as many people as you can.
Sincerely,
Tina McGonagill

 Locate a stud inside the wall near your toilet seat with convenient arm reach to mount your unit.


 Line up your Pack N' Roll dispenser unit perfectly straight and balanced, and make sure the four (4) holes align with the center of the wall stud.

Mark the four (4) holes on your wall for the screws.

Screw in the top hole screw first, and then screw in the bottom hole screw next, and make sure the dispenser is straight and centered before tightening.


Screw in the two (2) middle screws and make sure your unit is tight and steady on the wall before loading your rolls.
