<p>  Award-Winning Master Chef and Athlete, Shashank Agtey, has fused his love of cooking healthy, clean, nutritious food with his long-running interest in athletics and training by systematically creating a line of All-Natural, GMO-Free, Gluten-Free Energy Bars specifically designed to Supply, Sustain, and Refuel Energy for your workout.</p>
<p>An “All-American” athlete, Shashank began running over 45 years ago and excelled in the sport. He continues to exemplify a healthy lifestyle through regular participation in marathons all over South Florida. After years of eating energy bars, he decided it was time to create a set of nutritious energy bars with three extraordinarily phenomenal tastes. Each bar is specifically formulated to enhance the performance and experience of working out. The Hop bar supplies energy, the Step bar sustains energy, and the Jump bar refuels energy. </p>
<p> This is Shasank’s opportunity to show people what energy bars should taste like. They are made with the highest quality ingredients incorporating power ingredients and super foods such as Bee Pollen, Maca Powder, Chia Seeds, Cardamom, and more. There are no alcohol sugars in any of the bars and every ingredient is folded in - the bee pollen is not crushed, the almonds are whole, the chia seeds are whole, and so on. </p>
<p>Hop Step Jump will use the funds to produce and manufacture the bars for a wholesale and retail basis targeting fitness, culinary, nutrition, and health food based national chains as well as local businesses. Hop Step Jump will be available on the website (<a href=""http://www.hopstepjumpenergybars/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.HopStepJumpEnergyBars</a>) for ecommerce sales. The brand would also sponsor athletic events and participate in running, obstacle course, and other sports/training related activities. </p>
<p>Chef Shashank is an active participant in the South Florida area as an avid promoter for various charities. Keeping in line with the spirit of giving back, Hop Step Jump is currently partnered with the University of Florida’s Honey Bee Research &amp; Extension Lab. Shashank plans for proceeds from Hop Step Jump sales to go directly to helping the honey bee, an integral part of our ecosystem that is currently in trouble. By giving back to UF’s HBREL, Hop Step Jump will help them aim to improve the health and productivity of honey bee colonies in Florida and globally by investing in research projects focusing on honey bee husbandry, ecology, behavior, and conservation.</p>

Your help, support, and drive can impact us in many valuable ways, and it is our hope you will take that leap. Our goal is to raise $40,000.00 that will be used across three phases to ultimately arrive at an application solution that creates empowerment and ownership of a lifelong condition. Phase one: develop our beta tool and further test and iterate to gather more data. Phase two: begin defining the key requirements and regulation challenges for a secure, Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant integration. Phase three: work with a collaborating medical staff to prototype and conceptualize our doctor dashboard. We have a plan for success. We have started the work and established a network of medical professionals who are eager to see this succeed. Now, we need you. You can support our endeavor of patient empowerment in key fundamental ways. Our Team The WHYSimon Sinek famously said in his TEDx Talk, “People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.” Our WHY is simple, we believe that design can play a central role in changing the lives of those with chronic conditions to live better, longer lives. This effort started out focused on psoriasis, but as we spoke with patients, caregivers, advocates, and doctors we realized that it’s much bigger than that. While an estimated 7.5 million Americans (National Psoriasis Foundation) live with psoriasis, there are more than 40 million people who live with skin or cancer related conditions. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 87,000 will be diagnosed with some form of cancerous melanoma on their skin with 1 in 5 adults developing it. Your support is going to have direct impact on how those patients manage care and conditions by giving them the complete transformation and experiencing of life. Key Risks & Key Challenges What if We don’t Succeed? That’s okay. Whatever we do raise will go directly to achieving our Phase 1 goals and further working on Dermitrax. If at first you don’t succeed, try, try (and try!) again. Our team will persist and we will endeavor to find a way to finish the development of the patient-focused application while re-defining our timeline for the larger challenges. To Learn More VisitClick the buttons below to learn more about Carevena, Dermitrax, and mobile health.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

I'm a certified Project Manager with an academic background in technology and economics. </p>

<p>I'm currently working fulltime in a niche that has been, for the last 10 years, deemed non-innovative, over-saturated and flooded by masses of free competition that is sometimes even better than the paid one. It can't get any worse but i like a challenge. Aside from this, i am working on a simplified Theory of Everything - Both have lots of math and logic, i like that stuff. </p>
<p>I want to be able to continously focus on the development of the product. It has recently achieved a stable and reliable build and received a couple of thumbs up here and there. We did some giveaways at sharewareonsale.com and giveawayofhteday.com. It's free to download and you can check it out yourself right now @ <a href=""http://download.bulkzip.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://download.bulkzip.com</a> (7MB, 32Bit/64Bit).</p>
<p>There is also a full product data sheet available @ <a href=""http://www.bulkzip.com/pdf/product_sheet.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bulkzip.com/pdf/product_sheet.pdf</a> describing, what is existing already. I think its good to show you that me and my team get things done and accomplished.</p>
<p>Behind the project is the drive for perfection.  I was also very dissatsified with the existing products and came to project my own solution towards an optimum file compression and archiving tool. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Here is a small video on BulkZip:</span></p>

<div>With the money raised, i want to extend BulkZip in a way, that it is not only <b>stronger in the horizontal </b>(=support of more file formats), but <b>also in the vertical </b>(=compression related features). </div><div><br/></div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Extend it in the horizontal</b></h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I want to add first and foremost read/extract support for around ~</span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">55 exotic formats.</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> We already support the extraction of 35 file formats and would then support</span><b style=""background-color: initial;""> in total a stunning 90 file formats</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - something no archiver ever managed to do. PeaZip claims to support 150+ formats, but that is a vastly inflated number as they count reading Microsoft Word files and others that are not really compressors in a more closer sense. They also count extensions double, e.g. GZ and TAR.GZ; so their claim is not serious. I'am serious about that file format support. My aim is to effectivly abolish all these other archivers like WinRAR, 7Zip and WinZip and to create </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">that </i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">one very tailored tool that has it all and that everybody deems the best software in the niche. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">These 55 ""new"" formats are mainly old, exotic and cross-application file types like Amiga, ROM/Chip Formats, CD/DVD formats coming from thr MS-DOS era, are System/Disk Drive related or from the old Usenet days. It's not easy to implement them, as many are nearly dead or specialist for them are very rare. We have a sophisticated C# interface that allows us quick and easy integration of a format once we have access to a source or command line tool. It is nearly independent on the initial coding language. In terms of copyright, proprietary format holders are required by EU and US law to give way to the distribution of a limited <i>access solution</i> for their file format. That covers exactly what we want to do (Read/Extract). </span><br/>
</div>
<div>We did research on the top 30 file archivers and compressors (WinRAR, BandiZip, IZArc, WinZip etc.) and figured that eventually each of them supports 1-3 of these exotic formats, but none does all. We want to make it easy and that a user can access every file, no matter how rare its type is:</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Philipp and im currently developing a file compression utility called ""BulkZip"", located @ http://www.bulkzip.com. I'm a certified Project Manager with an academic background in technology and economics. 

I'm currently working fulltime in a niche that has been, for the last 10 years, deemed non-innovative, over-saturated and flooded by masses of free competition that is sometimes even better than the paid one. It can't get any worse but i like a challenge. Aside from this, i am working on a simplified Theory of Everything - Both have lots of math and logic, i like that stuff. 
I want to be able to continously focus on the development of the product. It has recently achieved a stable and reliable build and received a couple of thumbs up here and there. We did some giveaways at sharewareonsale.com and giveawayofhteday.com. It's free to download and you can check it out yourself right now @ http://download.bulkzip.com (7MB, 32Bit/64Bit).
There is also a full product data sheet available @ http://www.bulkzip.com/pdf/product_sheet.pdf describing, what is existing already. I think its good to show you that me and my team get things done and accomplished.
Behind the project is the drive for perfection.  I was also very dissatsified with the existing products and came to project my own solution towards an optimum file compression and archiving tool. Here is a small video on BulkZip:

... and here are some screenshots:The Plan
With the money raised, i want to extend BulkZip in a way, that it is not only stronger in the horizontal (=support of more file formats), but also in the vertical (=compression related features). 
Extend it in the horizontal

I want to add first and foremost read/extract support for around ~55 exotic formats. We already support the extraction of 35 file formats and would then support in total a stunning 90 file formats - something no archiver ever managed to do. PeaZip claims to support 150+ formats, but that is a vastly inflated number as they count reading Microsoft Word files and others that are not really compressors in a more closer sense. They also count extensions double, e.g. GZ and TAR.GZ; so their claim is not serious. I'am serious about that file format support. My aim is to effectivly abolish all these other archivers like WinRAR, 7Zip and WinZip and to create that one very tailored tool that has it all and that everybody deems the best software in the niche. These 55 ""new"" formats are mainly old, exotic and cross-application file types like Amiga, ROM/Chip Formats, CD/DVD formats coming from thr MS-DOS era, are System/Disk Drive related or from the old Usenet days. It's not easy to implement them, as many are nearly dead or specialist for them are very rare. We have a sophisticated C# interface that allows us quick and easy integration of a format once we have access to a source or command line tool. It is nearly independent on the initial coding language. In terms of copyright, proprietary format holders are required by EU and US law to give way to the distribution of a limited access solution for their file format. That covers exactly what we want to do (Read/Extract). 

We did research on the top 30 file archivers and compressors (WinRAR, BandiZip, IZArc, WinZip etc.) and figured that eventually each of them supports 1-3 of these exotic formats, but none does all. We want to make it easy and that a user can access every file, no matter how rare its type is:

The Impact

 In the long run we want to build a well balanced product that is regarded as ""the best"" in multiple criteria regarding speed, strength, usability and feature density. We want that the recognition of the saying ""to RAR"" or ""to ZIP"" something, gets slowly associated with our tool. It's not impossible, but it will take at least a few years from now on. If we get the proper funding (we do not require that much) we will  make it happen.   
Risks & Challenges We have the typical risk of software development: Incompatibilities, need for reverse engineering, bugs, bugs, bugs. Currently the challenge is money to buy food and pay for shelter. There is a likelyhood that we might completely fail, but that is eventually in everything there is.

<p>I love making people feel good about themselves which is why I went to school to be a cosmetologist. However that wasn't the path that I wanted to take. What I loved doing was making candles and body products that were safe for all types of skin...but also affordable for most people.</p>
<p>Of course that means research...research and more research. After all the research and knowledge becomes the next step of actually producing this great product...but keeping a high quality. What does that take of course...money.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What's it gonna' take?</h3> <p>I've always been a bargain hunter...coupons, sales and deal have never been an issue. Those are how you stretch the all-mighty dollar. Of course to have a high quality product you're going to need higher quality ingredients.

</div></div>","Why Me? Why This Campaign? Most people wish they were in a career field that they love...however most of us have a hard time getting there. When you have the chance to do what you love and make a difference...you sometimes have to take the risk and dive head first!
I love making people feel good about themselves which is why I went to school to be a cosmetologist. However that wasn't the path that I wanted to take. What I loved doing was making candles and body products that were safe for all types of skin...but also affordable for most people.
Of course that means research...research and more research. After all the research and knowledge becomes the next step of actually producing this great product...but keeping a high quality. What does that take of course...money.   What's it gonna' take? I've always been a bargain hunter...coupons, sales and deal have never been an issue. Those are how you stretch the all-mighty dollar. Of course to have a high quality product you're going to need higher quality ingredients. Due to my great sense of bargains I have found great deals on quality ingredients...that not even big brand companies use...but still will provide a profit.

almost 1% of the world's population have epilepsy
30% of people with epilepsy do not respond to medical treatment
1 out of 7 people with epilepsy suffer from difficult to notice absence seizures
Absences are silent epileptic seizures that are really, really difficult to notice. This makes it challenging for parents to report seizure frequency to medical professionals. But it is especially tough in the classroom for child and teacher.

Slim headset sends brain activity to the smartphone.
The Epihunter app detects absence seizures and turns on the smartphone light.
Seizure length is displayed to inform child if preferred.

Teacher is aware of seizures and can react appropriately.

Objective data on seizures is stored to provide insights to parents.
  ​StartIt@KBC DemoDay 2017 Pitch by Tim (father of child with absence seizures) about Epihunter.Supportive intro by Erik Janssen (Head of Innovative Solutions - UCB)(subtitles available)  Press coverage Evening news TV - één (in Dutch) More on VRT NWSMorning radio - Radio 1 (in Dutch) Interview with Tim More on website Radio 1Kids TV - Karrewiet (in Dutch) Daan about his epilepsy See on website KarrewietStaring versus Absence seizuresMostly we imagine very visible muscle and body movements when we think about epilepsy. Absence seizures - also called non-motor seizures or ""petits-mals"" - are much more difficult to notice in daily life. The person will simply stare, react in slow motion and stop movements. Seizures can last from a few seconds to several minutes. Some of the differences with ""staring"" are highlighted below:Back to the topBack to the top

Can I use Epihunter Classroom if my child has motor seizures?Epihunter Classroom focuses only on the detection of absence seizures. If both motor and absence seizures occur, Epihunter will only detect and report on absence seizures.What's the cost for a consumer EEG headset and how does it look?We are currently testing multiple consumer EEG headsets. Prices typically range from €150-300. I'm an adult with absence seizures, can I also use Epihunter Classroom?Yes, Epihunter Classroom can also be used by adults at home, work or where you see valuable. Can Epihunter Classroom be used worldwide?Today, we primarily focus on European users, as this will allow us to provide you with the high quality user support you deserve. Nevertheless, we do not exclude users outside of Europe.Please note: The goal of Epihunter Classroom is to help children, their teachers and parents live better with absence seizures. Epihunter Classroom is not a medical device, and as such should not be used for medical purposes. Together with our partners, e.g. the Flemish Epilepsy Association, Epihunter is setting up clinical studies to gather the necessary evidence to expand our current solutions to medical use. Back to the top 
bijna 1% van de wereldbevolking heeft epilepsie
30% van de mensen met epilepsie reageren niet of nauwelijks op huidige medicatie
1 op 7 mensen met epilepsie heeft moeilijk op te merken absence aanvallen
Absences zijn stille epileptische aanvallen die echt heel moeilijk op te merken zijn. Dit maakt het een uitdaging voor ouders om de frequentie van aanvallen te rapporteren aan medische professionals. Maar het is vooral moeilijk in de klas, zowel voor het kind als voor de leerkracht.

Dunne headset stuurt hersenactiviteit naar de smartphone.

Epihunter app detecteert absence aanvallen en laat het smartphone lampje branden.
Lengte van aanval wordt getoond om kind te informeren indien gewenst.
De leerkracht is bewust van aanvallen en gepast reageren.​

As much training IUBI receives, while the kids are teaching him, the more he understands human needs and generates small challenges, every day, to learn more about the children habits. It can be about food, taking medicine, social interaction, exercises, or even IUBI can learn how to dance.The more IUBI is trained and get these interactions with the kids, the more he can evolve and customize the experience of his trainers. Children from 3 to 11 years old are the ideal trainers to IUBI. Together they grow up, they learn and get new challenges to improve their health. It can be to understand the difference between an apple and a chocolate, the time to take a shower, not forget to take the medicine, do exercises, socialize with friends and family.All the time that the kids open the App or interact with IUBI IoT they have a new experience with an increasingly evolved robotThe trainers will get points, pins and rewards that can be changed when IUBI get new updates. In the future, IUBI will include new features, functionalities and be. As much more he is trained, the more he evolves.❤ Every Physical update the user can use the own reward to purchase a new version. ❤ Gamifying kids routines to improve their healthGamification is a great way to teach users.Every experience counts to the user, who will get points, receive rewards and learn more about what can help and make them healthier.6 - 13 years old (the age range we're focusing our efforts)IUBI comes in 3 languages: English, Portuguese and Spanish As humans we have difficulties following routines. For kids this process grows with age, and this according to  the culture, region, education, social interaction, economic conditions, and others. We respect all differences and learn from every need. Healthy kids can use IUBI too, though IUBI has been designed for kids in treatment of chronic diseases, there isn’t restrictions or contraindications. If you still keep your inner child, we strongly recommend you to get your IUBI, feel free to buy your own IUBI! The science behind IUBIBehavior + Environment + Biological factorsBased on important PhD researches and studies involving patients treatment, patient centric, health routines, human behaviors and biological factors unified creating a powerful and unique source of science. IUBI is building as a platform to integrate others professionals, research and health solutions. In future, IUBI will integrate technology + science in a simple plug and play solution that parents, doctors, researches and kids can be benefit of different solutions align with IUBI purpose.The technology behind IUBIInternet Of Things + MobileFuncionalitiesSensors - IUBI can get the heart rate, oximetry (the amount of oxygen in the body) and body temperature; Children will collect these values to give IUBI energy.LEDs Each LED color will define a task on the routine or a need of treatment. For example: red is to take medicine, blue is to do the hygiene, green is time to eat, and so on.Conversation - IUBI can listen and talk to stimulate children to understand what they are feeling, have a clear view of their routines and the overall processes they are going through.Image Recognition - IUBI can interact with the child reality through the AR (augmented reality), here is where the kid teaches IUBI how the treatment happens and how it is their reality.

<p>Hi I knew that according to:  <a href=""http://www.ahrq.gov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ahrq.gov</a>  60,000 people die each year due to pressure ulcers, almost all of us had or will have a family member who could suffer painful ulcers capable of causing death, our project created a device that prevents the development of pressure ulcers, only in the United States 2.5 million people are affected every year according to the study of  <a href=""https://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/systems/hospital/pressureulcertoolkit/putool1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/systems/hosp...</a></p>
<p>I am an RN / MSN nurse and the most effective way we have to avoid pressure ulcers is exactly that, avoiding pressure on bony prominences, this must be done by changing the position patient every two hours, but the reality is that the nurses we are overloaded with work and we can not go every two hours to change all patients bedridden in position, it is impossible, (This hurts our backs a lot)</p>
<p>At other times, we educate family members about changes in the home for bedridden patients, but often they hurt their backs doing strength incorrectly, sometimes they do not have time to change their position every two hours and sometimes they forget</p>
<p>Our device is portable and very effective, is able to change people bedridden automatically every 2 hours or manually with just pressing two buttons, supports patient up to 600 pounds</p>

I am an RN / MSN nurse and the most effective way we have to avoid pressure ulcers is exactly that, avoiding pressure on bony prominences, this must be done by changing the position patient every two hours, but the reality is that the nurses we are overloaded with work and we can not go every two hours to change all patients bedridden in position, it is impossible, (This hurts our backs a lot)
At other times, we educate family members about changes in the home for bedridden patients, but often they hurt their backs doing strength incorrectly, sometimes they do not have time to change their position every two hours and sometimes they forget
Our device is portable and very effective, is able to change people bedridden automatically every 2 hours or manually with just pressing two buttons, supports patient up to 600 pounds

<p><strong>Short Summary: </strong></p>
<p>Hello! Would you like to be part of a Joyous Movement? I’m Beth Amine and as an author, speaker, visual artist, dancer, performer and self-expression specialist for nearly 50 years, I have personally seen thousands of people of all ages and walks of life come alive, heal disorders and create a deep connection to who they essentially are through the magic of art and movement programs. I witness miracles of renewed life daily in as diverse of populations as seniors with Alzheimer’s, executives, war veterans, children and just every day working folk.</p>
<p>This is purely from being shown through my classes, simple training programs and lifestyle coaching how to allow or inspire connection to this essential joyous core of our beings. Health, happiness, longevity and quality of life are all increased.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, through my work with elders of every age and ability, I have developed a highly effective, interactive group activity that engages even the most un-engage able of residents. I call it Joyous Movement. Individuals who do not speak will sing, and those who do not move become animated, breathe and move their hands and feet. This simple system of engagement through music, colorful props and the touch of the human heart also leaves caregivers and facilitators with the same sense of joy and fulfillment that can last the rest of the day or week.</p>
<p>The joyous results are so profound and heartwarming and the need is great in our elder communities, where individuals are often isolated and unresponsive. I have a deep desire to spread this simple system to retirement homes and residences through the county by training individuals to bring these simple techniques to every body and ability. The program is effective for Memory Care, Assisted and Independent Living.  In our successful proven training program, anyone interested can be taught how to facilitate this activity. Retirement residence life enrichment or activity directors are always in need of engaging events. In order to get these programs to all who can benefit and have our presence known in the larger community, we need funds for marketing, web work, office administration and promotional materials.</p>
<p>We also provide preventative lifestyle coaching through our Joyous Longevity programs. I have a new book on how to cultivate a long and happy life and a comprehensive business plan. As we all age, these programs are at the height of innovation as science proves the preventative and restorative capacity of music, movement and the arts. The largest benefit is that the human spirit is moved, revealed, and shared. My passion is inspiring joy, community celebration and a flourishing inner life and the vision is planetary!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>To get started, the funds will go towards monthly business expenses, rebranding, website systems creation, and new collateral materials.

<p>10,000 baby boomers are reaching retirement age every day and this trend will continue until 2030. Meeting the health, social and economic needs of this massive population is staggering.

More effective treatments such as those involving clinical services are not the most ideal for the everyday woman given their high up-keep cost with unsustainable results. An average of USD $200 per session with follow up visits every month are necessary to maintain the results.

That's why we came up with device that specifically helps women get rid of cellulites and firm up their legs at the same time. Utilising Electro Muscular Stimulation or EMS, this proven technology penetrates deep into the muscles to activate 90% of the muscles fibres and has been used as a fitness enhancement tool all over the world. EMS also targets cellulite directly as it prevents and reduces the development of cellulite by toning and tightening the muscles. It also promotes the circulation of blood flow and removes lymphatic drainage to achieve tight, seamless legs.It is a globally known fact that topical creams and LED light treatments are not very effective as these methods only target the surface of the skin and not within. More effective treatments such as those involving clinical services are not the most ideal for the everyday woman given their high up-keep cost with unsustainable results. An average of USD $200 per session with follow up visits every month are necessary to maintain the results. Taking these factors into consideration, we decided to invent a problem solving product that promises results, has a low up-keep cost and of course, affordable.Unlike conventional EMS technology where the product is hooked onto a wired console, our product is totally wireless. This seamless design fits like a second skin and provides a full range of movement and comfort. Embracing a positive body image, we have created a wide range of sizes and fitting to suit all body types. This anti-bacterial fabric is not only suitable for sensitive skin but produces high energy conductivity of the electrodes as well.The Aspire Pants has electrodes covering the abs, quads, hamstrings and glutes. The electrodes will target the different muscle groups by sending gentle impulses and working the problem areas by tightening connective tissues and reducing cellulite.All it takes is 3 steps to start using the product. Put on the Aspire Pants, power up the device and select your desired level of intensity. We recommended to use the product 3 times a week, with a duration of 30 minutes for each session.The Aspire Body Firming Gel is a natural toning amino acid to target problem areas from within, to smoothen and firm the skin. This anti-cellulite cream is enriched with activating properties to reduce the appearance of uneven skin texture. This product has undergone years of research and development and was made specifically to be the perfect pairing for use with the Aspire Pants. For optimal results, it is recommended to use both the gel and Aspire device together which will help reduce the appearance of problem areas and restore women’s self-confidence.The Anti-Cellulite mode will prevent the development of cellulite by toning and tightening the muscles and also improve the blood circulation in order to remove fat nodules in the problem areas.

<p><strong>WELCOME</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the campaign and thank you for taking the time to review the offering. </p>
<p>The aim of this campaign is to produce best practice Yoga Cards as a new way to learn, teach and practice yoga. The cards will be available in digital and printed card format at a price point affordable to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Hola, my name is Fernando Díaz. </strong></p>
<p>I am a certified Physical Therapist, Osteopath and a Yoga Instructor, with many years of practice in Europe, India and Asia. </p>
<p>I have used my knowledge of science and yoga to successfully treat thousands of people with many different musculoskeletal conditions.  I have been delighted to share my knowledge of anatomy and bio mechanics with many yoga teachers through certified yoga teacher training courses.</p>
<p>I am passionate about teaching and practising yoga correctly and safely to prevent unnecessary injuries. This passion and my medical background has led me to develop a best practice guide for yoga postures (asanas) in the form of yoga cards. </p>
<p>The yoga cards provide an easy way to learn, teach and practice yoga correctly and safely. The cards introduce a comfortable starting point to learn the best practice foundation of yoga and a development path to more progressive sequences.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign you are investing in your own yoga knowledge, good health and personal development, ensuring that you gain all the physical and mental benefits that a regular yoga practice can provide.</p>
<p><strong>Your Investment &amp; Your Reward</strong></p>
<p>The goal is €5500. </p>
<p>This will facilitate a higher print volume which will lower the cost of each card.  If this goal is not reached a smaller print production will run from the amount raised, therefore even the smallest investment will make a big impact. </p>
<p>There are four options to invest and participate in this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>€5 - Foundation Yoga Card Set</strong> </p>
<p>A digital yoga card Sun Salutation sequence will be sent to thank you for your support. This is ideal for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>€15 - Digital Yoga Card Set</strong> </p>
<p>A sequence with a Sun Salutation (Surya Namaskar), a Hatha Yoga sequence, Mantra and Sutras Cards. </p>
<p><strong>€28 - Yoga Card Flex Box Set</strong> </p>
<p>A box set with 54 cards - 50 Asanas and 4 philosophy. This is ideal for anyone who is developing their yoga practice and for yoga teachers.</p>
<p><strong>€55 - Professional Premium Yoga Card Box Set</strong></p>
<p>A premium box set of 88 Yoga Cards. 80 Asanas and 8 philosophy cards. This is ideal for anyone who is developing their yoga practice and for yoga teachers.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>As science and research continues to demonstrate the benefits of a regular yoga practice for health and well being, yoga is increasing in popularity amongst all age groups around the world.  According to the Yoga Federation around 300 million people practice yoga worldwide. In the US 56% of yogis are beginners and according to the Yoga Alliance 14 million people practising yoga are over the age of 50 and men practising yoga has increased by 150% in the last 4 years. In this environment Yoga Cards provide best practice help, support and guidance for both students and teachers.</p>
<p>After many years of practice as a Physical Therapist, Osteopath and a Yoga Instructor I recognised a gap in the anatomical and bio mechanical aspect of Yoga education. The Yoga Cards seek to bridge that gap.</p>
<p>A pilot study for the Yoga Cards was successfully completed in 2019. The study included a small group of yoga students, yoga teachers and a sports science department at a University. The feedback received enabled the Yoga Cards to evolve and develop.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The Yoga Card project is now at an advanced stage. The aim is to produce digital and hard copy best practice Yoga Cards which are available at an affordable price point for everyone.  The cost to market will vary depending on volume of print run, volume of purchase and route to market.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to be involved and are not able to contribute financially you can still participate in the following ways:</p>
<p>Please get the word out and make some noise about the campaign. I am sure you know somebody who likes to  practice, study or teach Yoga. The Yoga Cards are for everyone. </p>

</div></div>","Let's face it.. Cardio is boring - and we believe that movement should be exciting. That's why we've pushed the line between gaming and real-life sports by transforming play into a social, fun and active competition that combines physical activity and gaming.Strike, jab, and dodge. JABII gets your pulse up while you're having fun. Playfights between friends of all ages have never been more exciting and safe. JABII gives you all the adrenaline and none of the bruises.JABII is played by two people who face off in a real-life match that combines the techniques of fencing and boxing, without the pain. It is possible through the innovative mechanics in the extendable boxing-device that is the JABII. Using your smartphone, you can track every single punch and even record your glorious battles. It only takes a couple of minutes to start up your match with JABII and get your pulse racing! No need for the change of clothes or the long, tiresome commute to the gym.JABII is fun first, activity second - and our user tests show that people don’t realise that they’ve been physically active and gotten their pulse up until AFTER the match is over.The JABII has been playtested for safe strikes on all ages groups and has been proved to be 100% safe. The rubber front of the JABII works like a reverse airbag that lets out air as it hits your opponent.The 60 specially-made springs pull out the power of every punch, leaving a soft touch on impact. In other words, you can strike your opponents with fury without worrying.The front of the JABII is equipped with a durable rubber pillow. It acts like a reverse airbag and results in punches that you can feel, but which does not hurt.  
 

In your home or outdoors, you decide where you play. All you need is a minimum of 33 square feet (3 m2) of space and you are good to go.
 


Did you know that only two minutes of HIIT training gives the same effort in increased metabolism as 30 minutes of running? The activity of a JABII match is comparable to HIIT training and gives you a fun and quick way to get active.

Studies show that a lot of gym-goers don’t get their pulse up to a high enough level when training alone. With JABII, the adrenaline of the battle is sure to get your whole body moving and heart beating. 

Getting your heart beating faster than its resting rate each day trains your body to move oxygen and blood to your muscles more efficiently - but getting there through traditional training methods can take a lot of time.


 





Many interactive games focus primarily on your upper body parts. JABII matches activate your whole body even in short matches! JABII will make sure your arms, shoulders, core and legs will be activated to the fullest.
The built-in referee controls the match and rules, much the ones you know from Tekken or Street Fighter. The app also keeps track of your every move and saves your personal stats on your player profile.

REAL-LIFE VIDEO GAMINGHit record before the battle and share a video of your victory after the match.

JABII is more than a game. It is an experience that allows you to step into the world of gaming and giving you the chance to become the hero. Experience the adrenaline-pumped feeling of fighting sports, developed by a team including former professional fighters.​


The JABII device is hard to compare to any other game or gadget on the market. Figuring out the design wasn't easy. And once the mechanical construction and idea was finalised, we had to figure out the right materials to create a product that can take a beating.

96 high-quality components - from micro CPUs to light sensors and bluetooth 5.0 - have been expertly added onto the PCB that carries the electronics and brain of the JABII.



There's a ton of features (visible and hidden) in the JABII, we've selected some of those that we are extra proud to have included:




You may have been on a camping trip, business trip, or holiday and thought to yourself ""I wish I brought my dumbbells."" - but did you ever? Probably not - it's too much of a hassle.

Safely chilled milk 20+ hours

Effortless to clean—Use the dishwasher!

Caregivers can feed the baby on the go—Use the lid!
Breeze through security with confidence

Easily connects to every major pump and your hands-free bra—Medela native or use a standard adapter for all other major pumps (choose the Adapter as one of your Perks, includes 2)

 
 

* Lid (3 oz) and inner Milk Chamber (12 oz) easily connect to your hands-free bra. Ounce marks are laser-etched on both to track milk.  
 

 

 
 
 
Choose your color and enjoy!
Our top-quality matte powder-coat finishes launch in three colors to match your style. Each Chiller is available in Plum, Ocean or Sage. Choose your favorite color at Checkout when you purchase your Chiller.  

 
Ceres Chill is...

And it's more affordable! Ceres Chill is more affordable than the current alternatives, especially considering the expense of coolers, ice packs, storage systems, and added plastic bags. 
Did my husband just steal my Ceres Chill for his tailgate?!  Ceres Chill offers moms a beautiful alternative to coolers that they can proudly use for the rest of their lives. But that doesn't mean only moms will love it. With a 36 oz double-walled, stainless steel capacity or a 12 oz inner Milk Chamber for infusing water or chilling favorite beverages without dilution, you'll want to use this Chiller for sports drinks, coffee, tea, fruit-infused water, wine or beer for long after your breastfeeding days are behind you.
And it converts to a baby bottle!Ceres Chill is the best option for caregivers running out with the baby and bringing breastmilk along. Not only can you easily toss it in the diaper bag, you also have a bottle built right into the lid. Watch how...



 


Moms can't wait!

 
 


I've lived through the challenges of breastfeeding and spoken to hundreds of moms. The world needed an alternative to big ol' coolers and loads of plastic.
I know firsthand that it is practically impossible to exclusively nurse a baby for a year: There's just no way to have your baby with you every moment, on every plane, in every boardroom,  or at your side on each battlefield (literally for our soldier moms and figuratively for the rest of us). 
To breastfeed up to this point, we've had no choice but to deal with what was available, no matter how clunky and difficult to use. 
Now we have a choice. We choose our babies, ourselves, and the environment.

</div><div> </div><p> </p></div>","Have you wondered why you feel exhausted even after a long night of rest? Sleep quality matters.  With Respio Sleep Monitor, you can finally UNLOCK the mystery of sleep quality with accurate sleep tracking. Follow its Insights & tips to improve your sleep immediately.Sleep affects every part of life—your health, your mood and more. It can help you perform at your best, stay productive, and fight weight gain and depression. So if you’re ready to make the most of your day, start by improving your night. That's why we developed RESPIO, the smart sleep coach that works as an accurate non-invasive bio-metric tracker that will effortlessly monitor everything about your sleep, allowing you to effectively improve the quality of your sleep.   The Respio Sleep Monitor uses tracked data and analytics to measure, manage, and improve your sleep, right from your phone. Leveraging an extremely thin sensor strip that you’ll never even notice, wake up, open your iPhone or Android app, and learn everything you need to know about your sleep habits.Enjoy automatic tracking that provides you with information related to sleeping times, breathing, snoring, bedroom temperature, and humidity. Plus, with personalized sleep coaches, find a new motivation in your life to improve your sleep quality. A better life starts with more restful sleep. Who doesn't want to sleep better? The best part is that Respio works almost as if it was not there. This is a 1mm thin highly accurate sensor strip that picks up your sleeping patterns as you rest and sleep on it (literally). It works with any mattress, you can perfectly put your bedsheets on top of it and forget about it. Unlike other devices on the market, Respio is not a wearable, so you won’t need to do anything other than sleeping on it!      Respio App analyzes your sleep and life patterns to find the most likely cause with machine learning techniques. Respio App collects the physical information and the daily activities of the user when measuring sleep. By analyzing sleep and activities for more than two weeks, we find the factors that have the greatest effect on sleep. Users will be able to manage the factors that have the greatest effect on sleep and gradually reduce symptoms. Respio accurately analyzes your personal sleep data and calculate your sleep debt. Check your sleep debt just like checking the balance on your bank account. Sleep debt is a fancy term, but it perfectly describes the problem. Every time you do not sleep well, your body and mind accumulate a sleep deficit that keeps on mounting and making you feel exhausted and unproductive, no matter how many cups of coffee you take. If you consecutively abuse your sleep cycle, sleeping for only a few hours each night without any REM sleep or a sleeping environment that is right for you, the abuse is going to add up.For sleep debt analysis, Respio collects the following physical information, gender, age, BMI. Daily activity factors include; alcohol, caffeine, smoking, fever, workout, medicine, stuffy nose, shower, sunlight exposure, stress, change of sleep environment and so on.Respio would never force you to enter your personal information and daily activities to analyze sleep apnea if you are concerned about your privacy. Repsio App optimizes your bedtime and wake time to reduce the sleep debt in the most natural way possible. Besides, it will monitor the sleep environment-humidity, brightness, and temperature and provides suggestions to improve your overall sleep quality.Our goals are simple: we want to accurately detect your sleeping patterns and habits to reduce your sleep debt accumulation. Along the way, we want to make falling sleeping easier for everyone, with an affordable and accessible sleep coach that was made just for you. Repio's Breathing Exercise Program is an incremental upgrade of which A**** inc. offers on there A**** WatchA*****'s breath app just notifies you and shows and guides the same breathing pattern over and over again.

(2) Don’t worry about the effect of electromagnetic radiation,
We have already tested RESPIO in an anechoic chamber with EMI Tester.  Electromagnetic waves are released at a safe level from 9 dBuV/m to 18 dBuV/m.

</div></div>","My dream is to satisfy Israel's craving for our national fast-food favorite with a vibrantly healthy, scrumptiously energizing re-invention of the falafel.
I hope you will join me in fulfilling my two-part mission:
1) To produce great-tasting kosher sprouted pitas and breads for sale to the public--for the first time in Israel!  In America, sprouted bread is in every major supermarket, and easily accessible.  In Israel, we have nothing like this, not even in the health food stores.  There is a huge unmet demand for delicious, high-quality sprouted bread here in Israel.  2) To open Israel's 1st healthy falafel stand, to be located in the Central Jerusalem Market, knows as the 'Shuk'.  It is the center of food culture and the hippest spot to enjoy culinary experiences.   Although the health food stores in the shuk are always packed, currently there are no healthy options for prepared food. 





The concept of falafel is genius: it's simple to make, tastes great, vegan friendly and made with local ingredients.  And while falafel is so awesome, imagine how much better it would be if it weren't made with white pita and falafel deep fried in rancid oil.
Introducing the
   1st Organic, Sprouted Falafel 
     in Jerusalem and Israel



This 'new and improved' falafel will be made using my very own  100% sprouted organic pitas filled with live pesto, fresh hot sauce, homemade pickles and salads. I sprout the chickpeas before cooking them for hummus and the techina is made from soaked and sprouted sesame seeds.   And of course, the sprouted, baked falafel.  (No deep-frying!) 
I only use cold-pressed olive oil, real sea salt, fresh lemon, garlic and herbs, making my unique falafel truly delicious, nutritious and medicinal!
'Let your food be your medicine,' said Hippocrates, father of modern medicine.
'Let your medicine taste amazing,' says Samantha Siegel, founder of Rustic Regal Sprouted Bread Bakery.
Grains, legumes and seeds will be soaked, sprouted and baked to create a fusion of raw, vegan and Middle Eastern cuisine.  And together we will see Jerusalem -- the holiest city in the Holy Land -- serve residents and tourists the world’s healthiest street food.                                                                           


Selling my sprouted falafel at a local fair. People loved it! They couldn't believe how good healthy food can taste. We sold everything.
Who I Am and What I Do


Hi, I'm Samantha Siegel, mother, artist, dancer, baker and founder of Rustic Regal Sprouted Bread Bakery in Jerusalem.  Originally from Chicago, I moved to Israel 12 years ago to learn from Shoshana Harrari, Israel's renown health guru, who has helped thousands of people heal from every ailment under the sun. She taught me the basics of raw, living foods and how to make sprouted bread.

For the past 3 years, I have been supplying the country’s only 100% organic sprouted breads with absolutely no flour, yeast or additives. It contains just the sprouts and sea salt!
(One other bakery in Jerusalem sells a sprouted bread, but it contains flour, oil and sugar.)
Bread for Gluten Intolerance

I have sold thousands of packages of sprouted bread to people throughout the country.  For many of my gluten-intolerant clients, my bread is the only bread they can eat!  

An article in Breaking Israel News that just came out:

 What is Sprouted Bread?

Instead of grinding dormant wheat berries into a lifeless flour, I germinate them into living sprouts.




Sprouts are wonderful for the flavor of the bread and what your body truly needs and desires.  It's the best of both worlds.  
Benefits of Sprouting your Grains

- Sprouting multiplies vitamin and mineral levels up to 600%
- Sprouting decreases 'phytic acid' (an anti-nutrient that blocks mineral absorption), so you can absorb the nutrients from the rest of the meal
- Sprouted grains are tolerated by many people with gluten sensitivities
- Sprouted grains are easily digested and absorbed
- Higher in protein and lower in carbs
- Richer, sweeter and more satisfying than flour 
-Higher in B vitamins and the best option for vegetarians and vegans
- Lower glycemic level, a better option for those with diabetes








Phase 1:  Producing Sprouted Pitas 
I need to set up and outfit my own factory.  This will require rent, infrastructure improvements, purchasing equipment and raw materials, hiring workers, and obtaining approval from the Health Ministry as well as certification for kashrut.  

Health-food stores, organic-food delivery companies, and specialty-catering and organic restaurants are already lined up to purchase our sprouted pitas. 

Phase 2: Our Own Storefront / Sprouted Falafel Stand



There is no better place to open Rustic Regal's Sprouted Falafel than right in the center of it all: the famous Shuk, Jerusalem's outdoor market. The Shuk is the #1 destination for food shopping of all kinds, and is the new trendy hotspot for restaurants and bars.  
My falafel stand will be an eco-friendly, health and fast-food oasis.  It will be quaint, woodsy, and homey, with murals, biblical references and quotes on the walls, a place for physical and spiritual rejuvenation in the middle of the city.

</div></div>","With your help, we're developing a range of revolutionary, discreet, medically-approved inhaled nicotine products that will help smokers across the world quit safely







We're aiming for medical approval from the UK regulatory authority and the FDA in the US so we can help smokers give up effectively and safely
There is growing concern amongst smokers trying to quit that electronic cigarettes and vaping products, while now commonplace, are entirely unregulated and are made in factories where there are no controls on the quality of the parts, materials or chemicals placed inside and heated. These can include substances such as unregulated nicotine concentrate. Aside from news stories about the burns caused by exploding batteries, there is currently no conclusive clinical research evidence on the side effects of e-cigarette chemical vapour on health.



Help us develop a safe medically-licensed alternative for smokers by donating as little as £5 (that's less than $8) TODAY.






Check out our website to find out more about us, our story and how you can be part of a Tobacco Free World at www.tobaccofreeworld.co.uk

When you donate you will:
Help the continuing development of a revolutionary medically-licensed product that will help smokers in Europe and the US quit safely
We need £2.5 million to complete the first phase of this game-changing project. The reason we need so much is that developing a product to the highest safety standards and doing all the work required to obtain a licence from the FDA or MHRA is expensive.  For some current manufacturers of unregulated e-cigarettes, the cost is simply too much. Not only that but developing a licensed, safe product requires the right expertise. We have that expertise, most existing manufacturers do not.We're very clear on what the product needs to do and how to obtain a licence. We've got a detailed business plan for the next two years and we've started on the road to developing our prototype - the first working example of our product. You can read more on our website at www.tobaccofreeworld.co.uk
 By contributing as little as just £5 or $5 you can
help us finish our design and so that we can get our truly innovative product to market. 
How we'll use your money Your money will fund the next phase of our work which will take 9-12 months. Once that's done, we can obtain a licence and make our product available to as many smokers and vapers as possible so they can quit with the reassurance that the product they are using is safe and manufactured to the highest standards.

MIT has selected 50 people from around the globe to go to Boston (USA) this summer to jumpstart their projects at the highly-selective Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp program. Help Miguel Pardo, biologist and entrepreneur, to take 'oncometrik' to the most prestigious technological university in the world to make it real.
How Oncology works today. Treatments in Oncology are still mainly based on trial-and-error:




   How ONCOmetrik will improve treatments design. However, in the last years, we have started to design treatments based on the tumor profile of the patient. We call this ""Precision medicine"".







oncometrik is a tool that will allow physicians to make timely
and informed decisions on a patient’s treatment, based on the DNA profile of the
tumor. 






   
Miguel Pardo, ideator & project leader.
Hi all,




My name is Miguel, ideator and project leader of ONCOmetrik. I am a biologist and entrepreneur with experience in Oncology, working with patients, families, doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and labs. I know the struggles.


I have been selected by MIT to attend the Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp, where the challenge is to take your idea and create a successful startup in 1-week.
I need $10,000 to cover the costs of the program in Boston and jump-start the development of the tool.


SOME ADDITIONAL CV INFO:

Degree in Biology, specializing in Biotechnology (Complutense University, Madrid). I did two fellowships in research in molecular biology on glioblastoma multiforme, a violent type of cancer, and hypertension in adults. Right after my degree, at 22, I co-founded my first company together with a doctor and a lawyer: ONCOHOPE.org, a platform to facilitate cancer patients and their families a better access to state-of-the-art cancer treatments in Spain.
In January 2015, I presented my project Oncometrik (the reason for this campaign) to Singularity University's Call to Innovation 2015, being shortlisted in the Top 50 of more than 15,000 projects.
In June 2015, I was granted an scholarship to participate in a program at Harvard Innovation Lab.


We can make it at MIT. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is reknown for being the home of many technological innovations. We hope to leverage its potential to power the project and attract data scientists, programmers, genetists and medical advisors.  $10,000 is all. How the money will be spent. If we reach our funding goal, the money will be spent in this way:


  $6,000 to cover tuition costs at MIT $1,000 to book a round-trip ticket Madrid (ES) - Boston (USA)
$1,000 to cover accommodation for the week
$2,000 to cover startup creation costs

 With your help and MIT's tutoring, we truly believe this could be the next big leap in cancer care worlwide.

</p>
<p>Dear Friends, Fans of the show and
new Fans</p>
<p>My name is Nicole Monique, the Host
and Producer of That’s What SHE Said Sports. I started That’s What SHE Said
Sports (Sports Talk HER Way) in 2012 after being disillusioned with Shawshank
aka corporate America.<span>  I wanted to go
back to my first love – broadcasting. 
But this time I wanted to combine that love with my passion – sports.
Ever since I was a little girl I wanted to do radio, TV, be an actress or win
the Heisman Trophy.  My parents always
said to dream BIG. </span></p>
<p>I’m incredibly proud of what I’ve
accomplished ‘so far’ but there is still so much work to do.<span>  I originally started doing shows at local
sports bars  and from there created my podcast with my good friend and co-dude Bee
Gee.  As the audience started growing we
decided to move our show to 920 the Answer a radio station located in the heart
of Buckhead in Atlanta. We are on Saturday’s from 4-6pm. This is where we need
YOU. We are definitely onto something
but need your help in keeping it going.  </span></p>
<p>Air is not cheap and we have created
this campaign to 'stay' on the air.<span>  Your
contributions keep us on 920 the Answer, it keeps our name out there and allows
us to grow the show even more.  Every
penny gives us the opportunity to do what we do best on the air – talk,
entertain and have fun. </span></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Our goal is $55,000 – this allows us
to pay the radio station for our air time and keep us going every Saturday
afternoon.<span>  We pay per hour and we get
billed monthly and with football season right around the corner – we need to be
on the air! Football season is our favorite time of the year and the let’s call
them “discussions” are beyond entertaining. </span></p>
<p>We’ve put together some really good
perks – everything from a shout out on the air, a gift certificate towards a
cruise and giving you the opportunity to co-host live on the air with me and
Bee Gee. </p>
<p>Now if we don’t reach our goal (but
I feel that we will) whatever we get will go to the station.<span>  Some time on the air is better than nothing. </span></p>

Bee Gee and I can’t do it alone. We
appreciate all those who follow us on social media and those who faithfully call

our fans “we want more.”  That’s our goal
with this campaign – to give more.  We pride
ourselves in the work we do in the community – volunteering with local food
banks, working with the special Olympics and providing a platform to all those
who normally wouldn’t get a shot to tell their story.  </span></p>
<p>We have built relationships with

our audience we will be able to get the sponsors needed after this year. So
this campaign is important to get us headed in the right direction.  Without it we can’t do the show – plain and

What is Dentem?
Dentem is a platform which allows dental clinics to better manage their business by utilizing electronic tools. Simple implementation of ERP - CRM (Enterprise Resource Planning - Client Relationship Management) for dental clinics allows users to store patients files, manage agendas and monitor financials among other things. 
Patients also benefit from Dentem as they can access their doctors agenda, book an appointment online, search for new clinics, rate and comment on clinics. 
The platform stretches beyond basics. We will introduce a crowdfunding platform for all dental needs that are going to be integrated into the platform. Our team is working on a Visual API to allow researchers to analyze massive data, slice and dice report information as needed. Sparing them all the time they would need to run all those surveys. The platform is web based and the apps are available on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

</h3> <p></p>
<p>Founded in 2012 in Bethesda, MD, <a href=""lollyslocks.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lolly’s Locks</a> is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to providing high-quality wigs to cancer patients suffering hair loss as a side-effect of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Lolly’s Locks works with wig-providers across the country to serve a diverse population of women because we know cancer has no boundaries. In just over two years, we have provided wigs to over 365 cancer patients in 44 states.</p>
<p>Hair loss is one of the most psychologically detrimental side-effects of cancer. When women lose their hair, they lose a part of their identity. High-quality wigs can cost thousands of dollars, and are typically not covered by insurance. In collaboration with our wig-providers, we seek to ensure that our recipients receive a wig that is stylized and personalized to them to make them maintain dignity, normalcy, and privacy in their lives despite the traumatic effects of cancer.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>As we have grown, we have been fortunate to receive both
national and local press. The press was targeted primarily at one of our
audience- potential recipients- but not to the donors that make our mission
possible. Thus, applications poured in, but donations did not keep up.  This led to our having to make the extremely hard decision to close our application process until we brought in more money.</p>
<p>In the last month we have made enormous strides to allow us
to be able to reopen as soon as possible. We have scoured the internet applying
for every grant possible, we have reached out to new donor populations, we have
spread the word about Lolly's Locks as far and as wide as our hearts can reach.
We have signed up for farmers markets, worked with fundraisers, reached out to
retail stores, sought out new partners. We have spent hours upon hours trying to
figure out how to sustain our mission financially when each wig costs our
organization right around $1,000. I often wake up in the middle of the night
thinking about ways to bring in more donations. I have been keeping a notepad
next to my bed for this reason. I will wake up with text scattered across a
sticky note reminding me to email a donor or to reach out to a new company. I
check my email constantly hoping that a new donation has reached my inbox. We bicker over who gets to open the mail, just to see if a new check
has come in. We find ourselves on the phone, early in the
morning, weekends, late at night, discussing possible fundraising options.</p>
<p>The decision to close applications was bittersweet. Naturally,
we are so disappointed that we are unable to sustain with current demand. We
have consistently stated that our goal is to never turn away a worthy recipient
and by closing applications, we are leaving many women desiring our services in
the lurch. We get calls every day from women asking when we will be able to
open our doors again. These are women that want to feel comfortable in their
own skin, that want to feel like themselves. It breaks my heart to turn them
away. Coming in to work and not calling recipient after recipient is so hard.
It makes me cringe to think that there are women that visit our website and are
greeted with the message that our application is closed when they are in dire
need of the normalcy that a quality wig would provide.</p>
<p>We
are slowly getting closer to our goal to be able to reopen applications but we
still have a ways to go. We are now turning to you to help us fund wigs for TEN
cancer patients in need. This will cost us approximately $10,000, and we are
asking for your help and compassion to help us do it. <br/></p>
<p>We have some great swag that will look great on you AND help to spread the word about Lolly's Locks to your nearest and dearest! If you donate the amounts specified below, we will happily send you the corresponding item while supplies last!</p>

This well kept secret is now available to you through this campaign - so check out the perks to the right to purchase our select finest quality matcha - NEOMATCHA and start everyday the ZEN way!

WHY NEOMATCHA?
Rooted in Japanese tradition, the Japanese tea ceremony, established by Zen-master Sen-no-Rikyu, is about more than just drinking tea; it is a spiritual journey that embodies harmony and tranquility. 
A high quality Green Tea - Matcha is traditionally prepared by adding hot water to the matcha powder and whisking to a froth, allowing the drinker to enjoy the benefits of the entire green tea leaf.


Inspired by the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, NEOMATCHA a daily cup of Zen  


To produce the freshest finest quality matcha - NEOMATCHA has chosen to partner with tea farmers who combine traditional methods with modern technology to produce a high quality product with huge health benefits.

THE PROCESS



Prior to the Spring harvest, green tea fields are gradually covered over in order to reduce the amount of sunlight exposed to the leaves. 


Shading is only implemented for high-grade teas that are used to produce some of the best matcha in the world. 

By reducing natural photosynthesis in the leaves, the plants increase chlorophyll production, which gives our matcha its vibrant green color.








Our matcha is cultivated in Nishio, which is located in the heart of the Aichi Prefecture. 


Nishio’s ideal misty climate and rolling hills makes it the perfect region to produce a very high grade Japanese green tea. 


The tea produced in Nishio has a much deeper taste and aroma as well as a more vibrant green color. 

While green tea is harvested in many countries such as China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, only Japan produces the highest-quality matcha. 


THE BENEFITS OF MATCHA



MATCHA - THE UNSUNG SUPERFOOD
Matcha is a finely stone ground,
green tea powder that contains a wealth of antioxidants, amino acids,
chlorophyll, and many vitamins and nutrients.

antioxidants, which provides protection from:


Ageing 


Tissue damage

value of wild blueberries.

Sugar-Free




FACT: Matcha is surgar-free and low calorie (less than 3 calories per serving)!




Provides Sustained Energy

jittering and crashing normally associated with coffee and other sources of caffeine. 



Natural Detox




Matcha contains a wealth of chlorophyll, which is natural detoxifier. eliminating harmful chemicals and heavy
metals from the body as well as regenerating the body on a cellular level. 
Matcha
also contains dietary fiber, a detoxifying agent that can curb appetite and

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Barry Davidson and I
am the founder or Caddo Mountain Spring Water. And I'm passionate about clean,
pure water and here is the reason why!</p>
<p><b>The</b> <b><i>Technology</i></b> <b>does not exist
(it is scientifically impossible) to filter out all of the contaminates that
can be found in a lot of U.S. municipal sourced water (tap water) - the base
ingredient for most bottled “purified” water.</b> Particularly harmful contaminates
in water that cannot be filtered out are Nano-particles of heavy metals such as
Aluminum and Pharma Drugs. “Purified” water versus spring water is like
comparing a poor grade of cheese spread or worse to real cheese! The reason
most of the major U.S. water bottlers are bottling and selling “purified” water
(Pure Life/Nestle’, Aquafina/PepsiCo, Dasani/Coca-Cola) is the difficulty in
finding, accessing and availability (if not sustainability) of good all natural
spring water and, of course, the cost.</p>
<p><b>We found our world class all
natural spring water in a sparsely populated mountain area surrounded by
National Forest Lands.</b></p>
<p>The availability of good drinking
water is going to become a much larger problem in the future. Improper Chemical
Manufacturing, Mining, Oil &amp; Gas Exploration and Waste Water Treatment
practices, as well as runoff from farm and ranch operations has been hugely <b><i>disruptive</i></b>
to US Fresh Water sources. These improper practices are contaminating and displacing
clean water that could have been used for drinking water. <b>The largest U.S. water
bottler had contaminates found in fracking fluids in two of its branded water
products according to their own water analysis reports!</b></p>
<p><b>We’re here to change that with
the cleanest, purest, healthiest, mountain spring sourced water in the world. </b>We
are an “American Owned” company and we need your help. Your contributions will
help us to build a facility to bring our spring water to bottling plants for
distribution around the country so “You Can Drink Healthy Again.”</p>
<p><b>Good drinking water is a serious
and growing health issue that needs your help. Watch our video and Take Back Your
Rights to clean, pure water. It’s a matter of health for you and your family.</b></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<b>We need approximately $1 million in equity funding today to allow us to build our own complete source water bottling facility. However, our Crowdfunding Campaign goal today is only $300,000 which will allow us to complete and operate a bulk water loading facility at our source water location.</b> With a bulk water loading operation we can move our water to other peoples' bottling plants to bottle our water. If we don't reach our Campaign goal we will utilize whatever monies we do raise to set about putting our bulk water loading facility in place one piece of equipment at a time.</div>
<div>
<b>We have some outstanding perks for you to say ""Thank You"" for supporting our project.</b> We were fortunate enough to be personally introduced early on to a great group of creative people from Phoenix, AZ at Production Services Arizona who produced our Campaign Video and helped us come up with some one of kind ""premiums"". A lot of thought and effort went into our perk offerings. We truly tried to tie together our supporter rewards to give everyone the best sense of a community project possible. We believe we have a premium for everyone. In fact, if you don't agree and have a perk idea for us that you think would be a great addition to our offerings please let us know and we will give your idea serious consideration. <b>Please view our Crowdfunding Campaign Video as we worked very hard to make it both informative and entertaining. It is narrated by MythBusters' Robert Lee from Down Under. Robert with his distinctive accent, helped us to challenge a water myth!</b>
</div>
<div>All of our utility premiums come with a definite tie to our Company and/or project. <b>A number of our rewards entail name recogition and naming rights of the supporter tied to our source water property which will create a lasting association between us! Our Vision is to Preserve and Enhance our water's naturally pristine, aesthetic and historic-storied location.</b> We have a house, artesian well and barns that date back to the 1800s. One of our barns (""Over Yonder"") has a great story and is about to be featured in a Public TV documentary titled ""Barns of Arkansas"". The beautiful Caddo River-truly one of the most gorgeous rivers in America, runs thru the center of our 100+ acre property. We have a recent vintage mountain side cabin which overlooks the Caddo River Valley in need of some TLC so people can enjoy it. And of course, we have numerous attractive Springs! </div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<b>With the support of the Crowdfunding Community we can make available the finest all natural spring water obtainable during a time when good clean water is in dwindling supply.</b> <b>Our world class spring water along with our Advocacy for Clean Water, Sustainability and Care for the Environment and our American stewardship of its best spring water can make a difference in enhancing the health and lives of millions of people.</b> <i>The number one goal of the Company is to exceed the expectations of its product consuming public.</i>
</div>
<div>I have Founded or Co-founded successful start-up entities in the past. I believe creating jobs and making the payroll of an organization you founded or helped to found is a true test of your leadership and management ability.<br/>
</div>
<div>I have a long history as a Registered Investment Advisor with an unblemished record of handling peoples' money. The entities and monies under my direction have enjoyed only unqualified audits and audit reports. Mike Boswell our Co-founder was part of a large investment organization for some 16 years and its President for five years. We each enjoy an outstanding reputation which is the most important thing to us.</div>
<div>You can hear me discuss water with Jeff ""Erskine"" Payton the Host of the syndicated radio program ""<b>Erskine Overnight</b>"" in an hour long segment airing Ocober 10, 2015 and arkived thereafter on his website for later listening. It was a privilege for me to be on Erskine's program. He is very knowledgeable about water and water issues today. He won a award in 2014 for ""Excellence in Health Journalism"".</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>
<b>Our biggest challenge at this time is equity funding for the Company.</b> The vast majority of wealth gatekeepers today don't want to invest in start-up entities. They got burned with their start-up investments during the great ""recession"" of 2008-2009 and don't want to risk repeating that experience.</div>
<div>We believe Crowdfunding is a natural fit for us to raise equity for our new Company. We trust that our project and its attributes will resonate with millions of people. We have sourced the best all natural spring water obtainable. People everywhere need good clean water to sustain their life and flourish. Our source water property is pristine, protected and sustainable-renewable and has a great legacy. We are an American owned Company whose interests are aligned with the American people particularly with regard to clean water, sustainability and care for the environment. We can have a large positive social impact enhancing the health and lives of millions of people with our water, our Advocacy for Clean Water, Sustainability and Care for the Environment. Finally, Mike and I have the Leadership Ability, Experience and Integrity to help assure our project's success! </div>
<div>
<b>We like and share the same sense of Community that Crowdfunding entails.</b> We are happy and thrilled to formally intoduce our Caddo Mountain Spring Water product for the first time on the Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign platform. We are passionate about our spring water, the Company's potential future success and the positive social impact that will come from our project. Hopefully, we will be welcomed into the Crowdfunding Community and can be the next ""Poster Child"" for a successful Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Contributing as well as Other Ways You Can Help!</h3>

I need your help to bring the Cane Angel to all those folks who can benefit from this invention such as the elderly, handicapped, veterans and others who use a cane or crutches.</p>
<p>The idea for the Cane Angel came to me while watching my 88 year old mother &amp; 90 year old step dad, who are cane users, try and negotiate simple everyday tasks. For example at a restaurant they would have to prop their canes against a wall, out of reach, under the table or against the chair where they are in the way or fall. When they go to the bank or any counter and they need to use both hands, many times they set their canes against a wall and their cane falls to the floor. This is difficult for them or any elderly or handicapped person to bend to pick up their canes. The Cane Angel solves this problem by enabling the user to attach their cane or crutches to their belt, purse, chair, walker or electric scooter. </p>
<p>I love my family as I am sure you do. Like me, you would do anything to help make their lives easier. And what about other elderly people and especially veterans? They have done so much for all of us. Now is your chance  to help by making the Cane Angel available to all those in need. Don't take my word for it. Look around and take note of the people around you who use a cane or crutches. You'll see for yourself the disadvantages they face daily. </p>
<p>Your contribution, either financially or word of mouth can make a tremendous difference in their lives. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am seeking $5,000.00 toward the manufacturing, website and marketing of the Cane Angel. Initial sales will be through our website, word of mouth on social media, news outlets and direct to Veterans groups and senior publications. Word of mouth by you, our contributors, will play a significant role.</p>
<p>Our website: CANEANGEL.COM will be ready to launch in a few weeks. On the site we will offer the Cane Angel for only $10.00, with the initial offer as a BUY ONE GET ONE FREE. In the offer we encourage buyers to use one and share the extra Cane Angel with a family member, friend or better yet, a veteran or total stranger.</p>
<p>I want you to know how much I appreciate you and thank you that I have plenty of PERKS to help you make the Cane Angel available to all who need one. Please take a look at our PERKS and choose the one that's right for you.</p>
<h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3>
</div><div> <p> Our initial fundraising goal is modest but hope that we reach and even surpass our goal. I believe the cost of doing business will be self funded once the Cane Angel is available for sale online. </p>
<p>The good news is that the Cane Angel is manufactured in the U.S.A.. Quality control can be easily checked during the manufacturing process to ensure top quality. Cane Angel is Patent Pending and Trademark applied for.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I would love to have you as a contributor. We need all the financial help we can get. However, please don't let this stop you from getting the word out about the Cane Angel. Your help with social media is invaluable. Or, if you have a good idea of another way of spreading the word, please contact me. I'd love to hear your ideas. If we can implement them we certainly will.</p>

Your contribution, either financially or word of mouth can make a tremendous difference in their lives.    What We Need & What You Get I am seeking $5,000.00 toward the manufacturing, website and marketing of the Cane Angel. Initial sales will be through our website, word of mouth on social media, news outlets and direct to Veterans groups and senior publications. Word of mouth by you, our contributors, will play a significant role.
Our website: CANEANGEL.COM will be ready to launch in a few weeks. On the site we will offer the Cane Angel for only $10.00, with the initial offer as a BUY ONE GET ONE FREE. In the offer we encourage buyers to use one and share the extra Cane Angel with a family member, friend or better yet, a veteran or total stranger.
I want you to know how much I appreciate you and thank you that I have plenty of PERKS to help you make the Cane Angel available to all who need one. Please take a look at our PERKS and choose the one that's right for you.
Risks & Challenges
  Our initial fundraising goal is modest but hope that we reach and even surpass our goal. I believe the cost of doing business will be self funded once the Cane Angel is available for sale online. 
The good news is that the Cane Angel is manufactured in the U.S.A.. Quality control can be easily checked during the manufacturing process to ensure top quality. Cane Angel is Patent Pending and Trademark applied for.   Other Ways You Can Help I would love to have you as a contributor. We need all the financial help we can get. However, please don't let this stop you from getting the word out about the Cane Angel. Your help with social media is invaluable. Or, if you have a good idea of another way of spreading the word, please contact me. I'd love to hear your ideas. If we can implement them we certainly will.
And don't forget that Indiegogo has share tools to help.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>For the past
year, I have been teaching full yoga classes on the karma SUPtra board to my clients, and as you will read in the Testimonials below, the classes have been an absolute hit!
Propelled by all of this enthusiastic support, I launched karma SUPtra officially, as an Exhibitor, at
the 2015 Yoga Conference in Toronto, with the goal of sharing
this extraordinary practice with the rest of the world! This too was a
resounding success, from both a feedback and exposure standpoint! Boards are now
available on a made-to-order basis, for both Individual Purchase and for Volume Studio Purchase. Ultimately, I would love to see the karma SUPtra, Indoor SUP-Yoga System, rolled out as a part of the karma SUPtra brand…a program introduced to <b>Y<i>oga Studios across North
America</i></b><span><i>, potentially globally, </i>with
karma SUPtra providing a turnkey solution in terms of curriculum and
equipment.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>BIG GOALS I know!!! That's where you come in! If karma SUPtra
excites you, like it does me, I invite you to join me in launching karma SUPtra into the
stratosphere!!!  How? Be the very best
cheerleader you can be…post comments and share this campaign with as many
people as you can, I would be most grateful! 
And if making a financial contribution to the business development of
karma SUPtra, in exchange for some awesome perks, is where your heart and head
lead you, well, that would be just AMAZING too!!! Together, we can take this
powerful, playful practice to the masses and help
make the world a healthier, happier place!!!</p>
<p> Gratitude &amp; Namaste. </p>

<h2>Kind Words About karma SUPtra!</h2>
<p><i style=""font-style: italic; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">With our SUP season being as short
as it is, many people long to keep their season alive. SUP Yoga has become a
very real portion of the SUP market/industry, and the Karma SUPtra Indoor SUP Yoga Board takes it from the water to the studio, almost seamlessly. The boards
width allows you to open your stance, and the three balance cushion system is a
close to the real thing as you can get. The cushions allow the board to roll
gently from side to side, forcing you to concentrate on your balance and your mid-line. The cushions are sized perfectly to the shape of the board and provide the proper amount of resistance that will allow you recover if you do
start to roll. The Karma SUPtra board and Julie’s playful, yet mindful,
practice make this an activity that even the most seasoned Yogi, SUP’er, or
weekend warrior would appreciate! - </i><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Glen Buchanan;

Board dimensions are optimized, </span><b>longer and wider</b><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, to ensure space for proper alignment in yoga poses and it features </span><b>a sticky mat surface</b><span style=""font-style: normal;""> to reduce slippage.

<h2><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Art-Inspired karma SUPtra Boards</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The above covers function, let’s talk flare!  From
the beginning I had a vision of the boards appearing larger than life; the
capacity to facilitate an experience beyond the physical practice! A board,
when not in use, that you could proudly lean or hang on your wall, as part of your home
or office décor…a piece of art that continues to inspire and compel you! One
small problem, yours truly is a terrible artist-ha!ha! However, I live in a
community rich and thriving with artistic talent, therefore it seemed only
right to pay homage and keep it local! This led me to the uber-gifted Krista
and to say the least, a collaboration made in heaven. And for me, she has
totally captured the playful, vibrant spirit of karma SUPtra and the essence of
my most fave activities; Yoga and SUP. Check out our first, Art-Inspired Back Board Graphics…Wake Up &amp; Be Awesome, Namaste and the latest
addition, Fire in the Belly! And, this is just the beginning!!!</span></p>

year, I have been teaching full yoga classes on the karma SUPtra board to my clients, and as you will read in the Testimonials below, the classes have been an absolute hit!
Propelled by all of this enthusiastic support, I launched karma SUPtra officially, as an Exhibitor, at
the 2015 Yoga Conference in Toronto, with the goal of sharing
this extraordinary practice with the rest of the world! This too was a
resounding success, from both a feedback and exposure standpoint! Boards are now
available on a made-to-order basis, for both Individual Purchase and for Volume Studio Purchase. Ultimately, I would love to see the karma SUPtra, Indoor SUP-Yoga System, rolled out as a part of the karma SUPtra brand…a program introduced to Yoga Studios across North
America, potentially globally, with
karma SUPtra providing a turnkey solution in terms of curriculum and
equipment.

BIG GOALS I know!!! That's where you come in! If karma SUPtra
excites you, like it does me, I invite you to join me in launching karma SUPtra into the
stratosphere!!!  How? Be the very best
cheerleader you can be…post comments and share this campaign with as many
people as you can, I would be most grateful! 
And if making a financial contribution to the business development of
karma SUPtra, in exchange for some awesome perks, is where your heart and head
lead you, well, that would be just AMAZING too!!! Together, we can take this
powerful, playful practice to the masses and help
make the world a healthier, happier place!!!
 Gratitude & Namaste.

Kind Words About karma SUPtra!
With our SUP season being as short
as it is, many people long to keep their season alive. SUP Yoga has become a
very real portion of the SUP market/industry, and the Karma SUPtra Indoor SUP Yoga Board takes it from the water to the studio, almost seamlessly. The boards
width allows you to open your stance, and the three balance cushion system is a
close to the real thing as you can get. The cushions allow the board to roll
gently from side to side, forcing you to concentrate on your balance and your mid-line. The cushions are sized perfectly to the shape of the board and provide the proper amount of resistance that will allow you recover if you do
start to roll. The Karma SUPtra board and Julie’s playful, yet mindful,
practice make this an activity that even the most seasoned Yogi, SUP’er, or
weekend warrior would appreciate! - Glen Buchanan;

Manager Rogue Stand-up Paddleboards, WPA SUP Flatwater Instructor

The karma SUPtra System
The Karma SUPtra Indoor Yoga Board has been thoughtfully crafted to emulate the outdoor SUP-Yoga experience on water. The board is supported by a series of inflatable cushions, which serve to increase or decrease the stability of the board. Board dimensions are optimized, longer and wider, to ensure space for proper alignment in yoga poses and it features a sticky mat surface to reduce slippage. The Karma SUPtra Indoor Yoga Board may become your new yoga mat!!!
Specs:
Board: 3/4"" maple ply; 78"" x 23.5"" x 5/8"" (18 pounds)
Cushions: Small, 13.8"" diameter, color: blue; Large, 23.6 diameter, color: blue
*Each board comes with 2 x small cushions and 1 x large cushion.
 



Art-Inspired karma SUPtra Boards
The above covers function, let’s talk flare!  From
the beginning I had a vision of the boards appearing larger than life; the
capacity to facilitate an experience beyond the physical practice! A board,
when not in use, that you could proudly lean or hang on your wall, as part of your home
or office décor…a piece of art that continues to inspire and compel you! One
small problem, yours truly is a terrible artist-ha!ha! However, I live in a
community rich and thriving with artistic talent, therefore it seemed only
right to pay homage and keep it local! This led me to the uber-gifted Krista
and to say the least, a collaboration made in heaven. And for me, she has
totally captured the playful, vibrant spirit of karma SUPtra and the essence of
my most fave activities; Yoga and SUP. Check out our first, Art-Inspired Back Board Graphics…Wake Up & Be Awesome, Namaste and the latest
addition, Fire in the Belly! And, this is just the beginning!!!

You enter your scores into the G4CTour App after each round you play on tour and our application figures your ""net score"" based on the tee blocks you play and the rating of the course you are playing. It does this every time you play. 

We do not use outside organizations handicaps. When you play on the G4CTour you are establishing a handicap with us. This way handicaps are based on rounds you play with us. This keeps people who try to cheat off the site. It also allows us to share only the range of handicap you are in, instead of an exact number. 


This keeps people from trying to shoot certain scores based on an exact handicap number. The beauty of this is that even though it is a complicated subject we make it simple you just do the following 

Golf

Enter your score for that round and we do the rest. 




These rounds must be played with at least one other competitor. This can be someone you know or it can be someone you found on our find a competitor tool. 
We have several tools to aid in the authentication of your scores. A few of these are automatic location verification over the period of the round via satellite imaging 

as well as both competitors must verify the others score correctly for the round to post along with this we limit how many times you can play with the same competitor. 


Each round you play also automatically populates your name into the leaderboard in the state you are registered. But you are free to compete in any state at anytime. 
These rounds are paid out twice a week. 
So Monday to Friday is considered one day and will be paid out within 48 hours of the close of the day Friday. The second day is Saturday to Sunday. During these time periods you are free to play as many rounds as you would like to try and improve your position. 
Each round you play will also earn you points no matter how you finish you earn points. 
These points are accumulated all season and on two occasions the top 288 in each state will play for a running total jackpot that takes a small percentage of every entry and pools it until the time of the event. 
These events are called Majors the are held mid season and at the end of the season and should draw jackpots in excess of $100,000. Each state will have its own season depending on its weather. Some States will have year round seasons with three Majors. 


The beauty of the app is it also allows men and women to compete together as well as amateur players who wish to compete but want to keep their status as an amateur can play and receive gift cards in the amount allowable by the USGA. 
As you can see G4CTOUR is creating a community were you can meet and compete with other golfers no matter what their skill level. 
G4CTOUR uses an odds chart created by Dean Knuth that states the odds for shooting certain scores based on each handicap. We use this chart as well to throw out unrealistic scores those of over 250,000 to 1 odds. 
G4CTOUR also has set up 2 divisions to keep it fair for 20+ handicap and 0 handicap players. Since the odds are greater to shoot lower than your handicap in the higher ranges. We have a 0-15 Division and a 16+ Division

<p>Androgenetic alopeciais a problem which
50% men and 10% women will be faced. Aging process faced by each person could initiate

hair loss problem, and are likely to offer a cure idea for other complicated
diseases. Our products are put on the market as special cosmetics in China
(similar to Quasi-Drug Label in Japan), but special cosmetics cannot be
advertised as a drug for treating hair loss problem, so the product won’t be
known by customers or recognized by doctors even it can solve the problem of
hair loss. That’s the reason <b>we decide to apply to the FDA for investigational
new drug (IND) and new drug applications (NDA).</b></p><p></p><h2><b>Why Do We Want
Crowdfunding?</b></h2>
<p>About
two out of ten Chinese adult males experience hair loss, while about one out of
twenty adult women does. Therefore in China it is estimated that there are 65
million men and 15 million women are suffering hair loss. In the United States
about four out of seven adult males are suffering hair loss.</p>
<p>There
are an estimated 40 million men and 12 million women experiencing some degree
of hair loss in the United States alone. Two-thirds of American men will see
the affects of Androgenetic alopecia by the age of 35.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1370899/files/20150410001234-11.jpg?1428649954"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 620px; height: 1653px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>In order to meet
such a large market demand, we decided to launch this crowdfunding.</b></p>
<p><b>The
crowdfunding will be used for the production, while the rest of the money will
be used for preclinical study, phase I clinical research and application to the
FDA for clinical tests.</b></p>
<p>The cost of FDA application for preclinical trials and phase I
clinical study is estimated as $2 million. We will raise funds by crowdfunding
and fill the gap by other means.</p>
<h2><b>Reasons for Androgenetic
Alopecia</b></h2>
<p>Male hormone
translates into DHT which will block the hair follicle regeneration. DHT can
make obstacles in the process of hair follicle stem cells translating into hair
follicle cells, preventing hair follicle regeneration, thus regenerated hair
follicles keep shrinking until disappear. </p>
<p>The study found
that hair follicle stem cells in hair loss area are normal, so hair follicle
stem cells loss is not the main cause of hair loss (<a href=""http://www.jci.org/articles/view/44478"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://www.jci.org/articles/view/44478"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">learn more about the study</a>).</p>
<p>There are two
possible ways of DHT blocking hair follicle regeneration process: 1. DHT leads
to the hyperplasia and enlargement of sebaceous gland near the top of  head, as with DHT leads to the prostate
enlargement of male, which squeezes the survival space of the hair follicles,
therefore stopping hair follicle regeneration after normal falling off; 2.
After the cycle of hair follicle anagen, catagen and telogen, the body will
give hair follicle stem cells the right stimulation signal, initiating the hair
follicle stem cells regeneration process but DHT accumulation interferes or
disrupts the signal transmission, thus blocking the regeneration process of
hair follicle stem cells differentiating into hair follicle cells.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1370904/files/20150410001443-22.jpg?1428650083"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1378001/files/20150412221019-reason.jpg?1428901819"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Both two ways lead
to the same result: sebaceous gland cells encroach on the space of hair
follicles, thus hair loss area is not only very oily (that’s why every hair
loser has this problem), and making hair follicle regeneration lose physical
space and more difficult.</p><h2><b>Androgenetic Alopecia
Treatment Difficulties</b></h2>
<p>1. <b>How to make physical space for hair follicles.</b> The long process of hair loss with hair follicles falling off,
and sebaceous glands cells gradually occupy the space of the hair follicle. The
simple physical logic tells us that physical space must be made for hair
follicle for its regeneration. If see some effective hair regrowth
technologies, such as hair transplant surgery, you will find the most simple
idea of providing specific space for hair follicle is man-made wound.</p>
<p>The study found that man-made wound healing process will produce
new hair follicle stem cells group and new hair (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7142/abs/nature05766.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7142/abs/nature05766.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">learn more about the study</a>).</p>
<p>From hair transplant surgery we will find that hair follicles in
transplantation area can regenerate after being removed. But in the hair loss
area, making new pores and transplanting new hair follicles which all fall off
after 3 months. The regenerated hair follicles in hair loss area should have
nothing to do with transplanted hair follicles. The man-made bigger wound for
new pore is the key to regenerate hair follicles in hair transplant surgery.</p>
<p>Talents of Chinese people with traditional Chinese medicine
experience and exploration also provide an effective way of hair regrowth. That
is using plum needle to knock on the head. Almost all Chinese medicine hair
regrowth shops, no matter what kind of Chinese traditional medicine they choose
use plum needle head knocking as supplementary means. In fact, knocking on the
head with plum needle is the only solution of hair regrowth that might work. Because
plum needle which knocking on the hair loss area can make a lot of wounds. Even
without stem cells stimulation, it may also be accompanied by new hair follicle
regeneration during the wounds heal.</p>
<p>2. <b>How to initiate hair follicles regeneration by hair follicle stem
cells.</b> Modern medicines generally use cytokines to stimulate stem cell
regeneration process. The special stem cells need special cytokines to
stimulate them. But now there is no broad spectrum stimulating factor being
found.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1378002/files/20150412221054-key.jpg?1428901854"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2><b>How Does
WanBinCell work?</b></h2><p><b>WanBinCell</b>

<h3><b>In Situ Tissue Regeneration Technology</b></h3>
<p>Our
patent provides a method of initiating mammal’s stem cell proliferation,
migration and differentiation. This method can persistently initiate in situ
stem cells proliferation, migration and differentiation with minimal or no side
effects. We have not only developed the theory of “in situ tissue

regeneration of stem cells near damaged tissues, so as to cure the disease or
restore young tissues.

<h3><b>Mechanism</b></h3>
<p>Drugs(<b>stem cell initiators</b>) are used on the
targeted aging or damage tissues. <b>Stem cell initiators</b> will initiate healthy
tissue regeneration of stem cells through three functions: 1. Stem cell
initiators remove damaged or senescent cells, and make specific space for
tissue regeneration; 2. Stem cell initiators as exogenous gas signal molecule activate
stem cell proliferation, migration and differentiation; 3. Stem cell initiators
regulate the immune response, to avoid infection. Under the
induce of specific space, damaged tissues or surrounded normal stem cells
regenerate new functional young tissues through proliferation, migration and
differentiation. Impaired cells are removed as making room for tissue
regeneration. Disease is cured and young tissues are restored by new tissues
replacing impaired ones.</p>

<p><b>Why WanBinCell Works So Quickly?</b></p>
<p>New hair can
regrow in about 5 days in half bald area. This is because WanBinCell contains stem cell initiators<span> factors. They penetrate scalp, reach hair follicle stem
cells, and stimulate the stem cells to grow new hair follicles. Wound will heal
in 5 days, with the factors, new hair follicles could regeneration 5 days. In
half bald area, hair follicles and their living space still exist, therefore
new hair follicles have space to grow quickly.</span></p>
<p><b>Why It has Slower Effect in Bald Area?</b></p>
<p>In
bald area, there are almost no hair follicles; their space has been taken up by
sebaceous gland cells. Even there are stem cell regeneration stimulate factors,
it is impossible to have regenerated hair follicles because of the limited
physical space. So it works slowly in bald area. But by continuously creating man-made
micro wounds, hair follicles will have physical space for survival. Generally
in 1 to 3 months, healthy thick new hair can regrow even in
bald area.</p>
<p><b>Why Have Severe Shedding Period? Can it Be Avoided? </b></p>
<p>Physical
space is still the key point to solve the problem of Androgenetic alopecia. Because
there are limited physical space and old hair follicles have not been cleared,
new hair follicles could not regenerate. Natural regeneration of hair follicles
is a process that new hair follicles replace old hair follicles which are in telogen.
In fact, severe Shedding of hair exists in all effective products, such as
Minoxidil and Finasteride. In the first 3 months after an effective hair
transplant surgery, hairs grow from new transplant hair follicles will fall off
entirely. Now it is inevitable and must be accepted. This period also has
psychological impact. Different from transplant surgery, using WanBinCell does
not need to shave all the old hair. Shedding period especially long hair fall
off give shocks, while new hair grow in the speed of 1mm/3 days.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How Woman Avoid Severe Shedding Period?</b></p>
<p>Due
to woman’s hair loss generally is not as serious as man, we recommend you to
use plum needle and reduce the use time of WanBinCell. For example use WanBinCell
for one week (7 days), select one day from this week to knock head with plum
needle, then stop for a week, and keep doing it. Even men can use this method
to avoid Shedding period. For men who can accept the period, using plum needle once
a week is also helpful.</p>
<p><b>Severe Shedding Periods Due to Hair Being Burned
off?</b></p>
<p>Because
of the need to make tiny wounds, WanBinCell has a little corrosion effect.
Corrosion effect is similar to hydrogen peroxide used in dyeing, but won’t burn
out the hair for the following reasons: 1. If WanBinCell burns off hair, new
hair won’t appear when using it. Even new hairs appear, it will not continue to
grow. If you use it for 20 days, new hair can grow in 5 days, and generally
reach 0.5 cm at 20th day; 2. If hair is burned off, it should not carry hair
follicle, while actually most of the hairs fall off with hair follicles thicker
than hair; 3. If it burns off hair, the original hair will grow naturally. It’s
impossible to have a lot of new hair grow when stop using WanBinCell for 1 to 2
months. The truth is after using WanBinCell for 20 days, then stop, new hair
will grow unceasingly after 1 to 2 month.</p>
<p><b>Why Hair Regrowth Takes Such a
Long Time?</b></p>
<p>It has been found that it takes
about 1 to 2 years to recover to no hair loss appearance by using WanBinCell.
Since WanBinCell do not require continuous use, the overall use time is about 1
year. Hair regrowth is a big challenge. Before our in situ tissue regeneration
technology, hair transplant surgery, as an effective means, requires more than
six months to achieve hair regrowth. The first 3 months is shedding period and
other 3 months growing period. Actually it takes 8 months for hair to grow in
all transplant area. Our in situ tissue regeneration technology solves two hair
loss problems: create hair follicle regeneration space and stimulate hair
follicle stem cells to regenerate hair follicles. Even so, as an aging problem,
hair loss cannot be solved in 1 to 2 months. In the consideration of hair loss
usually lasting time of 5 to 10 years and hair loss area are completely
different from healthy area, it is reasonable to rebuild a new healthy in 1-2
years. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Are Other Drugs Needed when Using
WanBinCell?</b></p>
<p>WanBinCell can fully solve hair
loss from essential problem. Long-term use can cure hair loss. Therefore it’s
not recommended to use other drugs together, but we suggest to use plum needle.
If used properly, it is quite beneficial to hair (for example, knocking as
heavily as possible to make scalp bleed if pain could be tolerated).</p>
<p><b>What Advantages of Using Plum
Needle?</b></p>
<p>One difficulty of Androgenetic
alopecia treatment is how to provide physical space for the generation of new
hair follicles. Although WanBinCell can make tiny wounds, but the size and
number of wounds could not reach the requirements of fast hair regrowth. We
have learned that man-made large wounds of hair transplant surgery can theoretically
accelerate hair follicle regeneration process. So when knocking head with plum
needle, we suggest that if you can tolerate, please knock as heavily as
possible and make scalp bleed. There is no need to worry about the infection of
wounds, because WanBinCell contains a substance similar to the ROS, a material
could avoid infection and accelerate wound healing.</p>
<p><b>Is WanBinCell Safe?</b></p>
<p>WanBinCell had been inspected by
qualified inspection agency, conforming to the safety specifications, and is a
special cosmetic product examined and approved by State Food and Drug
Administration of China. Actually we have done a more rigorous safety testing,
therefore we can confirm that WanBinCell can be taken orally or by
intramuscular injection without any side effects (<a href=""https://vimeo.com/123405399?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=clip-transcode_complete-finished-20120100&amp;utm_campaign=7701&amp;email_id=Y2xpcF90cmFuc2NvZGVkfDNlYzQ4ZWU5ODU5MTdkNjU0Y2U0YWIyOGIzNjAwZDlhMzU3fDM4NzQ5NTUzfDE0Mjc0NjU0ODl8NzcwMQ%3D%3D"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""https://vimeo.com/123405399"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">watch the video of the inventor test WanBinCell safety on himself</a>).</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F123405399&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F123405399&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F512732593_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why Using WanBinCell could Cause Piercing Pain? Is
It Unqualified As Cosmetics?</b></p>
<p>Having
no space for the new hair follicle is the key problem of hair loss. So solving
the problem of hair loss must create space for new hair follicles. It’s a
logical thinking that WanBinCell use chemicals to create tiny wounds. Wounds
will naturally bring pain which shouldn’t be thought as a standard to judge for
good cosmetics. In the United States, WanBinCell has to be put on the
market as a medicine. We have applied for a patent in the United States. Piercing pain is an
important mechanism process of medicine, rather than side effect.</p>
<p><b>Why Need 1-2 Years to Get Fully
Recovery?</b></p>
<p>Androgenetic alopecia is one of
the forms of aging, which develops relatively slow, generally obvious hair loss
takes five to ten years to appear. It has long disease course and treatment
time. There is still no very effective treatment for Androgenetic alopecia
except hair transplant surgery with relatively fast effect (recovery also needs
about 8 months), Minoxidil and Finasteride need longer time to take effect, and
need to be applied for a long time. Comparatively speaking, WanBinCell
technology is also the most rapid one by only taking 1-2 years to recover.</p>

ensuring hair regrowth appearance in just five days. The material is designed
as cosmetics and acquired special cosmetics qualification in China. For the
material’s hair regrowth function, we have already applied for the patent in
China, United States, European Union and Japan.
Androgenetic alopeciais a problem which
50% men and 10% women will be faced. Aging process faced by each person could initiate
with hair loss for some people. Same with aging, hair loss is also a difficult
medical problem. Our hair regrowth invention (US2015/0004254A1) has potential to thoroughly solve
hair loss problem, and are likely to offer a cure idea for other complicated
diseases. Our products are put on the market as special cosmetics in China
(similar to Quasi-Drug Label in Japan), but special cosmetics cannot be
advertised as a drug for treating hair loss problem, so the product won’t be
known by customers or recognized by doctors even it can solve the problem of
hair loss. That’s the reason we decide to apply to the FDA for investigational
new drug (IND) and new drug applications (NDA).Why Do We Want
Crowdfunding?
About
two out of ten Chinese adult males experience hair loss, while about one out of
twenty adult women does. Therefore in China it is estimated that there are 65
million men and 15 million women are suffering hair loss. In the United States
about four out of seven adult males are suffering hair loss.
There
are an estimated 40 million men and 12 million women experiencing some degree
of hair loss in the United States alone. Two-thirds of American men will see
the affects of Androgenetic alopecia by the age of 35.In order to meet
such a large market demand, we decided to launch this crowdfunding.
The
crowdfunding will be used for the production, while the rest of the money will
be used for preclinical study, phase I clinical research and application to the
FDA for clinical tests.
The cost of FDA application for preclinical trials and phase I
clinical study is estimated as $2 million. We will raise funds by crowdfunding
and fill the gap by other means.
Reasons for Androgenetic
Alopecia
Male hormone
translates into DHT which will block the hair follicle regeneration. DHT can
make obstacles in the process of hair follicle stem cells translating into hair
follicle cells, preventing hair follicle regeneration, thus regenerated hair
follicles keep shrinking until disappear. 
The study found
that hair follicle stem cells in hair loss area are normal, so hair follicle
stem cells loss is not the main cause of hair loss (learn more about the study).
There are two
possible ways of DHT blocking hair follicle regeneration process: 1. DHT leads
to the hyperplasia and enlargement of sebaceous gland near the top of  head, as with DHT leads to the prostate
enlargement of male, which squeezes the survival space of the hair follicles,
therefore stopping hair follicle regeneration after normal falling off; 2.
After the cycle of hair follicle anagen, catagen and telogen, the body will
give hair follicle stem cells the right stimulation signal, initiating the hair
follicle stem cells regeneration process but DHT accumulation interferes or
disrupts the signal transmission, thus blocking the regeneration process of
hair follicle stem cells differentiating into hair follicle cells.Both two ways lead
to the same result: sebaceous gland cells encroach on the space of hair
follicles, thus hair loss area is not only very oily (that’s why every hair
loser has this problem), and making hair follicle regeneration lose physical
space and more difficult.Androgenetic Alopecia
Treatment Difficulties
1. How to make physical space for hair follicles. The long process of hair loss with hair follicles falling off,
and sebaceous glands cells gradually occupy the space of the hair follicle. The
simple physical logic tells us that physical space must be made for hair
follicle for its regeneration. If see some effective hair regrowth
technologies, such as hair transplant surgery, you will find the most simple
idea of providing specific space for hair follicle is man-made wound.
The study found that man-made wound healing process will produce
new hair follicle stem cells group and new hair (learn more about the study).
From hair transplant surgery we will find that hair follicles in
transplantation area can regenerate after being removed. But in the hair loss
area, making new pores and transplanting new hair follicles which all fall off
after 3 months. The regenerated hair follicles in hair loss area should have
nothing to do with transplanted hair follicles. The man-made bigger wound for
new pore is the key to regenerate hair follicles in hair transplant surgery.
Talents of Chinese people with traditional Chinese medicine
experience and exploration also provide an effective way of hair regrowth. That
is using plum needle to knock on the head. Almost all Chinese medicine hair
regrowth shops, no matter what kind of Chinese traditional medicine they choose
use plum needle head knocking as supplementary means. In fact, knocking on the
head with plum needle is the only solution of hair regrowth that might work. Because
plum needle which knocking on the hair loss area can make a lot of wounds. Even
without stem cells stimulation, it may also be accompanied by new hair follicle
regeneration during the wounds heal.
2. How to initiate hair follicles regeneration by hair follicle stem
cells. Modern medicines generally use cytokines to stimulate stem cell
regeneration process. The special stem cells need special cytokines to
stimulate them. But now there is no broad spectrum stimulating factor being
found.How Does
WanBinCell work?WanBinCell
initiative in situ tissue regeneration technology is to cure hair loss by
aiming at the two difficulties of Androgenetic alopecia treatment, and is able
to cure quickly and keep a long-term health. 
In situ tissue regeneration technology is to initiate body’s original stem cell proliferation, migration
and differentiation by external physical or chemical means, thus fulfill
regeneration of new healthy tissues.
In Situ Tissue Regeneration Technology
Our
patent provides a method of initiating mammal’s stem cell proliferation,
migration and differentiation. This method can persistently initiate in situ
stem cells proliferation, migration and differentiation with minimal or no side
effects. We have not only developed the theory of “in situ tissue
regeneration”, but also invented the method which can timely initiate tissue
regeneration of stem cells near damaged tissues, so as to cure the disease or
restore young tissues. (learn more about the in situ tissue regeneration technology patent).

Mechanism
Drugs(stem cell initiators) are used on the
targeted aging or damage tissues. Stem cell initiators will initiate healthy
tissue regeneration of stem cells through three functions: 1. Stem cell
initiators remove damaged or senescent cells, and make specific space for
tissue regeneration; 2. Stem cell initiators as exogenous gas signal molecule activate
stem cell proliferation, migration and differentiation; 3. Stem cell initiators
regulate the immune response, to avoid infection. Under the
induce of specific space, damaged tissues or surrounded normal stem cells
regenerate new functional young tissues through proliferation, migration and
differentiation. Impaired cells are removed as making room for tissue
regeneration. Disease is cured and young tissues are restored by new tissues
replacing impaired ones.
Further
studies have indicated that stem cell initiator is a substance similar to ROS. Targeted
drug delivery is equivalent to supplement exogenous similar ROS compounds into the target tissue. The latest study has
found that improving the level of ROS could accelerate apoptosis of cancer
cells and reach the goal of anticancer（For example:1. Targeting Oxidative Stress in Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma; 2. Antioxidants Accelerate Lung Cancer
Progression in Mice; 3. Selective
killing of cancer cells with a small molecule targeting stress response to ROS; 4. Breaking the depth dependency of phototherapy with
Cerenkov radiation and low-radiance-responsive nanophotosensitizers.）; improving ROS could regulate immune response and treat autoimmune
diseases(For example: 1. A New Arthritis
Therapy with Oxidative Burst Inducers; 2. Eriocalyxin B ameliorates
experimental autoimmune ncephalomyelitis by suppressing Th1 and Th17 cells.);
increasing ROS level contributes to tissue regeneration(For example: 1. Amputation-induced
reactive oxygen species are required for successful Xenopus tadpole tail
regeneration; 2. Sustained production
of ROS triggers compensatory proliferation and is required for regeneration to
proceed). The three patents we applied cover three possible mechanisms
of ROS, suggesting that the substance which similar to ROS can play the same
role of ROS. We applied apoptosis inducer patent for substance similar to ROS (learn more about
apoptosis inducer patent) used for anti-aging and tumor treatment.Advantages of In Situ Tissue Regeneration Technology
It
is a kind of stem cell therapy which makes full use of stem cell regeneration
ability; Stem cells can be found in any tissue, so we can initiate in situ stem
cells with no need of transplant; No need of complicated process of selection
and induction; Make full use of original stem cell micro environment; No
carcinogenicity and won’t cause immune rejection; Simple, high success rate,
widely used, low cost and convenient.How Does WanBinCell Hair-Growth-Promoting Solution
Regrow Hair?
WanBinCell
contains the substance which can activate the hair follicle stem cells to
regenerate, having two key functions in the process of hair regrowth: 1. Make
tiny wounds thus providing specific space for new hair follicles; 2. activate
hair follicle stem cells in hair loss area and grow new healthy hair follicles.
Through
experiment, WanBinCell has the following characteristics: regrow new hair in
about 5 days; in half bald area, fierce hair loss period shall appear by the
accelerated falling off (the severe shedding period )of original hair
especially the thin ones, then new hair regrow; in bald area, new hair regrowth
takes a longer time of about 1 to 3 months; no matter what the degree of hair
loss is, WanBinCell shall be used for more than over one year to make sure of
no hair loss appearance.What Does
WanBinCell Bring to the World?
In
situ tissue regeneration technique has made a great breakthrough in traditional
stem cell therapy. It can be applied as a clinical therapy immediately. It
makes full use of the potential of stem cell regeneration which could cure many
difficult diseases. Combined with apoptosis inducer patent technology, it is
more powerful in anti-aging and cancer treatment.

Why WanBinCell Works So Quickly?
New hair can
regrow in about 5 days in half bald area. This is because WanBinCell contains stem cell initiators factors. They penetrate scalp, reach hair follicle stem
cells, and stimulate the stem cells to grow new hair follicles. Wound will heal
in 5 days, with the factors, new hair follicles could regeneration 5 days. In
half bald area, hair follicles and their living space still exist, therefore
new hair follicles have space to grow quickly.
Why It has Slower Effect in Bald Area?
In
bald area, there are almost no hair follicles; their space has been taken up by
sebaceous gland cells. Even there are stem cell regeneration stimulate factors,
it is impossible to have regenerated hair follicles because of the limited
physical space. So it works slowly in bald area. But by continuously creating man-made
micro wounds, hair follicles will have physical space for survival. Generally
in 1 to 3 months, healthy thick new hair can regrow even in
bald area.
Why Have Severe Shedding Period? Can it Be Avoided? 
Physical
space is still the key point to solve the problem of Androgenetic alopecia. Because
there are limited physical space and old hair follicles have not been cleared,
new hair follicles could not regenerate. Natural regeneration of hair follicles
is a process that new hair follicles replace old hair follicles which are in telogen.
In fact, severe Shedding of hair exists in all effective products, such as
Minoxidil and Finasteride. In the first 3 months after an effective hair
transplant surgery, hairs grow from new transplant hair follicles will fall off
entirely. Now it is inevitable and must be accepted. This period also has
psychological impact. Different from transplant surgery, using WanBinCell does
not need to shave all the old hair. Shedding period especially long hair fall
off give shocks, while new hair grow in the speed of 1mm/3 days.

How Woman Avoid Severe Shedding Period?
Due
to woman’s hair loss generally is not as serious as man, we recommend you to
use plum needle and reduce the use time of WanBinCell. For example use WanBinCell
for one week (7 days), select one day from this week to knock head with plum
needle, then stop for a week, and keep doing it. Even men can use this method
to avoid Shedding period. For men who can accept the period, using plum needle once
a week is also helpful.
Severe Shedding Periods Due to Hair Being Burned
off?
Because
of the need to make tiny wounds, WanBinCell has a little corrosion effect.
Corrosion effect is similar to hydrogen peroxide used in dyeing, but won’t burn
out the hair for the following reasons: 1. If WanBinCell burns off hair, new
hair won’t appear when using it. Even new hairs appear, it will not continue to
grow. If you use it for 20 days, new hair can grow in 5 days, and generally
reach 0.5 cm at 20th day; 2. If hair is burned off, it should not carry hair
follicle, while actually most of the hairs fall off with hair follicles thicker
than hair; 3. If it burns off hair, the original hair will grow naturally. It’s
impossible to have a lot of new hair grow when stop using WanBinCell for 1 to 2
months. The truth is after using WanBinCell for 20 days, then stop, new hair
will grow unceasingly after 1 to 2 month.
Why Hair Regrowth Takes Such a
Long Time?
It has been found that it takes
about 1 to 2 years to recover to no hair loss appearance by using WanBinCell.
Since WanBinCell do not require continuous use, the overall use time is about 1
year. Hair regrowth is a big challenge. Before our in situ tissue regeneration
technology, hair transplant surgery, as an effective means, requires more than
six months to achieve hair regrowth. The first 3 months is shedding period and
other 3 months growing period. Actually it takes 8 months for hair to grow in
all transplant area. Our in situ tissue regeneration technology solves two hair
loss problems: create hair follicle regeneration space and stimulate hair
follicle stem cells to regenerate hair follicles. Even so, as an aging problem,
hair loss cannot be solved in 1 to 2 months. In the consideration of hair loss
usually lasting time of 5 to 10 years and hair loss area are completely
different from healthy area, it is reasonable to rebuild a new healthy in 1-2
years. 

Are Other Drugs Needed when Using
WanBinCell?
WanBinCell can fully solve hair
loss from essential problem. Long-term use can cure hair loss. Therefore it’s
not recommended to use other drugs together, but we suggest to use plum needle.
If used properly, it is quite beneficial to hair (for example, knocking as
heavily as possible to make scalp bleed if pain could be tolerated).
What Advantages of Using Plum
Needle?
One difficulty of Androgenetic
alopecia treatment is how to provide physical space for the generation of new
hair follicles. Although WanBinCell can make tiny wounds, but the size and
number of wounds could not reach the requirements of fast hair regrowth. We
have learned that man-made large wounds of hair transplant surgery can theoretically
accelerate hair follicle regeneration process. So when knocking head with plum
needle, we suggest that if you can tolerate, please knock as heavily as
possible and make scalp bleed. There is no need to worry about the infection of
wounds, because WanBinCell contains a substance similar to the ROS, a material
could avoid infection and accelerate wound healing.
Is WanBinCell Safe?
WanBinCell had been inspected by
qualified inspection agency, conforming to the safety specifications, and is a
special cosmetic product examined and approved by State Food and Drug
Administration of China. Actually we have done a more rigorous safety testing,
therefore we can confirm that WanBinCell can be taken orally or by
intramuscular injection without any side effects (watch the video of the inventor test WanBinCell safety on himself).

Why Using WanBinCell could Cause Piercing Pain? Is
It Unqualified As Cosmetics?
Having
no space for the new hair follicle is the key problem of hair loss. So solving
the problem of hair loss must create space for new hair follicles. It’s a
logical thinking that WanBinCell use chemicals to create tiny wounds. Wounds
will naturally bring pain which shouldn’t be thought as a standard to judge for
good cosmetics. In the United States, WanBinCell has to be put on the
market as a medicine. We have applied for a patent in the United States. Piercing pain is an
important mechanism process of medicine, rather than side effect.
Why Need 1-2 Years to Get Fully
Recovery?
Androgenetic alopecia is one of
the forms of aging, which develops relatively slow, generally obvious hair loss
takes five to ten years to appear. It has long disease course and treatment
time. There is still no very effective treatment for Androgenetic alopecia
except hair transplant surgery with relatively fast effect (recovery also needs
about 8 months), Minoxidil and Finasteride need longer time to take effect, and
need to be applied for a long time. Comparatively speaking, WanBinCell
technology is also the most rapid one by only taking 1-2 years to recover.

<p><b>FAQ:</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b>
<b>How long does a NMS-Clip last for?</b></p>
<p>
The materials used (polycaprolactone, polypropylene and polyamide) are not only very compatible but also very stable. For hygiene reasons though, we recommend to replace the NMS-Clip after about a year.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How should the NMS-Clip be maintained?</b></p>
<p>
After wearing it should be simply rinsed lukewarm, dried and kept dry &amp; cool in the supplied case until it is reapplied in the evening. We recommend using a commercially available denture cleaner every 14 days. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Where has the effectiveness of the NMS-Clip been checked?</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>The clip has been clinically tested in the sleep laboratory of Dr. Christoph Schenk in Osnabrueck, Germany. Out of 100 persons 84 completely stopped snoring, 8 experienced a massive reduction. Only on 8 people there was no impact detectable.</p>

<br/><br/></b><p>I Love Multi-edit! </p>
<p>I've been using it for approximately 28 years -- back in the early 
days, it was the only software that would open really large files, and 
it could SCROLL so fast!  Over the years, the ""build your own macro"" 
feature has saved me so much time!!  And the block edit, and the ASCII 
character map that pops up with Alt-A keystroke. I probably should do 
more than the $100 that I just contributed via Indiegogo.  I wrote the 
first draft of my dissertation in Multi-Edit!!</p>
<p>Jake Hershey, Ph.D.</p>
<br/>Please help us to complete this amazing rebuild of Multi-Edit, without your help we simply won't be able to fund the completion of this project and Multi-Edit will not have any future builds.  Please share our campaign with everyone you can if you are unable to contribute and thank you from all of us at Multi Edit Software!<br/><br/><br/>**Update<br/>We've had a number of request for smaller reward options so we've added $1.00, $5.00 and $10.00 reward levels.<br/><br/><br/>Let ME
Help YOU!<br/><br/>
<p>Hello! My name is <b>Chad Williams</b>, <b>President and CEO</b> of <b>Multi Edit Software, Inc.</b> and I am here to tell you about our new product called <b>Multi-Edit <sup>x</sup></b> or <b><b>ME<sup>x</sup></b></b>.<span>  <br/></span></p><p><span>We developed <b>Multi-Edit</b> in order to provide a powerful, quality programming
environment that supports over 50 programming languages from standard .txt
files to programming languages both new and old.  <br/></span></p><p><span>With years of market presence and an existing user base, we have no doubt this release will help the Programming/Text Editing Community who is always in need of a solution for quality editor for a fraction
of the price of the Big Dogs but with the same POWER many have come to know and love.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><b><i>-Want to code better, cleaner and
faster?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>-Looking for a code or text editor with
amazing speed and power?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>-Tired of all those other editors that
look, feel and operate the way THEY want it to and NOT the way YOU code or edit?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>-Frustrated with the limited support for
your programming languages?</i></b></p>
<p>If you’re a programmer or frequently
edit those plain ugly improperly formatted files, then you likely have answered
<b>YES </b>to most of our questions above, and YOU can help Multi-Edit to once again be the
<b>BEST </b>editor in the world!</p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>Anyone who has encountered it knows
that improperly formatted text files are a pain. We're out to change this by
once again, providing the best editor on the market! <br/></p><p>Help us establish this initiative to
serve the Development Community in need of a solution.  <span>Empower us to
make this vision a reality with a donation to this project today!</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><b>                     Screenshot of <b>Multi-Edit</b> (currently available release)</b><br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1392625/files/20150417131057-snap6.jpg?1429301457"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b><br/><br/>More about the Project</b><p></p>
<p><b>Multi-Edit</b> over these past
years has struggled to hold its edge in the market as the larger corporate
owned editors with ample funding have surpassed the features of <b>Multi-Edit</b>.  This fact
prompted us to dig deeper for a long term solution.<span>  <br/></span></p><p><span>This is where we started to envision <b>Multi-Edit <sup>x</sup></b> and all the possible benefits we could bring to the Development Community:</span></p><p><span></span>

</blockquote>
<p>When
reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us
that this is a business that needs to be created. We know that when executed properly
we can reach a large market of people in need of an easy, more productive way to code with
amazing speed and power.<span>  <br/></span></p><p><span>Our features
will make us incredibly qualified to once again succeed in the software industry.  This paired with attention to detail and
quality service will make us a key player if not leader in the Programming and Text Editor market once again. <br/></span></p><p><span>Our mission is to take care of every crowd funder, supporter and customer with the utmost respect and care.  We fully understand this
will be the key to our growth.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><b>What is our funding goal and where will the funding go towards?</b></p>
<p>In order for
us to complete the <b>Multi-Edit <sup>x</sup></b>
Windows release we are looking to raise $200,000 which will be enough to hire a qualified development team to complete <b>ME<sup>x</sup></b> for Windows build.

If funding exceeds our goal, we’ll not only complete the <b>Multi-Edit <sup>x</sup></b> for Windows release, but will then split our development team in two directions. One team will maintain the Windows build and continue to add and enhance features, while the other team will begin our first ever Linux build. <br/></p><p>As we continue to progress and if funding exceeds our expectations, we’ll move forward to our planned Mac build as well and eventually offer a mobile release or both portable drive use as well as a Phone App version of <b>Multi-Edit</b>. <br/></p><p>Following the release of the Windows, Linux and Mac builds, we’ll focus on
enhancing our framework to become a ‘stand-alone’ product to allow others to
utilize the power and functionality we’ve created to use for other software
projects that require a SOLID base framework for programming/text editing
needs. <br/></p><p>We also have defined projects to begin creating custom language parsers to allow users to utilize other languages such as RUBY, Python, Java etc. to write  powerful macros that will be interpreted to use <b>Multi-Edit's</b> built in <b>CMac</b> language. This will allow users/programmers the ability to create full-fledged add-ons without the need to learn <b>Multi-Edit's</b> <b>CMac</b> language. <br/></p><p><b><br/></b></p>    <b>See Multi-Edit in action in a video Tutorial on using Projects and Sessions</b><br/>    <div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FWAiGhgeIMiw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWAiGhgeIMiw&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FWAiGhgeIMiw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<br/></div>","06/05/15We've received MANY 'Good Lucks' and Testimonials from existing users since we began this campaign nearly a month ago and I wanted to share another with you today.  Hi Chad / Multi-Edit!
I Love Multi-edit! 
I've been using it for approximately 28 years -- back in the early 
days, it was the only software that would open really large files, and 
it could SCROLL so fast!  Over the years, the ""build your own macro"" 
feature has saved me so much time!!  And the block edit, and the ASCII 
character map that pops up with Alt-A keystroke. I probably should do 
more than the $100 that I just contributed via Indiegogo.  I wrote the 
first draft of my dissertation in Multi-Edit!!
Jake Hershey, Ph.D.
Please help us to complete this amazing rebuild of Multi-Edit, without your help we simply won't be able to fund the completion of this project and Multi-Edit will not have any future builds.  Please share our campaign with everyone you can if you are unable to contribute and thank you from all of us at Multi Edit Software!**UpdateWe've had a number of request for smaller reward options so we've added $1.00, $5.00 and $10.00 reward levels.Let ME
Help YOU!
Hello! My name is Chad Williams, President and CEO of Multi Edit Software, Inc. and I am here to tell you about our new product called Multi-Edit x or MEx.  We developed Multi-Edit in order to provide a powerful, quality programming
environment that supports over 50 programming languages from standard .txt
files to programming languages both new and old.  With years of market presence and an existing user base, we have no doubt this release will help the Programming/Text Editing Community who is always in need of a solution for quality editor for a fraction
of the price of the Big Dogs but with the same POWER many have come to know and love.
-Want to code better, cleaner and
faster?
-Looking for a code or text editor with
amazing speed and power?
-Tired of all those other editors that
look, feel and operate the way THEY want it to and NOT the way YOU code or edit?
-Frustrated with the limited support for
your programming languages?
If you’re a programmer or frequently
edit those plain ugly improperly formatted files, then you likely have answered
YES to most of our questions above, and YOU can help Multi-Edit to once again be the
BEST editor in the world!
Overview
Anyone who has encountered it knows
that improperly formatted text files are a pain. We're out to change this by
once again, providing the best editor on the market! Help us establish this initiative to
serve the Development Community in need of a solution.  Empower us to
make this vision a reality with a donation to this project today!                     Screenshot of Multi-Edit (currently available release)More about the Project
Multi-Edit over these past
years has struggled to hold its edge in the market as the larger corporate
owned editors with ample funding have surpassed the features of Multi-Edit.  This fact
prompted us to dig deeper for a long term solution.  This is where we started to envision Multi-Edit x and all the possible benefits we could bring to the Development Community:

 We created a new design for Multi-Edit x  with an entirely new framework that will allow it to once again become the powerful machine it was originally designed to be. Newly designed Multi-Edit framework will ultimately be released as a  powerful stand alone product allowing developers in need of  basic editor framework to be easily integrated to custom products/programs.
 Provide the familiar user interface to
function as before with a new and powerful engine.  Eliminate limitations such as: No cross
platform support (currently only available as a Windows product), no Unicode support and therefore no ability to provide multi-language support for other countries as well as additional limitations that simply couldn’t be overcome with our existing outdated framework.

When
reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us
that this is a business that needs to be created. We know that when executed properly
we can reach a large market of people in need of an easy, more productive way to code with
amazing speed and power.  Our features
will make us incredibly qualified to once again succeed in the software industry.  This paired with attention to detail and
quality service will make us a key player if not leader in the Programming and Text Editor market once again. Our mission is to take care of every crowd funder, supporter and customer with the utmost respect and care.  We fully understand this
will be the key to our growth.
What is our funding goal and where will the funding go towards?
In order for
us to complete the Multi-Edit x
Windows release we are looking to raise $200,000 which will be enough to hire a qualified development team to complete MEx for Windows build.

If funding exceeds our goal, we’ll not only complete the Multi-Edit x for Windows release, but will then split our development team in two directions. One team will maintain the Windows build and continue to add and enhance features, while the other team will begin our first ever Linux build. As we continue to progress and if funding exceeds our expectations, we’ll move forward to our planned Mac build as well and eventually offer a mobile release or both portable drive use as well as a Phone App version of Multi-Edit. Following the release of the Windows, Linux and Mac builds, we’ll focus on
enhancing our framework to become a ‘stand-alone’ product to allow others to
utilize the power and functionality we’ve created to use for other software
projects that require a SOLID base framework for programming/text editing
needs. We also have defined projects to begin creating custom language parsers to allow users to utilize other languages such as RUBY, Python, Java etc. to write  powerful macros that will be interpreted to use Multi-Edit's built in CMac language. This will allow users/programmers the ability to create full-fledged add-ons without the need to learn Multi-Edit's CMac language.     See Multi-Edit in action in a video Tutorial on using Projects and Sessions    

Who uses Multi-Edit might be asking yourself?  That's a very GOOD question and since Multi-Edit has been around since DOS, that's a HUGE list of licensed users to reference. 

Currently there are licensed Multi-Edit Users in 79 countries and we currently manage 51 authorized resellers located in 37 countries across the globe. Below we've provided a list of some of our customers who you're likely to recognize, but our Licensed User base extends well beyond these Customers!                         A small sample of Current Multi-Edit license holders

""Multi-Edit is the most useful tool I have ever had for programming, which I've been using since the early 1990s (COBOL and FORTRAN, lol).  Over the years, it has saved my life many times over with the powerful search/sort/select functions and the file compare feature, to name just a few.  Thanks for sticking around, I am really looking forward to a new release!""Jennifer M.""I love Multi-Edit, I use it for everything, right now oracle PL/SQL and ASP. The most fun feature is the block operations and being able to easily go into someone else's code and get everything aligned and indented properly...other most important features are just too numerous to list!Thanks for your great product!""Sean L""I have used Multi-Edit for ‘some years’ – mostly because it is very flexible with how you are able to open a file several times and show different parts of the same code file at the same time and because search is so super fast … Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down is so nice!""Jesper G.""There is no one best feature in Multi-Edit. There are just so many great features (Multi-tags, compiler integration, session manager, bookmarks, file search,) that just make Multi-Edit the best. I’ve used Multi-Edit ever since I was introduced to the DOS version back in 1992. I’ve worked several companies since then and have used Multi-Edit as my foundation for embedded code development. Multi-Edit’s integrity, flexibility and easy of use, has made the editor an indispensable tool.""Ron S""While there are a lot of things I like about ME, I suppose the single most important thing is that the source for most of the program is included, letting me extend it to my little heart's content. I include in this the built-in template facility, as well as the extensible macro language and the way it lets you integrate functionality into the program in a way indistinguishable from the shipped interface. As an example, I'm in the process of putting together a fairly messy and massive set of C++ extensions for ME. These are for my own use, but if I get them to a decent production level, I see no reason not to share with others. And that's the cherry that caps my comments; since everyone can modify the program, some really nice, often unusual mods can end up in the shipped product.""Reid S.""I use ME every day for my work and it is my primary editor.  I'm stuck on the old style Wordstar keyboard layout with some scripts of my own design that extend its capabilities.  What interests me most is to see ME extended into the Linux market so that I can have one editor for both environments.""Chris F.""I have been using Multi-Edit since my DOS days of programming in dBASE/Clipper and using Evolve.  I use Multi-Edit primarily on HTML and PERL scripts.  I fuss and complain when I have to use Visual Studio’s editor for its lack of features.  I have written a few macros and tweaked the templates to meet my specific programming needs.  On a good day, I’ve spent all my time in ME.""James C.

<p></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Journey</b></h2><p>MMA, with its convergence of techniques brings the entirety of
martial arts to a new level.  But
over time, I found I needed more. I needed a way to know that what I’m <b>learning
is quality training</b> and <b>suitable to my body type</b>, <b>skill level,
learning style, and attention to detail.</b> </p>
<p>That’s why I found it strange, in this day and age, that my
coaches told me not to look online for the answers. What were my coaches trying
to protect me from? </p>
<p>Then I realized, in this information super age, with any and all
people posting techniques online, making DVDs, and writing books, <b>it is
tough to know who really knows what they are talking about. </b></p>

The JourneyMMA, with its convergence of techniques brings the entirety of
martial arts to a new level.  But
over time, I found I needed more. I needed a way to know that what I’m learning
is quality training and suitable to my body type, skill level,
learning style, and attention to detail. 
That’s why I found it strange, in this day and age, that my
coaches told me not to look online for the answers. What were my coaches trying
to protect me from? 
Then I realized, in this information super age, with any and all
people posting techniques online, making DVDs, and writing books, it is
tough to know who really knows what they are talking about. 

 I knew I had to solve this problem by making Martial
Arts Training available to everyone!

for visually impaired</u></b></h1>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Since 2011, a diagnostic tool, titled
UMACE (Universal Memory and Cognitive Exam) has been tested on more than 350
samples comprising normal (literate and illiterate), psychiatric and
neurological patients rendering substantial quantitative and qualitative data. In
an ambitious attempt to empower and support people through innovative methods, the
creator of UMACE, Mangal Kardile, a researcher from the City of Nashik in
India, seeks to further improve this existing tool to analyze memory and
cognitive impairment of the visually impaired population around the globe. </p>
<p>With a growing concern regarding an
increase in the number of people affected by Alzheimer’s &amp; Dementia in
India with an alarming 10 million + patients by the year 2020 (Kounteya Sinha, TNN, 2009, based on global dementia &amp; aging reports
by, WHO, NIH, NIA and ADI, ARDSI), the researcher initiated her project with
the help of local psychiatrists and neurologists in 2011. This project
concluded in mid-2014 and was accomplished in three phases.</p>
<p>The
development of UMACE started in June 2011 when it raised the need for an
instrument that could be used to detect cognitive impairments in the illiterate
population while developing a technology based therapy for dementia. The
therapy research work was carried out using available MMSE test with minimal
number of participants and the research paper titled: “Cohesion of Cognitive
and Technological inference for treating Dementia” was presented in - The Fifth
International congress of the Asian Society Against Dementia, Jointly organized
by - Asian Society against Dementia, The Chinese Dementia Research Association,
The Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists— Hong Kong, Nov. 2011</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
UMACE diagnostic tool for memory and cognitive impairments has been developed
in three different phases.</span></p>
<p>*
First phase – Development of items with a diagnostic kit with verbal and
non-verbal tasks with the statistical assessment for tool validity, comparing
UMACE with MMSE with two Normal sample groups (Literate and Illiterate N=78).</p>
<p>The
research paper based on these studies was presented in Australia 2012. Title -
“Using a Multicultural Model to develop an Universal Diagnostic Tool for
Cognitive and Memory Impairments” International Psychogeriatric Association
International Meeting, Cairns, Australia, 7-11 September, 2012</p>
<p>*
Second phase - The UMACE testing was performed for a group of 35 male and
female patients with varied psychiatric disorders in a private psychiatric
clinic using the original UMACE item structure and was compared with MMSE with
a group of 35 male and female Normal population (N=70)</p>
<p>*
Third phase - In the third phase different neurological disorder groups were
administered in a private neurology clinic (total 7 groups- Vertigo, Migraine
with and without aura, Epilepsy &amp; Seizure disorder, Stroke, Parkinson,
Brain diseases, Other neurological disorders) for 205 neurological disorder
patients. This study excluded the patients previously diagnosed with Alzheimer’s
&amp; Dementia.</p>
<p>The
additional test assessment functions are added in the third phase to assess the
patients with Stroke or similar disorder having disabilities in speech and
motor coordination.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The above mentioned UMACE diagnostic
tool research work has been carried out by the researcher through her own expenses
owing to the lack of funding opportunities in India for this particular
venture. At the final stage the researcher was awarded AUD 3500, through “Capacity
Australia”, an NGO run by experienced and eminent psychogeriatricians in Sydney,
Australia. Through these funds, she was able to continue
the publication process for UMACE. The current UMACE diagnostic tool is suitable
to assess all people having no cut off criteria based on education or
disability, except for the visually impaired and persons having an IQ below 70.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>About
the UMACE-VIP tool</b></p>
<p>Further the
researcher has been developing a tool for visually impaired population, named as
UMACE-VIP (UMACE- Visually Impaired) to detect memory and cognitive impairments
as India <strong><span>shoulders the largest burden of
global blindness, about 15 million across the country (38 million visually
impaired worldwide) with 30000 new cases being added each year. </span></strong>The
75% of these cases are of avoidable blindness, but India has acute shortage of
optometrists, while India needs 40,000 optometrists, it has only 8,000 (<a href=""http://www.netradaan.com/blind-statistics-india.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.netradaan.com/blind-statistics-india...</a>). <br/>
The global population about 38 million persons at present who are blind and, by
definition, cannot walk about unaided. They are usually in need of vocational
and/or social support.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1375943/files/20150412022904-productphoto.jpg?1428830944"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>
<br/></p><p></p><b>Necessity for Tool Development</b>
<p>285
million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide: 39 million are
blind and 246 have low vision. About 90% of the world's visually impaired live
in low-income settings (Visual impairment and blindness Fact Sheet, WHO, N°282, 2014). One out of every three blind people in the world lives in India (Anugraha Drishtidaan, 2013, <a href=""http://www.anugrahadrishtidaan.org/Blindness-Global-&amp;-Indian-Scenario.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.anugrahadrishtidaan.org/Blindness-Gl...</a>)<br/></p>
<p>Concerning the years lived with
disability for all types of non-communicable chronic diseases; the ages 60 +
blind population lives the longest years with disability which is 13.3 years
lived with disability (21.5% of old age), (World Alzheimer report, ADI, 2009) and
there has been little consideration regarding understanding how much percentage
of cognitive impairments might be present within this population when they are
already at the loss of a very important visual sensory information.</p>
<p>The
loss of sight causes enormous human suffering for the affected individuals and
their families. It also represents a public health, social and economic problem
for countries, especially the developing ones, where 9 out of 10 of the world's
blind live. In fact, around 60% of them reside in sub-Saharan Africa, China and
India. If additional resources are not urgently mobilized and efforts are not
made to curb this trend, by 2020 <i><span>the
global burden of blindness can double.</span></i> The developing countries will
bear the brunt (WHO, vision 2020, The right to sight).</p>
<p>Based on the above studies the
researcher has also created a memory and cognitive exercises kit for mild to
severe cognitive impairments caused by various neurological disorders and also comprising
special features for the visually impaired by which they could
be able to enhance the cognitive learning right from the childhood that could be useful for
future career skill development. The brain exercises kit will be in the market
soon with the name “BrainNext”. </p>
<p><b>The Importance of Human brain cognition<br/></b></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1375964/files/20150412024357-brainvisualinfo.jpg?1428831837"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The major sensory information in
humans is derived through visionary senses and visual perceptions. A person who
is visually impaired is deprived of this sensory information which blocks the
visual imagery cognitions that are normally stored and referred by the human
brain. The absence of visual information in the brain has proved to make a huge
difference in the memory and cognitive processes, more prominently, after the
age of 60. Other visual associations such as visuo-spatial coordination,
visuo-motor coordination, visuo-auditory, visuo-tactile and visuo-olfactory
could contribute to loss of major information, which is stored by the complex coordination between temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital
lobe. The cumulative information processing within these major parts of the human brain is
stored in short-term and long-term memory and is retrieved frequently by
working memory as and when required. 

<p>The UMACE-VIP tool has been primarily
developed to assess other important cognitive domains in the visually impaired
population such as audio-tactile-spatial-motor coordination.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How will this innovation make a
difference?</b></p>
<p>Currently, there are no specific diagnostic
tools available to detect memory and cognitive impairment among people who are
visually impaired; It is of utmost importance to prioritize this as the aging
blind population is gradually increasing on a global scale. Statistically, 82%
of people living with blindness are aged 50 and above, (Visual impairment and
blindness Fact Sheet, WHO, N°282, 2014)</p>
<h4>Utilization of funds</h4>
<p>The researcher is seeking funds to support
a sample study in India, concerning the development and assessment of the
visually impaired population, completing assessment of two groups of visually
impaired population- one which has lost vision since birth and the other
population which has lost vision after birth due to some reason. </p>
<p>These funds will be used to create the
diagnostic tool, develop a cognitive rehabilitation kit for the visually
impaired and conduct a free clinical assessment of 50 visually impaired
individuals for memory and cognitive impairments as well as assist in the
publication of the research findings and for raising awareness.</p>
<p>I appreciate your contribution towards
my mission of improving the quality of life globally, one individual at a time.

for visually impaired
Background
Since 2011, a diagnostic tool, titled
UMACE (Universal Memory and Cognitive Exam) has been tested on more than 350
samples comprising normal (literate and illiterate), psychiatric and
neurological patients rendering substantial quantitative and qualitative data. In
an ambitious attempt to empower and support people through innovative methods, the
creator of UMACE, Mangal Kardile, a researcher from the City of Nashik in
India, seeks to further improve this existing tool to analyze memory and
cognitive impairment of the visually impaired population around the globe. 
With a growing concern regarding an
increase in the number of people affected by Alzheimer’s & Dementia in
India with an alarming 10 million + patients by the year 2020 (Kounteya Sinha, TNN, 2009, based on global dementia & aging reports
by, WHO, NIH, NIA and ADI, ARDSI), the researcher initiated her project with
the help of local psychiatrists and neurologists in 2011. This project
concluded in mid-2014 and was accomplished in three phases.
The
development of UMACE started in June 2011 when it raised the need for an
instrument that could be used to detect cognitive impairments in the illiterate
population while developing a technology based therapy for dementia. The
therapy research work was carried out using available MMSE test with minimal
number of participants and the research paper titled: “Cohesion of Cognitive
and Technological inference for treating Dementia” was presented in - The Fifth
International congress of the Asian Society Against Dementia, Jointly organized
by - Asian Society against Dementia, The Chinese Dementia Research Association,
The Hong Kong College of Psychiatrists— Hong Kong, Nov. 2011

The
UMACE diagnostic tool for memory and cognitive impairments has been developed
in three different phases.
*
First phase – Development of items with a diagnostic kit with verbal and
non-verbal tasks with the statistical assessment for tool validity, comparing
UMACE with MMSE with two Normal sample groups (Literate and Illiterate N=78).
The
research paper based on these studies was presented in Australia 2012. Title -
“Using a Multicultural Model to develop an Universal Diagnostic Tool for
Cognitive and Memory Impairments” International Psychogeriatric Association
International Meeting, Cairns, Australia, 7-11 September, 2012
*
Second phase - The UMACE testing was performed for a group of 35 male and
female patients with varied psychiatric disorders in a private psychiatric
clinic using the original UMACE item structure and was compared with MMSE with
a group of 35 male and female Normal population (N=70)
*
Third phase - In the third phase different neurological disorder groups were
administered in a private neurology clinic (total 7 groups- Vertigo, Migraine
with and without aura, Epilepsy & Seizure disorder, Stroke, Parkinson,
Brain diseases, Other neurological disorders) for 205 neurological disorder
patients. This study excluded the patients previously diagnosed with Alzheimer’s
& Dementia.
The
additional test assessment functions are added in the third phase to assess the
patients with Stroke or similar disorder having disabilities in speech and
motor coordination.

The above mentioned UMACE diagnostic
tool research work has been carried out by the researcher through her own expenses
owing to the lack of funding opportunities in India for this particular
venture. At the final stage the researcher was awarded AUD 3500, through “Capacity
Australia”, an NGO run by experienced and eminent psychogeriatricians in Sydney,
Australia. Through these funds, she was able to continue
the publication process for UMACE. The current UMACE diagnostic tool is suitable
to assess all people having no cut off criteria based on education or
disability, except for the visually impaired and persons having an IQ below 70.

About
the UMACE-VIP tool
Further the
researcher has been developing a tool for visually impaired population, named as
UMACE-VIP (UMACE- Visually Impaired) to detect memory and cognitive impairments
as India shoulders the largest burden of
global blindness, about 15 million across the country (38 million visually
impaired worldwide) with 30000 new cases being added each year. The
75% of these cases are of avoidable blindness, but India has acute shortage of
optometrists, while India needs 40,000 optometrists, it has only 8,000 (http://www.netradaan.com/blind-statistics-india...). 
The global population about 38 million persons at present who are blind and, by
definition, cannot walk about unaided. They are usually in need of vocational
and/or social support.

Necessity for Tool Development
285
million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide: 39 million are
blind and 246 have low vision. About 90% of the world's visually impaired live
in low-income settings (Visual impairment and blindness Fact Sheet, WHO, N°282, 2014). One out of every three blind people in the world lives in India (Anugraha Drishtidaan, 2013, http://www.anugrahadrishtidaan.org/Blindness-Gl...)
Concerning the years lived with
disability for all types of non-communicable chronic diseases; the ages 60 +
blind population lives the longest years with disability which is 13.3 years
lived with disability (21.5% of old age), (World Alzheimer report, ADI, 2009) and
there has been little consideration regarding understanding how much percentage
of cognitive impairments might be present within this population when they are
already at the loss of a very important visual sensory information.
The
loss of sight causes enormous human suffering for the affected individuals and
their families. It also represents a public health, social and economic problem
for countries, especially the developing ones, where 9 out of 10 of the world's
blind live. In fact, around 60% of them reside in sub-Saharan Africa, China and
India. If additional resources are not urgently mobilized and efforts are not
made to curb this trend, by 2020 the
global burden of blindness can double. The developing countries will
bear the brunt (WHO, vision 2020, The right to sight).
Based on the above studies the
researcher has also created a memory and cognitive exercises kit for mild to
severe cognitive impairments caused by various neurological disorders and also comprising
special features for the visually impaired by which they could
be able to enhance the cognitive learning right from the childhood that could be useful for
future career skill development. The brain exercises kit will be in the market
soon with the name “BrainNext”. 
The Importance of Human brain cognition

The major sensory information in
humans is derived through visionary senses and visual perceptions. A person who
is visually impaired is deprived of this sensory information which blocks the
visual imagery cognitions that are normally stored and referred by the human
brain. The absence of visual information in the brain has proved to make a huge
difference in the memory and cognitive processes, more prominently, after the
age of 60. Other visual associations such as visuo-spatial coordination,
visuo-motor coordination, visuo-auditory, visuo-tactile and visuo-olfactory
could contribute to loss of major information, which is stored by the complex coordination between temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital
lobe. The cumulative information processing within these major parts of the human brain is
stored in short-term and long-term memory and is retrieved frequently by
working memory as and when required. 

The UMACE-VIP tool has been primarily
developed to assess other important cognitive domains in the visually impaired
population such as audio-tactile-spatial-motor coordination.

How will this innovation make a
difference?
Currently, there are no specific diagnostic
tools available to detect memory and cognitive impairment among people who are
visually impaired; It is of utmost importance to prioritize this as the aging
blind population is gradually increasing on a global scale. Statistically, 82%
of people living with blindness are aged 50 and above, (Visual impairment and
blindness Fact Sheet, WHO, N°282, 2014)
Utilization of funds
The researcher is seeking funds to support
a sample study in India, concerning the development and assessment of the
visually impaired population, completing assessment of two groups of visually
impaired population- one which has lost vision since birth and the other
population which has lost vision after birth due to some reason. 
These funds will be used to create the
diagnostic tool, develop a cognitive rehabilitation kit for the visually
impaired and conduct a free clinical assessment of 50 visually impaired
individuals for memory and cognitive impairments as well as assist in the
publication of the research findings and for raising awareness.
I appreciate your contribution towards
my mission of improving the quality of life globally, one individual at a time.

<br/><h4><b><i>FAQ's</i></b></h4>
<p><b>How long will the battery last?</b></p>
<p>We are developing our very own propriety power source. Battery level is dependent on usage and the rate at which you want to track the device. User defined ping rates can be adjusted from every second, through to once per day so Retrievor may never need a recharge for up to 12 months!</p>
<p><b>Will I have to sign up for a carrier subscription?</b></p>
<p>We are using AT&amp;T for data so that Retrievor will function almost anywhere in the world using both GSM networks and autonomous GPS for tracking.  There is a subscription charge of $5.29 per month per device to cover network data charges</p>
<p><b>Will there be additional costs?</b></p>
<p>There will be  a small monthly fee of $5.29 per month per device. In effect, we are guaranteeing the subscription price at $5.29 per device for the 1st year for all of our Indiegogo pre-order customers.</p>

</div></div>","Main PCB Prototype V.3.0 (RET-100)Check out the demo's in the GalleryOur StoryAll products normally start out as an idea, and our little Retrievor was no different. The question ""Can it be done?"" lingered for a few months until other questions were answered. Along the way, we've had engineers tell us:""it's impossible, you can't make it round. It has to be square or rectangular"". ""you can't possibly make it that size as we'd struggle to fit the components in something twice that size""Well, we ignored all of this and went ahead anyway!We're Featured In The Press
From Humble Beginnings!

Then on to our Retrievor RET-100Although this was definitely the best looking device throughout the development process, we encountered many issues which meant we had to completely re-design 4 different  prototypes from the PCB design upwards. 
We tried and tested several available solar cells and panels too but performance was not up to scratch so we decided to move forward with our own proprietary power source development, which brings us to..................
Our Retrievor RT-101
Our Retrievor is slightly larger than as a US Quarter in diameter and not much thicker than a few stacked together. Retrievor brings you all of the functionality a true end to end GPS solution should offer!


                                                        
What's Inside Retrievor?
Having selected and partnered with the very best designers and manufacturers of micro and nano technology, we are able to make Retrievor really tiny. Measuring only 35 mm (1.37"") in diameter and 16 mm (0.63"") thick means you can use Retrievor to track almost anything. 
Powered by record breaking technology which allows us to keep things really, really, small, our GPS unit is one of the industry's smallest, fully integrated module with an on-board antenna. 


                                                                    
Measuring only 10 x 10 x 3.8mm and weighing 1.6 gr., the Nano
Hornet is the world’s smallest fully integrated GPS module with
integrated antenna. Despite its small size and weight, the Micro
Hornet integrates a patch antenna element, LNA, SAW filter,
TCXO, RTC crystal, RF shield and Power Management Unit with
SiRFStarIV™ GPS processor. 

Innovative GPS firmware can detect changes in context, temperature, and satellite signals to achieve a state of near continuous navigation availability by maintaining and opportunistically updating its internal parameters while consuming mere microwatts of battery power.

More GPS Features
Low profile antenna element, 
C/A code SBAS (WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS) and QZSS support 48 channels 
Ultra-high Sensitivity down to 
TTFF of < 1s in 50% of trials under Hot Start conditions
Low Power Consumption of ≤ 15mW 
High Accuracy of <2.5m in 50% of trials 
Self-managed low power modes
ARM7® microprocessor 
Ultra-low weight of 1.6g 
FCC, CE, VCCI certified RoHS II/REACH compliant

Our Retrievor Tracking PlatformWe are using a customized version of OpenGTS for our tracking platform.  Access is available on most modern devices - Smartphones, Tablets, iPads etc.



Check out the demo HERE
Free Android, iPhone and Web Apps
Track your very own Retrievor any way you wish, using our feature rich applications. These allow you to set up a Geo-Zone which triggers either a text, email or ringtone once your Retrievor moves out of the zone. You can pinpoint Retrievor's exact location by zooming in, you can also check speed, distance traveled and route taken. Retrievor is accurate to <2.5 meters so finding your lost items or loved ones is a breeze!
GEO- Fencing
Track your Retrievor live online and follow its every move, set up Geo-Fence parameters which trigger an e-mail, ringtone or SMS when the device leaves or enters the designated area. Geo-fences can be selected as shapes (circle, square, rectangle) or manually by dragging the fence area to suit your specific needs.
Ease Of Use Is Always In Mind
You can chose your own icon from a standard menu for each RETRIEVOR device you want to track or even upload your very own. By clicking on the icon you are automatically taken to the ""Map"" screen, displaying the exact location of Retrievor, route taken, speed, and distance traveled. With all this information, there's little chance anything will be missing in action for too long!
Multi-Retrievor Support!
Want to keep track of your daughter and son's cars or two family pets at the same time? No problem! Upon activation, you can track and retrieve several devices on one mapping screen.
Multi-Purpose Attachment Clip
Your free little attachment clip allows you to attach your Retrievor to just about anything, including pet collars. 

Activation and Subscription Fees
There is a $5.29 monthly subscription fee for your first Retrievor.  Additional Retrievors can be added to your subscription plan for only $4.59 extra per month. Some good news though - As a token of our appreciation, there is NO Activation Fee for Indiegogo contributors!
GSM Coverage
Retrievor will function almost anywhere in the world using GSM networks and autonomous GPS for tracking. We have incorporated (A)ssisted GPS to improve spatial resolution (accuracy) through cell triangulation.





What We Need & What You Get


In a nutshell, we've done all of the prep work and now need your help through pre-orders to acquire the funding to go to full manufacturing to put Retrievor into large scale production.  
With your help, we need to: .

Place our very first full production orders
We also need funding to further our App development and back-end technology
Futher develop our proprietary power source (in parallel with the above).



Project Timeline




Risks and challenges
As with any product, supply chain logistics can potentially impact parts delivery. Additionally, delays may result from final detailing and testing lab procedures and certifications.
The Road Ahead
At this point in our venture we have already selected technology and manufacturing partners and the hardware design is secured.

FAQ's
How long will the battery last?
We are developing our very own propriety power source. Battery level is dependent on usage and the rate at which you want to track the device. User defined ping rates can be adjusted from every second, through to once per day so Retrievor may never need a recharge for up to 12 months!
Will I have to sign up for a carrier subscription?
We are using AT&T for data so that Retrievor will function almost anywhere in the world using both GSM networks and autonomous GPS for tracking.  There is a subscription charge of $5.29 per month per device to cover network data charges
Will there be additional costs?
There will be  a small monthly fee of $5.29 per month per device. In effect, we are guaranteeing the subscription price at $5.29 per device for the 1st year for all of our Indiegogo pre-order customers.
How accurate is Retrievor?
Accurate within <2.5 meters in 50% of trials
Do you ship internationally?
Yes, besides USA we will ship Worldwide.
What languages will the App be available in?
Multi-language support
Can I travel with Retrievor?
Yes, without additional cost or any changes, Retrievor can be used all over the world!
How can Retrievor be so small?
With the help of smart technology and the inclusion of a propriety charging solution, Retrievor can efficiently manage the battery consumption, which means that we can use a very small power source. Retrievor is also packed with the latest components that are all very small in size..
How do I connect with Retrievor through my SmartPhone?
In the box there will be a device code for the App and our hosted web mapping service. After downloading the App from AppStore or Google Play you enter the device code and right away you are connected and can start tracking Retrievor.
Will it be possible to remote control the polling frequency ?
Yes.The polling frequency can be adjusted remotely by the user by logging into our server based application platform or through the use of our Apps. Polling can be set at anything from every second through to once per week or the device can be set in 'sleep' state for extended periods.
What are GPS and Glonass?
GPS is a satellite system created by the US military but is today mostly used for civilian purposes. Glonass is the Russian version that has better reach in many locations. To be able to offer both will give superior coverage.
How can I attach Retrievor to my child or pet?
In the box you will find a multipurpose clip that makes it possible to attach Retrievor anywhere and there will also be a specially designed collar clip for pet collars.
Can I become a distributor/dealer/reseller/retailer or partner?
At the moment we are focusing our efforts on our first manufacturing run and QA but do have small retailer/reseller bundles available here on our campaign page. Please contact us through this link http://www.retrievor.com/contact-us showing your interest and we will contact you once our first manufacturing run is complete and dispatched.
How do I charge my Retrievor?
 A micro USB cable is included in the box. Attach it to Retrievor and then you can charge it via your computer or by using the adapter that came with your SmartPhone. You can also use any standard USB A cigarette lighter adapter to charge Retrievor if needed (using the USB A - MIcro B cable which is included with your device) These chargers are freely available in most stores.

a grass roots level.<span>  The founders of the
business are a mixture of local and international personalities who have a wealth of experience from food and beverage industry, as well as international trade.<br/></span></p>
<p>The founders

<p>The nature
in this region is always referred to as “God’s Garden”, simply because of the quality

events such as HM Queen Elizabeth II carnation in 1953 (Ilocki Winery) and are regularly receiving Gold and Silver medals at World class wine events.</span></p>
<p>Our interest is to allow the

ensuring that the locals are truly the benefactors of their hard work and
passion, they can contribute to delivering a world class product from the

know died from lung cancer – and they’re non-smokers.  Nobody in his or her house even smoked.  But one thing is clear: they were constantly exposed to air pollution when they commuted to and from work everyday.  One of them also happened to work in a really old building, which increased her risks for indoor air pollution. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy""

your air pollution-related health risks?  There are many ways.  One of them is a very simple: move out of the city.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481726738/d45beyx5hfet3nyjatjt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>When you live in the city, breathing polluted air is unavoidable.  Merely stepping outside exposes you to smoke emitted by vehicles on the road, second-hand smoke from other people’s cigarettes, and dust, among others.</p><p style=""text-align:

countryside – where farm tractors outnumber cars, in the woods where trees outnumber buildings or houses, or at the beach where any semblance of air pollution is either drowned out by fresh air from the sea or pollution is swept away to the open water – quality air is abundant.</p><p>But moving out of the city – especially if you and your family’s already well established in your city – can be very impractical and life-disrupting.  You may have to do so many things and basically start your lives all over again.  And for most people, that’s too high a price to pay for fresh, clean air – at least while they’re still not sick from air pollution.  For you and your family, that may be the case too. </p><p>Another option is to stay indoors most of the time.  That’s sounds like a very simple and great idea but it’s not necessarily so because air pollution isn’t just present outdoors – it’s also present indoors.  Some of the most common indoor air pollutants include carbon monoxide, radon, nitrogen dioxide, second-hand smoke, lead particles from old house paint, asbestos, and molds.  The effects of these indoor air pollutants on your body may range from as simple as allergies to more serious health problems, especially if you have pre-existing breathing-related health conditions such as asthma.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy""

people who are aware of the need to manage the quality of the air they breathe is using ordinary and affordable breathing masks.  These masks are usually made from cloth or other composite materials.  But ordinary breathing masks aren’t enough to ensure that you breathe in enough fresh clean air.  Why?</p><p>First, the materials from which these ordinary breathing masks are made aren’t fine enough to screen out enough of the smallest particles or pollutants floating in the air.  The best among these ordinary breathing masks can only filter up to 67% of air pollutants from the air you breathe.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481727053/uuldjswqkif60op1zwjd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Another reason why ordinary breathing masks aren’t enough to give fresh clean air is quantity.  Such masks either filter up to 67% of air pollutants or provide enough air. You see, the higher the filtering ability of ordinary breathing masks, the less air you can breathe in.  If you want to breathe in more air, the ability to filter pollutants becomes less.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481727088/efth8v1k8e1dmrpky3af.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Lastly, ordinary breathing masks aren’t enough because they can contaminate the air you breathe with recycled air – the carbon dioxide you breathe out.  Ordinary breathing masks – particularly those at the top of the air filtering chain – are very limited in terms of letting you release the carbon dioxide you breathe out, which allows it to contaminate the already limited fresh air you’re able to breathe in.  That is why most people who use such masks tend to remove them frequently just to be able to really “breathe”.</p><p>If moving out of the city is out of the question and staying indoors and wearing ordinary breathing masks just don’t cut it, is there anything else you can do to minimize your air pollution-related health risks?  The good news is yes, there is – with <strong>Breathe Clean!</strong></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><u> </u></b></p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

You see, the higher the filtering ability of ordinary breathing masks, the less air you can breathe in.  If you want to breathe in more air, the ability to filter pollutants becomes less.Lastly, ordinary breathing masks aren’t enough because they can contaminate the air you breathe with recycled air – the carbon dioxide you breathe out.  Ordinary breathing masks – particularly those at the top of the air filtering chain – are very limited in terms of letting you release the carbon dioxide you breathe out, which allows it to contaminate the already limited fresh air you’re able to breathe in.  That is why most people who use such masks tend to remove them frequently just to be able to really “breathe”.If moving out of the city is out of the question and staying indoors and wearing ordinary breathing masks just don’t cut it, is there anything else you can do to minimize your air pollution-related health risks?  The good news is yes, there is – with Breathe Clean!  


The Breathe Clean urban breathing mask comes in 2 models: The Breathe Clean SOLO and the Breathe Clean PLUS.Breathe Clean SOLO is a stand alone model, which comes in 5 available colors: black, white, blue, pink, and green.Check out Breathe Clean Solo's key features in this short video:Breathe-Clean SOLO is ideal for people who want to use the breathing mask for brisk walking, running, biking, or other activities where freedom or ease of movement is preferred.The SOLO's motorized fan can operate for up to 6 straight hours on a full, single charge. The unit can be charged via your computer's USB port via a mini USB charging cable that comes with the unit.Check out Breathe Clean Plus' key features in this short video:The Breathe Clean PLUS can give you more air compared to the SOLO for up to 8 hours on a full charge.  It features a separate, rechargeable motorized air filtration unit that uses an air tube to deliver fresh, clean air to the breathing mask.Breathe Clean Plus' breathing masks come in 2 sizes - adult and child.  They also come in 2 colors - blue and gray.The filtration unit can be charged through an electrical outlet or your computer’s USB port using a multi-socket charging cable that comes together with the unit.The Breathe Clean PLUS unit can also function as a portable air purifier for small, enclosed spaces such as your car or a small room.  Because it features a significantly more powerful motorized fan and a larger filtration unit, you can filter and disperse enough fresh, clean air that you can share with others in small, enclosed spaces.  All you have to do is detach the air tube from the filtration unit, turn it on, and leave it be.  It’s that easy!If you don’t have a bag where you can put the unit in, no problem.  You don’t have to hold it all the time because you can just hook it to one of your pants’ belt loops for a hands-free experience.Included with the air filtration unit is a USB charging cable, an electrical outlet charging adaptor, a breathing mask, an air tube, and a user's manual.Breathe Clean PLUS comes in 5 available colors:  White, Black, Green, Orange, and Pink.  Breathe Clean is not your ordinary urban breathing mask.  It has an internal vacuum micro motor fan that filters the external air  and converts them to a more clean and fresh air:First, Breathe Clean breathing masks feature a 3-process air-filtration system that can filter up to 99.99% of pollutants in the air you breathe.  That ensures you breathe in fresh, clean air only. Process #1:     Involves screening off bacteria from the air using an anti-bacterial filter.Process #2:    Involves screening off dangerous pollutants like formaldehyde, benzene, sulfides, and smoke using an active carbon filter.Process #3:   Involves screening off the smallest, remaining air pollutants using an Electrostatic HEPA filter. Together, these 3 processes allow Breathe Clean breathing masks to give you fresh, clean air on demand.The second way Breathe Clean breathing masks help you enjoy the same fresh, clean air that’s available in nature is through an anion layer that’s found in each of the 3 air filters. They naturally give off the optimal amounts of negative ions in the air you breathe whenever you use Breathe Clean breathing masks.If you ever wondered why you feel good and clear-minded when you’re in the beach, in the woods, or when it’s raining hard, it’s because of the abundant amounts of negative ions in the air.  Breathe Clean helps you enjoy invigoratingly healthy air on demand.  The Final way Breathe Clean masks helps you enjoy fresh, clean air is via an excellent air circulation system with 2 key features:  a motorized fan and pressure-reducing valves that release circulated air & heat from the mask.  Breathe Clean breathing masks ensure you get enough fresh, clean air using a rechargeable motorized fan, which draws in enough air for filtering.  The fan ensures that you will be able to breathe generous amounts of fresh, clean air anytime and anywhere.  Breathe Clean breathing masks help keep the fresh, clean air you breathe inside the masks stay that way by allowing you to efficiently release the carbon dioxide you breathe out – and keep it out.  Fresh, clean air in – stuffy, recycled air out.  Working together, the motorized fan and a pressure-reducing exhaust valves help provide you the fresh, clean air you need for hours on end.  You don’t have to take off your mask and expose yourself to air pollution just to release recycled air, as you’ll need to do when using ordinary breathing masks. With Breathe Clean breathing masks, you can enjoy fresh clean air, anytime and anywhere just like them!  Watch this video to hear what they have to say about getting fresh, clean air from Breathe Clean breathing masks.

It has invaded areas of Canada, the northern United States and parts of northeastern Europe. Its invasion fronts aided by translocations via bait trade, agriculture, horticulture, and unintentional transport have introduced this species throughout Canada and northern hardwood forests of the United States. L. terrestris alters ecosystems by rapidly consuming leaf litter, thereby altering nutrient cycling and availability, affects seedling establishment and plant communities through its interaction with seeds. It may also displace native earthworm species<br/><p><b>        Description</b><br/></p><ul><p><i>Lumbricus terrestris </i><span>is a relatively large, anecic earthworm. It is pinkish to reddish-brown in colour and typically reaches 10-25 cm in length.</span></p></ul><ul>
<p><b>Occurs in:</b></p>
<p><span>agricultural areas, natural forests, planted forests, range/grasslands, riparian zones, ruderal/disturbed, scrub/shrublands, urban areas, wetlands</span></p>
</ul><ul>
<p><b>Habitat description</b></p>
<p><i>Lumbricus terrestris </i><span>can inhabit all soil types except coarse sands, bare rock and acidic peat (<i>Sphagnum</i>). It has been found to be constrained by the -15 °C isotherm. It tolerate soils with pH values as low as 3.5–3.7 and as high as about 8.<i>L. terrestris</i>is not frost-tolerant indicating that it hibernates in deep soil layers during the winter (Addison, 2009; Tiunov <i>et al</i>., 2006; Wironen &amp; Moore, 2006). Although often present in agricultural fields, it fares poorly due to herbicides, mechanical damage and lack of leaf litter (L. Frelich, pers. comm.).</span></p>
</ul><ul>
<p><b>General impacts</b></p>
<p><span>In many ecosystems and in agricultural systems earthworms are highly beneficial to soil processes (Hendrix &amp; Bohlen, 2002). However in forest ecosystems with few or no native earthworms, introduced species can have negative effects. Earthworms are keystone detritivores that can act as “ecosystem engineers” and have the potential to change fundamental soil properties, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity (Frelich <i>et al</i>., 2006; Eisenhauer<i>et al</i>., 2007; Addison, 2009)</span></p>
<p>Exotic earthworms are a particular problem in previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by <i>Acer</i>, <i>Quercus</i>, <i>Betula</i>, <i>Pinus</i> and <i>Populus</i> (Frelich <i>et al</i>., 2006).</p>
<p>Earthworms are often classified based on their activity and feeding type, which affects their impacts on the soil (Bouché, 1977 in Addison, 2009). <a href=""http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=1710&amp;fr=1&amp;sts=sss&amp;lang=EN"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Dendrobaena octaedra</i></a> and <a href=""http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=1697&amp;fr=1&amp;sts=sss&amp;lang=EN"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Dendrodrilus rubidus</i></a> are epigeic species, which inhabit and feed at the soil surface. Epigeics physically disrupt the organic layer of the soil by consuming and mixing the F and H layers, producing a homogenous and granular form of organic forest floor (Addison, 2009). <a href=""http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=1711&amp;fr=1&amp;sts=sss&amp;lang=EN"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Lumbricus rubellus</i></a> operates in two categories, 1) epigeic which inhabit and feed at the soil surface and 2) endogeic which live and feed in the mineral horizons below the organic (LFH) layer. Thus it is considered epi-endogeic in its habits, feeding on organic matter in the forest floor, but also mixing the organic material into the upper layer of mineral soil (Addison, 2009). <i>L. terrestris</i> is a deep-burrowing anecic earthworm, which create permanent vertical burrows in the mineral layer. They come to the surface to feed on litter and pull it down to their burrows, depositing casts of mixed organic and mineral material on the soil surface (Addison, 2009).</p>
<p>Thus earthworms in different functional groups have different impacts on the soil (Frelich <i>et al</i>., 2006; Hale <i>et al</i>., 2008). Often multiple earthworm species inhabit areas of forest, and studies suggest that impacts are greater when earthworms from more than one functional group occur together (Hale <i>et al</i>., 2008). Earthworm invasions typically occur in waves (e.g. Hendrix &amp; Bohlen, 2002; Eisenhauer <i>et al</i>., 2007), with epigeic (e.g. <i>D. octaedra</i>, <i>D. rubidus</i>) or epi-endogeic (e.g. <i>L. rubellus</i>) species arriving first as they are able to utilise undisturbed forest floors. The first noticeable impacts tend to be physical disruption of the stratified humus layers on the forest floor. Endogeics generally only invade after the organic layer has been modified by epigeic or epi-endogeic species. Anecic species (e.g. <i>L. terrestris</i>) are usually last to arrive (James &amp; Hendrix, 2004 in Addison, 2009).</p>
<p>The purported impacts of invasive earthworms are often varied between publications, and different soil types and soil layers may be affected differently by earthworm invasion. However the main effect of earthworms is to consume litter, and incorporate it into deeper soil layers, thus causing mixing of the A and O soil horizons. This causes extreme reduction of the litter layer and changes in nutrient concentrations and cycling in the soil. Other soil characteristics such as pH, porosity and decomposition rates may also be affected. Physical disruption of plant roots and mycorrhizal associations is also a common impact. These changes to fundamental soil properties have cascading effects on plant communities, microorganisms, micro and mesofauna, birds and mammals (Hale <i>et al</i>., 2008; Addison, 2009).</p>

<p><b>Uses</b></p>
<p><i>Lumbricus terrestris </i><span>is an extremely common bait species, and was found to be the most common species sold in bait stores in a survey conducted in the Upper Midwest United States where<i>L. terrestris </i>is invasive (Keller<i>et al</i>, 2007)</span></p>
<i></i><p><i>L. terrestris</i>is an anecic earthworm that removes litter from the soil surface, pulling it down into the mineral layer, and deposit casts of mixed organic and mineral material on the soil surface. It is important in nutrient cycling and soil aeration in agriculture (Addison, 2009).</p>
</ul><ul>
<p><b>Geographical range</b></p>
<p><u>Native range</u><span>:<i>Lumbircus terrestris </i>is native to Europe where it is one of the most common earthworms and has an expansive native range. However, its specific native and non-native range remains largely uncertain.</span></p>
<u></u><p><u>Known introduced range</u>: <i>L. terrestris </i>has invaded new locations of Europe such as Romaina, spread through large expanses of the Russian Federation, and invaded areas of Canada and northern United States that were previously glaciated and contained no native earthworms.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p><b>Introduction pathways to new locations</b></p>
<p><i>Agriculture: </i><span>Can be present in potted or ball and burlap nursery stock, and sod.</span></p>
<i></i><p><i>Other: </i><i>Lumbricus terrestris </i>is an extremely commonly used fish bait. Its use and abandonment as such constitutes a major method of its dispersal (Cameron <i>et al</i>, 2007).</p>

</ul><ul>
<p><b>Management information</b></p>
<p><span>There are currently no effective methods to eradicate established earthworm populations without unacceptable non-target effects. Thus the main technique for managing invasions is prevention of introductions, via various pathways (Cameron<i>et al</i>., 2007; Keller<i>et al</i>., 2007).</span></p>
<p><u>Preventative measures</u>: One of the major pathways for earthworm introductions is believed to from release by anglers discarding unwanted live bait. Keller <i>et al</i>. (2007) suggest two alternatives to reduce the likelihood of further establishments while preserving the economically important live trade of earthworms. These are: 1) Replace the species currently sold with earthworm species that are unlikely to establish populations, e.g.<i>Eudrilus eugeniae</i> which has an extremely low invasion risk in the U.S. Midwest, and 2) Strengthen efforts to educate anglers to dispose of live earthworms responsibly, i.e. in the trash where landfill conditions are likely to kill them (Keller <i>et al</i>., 2007) or to prohibit the abandonment of live bait (Cameron <i>et al</i>., 2007).</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Management and regulatory strategies should also take into account the fact that some earthworm species, such as </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Lumbricus rubellus</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> have larger impacts than others. This species is less widely distributed than other exotic species. Thus preventing its introduction to new areas is important, even if those areas are already infested with other species (Hale </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">et al</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">., 2006). Similarly, some forests will be more susceptible to invasion than others. Litter calcium content is likely to be an important predictor of litter decomposition rates by exotic earthworms (Holdsworth, 2008).</span><br/></p>
<p>Callaham <i>et al</i>. (2006) suggest various policy measures that could be adapted to prevent the spread of exotic earthworms. The authors suggest restrictions on transportation of soils from infested areas to non-infested areas, unless a special permit certifying that the material is free from earthworm propagules has been granted. Formalized earthworm introduction decision making tools are also recommended as an alternative to the <i>ad hoc</i>decisions made by regulating agencies at present. This decision-making process allows for the quarantine of materials containing propagules of earthworms that have not been identified or widely introduced previously. These quarantines would provide time to determine the ecological risk posed by the introduction of a given earthworm species into particular systems. Suggested types of information needed to determine ecological risk include mode of reproduction, number of embryos per cocoon, ecological “strategy”, and temperature, pH and moisture requirements (Callaham <i>et al</i>., 2006).</p>
<p><u>Cultural measures</u>: Successful establishment of earthworm populations is influenced by management of the site. For example, synergistic effects of the invasive weed buckthorn and exotic earthworms could be minimized by early control measures to limit the weed (Heneghan <i>et al</i>, 2006).</p>
<p><u>Chemical control</u>: Where non-native earthworms are not well established or are found in discrete populations, the use of chemical treatments to eradicate undesirable worms may be successful. Chemical control have been used in the management of golf courses. While these treatments are highly effective, the non-target effects of chemicals should be examined before large-scale utilization (Callaham <i>et al</i>., 2006)</p>

Median total production of viable cocoons was 5 per individual, with a range of 0-21. Sperm may be stored for as long as 8 months (Butt &amp; Nuutinen, 1998).</span></p>

The magnitude 8.9 Japan earthquake and resulting tsunami in March 2011 was responsible for more than 28,000 deaths; in comparison, the smaller magnitude 7.0 earthquake occurring in Haiti in January 2010 resulted in an estimated 222,500 fatalities. In recent history, the Pacific Rim is the most affected by seismic activity, with 81% of the world’s largest earthquakes occurring in this region (Doocy et al. 2013)Earthquakes result from sudden energy releases in the earth’s crust, which create seismic waves that result in ground shaking. Earthquakes are usually caused by slippage on a fault due to built up friction between tectonic plates but can also be caused by volcanic eruptions or manmade explosions. Millions of earthquakes occur each year, though only a small proportion is strong enough to be felt and even fewer cause damage. Earthquakes occur at focal depths of 700 km to just under the earth’s surface, and the strength of shaking diminishes with increasing distance from the earthquake’s source. Population growth and increasing urbanization in earthquake-prone areas suggest that earthquake impacts on human populations will increase in the coming decades. Recent large earthquakes affecting large populations in Japan, Haiti, Chile and New Zealand are evidence of this trend and also illustrate significant variations in outcomes such damage and mortality levels.Global impactBetween 1960 and 2006, the ten most lethal earthquakes caused 80% of the 1 million earthquake deaths and occurred in low- and middle-income countries. The main cause of death was building collapse; unreinforced masonry buildings were associated with higher death tolls. Efforts to control and reduce earthquake mortality have made progress in wealthier earthquake prone countries but little or no progress in low- and middle-income countries. Recent experience of a strong earthquake and availability of resources for mitigation were the two strongest determinants of action for risk mitigation. Growing urbanization and populations in developing countries have increased the risk of human impacts (Spence, 2007).According to Chan et al. (2010) China has had the greatest human impact from earthquakes of any country in the past century.The aforementioned data suggest the importance of being able to anticipate these phenomena.This is the main reason why it was thought the project Lumbricus.  Which is .... save as many human lives through the anticipation of the occurrence of an earthquake.How can we achievePreparedness for earthquake at individual, community and organizational levels could be more effective tools in mitigating (the growing incidence) of disaster risk and ameliorating their impacts. That is, to play more significant roles in disaster risk reduction. Preparedness efforts focus on changing animals behaviors in ways that reduce people’s risk and increase their ability to cope with hazard consequences.According to Hill (2009) animals use substrate-borne vibrations to signal in the same contexts that they use vision, hearing, touch, taste, or smell. Study of vibrational communication across animal taxa provides more than just a more complete story. Communication through substrate-borne vibration has its own constraints and opportunities not found in other signaling modalities.The study Mitra et al. (2009) demonstrate that the earthworms respond to the seismic vibrations generated by the worm grunting technique. Worms emerge from their burrows within a few minutes following the onset of vibrations, and the number of worms surfacing is positively correlated with the signal strength.Previous studies were the basis for assessing the idea that through earthworms could build a device for early detection of earthquakes.In a first phase, the state of the art on the subject is made.

In a second phase, it is expected to gather the necessary funds for the construction of a device.Scope of Lumbricus ProjectThe project will have a global impact. After the construction of the device test trials were held in major seismic zones of the planet.What it is needed for crowdfunding?The tests allow the necessary adjustments to the device (prototype), and then build the final version. This will be distributed for free in the major seismic zones of developing countries (Chile, Peru and some Asian countries).For this, we need materials, international logistics because their delivery is free of charge.Prototype DesignMaterials:1.Rectangular glass or plastic container2.Cylindrical metal bar3.Substrate (Earth)4.Earthworms (specific territory where the tests would be conducted)Prototype It is a device built based on the scientific knowledge we have of earthworms and the theory of resonance. These aspects are able to anticipate the occurrence of earthquakes, so can save lives. The prototype will be tested in major seismic zones in the world (Chile, Peru and China) and continuously adjusted as trials conducted in areas of high risk of earthquakes.It is expected by the end of 2016 and have a proven prototype delivered the most vulnerable populations of these countries. The prototypes will be distributed free.  We know of the earthwormTaxonomic name: Lumbricus terrestris  L.Common names: dilly worm (English), green crawler (English), large crawler (English), night crawler (English), nitro crawler (English)Organism type: annelidLumbricus terrestris is a common earthworm, or nightcrawler, which is native to Europe and has recently received attention for its invasion of North America. It has invaded areas of Canada, the northern United States and parts of northeastern Europe. Its invasion fronts aided by translocations via bait trade, agriculture, horticulture, and unintentional transport have introduced this species throughout Canada and northern hardwood forests of the United States. L. terrestris alters ecosystems by rapidly consuming leaf litter, thereby altering nutrient cycling and availability, affects seedling establishment and plant communities through its interaction with seeds. It may also displace native earthworm species        DescriptionLumbricus terrestris is a relatively large, anecic earthworm. It is pinkish to reddish-brown in colour and typically reaches 10-25 cm in length.
Occurs in:
agricultural areas, natural forests, planted forests, range/grasslands, riparian zones, ruderal/disturbed, scrub/shrublands, urban areas, wetlands

Habitat description
Lumbricus terrestris can inhabit all soil types except coarse sands, bare rock and acidic peat (Sphagnum). It has been found to be constrained by the -15 °C isotherm. It tolerate soils with pH values as low as 3.5–3.7 and as high as about 8.L. terrestrisis not frost-tolerant indicating that it hibernates in deep soil layers during the winter (Addison, 2009; Tiunov et al., 2006; Wironen & Moore, 2006). Although often present in agricultural fields, it fares poorly due to herbicides, mechanical damage and lack of leaf litter (L. Frelich, pers. comm.).

General impacts
In many ecosystems and in agricultural systems earthworms are highly beneficial to soil processes (Hendrix & Bohlen, 2002). However in forest ecosystems with few or no native earthworms, introduced species can have negative effects. Earthworms are keystone detritivores that can act as “ecosystem engineers” and have the potential to change fundamental soil properties, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity (Frelich et al., 2006; Eisenhaueret al., 2007; Addison, 2009)
Exotic earthworms are a particular problem in previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by Acer, Quercus, Betula, Pinus and Populus (Frelich et al., 2006).
Earthworms are often classified based on their activity and feeding type, which affects their impacts on the soil (Bouché, 1977 in Addison, 2009). Dendrobaena octaedra and Dendrodrilus rubidus are epigeic species, which inhabit and feed at the soil surface. Epigeics physically disrupt the organic layer of the soil by consuming and mixing the F and H layers, producing a homogenous and granular form of organic forest floor (Addison, 2009). Lumbricus rubellus operates in two categories, 1) epigeic which inhabit and feed at the soil surface and 2) endogeic which live and feed in the mineral horizons below the organic (LFH) layer. Thus it is considered epi-endogeic in its habits, feeding on organic matter in the forest floor, but also mixing the organic material into the upper layer of mineral soil (Addison, 2009). L. terrestris is a deep-burrowing anecic earthworm, which create permanent vertical burrows in the mineral layer. They come to the surface to feed on litter and pull it down to their burrows, depositing casts of mixed organic and mineral material on the soil surface (Addison, 2009).
Thus earthworms in different functional groups have different impacts on the soil (Frelich et al., 2006; Hale et al., 2008). Often multiple earthworm species inhabit areas of forest, and studies suggest that impacts are greater when earthworms from more than one functional group occur together (Hale et al., 2008). Earthworm invasions typically occur in waves (e.g. Hendrix & Bohlen, 2002; Eisenhauer et al., 2007), with epigeic (e.g. D. octaedra, D. rubidus) or epi-endogeic (e.g. L. rubellus) species arriving first as they are able to utilise undisturbed forest floors. The first noticeable impacts tend to be physical disruption of the stratified humus layers on the forest floor. Endogeics generally only invade after the organic layer has been modified by epigeic or epi-endogeic species. Anecic species (e.g. L. terrestris) are usually last to arrive (James & Hendrix, 2004 in Addison, 2009).
The purported impacts of invasive earthworms are often varied between publications, and different soil types and soil layers may be affected differently by earthworm invasion. However the main effect of earthworms is to consume litter, and incorporate it into deeper soil layers, thus causing mixing of the A and O soil horizons. This causes extreme reduction of the litter layer and changes in nutrient concentrations and cycling in the soil. Other soil characteristics such as pH, porosity and decomposition rates may also be affected. Physical disruption of plant roots and mycorrhizal associations is also a common impact. These changes to fundamental soil properties have cascading effects on plant communities, microorganisms, micro and mesofauna, birds and mammals (Hale et al., 2008; Addison, 2009).

Uses
Lumbricus terrestris is an extremely common bait species, and was found to be the most common species sold in bait stores in a survey conducted in the Upper Midwest United States whereL. terrestris is invasive (Kelleret al, 2007)
L. terrestrisis an anecic earthworm that removes litter from the soil surface, pulling it down into the mineral layer, and deposit casts of mixed organic and mineral material on the soil surface. It is important in nutrient cycling and soil aeration in agriculture (Addison, 2009).

Geographical range
Native range:Lumbircus terrestris is native to Europe where it is one of the most common earthworms and has an expansive native range. However, its specific native and non-native range remains largely uncertain.
Known introduced range: L. terrestris has invaded new locations of Europe such as Romaina, spread through large expanses of the Russian Federation, and invaded areas of Canada and northern United States that were previously glaciated and contained no native earthworms.

Introduction pathways to new locations
Agriculture: Can be present in potted or ball and burlap nursery stock, and sod.
Other: Lumbricus terrestris is an extremely commonly used fish bait. Its use and abandonment as such constitutes a major method of its dispersal (Cameron et al, 2007).
Other:Lumbricus terrestris may be dispersed by aquatic invertebrates, waterbirds, or vertebrate predators (Cameron et al, 2007).
Road vehicles (long distance):Industrial or recreational activities may transport of soil and plant materials containing cocoons or  Lumbricus terrestris (Cameron et al, 2007).
Local dispersal methods
Consumption/excretion:
Water currents:

Management information
There are currently no effective methods to eradicate established earthworm populations without unacceptable non-target effects. Thus the main technique for managing invasions is prevention of introductions, via various pathways (Cameronet al., 2007; Kelleret al., 2007).
Preventative measures: One of the major pathways for earthworm introductions is believed to from release by anglers discarding unwanted live bait. Keller et al. (2007) suggest two alternatives to reduce the likelihood of further establishments while preserving the economically important live trade of earthworms. These are: 1) Replace the species currently sold with earthworm species that are unlikely to establish populations, e.g.Eudrilus eugeniae which has an extremely low invasion risk in the U.S. Midwest, and 2) Strengthen efforts to educate anglers to dispose of live earthworms responsibly, i.e. in the trash where landfill conditions are likely to kill them (Keller et al., 2007) or to prohibit the abandonment of live bait (Cameron et al., 2007).
Management and regulatory strategies should also take into account the fact that some earthworm species, such as Lumbricus rubellus have larger impacts than others. This species is less widely distributed than other exotic species. Thus preventing its introduction to new areas is important, even if those areas are already infested with other species (Hale et al., 2006). Similarly, some forests will be more susceptible to invasion than others. Litter calcium content is likely to be an important predictor of litter decomposition rates by exotic earthworms (Holdsworth, 2008).
Callaham et al. (2006) suggest various policy measures that could be adapted to prevent the spread of exotic earthworms. The authors suggest restrictions on transportation of soils from infested areas to non-infested areas, unless a special permit certifying that the material is free from earthworm propagules has been granted. Formalized earthworm introduction decision making tools are also recommended as an alternative to the ad hocdecisions made by regulating agencies at present. This decision-making process allows for the quarantine of materials containing propagules of earthworms that have not been identified or widely introduced previously. These quarantines would provide time to determine the ecological risk posed by the introduction of a given earthworm species into particular systems. Suggested types of information needed to determine ecological risk include mode of reproduction, number of embryos per cocoon, ecological “strategy”, and temperature, pH and moisture requirements (Callaham et al., 2006).
Cultural measures: Successful establishment of earthworm populations is influenced by management of the site. For example, synergistic effects of the invasive weed buckthorn and exotic earthworms could be minimized by early control measures to limit the weed (Heneghan et al, 2006).
Chemical control: Where non-native earthworms are not well established or are found in discrete populations, the use of chemical treatments to eradicate undesirable worms may be successful. Chemical control have been used in the management of golf courses. While these treatments are highly effective, the non-target effects of chemicals should be examined before large-scale utilization (Callaham et al., 2006)

Preference is related to high Ca and possibly N concentrations. Thus basswood, ash and aspen are most preferred, followed by sugar maple and maple species. Oak is less palatable due to its low Ca concentration, but will be consumed if no other leaves with higher Ca are present (Frelichet al, 2006; Suarez et al, 2006; Belote & Jones, 2009).
Reproduction
Lumbricus terrestrisis a reciprocally mating simultaneous hermaphrodite, which reproduces sexually with individuals mutually exchanging sperm.L. terrestrisleaves its burrow to copulate on the soil surface. Sperm is stored, and mated individuals produce cocoons for up to 12 months after the mating. A study on the hatchability of cocoons found a range of 76 to 62% hatched over the 5 months following mating, which decreased to about 11% in the sixth month, and cocoons after that failed to hatch. Median total production of viable cocoons was 5 per individual, with a range of 0-21. Sperm may be stored for as long as 8 months (Butt & Nuutinen, 1998).

<h3>Introduction to sellOttO</h3>
<p>SellOttO has been created by a couple, Franco - aeronautical engineer and Eleonora - medical doctor, inspired by their everyday cycling experiences. We have started the sellOttO project around two years ago developing 15 prototypes of saddles, testing them both in the laboratory and on the field (with the support of many <a href=""https://youtu.be/Rd8bVEMdLOY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cyclists</a> on various types of bicycles). Once achieved the best balance between pedalling efficiency and saddle comfort, we have proceeded first in the ergonomic certification (with the experts of <a href=""https://youtu.be/O1VpcheTXkY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sport Medicine Center</a> of Pavia University) and then in the structural certification (with the <a href=""https://youtu.be/ZbIvC112esA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mechanical and Aerospace Departement</a> of Turin University). With the current 1st production lot (produced with local italian expert artisans) we want now to explore the feeling of different types of cyclists around the world. The backers' contribution will be used to manufacture the 1st operative production lot; the contributors' proactive feedbacks will be welcome for the 2nd operative production lot.</p>

<h3>Message from Conn, the bald guy with holes in his head:</h3>
<p><i><strong>I gamified my cancer and survived, now I'm building an app to help others do the same.</strong></i></p>
<p><font>I started from the get go, imagining my cancer was something I could beat. I made them fun and playful and debunked the fear of dying through humor and the creation of visual stimulus that helped me see my cancer as something to work with, move it around, squish it, squash it and bounce it right out of the park. You name it I scribbled it down.</font></p>
<p><font>I turned my whole cancer experience into a game, giving myself simple fun tasks on a daily basis to thwart my cancer with my mind and body. I added physical cancer beating metaphors into my work routines and began tapping into the science of Psychoneuroimmunology - which is how what you think, can affect how your body behaves. It also started to make me stronger. Because I had a job to do! I wasn't helpless, and my immune system responded to this. Our brains are far more connected to our bodies than we've ever believed. What I was thinking, was literally making me stronger, more resilient and enabled me to bounce back better from all the different treatments I underwent. </font></p>
<p><font>When I beat my cancer years later, my doctors, oncologists and a clever professor of science urged me to share my gamified approach to healing with others, to help them do just the same as me, and survive. </font></p>
<p><font>So I did.</font></p>
<p><font>I resigned from my job as Creative Director of a big advertising agency to dedicate my life to empowering other cancer patients with a participatory role in their own healing. Why, because it's entirely free, it's a shift of mindset, an approach, that will give you a better chance of a more positive cancer outcome.</font></p>
<p><font>I know what it's like when facing this thing. Fear can completely disable you, that's why this app is designed to give you purpose in your own healing and to ultimately make you harder to kill. </font></p>
<p>So let's rock! And make it a reality.</p>
<h3>Why does the world need this?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">There are millions of people facing cancer who feel entirely helpless - which can negatively affect their immune systems, making it harder for them to bounce back from the disease - But there are many more supporters like you, who can now do something to change this</span>.</p>
<p>We believe that with some initial guidance and tools, people will not only be able to boost themselves, but thereafter help boost others that are in the same position they were once in.</p>
<h3>Why The Cancer Dojo App?</h3>
<p>It may sound strange, but it really is the best time in human history to be diagnosed with cancer - Because we now know so much more about how our brains and our bodies can work so effectively together, rather than apart - And now, importantly, we have the technology to harness and share this healing potential.</p>
<p>The Cancer Dojo App empowers cancer patients by enabling them with a positive purpose during a time of immense stress. It provides a simple, informed, user-friendly journey to reduce fear, inspire action and harness an increasing range of creative tools, tasks and techniques built to overcome helplessness and boost the human immune system. The app is informed by the science of Psychoneuroimmunolgy - which is how what you think, can affect how your body behaves.</p>
<p>It also connects patients to relevant worldwide support groups and actively empowers friends, loved ones and supporters (like you and I) to play a meaningful supportive role in boosting patients resilience.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">A Complimentary Support Tool</span></h3>
<p>The Cancer Dojo App is a fully complimentary support tool and should be seen as an addition, not an alternative, to any traditional therapies or those advised by your Medical practitioner. </p>
<p>The Cancer Dojo App is part of Cancer Dojo's ongoing movement aimed at boosting people’s well being by building their mental fortitude to boost their immune system.</p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>In 2006, Conn, is an iconic South African internationally awarded creative director, big wave surfer, husband and father of two young children who was diagnosed with a rare form of adult malignant brain cancer.</p>
<p>Using his experience in creative thinking and storytelling, Conn immersed himself in his cancer healing, using ideas and pens, pencils, paint and sticks of chalk. The world became his physical metaphoric cancer-beating playground - An upbeat, visually engaging canvas that helped him augment his treatments, his resilience and immune system, which ultimately helped to  manage and beat his cancer in 2013.</p>
<p>Since then Conn has been urged by doctors, oncologists and professors of science to share his approach of purposeful mindful thinking to assist others facing the disease - Which he did, by resigning from his job in advertising in mid 2015 to launch Cancer Dojo under the banner of his social enterprise Dojolabs CC with South African Non Profit Organization, People Living With Cancer - PLWC. Conn has shared his vision in Europe, Asia and the US as a keynote speaker and consultant on the intersection of Creativity, Technology, Resilience and Health.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","Message from Conn, the bald guy with holes in his head:
I gamified my cancer and survived, now I'm building an app to help others do the same.
I started from the get go, imagining my cancer was something I could beat. I made them fun and playful and debunked the fear of dying through humor and the creation of visual stimulus that helped me see my cancer as something to work with, move it around, squish it, squash it and bounce it right out of the park. You name it I scribbled it down.
I turned my whole cancer experience into a game, giving myself simple fun tasks on a daily basis to thwart my cancer with my mind and body. I added physical cancer beating metaphors into my work routines and began tapping into the science of Psychoneuroimmunology - which is how what you think, can affect how your body behaves. It also started to make me stronger. Because I had a job to do! I wasn't helpless, and my immune system responded to this. Our brains are far more connected to our bodies than we've ever believed. What I was thinking, was literally making me stronger, more resilient and enabled me to bounce back better from all the different treatments I underwent. 
When I beat my cancer years later, my doctors, oncologists and a clever professor of science urged me to share my gamified approach to healing with others, to help them do just the same as me, and survive. 
So I did.
I resigned from my job as Creative Director of a big advertising agency to dedicate my life to empowering other cancer patients with a participatory role in their own healing. Why, because it's entirely free, it's a shift of mindset, an approach, that will give you a better chance of a more positive cancer outcome.
I know what it's like when facing this thing. Fear can completely disable you, that's why this app is designed to give you purpose in your own healing and to ultimately make you harder to kill. 
So let's rock! And make it a reality.
Why does the world need this?
There are millions of people facing cancer who feel entirely helpless - which can negatively affect their immune systems, making it harder for them to bounce back from the disease - But there are many more supporters like you, who can now do something to change this.
We believe that with some initial guidance and tools, people will not only be able to boost themselves, but thereafter help boost others that are in the same position they were once in.
Why The Cancer Dojo App?
It may sound strange, but it really is the best time in human history to be diagnosed with cancer - Because we now know so much more about how our brains and our bodies can work so effectively together, rather than apart - And now, importantly, we have the technology to harness and share this healing potential.
The Cancer Dojo App empowers cancer patients by enabling them with a positive purpose during a time of immense stress. It provides a simple, informed, user-friendly journey to reduce fear, inspire action and harness an increasing range of creative tools, tasks and techniques built to overcome helplessness and boost the human immune system. The app is informed by the science of Psychoneuroimmunolgy - which is how what you think, can affect how your body behaves.
It also connects patients to relevant worldwide support groups and actively empowers friends, loved ones and supporters (like you and I) to play a meaningful supportive role in boosting patients resilience.
A Complimentary Support Tool
The Cancer Dojo App is a fully complimentary support tool and should be seen as an addition, not an alternative, to any traditional therapies or those advised by your Medical practitioner. 
The Cancer Dojo App is part of Cancer Dojo's ongoing movement aimed at boosting people’s well being by building their mental fortitude to boost their immune system.
Who are we?
In 2006, Conn, is an iconic South African internationally awarded creative director, big wave surfer, husband and father of two young children who was diagnosed with a rare form of adult malignant brain cancer.
Using his experience in creative thinking and storytelling, Conn immersed himself in his cancer healing, using ideas and pens, pencils, paint and sticks of chalk. The world became his physical metaphoric cancer-beating playground - An upbeat, visually engaging canvas that helped him augment his treatments, his resilience and immune system, which ultimately helped to  manage and beat his cancer in 2013.
Since then Conn has been urged by doctors, oncologists and professors of science to share his approach of purposeful mindful thinking to assist others facing the disease - Which he did, by resigning from his job in advertising in mid 2015 to launch Cancer Dojo under the banner of his social enterprise Dojolabs CC with South African Non Profit Organization, People Living With Cancer - PLWC. Conn has shared his vision in Europe, Asia and the US as a keynote speaker and consultant on the intersection of Creativity, Technology, Resilience and Health.

<br/>HOW WE WORK</h3><p>The reality of pregnancy differs depending on where you were born. Every day, approximately 830 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth (WHO). Almost all maternal deaths (99%) occur in developing countries. In Kenya, 1 in 47 women die from pregnancy and childbirth-related causes.</p><p>In wealthier countries, most women receive four antenatal care visits and are attended by a midwife or skilled health worker during delivery and after birth.</p><p>Pregnant women in Kenya often live long distances away from a health clinic or educated midwives. As a result, many give birth unattended at home, under unhygienic conditions and without a midwife’s attendance. Many Kenyan women are poor and lack the information on how to have a healthy and safe pregnancy, not knowing who to turn to for help or advice.</p><p><strong>A Preventable Problem</strong></p><p>According to the WHO, 75% of maternal deaths in Kenya are preventable. Skilled care before, during and after childbirth can save the lives of thousands of women and newborn babies.</p><p>With simple, low-cost interventions, such as regular midwife visits and a birth kit, Kenyan women can deliver in safe and more hygienic conditions.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536231207/oqbl63jsbspovmbwvc2n.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE MOMS FOR MOMS® PROJECT</h3><p>This is why we have partnered up with the Kenyan Midwife Association.

<br/>WHO WE ARE </h3><p><strong>Maxie </strong>was influenced by the women in her family to care passionately about female health. Her first endevour was founding Ruby Cup, a hygenic menstrual cup and company that supports  female hygiene in Kenya. This social project has already helped over 36,000 Kenyan girls. Since she became pregnant and gave birth to twin boys, she experienced the importance of midwifery, transitioning her mission to help pregnant women in Kenya have a safe birth.</p><p><strong>Emily</strong> is the creative lead and other half of FEMNA Health. Her interest in women’s health first sparked when she was advised to stop taking the contraceptive pill which she took to control her Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) symptoms. Thanks to that forward-thinking advice, she started to investigate everything about hormones, learning how the female body works and what’s best for it.</p><p><strong>&amp; FEMNA Health's Power-Women </strong>Hannah, Julia, Annie, Gosia, Alessia, Melina<br/>and Loic.   </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TIMELINE</strong></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">

<br/>WIE WIR ARBEITEN</h3><p>Laut der WHO sterben jeden Tag schätzungsweise 830 Frauen an schwangerschafts- und geburtsbezogenen Ursachen, die vermieden werden könnten. Nahezu alle Fälle von Müttersterblichkeit (99%) passieren in Entwicklungsländern. In Kenya stirbt eine von 47 Frauen an Folgen ihrer Schwangerschaft oder der Geburt ihres Kindes.</p><p><strong>Warum?</strong></p><p>In Ländern mit hohem Einkommen sind ungefähr vier pränatale Vorsorgeuntersuchung, die Unterstützung einer Hebamme und gut ausgebildetes Personal während und nach der Geburt die Regel.</p><p>In Kenia leben schwangere Frauen oft sehr weit von der nächsten Klinik und somit von gut ausgebildeten Hebamme entfernt. Resultat sind daher häufig Hausgeburten mit unhygienischen Bedingungen und ohne ärztlicher oder professioneller Unterstützung. Viele Frauen sind arm und nicht ausreichend über relevante Faktoren einer gesunden und sicheren Schwangerschaft informiert. Sie wissen nicht, wer ihnen in ihrer Situation helfen kann.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536231225/tkbrxqbz3hyct7egx2eg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>DAS MOMS FOR MOMS®-PROJEKT</h3><p>75% der Müttersterblichkeit in Kenya sind laut der WHO vermeidbar. Sachkundige Verpflegung vor, während und nach der Geburt kann das Leben vieler Frauen und deren Kinder retten. Eine Entbindung in Sicherheit unter hygienischen Bedingungen ist schon durch kleine, kostengünstige Maßnahmen, wie zum Beispiel regelmäßige Besuche einer Hebamme oder einem Geburt-Kit möglich. Aus diesem Grund haben wir uns mit der <a href=""http://kenyamidwives.org/about-us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kenyan Midwives Association</a> zusammen-geschlossen. Deren Mission ist es, jeder Frau und einem jedem Kind qualitative Pflege durch eine Hebamme zu ermöglichen.</p><p><strong>Für jedes verkaufte Produkt unsere Schwangerschaftslinie spenden wir 10%, um notwendige Materialien für eine sichere Geburt zu kaufen, wie zum Beispiel Bettlaken, Handschuhe &amp; Seife, sowie Informationsmaterial und Sicherheitsrichtlinien für medizinisches Personal.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534360923/qfueqmytkl91bovhsok5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Diese Kits für eine sichere Geburt können das Risiko von Infektionen während und nach der Entbindung erheblich reduzieren und die Schwangerschaft für Frauen in Kenia sicherer machen.</p><p><strong>Bisherige Erfolgserlebnisse der Kenyan Midwife Association:</strong></p><ul>

Durch meine erste Firma, Ruby Cup, die erfolgreich eine innovative Lösung für die Menstruation, eine Menstruatinoskappe,  entwickelt und vertreibt, habe ich mein Interesse an natürlicher Frauenhygiene vertieft. Durch meine Zeit mit Ruby Cup in Kenia, in der ich in den Slums mit lokalen Frauengruppen gearbeitet habe, kenne ich mich mit den Begebenheiten vor Ort gut aus. Als ich Schwanger wurde, habe ich mich mit allen Themen rund um das Thema Geburt, Hebammen und Frauengesundheit beschäftigt. Jetzt möchte ich mich mit FEMNA Health durch unser „Moms For Moms“- Projekt für sichere Geburten in Kenia einsetzen.</p><p><strong>Emily</strong><br/>Mein Interesse an der Gesundheit von Frauen wurde ausgelöst, als mein Arzt mir sagte, ich solle die Pille absetzen, denn ich bekam dadurch chronische Migräne. Ich hatte davor seit Jahren die Pille genommen, um die Symptome des polyzystischen Ovar Syndroms (PCOS) einzudämmen. Dank dieser zukunftsorientierten Beratung begann ich erstmalig zu verstehen, was Hormone sind und wie sie funktionieren. Ich begann meinen Körper zu verstehen und zu lernen, was das Beste für mich und meinen Körper ist.

WOMEN'S HEALTH EXPERTSAll of our products have been developed in collaboration with leading women's health experts. We are grateful to have such a wonderful and highly competent team consisting of a naturopath, food scientist, midwife and pharmacist. This allows us to draw on a great wealth of experience and provide you with a holistic approach to female health and well-being.
HOW WE WORKThe reality of pregnancy differs depending on where you were born. Every day, approximately 830 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth (WHO). Almost all maternal deaths (99%) occur in developing countries. In Kenya, 1 in 47 women die from pregnancy and childbirth-related causes.In wealthier countries, most women receive four antenatal care visits and are attended by a midwife or skilled health worker during delivery and after birth.Pregnant women in Kenya often live long distances away from a health clinic or educated midwives. As a result, many give birth unattended at home, under unhygienic conditions and without a midwife’s attendance. Many Kenyan women are poor and lack the information on how to have a healthy and safe pregnancy, not knowing who to turn to for help or advice.A Preventable ProblemAccording to the WHO, 75% of maternal deaths in Kenya are preventable. Skilled care before, during and after childbirth can save the lives of thousands of women and newborn babies.With simple, low-cost interventions, such as regular midwife visits and a birth kit, Kenyan women can deliver in safe and more hygienic conditions. THE MOMS FOR MOMS® PROJECTThis is why we have partnered up with the Kenyan Midwife Association. Their mission is to provide “every woman and every newborn with quality midwifery care.”For every product of the FEMNA Health pregnancy line that you buy, we give 10% of sales to buy safe birth materials, such as sheets, gloves and soap as well as training materials and guidelines for health workers. Safe birth kits can reduce the risk of infections during and after childbirth and make pregnancy for Kenyan women much safer.Results that the Kenyan Midwife Association achieved so far
Antenatal care uptake increased from 88% to 96%
Skilled birth attendance increased from 44% to 62%
Post-natal care uptake increased from 42 to 51%
Infant mortality rate decreased from 52 to 39 out of 1000 live births
Child mortality rate decreased to more than half of all live births

WHO WE ARE Maxie was influenced by the women in her family to care passionately about female health. Her first endevour was founding Ruby Cup, a hygenic menstrual cup and company that supports  female hygiene in Kenya. This social project has already helped over 36,000 Kenyan girls. Since she became pregnant and gave birth to twin boys, she experienced the importance of midwifery, transitioning her mission to help pregnant women in Kenya have a safe birth.Emily is the creative lead and other half of FEMNA Health. Her interest in women’s health first sparked when she was advised to stop taking the contraceptive pill which she took to control her Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) symptoms. Thanks to that forward-thinking advice, she started to investigate everything about hormones, learning how the female body works and what’s best for it.& FEMNA Health's Power-Women Hannah, Julia, Annie, Gosia, Alessia, Melinaand Loic.   TIMELINE

DIE FEMNA HEALTH SCHWANGERSCHAFTSLINIE Als Maxie, eine der Gründerinnen von FEMNA Health, mit Zwillingen schwanger wurde, erlebte sie viele häufige Schwangerschaftssymptome.

WIE WIR ARBEITENLaut der WHO sterben jeden Tag schätzungsweise 830 Frauen an schwangerschafts- und geburtsbezogenen Ursachen, die vermieden werden könnten. Nahezu alle Fälle von Müttersterblichkeit (99%) passieren in Entwicklungsländern. In Kenya stirbt eine von 47 Frauen an Folgen ihrer Schwangerschaft oder der Geburt ihres Kindes.Warum?In Ländern mit hohem Einkommen sind ungefähr vier pränatale Vorsorgeuntersuchung, die Unterstützung einer Hebamme und gut ausgebildetes Personal während und nach der Geburt die Regel.In Kenia leben schwangere Frauen oft sehr weit von der nächsten Klinik und somit von gut ausgebildeten Hebamme entfernt. Resultat sind daher häufig Hausgeburten mit unhygienischen Bedingungen und ohne ärztlicher oder professioneller Unterstützung. Viele Frauen sind arm und nicht ausreichend über relevante Faktoren einer gesunden und sicheren Schwangerschaft informiert. Sie wissen nicht, wer ihnen in ihrer Situation helfen kann.
DAS MOMS FOR MOMS®-PROJEKT75% der Müttersterblichkeit in Kenya sind laut der WHO vermeidbar. Sachkundige Verpflegung vor, während und nach der Geburt kann das Leben vieler Frauen und deren Kinder retten. Eine Entbindung in Sicherheit unter hygienischen Bedingungen ist schon durch kleine, kostengünstige Maßnahmen, wie zum Beispiel regelmäßige Besuche einer Hebamme oder einem Geburt-Kit möglich. Aus diesem Grund haben wir uns mit der Kenyan Midwives Association zusammen-geschlossen. Deren Mission ist es, jeder Frau und einem jedem Kind qualitative Pflege durch eine Hebamme zu ermöglichen.Für jedes verkaufte Produkt unsere Schwangerschaftslinie spenden wir 10%, um notwendige Materialien für eine sichere Geburt zu kaufen, wie zum Beispiel Bettlaken, Handschuhe & Seife, sowie Informationsmaterial und Sicherheitsrichtlinien für medizinisches Personal.Diese Kits für eine sichere Geburt können das Risiko von Infektionen während und nach der Entbindung erheblich reduzieren und die Schwangerschaft für Frauen in Kenia sicherer machen.Bisherige Erfolgserlebnisse der Kenyan Midwife Association:
Steigerung pränataler Versorgung um 88%-96%
44%-62% mehr Anwesenheit von sachkundigem Personal bei Geburten
Steigerung von postnataler Versorgung um 42%-51%
Säuglingssterblichkeit ist von 52/1000 auf 39/1000 gesunken
Kindersterblichkeit ist von 3,1% auf 1,4% gesunken
 WER WIR SINDMaxieDurch meine Großmutter, eine begeisterte Ärztin, und meine Mutter, die sich als Psychologin viel mit der Salutogenese beschäftigt hat, kam ich früh mit Gesundheitsthemen in Berührung. Durch meine erste Firma, Ruby Cup, die erfolgreich eine innovative Lösung für die Menstruation, eine Menstruatinoskappe,  entwickelt und vertreibt, habe ich mein Interesse an natürlicher Frauenhygiene vertieft. Durch meine Zeit mit Ruby Cup in Kenia, in der ich in den Slums mit lokalen Frauengruppen gearbeitet habe, kenne ich mich mit den Begebenheiten vor Ort gut aus. Als ich Schwanger wurde, habe ich mich mit allen Themen rund um das Thema Geburt, Hebammen und Frauengesundheit beschäftigt. Jetzt möchte ich mich mit FEMNA Health durch unser „Moms For Moms“- Projekt für sichere Geburten in Kenia einsetzen.EmilyMein Interesse an der Gesundheit von Frauen wurde ausgelöst, als mein Arzt mir sagte, ich solle die Pille absetzen, denn ich bekam dadurch chronische Migräne. Ich hatte davor seit Jahren die Pille genommen, um die Symptome des polyzystischen Ovar Syndroms (PCOS) einzudämmen. Dank dieser zukunftsorientierten Beratung begann ich erstmalig zu verstehen, was Hormone sind und wie sie funktionieren. Ich begann meinen Körper zu verstehen und zu lernen, was das Beste für mich und meinen Körper ist. Mit Femna möchte ich die bestmöglichen natürlichen Produkte anbieten, um Frauen das Leben zu erleichtern.& FEMNA Health's Power-Women Hannah, Julia, Annie, Gosia, Alessia, Melinaand Loic.    ZEITPLAN

DU HAST FRAGEN?Schau dir unsere FAQs an oder sende uns eine E-Mail an hello@femna.eu.Wir helfen Dir gerne weiter!
FAQsQ: Wann werden die Produkte geliefert?A: Wir werden alle verkauften Produkte unserer Schwangerschaftslinie Ende Oktober versenden.Q: Ich bin nicht schwanger, würde euch aber trotzdem gerne unterstützen. Wie kann ich das am Besten machen?A: Du kannst trotzdem weiterhin sichere Schwangerschaften in Kenya unterstützen indem du z.B. Produkte als Geschenk für eine Freundin kaufst, die schwanger ist oder versucht schwanger zu werden.  Außerdem haben wir auch Gutscheine und ein Schwangerschaftsjournal im Angebot, beides Produkte, die weniger zeitsensitiv sind. Schlussendlich kannst du uns unterstützen, indem du dir unseren leckeren Tee ""Be Bold"" ergatterst - der ist für alle, Männer und Frauen, sehr zu empfehlen.Q: Ich bin erst seit kurzem schwanger. Woher weiß ich, welche Produkte ich in den nächsten Monaten brauchen werde?A: Keine Sorge, genau deshalb haben wir unsere Schwangerschaftslinie in Trimester-Pakete aufgeteilt. Das erste Paket wird in den ersten 3 Monaten eingenommen, das zweite in den Monaten 4-6 und das dritte im letzten Trimester, damit du dich nicht darum sorgen musst, sondern auf deine Schwangerschaft konzentrieren kannst. WIR BRAUCHEN DEINE UNTERSTÜTZUNGBitte teile unsere Kampagne!❤ VIELEN DANK ❤",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

If everybody doesn’t win, then nobody really wins. So when you buy a packet, we give a plant. And if you support some of our bigger goals, we’ll give both bigger and more complex gifts to the communities we work with,  so we all strive together.Power! Moringa is just our first product, we plan on much more. We’re already researching and developing multiple other product lines. Our aim is to continuously bring you powerful products to elevate your health to new dimensions, while you go through life empowering those around you.At the same time we’ll be using a portion of our excess money to develop added strategies to truly improve the lives of the people we work with. We’ll communicate with communities to find out their needs through time: Starting with using the leftover branches to make sustainable charcoal and fight against deforestation, and organise our farmers in a corporation to make sure we work together in the right way.Keep an eye on us and maybe even get involved. We're a lot of fun!Not a dollar wasted! Obviously we’ll be delighted to meet our goals. But should we by chance exceed that goal, we have plans in place to make sure we make the best of the incredible support we receive.

<p>We are proud to announce the launch of SF Squared, as the first fitness company to build gender neutral training facilities in America. By donating to our indiegogo campaign, you can be a part of this reinvention of fitness community and education.  </p>
<p>Turning away from the idea that fitness gyms see you as a dollar sign, we want to make community the cornerstone of the SF Squared company; and instead want to invest back in you. By making a mobile app, we call 'The Squad', we are not only encouraging communication with training professionals, but will make it easier to connect with other members, and get support in training with rewards for making progress. Our investment in your fitness goals continue with training education, with one-to-one personal training in our facility, and outreach boot camp classes in local neighborhoods. However, the best way for us to make sure that no one is left behind, and that we make an inclusive community, is to embrace gender neutrality in all of our facilities. That means that all restrooms, locker rooms / members' lounges will be designed, and constructed with this in mind. We believe that fair and equal treatment isn't just a member agreement to sign, but can be showcased beautifully when incorporated into a fitness space design. As a member and/or client, you want more than just paying a monthly fee, you want to meet your fitness goals, and feel supported along the way. SF Squared is determined to go beyond what traditional gyms offer, and help you get there. </p>
<p>We want your donations, to make this concept a reality. By donating today, your funds will be used to secure and construct our first training studio location, and complete development of our app, ‘The Squad’. We want to change the fitness industry to move away from traditional gyms, and into a new modern training community. One that educates, welcomes, and empowers you. That's why SF Squared is 'Empowering Fitness'! </p>
<p>Our biggest risk - Securing location to build gym</p>
<p>During our search for locations that could be modified, or be turn key, it was apparent that finding the right one that could work, would be difficult. However, by already having the support from the Castro Merchants Association and Castro Business Association, we believe that our search will be much easier. Our timeline to secure the first location (training studio) is by July 2017. This studio will allow for more time to search for a second location, as well as garner public support for a large gym facility to be built in the Castro / Eureka Valley neighborhood. </p>
<p>Second biggest risk - Comfort with Gender Neutrality</p>
<p>Gender Neutrality is a new concept for many people, and we understand that it may be difficult for potential clients and members to embrace a gender neutral (co-ed) locker room space, as well as gender neutrality in training spaces. Our team has laid out a plan through promotion of gender neutrality, and allowing the first location to stand as a model, to fully explain and educate the public. Simultaneously, all staff will be fully knowledgeable to uphold policies against discrimination and sexual harassment. By embracing gender neutrality throughout our facilities, we strive to make a community that is educated in equality, staff that uphold fairness to all, and members who are in agreement of a standard of gym etiquette and respect for one another.</p>
<p>Rewards </p>
<p>For every donation of $50 or more, you receive an SF Squared Thermal Water Bottle (available in grey or blue)</p>
<p>For every donation of $100 or more, you receive an SF Squared Founders T-shirt - Preshrunk Cotton Blend in Grey (available in various sizes)</p>
<p>For every donation of $250 or more, you receive a complimentary training session with Owner/Coach Race Cooper (Only available to residents of San Francisco - Bay Area)</p>

<h3>Gathering to Talk About our Experiences with Race <br/>
</h3>
<p></p>In the wake of Ferguson, I asked friends if they would be interested in meeting for dinner to discuss what was happening in our communities. I received an overwhelming response on social media, and within a week, hundreds of people from San Francisco to London, had expressed an interest in attending a dinner.<br/><br/>With such a show of support, I began compiling resources and looking for venues to host dinners. I decided to call the dinners 'Deliberate Discourse' and in the first three months of 2015 I coordinated 11 dinners in 7 cities in the United States. Each dinner was simple and yet powerful, the way things of the heart tend to be. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448899063/skokmkzsnw8ploljic6c.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
One group from our San Francisco dinner exchanged contact information and planned five more potlucks to continue the conversation they had started. Over 200 people have attended dinners, but the impact does not stop there. Friendships have formed through the power of vulnerability and good communication. I  want to share this experience with others. <br/><p></p>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Use of Funds: Bring More People To The Table <br/>

<p>The money raised will cover the administration and logistical

 dinner 
ticket through this campaign to pay only for the cost of the food 
itself ($35/per person).</p>In addition to organizing the dinners 
(finding the venue, chef, trained facilitators and managing 
communication before and after the events) we will gather stories and 
advice from attendees to <i>create a guide to engaging friends and loved
 ones in conversations about race and personal bias</i>. <br/><br/>

<div>Green Calm is a new kind of nutrient-based supplement for anxiety and mood. It contains a unique blend of vitamins, minerals and a special amino acid designed to support the body's natural calming ability. <br/>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;color: #6eb409;"">For All Forms of Anxiety</h2>
<p>Anxiety can manifest in a variety of ways. For some people it’s chronic and they feel it most of the time. For others it’s more situational and can be brought on by events like work or school, or certain substances like coffee, cannabis, or some medications. Because Green Calm benefits the nervous system on the fundamental level of nutrition it’s helpful for anxiety in all forms.</p>

<p></p>
<br/>
</div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;color: #6eb409;"">Science &amp; Research</h2>
<p>The core of the Green Calm blend is magnesium and P5P (vitamin B6). Research has shown these to be beneficial for anxiety, depression, PMS, ADHD, autism, and other health problems.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18799816"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Magnesium induces anxiolytic-like behavior in mice</a><br/></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25837213"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lower magnesium intake linked to depression</a></p>
<p>For additional support Green Calm contains zinc, R5P (vitamin B2), and niacinamide (B3). These have been shown in research to enhance the function of the core ingredients, and to improve anxiety and depression.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25837213"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lower zinc intake linked to depression</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2005-15416-001"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Case studies show reduction of anxiety with niacinamide</a></p>
<p>And to round out the blend there's a bit of l-theanine. It's an uncommon amino acid found in green tea, and unlike the other ingredients it's not an essential nutrient. Research has shown it to be helpful for anxiety, mood, focus, and for mitigating some of the negative effects of caffeine. It's also very benign on the body compared to other compounds that offer similar benefits.  <br/></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;color: #6eb409;"">What Does Using It Feel Like?</h2>
<div>
<p>The experience of using Green Calm is not like most other anxiety remedies. It isn't an intense, in-your-face sensation. You won't feel like you're ""on something."" Instead, things just go more smoothly and easily. Stressors don't throw you off as much. You might find yourself with more energy, focus, or sleeping easier with an increased supply of nutrients helping your body rebalance.</p>

<p>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;color: #077CE3;"">""When I take Green Calm I'm less anxious, I feel a greater sense of well-being, and bothersome things just don't get to me as much.""<br/></span>– Nancy</p>
<p><br/>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;color: #077CE3;"">""I didn't realize just how anxious I was until I started taking Green Calm. I had gotten used to it. Now my anxiety is a lot better and the difference is obvious.""<span><br/></span></span>– Matt</p>
<p><br/>
<span style=""color: #077CE3;letter-spacing: 0px;"">""I used to have a low level of anxiety all the time, plus sometimes it would become more intense. Since I started using Green Calm I don't have that constant anxiety, and things that used to make me even more anxious like coffee and cannabis aren't a problem.""<br/></span>– Nicole</p>
<p><br/>
<span style=""color: #077CE3;"">""I used to get stressed at work and after my shift everyday for a month my eye would twitch, but I haven't had any panic attacks or shortness of breath and my eye hasn't been twitching at work! I'm loving the Green Calm product.""<br/></span>– Antonio</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;color: #6eb409;"">The Backstory</h2>
<p>Katie and I both have some chronic health problems that we've been dealing with for a while. A few years ago, my doctor had me do genetic testing in an effort to assess and improve my body's methylation system. After finding some disadvantageous genes, she had me use a combination of biologically active nutrients. These made a real difference in how I felt, and in a way that I did not experience from the more common forms of the same nutrients. My mood was better, and I was less prone to anxiety. Katie tried them and had a similar experience.</p>
<p>I already knew a lot about nutrition, and as I did more research on these nutrients I was supplementing with our reactions made more sense. Vitamin B6 is needed by the body for production of the major calming neurotransmitter, GABA, along with other important ones like serotonin and dopamine. Magnesium, zinc, B2 and B3 are important in balancing GABA with it's opposite, glutamate, the major neurotransmitter for activating and speeding up.</p>
<p><b>Ideally, we would get all the nutrients we need just by eating a rich, varied diet of healthful foods and avoiding junk. But many of us don't eat this well, and even if we do it's not always enough.</b> Magnesium, for example, is difficult to get in optimal quantities through food because of modern farming practices and water processing. Our ability to absorb nutrients can be impaired by a dysfunctional digestive system or other obstacles. Some nutrients, like vitamin B6, are often eaten in foods or supplements in a form that is not biologically active, so it requires conversion by the body into the biologically active form before it can be useful. This conversion process can be impaired by a variety of health conditions.</p>

We're a small, independent company with limited resources, and this is a good option for us to connect with people who can benefit from Green Calm. The second reason is to help us recoup some of the costs we invested in the first run, so that we have more funds available for other parts of our enterprise, like research and development.</p>
<p>So, the risks and challenges are minimal, and once the campaign is over and settled all the orders will ship out using inventory that we already have. If the campaign goes especially well and we exceed the inventory produced in the first batch then we can start taking orders for the next batch we produce, which would likely start shipping about 2 months after all the current inventory is claimed.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;color: #6eb409;"">FAQ</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>Who can benefit from Green Calm?</b></p>
<p>The supplement is designed to benefit people who would like to reduce anxiety and balance their mood. There is also research demonstrating that some of the ingredients can be helpful for people with PMS, ADHD, and autism. The ingredients are relatively mild and not likely to cause problems, but if you have health problems or are pregnant please do consult your doctor or other medical professional. </p>
<p><strong>Do you ship to my country?</strong></p>
<p>We ship almost anywhere in the world. Exceptions include North Korea, Somalia, and anywhere else with trade embargoes or mail restrictions from the US.</p>
<p><b>How should I use Green Calm?</b></p>
<p>The recommended dose is 2 capsules per day, though you may take 1 to 4 capsules per day as needed. Taking it with food is typically better than on an empty stomach, and some people prefer having it in the morning, so taking it after your first meal of the day is what we like to recommend. Effects should be noticeable within the first day of taking it. It may take up to a week or more to see maximum benefits as your biological pathways get back up to speed with their newly increased supply of nutrients. Best results come from using it regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Is Green Calm safe for kids?</strong></p>
<p>Generally yes, but they should probably stick with 1 pill per day, and it would be best to consult with your medical professional. The ingredients are as benign as what you'd find in a multivitamin supplement.</p>
<p><strong>I have a hard time with pills. How big are these?</strong></p>
<p>The pills are size 00, and they're about an inch long. If you can't swallow pills at all you can still use Green Calm by pulling the pills open and swallowing the contents with some water or other beverage. The taste is pretty mild, and not something that really needs a coverup. </p>

<p><b>What are the ingredients?</b></p>
<p>Magnesium citrate, zinc citrate, pyridoxal-5-phosphate (B6), niacinamide (B3), riboflavin-5-phosphate (B2), and l-theanine. Plus a plant-derived capsule to contain them. </p>

<br/><p><strong>Does Green Calm contain fillers, gluten, soy, animal products, etc?</strong></p>
<p>Nope! If it's not on the ingredient list it's not in Green Calm. There are no fillers or binders, just the active ingredients contained in plant-derived capsules. No gluten, soy, dairy, nuts, or anything else. </p>
<p><b>So, Green Calm can reduce the paranoia and nervousness caused by cannabis?</b></p>
<p>As with anything the results will vary from person to person, but our research has shown Green Calm to be helpful for this purpose with medical patients here in California. Of course, we only endorse this usage when in accordance with relevant laws.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing Green Calm
Green Calm is a new kind of nutrient-based supplement for anxiety and mood. It contains a unique blend of vitamins, minerals and a special amino acid designed to support the body's natural calming ability. 






For All Forms of Anxiety
Anxiety can manifest in a variety of ways. For some people it’s chronic and they feel it most of the time. For others it’s more situational and can be brought on by events like work or school, or certain substances like coffee, cannabis, or some medications. Because Green Calm benefits the nervous system on the fundamental level of nutrition it’s helpful for anxiety in all forms.

Ingredients









Science & Research
The core of the Green Calm blend is magnesium and P5P (vitamin B6). Research has shown these to be beneficial for anxiety, depression, PMS, ADHD, autism, and other health problems.
Magnesium induces anxiolytic-like behavior in mice
A combination of magnesium and B6 reduce anxiety-related PMS symptoms
Magnesium and B6 reduce ADHD symptoms
Autism symptoms reduced with magnesium and B6
Lower plasma levels of B6 associated with depression
Lower magnesium intake linked to depression
For additional support Green Calm contains zinc, R5P (vitamin B2), and niacinamide (B3). These have been shown in research to enhance the function of the core ingredients, and to improve anxiety and depression.
Lower zinc intake linked to depression
Zinc supplementation reduces anxiety and depression
Niacinamide activates GABA receptors, reduces anxiety in mice
Case studies show reduction of anxiety with niacinamide
And to round out the blend there's a bit of l-theanine. It's an uncommon amino acid found in green tea, and unlike the other ingredients it's not an essential nutrient. Research has shown it to be helpful for anxiety, mood, focus, and for mitigating some of the negative effects of caffeine. It's also very benign on the body compared to other compounds that offer similar benefits.  
Theanine reduces psychological and physiological stress responses
Theanine in the brain releases dopamine and glycine, prevents release of aspartic acid

 

What Does Using It Feel Like?

The experience of using Green Calm is not like most other anxiety remedies. It isn't an intense, in-your-face sensation. You won't feel like you're ""on something."" Instead, things just go more smoothly and easily. Stressors don't throw you off as much. You might find yourself with more energy, focus, or sleeping easier with an increased supply of nutrients helping your body rebalance.


""When I take Green Calm I'm less anxious, I feel a greater sense of well-being, and bothersome things just don't get to me as much.""– Nancy

""I didn't realize just how anxious I was until I started taking Green Calm. I had gotten used to it. Now my anxiety is a lot better and the difference is obvious.""– Matt

""I used to have a low level of anxiety all the time, plus sometimes it would become more intense. Since I started using Green Calm I don't have that constant anxiety, and things that used to make me even more anxious like coffee and cannabis aren't a problem.""– Nicole

""I used to get stressed at work and after my shift everyday for a month my eye would twitch, but I haven't had any panic attacks or shortness of breath and my eye hasn't been twitching at work! I'm loving the Green Calm product.""– Antonio


The Backstory
Katie and I both have some chronic health problems that we've been dealing with for a while. A few years ago, my doctor had me do genetic testing in an effort to assess and improve my body's methylation system. After finding some disadvantageous genes, she had me use a combination of biologically active nutrients. These made a real difference in how I felt, and in a way that I did not experience from the more common forms of the same nutrients. My mood was better, and I was less prone to anxiety. Katie tried them and had a similar experience.
I already knew a lot about nutrition, and as I did more research on these nutrients I was supplementing with our reactions made more sense. Vitamin B6 is needed by the body for production of the major calming neurotransmitter, GABA, along with other important ones like serotonin and dopamine. Magnesium, zinc, B2 and B3 are important in balancing GABA with it's opposite, glutamate, the major neurotransmitter for activating and speeding up.
Ideally, we would get all the nutrients we need just by eating a rich, varied diet of healthful foods and avoiding junk. But many of us don't eat this well, and even if we do it's not always enough. Magnesium, for example, is difficult to get in optimal quantities through food because of modern farming practices and water processing. Our ability to absorb nutrients can be impaired by a dysfunctional digestive system or other obstacles. Some nutrients, like vitamin B6, are often eaten in foods or supplements in a form that is not biologically active, so it requires conversion by the body into the biologically active form before it can be useful. This conversion process can be impaired by a variety of health conditions.

 

Why We're on Indiegogo
We've already had the first batch of Green Calm produced and we're here on Indiegogo for two main reasons. The first is to make our big launch and reach out across the internet. We're a small, independent company with limited resources, and this is a good option for us to connect with people who can benefit from Green Calm. The second reason is to help us recoup some of the costs we invested in the first run, so that we have more funds available for other parts of our enterprise, like research and development.
So, the risks and challenges are minimal, and once the campaign is over and settled all the orders will ship out using inventory that we already have. If the campaign goes especially well and we exceed the inventory produced in the first batch then we can start taking orders for the next batch we produce, which would likely start shipping about 2 months after all the current inventory is claimed.

As the staff nurse at the Thailand teacher trainings and several in Los Angeles prior to that, the overwhelming response I heard from hundreds of trainees is that this unique sequence of yoga postures, performed in the right conditions has physically and emotionally reversed conditions in their lives that were killing them. Straight up. Or lessened conditions that were limiting. Allowing you to be your best, getting closer to realizing what your purpose is, hitting your stride. Regardless of what you may find when you google Bikram Yoga, please know that the physical practice can be life-changing. And all you have to do is start with one class and see what happens.I'll be adding more things to this page during the campaign - pictures, updates, what not. If you'd like to know a little more about me and who you'd be funding, I started a blog a few months ago which I'll be updating with posts as well. You may not agree with everything you read but it is hopefully at best an attempt at being open and genuine. http://randombrown.com. It's also the website link below.

Thank you for reading. Thank you for giving! If you can't give, I don't mind. I still love you, namaste. Please just spread it, live it, love it, visit.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b><i>S.T.R.O.N.G.
isn’t a “gym”, it’s a mindset</i></b>, and our mindset is in the name.  We’re not focusing on breaking PR’s, building glamour muscles,
or asking “how much do you bench?”.…we are focused on helping create a
healthier, functionally stronger, mindfully balanced version of you.  And we are taking a unique approach to make it happen.  What started as a group and personal fitness
venture has now evolved into the ultimate goal of putting multiple wellness providers all under one roof
such as Yoga, massage, self-defense, acupuncture, tai chi, nutrition, and other
well-being services to ensure you reach the balance of <b>“Strong Body
~ Strong Mind ~ Strong Spirit”</b>.</p>
<p>You will see and hear the
following from us more than once:  <b><i>This

community.  </p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b><i>It's a little long, but please keep reading and check out

<p></p>
<p>My name is Patrick McKewen, I
have been involved in health and fitness my entire life.  I have been blessed with athletics that run
through my bloodline, as a direct descendent of an Olympic gold medalist, I
have played almost every sport and excelled naturally.  I hold a national certification and have 30
years of fitness, sports, and martial arts experience, including working as a
Fitness Trainer at a health club in the Northeast, teaching martial arts and
self-defense programs, coaching youth sports, and running a group fitness program
locally in Atlanta.  </p>
<p>I have witnessed first-hand the benefits of
living a healthy lifestyle.  I had my own
journey with amazing results, and recently decided to share my passion and
experience as a way of life by creating S.T.R.O.N.G.  My
students and clients have their own amazing results, from being able to stop
taking blood pressure medications, to successfully defending themselves when in
danger, to lowering their body fat percentage, to reducing their stress levels and
living a more balanced way of life, and so many more success stories!</p>
<p></p>
<p>S.T.R.O.N.G.
started way before I ever thought of running a health and fitness
business.  Like I said, it’s a mindset;
and for a deeper look at the mindset, check out our “doctrine”.  It’s an excerpt from a blog post I wrote
several years ago:

Georgia, Girls on the Run, Breast Cancer Awareness, and Lone Survivor

<br/></div>","Not Just
Any Gym-in-a-Box:
S.T.R.O.N.G.
isn’t a “gym”, it’s a mindset, and our mindset is in the name.  We’re not focusing on breaking PR’s, building glamour muscles,
or asking “how much do you bench?”.…we are focused on helping create a
healthier, functionally stronger, mindfully balanced version of you.  And we are taking a unique approach to make it happen.  What started as a group and personal fitness
venture has now evolved into the ultimate goal of putting multiple wellness providers all under one roof
such as Yoga, massage, self-defense, acupuncture, tai chi, nutrition, and other
well-being services to ensure you reach the balance of “Strong Body
~ Strong Mind ~ Strong Spirit”.
You will see and hear the
following from us more than once:  This
is about community.  A strong and healthy
community.  It's a little long, but please keep reading and check out
our video trailer to see what we mean…
This is in our blood…literally:

My name is Patrick McKewen, I
have been involved in health and fitness my entire life.  I have been blessed with athletics that run
through my bloodline, as a direct descendent of an Olympic gold medalist, I
have played almost every sport and excelled naturally.  I hold a national certification and have 30
years of fitness, sports, and martial arts experience, including working as a
Fitness Trainer at a health club in the Northeast, teaching martial arts and
self-defense programs, coaching youth sports, and running a group fitness program
locally in Atlanta.  
I have witnessed first-hand the benefits of
living a healthy lifestyle.  I had my own
journey with amazing results, and recently decided to share my passion and
experience as a way of life by creating S.T.R.O.N.G.  My
students and clients have their own amazing results, from being able to stop
taking blood pressure medications, to successfully defending themselves when in
danger, to lowering their body fat percentage, to reducing their stress levels and
living a more balanced way of life, and so many more success stories!

S.T.R.O.N.G.
started way before I ever thought of running a health and fitness
business.  Like I said, it’s a mindset;
and for a deeper look at the mindset, check out our “doctrine”.  It’s an excerpt from a blog post I wrote
several years ago:

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Med-eSmart was created by social entrepreneurs and medical personnel
to bring low – cost medical care to children in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Extensive research with doctors, caregivers,
parents and relevant government departments in Zimbabwe, South Africa and
Mozambique has shown us that the average healthcare cost is too high for most
parents.  </span></p>

<p>Med-eSmart is convenient and inexpensive.
We team up with a network of practitioners to offer virtual doctors’ visits and efficient
referrals. Targeting under-served settlements such as rural communities and
informal urban settlements (townships) means low to middle – income families
have an opportunity to guarantee the good health of their children. </p>

more accessible. Here’s how:</p>

Med-eSmart is the
first virtual Doctor mobile application for children in Sub-Sahara.  We provide affordable Doctors’ consultations for children from low income households in rural and marginalized urban settlements
in Southern Africa. Med-eSmart
offers:



We are Med-eSmart: ‘A Doctor For Every
Child™.  At last, a family doctor
without the high cost usually associated with quality medical care. 

Med-eSmart was created by social entrepreneurs and medical personnel
to bring low – cost medical care to children in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Extensive research with doctors, caregivers,
parents and relevant government departments in Zimbabwe, South Africa and
Mozambique has shown us that the average healthcare cost is too high for most
parents.  

The Med-eSmart Difference

Med-eSmart is convenient and inexpensive.
We team up with a network of practitioners to offer virtual doctors’ visits and efficient
referrals. Targeting under-served settlements such as rural communities and
informal urban settlements (townships) means low to middle – income families
have an opportunity to guarantee the good health of their children. 

Med-eSmart makes child healthcare
more accessible. Here’s how:


Through the Med-eSmart app, Rutendo’s mom can
simply send text or pictures of baby’s rash to a doctor and receive instant
advice or have an appointment scheduled. 



Vimbai can talk to a doctor in, real time, on Med-eSmart, about her son’s
diarrhea in the comfort of her home in Gonzoni village. 



Novhuyo’s
grandmother walks 10km to get to the nearest clinic. She then has to wait in a
lengthy queue for hours. That’s all going to change with Med-eSmart’s intuitive
referrals and booking system. 



What started
as a common cold for Mpho went untreated and in a week had developed into  pneumonia. Med-eSmart will provide a
complimentary shuttle service to make sure Mpho always sees a doctor when she
needs to.



Mai Netsai lost baby’s clinic booklet and so
couldn’t see the doctor. Med-eSmart’s
secure cloud servers will ensure that all patient documents are safe,
confidential and accessible on demand. 



Thanks to
Med-eSmart uncle Itai can get a notification on his phone whenever his neice, Taku
is not doing so well.



With
Med-eSmart parents can get prescriptions and manage their children’s dosages
easily on the go or at home. 



With
Med-eSmart, Chenai can easily find encouragement from other mothers when her
little one is ill. Her doctor is also on standby to answer any questions she
may have. 
In short,
Med-eSmart is a complete solution to all pediatric needs.

outside the box thinker with a passion for business. At the age of 17 I took the
rite of passage from boyhood to manhood when I started shaving. About a week later I discovered how negatively ingrown hair could impact a person. Razor bumps and irritation literally hi-jacked my life, making me self-conscious and

<p></p><p>At age 25, my dermatologist explained in layman terms exactly what caused <br/>
the bumps and irritation.</p><p>
He said ""Imagine a bee stinger, when it enters your skin, it causes
swelling, pain and irritation. The stinger is a foreign body and the above mentioned affects are the result of it. Once the stinger is removed the body begins the
healing process and reverses the effects of the bee sting. your body reacts the
same way to ingrown hair, if you free the hair from the skin the bumps and irritation will go away.""<br/>
<br/>
That is exactly how BumpBan works. You gently rub it on any area you shave or  wax, allowing  it to gently free ingrown hair, eliminating the bumps and irritation they can cause. <br/></p><p>*BumpBan does not replace shaving or waxing, it's designed to work after the hair has been removed.<br/>

Everyone has heard of Apple visionary Steve Jobs. He knew his products’ had the
potential to change the way we interacted with technology. He also knew his
limitations when it came to marketing, which is why he left that to people who
were as visionary in that field as he was in his. I agree with this philosophy

He said ""Imagine a bee stinger, when it enters your skin, it causes
swelling, pain and irritation. The stinger is a foreign body and the above mentioned affects are the result of it. Once the stinger is removed the body begins the
healing process and reverses the effects of the bee sting. your body reacts the
same way to ingrown hair, if you free the hair from the skin the bumps and irritation will go away.""

That is exactly how BumpBan works. You gently rub it on any area you shave or  wax, allowing  it to gently free ingrown hair, eliminating the bumps and irritation they can cause. *BumpBan does not replace shaving or waxing, it's designed to work after the hair has been removed.
We've worked tirelessly on this, now after 3 years of development and another 3 more years of being
tested and perfected BumpBan is market ready.
· U.S. patent pending, manufacturing process complete 25,000
units per month capability, fully packaged and already selling online through
various outlets.
· Over 3,000 units successfully sold 
· 5,000 pieces of inventory
All of these expenses came out of pocket, now I need your
help to create our 
As Seen On TV infomercial being offered by Kevin Harrington's marketing
firm, Kevin was an original shark on Shark Tank the TV series. Next to being a good father and husband, launching this is the most important thing in this world to me. I've dedicated everything in getting BumpBan to this stage. I can't express how
monumental this would be for a national marketing to be realized. Allowing others to get the relief and satisfaction of having their confidence restored, as 1000's already have.What
We Need & What You Get
All of the funding we secure will be
utilized for marketing and expansion beyond the 5,000 units currently in stock.
$19,900 will be used as
follows:
(1) 30 second infomercial (1) 60
second Infomercial
Both infomercial spots will air a
total of 202 times on top national cable networks specifically selected to
match our customers' demographic and geographic profile. 
The :30 second spot airs 1x
nationally and 150x regionally and the :60 second spot airs 1x nationally and
50x regionally. 
DRTV
Campaign Deliverables
Professional script-writing, HD-high definition
      camerawork production, & post production/editing of both a :30 and
      :60 (DRTV) Direct Response Television Spot for the product.
The :60 spot includes celebrity ‘King of the
      Infomercial’ Kevin Harrington introducing the product.
Ownership and Licensing Rights of both infomercials

Broadcast Distribution of both spots, nationally and
      regionally on targeted networks and in targeted markets we choose.
Your :60 DRTV spot is featured on Kevin Harrington's E-Commerce website www.AsSeenOnTV.pro for twelve (12)
      months.
Integrated Social Media exposure promoting your
      product/service via press releases, Facebook, Linked In, Pinterest, and
      Twitter.
$5,000 will be used to secure approximately 5,000 additional units of
inventory.*Any additional funding received will go toward building more inventory.

Everyone has heard of Apple visionary Steve Jobs. He knew his products’ had the
potential to change the way we interacted with technology. He also knew his
limitations when it came to marketing, which is why he left that to people who
were as visionary in that field as he was in his. I agree with this philosophy
100%.

We have tried in every way possible to minimize the risk of this campaign. 
We are putting the campaign in the hands of marketing gurus with a track record
of successfully launching products to the world.*If we are unable to reach our total goal EVERY DOLLAR raised will still go towards the marketing and promotion of BumpBan. We will also
keep everyone updated on progress, from start to finish!

<p><i>Robyn deflated all of the arguments, resistance and emotional issues about ‘healthy eating’ that kept me from fully committing myself to it. Nothing—even after 14 years of being a fitness instructor myself—reached me like the clarity, authenticity, and completeness of this approach. Before, food issues took up a lot of space and energy, and I got no results. Robyn totally reversed that: food is not a concern, and I have a whole lot of results. Losing 14 pounds of fat in the last two years is almost irrelevant compared to the emotional freedom, practical ease, and functional elegance of fueling</i>. - Susan Bennett</p>

<p><b>I'm returning full-on to this arena more than 20 years after the publication of my breakout bestseller <i>BodyFueling</i></b>—bringing my matured voice to what I feel is an ""all-hands-on-deck"" moment in inspiring people to live healthier lives. With my new book, I plan to show people it’s not that hard, it’s not confusing, and it’s not a drag. </p>
<p><b>In fact, it’s a <i>great</i> life</b>—eating well, looking good and feeling great, making self-care a priority. Nurturing the best days NOW, today—AND the best odds for long-term productivity and contribution. This is the life I've lived for a quarter of a century, and it is my privilege and responsibility to share it.</p>

</div></div>","Can you imagine the difference it would make if you—and most people—felt clear, confident, happy, and at peace about what's healthy and nourishing? If you not only felt smart and savvy about what to do—but WANTED to do it and LOVED it?In the 20+ years since my bestseller BodyFueling was published by Warner Books, I've been living a healthy, happy life with ease, power and peace regarding self-care. And I've been helping other people joyfully people fuel their bodies and their purpose—so they have the health and life to show for it. Just as I do. 
My approach powerfully connects how you care for yourself every day with your life and the world. And once you get it, it's hard to go back!
This book will unpack that approach completely. It is a provocative, instructive, and transformative manifesto on joyful/smart self-care. It will demystify AND happify living well.
I believe we’re meant to not only live longer but better, healthier, stronger.HEALTHY LIVING—DEEP, NOURISHING, WHOLE SELF-CARE—CAN BE A JOYFUL, NATURAL CHOICE. It can be an experience you cherish, not a chore.
It's possible to be confidently savvy about what to do—and LOVE doing it. But how many people actually HAVE that? Really? And if not, why not?

If everyone believed in that power—and truly knew how to wield it, happily—how much suffering could be prevented? In health care and productivity costs, personally and collectively? In YOU? 
What could YOU do? And what contributions could entire generations of people make if they were not considered “expired” and in fact did not expire, literally or figuratively—but had the energy for long, productive, purposeful lives...while actually relishing the healthy practices that support them?
My work is about helping JOYFULLY people fuel their bodies, lives, and purpose with essential nourishment, from food and exercise to rest, herbs, natural products, and other pillars. NOW. 
Even more than how-tos, my approach delivers a way of SEEING: perspective, mindset, clarity, and context. It's about how we think, how we shift obstacles that come from personal and cultural stories/language/beliefs/assumptions—so that we not only KNOW, but DO. 
That's how we get NOURISHED.

I have a way of helping people distinguish vital info from noisy distractions—and get inspired to apply what they know, happily. You learn how to give yourself what you need—and make it happen. You know what to do, want to do it—and you DO it.  Gladly. (Wouldn't that be something?)
We can experience radical, non-negotiable self-care and healthy living as a privilege and choice, NOT a drudgery. As smart, sexy, fun, beautiful. Whether you do the basics, or get a little more sophisticated. 
Pretty much everyone still struggles with how to know what’s really true about what constitutes a healthy life. And many struggle to some degree with applying what they do know. Pretty much everyone wants to feel in command of this—and confident that there is a streamlined base of practices and habits that really DO reliably boost our odds for a long and healthy life.  
People want to feel like healthy living can be joyful and easy and delicious. And most aren’t effectively told or shown how.



We need to dismantle the myth that “it’s still unclear and we don’t really know what to do.” It’s not unclear—and real people who are making this work need to transmit this to other people. ""The experts"" have the facts—but statistics and costs (and likely your own experience!) show they're not connecting with PEOPLE.
While well-meaning, you might have noticed that health authorities are mostly failing to effectively inform and inspire people about the power we hold over our health and aging destiny. 
Their grim, clinical, dry, negative, presumptive, reductive and sometimes condescending delivery is reinforcing the very resistance they lament. They assume people won't do or like healthy things. And then fret when people in fact don't. (My fitness-trainer manual mentions ""adherence"" and ""compliance"" several dozen times. Need I say more?)
No matter how much science establishes about lifestyle, and about how some populations DO achieve super-healthy longevity—that info  never seems to permeate very far into culture. What does trickle down is presented so mockingly, boringly, obfuscatingly or cynically that people just don't get it, or act on it, or enjoy it. 



I've been watching for over 20 years, and people are still struggling with the same issues I saw as a young author more than two decades ago. There is still SO much confusion and defeatism. Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, arthritis, dementia and other conditions continue to cripple people—and earlier. 
Less dramatic but even more widespread miseries like low energy, digestive distress, chronic pain, and poor immunity impact people’s lives daily—sapping joy and productivity, robbing us all of their best.
And the anticipatory dread of aging and disease is also crippling, along with frustration and shame about not having this “handled.”  
Volumes of research exist to point us to the high-impact essentials, yet so much “reasonable doubt” is created that people continue to accept the stance of helpless victim.
There is arguably more suffering in this area of life (from disease and pain to distraction, discouragement and obsession) than any other.  It’s so painful to see this. Because when healthy living is shared in a way that works, that suffering and loss can be prevented.  
That ""sharing"" is what I do. And it's what NOURISHED will do for a much bigger audience.



I offer a unique, powerful dialogue and exploration that dissolves common but crippling blocks to really LIVING the healthiest, most sustainable life. 
I empower people to be joyful and smart about self-care and healthy living.

A professional writer/journalist/communicator since the age of 16, I have been gifted with an aptitude for understanding, applying, modeling and explaining healthy self-care—and more importantly, a perspective that makes it much more inviting, compelling and palatable than media, health authorities and scientific community do. My messages, approach and particular angle have a place in healing this costly and painful issue, in a way that medicine and authoritative health education (government, media) is not touching. I help people actually powerfully connect how they care for themselves every day with their lives and the world. And I synthesize the optimizing essentials for how to do it.

Check out this post sharing (verbatim) correspondence I recently received from a woman who read my books at age 19 and is now 40:
http://robynlandis.net/when-someone-who-read-your-book-at-age-19-writes-to-you-at-age-40/
Here's what a teacher in Edmonds, WA, said about my work:
Robyn deflated all of the arguments, resistance and emotional issues about ‘healthy eating’ that kept me from fully committing myself to it. Nothing—even after 14 years of being a fitness instructor myself—reached me like the clarity, authenticity, and completeness of this approach. Before, food issues took up a lot of space and energy, and I got no results. Robyn totally reversed that: food is not a concern, and I have a whole lot of results. Losing 14 pounds of fat in the last two years is almost irrelevant compared to the emotional freedom, practical ease, and functional elegance of fueling. - Susan Bennett

(There are hundreds more of those.)

I'm returning full-on to this arena more than 20 years after the publication of my breakout bestseller BodyFueling—bringing my matured voice to what I feel is an ""all-hands-on-deck"" moment in inspiring people to live healthier lives. With my new book, I plan to show people it’s not that hard, it’s not confusing, and it’s not a drag. 
In fact, it’s a great life—eating well, looking good and feeling great, making self-care a priority. Nurturing the best days NOW, today—AND the best odds for long-term productivity and contribution. This is the life I've lived for a quarter of a century, and it is my privilege and responsibility to share it.

WHAT I GET / WHAT YOU GET



I hope for this campaign's funds to help cover a minimum 2 months of working on the book exclusively. This allows me to fully take time off from freelance writing, health coaching, music and other paying work to focus fully on the book and get it done!   The more time off I can totally focus on the book, the faster I will get it done. And the more of an ""advance"" I have, the more such time I have. 


STRETCH GOALS - I'll be extremely grateful to make my base goal. But if I exceed it, that will cover additional time to work on the book (which I may need)...and after that, publishing and promotion. As an editor and artist, I can do cover art, copyediting and at least some of the marketing, but (a) I still have to pay myself :) and (b) I will still need consultants for some of this. To launch the book in a BIG way will take big help, and that would serve more people with my message. I would love for this book to be as or even more successful than my first one was 20 years ago—to impact hundreds of thousands of people with my unique brand of inspiration and information about how to integrate radical self-care into their lives....for a level of health, fitness, energy, and ease that fuels their own contributions.  


My perks are, I think, pretty darn cool!  As a multi-passionate creative—writer, musician, artist, and health coach—there’s really something for everyone. I am delighted to share all my skills and talents in exchange for the funds that will allow me to finish this book expeditiously and bring it to market professionally and strongly. If you peruse the perks, you'll see that I intend to EARN a lot of these contributions by offering my health coaching, my time creating art and writing, and more. CHECK IT OUT!



..........................................................................................................................



MY TRACK RECORD

I have a successful track record with crowdfunding.  I funded my last CD to the tune of $10,000. (Although I fell a bit shy of my goal over at Kickstarter, 99% of my supporters chose to support me in full via Paypal anyway!) I did complete the CD, of course, which came out at the end of 2014.


I get things done: I have published two books with a major publisher(Warner Books) and produced three CDs of original material. My major magazine articles have been published throughout my life, starting at age 16. I wrote 15 journalistic pieces about the primary elections in the past few months—in spite of a full load of freelance writing, schoolwork (I'm getting some trainer certifications), other volunteering, and music.  (Obviously, I have a lot of capacity—it's all the healthy living! :)    With your help, however, I will be able to earmark a few months of completely focused time to deliver this book into the world.)


..........................................................................................................................
RISKS AND CHALLENGES

Certainly any number of life events, including unforeseen illness or injury in myself or family (heaven forbid!) could delay the completion of this book. But as my track record shows (see above) I do get projects done. So even if unforeseen circumstances did occur, the book will still get done and you would get your perks and your book(s).This book is happening!

GA area. Unfortunately we were unable to find a source for organic or even GMO free feed anywhere close, so even though we continued to raise our animals as natural and holistically as we could they were eating some ""conventional"" feed. <br/>Three  years ago we were able to purchase 12 acres to continue our goal.

<h2><strong>GraffitiWall presents: FEL!X!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The FEL!X Apps: </strong><strong>A New Social Skills Software Program Passes First Round of Testing with Autism Patients</strong></p>
<p><strong>FEL!X</strong>, a new software program that teaches social skills like empathy, has successfully passed its first round of testing in a group of patients on the autism spectrum. In a recent test by mental health professionals at the Fort Collins-based University of Colorado Mountain Crest Behavioral Healthcare Center (UCHealth), five patients used the game-like software, which uses historical and literary virtual and live action dramatic roleplaying to teach important social skills like empathy, cultural sensitivity, decision making, and the ability to read social cues.</p>
<p><strong>A Huge Success</strong></p>
<p>Part of the <strong>FEL!X</strong> process includes patients stepping into the shoes of various characters such as Benjamin Franklin, Cleopatra and Aristotle, then as themselves to discuss current subjects such as immigration like social acceptance. The <strong>FEL!X</strong> role-playing technique establishes a fun and safe way to delve into, explore and better understand problems and solutions common to humanity. <strong>FEL!X</strong> helps patients build socially acceptable behaviors like these, so that with practice, they become more routine.</p>
<p>Mental health professionals at UCHealth say there were surprised how much their patients enjoyed interacting both with the historical figures and willingly sharing their personal experiences--and problem-solving suggestions--with each other. Additionally, even though the patients ranged in age from 16 to 63 and came from a wide range of levels on the autism spectrum, they engaged in lively discussions and demonstrated great respect and patience towards one another. Weeks later, the patients continue to display improved levels of social confidence.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Watch some from our advisory team of brilliant Asperger patients, describe the power of dramatic role-playing.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ihCJKVfzac?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><strong>Creating a Safe and Trusting Space </strong></p>
<p>“<strong>FEL!X</strong> uses displacement, allowing patients to delve deeply into issues to explore relationships from multiple points of view,” said Dr. Kenneth Watanabe, a psychiatrist and the medical director of the UCHealth Mountain Crest center. “It creates an environment for patients to practice and master therapeutic techniques. <strong>FEL!X</strong> can be used as a fun, relaxing activity, and as a distraction mechanism, to avoid harming oneself and others.”</p>
<p><strong>FEL!X</strong> was developed by GraffitiWall, a New York City-based immersive software developer. The <strong>FEL!X</strong> Team includes Linda Gottfried, the founder and creative director at GraffitiWall along with her brother, Joseph Gottfried, MD, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Mountain Crest center. Dr. Gottfried recognized the program’s potential to help his patients on the autism spectrum, and formed an advisory team for <strong>FEL!X</strong> that is now made up of patients, medical staff, educators and business leaders. After the first test of <strong>FEL!X</strong> with his patients, Dr. Gottfried is now committed to exploring the potential of <strong>FEL!X</strong> with more patients.</p>
<p>Coming off a very successful <a href=""https://youtu.be/zUv-Q7Q9GeM"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>FEL!X</strong></a> event at UCHealth  the <strong>FEL!X</strong> production team is further developing HIPPA-compliant and secure applications, which can run on mobile devices, laptop and wearables and includes multimedia chatting and sharing. The apps are customizable, allowing mental health professionals and teachers the ability to continually add and tweak fun activities to best fit their patients and students. There are robust assessment capabilities allowing therapists to better understand patients’ progress.</p>
<p>The first version of <strong>FEL!X</strong> is aimed at helping people who have autism spectrum disorder, since it’s been shown that autistic individuals often benefit from roleplaying everyday situations. <strong>FEL!X</strong> encourages users to step out of their everyday lives and into the shoes of historical and literary figures, so it gives them a chance to confront a variety of challenging obstacles, as well as share their experiences more honestly and safely. At the same time, <strong>FEL!X</strong> lets therapists who are working with the program guide their patients more effectively.</p>
<p>In the United States, some 3.5 million people now live with some form of autism. For many, autism makes it difficult to correctly interpret facial expressions and emotions, as well as show empathy, and that often causes them to be ostracized and bullied.</p>
<p>While the first version of <strong>FEL!X</strong> helps patients understand and respond to social cues, later versions will address topics like dealing with bullying, cyber privacy, and LGBTQ issues. As a result has applications for education, human resources, and cultural sensitivity.</p>
<p>Thanks to <strong>FEL!X</strong>’s success, the team is now designing <strong>FEL!X</strong>-based events specifically for middle and high school students in the upcoming school year. <strong>FEL!X</strong> advisors are currently working with historians and tech leaders, such as Andy Mink of the National Humanities Center based in Durham, N.C., to engage students in building historical empathy through dramatic role-playing. </p>

<p><strong>FEL!X has a New Star Advisor! </strong></p>
<p>Before the drumroll, here’s <strong>FEL!X</strong>’s brief history. Handful of years ago, Janina Quint, an award winning filmmaker, learned about the multiplayer game, <i>Choices Change yOUR World</i>, we designed for the Children’s Museum of Manhattan. This game was part of the museum’s larger school initiative and an extension of Michelle Obama’s <i>Let’s Move!</i> Project. The game taught families, that healthy and unhealthy lifestyle choices not only affect an individual but it has a direct affect on the community at large. As the executive director describe this effort: </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“Our goal is to change behavior and the power and flexibility of GraffitiWall® enables us to meet that mission. It gives us the tools to reach out and increase communication with our audiences exponentially.”</p>
<p>Janina suggested we rejig the software to teach kids ethics. Henceforth: <strong>FEL!X</strong> was born. Mary Ann McNair joined forces and we continued to snag talented folks to join the team. Janina stepped aside but thankfully she joined the <strong>FEL!X</strong> advisory team, which she continues to wear its hat. We continue to have a great team but Mary Ann, also needed to step fully down due to other projects and commitments. She chose to don the advisor cap and she is proud to join the luminary advisory board. We’re thrilled that she will continue to play a role in this important initiative. She deeply believes in the importance of <strong>FEL!X</strong>, and in the differences it can make. As an educator and historian, Mary Ann is dedicated to inviting people to better understand the past, in order to be more thoughtful and compassionate citizens. Thank you, MA. </p>
<p><strong>Our Background</strong></p>
<p>GraffitiWall has created an extensive list of multimedia immersive platforms for audiences, ranging from healthcare, to museums, to education, and television. Their touch screen programs at the Colorado History Museum, The National Archives, The Denver Zoo, The Denver Art Museum, The Montclair Art Museum and the Children's Museum of Manhattan were wildly popular and helped build audience by opening the door for visitors to see themselves as part of the story. Additionally interactive multiplayer games have been designed to teach and encourage changing behaviors, such as those built for museums and hospitals. </p>
<p>One of GraffitiWall's greatest achievements was our extremely successful second screen experience created for the AMC/Sundance Channel Global's most popular show <i>Breaking Bad</i>. Via the <i>Breaking Bad</i> GraffitiWall, fans could select from a cast of <i>Breaking Bad </i>avatars to role-play within virtual representations of the show's locations before, during and after the show aired. This created a show within a show. Not only did the <i>Breaking Bad</i> GraffitiWall initiative encourage tune in, but by the end of its run, the <i>Breaking Bad </i>GraffitiWall had more members than AMC/Sundance Channel Global's fan base on Twitter, and more members than it had viewers of this Emmy Award Winning show.</p>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""Better Ask Saul!"": video sneak preview of the game within the<i> Breaking Bad</i> GraffitiWall</strong></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<p>After selling its social media patent portfolio to the largest internet and gaming Chinese firm, GraffitiWall staff committed to focusing on social justice initiatives. On one of our projects, we worked with the NYU Langone Medical Center's Rusk Institute of Rehabilitative Medicine and wheelchair-bound teen patients to design a 3-D simulation software. In this software, able-bodied users experience the world from the vantage of a wheelchair to better understand the realities and successes of disabled people. </p>
<p><b>GraffitiWall's Evolution Is FEL!X!</b></p>
<p>The common thread in GraffitiWall's interactives is an invitation to users to immerse themselves in situations that are outside their everyday experiences. From navigating the world in a virtual wheelchair, to holding Albert Bierstadt's palette of oil paints while deciding how to tell a visual story, to sending a telegraph to save an 1870s steam engine from plunging off a bridge, to walking through <i>Breaking Bad  </i>locations as the key characters of the show, users step into the shoes of others. </p>
<p><strong>Focus on Social Justice</strong></p>
<p>After the last few Presidential elections, the GraffitiWall team discussed the finger pointing, name calling, and lack of discussion and deep listening that is required to help people find common ground. Since then, the political climate has only grown more volatile, and people have become more insular.</p>
<p><strong>FEL!X</strong> was born to address this problem.</p>
<p>After Linda's brother Joe, a top psychiatrist in Colorado, saw <strong>FEL!X,</strong> he immediately recognized the potential power it has to assist mental health professionals and their patients, and joined the team. Dr. Joe and his colleagues suggested focusing on patients with Asperger Syndrome because they are often brilliant, creative, and techie, while needing to develop social skills.</p>

<p><strong>The Need</strong></p>
<p>As much as the general population could use help in being more empathetic and thoughtful, the challenge for these patients is greater still. They often have difficulty reading facial expressions and body language, which throws up an extra hurdle for understanding social cues. Patients have shared with us that they sometimes carry with them flash cards of facial expressions and the emotions they reflect to help them decipher what is going on with the people around them. Others tell us they work on their own facial expressions by looking at themselves in the mirror and memorizing the correct movements for showing happiness, sadness, confusion, and anger. In many cases, the displaying of emotions is quite foreign.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>We are developing <strong>FEL!X</strong> in phases, beginning with this effort—<strong>Phase 1</strong>—the creation of the face-to-face and online activities. We will follow up in <strong>Phase 2</strong><strong> </strong>with a push to develop more multiple mobile and wearable applications, allowing patients instant access to the help they need at all times, and from multiple devices.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481311213/dvblhznfkljtuj6uiw9z.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Revenue Model</strong></p>
<p>It is standard practice for users to pay monthly subscriptions for health oriented mobile apps. Unfortunately most haven't been tested for efficacy. Not only will <strong>FEL!X </strong>be rigorously tested by patients and healthcare professionals, it will offer a set of fun, robust, and customizable activities, along with a backend that gathers behavioral data from multiple touch points. This will better inform both the patients and their healthcare providers on patient progress.  <strong>FEL!X</strong> uses the subscription model, licensing the software as a service to healthcare facilities. Both the healthcare entities and <strong>FEL!X</strong> share revenue from patients' monthly subscriptions. For more details contact us at Linda@GraffitiWall.com.</p>
<p><strong>Content Management System</strong></p>
<p><strong>FEL!X</strong> is cutting edge. Joe and his colleagues are constantly searching for tools that will enable their patients to practice techniques to build self awareness and increased empathy. With <strong>FEL!X</strong>, patients can work on their own without feeling judged, and at the same time, in-depth data on the actions of individual patients, as well as in the aggregate, is collected by therapists via a robust backend. The system's flexible templates allow the addition and growth of activities and topics, as well as the ability to expand to wider audience types. In this way, the learning process is expedited for patients and their doctors. With practice, patients are able to make socially acceptable behavior more routine for themselves, and perhaps even overcome some of the obstacles they face in trying to comfortably blend into society.</p>
<p><strong>Roll out Plan</strong></p>
<p>Under the guidance of our advisors at the University of Colorado Mountain Crest Behavioral Healthcare Center, the roll out is to start small and focussed. As we rigorously test <strong>FEL!X</strong> and get user feedback from our Asperger team, we will expand to more therapeutic techniques, implement the software with patients diagnosed with a broader range of issues, and continually add more content and topics targeted to a range of age groups. Mountain Crest has also shown a desire to expand into the community, reaching out to local schools and community centers. In parallel, we are developing <strong>FEL!X</strong> for multiple markets, such as education, human resources, and political advocacy. </p>
<p><b>Robust Visual Data!</b></p>
<p><strong>FEL!X</strong> users can document their role-playing via videos selfies, as well as readily chat and share content within a closed social media platform designed specifically for them. The cross-platform software can be used on mobile devices, wearables, laptops, and desktops, to provide immersive, experiential activities. This also provides in-depth user data from multiple touch points. For example, by incorporating the ability to rate heartbeats before, during, and after <strong>FEL!X</strong> activities, including points of high-drama role-playing, the range of time-stamped measurements provides additional visual progress reports. Added to the patients’ video selfies, keyword collection, and the robust tracking capabilities on the backend, healthcare professionals will have an enhanced understanding their patients, both individually and in the aggregate.</p>

<p><strong>Our Patient and Healthcare Professional Advisory Team</strong></p>
<p>Joe helped form an advisory team of patients and mental health professionals from the University of Colorado Health's Mountain Crest Behavioral Health Center. Each patient in this program is unique. Some are funny. Some are extremely proficient in many ways. Some are more social than others. But each one is fascinating. Everyone on the team has already provided us with great insights. They unanimously selected the topic of understanding social cues as the first topic to address with <strong>FEL!X</strong>. Their primary goal is to build a vocabulary of facial expressions, body language, and appropriate language to use in social settings. </p>
<p><strong>Progress to Date</strong></p>
<p>At this point, we have mocked up scenarios in terms of content and visuals, and we have storyboarded the front and backend features. We also have a fully operational GraffitiWall that we will utilize. Our tech lead/programming guru is lined up and ready to go, and has been providing us with valuable information as we work. In the past we worked with him on walk-in museum environments, so we are fully aware of the range of his abilities. His resume includes one of the first walk-in, software-controlled, interactive environments, Sony Wonder, as well as work with Levi's, Harper Row, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's ECHO Learning Center, and Audible.com, among others. As we said, he is a guru and knows how to make software user friendly, engaging, and just plain fun!</p>
<p><strong>You can Help</strong></p>
<p>The patients and staff at UCHealth's Mountain Crest Behavioral Health Center are thrilled to find a tool that will allow patients to not only mimic expressions, but to better understand why people feel the way they do in difficult situations. The doctors at Mountain Crest believe in the power of <strong>FEL!X </strong>to make this happen. And so do we.</p>
<p>Join us in making this important change a reality. We appreciate contributions of any size. You can also help by connecting us directly with groups and individuals you think might be interested in <strong>FEL!X</strong> or could benefit from it. Your feedback is always welcome!</p>

<p><strong>GRAND TOTAL: $57,200</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deliverable details:</strong></p>
<p><strong>FEL!X </strong>is a personal project of ours that we feel passionate about, which is why Dr Joe is donating his expertise for Phase 1 and the remainder of the team are donating the main bulk of their time. Below are the deliverables for Phase 1's prototype:</p>
<p><strong>Working prototype includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spruce up existing GraffitiWall infrastructure, including updating chat functions to be more robust and mobile friendly</li>
<li>Create user-friendly templates for the content management system (CMS)</li>
<li>Develop a fully working component: The first will be recognizing, perfecting and properly responding to social cues</li>
<li>Begin an archive of video selfies of character dramatization that patients can use as a reference to perfecting social cues</li>
<li>Gather information on what data patients, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals would like to collect to more effectively improve behavior</li>
<li>Work on connecting wearable info within backend</li>
<li>Videotape the process: Record dramatizations of individual and group role-playing scenarios, including mental health facilitation</li>
<li>Update the realtime virtual role-playing capabilities, using avatars online and mobile</li>
<li>Begin rigorous <strong>FEL!X</strong> testing for efficacy </li>
</ul>
<p>If we receive more funding than requested, some of the excess will be utilized for developing multiple mobile apps. (See below for more details.) We are anticipating building more <strong>FEL!X</strong> components that address bullying, dating tips for autism spectrum patients, cyber privacy, and LGBTQ issues. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal of $52,000, the funds we collect will be used to fund a face-to-face version of <strong>FEL!X </strong>and create a low-tech content management template using various editing tools such as Google Sheets and Docs.</p>
<p><strong>A Woman Can Dream.....</strong></p>
<p>Some crowdsourcing campaigns go well over the amount requested. If we are fortunate to reach our ultimate target of approximately $184,000, the chart below illustrates the projected uses of those funds. (This includes the Indiegogo/credit card 10% charges.) Having this amount would enable us to create a robust set of mobile apps, the desktop content management system, and the activities for real-time role-playing activities. We would also be able to hire actors to role-play the sample scenarios, which serve as visual guides and a reference for users. Fingers are crossed!</p>

The FEL!X Apps: A New Social Skills Software Program Passes First Round of Testing with Autism Patients
FEL!X, a new software program that teaches social skills like empathy, has successfully passed its first round of testing in a group of patients on the autism spectrum. In a recent test by mental health professionals at the Fort Collins-based University of Colorado Mountain Crest Behavioral Healthcare Center (UCHealth), five patients used the game-like software, which uses historical and literary virtual and live action dramatic roleplaying to teach important social skills like empathy, cultural sensitivity, decision making, and the ability to read social cues.
A Huge Success
Part of the FEL!X process includes patients stepping into the shoes of various characters such as Benjamin Franklin, Cleopatra and Aristotle, then as themselves to discuss current subjects such as immigration like social acceptance. The FEL!X role-playing technique establishes a fun and safe way to delve into, explore and better understand problems and solutions common to humanity. FEL!X helps patients build socially acceptable behaviors like these, so that with practice, they become more routine.
Mental health professionals at UCHealth say there were surprised how much their patients enjoyed interacting both with the historical figures and willingly sharing their personal experiences--and problem-solving suggestions--with each other. Additionally, even though the patients ranged in age from 16 to 63 and came from a wide range of levels on the autism spectrum, they engaged in lively discussions and demonstrated great respect and patience towards one another. Weeks later, the patients continue to display improved levels of social confidence.

Watch some from our advisory team of brilliant Asperger patients, describe the power of dramatic role-playing.

Creating a Safe and Trusting Space 
“FEL!X uses displacement, allowing patients to delve deeply into issues to explore relationships from multiple points of view,” said Dr. Kenneth Watanabe, a psychiatrist and the medical director of the UCHealth Mountain Crest center. “It creates an environment for patients to practice and master therapeutic techniques. FEL!X can be used as a fun, relaxing activity, and as a distraction mechanism, to avoid harming oneself and others.”
FEL!X was developed by GraffitiWall, a New York City-based immersive software developer. The FEL!X Team includes Linda Gottfried, the founder and creative director at GraffitiWall along with her brother, Joseph Gottfried, MD, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Mountain Crest center. Dr. Gottfried recognized the program’s potential to help his patients on the autism spectrum, and formed an advisory team for FEL!X that is now made up of patients, medical staff, educators and business leaders. After the first test of FEL!X with his patients, Dr. Gottfried is now committed to exploring the potential of FEL!X with more patients.
Coming off a very successful FEL!X event at UCHealth  the FEL!X production team is further developing HIPPA-compliant and secure applications, which can run on mobile devices, laptop and wearables and includes multimedia chatting and sharing. The apps are customizable, allowing mental health professionals and teachers the ability to continually add and tweak fun activities to best fit their patients and students. There are robust assessment capabilities allowing therapists to better understand patients’ progress.
The first version of FEL!X is aimed at helping people who have autism spectrum disorder, since it’s been shown that autistic individuals often benefit from roleplaying everyday situations. FEL!X encourages users to step out of their everyday lives and into the shoes of historical and literary figures, so it gives them a chance to confront a variety of challenging obstacles, as well as share their experiences more honestly and safely. At the same time, FEL!X lets therapists who are working with the program guide their patients more effectively.
In the United States, some 3.5 million people now live with some form of autism. For many, autism makes it difficult to correctly interpret facial expressions and emotions, as well as show empathy, and that often causes them to be ostracized and bullied.
While the first version of FEL!X helps patients understand and respond to social cues, later versions will address topics like dealing with bullying, cyber privacy, and LGBTQ issues. As a result has applications for education, human resources, and cultural sensitivity.
Thanks to FEL!X’s success, the team is now designing FEL!X-based events specifically for middle and high school students in the upcoming school year. FEL!X advisors are currently working with historians and tech leaders, such as Andy Mink of the National Humanities Center based in Durham, N.C., to engage students in building historical empathy through dramatic role-playing. 
Now Let's Meet the FEL!X Team

The FEL!X team is made up of GraffitiWall's Linda Gottfried along with Linda's brother, Joe Gottfried, MD, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the University of Colorado's Mountain Crest Behavioral Healthcare Center. The FEL!X platform takes advantage of GraffitiWall's successes and takes it to the next level. 
As Founder and Chief Creative Director, Linda has conceptualized and developed innovative and acclaimed immersive platforms. Her clients include AMC Networks, Aventis Pasteur, Macmillan Publishers, Smithsonian, JetBlue, Williams College, Dr. Seuss, Pharmacia, Time Warner, Philips NV, Scholastic, Konica, and AOL, as well as many cultural organizations. FEL!X has many stelaar advisors, including Mary Ann McNair, who is an educator, historian, interactive content developer, digital storytelling facilitator, and award-winning, seasoned museum professional, currently focusing on digital media and helping people find their own voices and making meaning from their lived experiences. 
FEL!X Advisors

FEL!X has a New Star Advisor! 
Before the drumroll, here’s FEL!X’s brief history. Handful of years ago, Janina Quint, an award winning filmmaker, learned about the multiplayer game, Choices Change yOUR World, we designed for the Children’s Museum of Manhattan. This game was part of the museum’s larger school initiative and an extension of Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! Project. The game taught families, that healthy and unhealthy lifestyle choices not only affect an individual but it has a direct affect on the community at large. As the executive director describe this effort: 
“Our goal is to change behavior and the power and flexibility of GraffitiWall® enables us to meet that mission. It gives us the tools to reach out and increase communication with our audiences exponentially.”
Janina suggested we rejig the software to teach kids ethics. Henceforth: FEL!X was born. Mary Ann McNair joined forces and we continued to snag talented folks to join the team. Janina stepped aside but thankfully she joined the FEL!X advisory team, which she continues to wear its hat. We continue to have a great team but Mary Ann, also needed to step fully down due to other projects and commitments. She chose to don the advisor cap and she is proud to join the luminary advisory board. We’re thrilled that she will continue to play a role in this important initiative. She deeply believes in the importance of FEL!X, and in the differences it can make. As an educator and historian, Mary Ann is dedicated to inviting people to better understand the past, in order to be more thoughtful and compassionate citizens. Thank you, MA. 
Our Background
GraffitiWall has created an extensive list of multimedia immersive platforms for audiences, ranging from healthcare, to museums, to education, and television. Their touch screen programs at the Colorado History Museum, The National Archives, The Denver Zoo, The Denver Art Museum, The Montclair Art Museum and the Children's Museum of Manhattan were wildly popular and helped build audience by opening the door for visitors to see themselves as part of the story. Additionally interactive multiplayer games have been designed to teach and encourage changing behaviors, such as those built for museums and hospitals. 
One of GraffitiWall's greatest achievements was our extremely successful second screen experience created for the AMC/Sundance Channel Global's most popular show Breaking Bad. Via the Breaking Bad GraffitiWall, fans could select from a cast of Breaking Bad avatars to role-play within virtual representations of the show's locations before, during and after the show aired. This created a show within a show. Not only did the Breaking Bad GraffitiWall initiative encourage tune in, but by the end of its run, the Breaking Bad GraffitiWall had more members than AMC/Sundance Channel Global's fan base on Twitter, and more members than it had viewers of this Emmy Award Winning show.

After selling its social media patent portfolio to the largest internet and gaming Chinese firm, GraffitiWall staff committed to focusing on social justice initiatives. On one of our projects, we worked with the NYU Langone Medical Center's Rusk Institute of Rehabilitative Medicine and wheelchair-bound teen patients to design a 3-D simulation software. In this software, able-bodied users experience the world from the vantage of a wheelchair to better understand the realities and successes of disabled people. 
GraffitiWall's Evolution Is FEL!X!
The common thread in GraffitiWall's interactives is an invitation to users to immerse themselves in situations that are outside their everyday experiences. From navigating the world in a virtual wheelchair, to holding Albert Bierstadt's palette of oil paints while deciding how to tell a visual story, to sending a telegraph to save an 1870s steam engine from plunging off a bridge, to walking through Breaking Bad  locations as the key characters of the show, users step into the shoes of others. 
Focus on Social Justice
After the last few Presidential elections, the GraffitiWall team discussed the finger pointing, name calling, and lack of discussion and deep listening that is required to help people find common ground. Since then, the political climate has only grown more volatile, and people have become more insular.
FEL!X was born to address this problem.
After Linda's brother Joe, a top psychiatrist in Colorado, saw FEL!X, he immediately recognized the potential power it has to assist mental health professionals and their patients, and joined the team. Dr. Joe and his colleagues suggested focusing on patients with Asperger Syndrome because they are often brilliant, creative, and techie, while needing to develop social skills.



The Need
As much as the general population could use help in being more empathetic and thoughtful, the challenge for these patients is greater still. They often have difficulty reading facial expressions and body language, which throws up an extra hurdle for understanding social cues. Patients have shared with us that they sometimes carry with them flash cards of facial expressions and the emotions they reflect to help them decipher what is going on with the people around them. Others tell us they work on their own facial expressions by looking at themselves in the mirror and memorizing the correct movements for showing happiness, sadness, confusion, and anger. In many cases, the displaying of emotions is quite foreign.

The Opportunity
We are developing FEL!X in phases, beginning with this effort—Phase 1—the creation of the face-to-face and online activities. We will follow up in Phase 2 with a push to develop more multiple mobile and wearable applications, allowing patients instant access to the help they need at all times, and from multiple devices. 


Revenue Model
It is standard practice for users to pay monthly subscriptions for health oriented mobile apps. Unfortunately most haven't been tested for efficacy. Not only will FEL!X be rigorously tested by patients and healthcare professionals, it will offer a set of fun, robust, and customizable activities, along with a backend that gathers behavioral data from multiple touch points. This will better inform both the patients and their healthcare providers on patient progress.  FEL!X uses the subscription model, licensing the software as a service to healthcare facilities. Both the healthcare entities and FEL!X share revenue from patients' monthly subscriptions. For more details contact us at Linda@GraffitiWall.com.
Content Management System
FEL!X is cutting edge. Joe and his colleagues are constantly searching for tools that will enable their patients to practice techniques to build self awareness and increased empathy. With FEL!X, patients can work on their own without feeling judged, and at the same time, in-depth data on the actions of individual patients, as well as in the aggregate, is collected by therapists via a robust backend. The system's flexible templates allow the addition and growth of activities and topics, as well as the ability to expand to wider audience types. In this way, the learning process is expedited for patients and their doctors. With practice, patients are able to make socially acceptable behavior more routine for themselves, and perhaps even overcome some of the obstacles they face in trying to comfortably blend into society.
Roll out Plan
Under the guidance of our advisors at the University of Colorado Mountain Crest Behavioral Healthcare Center, the roll out is to start small and focussed. As we rigorously test FEL!X and get user feedback from our Asperger team, we will expand to more therapeutic techniques, implement the software with patients diagnosed with a broader range of issues, and continually add more content and topics targeted to a range of age groups. Mountain Crest has also shown a desire to expand into the community, reaching out to local schools and community centers. In parallel, we are developing FEL!X for multiple markets, such as education, human resources, and political advocacy. 
Robust Visual Data!
FEL!X users can document their role-playing via videos selfies, as well as readily chat and share content within a closed social media platform designed specifically for them. The cross-platform software can be used on mobile devices, wearables, laptops, and desktops, to provide immersive, experiential activities. This also provides in-depth user data from multiple touch points. For example, by incorporating the ability to rate heartbeats before, during, and after FEL!X activities, including points of high-drama role-playing, the range of time-stamped measurements provides additional visual progress reports. Added to the patients’ video selfies, keyword collection, and the robust tracking capabilities on the backend, healthcare professionals will have an enhanced understanding their patients, both individually and in the aggregate.



Our Patient and Healthcare Professional Advisory Team
Joe helped form an advisory team of patients and mental health professionals from the University of Colorado Health's Mountain Crest Behavioral Health Center. Each patient in this program is unique. Some are funny. Some are extremely proficient in many ways. Some are more social than others. But each one is fascinating. Everyone on the team has already provided us with great insights. They unanimously selected the topic of understanding social cues as the first topic to address with FEL!X. Their primary goal is to build a vocabulary of facial expressions, body language, and appropriate language to use in social settings. 
Progress to Date
At this point, we have mocked up scenarios in terms of content and visuals, and we have storyboarded the front and backend features. We also have a fully operational GraffitiWall that we will utilize. Our tech lead/programming guru is lined up and ready to go, and has been providing us with valuable information as we work. In the past we worked with him on walk-in museum environments, so we are fully aware of the range of his abilities. His resume includes one of the first walk-in, software-controlled, interactive environments, Sony Wonder, as well as work with Levi's, Harper Row, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's ECHO Learning Center, and Audible.com, among others. As we said, he is a guru and knows how to make software user friendly, engaging, and just plain fun!
You can Help
The patients and staff at UCHealth's Mountain Crest Behavioral Health Center are thrilled to find a tool that will allow patients to not only mimic expressions, but to better understand why people feel the way they do in difficult situations. The doctors at Mountain Crest believe in the power of FEL!X to make this happen. And so do we.
Join us in making this important change a reality. We appreciate contributions of any size. You can also help by connecting us directly with groups and individuals you think might be interested in FEL!X or could benefit from it. Your feedback is always welcome!
 

What We Need for Phase 1 and What You Get
Phase 1 Deliverable: Working Prototype 
UCHealth Mental Health Professionals will facilitate the activities with a select group of patients on the autism spectrum to develop and test the activities. We will also gather data for further analysis.

Total Project Goal: $52,000 (details below)
Project management: $7,000
Research and content: $7,000
Design, research, and user interface: $7,000
Programmer: $10,000
Videography: $2,000
Rent ten iPhones, iPads and Apple series 1 Watches: $10,000
T-Mobile phone service (12 months @ $250 per month for 10 6-gig lines: total $3,000
Web hosting: 12 months: $6,000
--------------------------------------------
SubTotal: $52,000
plus
Indiegogo and credit card fees of 10%
GRAND TOTAL: $57,200
Deliverable details:
FEL!X is a personal project of ours that we feel passionate about, which is why Dr Joe is donating his expertise for Phase 1 and the remainder of the team are donating the main bulk of their time. Below are the deliverables for Phase 1's prototype:
Working prototype includes:

Spruce up existing GraffitiWall infrastructure, including updating chat functions to be more robust and mobile friendly
Create user-friendly templates for the content management system (CMS)
Develop a fully working component: The first will be recognizing, perfecting and properly responding to social cues
Begin an archive of video selfies of character dramatization that patients can use as a reference to perfecting social cues
Gather information on what data patients, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals would like to collect to more effectively improve behavior
Work on connecting wearable info within backend
Videotape the process: Record dramatizations of individual and group role-playing scenarios, including mental health facilitation
Update the realtime virtual role-playing capabilities, using avatars online and mobile
Begin rigorous FEL!X testing for efficacy 

If we receive more funding than requested, some of the excess will be utilized for developing multiple mobile apps. (See below for more details.) We are anticipating building more FEL!X components that address bullying, dating tips for autism spectrum patients, cyber privacy, and LGBTQ issues. 
If we do not reach our goal of $52,000, the funds we collect will be used to fund a face-to-face version of FEL!X and create a low-tech content management template using various editing tools such as Google Sheets and Docs.
A Woman Can Dream.....
Some crowdsourcing campaigns go well over the amount requested. If we are fortunate to reach our ultimate target of approximately $184,000, the chart below illustrates the projected uses of those funds. (This includes the Indiegogo/credit card 10% charges.) Having this amount would enable us to create a robust set of mobile apps, the desktop content management system, and the activities for real-time role-playing activities. We would also be able to hire actors to role-play the sample scenarios, which serve as visual guides and a reference for users. Fingers are crossed!

The process helps to educate, clear and optimize the mind, removing unnecessary emotional blockages. This is obtained by establishing the natural self-reliance, resetting obsolete emotional imbalances, and improving the management of thoughts and feelings. The process consequently clears the associated mental struggles and byproducts, ie. anxiety, fear, low self-confidence, depression, alcohol and drug abuse, procrastination, etc. Most importantly it frees misused brainpower, which can be reinvested into confidence, high performance and happiness.</p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The peaceful mind’s environment attained by the method discontinues the unnecessary releases of </span>Adrenaline, Cortisol and Norepinephrine<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">, which are the powerful hormones used by the brain to respond to danger in the ""fight, freeze or flight"" process.

In the early 1890, Luca’s grandfather invented concentrated orange juice, establishing himself as one of the first Italian Industrialists.</p><p>Luca’s history is an eclectic mix of experiences that meshes perfectly with his passion to increase human happiness and self-reliance. At an early age, Luca began receiving extensive spiritual teachings from a channeled holy master.

This experience launched Luca into his first career, investment banking. At 28, Luca established his investment portfolio in Luxemburg with offices in London and New York. His company focused on portfolio management, VC investments and M&amp;A.</p><p>In the 2005, after more than two decades of sharing his life between his healing mission and the world of banking, he sold his business and moved to Los Angeles to establish his Bosurgi Method® School and Los Angeles practice.

I had been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, had been deemed a lost cause by friends and family, I was arrested several times for DUI's, and had been to countless hospitals and rehabilitation centers. Feeling hopeless and alone, I was finalizing my plan of escape from the world. By the Grace of God, I found Luca Bosurgi. What happened next changed my life forever, and I promise it will change yours too.           I had been through a decade of traditional cognitive therapy with virtually no results. Looking for answers, I traveled and searched, assiduously investigating every self-help movement that was available.

It wasn’t until Luca explained to me his groundbreaking discovery of AED (adult emotional dependency) that I understood for the first time what my problem had been all these years. It was like the weight of the world had been lifted off me. There is so much more to say about my many amazing discoveries, life-changing lessons and eye opening experiences-- but I must leave them for the book! My role is to add color, commentary, structure, and my own personal journey to the THE MIND FITNESS BOOK. Luca Bosurgi’s twenty five years of experience and training, prodigious faith, and revolutionary breakthroughs in psychology of the mind are going to help change the world for generations to come, as they have done for me.  I was lucky enough to get this help. Many are not. Helping co-author this book is both my honor and my mission. I have to help give back what was so abundantly given to me. I truly believe that Luca is on the cutting edge of solving depression and addiction once and for all. This is something the world needs right now, and with God's blessing, we are going to do everything in our power to help spread this technology."" -LukaLuka Pecel has written and collaborated with celebrities like Michael Bolton, Teri Hatcher, Sasha Alexander, and David Carradine just to name a few.

The Mind Fitness program derives from the Bosurgi Method® - Luca Bosurgi's 12 steps healing modality. The method developed with 25 years of clinical researches and successfully tested with over 5,000 people is a proprietary program of life and mind coaching combined with CognitiveOS Hypnosis®. The process helps to educate, clear and optimize the mind, removing unnecessary emotional blockages. This is obtained by establishing the natural self-reliance, resetting obsolete emotional imbalances, and improving the management of thoughts and feelings. The process consequently clears the associated mental struggles and byproducts, ie. anxiety, fear, low self-confidence, depression, alcohol and drug abuse, procrastination, etc. Most importantly it frees misused brainpower, which can be reinvested into confidence, high performance and happiness.The peaceful mind’s environment attained by the method discontinues the unnecessary releases of Adrenaline, Cortisol and Norepinephrine, which are the powerful hormones used by the brain to respond to danger in the ""fight, freeze or flight"" process. This frees the body from the intoxication and the muscular tensions produced by the chemicals, allowing noticeable physical improvements. Luca's clients have reported reduction of muscular and back pain, headache and gastrointestinal conditions – improved sleep and stamina, and substantial enhancements in physical health, complexion and attractiveness.The Mind Fitness program is complementary and enhances most reputable therapeutic modalities.

If you don't fulfilled this need, your mind will starve, and will try to grab love from partners, friends or colleagues.4th week: Self-protection – your mind needs your protection or will experience constant anxiety and fear, trying to get safety from people, religious organizations, teams and groups etc.5th week: Self-Leadership – your mind needs your leadership, without it will work on autopilot trying to be led by the external world.6th week: Emotional Independence – now you are ready to formalize your self-reliance, transforming dependency to inter-dependency.7th week: Building emotional self-reliance – this week is dedicated to build a master behavior of self-reliance that will be applied to different aspects of your everyday life.8th week: Reset your survival system – clear unchartered anxiety and fear.9th week: Removing self-judgment – reset and capitalize the past as fuel for the future removing shame, guilt and regret from past experiences.10th week: Removing resentment and blame – reset and capitalize the past as fuel for the future removing blame, resentment, anger and pain.11th week: Clear daily stress – shifting thoughts from needs to choices.12th week: Manage thoughts, feeling and emotions.The proceed of the raised funds will be invested in the production and marketing of the 'Mind Fitness Book' and the interactive eBook, and to build and establish the Mind Fitness website. Your generous contribution will help to accelerate the production and to create awareness throughout the US territory.

In the early 1890, Luca’s grandfather invented concentrated orange juice, establishing himself as one of the first Italian Industrialists.Luca’s history is an eclectic mix of experiences that meshes perfectly with his passion to increase human happiness and self-reliance. At an early age, Luca began receiving extensive spiritual teachings from a channeled holy master. By the time he was becoming an adult, Luca had acquired groundbreaking knowledge about the meaning of life, the spirit-mind hierarchy, the mechanics of the mind and how it relates to mankind’s journey of spiritual evolution.Luca studied Business & Law at the University Bocconi in Milan. At 23, he was called on to rescue his family company, Sanderson & Sons in Messina, Sicily. In three years, Luca saved 1,500 jobs and secured the continued production of approximately 25,000 citrus farmers. This experience launched Luca into his first career, investment banking. At 28, Luca established his investment portfolio in Luxemburg with offices in London and New York. His company focused on portfolio management, VC investments and M&A.In the 2005, after more than two decades of sharing his life between his healing mission and the world of banking, he sold his business and moved to Los Angeles to establish his Bosurgi Method® School and Los Angeles practice. This began Luca’s 12-year-long journey towards perfecting the first three phases of the Bosurgi Method, and has allowed him to enhance and refine his method–improving his success rate from the initial 65% to more than 95% in the last four years. Today, thousands of people have experienced the Bosurgi Method, not only with Luca, but also with the approximately 20 mind healers that he has trained.In 2014, Luca identified Virtual Reality as an effective channel to bring the Bosurgi Method® to the general public. This motivated him to build a team and, based on the Bosurgi Method, develop a Virtual Reality Mind Training solution. The efficacy of using VR as a delivery mechanism for the Bosurgi Method® was tested and proven out in beta testing, showing results that equaled those he obtained in his practice – exceeding 95%.In 2015, following his vision to create a higher performing, emotionally independent and happy world, Luca founded Mind Fitness Lab, a portfolio company established to invest, develop and distribute disruptive mind solutions. Currently, the Bosurgi Method® VR ( the Virtual Reality version of the method) is licensed, packaged and distributed as a VR experience through  Mind Fitness Lab – recognized on the 2016 TransTech 200 list of key technologies driving mental and emotional well-being forward.Additionally, Luca is a Medicine Man (Shaman) according to Native American traditions, known by his spiritual name Red Cougar Mountain Spirit. He is also highly trained in ancient combat and martial arts (black belt in judo and karate), and initiated in Western and Easter mind-body disciplines.Luca consistently seeks effective ways to impart greater balance and healing to those in need. He discovered the power of Clinical Hypnosis in the early 1990’s in London. He was individually trained by Michael Joseph, Founder and President of the British Society of Clinical Hypnosis and publisher of the European Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. Clinical Hypnosis, combined with his comprehensive knowledge of computer and digital science, metaphysics, psychology and ancient mind/spirit healing techniques, became the foundation of Luca’s new form of psychotherapy, the Bosurgi Method®. Luca lives with his wife and three children in Santa Monica, California.""I've never met anyone who can so effectively give someone the tools to live their life with confidence quite like Luca.  Without his help I would not have the success I have today, which stems solely from an ability to live myself and be confident in all aspects of my life - things that Luca enabled me to do. I am so grateful for his help and his ongoing friendship"" -John

Luca has helped me and all my family to embrace efficiency and happiness in our life. I’ve been supporting Luca’s Virtual Reality venture, The Mind Fitness Lab financially and personally as CFO from the 2014 and I’m excited to be part of this new development of his groundbreaking program. His discoveries about the mind, combine with his proven method, offered in a form that everyone can use, will certainly help many to remove alcohol and drug addictions, anxiety and depression and embrace a powerful and happy life.

She has been playing in the field of leading edge consciousness ever since. “ After participating in the Mind Fitness Lab Virtual Reality program just once, I was so impressed with the reduction of my stress levels and the self awareness that I was gaining that I asked Luca to be a guest speaker for my practitioners internationally, knowing that the more clear and coherent their minds are…the more effective they would be in working with energetically sensitive children and families. I  went onto deeper and deeper results by using the VR program a few more times. I recently had the opportunity to do private sessions with Luca, which clearly supported my ability to get out of my own way, allowing my creativity and potential to flow in new and beautiful ways!  Luca is a wonderful human being with a clear mission to support as many as he can to be all that they are here to be! He does that very well!” Suzy MillerVinicius is a Brazilian Computer Scientist specialized in Digital Signal Processing.  From the 2013, hi co-operated with Luca Bosurgi, leading  the sister company Mind Fitness Lab's development team. He is now leading the digital development of the Mind Fitness Network products.""Luca is an expert when it comes to understanding the mind, it's habits, and how one can change their mindset with precision and speed. It's been a huge part of my growth as an entrepreneur. In even a few sessions I was having deeper awareness and insights about my own thinking and the thinking of others that would have taken me years to come to understand on my own or through reading. When you use your brain to be creative, you need a way to conserve and focus it's power. Mind Fitness shows you how.""""Luca Bosurgi is a very special man. Luca blessed with a divine grace that you will only understand when in his presence. He has completely changed my life forever. I know something now, which Luca has helped me to achieve, that I have never known before. I have access a source of strength inside my mind that was always there – but Luca showed me how to use it. The deep love and happiness I have found through working with Luca is truly awe-inspiring. I will never be able to fully articulate the gift that Luca has shared with me. I give Luca my highest recommendation and only hope that he will continue to do his good work for others for as along as he can.

"" Christine “Our vision is to help create a community of psychologically independent, high performing, and emotionally self-sufficient people. I have researched the mind for over 25 years and identified the unfulfilled needs that restrain millions of people in a cage of dependency, under-performance and fears. I also identified the rational key for permanently ending psychological dependency in a very short time. Our mission is to offer this awareness and mind training methodology to our communities to help bring humanity to a healthier, more efficient and joyful place.Together, we can create an interdependent society of people – based on being, instead of trying to be; on choosing, instead of being chosen; on our real identities instead of the ones mirroring external expectations. We can help millions to free their mind from fears and thereby enhance their performances and compassionate intelligence so as to move our communities into the next wave of inventions, accomplishments and, most importantly, harmonious accord.

Under the Ground Force brand, each healer that develops a nutraceutical would be given credit and, more importantly, a percentage for each bottle sold.</p><p>ABOUT ME</p><p>Before starting Naturopathic Medical School at 29, I completed my undergraduate degree in Organic Chemistry and worked in the private sector for 6 years. But, it really wasn't fulfilling for me. While scanning graduate programs in hopes of enhancing my degree in chemistry and having a greater desire to help individuals, I came across the field of Naturopathic Medicine. I knew immediately this was what I was supposed to do for the rest of my life.</p><p>Fast forward through 4 years of med school at one of the eight accredited schools in North America for Naturopathic Medicine and 2 years in practice. I realized (a) it’s really hard to start your own practice and; (b) there are still combinations and variations of nutraceuticals yet to be discovered.</p><p>How are these things related you might ask? Well, who better to develop new supplements than the experts themselves (especially ones who recently got out of school and had to memorize all the vitamins, minerals and 300 herbs to take their board exams)?</p><p>But, Dr. Sara you might say, “with tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, how can a new doctor or herbalist or nutritionist start their own supplement company?” This is where Ground Force Supplements comes into play.</p><p>By giving to this campaign, you would not only fulfill my dream of starting a supplement company, but you would be supporting a new idea in this field bringing together day-to-day practitioners. You will also be assisting established and dedicated healthcare providers see their own ideas come to fruition while helping to supplement their income.</p><p>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</p><p>To manufacture a single customized supplement, at a minimum production amount, costs range anywhere between $8,000 to $12,000 (this does not include distribution/fulfillment, label development or marketing). With the $17,000 I’m hoping to raise, thanks to you all, Ground Force Supplements will manufacture its first supplement developed by Dr. Keith Zeitlin, Naturopathic Physician (<a href=""http://5elementsnhc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5elementsnhc.com</a>) and myself in the Fall of 2018. The product is still a bit ‘top secret’ as its never been manufactured before, but let’s just say, it will change how people (especially children) are able to take an already widely used nutrient.</p><p>The profits from this new product will go towards helping another healer develop and launch their own supplement(s).</p><p>In gratitude, everyone that contributes will receive a gift; starting with a inspiration sticker and working up to free supplements and being a guest of honor at a Ground Force Supplement launch party.</p><p>Now, don’t feel like this is an all or nothing thing. There are many levels of support. Every penny donated helps a healer in the art of complementary and alternative medicine develop new and innovative nutraceuticals.</p><p>IMPACT</p><p>What’s great about this product line is that it will be developed by the pros, the people recommending them on a daily basis. It will help address the needs missing from the market today, while providing a passive income stream to those who work so hard in our healing journey.</p><p>There are 350-400 new Naturopathic Medical School graduates each year leaving school very much in debt and expecting to start a business, pay exorbitant license fees and malpractice insurance.

Under the Ground Force brand, each healer that develops a nutraceutical would be given credit and, more importantly, a percentage for each bottle sold.ABOUT MEBefore starting Naturopathic Medical School at 29, I completed my undergraduate degree in Organic Chemistry and worked in the private sector for 6 years. But, it really wasn't fulfilling for me. While scanning graduate programs in hopes of enhancing my degree in chemistry and having a greater desire to help individuals, I came across the field of Naturopathic Medicine. I knew immediately this was what I was supposed to do for the rest of my life.Fast forward through 4 years of med school at one of the eight accredited schools in North America for Naturopathic Medicine and 2 years in practice. I realized (a) it’s really hard to start your own practice and; (b) there are still combinations and variations of nutraceuticals yet to be discovered.How are these things related you might ask? Well, who better to develop new supplements than the experts themselves (especially ones who recently got out of school and had to memorize all the vitamins, minerals and 300 herbs to take their board exams)?But, Dr. Sara you might say, “with tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, how can a new doctor or herbalist or nutritionist start their own supplement company?” This is where Ground Force Supplements comes into play.By giving to this campaign, you would not only fulfill my dream of starting a supplement company, but you would be supporting a new idea in this field bringing together day-to-day practitioners. You will also be assisting established and dedicated healthcare providers see their own ideas come to fruition while helping to supplement their income.WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GETTo manufacture a single customized supplement, at a minimum production amount, costs range anywhere between $8,000 to $12,000 (this does not include distribution/fulfillment, label development or marketing). With the $17,000 I’m hoping to raise, thanks to you all, Ground Force Supplements will manufacture its first supplement developed by Dr. Keith Zeitlin, Naturopathic Physician (5elementsnhc.com) and myself in the Fall of 2018. The product is still a bit ‘top secret’ as its never been manufactured before, but let’s just say, it will change how people (especially children) are able to take an already widely used nutrient.The profits from this new product will go towards helping another healer develop and launch their own supplement(s).In gratitude, everyone that contributes will receive a gift; starting with a inspiration sticker and working up to free supplements and being a guest of honor at a Ground Force Supplement launch party.Now, don’t feel like this is an all or nothing thing. There are many levels of support. Every penny donated helps a healer in the art of complementary and alternative medicine develop new and innovative nutraceuticals.IMPACTWhat’s great about this product line is that it will be developed by the pros, the people recommending them on a daily basis. It will help address the needs missing from the market today, while providing a passive income stream to those who work so hard in our healing journey.There are 350-400 new Naturopathic Medical School graduates each year leaving school very much in debt and expecting to start a business, pay exorbitant license fees and malpractice insurance. Ground Force Supplements would help these new Naturopathic docs, along with the  6,000 licensed previously ones and other alternative medical providers, bring their ideas to life while supporting them financially.RISKS & CHALLENGESThe greatest challenge: getting people to buy the products. But as a Naturopathic Doctor, I believe I am best fit to meet this challenge with my already established wholesale supplement company professional accounts and the vast, but close knit, network of Naturopathic Doctors.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our campaign is simple: to raise enough funds so that we may open a strength and conditioning facility in Leland, NC.  This would allow us to get a small business loan so that we can secure a location, buy the equipment we need and become operational before the end of the year. This is important to us because we are tired of seeing countless amounts of people waste their time and hard earned money joining gyms that promise results and deliver nothing. It’s time someone broke away from the norm and focused on delivering healthy results instead of receiving profit.  Our dream is to be a beacon of hope in the Leland community in terms of health and fitness for those who believe they have none. Our hope is to provide a location where you can receive high quality, all inclusive structured training at a low cost. We want to help create a healthy community by promoting other businesses involved with health and fitness.  With your help, we can achieve this together. Results first, profit second.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $40,000 in order to secure a loan so that we can be operational by the end of the year! We are currently looking at loan options so in the event that a loan is secured before the campaign is over, funds will go toward equipment and establishing a location.</p>
<p>What you get!</p>
<ul>
<li>$50 contribution- T-shirt</li>
<li>$100 contribution- T-shirt, Unlimited membership @ $100/month for a year</li>
<li>$500 contribution- T-shirt, 6 months unlimited membership free</li>

<p>In the event that our goal is not reached, funds will still go toward securing a small business loan. If a loan is secured, the funds will go toward equipment and location. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We wish that we could put into words the impact that this facility will have on the community and surrounding communities. Truthfully, the impact is unfathomable.  There are a lot of gyms and facilities out there that promise people “real results” and are short on delivery. There are a lot of products that promise so much yet get you so little. The impact that we want to have is to change people’s idea of fitness. We want to make fitness a lifestyle, not a fad. We want to help people go from, “I want to look like him or I want to look like her” to “I want to be a part of that”. Just imagine a gym where everyone there is working together, as a team, to accomplish the same thing. To be fit and healthy!</p>
<p>This will be a gym where everyone there is supportive of each other and are treated as teammates instead of members. That’s infectious. That is something that spreads like wildfire and in turn will impact so much more than just the physical body. We have to change your habits and thought process about fitness before we can change your body. We can promise you this; You will work hard for your results and we will help you. You will work hard to be healthy and we will be there every step of the way. There is no secret to fitness. There is no particular gym or product that will get your there, just good old fashioned work. Out of that work will come something amazing. Self-efficacy, self-esteem, confidence, success, and most importantly, community!</p>

<li>Financial debt</li>

<p>Obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Finances</li>
</ul>
<p>Fitness is my passion.  I have been very successful at the gyms and clubs I have worked for and that was only possible by putting in the necessary work.  Clients were not given to me. I had to learn how to sell personal training and I had to put in hundreds of calls a day in order to build the clientele I needed in order to make the money I wanted. I have a great understanding of what it takes to make and run a successful business.</p>
<p>Right now the only obstacle I can see is financial.  I don't have the $115,000 that I need in order to become operational. I am looking into loan options but need some funds in order to secure a loan.</p>
<p> Competition is minimal, at best, in Leland.  There is absolutely nothing like what we want to build. In a community that is growing fast it is only a matter of time before more fitness studios open. If we were the first to open we would most definitely stand out among the crowd and provide a product that  is elite and beneficial for the community. I have a B.S. in Exercise Science and an elite level certification. It is my passion and dedication to the members and clients that separates me from the competition. I will live by this quote, “people first, profit second”.</p>

<h3>Our Story. Natural Healing through Native Botanicals.</h3>
<p>Our ancestors gave us a beautiful way of life and a path to help heal ourselves and others. In the spirit of Indigenous Peoples' Day—we're asking our relatives and community to be part of our dream.  As a Native American/Lakota family from the Pine Ridge Reservation, we are bringing our indigenous healing traditions into modern wellness through our company, Native Botanicals.  We're making sustainable wellness available today and for future generations.</p>
<p>Growing up surrounded by our culture, we learned about our traditional healing ceremonies and medicines from our elders and medicine people. Native Botanicals was born out of a need to become healthier ourselves, and to help others in our community to find a path to wellness through Lakota remedies. We've seen the power of our medicines first hand, and now we want to share them with the world.</p>
<p>Our company is bottling indigenous herbal remedies into medicinal tinctures. Traditionally, these medicines are taken as a tea, but by concentrating the essence of these plant medicines into tinctures, we can modernize their application and share them with more people.  In addition to tinctures, we’ve developed other products that include healing salves, smudging herbs, and sprays that encourage environmental wellness. All of our products use ingredients that are wisdom-backed by Lakota elders, and incorporate traditional medicinal herbs like sage and yucca.</p>
<p>We respect our medicines, and are mindful of the balance between what we give and take. In our Lakota language we say Mitakuye Oyasin, which means ""all my relations,"" and we acknowledge our plant medicines as relatives. That's why a portion of our profits goes toward our reservation replanting initiative, to grow plants and herbs and teach native youth how to use and care for our traditional medicines so we can all thrive — now and in the future.</p>
<p>As important as protecting the plant nation, it's equally important to preserve the knowledge and teachings that come with them. Our ancestors had the foresight to share this wisdom with us, and we’re passing it along through our work.</p>
<p>While Native American wisdom has become popularized, it’s also increasingly misused. The misappropriation of our culture dilutes it and puts it in danger of not surviving. The moment has come for native people to thrive through our way of life and show others to respect our people and plant medicines—reclaiming our authentic power.  It's also time for people to recognize the true healing power of Lakota remedies.</p>
<p>We're living in a world where racial injustice is a movement, people seek holistic protection for their well being, and sustainability is necessary for our long-term survival. The moment has come to support indigenous-owned businesses like Native Botanicals.</p>

The Impact
A portion of all proceeds funds our replanting initiative on the Pine Ridge Reservation.  We're working to end over harvesting and extinction of endangered plants that we use as medicine. 

Replanting Sweetgrass, Cottonwood trees and other medicines 
Showing our Native youth how to care for them, respect them and use them in a traditional way


Risks & Challenges

I am a pro bodybuilder. I was one of the representatives of Muscle Mania in Korea from 2014-2017 and received the No.1 bodybuilder championship. Unfortunately, I got injured 3 weeks before the competition and my coach didn’t think I would be the bodybuilder afterward. I thought my athletic career was over. I was very frustrated and couldn’t accept the fact that I can’t be the bodybuilder anymore.However, instead of giving up, I started doing balance training to recover from the injury and finally I won the championship I attended. Based on my experience, in order to spread the balance training out further, I created FAVE.Through our Indiegogo campaign, I hope everybody will be healthy and have so much fun while exercising with FAVE.”   Strong friends (INC) are starting to get rid of why they can't exercise for everyone in the world. Starting with Balance Training, Strong friends will create a sports platform that anyone can learn from professionals around the world.And that's the beginning of ""Smart Balance Trainer, FAVE."" We're the tech company, and we're the global fitness platform company where people all over the world change their lives. Since the FAVE creation, there have been many technological challenges, both in terms of hardware and software. Being a hardware company, we know that a non-perfectly functional product can damage the company permanently. We also understand that software development is crucial both for treating and presenting efficiently the massive amount of data gathered, as well as providing pleasant user experience. Even if we waited as long as possible before revealing our prototype to the public, we received a lot of attention from many people in the health-care industry. So flattered! Our focus is now to complete this campaign well and ship you our FAVE! We are beyond excited to bring you a product that will make you proud and healthy!! Thank you. TEAM FAVE.​",64.0,1,"1 Campaign
