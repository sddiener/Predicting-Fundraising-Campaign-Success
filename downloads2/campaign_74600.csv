several companies developed that provided a new market called <i>aircraft

program or structure with the focus on General Aviation jets.<span>  These programs are based on the sale of
flying time called a “wet lease” (normally used for short term leasing) where
the purchaser does not necessarily fly the aircraft. Significant cost factors
for the buyer occur as they pay for pilot, airtime and fuel. These are the
primary costs that affect these fractional operations; however,

ownership without supplemental management brings a number of responsibilities,
which are at times daunting to say the least. Supplemental management relieves
the owner of the day-to-day responsibilities but at additional costs. The partnership
option can lead to liabilities and/or disputes in management, due to

This will create costly challenges for the airlines and General Aviation
(including higher-end fractional companies) to maintain the crews and replenish

requires that a pilot must have these flight hours, which could cost well over
$300.00 hour or more depending on the aircraft and training facility.  </p><p>

<h3>Welcome to Project ""SMNS""</h3>
<p>Project ""SMNS"" or Social Media &amp; Networking Software is a projected designed to build cheap but powerful software that will give everyone the tools to setup their own social media or network site. The software is designed for Artists, Film Makers, Designers, Developers and Gamers, enabling them to build community websites based on sharing content &amp; media. <br/><br/> With a lot of software being rather exspensive, not having the desired features, taking up a lot of resources or not very SEO friendly. We're hoping to solve that problem by creating a software that can suit multiple purposes, optimized for good SEO and enabing anyone regardless of budget to start their own network. Without being filled with a lot of useless features, heavy and hard to use UI or requiring coding knowledge. <br/><br/> The software is being developed for the users and with that in mind, we’ll be asking you to request features you want to. We will also be allowing users to suggest and select an official name for the software on release. <br/><br/> If you want to create a site for a studio, you can.<br/> If you want to create a site for a gaming news network, you can.<br/> If you want to create a social site for artists, musicians, gamers, you can.<br/> If you want to create a site to share mods, downloads you can.<br/> If you want a community forum you can.<br/> If you want a site to manage your gaming league or network, you can.<br/> And more.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What are some of the Major Features?</h3>
<p>The system will come with some the following features on release:<br/><br/><strong>Built For Many</strong> - The software is planned to come in 3 packages, included in the same download. While installing the software users will be taken through and interactive UI which will have 3 (currently planned) Options. <strong><em>Basic</em></strong> - which will be for single users to upload and share their content. This option is for portfolios, popular youtube channels or things of that nature. <strong><em>Community Lite</em></strong> - Will contain the most used features of the software, allowing you to setup a community for sharing content which will also include a forum. <strong><em>Community Pro</em></strong> - Will be filled with every and anything featured on launch that the user can take full advantage of. A full list of features that will be in each version, will be provided during developement. <br/><br/> Each version is designed to ensure only the features needed are used, to ensure a smaller database, optimizing loading speeds and to limit the amount of options are thrown at the user. HOWEVER do not worry, users can install or enable certain features even after a version of the software is selected. Each version also has the option to install and enable any add-on or feature.</p>
<p><strong>Full Template System</strong> - Allowing users to install and change themes to suit their needs, will be easy to use and just as easy to edit or add new themes. Allowing designers to go wild and create stunning themes without having to get stuck on confusing syntax or large amount of code. <br/><br/><strong>Add-on Support</strong> - Allowing developers to easily and effectively create add-ons or apply modifications to the exsisting code. We're taking a whole new approach to developement with add-ons and plan to have more infomation on this later on. However we plan to ensure that installing and removing add-ons is very easy, no files will be mixed up and allows users to easily clean through add-ons they no longer wish installed. <br/><br/><strong>Full SEO</strong> - After years of experience with SEO and how search engines tend to work, we will be making SEO a primary feature with the software. Making sure that content and sites get high ratings for the search terms used.<br/><br/><strong>Language System</strong> - English will be supported on release, however we'll be making it very easy to support other languages right out of the box. By creating a easy to use and edit language system, users will be able to adjust the languages or provide their own language files for others to install and use. We'll be trying to add as much language support as possible during developement.</p>
<p><strong>Much more - </strong>we can't honestly can't list all the features that will be included at this time. There is a lot of them. But rest assured everything we feel you'll need to upload, sort and manage a community and a wide range of media will be included.</p>
<br/> (Concept Photo Attached)<br/><img alt=""site concept one"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://thedanzorlabs.com/project/siteconcept.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Sub-Features will the software have?</h3>
<p>The current smaller features are planned for launch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full reporting system, which will have the option for the community to moderate what is and isn't accepted on the site</li>
<li>Organize information through galleries, folders and catagories that will be easy to find and use. Making sharing content easier and better for everyone.</li>
<li>No coding exsperiance will be needed to setup, manage and run the software</li>
<li>Community Forum, allow the community to talk on a public forum, or use it as a help desk.</li>
<li>Pages System, create addtional pages and easily add them to menus or articles.</li>
<li>Powerful user profiles, users will be able to customize and showcase their profiles and even use them as CVs if enabled.</li>
<li>Upload media types such as images and videos, later on we plan to support music as well.</li>
<li>Permission Masking, have groups of members to access different features, from members, artists, moderators and administrators.</li>
<li>Advertisements, add your own ads to make money from users</li>
<li>Article system, The article system will enable users to create news articles and publish them in a professional manner, both for large and small content sites.</li>
<li>Privacy Options, Privacy is a big concern for us and we don't want our software to be abused. We will be making a lot of options to project user information. Including encrypting email address (used to login), passwords and all sensative information. Also requiring very little information to register and maintain an account with the software (this will change depending on the community / website though to some degree).</li>
<li>Social networking features, share content on facebook,twiiter,reddit and other networks easily for more exspoure.</li>
<li>Off and on, Turn the site on and off to apply updates or maintaince, allowing only staff members into the site at the time.</li>
<li>Mobile Support, mobile devices will be fully supported on release on the front end. Allowing tablets and phones to access the site.</li>
<li>Much more, we can't honestly can't list all the features that will be included at this time. There is a lot of them. But rest assurd everything we fell you'll need to upload, sort and manage a community and a wide range of media will be included.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Future Features will the software have?</h3>
<p>We have plans to make it easier for users to make money or self-fund their own communities with things other then ads. A store and subscription option will be added. Allowing users to sell their content through the site or the site to request subscription or payments for additional account features.</p>

<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What About other Uses?</h3>
<p>At the moment, you may have an idea of some of the uses this software can have, however we mentioned gamers earlier and we'll explain how the software can also be used through the add-on system for gamers:</p>
We also plan to release sub-features to appeal to gamers, musicians and other forms of media and entertainment. Such add-ons will allow users to setup events, game results and other useful community features. These features can also be applied or other add-ons developed at a later time, enabling users to use the system to suit their needs. <br/><br/>So if your a community on sharing resources, publishing art, networking people for work, a youtuber or moviemaker, artist, facebook like pages or more. You'll find great tools tailored to making your website easy to use and manage. <br/><br/><h3>How Much Will The Software Cost On Release?</h3>
One of the things we really want to do, is make it as easy and affordable as possible for users to create content driven community websites and share their content with the world. As a result on release, <em><strong>you will pay whatever you want for the software (if you haven't contributed)</strong></em>. Be it 1 dollar or 100dollars, it is entirely up to you. Anyone who funds the project right now, will get the software on release, as well as any rewards for each perk. No matter how much the cost may change in the future, you will still get those perks and the software. <br/><br/><strong>If the project meets it's funding goal</strong>, we'll release the whole thing as an open source project, it won't cost a thing to download or use the software or any of it's options. <br/><br/>We also have plans to provide very cost effective hosting to those who want it. The software will be free with any hosting plan you take out. Shared, VPS, Dedicated or Cloud. So we will happily setup the website for you, to use as you want without having to spend huge amounts of money on software, subscriptions or be left high and dry by poor customer support.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What will the money be used for?</h3>
<p>All the money will be used to cover living costs while the software is in developement, to cover the costs of registering a LC and things of that nature. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>When will the software release?</h3>
<p>We honestly can't say, because of the scale of the project. However there will be a beta before the new year and a full release soon after. That is our goal anyway.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>In Closing</h3>
<p>After 7+ years of experience in web designer and developement, we want to create a software that anyone can easily use to create a community based on sharing user created content. We hope you'll take the time to share or contibute to our project, we hope even more that you'll find it useful. The more the project grows, the more features we can release and the more support we can provide to make things even easier.<br/><br/>A developement blog, facebook and twitter will be live soon, which will have weekly updates on progress and a list containing more information and features. <br/><br/>Thank you everyone. <br/><br/></p>

<p><strong>Why an Ice Ball? Isn't all Ice the same? </strong><br/>Well not so fast, a sphere has the unique characteristics of allowing the most volume to be contained within the least surface area possible. Meaning, an ice ball provides a drink with the least ice-to-alcohol/drink contact ratio possible drastically reducing the speed at which the ice melts. By comparison, crushed ice has low volume &amp; a high total surface area, which is why it melts so fast in your drink. <br/><br/>Sometimes you can find bartenders carving a cube of ice into a sphere for customers. Recently ice ball makers have been replacing this time consuming task. Plus how many people want to carve ice at home for their drinks. Our Ice Ball maker will be one of the first to be manufactured in the United States with an excruciating attention to detail and superior craftsmanship over more expensive units.</p>
<p>Plus my friends and I are Scotch lovers and you can't drink a watery Scotch now can you?<br/><br/><strong>Okay great so that's an Ice Ball but how does it work?<br/> </strong><br/>Our <em><strong>Easy Ice Ball Maker</strong></em> is made of aluminum which has the highest thermal conductivity of any metal that can be reasonable used. As a comparison, stainless steel has about one-tenth the thermal conductivity as the aluminum alloy we use at three times the weight. Meaning a stainless steel unit would weigh about 46 pounds and take approx. 4 minutes to make an ice ball as opposed to the 2.75” <strong><em>Easy Ice Ball Maker</em></strong> weighing about 16 pounds and taking only 90 seconds. <br/><br/>As for the operation - you simply place a block of ice on the bottom half of the <em><strong>Easy Ice Ball Maker</strong></em>, place the top half of the assembly on the guide-rails, and let gravity and the <strong><em>Easy Ice Ball Maker</em></strong> go to work. About a minute later you'll have a perfectly sphere or ice ball to impress yourself, your friends, or your customers with.</p>
<p><strong><em>How Big is that Ice Ball you ask?</em></strong> <br/><br/>2.75"" or 70mm for the Large <em><strong>Easy Ice Ball Maker</strong> </em><br/>2.00"" or 50mm for the Mini <em><strong>Easy Ice Ball Maker</strong>  </em></p>
<p><strong><em>This is IndieGoGo why so expensive? </em></strong></p>
<p>Well believe it or not, our <strong><em>Easy Ice Ball Makers</em></strong> are 50% - 70% less than our competitors. The prices below don't even include the accessories that we include. That's all extra.</p>
<p>Competitor A - $1,448 (2.75” - Japan) <br/>Competitor B - $1,006 (2.50” - Scotland) <br/>Competitor C - $930 (2.95” - UK) <br/>Competitor D - $799 (2.75” - US) </p>
<p>High quality ice ball makers are difficult products to manufacturer.

<h3>What is Gear Cartel?</h3>
<p>We realized that the Independent Ski and Snowboard market is highly fragmented and it is extremely difficult for a consumer to track down unique products they can identify with.

We realized that the Independent Ski and Snowboard market is highly fragmented and it is extremely difficult for a consumer to track down unique products they can identify with.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As an entertainer in Orlando for years I've been looking for the next best thing. Well just about two years ago I found it. I guess founded it is more apt. In January of 2011 I launched A Little Punch Drunk a podcast and Internet radio show that has been growing and changing non stop since episode one. <br/>With very humble beginnings it was two guys huddled over a tiny audio relay splitting one mic and one headset jack. A few months later I had a new host and begin the live video feed durithey'll the recordings. As we continued to grow we began brining on guests like Ed and Gavin from Midnight Syndicate and doing conventions in town like Vuducon and Spooky Empire Mayhem I reached an impass. Brought on by the departure of my current co-hosts I was left short on equipment and partners. So my hope is that with the new your of ALPD and my new team we can raise the money to replace and upgrade the equipment and quality of the show.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The show is trying to raise $2000 for the equipment to improve the quality and overall production of the show. The money will go toward the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>A MacBook Pro ~ better audio and video cards to take the quality to the next level $100-$1500</li>
<li>Portable hard drive ~ to allow me to keep everything safe and in a designated space $100</li>
<li>New cameras ~ for cleaner crisp picture during the video broadcast and multiple angles $120</li>
<li>USB hub ~ ease and accessibility for new tech $30</li>
<li>Headphone splitter ~ for monitor use for all recording $30</li>
<li>Monitor headsets ~ ability to monitor sound quality $120</li>
<li>New mic stands ~ stands for the mics $60</li>
<li>Pop filters ~ screens to stop unwanted sounds in the mics $60</li>
<li>Various cables ~ upgrades to cables improve sound quality $60</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By donating you will be directly responsible for allowing the show to grow. There are plans in place for live events, bookings for conventions, interviews, and much more in store for A Little Punch Drunk. The current project is one where the show hits the road to various haunted or wildly interesting locations in Fl to record. But without the upgrades and missing equipment needed none of it can happen. </p>

<p><em>(Update 8/14): Just got the pricing back -- it turns out that Queen Sized Quilts will run <strong>$850/each</strong> after labor, backing material, edging, embroidery and taxes. Queen Sized is actually pretty big 96"" x 102"". <em>I am having Full Sized Quilts quoted also to see if that will save some money and leave more to give the girls from what is leftover. Also, i</em>f anyone knows how to get us tax exempt status, because this is technically a donation, please let me know, it'll save us about $130 and we can give that to the girls instead!  </em></p>
<p>The quilts will take about 6 weeks to make and should be ready around Sept 30th if all goes well.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone wants to help in some way, but it is difficult to know what to do. Making these quilts will preserve a piece of their mother for the girls and give them an heirloom they can wrap themselves in and feel her presence for years to come.</p>

<h3>Any Extra Funds</h3>
<p>As of 7/17 we have met our initial goal and have enough to go ahead with the quilts!! :-) Any extra $$ raised at this point will go into a fund for the girls and be administered by their Uncle Keith. The girls still need a lot of help beyond the quilts, so thank you so much for anything that you care to donate, it is VERY appreciated. The donations ability at this site will remain open until mid September.</p>
</div></div>","Be sure to check the UPDATES tab for all the latest info and photos as the Quilts are being made!
Even though we've reached our ""goal"", the girls can still use a lot of help, please continue to donate. Every bit helps provide for them now that their mother cannot.

<p>I'm Tabatha, and I'm currently a freelance writer/graphic designer work-from-home-mom to two awesome kids under three years of age and wife to an inner city public school teacher. My son is severely developmentally delayed and has several ongoing health issues, so working out of the home at a traditional job is near impossible with his interventions, therapies, appointments and other care ... not to mention his little sister's very normal needs and care as well. We do okay on my husband's beginner teacher's salary, but after renovating the majority of our century-plus old house over the last five years as well as the cost of care for our son, we don't have a lot left anymore for small extras, nevermind starting a business.</p>
<p>I'm asking for help to convert a partially-finished room in my basement into an office space for not only my writing and graphic work, but for beginning a career in interior design. I've found deep fulfillment in transforming spaces to reflect the people who inhabit them, and I've had increasing interest from others for me to help them with their homes and work spaces. I've been featured on several websites for the unique style of work that I've done in my own home, and I feel a deep drive to take this talent out into the world. I do a lot of work now for barter or trade, but unfortunately that doesn't help me or my family financially.</p>
<p>Right now I work from a corner of my kitchen that also serves as our family's general crap drop off space. I don't have anywhere to think quietly for a minute, or store samples, or even bring people over to see what I do that isn't covered with kid and pet paraphernalia. I need an organized, dedicated space to pursue my dreams and create a way to support my family that is in the best interests of all of us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $3000 to get my business, Tabulous Industries, off the ground from start to finish. The room I want to convert is mold infested and will need to be completely gutted and reconstructed with sealers, mold-resistant drywall, and the concrete floor will need repaired and evened out and refinished. This is work that my husband and I can do ourselves, with the help of some family and friends, and that would also give me something to write about throughout the process for both my own website and some of my freelance jobs, which have started to become few and far between as of late.</p>
<p>I have the desk in the kitchen and some paper storage boxes, but in the way of office furniture that's about it, so resonable furnishings would be a part of the budget. I love finding things at thrift stores and refinishing them, so please know I would be budget-minded as I completed the space.</p>
<p>My laptop is about two years old and is in decent shape, but it does need some repairs to get it up to snuff. I'd really like to have a desktop to do my designing on, but I can make do with what I have as long as I can afford to get it repaired. My phone is also on it's last legs, but I'm not eligible for an upgrade until January 2013 -- and you can't run a business without a phone.</p>
<p>I also want to become a licensed contractor in my area, so that I may work on projects myself as time and childcare allows. One of my favorite parts of transforming a space is actually getting my hands dirty and literally doing it myself. So I would need help with the tests and insurance/bonding costs that come along with that official status.</p>
<p>As for perks, I can offer my services -- writing, interior design, links on my website, DIY labor -- really the options are endless! I love being useful and helping people, so if you have a project in mind I'll do my best to help you with it. </p>
<p>Of course, I know I'm asking for a lot of money and I know there's a chance I won't reach my goal. Whatever funding I do recieve will go towards at least starting this project -- most importantly removing the mold from my home and repairing my computer so that I may continue to work to the best of my abilities with what I have. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Creating my own office space will help me to use my creative inclinations to fuel my passions into a viable buisness to help support my family. I've spent a lifetime being told that artists don't make money and that simply just can't be true. I want to prove to my kids as they grow that you really can be anything you want to be when you grow up, and that there's no shame in following your dreams. I want them to have a mom they're proud of, and I want my husband to have a wife whose choices he doesn't have to defend to outsiders.</p>
<p>By funding my campaign, you will help me make the lives of people happier, one room at a time. You'll enable a small-town girl to follow her heart and have purpose and worth in the world. You'll help a young family not be defined by the bad times they've overcome, but by the succcesses they created together. And you'll be supporting a women-run small business in a time where it's really hard for the little guy to stay afloat on their own.</p>
<p>If you want to see the kind of design work &amp; projects I've done in my own home and at a couple of friend's homes, please visit <a href=""http://turnrightatlakemichigan.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://turnrightatlakemichigan.blogspot.com</a> (my home renovation website) and <a href=""http://www.sotabulous.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sotabulous.com</a> (my personal life blog). I can send you graphic design examples too, if that's more up your alley.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know times are tight for everyone, so if you can't contribute but want to help, then share this campaign through social media, blog about it, shoot me a message and interview me about it, or if you can donate time, services, or materials to help, any and all of that would be so very deeply and gratefully appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my dream, and I hope you have a wonderful day!</p>

My Story
My name is Joshua Miller, and I am a chef. I come from a family of chefs. My grandfather cooked on a Navy Destroyer in WWII and my mother was a cook in a Meditation Ashram where I first started as an assistant cook in 1986.

It's been my dream as long as I can remember to start my own business, to create wonderful food, cooked with love. 

Now, after a long period working with some of the best catering companies in the San Francisco Bay Area... and gaining valuable skills and knowledge in the industry, I am ready to take the wisdom I have gained and apply it towards realizing my dream. I am looking for the right kitchen space in the East Bay or San Francisco which will allow me to begin, and at the same time make a positive impact in a community that I love.


The
Impact
Your donations will allow me to help alleviate world hunger, end our system of political corruption and stop global warming in it's tracks.... Okay, perhaps I'm overstating. I'm a chef, not a rocket scientist! What can I do? 

I can take my skills I learned in the professional culinary world, and the love I learned to cook with in the Meditation Ashram, and look to make people the best tasting, most wholesome food possible.

I can donate any food excess from an event to help those in need.

I can commit to no longer using single-use disposable items, but use multi-use items as much as possible. When not possible, I will use compostable disposables.

I can commit to giving 15% of my profits after tax to the Occupy movement, or if Occupy disbands, any other movement that empowers those who feel powerless.

I can teach what I know, what I am passionate about, so I can pass the torch to the next generation.

I can commit to mentoring other budding entrepreneurs and helping them learn skill sets, see the big picture and most importantly, learn how to treat their obstacles as stepping stones on a path rather than a wall that keeps them from a future.

and, I can commit to paying it all forward. Because, no matter how much each of us have done, we owe a debt we cannot repay to others along our journey. 

finally, I can help young entrepreneurs understand that a mastery of punctuation marks is overrated.... that you can even get your idea across with a run-on sentence. (apologies to Mrs. Adams, my 2nd grade math teacher) 


What
We Need & What You Get
What we Need: 
Startup
Operating Capital- for utilitites, rent, ingredients, and equipment. 
Funds for large kitchen appliances
food-safe work tables
food
safe metro shelving
small wares
cambro
food transport containers

You get: 
insight into the disturbed mind of a professional chef through my blog
A ringside seat in the creation and struggles of a young upstart company
You get to live vicariously through the twists and turns of my little adventure, so you don't have to.
And you can feel good knowing that you are helping this red-headed stepchild achieve his dream.


Other
Ways You Can Help
Money is always welcome.... but when that's not an option, there are many other ways you can help.... 
If you have an opinion about what I'm doing, or my plans, feel free to email me, as I look forward to hearing from you! 
If you have an old family recipe you'd like to share, perhaps I can revive it for you, and credit you or your family member as the source, if you like.
Also, it will help me a lot if you share
my story with your friends. 
You can email people on your contact lists, 
you can post my link on the wall of your facebook page, 
and you can also tweet that same link on your twitter account.

The more people we can have see this page, the quicker we work towards making the campaign goal a done deal.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>THE BENEFICIARIES</h3>
<h3>Elite Rescue, Recovery, and Rebuilding (ER3)</h3>
<p>was founded after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita as a full scale disatser relief organization. ER3 is based out of Philadelphia, PA. In all non-emergent times, ER3 works with community partners around the U.S. and around the world in the areas of education, health, and arts. Their involvement in Haiti has been constant since the January 12,2010 earthquake. They are currently working with the advancement of arts, as well as health and education with the Children's Home of Gonaives in Gonaives, Haiti.</p>
<h3>The Childrens Home of Gonaive (CHG)</h3>
<p>The Children’s Home of Gonaives is in need of financial assistance to care for our orphans. Our most immediate need is for nutritious food to give to the children, since the orphanage has not yet received food rations. The orphanage would be greatly appreciative of any support in helping our children lead healthy, fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>The Children’s Home of Gonaives is an orphanage located in Gonaives, Haiti. The orphanage is currently housing and helping 15 children. The city of Gonaives was affected by Cyclone Hanna which hit Haiti in 2008. On January 12th, 2010, Haiti experienced a devastating earthquake which claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. Fortunately, the orphans and the staff of the Children’s Home of Gonaive’s were unharmed. Two weeks after the earthquake, the Children’s Home of Gonaives took in several more children who had lost their parents in the tragedy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>Your donations would enable CHG to make their monthly budget for food, clothing, and the day to day needs for the children of CHG.</p>
<p>Your donations will also enable ER3 to continue their critical role of support in providing educational materials, school supplies, arts supplies, and internet service for educational resources.</p>
<p>This partnership was formed back in 2010 when Jim Stephens and Douglas Hogue of ER3 were working with Jeudy Djemson in Leogane, Haiti after the January 12 earthquake.</p>
</div>

<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
If you cannot contribute, please pass the word around to your friends or family who may be able to assist. Regretfully, no perks are available due to this urgent need. Thank You.</div></div>","THE BENEFICIARIES

CTGNE provides New England-based nonprofit organizations and charitable groups with an opportunity to promote their events, share their volunteer opportunities and connect to those who are interested in volunteering or supporting a particular cause. For volunteers, financial donors, or those who simply enjoy giving back to their communities, CTGNE is the gateway to finding volunteer opportunities, local charity news and potential job opportunities. 
CTGNE was founded in 2010 by Irene Johnson of Massachusetts. Its concept was born of her own desire to volunteer and her struggle to locate and learn about the volunteer opportunities and needs of her community.  
After weeks of research and thorough investigation, Irene created the CTGNE online database of nonprofit organizations and charitable groups in the New England area, created CTGNE's website, contacted several of these organizations and groups, informed them of her intended services and invited them to participate in her new venture, thus creating the CTGNE network. The reception was overwhelming.
Once the nonprofit organizations and charitable groups seeking volunteer staff or financial supporters made the commitment to work with CTGNE, CTGNE embarked on the second part of its mission; to inform potential volunteers on how to use the CTGNE network to find these organizations and groups. Through CTGNE’s website and social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, CTGNE, in such a short period of time, has become very successful at establishing itself as a powerful resource of information to hundreds of potential volunteers.
CTGNE is a free service that is offered to nonprofit organizations, charitable groups and to those who enjoy giving back to their community whether through volunteering or financial support.  When nonprofit organizations and charitable groups join Commit to Give – New England, they are granted permission to share their events and/or volunteer opportunities through CTGNE's social media channels.

</div></div>","ReforestNation is a new project that aims to buy and replace monoculture plantation woodlands and poor quality grazing land with healthy deciduous forests in Southern Scotland – and help build community in the process.
We want our project to be both environmentally and economically sustainable, so we aim to make and sell great products from Sitka woods – such as cabins, saunas and sheds – and use the funding we generate to fund reforestation, creating both healthy wild woods for plants and animals, and woods that benefit humans through woodland education and craft programs, hutting communities, and forest gardens.


We have a talented team of people with the rights skills and experience to take the project forward – people with experience of reforesting, permaculture, green wood work, crafts, community education – all with a passion for the ideas behind the project. To find out more about who we are, click here.
What We Need & What You Get
 In the first phase of the project, we want to raise a small sum through crowd-funding to kickstart the project. Now £4000 isn't going to buy any land for the project, but it will be enough to start a tree nursery and to invest in essential tools and equipment. 


Our biggest single investment is going to be in a mobile saw-mill - which might seem a strange way for a reforesting project to start! The mobile saw-mill is going to allow us to harvest and cut sitka trees and turn the wood into useful building materials to make saunas and cabins, which can then be sold to raise money for the project to invest in land to reforest.  
If the crowdfunding project goes well we hope to build our first prototype wood powered sauna over the winter - and this first sauna is a perk you can bid for in this campaign!



Flexible Funding 
With Indiegogo you can choose whether to have a fixed target for funding, where you only get the funding if you hit the target, or a flexible target, where you get to keep whatever your raise. We've opted for this option so that we can get started on the project however much we raise. If we miss our goal by a lot, we won't be able to buy the saw-mill - but we will put the funding straight into essential tools and materials for the tree nursery, and borrow or hire a saw-mill to be able to build the prototype saunas. 
The Impact
Whilst planting more trees and creating decidious forests is one of the key aims of this project, we think Reforestnation can offer something even more inspiring.
We are hoping to create a model that shows that a group of people with a passion can generate the funding to buy and reforest land themselves - without relying ongrants or funding from Goverment or charities. It's about turning people power into community woodland. 



In that sense, we are at the very beginning of an exciting experiement experiment, and we hope you'll get involved. We'll be documenting the whole experience through in film and photography, and through the Reforestnation website. 
  Risks & Challenges This is an experiment in community building that is built around a positive vision of what we can do if we pool our resources. We have a great team of people with diverse skills to get the project started, and if we raise the funding for the first phase of the project, we certainly have all the right experience and skills to create our first tree nursery and to build the first cabin and sauna prototypes.


What comes after that is a much bigger challenge. Raising enough money to buy land for the project is going to take a lot more funding, and another crowdfunding campaign. But by then we aim to have some pretty exciting things to offer people who support us - and a lot of new supporters like you to help spread the word.

  Other Ways You Can Help As we said above, ReforestNation aims to turn people power into trees. We hope you'll support us in any way you can - spread the word about the project, follow us on Twitter or Facebook, and share our crowdfunding campaign with your friends. 
Once the project gets going, we're also going to holding lots of community events, including seed collection and tree planting, stay tuned to our website and Facebook page for more information.

<p><b>What
We Do:</b></p>
<p>Community Technology Alliance (CTA) is an award winning Silicon Valley nonprofit creating 21<sup>st</sup> Century solutions to
poverty and homelessness by providing technology as well as
technical training and support to nonprofits, public agencies and
community organizations. CTA’s technology tools and services help our
partners save time and money that is redirected into providing housing and
stabilization services to people in need. CTA builds the capacity of human
services agencies to engage in data-driven strategic planning and measure their
collective impact.</p>
<p><b>CTA's Impact: </b></p>

of those years without a home. When sleeping on the streets, he says “all you

our partners prioritize sick and vulnerable individuals, like Warren, for access
to housing and other resources. CTA is proud to report that as a result of our
data analysis that moved him to the top of the priority list, Warren has been
housed for 2 years and has been able to take positive steps towards improving
his health and well-being.</p>
<p>CTA’s mission is to harness technologies to empower communities to develop data-driven
solutions to poverty and homelessness for people like Warren. In 2013, 78,745 men, women, and children visited one of
CTA’s partners seeking shelter, food, clothing, healthcare or employment
support. We know the exact count because CTA helps communities administer their
Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), a shared client database that is
used to connect homeless and extremely low-income households to resources to
find sustainable jobs, feed their families, and move into stable and secure
homes. Data collected in HMIS is also used by communities to develop
data-driven strategies for improving services as we work toward an end to
homelessness and poverty.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Shae and a I’m a 26 year old living in Atlanta, though I’m originally from all over asI’m a military brat. One of the things that I like most about the city of Atlanta is the culture; it is full of people of all kinds from all walks of life. As a nerd, living somewhere where I am able to find places toplay tabletop RPG’s, Warhammer 40,000, Magic the Gathering and the like is a godsend. But in order to continue to do the things that I love in the city I love, I must remain free, without the constant fear of at a moment’s notice being carted off to jail because of a series of unfortunate events.</p>
<p>          I've found myself in a situation where I am unable to pay the fines that have snowballed from the original broken head light incident, and this has resulted in a bench warrant for my arrest. The bench warrant makes it near impossible for me to find work in order to pay off the fines, leaving my only real remaining option as serving jail time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>           </p>
<p>         This is why I need your help. I have always attempted to live my life by the “Do unto others. . .” motto and I am reaching out now in the hopes that others who believe similarly might be willing to offer me a bit of kindness in my time of need. I need to raise $4000 dollars for the payment of legal fines, taxes, and of course a shiny new working headlight to replace the one that got me in all this trouble in the first place. Even if I don’t manage to make the entire goal, what I do get will go towards legal counsel to possibly reduce the amount of time I would have to spend in jail.</p>
<p>        While we have seen many campaigns like this one on indiegogo my hope is that this is one of the ones that stands out for the amount of time and effort put into it. Furthermore any extra money will not just go to waste, but be used in future Dudes Saving Dudes projects, paying it forward and spreading goodwill one dude in need at a time.</p>
<p>         We know that monetarily supporting this project isn’t for everyone and that’s ok! Spreading the word is a great way to support the project so liking or sharing this on Facebook, Tumblr, or Twitter as dudessavingdudes is greatly appreciated! Thank you for all your support!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
DeKalb County Community Gardens, in partnership with the Live Healthy DeKalb County  Initiative, has been building raised-bed gardens for local use since spring last year. Last growing season we raised and donated to local food pantries and community meal centers over 1.5 tons of food. Our county has 1 in 5 children living with food insecurity. This year we are expanding our organic gardens to a total of 35 different sites, and nearly 10 acres of growing space, we hope to close the food gap and prevent food deserts in all of DeKalb County Illinois. </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Materials to make 20 or more raised-bed gardens ($75 each) These gardens will be located at the Annie Glidden DeKalb County Outreach Campus in DeKalb County Illinois. These gardens will provide an intergenerational and inter-cultural opportunity. The campus gardens will benefit WIC Program participants, senior citizens living independently as well as nursing home residents. Also nearby residents who are part of a residential center will be able to help grow and share in the vegetables.</p>
Your donations will help us create these gardens for the community in order to give people free access to organic produce.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Our raised bed gardens are maintained by volunteers in the community and produce not taken by community members is donated to local food pantries.  Just last year, we donated over two thousand pounds of produce. <br/><br/>For more info, please check out our site: <a href=""http://dekalbgardens.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://dekalbgardens.org/</a>

It's the best gift I could think of getting.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I'm involved in lots of community things, as ya'll know, and one that I am super proud of and excited about is being a founding board member and volunteer staff for Connect &amp; Breathe. <strong>Connect &amp; Breathe is a ground-breaking and taboo-breaking nonjudgmental after-abortion talkline</strong> based out of the Rochester area and serving the entire U.S. Our vision is to live in a world where the shame and stigma of abortion is lifted and every person's experience with abortion is treated with dignity and respect. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Will you make a gift to Connect and Breathe in my honor today? Every gift helps us do amazing work.</strong></p>
<h2>What is Connect &amp; Breathe?</h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Connect &amp; Breathe is a nonjudgmental after-abortion talkline inspired by the work of a similar organization on the West Coast, Exhale, and by the need for UNbiased after-abortion services. There are hundreds of so-called crisis pregancy centers and hotlines and programs for women who have had abortions that are funded by conservative religious groups. <strong>Connect &amp; Breathe is one of just a handful of organizations in the U.S. that truly offer unbiased after-abortion care. We are neither pro-choice or pro-life and we affirm people of all (or no) religious backgrounds.</strong> We believe abortion is a personal experience that needs to be lifted out of the political and talked about as a real, human experience.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>1 in 3 women in the U.S. will have an abortion by the age of 45</strong>, yet no one talks about it. We aim to break this silence and give all people a safe, supportive, and confidential place to talk frankly about abortion.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Since our phones went live in 2011, we've taken over <strong>400 calls</strong> from all over the U.S. (and a handful from abroad), which are answered by one of the <strong>30 volunteers</strong> we have trained over the past 2 years. We talk to callers who mainly feel relief, who are deeply greived, who had an abortion days ago and who had an abortion years ago. What we offer is a listening and supportive ear that will not judge or condescend, a friendly voice that will affirm each experience and emotion as valid and important.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Connect &amp; Breathe?</strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">As a small non-profit, just rounding out our second year, <strong>we are in a critical time for the success of a nonprofit org</strong>. We are very lean--<strong>all volunteer</strong> staff and board. We depend entirely on grants and individual donations to keep our little operation moving and growing. We use our resources wisely and we are doing incredibly powerful work on a shoestring budget. A generous gift in any amount will be put to great use. <strong>Our primary expenses are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Printing and distribution of marketing materials to health providers and community orgs across the U.S., which we currently provide free-of-cost to abortion providers,</li>
<li>Training costs for the 30-hour training we provide twice a year for talkline volunteers.</li>
<li>Exhibition costs at reproductive health conferences across the U.S. to get the word out to providers about our services, and</li>
<li>Talkline and office expenses--the nitty gritty stuff like phones, letterhead, and other operational costs..</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>It's been a blessed experience being on the frontlines of this organization, seeing it move from an inspired idea to an incorporated nonprofit organization to a growing and successful talkline. We rely on individual donations to keep our phones on and to expand our reach.</strong></p>
<h2>Connect &amp; Breathe sounds awesome! How else can I help?</h2>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Become a talkline volunteer</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We have a training coming up in April for new talkline volunteers. It is a rigorous training and experience, but you don't need any special degree or background to help. Our training is designed to help you do some deep self-learning and self-care around abortion that will prepare you for the volunteer role and help you figure out if it is a good fit for your skill set. If you are interested, give me a shout at <a href=""mailto:kaelyn@connectandbreathe.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">kaelyn@connectandbreathe.org</a>. Yep, I'm the volunteer manager, too.

<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Apply to join the board of directors</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We are also currently seeking new board members to join our very kitchen-table-grassroots and small board.

Since our phones went live in 2011, we've taken over 400 calls from all over the U.S. (and a handful from abroad), which are answered by one of the 30 volunteers we have trained over the past 2 years. We talk to callers who mainly feel relief, who are deeply greived, who had an abortion days ago and who had an abortion years ago. What we offer is a listening and supportive ear that will not judge or condescend, a friendly voice that will affirm each experience and emotion as valid and important.
Why Connect & Breathe?
As a small non-profit, just rounding out our second year, we are in a critical time for the success of a nonprofit org. We are very lean--all volunteer staff and board. We depend entirely on grants and individual donations to keep our little operation moving and growing. We use our resources wisely and we are doing incredibly powerful work on a shoestring budget. A generous gift in any amount will be put to great use. Our primary expenses are:

Printing and distribution of marketing materials to health providers and community orgs across the U.S., which we currently provide free-of-cost to abortion providers,
Training costs for the 30-hour training we provide twice a year for talkline volunteers.
Exhibition costs at reproductive health conferences across the U.S. to get the word out to providers about our services, and
Talkline and office expenses--the nitty gritty stuff like phones, letterhead, and other operational costs..
It's been a blessed experience being on the frontlines of this organization, seeing it move from an inspired idea to an incorporated nonprofit organization to a growing and successful talkline. We rely on individual donations to keep our phones on and to expand our reach.
Connect & Breathe sounds awesome! How else can I help?
Become a talkline volunteer
We have a training coming up in April for new talkline volunteers. It is a rigorous training and experience, but you don't need any special degree or background to help. Our training is designed to help you do some deep self-learning and self-care around abortion that will prepare you for the volunteer role and help you figure out if it is a good fit for your skill set. If you are interested, give me a shout at kaelyn@connectandbreathe.org. Yep, I'm the volunteer manager, too. We really are all volunteer. That's how we roll!
Donate your skills
If you want to donate other skills you may have such as web design or fundraising skills, we'd love to talk more about that, too!
Apply to join the board of directors
We are also currently seeking new board members to join our very kitchen-table-grassroots and small board. You can get in touch with me at kaelyn@connectandbreathe.org if this sounds like your jam.

Our Story


On March 31, 2012, GNEP looks forward to its 5th annual ""Sista-2-Sista Youth Summit,"" a one-day summit that empowers 125 young high school women of color from New York City to tap into their full potential by letting go of their stories of the past and embracing NOW.  The summit will engage the participants in panel discussions, workshops, live entertainment, and reflective activities. 

This year's theme is Unraveling Stories, Creating New Possibilities.  GNEP believes that everyone has a story about their past; however it is the interpretation of these stories that often stops people from tapping into their full potential or giving 100% of themselves in any given situation.  We will aid the young women in overcoming some barriers of the past, and in creating new and empowering stories about their present and their future.   




The Impact


Through mentorship programs and annual youth summits, GNEP utilizes a three step process of self awareness, self appreciation and self actualization that empowers youth to make well informed decisions about NOW and their futures. 

Upon completion of the Summit, the participants will be provided with access to resources in the areas of personal and professional development; will be affirmed that they can be whatever they choose to be; will continue to foster an appreciation for sisterhood; will develop skills to think critically and engage in healthy debate while unraveling the stories from the past that hinder them from reaching their full potential; and they will be inspired to take action in the areas of their life that matter most.

<p><b>The Cupcake Delight Beginnings</b></p>
<p>  My name is Peggy Headings and I grew up in the state of Maine where food was everywhere. Homemade cakes, cookies, donuts, whoopie pies, breads, cupcakes ect.. When I was a child my mom would make chocolate whoopie pies and my cousin would always get the first one and you got it... it was still hot! It will melt and make a mess but she loved it every time. One of my all time favorites are chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting!  Every child should be able to enjoy great tasting desserts and I want to provide them!</p>
<p>   I wanted to find a way to open up a bakery years ago but we couldn't due to having to look after our children and one with a disability called Dystonia. We went through a long 14 years of hoping and praying for our son to get better. Traveled 5 hours to Little Rock for tests and more tests til they found out what my son had. Then two years ago we heard about DBS surgery. I remember how terrified I was to see the day that my son would get his head drilled into. But Thank God, It's over and he now can walk around like you and I!</p>
<p>  Now it's a new beginning. A new beginning starting with my long ago dream taking flight!  I developed a love for baking from a young age and went to Reign 3 in high school for baking and I have worked at Wal-marts bakeries. I have decorated Wedding cakes, Anniversary Cakes, Birthday Cakes, cupcakes and all kinds of different desserts and breads for years in my own home. Many people have asked me if I made cakes to sell when they see my creations. </p>
<p>  I want to create some Gluten Free product as well as diabetic products along with the regular desserts. How about stopping in for a nice, big cinnamon roll! Yummy!  I believe all people should be able to enjoy a good dessert. It should also be available to the diabetics and those allergic to gluten!  I hear it often.. A lady with a small child has come by the bakery where I worked and the child asked, ""Mommy, can we have one please?"" and the mom said, ""No, you we can't have any of those desserts because it isn't gluten free."" </p>
<p>  Opening up a Bakery has been a life long dream. A dream that can come true with your help. I want to create a better place for our children and our community. We may be making this a Bakery/pizza shop for all to enjoy. What child doesn't like pizza? Pizza that you can buy hot or ready to take home and bake in your own oven. </p>
<p> I also want to add different fun things to do for the children in our community. Let's play some Trivia children! They will win a delicious dessert for their reward!  Let's not forget our Police Officers and Fire Fighters. They will be able to come in once a week for a FREE coffee and dessert! <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">What a bunch of yummy treats that will be available when we open our Bakery to our community!</span></p>

We believe in getting children to interact together. Of course there will be breads of all shapes and sizes, but there will also be donuts, delicious pies, seasonal cakes, and drinks. The food will be served with soda, hot chocolate, or coffee, to enhance the atmosphere. And, like any bakery shop, you can also take just a single treat to go if you please.</p>

<p>  I have found a building that would work for our bakery! It is for sale and they are asking $96,000.

<p><b>Where You Come In</b></p>
<p> We could really use some help. I can't afford to purchase this building or get the equipment and supplies needed. What money I do receive will go for the bakery.

</p><p>Hello All!</p>
<p>My name is Ryan Green and I
am a sophomore at the University of Washington. This summer I have the
opportunity of a lifetime, but I need your help to be able to participate. At
my university, I am a member of the fraternity Pi Kappa Phi. One of the main reasons
that I decided to join Pi Kappa Phi was the opportunity as a member to participate
in a cross-country bicycle ride put on by Pi Kappa Phi’s national philanthropy,
Push America. Push America is a non-profit organization that works towards
bettering the lives of people with mental and physical disabilities through
their three main areas of focus: disability awareness, volunteerism, and
fundraising. I am here to help my fundraising efforts for the trip, but let me
tell you about the trip itself first so you have a better idea of why I need
your help.</p>
<p>So here’s how the Journey of
Hope works. There are three different routes, the North Route, the Trans
American Route, and the South Route. I have been given the privilege to ride on
the South Route this summer, starting from Long Beach, California and ending in
Washington D.C. two months later. Each route varies in length by a few days,
but we will all complete this journey together on the same day, arriving on the
Capitol lawn simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Journey of Hope is about
much more than the cycling. In each city that we stop at along the way, we will
participate in events called friendship visits, where we will spend time with
people with all kinds of disabilities. These events include things like dances,
baseball, wheelchair basketball, and many more things. All of these events have
an overall goal, and that is to bring joy and smiles to the people that we will
be interacting with, while teaching people to live practicing empathy rather
than sympathy. These towns wait for us all year to arrive and I want to help
deliver the joy and experience that they have been waiting for since last
summer.</p>
<p>Friendship visits are the way
the Journey of Hope teams will demonstrate Push Americas ideals of volunteerism
and disability awareness. We deliver volunteerism by taking out time to spend
time with these people across the nation that have been waiting all year for
our arrival. Disability awareness also is displayed here because the teams and
the community learn to practice empathy rather than sympathy.</p>
<p><b>Now this is why I have come to you for help. </b>The last area of focus for Push America is
fundraising. In order for each rider to participate in the Journey of Hope, he
must raise a minimum of $5,500 for Push America. The money that is raised is
then distributed by Push America to local organizations across the United
States that work for helping better the lives of people with mental and
physical disabilities. I have currently raised just over $3,000 with the
fundraising deadline approaching just a couple of months away. Your
contribution could be the deciding factor that will allow me to participate in
this once in a lifetime opportunity. <b>Even
if you are unable to donate, even sharing this page to help spread the word
about me and my efforts is something that I will be eternally thankful for.</b></p>
<p>Here is my promise to you if
you chose to support me. I promise that I will expel all of my efforts
throughout the entire summer. I will always put my heart into both the cycling
and the time that I will spend bettering the lives of people across the
country. I will make this summer the best experience for the people that I meet
because this summer is not about me, it is about the people that we interact
with and the happiness and service that we will bring to them.</p>

support.<br/></p><p>Ryan Green<br/></p></div>","Hello All!

Since arriving in New Orleans we have begun crafting stories of a different nature, stories that matter and serve a larger purpose than simply making a profit.<br/></p><p>With are newfound passion for video and the ambition to do something that matters, we plan to mesh both together by traveling to Kenya with Mama Maji.

 Maji then <i>produce a promo video for them.</i> They have assisted in the 
creation of a water kiosk before, but never have had anyone along the 
journey to share the story before.  <br/></p><p></p><p> - <b>2nd.</b> We will also gather media for a piece about the experience, the 
people, the land, the culture.  Sewing it all together to make a <i>slice 
of life piece</i> from the month of exploring. </p> - <b>3rd.</b> Will be a piece Colleen is spearheading involving <i>women retelling 
the story of women </i>from all over the world. This will be a long-term 
project, but the chance to add footage to it from this experience will 
be priceless.<p></p><p>We will joyfully be able to put our combined background in commercial and narrative video to good use, as well our audio and camera gear.</p><p>*** All we need is airfare there and back, and the rest is taken care of.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>In Short:<br/>

Sean works on feature films & commercials, and Colleen works full time at a local night time art market as well as part time with Mama Maji. Together we have years of experience in the commercial market and have crafted many stories. Since arriving in New Orleans we have begun crafting stories of a different nature, stories that matter and serve a larger purpose than simply making a profit.With are newfound passion for video and the ambition to do something that matters, we plan to mesh both together by traveling to Kenya with Mama Maji. Our goal is to document the creation of a water kiosk, the culture, and most importantly the untold stories of the women in the  small community of Kamrongo, Kenya.What is our project?While Mama Maji is working on funding for the creation of the water kiosk, we are working on funding for the training of the women, and the launching of our career paths. The current goal of this project is for August, 2014. We plan on creating 3 videos from this trip: - 1st. We'll document the water kiosk construction for the non-profit Mama
 Maji then produce a promo video for them. They have assisted in the 
creation of a water kiosk before, but never have had anyone along the 
journey to share the story before.   - 2nd. We will also gather media for a piece about the experience, the 
people, the land, the culture.  Sewing it all together to make a slice 
of life piece from the month of exploring.  - 3rd. Will be a piece Colleen is spearheading involving women retelling 
the story of women from all over the world. This will be a long-term 
project, but the chance to add footage to it from this experience will 
be priceless.We will joyfully be able to put our combined background in commercial and narrative video to good use, as well our audio and camera gear.*** All we need is airfare there and back, and the rest is taken care of.In Short:
We need YOUR help. A little bit goes a long way. Please donate what you can and share with those you think would be interested.Your donations will directly benefit:To support Mama Maji's success in future fundraising for water projects. A good video showing what 
your non-profit does helps raise funding significantly. The training of 22 women to run, operate, and maintain the water kiosk for their community. And this is just the beginning . . . . Imagine what can happen if hundreds of women have more time, support, and resources to build their dreams. Empower a women and you empower the community. Also you are helping us reach our goals of working in a career that positively gives back to the world around us. After 
this trip, our credentials and hands on experience will give us a jump start into our career 
journey.  Water is a women’s issue.
We believe that through connecting women in a common effort of 
change, addressing the biggest challenge to women globally, we can shift
 the world.
So long as there are women whose lives and voices are limited by their circumstances, no woman can remain silent.
And water is the first step.  - Mama Maji

<h3><u> Understanding The Basics</u></h3> <p></p>
<p><b>TheUnJunk.com</b> is an ambitious website project that
wants to break the modern Print/TV and Online barriers. The modern media is
awesome, always sprinting for the breaking stuff, and this really helps us (<u>the
general population</u>) all around the globe to sit back and <b>think/curse/criticise/follow </b>the trends.
However, if Television is great, the web is a step ahead. The www is the
driving force for almost all of us and more than the logical information, it’s
the ‘Staying Connected’ phenomenon we value the most. The basics for Television
revolve around TRP/RATINGS and to achieve this, our standard TV shows, dramas,
talent shows, reality shows and even the NEWS follow norms, we find hard to
accept. We mean, how many times have you sat down thinking, this isn’t the
right way to do things, this isn’t what the news should be like and this isn’t
reality, this is all <b>made-up/scripted/untrue/JUNK</b>.
You’ll most certainly agree, the electronic stuff is highly monopolised.</p>
<p>The web has its own problems. We constantly read <b>posts/blogs/comments</b> or watch <b>videos/photos</b> that are legit, that are
relevant, that are educational, and that are ignored and then <b>banned/censored/removed</b>. Politics,
Humanity, Animal Cruelty, Truth, Discriminations against Women, Our Skin Colour,
Our Religion, Our Sex or Our Castes are the most affected and targeted topics
that most of the times are banned/censored or removed on the name of ‘nudity,
hate, violence, spam and harm.’ With the <b><span>TheUnJunk.com </span></b>Project, we aspire to create <u>one-of-a-kind</u>
worldwide community that is Funded by YOU, Sourced by YOU and even Run by
YOU, where there’s no unnecessary restrictions on sharing your links,
posts, videos and photos, where there’s no unnecessary bans, where we wish to
serve the better web content to the likeminded people who support an open,
unbiased web for all. We want to make this the largest crowd based media/social
community that doesn’t follow the normal routine, where the modern JUNK that we
all are served is <b>UnJunked</b>.</p>

<u>How, What &amp; Why?</u><br/>
</h3>
<div>
<p>Undoubtedly<b>, </b>crowd
funding is the smartest and the easiest way for a start-up with coherent ideas
to move ahead and create trust from the very beginning. We not only want to
create the biggest and the largest crowd run online community that supports truth
with proper information flow, but more importantly, an impartial community that
loves humanity on the whole. Yes, bans and censors are important, but you need
to be fair.</p>
<p>We don’t say the world
needs another social networking platform, but there’s always room for change and
we want to change this with our own social community where everyone hears and
everyone shares. We are the ones who make the news and it should be us who
deliver them as it is, unbiased and straightforward. We are the ones who trend
things and it would be awe-inspiring if we made them perfect. We all join
forums, we comment, we spread the word, but we still have so many things we
wish we could <b>say/speak/write</b> our
own way. There is a strong need for an open/free web that breaks away from the
obvious and isn’t chained by some modern world web villains.</p>

We LOVE the world around us and the people living in that world. However, there

wild to reach new places and new people. We want to bring the social sharing
and social publishing abilities back into the game. The success requires Crowd
Funding, Crowd Sourcing and Crowd Support. We want everybody to take a
collective, more responsible approach on sharing information on the web. It is

<p></p></div>","Summary
The Grove, Dallas
is a collaborative coworking community in the Historic West End of
Downtown Dallas, Texas.  Our passion is to build a community of
entrepreneurs, freelancers, non­profits and change agents passionate about
transforming our city for the good.  Our first location in New Haven,
Connecticut has led the charge in revitalizing their city for the last 4
years, and we intend to do the same for Dallas.
The ImpactWe've grown from 6 members in September 2013, to over 60 organizations and businesses creating of a diverse community of freelancers, researchers, technology developers, non-profits and creatives.                   We've already partnered with the Dallas chapter of The United Way in training the non­profits enrolled in their GroundFloor program in social media strategies for non­profits like Accion TX and Cafe Momentum.  We are working with Downtown Dallas Inc in their mission for revitalizing the Downtown community.Our sister location in New Haven successfully raised $20,000 in their first expansion campaign which exponentially increased their ability to achieve their mission.  Since then, they have grown to become a strong voice for economic development and social transformation in their city.  It is on this model that we are growing this Dallas movement.
We believe business can be used for good

We believe
a city-wide transformation is possible through collaboration and resource
sharing

We believe we are stronger together than we are alone

This campaign will allow us to triple the impact that we have already had on revitalization and social mission in Dallas.

What We Need
We've done our best
to remain frugal while also making sure that our space is top notch when
it comes to design and giving people the tools they need to efficiently
grow their businesses and organizations.  Here is the general
overview of our expenses for this expansion.  

Furniture (we are partnering with a local furniture dealer
     to make sure we get the best value for our money):  $22,490
      
Hospitality (includes trash cans, dishes, coffee brewers,
     etc.): $4,920 
Electronics (includes additional Ruckus access
     points and controller for our wifi, and additional sound system
     components):  $7,700
Interior Design (includes new signage, décor, etc.):
      $3,850  

Miscellaneous (includes gallery lighting, step stools,
     delivery cart, etc.):  $1,040  

We don't anticipate
falling short of our goal, simply because of the amazing community that we
have behind this campaign.  But, should that take place, we will
still use the funds committed for the items above.  We might have to
sacrifice the additional coffee maker, or the delivery cart, but we'll
adjust to make sure we have everything we need to make our space amazing.
Risks & Challenges
Every dollar
we get will be used to furnish The Grove Dallas.  If we are unable to
achieve our goal we may not be able to keep our prices as low and some
entrepreneurs' dreams may not be fulfilled.
Our challenges are similar to other small businesses - the
difference is we serve the community.  Without continued support and
involvement from the community we will find it increasingly difficult to
achieve our ultimate mission.
Other Ways You Can
Help
We realize that not
everybody can contribute financially to our campaign, but there are still
ways for you to help. 
You can help by
simply letting people know about the campaign. Conversations about the
coworking movement and social change are great ways to get the word out.

<i>""Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen - </i><i>to provide the poor wanderer with shelter. If you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry...then your light will rise in the darkness and your night will become like noonday...H</i><i>e will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land, and will strengthen our frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, </i><i style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">like a spring whose waters never fail...I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land..."" Isaiah 58</i>
</blockquote><p>Our goal is to create a simple 1-2-3 method of online fundraising for any valid Charity. For our IndieGogo launch we have chosen one of our favorite charities to get a share of your contributions - For His Children, Ecuador. </p><p>Charities are always in need of funding, to go on accomplishing their noble works. When things get tight, they need ever more activities just to survive. Our mission is to give any charity a ready-made means of fundraising online. Using chocolates, that all-time favorite, CforC can provide any charity with an easy fundraising method using artisan chocolate.</p><p>Back in the days when monks were forming their communities and missions, they knew that they needed some form of income, an understanding born of the sheer survival needs of the ancient world. They grew grapes and produced artisan wines. In today's world, non-profits still need funding to survive. CforC's purpose is to help by making artisan chocolates available to incentivize contributions. </p><p>The web is infinitely suitable to reach the multitudes who can help our charities, and we have created a Prototype site that awaits your contributions to launch, at <a href=""http://www.chocolateforcharity.net./"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ChocolateForCharity.net.</a></p><p><i>This is a Non-Profit/For-Profit partnership. The mission of CforC is to partner with charities to put them in the virtual chocolate business. The business structure is simple - to distribute 50% of gross profits to any charity. Chocolate Tasting fundraising events, and individual promotions by volunteers and staff, can create an income stream that will support the crucial good works of the charity.</i></p><blockquote><i>Founder's Comment: ""The ideals of a clean environment always drove my career choices, and I've worked many years to preserve sensitive land and clean up pollution in groundwater. Now, I feel called to help raise money for humanitarian work, especially for orphan car. In past years I toured refugee camps in Yugoslavia with Operation Mobilization; went to China as an educator with Educational Resources &amp; Referrals China; and recently worked in Ecuador with For His Children orphan care ministry. This transforming experience now drives my calling to help those in charitable work, in a big way!""</i></blockquote><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>During this IndieGogo launch we will begin our charity-share venture with one orphan-care charity - For His Children. We chose FHC because they are a small childrens' charity in regular need of funding. CforC founders have personally visited and seen their work on the ground, and it is clear they can grow to do so much more good for children with critical needs, if they only develop a more regular source of income. You can read more at <a href=""www.forhischildren-ecuador.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.forhischildren-ecuador.org</a> or watch our video above to learn more.</p><p>This IndieGogo launch is structured to raise $12,500 for ForHisChildren, while at the same time raising $12,500 toward the development of CforC. Your contribution will not only start the ChocolateForCharity fundraising model, you will immediately contribute to a significant children's ministry. This is a <i>Non-Profit / For-Profit partnership</i> at its best. </p><p>The CforC website is a social enterprise with the capacity for universal impact, since it will be used by any charity in any charitable work. Your contribution will immediately benefit the children of FHC, will help in startup of CforC, and you yourself will get the delights of artisan chocolates grown right in Ecuador, where FHC is based! If you choose, you can have your chocolate perks sent as a present to a friend, family or business associate.</p><blockquote><i>Your perks are the same chocolates to be offered through ChocolateForCharity, produced by artisan chocolatiers right here in the USA, from single-source cocoa grown right in the area of ForHisChildren in Ecuador. Artisan brands are always unique in flavor, and the select chocolates are 100% pure in materials, using only chocolate, cocoa butter and organic ingredients like blueberries and almonds. The new interest in artisan chocolate (like craft beer, craft wine, or craft cheese) is a move towards a more pure, more nutritious, and more memorable product. </i></blockquote><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Your Contribution</span><br/></p><p>You may contribute from $20 to $1,000 or more. If you want simply to start at $20, we will declare your involvement, or send your Valentine love, on the new ChocolateForCharity site. We'll post your personalized message, and your contribution will be split 50/50 between FHC and CforC.</p><p>Contribute $40 and you'll receive two cinnamon hot cocoa sticks, that melt into hot milk or coffee for a heart-warming winter treat. Healthful ingredients are only the purest: organic cocoa beans, evaporated cane juice, cocoa powder, and organic Saigon cinnamon. You will be contributing $12 to CforC and $12 to FHC after chocolate costs and S&amp;H. For a $75 contribution you'll receive a Winter Season Sampler containing a variety including a jar of pure cocoa powder (a delight in anyone's kitchen) pure 67% Chocolate Bar, Celtic Sea Salt 67% Chocolate Bar, and a Michigan Cherry 77% Chocolate Bar. Distribution after S&amp;H will be $22 to FHC and $22 to CforC. A $200 contribution will get you two packages of specially-prepared tasting samplers, in packs of 100 samplers each - 200 tastings total. These special samplers are generally prepared just for wine tastings, and are not available commercially. You will have your choice of flavors, all in organic flavorings of Celtic Sea Salt, Michigan Cherry, Pure 67%, Michigan Blueberry, Pure 77%, Almond, Espresso. Distribution after costs will be $64 FHC/$64 CforC. </p><p>At $1,000 you will receive four specially-assembled valentine gift packages of artisan chocolates, one for each of your favorite people. They include the Winter Sampler noted above, and can be sent one to Grandma, one to the love of your life, one to your daughter and so on. Your contribution will contribute $408 each to FHC and $408 to CforC development.</p><p>These perks are all healthy for you and new studies appear each day to confirm the healthful aspects of dark chocolate (see prototype website <a href=""http://www.chocolateforcharity.net%29/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ChocolateForCharity.net)</a>. Your perks are great as gifts to anyone important to your life - friend, family or business associate. You won't find these specially-assembled gifts anywhere on-the-shelf, so they make a completely unique present to yourself or others! You will feel good about your contribution, and the good feeling will live on in your chocolate supply.</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote>
<i>After the cost of chocolates, S&amp;H and Indie Fee, the returns from your contribution will be distributed 50/50 to FHC and to CforC for development costs. You will have the satisfaction of helping both FHC children and CforC in significant ways. <br/></i><i>We hope you'll be generous to the cause of For His Children, and at the same time to the startup of ChocolateForCharity.net, an online method of producing funds for charitable causes using a totally democratic web interface. <i>CforC will apply your contribution to final development of the website and for promotion to other charities</i>.</i>
</blockquote><p></p><h3>Your Impact</h3><p>There are 1.6 million non-profits registered in the United States*, and every one of them needs money to achieve their vision.

CforC combines Profit with Non-Profit incentives, in a formula that works for all. People <u>will</u> buy chocolates no matter what, and CforC is a place where their purchases will make a real difference. Buy healthy chocolate here, and not only is your conscience clear about eating healthfully, but you are part of a global solution to suffering and injustices. Healthy chocolates, supplied online by tried-and-true charities, is a win-win-win formula for everyone. Whether the cause is hunger, a cancer cure, orphan-care, or less crime, the world will be a better place when our appetites drive us to fund the meaningful efforts already in place, but struggling for lack of funds.</p><p>Step up, and your aid in launching CforC will help a spectrum of charities to achieve their visions over time. This is a concept that is fully sustainable. This is a campaign that will take a million chocolate transactions going on today, and transform them into life-giving help for millions, tomorrow. </p><p>Our goal is to make one of the world's most common market transactions profitable for any charity that cares to reach out and take it.</p><blockquote><i>The founders of CforC have personally visited the For His Children orphanages, and seen their dedicated work up close and personal. Robert &amp; Fran have been involved in fundraising one-to-one in the past, to finance many outreach missions over the years. They have personally give 2, 4 and 8 week blocks of their time participating hands-on in the charitable labors of others, including For His Children, Educational Resources and Referrals China, Living Waters International, Operation Mobilization and Extreme Response to name just a few.</i></blockquote><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Can't help with contributions just now? Just talk it up and tell others about the global potential of Chocolates for Charity. Tell them that this is a way that charities can get a new lift on life. CforC can make a difference, and so can you! Talk is not cheap; talk can be priceless!</p><blockquote>
<i>We know that sometimes you just can't help financially. Instead you can:</i><ul>
<li><i>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</i></li>
<li><i style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Make use of the Indiegogo share tools to tell a friend or family member!</i></li>

Just talk it up and tell others about the global potential of Chocolates for Charity. Tell them that this is a way that charities can get a new lift on life. CforC can make a difference, and so can you! Talk is not cheap; talk can be priceless!
We know that sometimes you just can't help financially. Instead you can:
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.
Make use of the Indiegogo share tools to tell a friend or family member!

We look forward to your support, and to sharing an experience that says that even just a few people can change the world if we only try!* http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/412674-The-Nonprofit-Sector-in-Brief.pdf",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 21px;"">To the hundreds of Maine Media Workshoppers—students and professors who worked with Guru Achary﻿ (whether it was for a week long course or for the several months he was in the Cinematography Track) and friends of Guru, he has changed all of us for the better as people and as filmmakers. Guru sadly passed on January 3rd, 2014. He fought the good fight until the very end. I know we all have been so upset for Guru, his wife Gabriela Fleitas﻿, their families (for what they have had to go through and in seeing their loved one in so much pain and sickness), and we have been upset for each other being so far apart during this sudden discovery of aggressive tumors on his brain and spine. Guru was one of the best people and most talented cinematographers we’ve ever met. I know that we have all felt somewhat helpless being spread across this giant world, which has been extremely difficult because we all got so close in Maine during those magical filmmaking months. It has been difficult to not be there physically for the people we love. I know Guru fought hard because he didn’t want to leave his new wife, his family and friends, or a burden of medical bills behind (whattaguy!)…I thought that this could be a good way to feel that each of us could contribute and show our support to his wife/family and at least help out in some physical way with medical/funeral bills no one should have to face--a form of support at least until we meet with people face to face again. Gabby has also been the most incredible devoted wife, spending all of her time taking care of her husband through this all. If we could all give just a little for medical bills and the funeral (at least to Gabby/his family if they will accept it), it would be a way of coming together and showing support for the people we love and cannot be physically there for right now--and to help out/show his family how much we all loved and respected him/could try to at least help a little in taking away one of the worries he feared leaving behind. Even if you can’t give anything (we’re all starving artists, I completely get that), don't feel bad at all, but please at least share this link and pass it all around, word of mouth is a form of support. It is a way of giving and helping everyone in Singapore/Gabby until we can bombard Gabs with hugs and kisses during the next opportunity. I picked a random fundraising goal, but hoping everyone can give a little (adding up quickly) and exceed expectations to help Gabs and their families at least a little bit. [The website also charges a percentage to be used]. We love these two so greatly, I thought this would be a beneficial way to come together and help for now. Cheers to Guru, we have all changed greatly having met this man, and (in different forms) he's always with us in life from here on out, whattaguy. ;) <br/></span></font>

<li>Manuel and I met when I was only 16. He had just entered college and we met through a mutual friend with whom I still spend much time. We began our adult lives learning together and growing together. We have encountered so many new things on the road to adulthood, love, loss, happiness, struggle, success, and so much more. We are finally nearing our 30's and he decided it was time to pop the question. Of course I said yes, I always knew I would. Along the road to where we are now we have both maintained full time schooling (him to become a doctor, and me to complete my BA and move on to grad school). </li>
<li>This campaign would help us to achieve our long time desire to get married and become a family. So close to finishing school we are both looking at facing the loans and hardship that will follow the exciting graduation. Along with success always comes a struggle to get there. To have a nice wedding ceremony and reception has always been my lifelong dream; along with many other girls I'm sure.</li>
<li>We have waited eight years to get to where we are now. Throughout that time we have solidified our relationship and desire to remain together. We are certain that will never change and are excited to start a new life together. This is the first step, raising the money to have our dream wedding would not only inspire more growth and love within our relationship, but it will also send us along the path to many other new beginnings and continued success along the way. We are deciding to hold this campaign not just to achieve our goal, but also because we desire to set a strong foundation for ourselves, one that is not accompanied by wedding debt and forever working to move forward from our past. Your contributions to this campaign would be so greatly appreciated, they would impact the lives of two people who desire to succeed and make changes in the lives of many many others.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>My fiancee and I have sat down and worked out a budget for a classy yet cheap and achievable wedding. In total the ceremony and reception along with all the trimmings would total about $9,100. That includes a venue for both ceremony and reception (including food, drinks, decorations, etc) would cost about $3,500. For a cake I have done some research and found creative ways to go cheap. Since we are going to have a very intimate affair only about 25 people this would cost about $150. The dress I have found is about $800. So, everything is coming at a very good price I love to google things and learn how to get the best deal for the money, so any donations would be well spent.</li>
<li>Even if we do not reach our goal, we will still put any donations toward the event, we will alter our wedding accordingly to what we can afford. All donations are helpful and even as little as $5 would add a new, exciting, and beautiful addition to our big day and would help to make the event all the more memorable and special for all who attend.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><ul>
<li>Even if you cannot make a direct contribution, any and all help will be greatly appreciated and accepted.

<h3><font color=""#66cc00"" size=""4"">Our Story - The Gift Card Loaded with Oakland Love!</font></h3>
<p>We love Oakland. We want jobs for Oaklanders.  We know that supporting local independent businesses and artists -- shopping independently -- keeps and creates local jobs. SO...we want to make it EASY and FUN to do.  This is why we're creating the Oakland Grown Gift Card.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The gift card that you can use at multiple locally-owned businesses. Get local coffee, clothes, housewares, jewelry, kids' stuff...eat at our awesome local restaurants.  Buy art from our amazing local artists... from one fabulous gift card.  <br/></p>
<p>Who are we? We are <a href=""http://oaklandgrown.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Oakland Grown"">Oakland Grown </a>- a group of passionate volunteers working to support our local economy by re-directing dollars into the local economy.  We are the product of two non-profit organizations: <a href=""http://omlf.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""OMLF - Oakland Merchants Leadership Forum"">Oakland Merchants Leadership Forum</a>, where we were born and raised, and the <a href=""http://sustainablebusinessalliance.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""SBA - Sustainable Business Alliance"">Sustainable Business Alliance</a>, who recently adopted us. Together, we are all working to build a strong, real economy that is healthy and equitable!  </p>

<h3><font color=""#66cc00"" size=""4"">The Impact: Stop Money from Leaving Oakland and Create More Jobs!</font></h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oaklandgrown.org/concrete/concrete/images/multiplier-caption.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just about everyone gives and receives gift cards.  For the past 4 years, gift cards were the most requested gifts for the holidays.  $23 billion is spent on gift cards during the holidays nationally, and almost all of it is to chain stores. (Boo!)  Local stores everywhere are almost completely absent from this market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On a per capita basis, that translates to Oaklanders sending more than <strong>$25 million right out of our neighborhoods each holiday season</strong> through gift card purchases.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Oakland Grown Gift Card will help change that. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soon, with your help, we'll be able to offer gift cards that everyone can buy and use with Oakland's coolest local independent businesses and artists, keeping money -- and jobs -- in our community.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Supporting local businesses supports not only retail jobs, but all kinds of other jobs</strong>, as our local businesses support other local business owners like graphic designers, accountants, artists, local newspapers, community banks and lots of other businesses and artists that chain stores would not be supporting because they get most of their work done at headquarters somewhere else.  See this idea illustrated in the graphic above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are lots of other positive impacts of re-directing this money...local independent businesses and artists</p>
<p>  &gt;&gt;  Give more of their revenue to local causes </p>
<p>  &gt;&gt;  Make our communities more interesting, unique and worth traveling to see</p>
<p>  &gt;&gt;  Carry items by local people and that support the interests of local people</p>
<p>  &gt;&gt;  Diversify our economy portfolio. When we have lots of small businesses, we are putting all of our jobs in </p>
<p>one place, eggs in one basket.  If we put all our jobs in one big fat store and that store folds or leaves town for a better deal, all of those jobs disappear at once. That's SCARY.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bare bones seed costs:</strong> </p>
<p>We are seeking $2500 to seed this project. We need about $7500 in total to get this program off the ground and in operation through the holidays.  We already raised $5000 in sponsorships and now need the final $2500. This will pay for the bare minimum expenses, no marketing budget, all-volunteer operation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our costs</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Start Up<strong> </strong></p>
<p>$5000 - custom local gift card program and software development</p>
<p>$500 - designing and setting up the cards</p>
<p>$800 - printing the cards</p>
<p>$250 - merchandizing tools</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>$6550  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monthly Fees for 3 Months</p>
<p>$100 program vendor fees</p>
<p>$230 operating expenses (insurance, bank fees, credit card processing, etc)</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>$330 x 3 ~ $1000</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TOTAL: $7500</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Additional funds toward long term, sustainable operations:</strong></p>
<p>Any additional money to this program will help us build up the marketing and staffing of this program.  In order to grown and be sustainable, we'll need to market the program.  If we get enough exposure and enough cards out there in the marketplace, the card fees will cover the costs to operate the program and actually pay some of the people who are currently volunteering countless hours on this project!</p>

</div></div>","Our Story - The Gift Card Loaded with Oakland Love!
We love Oakland. We want jobs for Oaklanders.  We know that supporting local independent businesses and artists -- shopping independently -- keeps and creates local jobs. SO...we want to make it EASY and FUN to do.  This is why we're creating the Oakland Grown Gift Card.  
 
The gift card that you can use at multiple locally-owned businesses. Get local coffee, clothes, housewares, jewelry, kids' stuff...eat at our awesome local restaurants.  Buy art from our amazing local artists... from one fabulous gift card.  
Who are we? We are Oakland Grown - a group of passionate volunteers working to support our local economy by re-directing dollars into the local economy.  We are the product of two non-profit organizations: Oakland Merchants Leadership Forum, where we were born and raised, and the Sustainable Business Alliance, who recently adopted us. Together, we are all working to build a strong, real economy that is healthy and equitable!  
 
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Impact: Stop Money from Leaving Oakland and Create More Jobs!

 
Just about everyone gives and receives gift cards.  For the past 4 years, gift cards were the most requested gifts for the holidays.  $23 billion is spent on gift cards during the holidays nationally, and almost all of it is to chain stores. (Boo!)  Local stores everywhere are almost completely absent from this market.
 
On a per capita basis, that translates to Oaklanders sending more than $25 million right out of our neighborhoods each holiday season through gift card purchases.  
 
The Oakland Grown Gift Card will help change that. 
 
Soon, with your help, we'll be able to offer gift cards that everyone can buy and use with Oakland's coolest local independent businesses and artists, keeping money -- and jobs -- in our community.  
 
Supporting local businesses supports not only retail jobs, but all kinds of other jobs, as our local businesses support other local business owners like graphic designers, accountants, artists, local newspapers, community banks and lots of other businesses and artists that chain stores would not be supporting because they get most of their work done at headquarters somewhere else.  See this idea illustrated in the graphic above.
 
There are lots of other positive impacts of re-directing this money...local independent businesses and artists
  >>  Give more of their revenue to local causes 
  >>  Make our communities more interesting, unique and worth traveling to see
  >>  Carry items by local people and that support the interests of local people
  >>  Diversify our economy portfolio. When we have lots of small businesses, we are putting all of our jobs in 
one place, eggs in one basket.  If we put all our jobs in one big fat store and that store folds or leaves town for a better deal, all of those jobs disappear at once. That's SCARY.

What We Need: $2500 Bare Bones... Eventually Self-Sustaining
 
Bare bones seed costs: 
We are seeking $2500 to seed this project. We need about $7500 in total to get this program off the ground and in operation through the holidays.  We already raised $5000 in sponsorships and now need the final $2500. This will pay for the bare minimum expenses, no marketing budget, all-volunteer operation.
 
Our costs
 
Start Up 
$5000 - custom local gift card program and software development
$500 - designing and setting up the cards
$800 - printing the cards
$250 - merchandizing tools
----------------------------------
$6550  
 
Monthly Fees for 3 Months
$100 program vendor fees
$230 operating expenses (insurance, bank fees, credit card processing, etc)
----------------------------------
$330 x 3 ~ $1000
 
TOTAL: $7500
 
Additional funds toward long term, sustainable operations:
Any additional money to this program will help us build up the marketing and staffing of this program.  In order to grown and be sustainable, we'll need to market the program.  If we get enough exposure and enough cards out there in the marketplace, the card fees will cover the costs to operate the program and actually pay some of the people who are currently volunteering countless hours on this project!
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   I first met CMoe (I’m using a nickname, here, to protect his privacy on this site) when I was hired to work for the same automotive plastics company that would eventually downsize him when Michigan hit hard economic times 4+ years ago. </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;""> </span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   An adult-survivor of child-abuse and neglect, CMoe was a man without roots, relocating every couple of years and starting over, often with little more than a dart to a map to determine his next venture, forever trying to reinvent himself. He moved from state to state, job to job, eventually landing in </span><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">Michigan</span><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;""> where he put himself through college living in a storage shed. He excelled on campus, had seemingly found his niche, and graduated with honors. But a year later, when 9/11 rendered his “Recreational Management” degree essentially useless, he was forced to reinvent himself, once again, only this time carrying tens of thousands in college debt.  </span></span><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">Two steps forward; three, four, five steps back.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   A survivalist at heart, CMoe pulled from his many years of hands-on, MacGyver-like, jack-of-all-trades experience, and he launched a new plan – With ingenuity and an entrepreneurial mind, he partnered with a college associate, invested what savings he had left, and purchased a pair of ramshackle properties, brimming with potential, in this lake-filled, forest-preserved, touristy town in western Michigan.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   By the time CMoe and I met, he was working a full time job, and squeezing in countless extra hours on weekends and late nights to execute the first renovation.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><br/><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   Despite his fiercely guarded nature, CMoe and I forged a fast (if sometimes labor-intensive) friendship. The more I would learn of his story, the more I understood the person inside and would try to find ways to get around his “walls.”<span style=""color: #000000;""><span style="""">  </span>Intentionally looking for a way to speak affirmingly into his life, I invited myself along to see his work on the remodel. I was immediately impressed with his tenacity and vision; and over multiple visits, he would show me some of the basics of how he designed, how to play the ""yellow sticker game"" for killer deals on clearance materials, and all the redesign inspired by the various, choice finds.</span></span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   During those months, my brother and a group of more than a dozen young men from our church also joined forces with CMoe in a kind of old-fashioned ""barn raising"" to demolish and completely rebuild the tattered old, rotting eyesore of a garage, and then again later to strip the two layers of ancient siding, and insulate the house for the first time since its original construction. The work was intense, and the transformation was indeed an extreme make-over! (As you can see by the above pictures.)</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   After CMoe lost his job, ever aware of the need to stay ahead of the increasingly rash actions of his business partner, CMoe remained faithful to his plan, and continued to put the finishing touches on the property, investing – often literally – his own blood, sweat, and tears.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   For CMoe, this was more than a dream of a chance at a new life.<span style=""color: #000000;""><span style="""">  </span>It became, for him, a new way of </span><strong style="""">doing </strong>life, a resolve to finish something he’d started.</span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   As you can see, he virtually single-handedly beautified the first property, metamorphosing it from a $25,000 shack into an $80,000 three-bedroom family home....At great personal cost, he had succeeded in bringing one of the greatest works of his life to completion!...Just in time for the housing market to bottom out.</span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   Still enmeshed with this inveigling business partner, CMoe gave another year of his life and several more thousands of dollars worth of labor and repair to <strong>her</strong> home and property in an effort to salvage their investment, dependent on her promises of payment that would in fact never materialize.<span style=""color: #000000;""><span style="""">  </span>In the end, his house was sold out from under him for less than half of its value, covering barely enough to release the mortgages for the 2 houses, and recovering </span><strong style="""">none</strong> of the cost (in materials and years!) that went into the remodel itself, thoroughly undermining CMoe's chances to turn over his 2<sup>nd</sup> house or make any meaningful progress on his desire to further his vocational training and the hope of future work.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   For a man who, without the support structure of a loving family or faithful friends, has never been able to get his feet firmly under him, this devastation – primarily helmed by this eccentric and ultimately reckless business partner – was damaging in the extreme.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   Forced to live in the gutted, one-bedroom 2nd property that by now had also been seriously damaged by a former tenant, CMoe has since been held hostage another 2+ years, keeping his head above water by pawning his possessions and scrounging up temporary, seasonal and often grueling work for barely more than minimum wage, the last trickle of any remaining unemployment benefits now exhausted.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   Even with no budget, he has already cleared and landscaped the property, cultivated a fruits/herbs/veggie perennial garden, and stock-piled roughly half of all the materials he would need to finish this remodel. But he has been effectively dead-ended by the unavailability of any sustainable employment within a 50 mile radius of this camping/hunting/fishing vacation town, and isolated by unreliable transportation.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   As anyone who has ever had any work done on their house can attest, $7,800 is a comparatively small sum; and we have intentionally kept this request modest. What we have seen this man do by rubbing only a few pennies together is nothing short of miraculous! We believe this modest budget is sufficient to both acquire the remainder of the materials needed to give the house its much-needed refit – as a starter family home, or a charming vacation get-away, or even as an income property for another enterprising soul – as well as protect the home, itself, (and your gifts and CMoe’s future), until final sale.</span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   The immediate goal ~ to have this house finished and listed for sale by no later than the end of summer. We have left the funding ""flexible"" because even a partial offering, here, could have the potential to re-infuse his efforts with enough forward momentum to usher this house to market.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   Will you allow us to stand on your shoulders in this project? This last boost would not only unlock the potential of this little run-down cottage and turn it into someone's dream get-away in Outdoorsman's Paradise here in Michigan, but it would also redeem CMoe’s original dream, enabling him to relocate, and get into a vocation that utilizes his unique gifts and passions, supported by a community of friends who truly love him.</span></p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin: 0in 0in 0pt;""><span style=""color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;"">   If we are (miraculously) able to exceed our goal in obtaining funding, CMoe's plan could reintroduce some of the features of the original version, including floor-plan expansion and the addition of one or more bedrooms, and outfitting the home with various “Green Energy” technologies that would make it more desirable and even self-sustaining, such as adding solar panel roofing to power the refrigerator and waterheater, or enclosing the perennial garden with a greenhouse.</span></p>

UPDATED 5/1/12
THANK YOU TO ALL WHO HAVE GIVEN SO GENEROUSLY!  
WITH ONLINE AND OFFLINE GIFTS, WE HAVE ENDED UP AT ABOUT 20% OF OUR ORIGINAL GOAL, BUT THAT IS SUFFICIENT - IN COMBINATION WITH CMOE'S RECENT RE-HIRE FOR THE SPRING SEASON - FOR HIM TO INCREASE THE CURRENT ""AS IS"" VALUE OF HIS PROPERTY (IF HE IS CREATIVE!) BY POSSIBLY AS MUCH AS 50% BY VIRTUE OF TURNING THE BASEMENT INTO LIVEABLE SPACE.
WE MAY NOT HAVE REACHED OUR ORIGINAL GOAL, BUT THIS IS STILL BETTER THAN WHERE WE STARTED - AND IT GIVES CMOE WHAT HE MOST NEEDED, WHICH IS FORWARD MOMENTUM.
THANK YOU, AGAIN, AND GOD BLESS!

THANK YOU FOR READING CMOE’S STORY!
 
   I first met CMoe (I’m using a nickname, here, to protect his privacy on this site) when I was hired to work for the same automotive plastics company that would eventually downsize him when Michigan hit hard economic times 4+ years ago. 
 
   An adult-survivor of child-abuse and neglect, CMoe was a man without roots, relocating every couple of years and starting over, often with little more than a dart to a map to determine his next venture, forever trying to reinvent himself. He moved from state to state, job to job, eventually landing in Michigan where he put himself through college living in a storage shed. He excelled on campus, had seemingly found his niche, and graduated with honors. But a year later, when 9/11 rendered his “Recreational Management” degree essentially useless, he was forced to reinvent himself, once again, only this time carrying tens of thousands in college debt.  Two steps forward; three, four, five steps back.
 
   A survivalist at heart, CMoe pulled from his many years of hands-on, MacGyver-like, jack-of-all-trades experience, and he launched a new plan – With ingenuity and an entrepreneurial mind, he partnered with a college associate, invested what savings he had left, and purchased a pair of ramshackle properties, brimming with potential, in this lake-filled, forest-preserved, touristy town in western Michigan.
 
   By the time CMoe and I met, he was working a full time job, and squeezing in countless extra hours on weekends and late nights to execute the first renovation.
   Despite his fiercely guarded nature, CMoe and I forged a fast (if sometimes labor-intensive) friendship. The more I would learn of his story, the more I understood the person inside and would try to find ways to get around his “walls.”  Intentionally looking for a way to speak affirmingly into his life, I invited myself along to see his work on the remodel. I was immediately impressed with his tenacity and vision; and over multiple visits, he would show me some of the basics of how he designed, how to play the ""yellow sticker game"" for killer deals on clearance materials, and all the redesign inspired by the various, choice finds.
 
   During those months, my brother and a group of more than a dozen young men from our church also joined forces with CMoe in a kind of old-fashioned ""barn raising"" to demolish and completely rebuild the tattered old, rotting eyesore of a garage, and then again later to strip the two layers of ancient siding, and insulate the house for the first time since its original construction. The work was intense, and the transformation was indeed an extreme make-over! (As you can see by the above pictures.)
 
   After CMoe lost his job, ever aware of the need to stay ahead of the increasingly rash actions of his business partner, CMoe remained faithful to his plan, and continued to put the finishing touches on the property, investing – often literally – his own blood, sweat, and tears.
 
   For CMoe, this was more than a dream of a chance at a new life.  It became, for him, a new way of doing life, a resolve to finish something he’d started.
 
   As you can see, he virtually single-handedly beautified the first property, metamorphosing it from a $25,000 shack into an $80,000 three-bedroom family home....At great personal cost, he had succeeded in bringing one of the greatest works of his life to completion!...Just in time for the housing market to bottom out.
 
 
 
TWO STEPS FORWARD; THREE, FOUR, FIVE STEPS BACK.
 
   Still enmeshed with this inveigling business partner, CMoe gave another year of his life and several more thousands of dollars worth of labor and repair to her home and property in an effort to salvage their investment, dependent on her promises of payment that would in fact never materialize.  In the end, his house was sold out from under him for less than half of its value, covering barely enough to release the mortgages for the 2 houses, and recovering none of the cost (in materials and years!) that went into the remodel itself, thoroughly undermining CMoe's chances to turn over his 2nd house or make any meaningful progress on his desire to further his vocational training and the hope of future work.
 
   For a man who, without the support structure of a loving family or faithful friends, has never been able to get his feet firmly under him, this devastation – primarily helmed by this eccentric and ultimately reckless business partner – was damaging in the extreme.
 
   Forced to live in the gutted, one-bedroom 2nd property that by now had also been seriously damaged by a former tenant, CMoe has since been held hostage another 2+ years, keeping his head above water by pawning his possessions and scrounging up temporary, seasonal and often grueling work for barely more than minimum wage, the last trickle of any remaining unemployment benefits now exhausted.
 
   Even with no budget, he has already cleared and landscaped the property, cultivated a fruits/herbs/veggie perennial garden, and stock-piled roughly half of all the materials he would need to finish this remodel. But he has been effectively dead-ended by the unavailability of any sustainable employment within a 50 mile radius of this camping/hunting/fishing vacation town, and isolated by unreliable transportation.
 
   One remaining fact has anchored his resolve to see his plan through to completion: The very thing that keeps CMoe isolated, here, is nevertheless precisely what we believe will make this property ideal for re-sale ~ its location.
 
 
 
WHAT HE NEEDS …
 
   Timing is of the utmost importance. With the housing market rebounding, the time we must act is now.  CMoe needs just enough water to prime the pump; and the house, the materials he already has, and the property location will provide the rest of the momentum for him.
 
   As anyone who has ever had any work done on their house can attest, $7,800 is a comparatively small sum; and we have intentionally kept this request modest. What we have seen this man do by rubbing only a few pennies together is nothing short of miraculous! We believe this modest budget is sufficient to both acquire the remainder of the materials needed to give the house its much-needed refit – as a starter family home, or a charming vacation get-away, or even as an income property for another enterprising soul – as well as protect the home, itself, (and your gifts and CMoe’s future), until final sale.
 
   The immediate goal ~ to have this house finished and listed for sale by no later than the end of summer. We have left the funding ""flexible"" because even a partial offering, here, could have the potential to re-infuse his efforts with enough forward momentum to usher this house to market.
 
   Will you allow us to stand on your shoulders in this project? This last boost would not only unlock the potential of this little run-down cottage and turn it into someone's dream get-away in Outdoorsman's Paradise here in Michigan, but it would also redeem CMoe’s original dream, enabling him to relocate, and get into a vocation that utilizes his unique gifts and passions, supported by a community of friends who truly love him.
 
   If we are (miraculously) able to exceed our goal in obtaining funding, CMoe's plan could reintroduce some of the features of the original version, including floor-plan expansion and the addition of one or more bedrooms, and outfitting the home with various “Green Energy” technologies that would make it more desirable and even self-sustaining, such as adding solar panel roofing to power the refrigerator and waterheater, or enclosing the perennial garden with a greenhouse.
 
 
**NOTE:  You can give in any increment - you are not locked in to a ""minimum"" except if you claim a specific perk, to the right.**
 
 
 
… AND WHAT YOU GET:
 
   We will be documenting this journey photographically from start to finish, and have incorporated what we hope will be an artful approach to capturing the rest of CMoe's story as part of our Thank You! for any help you are willing and able to give. Please see our *perks* to the right to see what might be the best fit for you!
 
A Few Highlights:
 
   For those of you with a unique eye for one-of-a-kind art, if you are able to invest generously, you might be especially interested in the perk which would give you an original, computer-rendered, 36""x48"" genuine painting (watercolor or oil) from the photo of your choice.
 
   Or if you love to travel, and have a love of the outdoors, and if you are able to give at the $7,800 level and fully fund this project, we would like to commemorate that gift with a package that would turn this lake-filled county into your destination-wrapped-in-mini-vacation. Depending on the time of year, there is a lot to do, here ~ whether you prefer hunting, fishing, boating, hiking, snow sports, motor sports, camping, or if you just like star-gazing without city haze.  This perk provides a round-trip flight from anywhere in the continental U.S.; and waiting for you when you arrive will be vouchers/gift certificates for several of the local eateries and a scenic river canoe trip. If you've got it in you, you could ride the current all the way to Lake Michigan! after which you’ll be bussed back to the canoe livery, so you can't go wrong!  Also, while you are here, you can become a part of the photograph that will be converted to your wall painting, if you wish!  What a great conversation-starter, a testimonial of your faith and philanthropy as you host friends in your home, and you could inspire who knows how many other people!  (Note, at this level, overnight accommodations would be at your discretion and expense, whether you want to stay for one night or several, unless you are the top giver for this campaign....see the next and final *highest funder* perk.)
 
   Finally, though we believe we can finish this project on this proposed shoe-string budget, we also hope that this amount will be exceeded!

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:
 
   You can help us tell CMoe's story! Please post links from this appeal on your Facebook sites, your Blogs, and share with your Churches!
 
   If every member of just one, small town Community Church could give at the $60 level, it could fund this whole project, and testify to the overflow of God's grace in each of our lives!
 
   We are blessed in order to BE a blessing. I have watched, over the years, as this man has wrestled with his demons, and I have seen how his character has compelled him to find ways to “pay it forward,” even when it means being generous out of his own hardship. And CMoe is very superstitious about “not letting grace dead end” on him, as he puts it. Helping him finally reinvent his life will spill over, multiplying out as blessing in the lives of others he is then able to touch. Our generosity, here, is sowing life-giving seed in good soil.

Maybe we can't make a difference to them all, but we can make all the difference to this one.

<p><strong>THE BIG AND WORTHY CAUSE (and 2 fabulous charities)</strong></p>
<p>I'm lucky enough not to have been massively affected by any huge badness or illness. Which got me thinking...such a huge amount about life can depend on where you were born and who to. It’s just luck.  It would be amazing if we could help children born unlucky.</p>
<p>Lucky for us the Mongol Rally thought so too. Their official Rally charity is the <a href=""http://www.lotuschild.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lotus Childrens Fund</a>. These guys do amazing work for children in Mongolia (which seemed appropriate since that is where we will end up... hopefully!)</p>
<p>But Mongolia is quite specific. We wanted to do more. So we have linked up with <a href=""http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SOS Childrens Fund</a> too - the worlds largest Orphan charity. Giving some of the worlds unluckiest children a home and a big break in life.  This is the kind of stuff they can make happen - how cool is this (<a href=""http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/archive/2012/01/the-strength-to-power-on-adelines-story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/archive/2012/01/the-strength-to-power-on-adelines-story</a>)</p>
<p><strong>THE BIG IDEA</strong> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">– the more you give the more we do just for you.</span></p>
<p>What if we linked a big, ridiculous, probably dangerous event to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube (and Indiegogo) so that you could not only follow it, but you could influence it - so it became your event and the more you donate the more control you could have?</p>
<p><strong>THE BIG EVENT - HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO?</strong></p>
<p>Marathons, triathlons, mountainous cycle rides, one week silences and 40 day fasts didnt seem far enough. </p>
<p>Then we discovered the <a href=""http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/mongol-rally"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mongol Rally</a> - A race across a third of the world from England to Mongolia, across 16 countries, a fifth with barely any roads, some at war, lots of corrupt officals and plenty of space for your imagination. And it has to be done in a car about the same size as a lawn-mower. </p>

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","We are Guy, Ed and Arnout – Our idea is to drive across the world to visit and raise money for some very unlucky children. We have the incredible sponsorship of Chevrolet to cover our costs and car so EVERYTHING from this page goes to HELPING OUR 2 AMAZING CHARITIES.
THE BIG AND WORTHY CAUSE (and 2 fabulous charities)
I'm lucky enough not to have been massively affected by any huge badness or illness. Which got me thinking...such a huge amount about life can depend on where you were born and who to. It’s just luck.  It would be amazing if we could help children born unlucky.
Lucky for us the Mongol Rally thought so too. Their official Rally charity is the Lotus Childrens Fund. These guys do amazing work for children in Mongolia (which seemed appropriate since that is where we will end up... hopefully!)
But Mongolia is quite specific. We wanted to do more. So we have linked up with SOS Childrens Fund too - the worlds largest Orphan charity. Giving some of the worlds unluckiest children a home and a big break in life.  This is the kind of stuff they can make happen - how cool is this (http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/charity-news/archive/2012/01/the-strength-to-power-on-adelines-story)
THE BIG IDEA – the more you give the more we do just for you.
What if we linked a big, ridiculous, probably dangerous event to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube (and Indiegogo) so that you could not only follow it, but you could influence it - so it became your event and the more you donate the more control you could have?
THE BIG EVENT - HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO?
Marathons, triathlons, mountainous cycle rides, one week silences and 40 day fasts didnt seem far enough. 
Then we discovered the Mongol Rally - A race across a third of the world from England to Mongolia, across 16 countries, a fifth with barely any roads, some at war, lots of corrupt officals and plenty of space for your imagination. And it has to be done in a car about the same size as a lawn-mower. 

HOW IT WORKS
We have set up some social network pages.
FACEBOOK, TWITTER, YOUTUBE
1)   You donate cash (see right) to our good cause (see below),
2)  The more you donate the more we do for you. (NEXT WEEK WE RELEASE THE BIG $$ OPTIONS - We are talking fancy dress, truth or dare, tell us where to drive and lots of other things) 
3)   We will post all this on Facebook for you to enjoy.
4)   This way you get much more involved for the money you donate.
5)   This will all happen as we attempt to drive a tiny car from London to Mongolia.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been dreaming of owning and operating my own coffeeshop for years.  At the begining of the summer the opportunity fell into my lap that I was unable to walk away from.  The owner of the Coffee Roaster Fat Boy Roasters in Tijeras, NM had just recently expanded his roasting facilities and had a 300 square foot front room he wasn't using and apporached me about subleasing the space from him to run a small walk up coffee shop.  I inherited a beautiful Espresso Machine and grinder from a friend in Denver and have been working on the space since early June.  We have accomplished a lot of work in the past two months, installed the machines, plumbing, painting, installed a new counter, purchased a POS and register system and are getting extremely close to being able to put in for our business license for my dream, my baby Muskrat Coffee.  </p>
<p>I will be the sole propietor and owner/operator of Muskrat Coffee and have over the summer dumped my entire savings, my Starbucks Stocks and even my parents Bank of America stocks into this dream.  I am so close and now the final sprint in almost at hand for getting the transition of this Muskrat from frolicking days down America's railroads and backroads to running his own small coffeeshop.  </p>
<p>As Sir ernest Shackelton has taught me, when time are tough, Grin and bear it, growl and go and you will make it.  Muskrat Coffee will open this fall and by golly I will make it happen.  </p>

<h3>What <em>is </em>Special Surfer Night?</h3>
<p>Special Surfer Night is a program that happens every 3rd Tuesday of June, July and August where we take kids with special needs out surfing.  We have kids on the Autism Spectrum, kids and young adults with Down’s syndrome, a young man with Dubowitz syndrome, you name it. We take anyone who feels like the program is a good fit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who are the people behind Special Surfer Night?</h3>
<p>To start with, Maureen Dow, our local connection to the Autism/Asperger community. Nanci Boutet, owner of Aquaholics Surf Shop AND, most of all, the HUNDREDS of volunteers. We are nearing the 1,000 volunteer mark. Once you’ve come to help with this event, wild horses can’t keep you away.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How did it start?</h3>
<p>Aquaholics was still a small surf shop in 2 tiny adjoining apartments with 5 soft rental boards when my friend Maureen Dow called to ask if we would take a few of her “kiddos” out surfing. She had heard about a program out West and thought we should try it. THANKS MAUREEN!</p>
<p>In that 1st year, we had 3 surfers. That was 2005. Last year, in 2012, we had 92 kids signed up.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>We try to have 2 volunteers for each Special Surfer. One (preferably) surfer and one (no skill needed) “catcher”. The surfer volunteer has control of the Special Surfer (we call them “Surfer Dudes”) and the board. They provide the timing, balance and skill set needed to (hopefully) keep the “drinks from the firehose” to a minimum. The “catcher” waits for the Surfer Dudes to finish their rides at the shore and redirects the Surfer Dude back out to the waiting surfer volunteer. We need to keep the mayhem to a minimum with HUNDREDS of people in the water, so 2 volunteers are essential.  We ask the parents to relax and socialize with other parents of these great kids on shore and “leave the driving to us”.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why do we need money?</h3>
<p>Last year, we had open registration. In June we had 50 kids. Those kids had a blast and told everyone they saw. In July we had 75 kids. THEY had a blast and told everyone THEY saw. In August we had 92 kids registered. Even with begging and borrowing every soft board and SUP (thanks to the other shops and SUP tour companies), we still came up short and had to run shifts.  Well, that got VERY confusing. Think of 92 special needs kids and their parents and volunteers putting on and taking off wetsuits, then putting on WET wetsuits (hard enough to get into DRY), then finding an available board and two volunteers left over from the first shift, well you get the picture.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>That’s where you come in!</h3>
<p>This year, each month, we have registration capped at 35.  All 3 nights are full. We have a lot of disappointed parents and kids. We don’t like to disappoint these kids. It makes us sad. We at Aquaholics would like to open registration so that every kid who wants to surf can sign up! To do that, we need to buy 50 more boards, leashes and wetsuits, AND a shed to put it all in (these things don’t disappear between sessions). We’ll probably get a trailer if we get more than we strive for but that’s just frosting on the cake.  We’ll buy as much equipment as we can and open as many spots for kids to register as we get funding for. No matter how much we get, we’ll take as many kids on as we can afford! Help us out!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What are these awards about?</h3>
<p>These are goods and services given by people who have seen this program in action. Some are our friends, some are total strangers who have seen Special Surfer Night on the news, in the paper or heard about it from participants. Barbara Bush nominated us for the “Thousand Points of Light Award” after seeing us while she was having her evening walk. You CAN’T miss us. We take the place by storm!</p>
<p>You are not “buying” these awards, these are our way of saying thank you for supporting our program. The tiers are not so much the value of the goods and services, they are our special way of showing appreciation for your “volunteering” effort (we know you worked for this!). Some of us can afford a lot, some of us can just say “yes, I’m in”. All of these people giving these awards are giving a little piece if their hearts-what they do in this life to get by. They are offering you their gratitude.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What do you get for your generosity?</h3>
<p>This is not a tax deductible “donation”. This is a sponsorship. This is something you do for many reasons. To get the ultimate warm and fuzzy, to help a kid who rarely “fits in” to be part of the “Cool Kids Club”, to create havoc for three nights at the beach (a HUGE plus if you’re an Anarchist!) and to give these parents a little break from their busy day.  Most of all, your Karma will get a big boost!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How long will your sponsorship effect the program?</h3>
<p>The wetsuits last a year or two, it’s the nature of the rubber and the wear and tear from tugging and pulling on the suit. Sometimes they last a couple of years, sometimes they last a few wears. The boards last several years. We use the best boards we have found. Global Surf Industries Gnaraloo Soft tops. These are the best riding, best lasting and safest “softies”. The leashes, they’re like the suits they wear out fast. The shed? Yeah, that’s gonna last a few decades at least!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What else can you do?</h3>
<p>Well, you can come watch, help, SHARE on facebook, twitter, email. Please spread the word! These parents and friends of the Surfer Dudes thank me with all their hearts and I want to thank THEM for sharing their great “kiddos”. I can tell you- this is my favorite part of the summer, and it will be yours too! And I LOVE summer!</p>
<p>* All of the perks levels above $500 get their name or web address on a board.</p>

<h1>Process of Making Don Juan Tequila</h1>
<p>Don Juan Tequila is a fine sipping baroque tequila made from 100% Blue Agave Tequilana Weber and produced in Amatitan, Jalisco the birthplace of tequila and officially recognized in 1769, by the Real Audiencia (Royal Court) of Guadalajara, as the principal manufacturing center of “vino mezcal” the name used to describe the distilled agave spirit before it was known as tequila.</p>
<p><strong>Piña Selection</strong></p>
<p>Our careful selection of perfectly matured eight year-old Blue Agave gives us simply the best possible ripe piña that will, in turn, create the richest natural sugars that, after the fermentation and distillation process, will produce untamed and seductive alcohol that will be finessed and spirited into the elegant creation of Don Juan Tequila Silver, Reposado and Añejo.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking process</strong></p>
<p>Many mass-producing tequila distilleries use modern stainless steel ovens to cook their piñas. Don Juan Tequila piñas are cooked using an earth- stone oven; a traditional method that guarantees a more ardent and direct flavorful tequila.</p>
<p><strong>Fermentation</strong></p>
<p>Once the agave has been carefully cooked it goes through a milling process to extract the agua-miel which is the sap or juice containing all the sugar that, after the fermentation process will turn into pure and raw alcohol. To complement the traditional earth-stone cooking method, the fermentation process is also performed using an all natural open air process with a long  slow fermentation period to produce a more natural intense flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Distillation</strong></p>
<p>The process continues when the spirit is moved from the fermentation vats to the unique stainless steel alambiques (stills) used for the distillation process. Many distilleries will run their spirit through a third distillation process. However, this method, many times, robs the tequila from its intentional purpose and integrity. Don Juan Tequila is distilled twice like many fine whiskeys or vodkas, giving the connoisseur the baroque experience of the whole process and the enjoyment of a smooth, refined and seductive spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Aging</strong></p>
<p>The Art of Seduction begins with Don Juan Tequila Silver which is the purest tequila in its noblest form. Traditionally, blanco or silver tequila has been reserved or used as a shot drink or as part of a mixed cocktail. However, our Master Distiller designed and crafted the Don Juan Tequila Silver to be savored and enjoyed as a fine sipping tequila, as consumed for centuries in its birthplace, Mexico. </p>
<p> For our aged tequilas, Don Juan Tequila Reposado and Don Juan Tequila Añejo, the Art of Seduction continues, as our Master Distiller orchestrates his aging artistry employing used American bourbon oak barrels to give the spirit its carefully crafted baroque characteristics as manifested by the final product’s rich color, aromatic bouquet and multi-layered flavors. Our aged tequilas were also designed and crafted to be enjoyed as a fine sipping tequila, as an aperitif or digestive, neat, chilled, on crushed ice, or whatever your pleasure demands. Don Juan Tequila is a complete experience, as we will guide you with recommended food pairings, recipes and even music to fully exploit your encounter and pleasure of a bottle of Don Juan Tequila.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Let's break it down:</span><br/></p>
<p>1) Preparing meals and desserts from scratch is a <a href=""http://www.myfitnesspal.com/exercise/calories-burned/cooking-or-food-preparation-47"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">calorie-burning activity</a>. By making this activity part of our daily lives, we could easily increase the amount of calories we burn each day, even if we can't get in a traditional workout.</p>
<p>2) Preparing whole food meals requires muscle and it strengthens our muscles. Simply standing in the kitchen for 30-90 minutes utilizes your core. Without good posture and engaging the right muscles, you'll start to experience back pain. Chopping involves the arm, shoulder and core. Good strength is essential for the citrus press, salad spinner, spiralizer and the list goes on. Furthermore, the creativity, math and planning involved with cooking is strengthening our minds.</p>
<p>3) Eating a whole food, plant-based diet is building our fitness by promoting a healthy weight and provides optimal nutrition so we can perform at our best. It also limits consumption of excess cholesterol, salt, unhealthy fats, and refined sugar.</p>
<p>4) The motivating culture and social influence at a gym is ideal for bringing new people, influencing behavior change, and raising dopamine levels so people return regularly. We expect this to be effective in creating a local community around a plant-based diet. We also believe the culinary gym will attract more young people, allowing them to experience a plant-based way and learn how to prepare whole foods before becoming sick and overweight.</p>

When you get home you feel more comfortable in the kitchen and excited knowing that you can make healthy, plant-based meals your family will love. You won't be surprised when they request seconds.











Our Classes Improve Appearance & Performance.
Let's break it down:
1) Preparing meals and desserts from scratch is a calorie-burning activity. By making this activity part of our daily lives, we could easily increase the amount of calories we burn each day, even if we can't get in a traditional workout.
2) Preparing whole food meals requires muscle and it strengthens our muscles. Simply standing in the kitchen for 30-90 minutes utilizes your core. Without good posture and engaging the right muscles, you'll start to experience back pain. Chopping involves the arm, shoulder and core. Good strength is essential for the citrus press, salad spinner, spiralizer and the list goes on. Furthermore, the creativity, math and planning involved with cooking is strengthening our minds.
3) Eating a whole food, plant-based diet is building our fitness by promoting a healthy weight and provides optimal nutrition so we can perform at our best. It also limits consumption of excess cholesterol, salt, unhealthy fats, and refined sugar.
4) The motivating culture and social influence at a gym is ideal for bringing new people, influencing behavior change, and raising dopamine levels so people return regularly. We expect this to be effective in creating a local community around a plant-based diet. We also believe the culinary gym will attract more young people, allowing them to experience a plant-based way and learn how to prepare whole foods before becoming sick and overweight.

Rio Negro experienced horrific violence in 1980 and 1982 at the hands of military and civil patrols. Survivors were forced to flee to the surrounding fragile hillsides to endure years of isolation and danger. Many survivors were later relocated to a nearby settlement at Pacux - the community's case has been taken before the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p>Many members of the community have returned to their land, though now mostly flooded by the Chixoy river dam. Unfortunately, their relative isolation and diminished population make self-sufficiency difficult to sustain. With their arable land largely now flooded, they live with little food security. Still, the community is full of hope, and it has miraculously forgiven the neighboring Xococ community that perpetrated the massacres.  With international support, they have also created an historical memory center to house visitors to the village. The center more formally <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">gives the village a venue to tell the story of the violence that befell their community during the Guatemalan civil war. The center is part and parcel of the community’s efforts to pursue justice for those who committed the atrocities, reparation for lost land and harm done to the community, and international human rights recognition. Also, with each visitor Rio Negro receives income.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The CGI graduate students visited the village to bear witness to Rio Negro’s story, to their testimony, and to begin forming relationships. We were all moved by the remarkable witness to faith and courage manifested by those we met. On the group’s last day in Rio Negro, one of the village elders, Don Cupertino, invited the Notre Dame graduate students to work with them to assist in their process of re-building their chapel in the community. The current chapel is dilapidated – its walls are falling in and it is unusable. It needs serious repair. The new Chapel will also serve as an important multi-use space in the village, too. Correspondingly, the community drew up architectural plans, a budget, and a three-phase construction plan. <i>They have extended a generous invitation to us all to collaborate with them in the building process!</i> Please help us to help this community that shared its story of pain and hope with us. Moving forward, our group has been fortunate enough to partner with <i>World Care</i> to coordinate getting funds to the community and its partner organization, CECEP (<a href=""http://www.cecep.cosmosmaya.info/menu_04.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.cecep.cosmosmaya.info/menu_04.htm</a>). World Care will be a tremendous partner on the project moving forward!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>The CGI group did a family and friends letter writing and petition campaign this spring and raised just under $4,000 for the first phase of construction. A more lengthy description of Phase 1 of the project can be found on our fundraising blog, rionegrochapel.wordpress.com - check it out! Construction has begun! On that webpage, you'll also find more formal design and budget documents, as well as the most up-to-date details on the construction project. The entire first phase will total to between $4,000-$4,500 when all is said and done, and the second phase will total to approximately $3,500. The pictures you see above are of the community working toward the completion of Phase 1. Included in the costs are building materials, transportation costs, construction advising fees, and wages for community members working on the project. There are also minor fees built into working with Indiegogo and World Care.  </p>
<p>Your donation here, in conjunction with other fundraising efforts, will be used to complete Phase 1 and to launch/complete Phase 2. The first phase of construction laid much of the elementary work for the Chapel - clearing and leveling the space, acquiring and transporting building materials, paying for engineering supervision, wages for the community, constructing the foundation and columns for the Chapel, and the beginning stages of constructing furniture for the Chapel (doors, pews, pulpit, and pews). You can see the Phase 1 expense report on our fundraising website (rionegrochapel.wordpress.com). The second phase will be to build the structure more formally and will include the construction of walls and top columns, the purchasing of 30% of the wooden beams and rulers for the roof, an additional 30% of engineering supervision costs, and 30% of the costs associated with wooden boards to construct the Chapel's furniture, windows, and door. Up-to-date construction schedules and progress can be found on our fundraising website. CGI student participants will also be engaging in local fundraising efforts throughout the Fall to assist in meeting the final, phase three funding goals.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>As one of our student participants said, ""For the community at Rio Negro, the experience of healing has been one fraught with tribulations and difficulties, especially  due to the fact that the Guatemalan government has not prosecuted any of those who were involved in the massacres... In our discussions with community leaders in Rio Negro, we learned that their faith provided a source of solace and comfort as they worked to rebuild their lives and community.  Worship led them to a deeper encounter with God and enabled them to embrace forgiveness as a mode for healing.  Above all, it became evident to me that church is central to the ethos of this community.  Bearing this in mind, it seems only fitting that they have a space that is safe for them to gather, to worship God and to support one another in their journey of healing.  They need a church where they can be Church.”</div>
<div>This project, which has been dreamt and planned by this community, is one that will contribute to the on-going healing and development of this courageous community. It will be a place for worship, for hospitality, and for healing.

 Because Alex and Kris are not millionaires it has been impossible  rather difficult to secure any kind of bank loan against our zero collateral. So coming up with funding this far has been... challenging. We have had to come up with some creative solutions to get as far as we have, scaling back (nixed the full sauna and charmin ultra plush), opening later than we had hoped, finding friends in unexpected places. That said, we know that with your help we can bridge the funding gap and build something... well... awesome!

I moved to United States precisely to New York City when I was 18 years old. My wish was to live the American dream that I have seen a lot on  television  when I was growing up but that wasn't what happened . My first five years living in the city I struggled a lot. I had a hard time finding a job because my English was really bad. I could barely  afford to pay for rent and food, with the little savings that I had from back home. At the age of 25 I had the idea of becoming an entrepreneur but I didn't know exactly how that was going to  happen. One day through a job search , I had a proposition to be a cleaner in  an Italian restaurant. It's was overnight job and it was really hard. Even though, the job was hard, I learned two lessons. When you exceed other’s expectations and put forth a lot of effort, it leads to greater opportunities.  That overnight job turned into a full time job.  I had to work 8 hours a day , 6 days a week with a half-hour break. The job consisted of moving heavy couches and chairs around, cleaning and mopping the floor, clean the grill, windows, and rest rooms. I worked in the restaurant for one year and few months, until I was laid off from the recession.  When I got laid off, I knew that I needed to control my own destiny. The only way to do that was to take the plunge into entrepreneurship. That's when I decided to create my own cleaning service company called Es Eco Cleaning Service to become a professional cleaner because I knew that it would be better for me.  </p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; font-size: 14px;""></span></p><p>When
 I first started to put ideas together, It was really frustrating 
 because I was  facing  many challenges such as, financial difficulties ,
 keeping up with the market, planning ahead, solving problems and 
knowing the right systems. It wasn't easy for a beginner.</p><br/><p> The
 beginning of the company will have a huge impact on the community and 
society not only providing high cleaning maintenance in New York metro 
area  but also offering  job opportunities, and take it to a future

I moved to United States precisely to New York City when I was 18 years old. My wish was to live the American dream that I have seen a lot on  television  when I was growing up but that wasn't what happened . My first five years living in the city I struggled a lot. I had a hard time finding a job because my English was really bad. I could barely  afford to pay for rent and food, with the little savings that I had from back home. At the age of 25 I had the idea of becoming an entrepreneur but I didn't know exactly how that was going to  happen. One day through a job search , I had a proposition to be a cleaner in  an Italian restaurant. It's was overnight job and it was really hard. Even though, the job was hard, I learned two lessons. When you exceed other’s expectations and put forth a lot of effort, it leads to greater opportunities.  That overnight job turned into a full time job.  I had to work 8 hours a day , 6 days a week with a half-hour break. The job consisted of moving heavy couches and chairs around, cleaning and mopping the floor, clean the grill, windows, and rest rooms. I worked in the restaurant for one year and few months, until I was laid off from the recession.  When I got laid off, I knew that I needed to control my own destiny. The only way to do that was to take the plunge into entrepreneurship. That's when I decided to create my own cleaning service company called Es Eco Cleaning Service to become a professional cleaner because I knew that it would be better for me.  When
 I first started to put ideas together, It was really frustrating 
 because I was  facing  many challenges such as, financial difficulties ,
 keeping up with the market, planning ahead, solving problems and 
knowing the right systems. It wasn't easy for a beginner. The
 beginning of the company will have a huge impact on the community and 
society not only providing high cleaning maintenance in New York metro 
area  but also offering  job opportunities, and take it to a future 
 better than today. I
 am few steps away  from starting my company. I am therefore confronted 
to face some unexpected financial issues. I, however managed to get a 
few things done with the funds that I had such as  business cards, a 
website, T-shirts and some equipment.  The 7,000 dollars I am raising

<p><br/>Hello there!<br/>My name is Panos Kalafatis and I was brought up in a family-owned hotel 17km south of Delphi. So one thing I know well, is hospitality!<br/><br/>Recently we (my family) inherited a house in Athens which we intend to renovate and post it up on Wimbu,com for short stay rentals. However due to the state the house was delivered, we will need some financial assistance to get it ready. The whole project will cost 10000 euros and our finances can only make it to 2000 euros, leaving 8000 euros to be desired. <br/></p>
<p>By buying our services and perks you will help my family, in these trying times, to create a small additional income that will go a long way! Of course, even if you don't intend on coming to Athens but feel like donating towards our goal, you are welcome to do so! It will be deeply appreciated and, equally, we looking forward in having you over in Athens.<br/></p>
<p><i><b><br/>Few words about the house:</b></i></p>
<p>The house is located in Kallithea, one of the 50 municipalities that make up Athens that lies between Athens city center and Piraeus port.  The house is 2 minutes walking distance from the old metro station ""Kallithea"". From this station, Central Athens and sightseeing hot-spots, are reached in 10~15 minutes and the Piraeus harbor in 10 minutes. Day tickets (24h) for all public transport is currently at 4 euros and at 1.20 euros you buy 70 minutes of travel time. No need to rent a car or get into a taxi while exploring the main sights. Comfortable shoes is a must!<br/></p>
<p>Following the building style of the '60, the house has high ceilings and fairly large surface area (140 square meters). It has two bathrooms, one with a large bathtub, and another smaller with a shower. It has 4  medium rooms and a small living room adjacent to a kitchen.  </p>
<p>This project and everything that is offered here will be valid for three years so don't worry about getting here this summer. Plus, we will be open all year around and you can take up on it any time. When the room rental go live it will be at 26 euros per room ( accommodates 2 people) per night.<br/><br/>The provisions that will be included will be:</p>
<ul>
<li> free wifi access, <br/>

<p><br/></p>
<br/><p>Because Fishtown has done so much for us, we would like to return the favor, by opening a coffee shop. We want to open something that embodies the spirit of the community. Both the old and the new life being added. In addition to fostering our community, we want to showcase one of the things we truly love...art. We want to highlight both genres and people that are underrepresented within the Frankford arts Corridor. As for our coffee, we will serve one local Pennsylvania roster, and feature a rotating selection of roasters from across the country.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign you will not only be helping two young women fulfill their dreams and become entrepreneurs, you will be helping a often overlooked, overshadowed and little known section of this growing neighborhood become economical viable.</p>

<h3>The Breakdown<br/>
</h3> </div><div>
<div>Every bit you give will bring us one step closer to our goal of making this community space a reality. We would like to break down exactly what your money is going towards</div>
<div><b>1) Making it Legit: $3,500</b></div>
<div>This money will go towards making our company LLC certified with the city and getting serv safe certified so that we will be able to serve you all delicious food! This money will also go towards helping us secure our space by putting a deposit so that we can start making our shop beautiful.</div>
<div><b>2) Furniture: $5,000</b></div>
<div>We will be hiring a local furniture maker to create wonderfully, unique tables and chairs. Support the community!</div>
<div><b>3) Plumber: $1,000</b></div>
<div>Plumbing, everyone needs running water</div>
<div><b>4) Cups, Plates + more: $2,300</b></div>
<div>This includes all the paper cups, straws, lids, plates and glassware that delectable food and drinks will be served in</div>
<div><b>5) Coffee, coffee, coffee! (and tea!): $6,000</b></div>
<div>Yes coffee is expensive and that is why we picked some of the best roasters. We have to make it count!</div>
<div><b>6) Graphic Designer: $200</b></div>
<div>This money goes toward paying the awesome artist that is doing all the branding for us.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>We have pooled resources from our friends, artists and our own pockets to offer you some banging swag! We are going to have an awesome shop and we are offering a lot of things to show how much we care about our future customers. From keep cups, shout outs, a private latte art class and prints from amazing artists, there is something for everyone.</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Should we not reach our goal, depending on what we have, we will put it towards our ""make it legit"" goal. Even though coffee is a large part of our budget, It is a perishable good, We only want to bring the freshest and best to our customers.</span><br/><br/>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3>Get to know us!<br/>
</h3> <ul><li><p><span>As years long residents of this neighborhood we know what it is lacking and plan to fill that void. We know that a sense of community is what drives the Fishtown/New Kensington neighborhood and we want to nurture that.

We want to stay and make this place even better than it already is. We want to show them that not only do we care about them, but about what we produce and do for ourselves.</span></p></li></ul>

</div> <div> <h3>It gets scary sometimes..<br/>
</h3> <p> </p>
<ul><li>One of the problems we will face as a brand new business is gathering enough funds to secure our space in a timely manner so that we do not lose our great space. It was previously a bar and our wonderful landlords have kept it in amazing condition. However, we still have some construction to allow our dream to fit. We will be using a local makers and builders to construct our peaceful, calm and funky space. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Wonderful handmade furniture made locally to highlight one of the wonderful artists we have in the Philadelphia area. This is important to us because we want our shop to have the essence of Philadelphia in it in every aspect. We want to stay true to our vision of supporting local artist in goods as much as possible. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Our cute shop is located next to a school, transportation and right off the Frankford corridor of the arts.

</div></div>","To Begin...
 Hi there!
We are Gia and Ade, two lovely ladies who have made our homes, and given our hearts to the Fishtown neighborhood in Philadelphia.



Because Fishtown has done so much for us, we would like to return the favor, by opening a coffee shop. We want to open something that embodies the spirit of the community. Both the old and the new life being added. In addition to fostering our community, we want to showcase one of the things we truly love...art. We want to highlight both genres and people that are underrepresented within the Frankford arts Corridor. As for our coffee, we will serve one local Pennsylvania roster, and feature a rotating selection of roasters from across the country.
By contributing to our campaign you will not only be helping two young women fulfill their dreams and become entrepreneurs, you will be helping a often overlooked, overshadowed and little known section of this growing neighborhood become economical viable.




The Breakdown
 
Every bit you give will bring us one step closer to our goal of making this community space a reality. We would like to break down exactly what your money is going towards
1) Making it Legit: $3,500
This money will go towards making our company LLC certified with the city and getting serv safe certified so that we will be able to serve you all delicious food! This money will also go towards helping us secure our space by putting a deposit so that we can start making our shop beautiful.
2) Furniture: $5,000
We will be hiring a local furniture maker to create wonderfully, unique tables and chairs. Support the community!
3) Plumber: $1,000
Plumbing, everyone needs running water
4) Cups, Plates + more: $2,300
This includes all the paper cups, straws, lids, plates and glassware that delectable food and drinks will be served in
5) Coffee, coffee, coffee! (and tea!): $6,000
Yes coffee is expensive and that is why we picked some of the best roasters. We have to make it count!
6) Graphic Designer: $200
This money goes toward paying the awesome artist that is doing all the branding for us.

We have pooled resources from our friends, artists and our own pockets to offer you some banging swag! We are going to have an awesome shop and we are offering a lot of things to show how much we care about our future customers. From keep cups, shout outs, a private latte art class and prints from amazing artists, there is something for everyone.

Should we not reach our goal, depending on what we have, we will put it towards our ""make it legit"" goal. Even though coffee is a large part of our budget, It is a perishable good, We only want to bring the freshest and best to our customers.

  Get to know us!
 As years long residents of this neighborhood we know what it is lacking and plan to fill that void. We know that a sense of community is what drives the Fishtown/New Kensington neighborhood and we want to nurture that. By partnering with artists for small workshops once we have become established, as well as with neighborhood institutions, we will make sure that the neighborhood knows we are not just here to capitalize on the money coming in or step on those already here. We want to stay and make this place even better than it already is. We want to show them that not only do we care about them, but about what we produce and do for ourselves.


one of the wonderful organizations that we are working with



Incarnate Coffee is the embodiment of great coffee, community and underrepresented art. It aims to be an approachable coffee buying experience and atmosphere. One that promotes marginalized artists, longtime residents, and those just starting to settle in the reemerging Frankford Arts Corridor.


In regards to growth, this direct area is
going through developmental changes. The neighborhood is seeing a lot of growth
both providentially and commercially. We would like
to set he precedent and tone for the change


Our goal is to be a successful shop that makes
a positive impact within the community, through our beverages and fostering a
welcoming atmosphere.

Adesola has years of training in specialty cheese, beer and coffee. She has worked in buying and management positions at Whole Foods Market & Di Bruno Bros. With a degree in the arts, she has a unique approach to problem solving, event planning and curating shows, and has carried this every step of the way to be successful in every role she has taken on.




Gia Parker has years of knowledge in the retail and small business management world. From having worked with luxury accessories designers, contemporary footwear showrooms,to eCommerce sites and local boutiques. She knows the ins and outs of how both a successful and and unsuccessful business are run and will bring her go getter attitude as well as knowledge to the business to help it run smoothly.

Our basic business philosophy is that you can teach anyone to make a decent coffee, but it takes passion and love of the craft to repeatedly produce something so deliciously well made, that it makes you want to stop everything and focus on that one moment and place.




one of the lovely murals celebrating arts and  great vibes that abound in Fishtown
  It gets scary sometimes..
  
One of the problems we will face as a brand new business is gathering enough funds to secure our space in a timely manner so that we do not lose our great space. It was previously a bar and our wonderful landlords have kept it in amazing condition. However, we still have some construction to allow our dream to fit. We will be using a local makers and builders to construct our peaceful, calm and funky space. 
Wonderful handmade furniture made locally to highlight one of the wonderful artists we have in the Philadelphia area. This is important to us because we want our shop to have the essence of Philadelphia in it in every aspect. We want to stay true to our vision of supporting local artist in goods as much as possible. 
Our cute shop is located next to a school, transportation and right off the Frankford corridor of the arts. There are many art studios in this area and a lot of homes being built, as this location is about to explode and we would like to be a part of creating the identity of this area of Fishtown. Even though there is a boom happening here, this area is relatively free of commercial business, which can be both a blessing and a hindrance as people are now used to having to leave this vicinity for their needs.
  As any new business owner will tell you, it is hard trying to start any kind of business especially when you have little to no money. However, we have been working with many neighborhood people, banks, organizations in the community who have been so wonderful taking time out of their day to advise and lead us to who or what will make us successful. 

even the trashcans are art around here!!

</div></div>","What if there was a social network specifically designed to connect travellers by creating travel diaries and sharing your adventures?We want to build it.Introducing nomadmovement. Travel
isn’t just about the holiday itself; it’s in the planning, the
anticipation, and then it’s all in the re-telling and the memories. Travel is the gift that keeps giving, and the one we share with the people we love through emails, letters, postcards, showing photos and videos, and posting on blogs and social media.
www.nomadmovement.com


We couldn’t find a social network that
worked for travellers, so we are building it ourselves – with your help. 


There
was no online platform that felt right, where we could:


share our travel photos


write our memories and
stories, explain our adventures


give travel tips and hints


browse other people’s
travel diaries


search by location, travel
type or keyword


research ideas for our
next trip


be inspired by other
travelers’ stories, visally and with words


meet other adventurers
outside of our own friend and family networks


experience a visually
beautiful site, uncluttered by advertising and confusing applications



How does it work?Inspired by a journal,
nomadmovement is your personal online travel story. Using your pictures, words,
links and maps, you can bring people along with you on your adventures; family,
friends, strangers, friends you haven’t met yet.

What's in it for you?

There are definitely perks in being a nomad; especially a nomad in on the ground floor, before nomadmovement launches into the next big social media movement.
We started nomadmovement as travelers who were looking for an experience sharing platform that simply didn’t exist. Our end product is all about sharing, and crowdfunding brings the sharing moment right from the start.






Beyond sharing your travel adventures with just your
friends, family and anyone who stumbles across your blog, nomadmovement offers
an interactive social media experience:



make friends with the same travel passions


follow people who’s adventures inspire you


gather followers and create your own travel empire


give your travel tips and practical hints from your own experiences


take the insider info from fellow nomads



Our people are nomads, just like you.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Prologue: Once Upon A Time...</h3> <p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.” - Nagasawa, Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Now, there are lots of books we all should read. I personally recommend Murakami to everyone I get the chance to. And there are the classics: Jane Austen is a must; Dickens? Absolutely! George Orwell, I’d certainly say so.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">But as good as the Gone Girls and Harry Potter’s of the world are, there’s hundreds, if not thousands, of wonderful books out there in the world that most people simply never come across.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">And don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that Gone Girl and Harry Potter aren’t absolutely fantastic - and I, as a confirmed Ravenclaw, would certainly not wish to dissuade you from reading either. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">But I guess I’ve always been a big fan of being different. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Whenever I discover a new book or author that I love, I am filled with such pure joy. Particularly when it's one that I only by chance stumbled across. Even more so if it involves a genre or topic I wouldn’t usually pick up that gets me out of my reading comfort zone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">There are so many hidden gem books out there. And I want to bring that feeling of finding that special, previously-unknown book to as many people as possible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">That’s why I am launching my business:  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446395187/hyujp11efkk0qdiz0zxz.png"" src="""" style=""width: 252px; height: 252px;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A subscription box book club that will, each month, send out a delightfully packaged box to subscribers, containing one such above-mentioned book, along with some extra goodies, themed around that particular book, to really enhance the experience of reading it. Then we can all read and discuss the book and our experience with it via The Joy Book Club's website and social media. And, to ensure we #ShareTheBookJoy as much as possible, £1 from each box will go to different book-related charities each month! Lovely.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Sound like fun?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I am currently planning to send out my first round of boxes (those ordered through this campaign) at the end of January 2016 and open my online shop to subscriptions on February 1st 2016. (Subscriptions for the first box will also open early on the website from the beginning of December at the full price of £15.99 per box, as part of our pre-launch).</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">But to do that, I need a little help :-)<br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes."" - Desiderius Erasmus</i></p>
<p>Right folks, let's get down to the nitty-gritty:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>What do I need the funds for?<br/><br/>Initial stock of books, gifts and packaging for the first run of boxes = £850<br/><br/>Initial stock of 3000 boxes (buying a large quantity so I can get them at the best price) = £1950<br/><br/>Welcome packs: Initial stock of membership cards, bookmarks, badges and bookbags for welcome packs, for new members of the club (and to send as ‘perks’ to other funders) = £450</p>
<p>Initial business expenses: registering as a bookseller; office supplies; laptop and website protection; initial consultation with an accountant; contingency funds = £900</p>
<p>Initial advertising/promotion = £350<br/></p>
</li> <li>'Fair enough,' I hear you say, 'but what do I get?'<br/><br/>Well, this is your chance to get one of the first boxes, and save money doing it! Simply choose the £15 perk and you'll be one of just 100 hundred people to receive The Joy Book Club's first ever box! Cue: Excitement! <br/>And if you want to order one as a Christmas Present for a loved one (excellent idea that, clever you!), I can send you a voucher so you have something to hand to them on the day!<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/><p></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">(Please Note: This is a sample version of a box to demonstrate what they will look like and contain)</span></div>Each box will contain a book, a hand-written letter about how I came to choose that book and a few gifts themed around it. <br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446396951/zcz0xh7cc3l6woz1vh78.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>So, for example if the book were Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason, the gifts might be some candy cigarettes, some tropical Thai incense sticks and </span>a 'I<span style=""background-color: initial;""> ❤️‍ wine' drink coaster; if the book were The Elephant Vanishes by Haruki Murakami, you might find some chocolates, a 'fresh-cut grass' scented candle and pull-tab bracelet. Obviously neither of those books will be one of my boxes - they're too well-known and I'll never reveal which books will be the boxes before they've been sent out. But you get the idea.<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>Or you can get a little The Joy Book Club merch, have a little perusal of the other perks, see if there's anything you fancy.<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/><div style=""text-align: center;"">

<div style=""text-align: center;""><p><i>""Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go."" - <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">T. S. Eliot</span></i></p></div> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I am new to the business world. Starting a business is always a risk, especially starting your first business. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">But I am so passionate about this. I really believe in this idea, I've done incredible amounts of research and have spent lots of time working on the idea and sourcing what I need to do this. I've signed up to Enterprise Nation to seek help and guidance with starting this business. I also went to The School of Communication Arts 2.0, which gives you all kinds of entrepreneurial and branding skills, and has an incredible, expansive network of mentors, so I got a good grounding in the things I need to know about doing this, and list as long as my arm (longer probably) of great, wise people who can help and give advice.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I also want to do this right in terms of being a responsible business that cares about the wider world. Therefore I am trying to source packaging that is as green as possible - and thoroughly encourage subscribers to recycle all their packaging once they've opened the box. </span></p>
<p>I am also pleased to announce our Read Books, Do Good charity initiative. £1 from each box will go to a different Rad Book-Charity of the Month, that will be in some way linked to the book/box's theme. I truly believe that books and reading play an important role in helping to solve some of society's, and the workd's, biggest problems. Thus simply by buying a box and reading an awesome book, you'll be doing some book-related good in the world. Lovely!</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This company is all about the Joy, so I want to include that in as many parts of the business, and spread it as far out to the wider world, as possible :-)<br/></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Epilogue: Sharing is Caring</h3> <p></p>

Now, there are lots of books we all should read. I personally recommend Murakami to everyone I get the chance to. And there are the classics: Jane Austen is a must; Dickens? Absolutely! George Orwell, I’d certainly say so.
But as good as the Gone Girls and Harry Potter’s of the world are, there’s hundreds, if not thousands, of wonderful books out there in the world that most people simply never come across.
And don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that Gone Girl and Harry Potter aren’t absolutely fantastic - and I, as a confirmed Ravenclaw, would certainly not wish to dissuade you from reading either. 
But I guess I’ve always been a big fan of being different. 
Whenever I discover a new book or author that I love, I am filled with such pure joy. Particularly when it's one that I only by chance stumbled across. Even more so if it involves a genre or topic I wouldn’t usually pick up that gets me out of my reading comfort zone.
There are so many hidden gem books out there. And I want to bring that feeling of finding that special, previously-unknown book to as many people as possible.
That’s why I am launching my business:  


A subscription box book club that will, each month, send out a delightfully packaged box to subscribers, containing one such above-mentioned book, along with some extra goodies, themed around that particular book, to really enhance the experience of reading it. Then we can all read and discuss the book and our experience with it via The Joy Book Club's website and social media. And, to ensure we #ShareTheBookJoy as much as possible, £1 from each box will go to different book-related charities each month! Lovely.


Sound like fun?
I am currently planning to send out my first round of boxes (those ordered through this campaign) at the end of January 2016 and open my online shop to subscriptions on February 1st 2016. (Subscriptions for the first box will also open early on the website from the beginning of December at the full price of £15.99 per box, as part of our pre-launch).
But to do that, I need a little help :-)

   Chapter One: The Breakdown 
""When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left I buy food and clothes."" - Desiderius Erasmus
Right folks, let's get down to the nitty-gritty:  
What do I need the funds for?Initial stock of books, gifts and packaging for the first run of boxes = £850Initial stock of 3000 boxes (buying a large quantity so I can get them at the best price) = £1950Welcome packs: Initial stock of membership cards, bookmarks, badges and bookbags for welcome packs, for new members of the club (and to send as ‘perks’ to other funders) = £450
Initial business expenses: registering as a bookseller; office supplies; laptop and website protection; initial consultation with an accountant; contingency funds = £900
Initial advertising/promotion = £350
 'Fair enough,' I hear you say, 'but what do I get?'Well, this is your chance to get one of the first boxes, and save money doing it! Simply choose the £15 perk and you'll be one of just 100 hundred people to receive The Joy Book Club's first ever box! Cue: Excitement! And if you want to order one as a Christmas Present for a loved one (excellent idea that, clever you!), I can send you a voucher so you have something to hand to them on the day!




(Please Note: This is a sample version of a box to demonstrate what they will look like and contain)Each box will contain a book, a hand-written letter about how I came to choose that book and a few gifts themed around it. 
So, for example if the book were Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason, the gifts might be some candy cigarettes, some tropical Thai incense sticks and a 'I ❤️‍ wine' drink coaster; if the book were The Elephant Vanishes by Haruki Murakami, you might find some chocolates, a 'fresh-cut grass' scented candle and pull-tab bracelet. Obviously neither of those books will be one of my boxes - they're too well-known and I'll never reveal which books will be the boxes before they've been sent out. But you get the idea.Or you can get a little The Joy Book Club merch, have a little perusal of the other perks, see if there's anything you fancy.
               (Designs subject to change - but they'll be something like this!)Or just donate a little (or a lot, up to you) to help me out, as the thoroughly lovely person you are.


 And if you don't reach your entire goal...?If I haven't reached my funding goal at the end of this campaign, I'll have to push my planned launch-date back whilst I gather the rest of the start-up funds I need to get things up and running. But I will still launch, it would just take a little longer... And who wants to wait for BookJoy?!
   Chapter Two: Risks & Responsibilities (the alternative R&R)
""Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go."" - T. S. Eliot I am new to the business world. Starting a business is always a risk, especially starting your first business. 
But I am so passionate about this. I really believe in this idea, I've done incredible amounts of research and have spent lots of time working on the idea and sourcing what I need to do this. I've signed up to Enterprise Nation to seek help and guidance with starting this business. I also went to The School of Communication Arts 2.0, which gives you all kinds of entrepreneurial and branding skills, and has an incredible, expansive network of mentors, so I got a good grounding in the things I need to know about doing this, and list as long as my arm (longer probably) of great, wise people who can help and give advice.
I also want to do this right in terms of being a responsible business that cares about the wider world. Therefore I am trying to source packaging that is as green as possible - and thoroughly encourage subscribers to recycle all their packaging once they've opened the box. 
I am also pleased to announce our Read Books, Do Good charity initiative. £1 from each box will go to a different Rad Book-Charity of the Month, that will be in some way linked to the book/box's theme. I truly believe that books and reading play an important role in helping to solve some of society's, and the workd's, biggest problems. Thus simply by buying a box and reading an awesome book, you'll be doing some book-related good in the world. Lovely!
This company is all about the Joy, so I want to include that in as many parts of the business, and spread it as far out to the wider world, as possible :-)   Epilogue: Sharing is Caring 
“Happiness quite unshared can scarcely be called happiness; it has no taste.” - Charlotte Brontë
If you can't help financially, no worries! There are other ways to help:

If you have any bookish friends who you think might like The Joy Book Club, you could suggest it to them instead.
Or you could, very kindly, just generally get the word out and make a bit of noise about The Joy Book Club and this campaign - Facebook, Twitter, actually speaking to people, however you feel like it. #ShareTheBookJoy!   And that, as they say, is: The End. :-)",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><strong><em>Lokala Studios: A creative and supportive retail outlet for local artisans, as well as a supportive entity for other local businesses, schools, and community programs! </em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi! My name is Erin Berger, and my goal is to raise money to aid in opening a retail space in my small town of LaSalle-Peru, Illinois. This store would be a special and tailored space where myself and other local artists could sell their handmade creations, including everything from art to crafting; furniture to music. I believe every artist should have the opportunity to grow support in their community, showcase their talent, and subsequentially increase their sales. At Lokala Studios, individual artists would have featured display areas, designed with their vision in mind. This will not be the kind of store customers enter and find the usual shelves and rows of product for sale. It will be a treat for the eyes and senses, creatively incorporating artists handmade goods and displaying their talent and hard work. Clean, uncluttered and unique displays means all creations can get equal grab appeal and the attention deserved by the customers. In addition to an artist friendly space, Lokala Studios will also be a parent and child friendly environment. A specific children's area will be set up, allowing caretakers to shop and visit while their children play.</p>
<p>I am the Owner/Designer of <a href=""http://www.krinklzbaby.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Krinklz Baby"">Krinklz Baby</a>. As a stay at home mom I was inspired to form a creative outlet and worked hard to start my own business creating handmade baby toys and accessories with a characteristic crinkly touch. I am passionate about providing a retail space that treats every artist's creations as though they are the store's main attraction.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There has been a shift: in the economy, in people's values, in the way people think about what they purchase. Focus has shifted back to family and community, supporting and helping each other.</p>
<p>Lokala Studios will purchase from local businesses and enlist the help of local carpenters/contractors to create the perfect space. This project is heavily invested in the artists involved, giving them every opportunity to take their passions to the next level through monthly features, creative marketing and bringing their vision to life. Lokala would also offer special fundraising opportunities for local schools, special creative workshops for all ages, and guest artist features.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am determined to open Lokala Studios. Local artists would carry their handmade creations in the store on consignment. This eliminates the need for funding for inventory. The funding is needed for start up costs. I have found a wonderful and open space to rent, and need to be able to provide a security deposit as well as know the first one or two months of rent are covered. Building unique diplay elements, purchasing fixtures for displays, and the workshop space are also required. Other initial costs include items such as point of sale equipment and software, packaging/sales materials, and local advertising. The majority of funds needed to open Lokala Studios exists in the beginning, and this is where I need help.</p>
<p>If I am not able to reach my goal of $5000, I will simply have to be more frugal and creative with how to spend the money that is raised. At this point there is no other funding available, but I am confident that one way or another this store will get off the ground with diligence and passion.</p>
<p>Any monetary support that can be offered will be greatly appreciated by myself, the local artists involved, and the Illinois Valley community. A list of all contributers will be posted in the store, as well as supplied to each artist involved. There will be five random drawings from contributer names and those selected will receive a handmade treat from Lokala Studios. Thank you in advance for your support!</p>

I believe every artist should have the opportunity to grow support in their community, showcase their talent, and subsequentially increase their sales. At Lokala Studios, individual artists would have featured display areas, designed with their vision in mind. This will not be the kind of store customers enter and find the usual shelves and rows of product for sale. It will be a treat for the eyes and senses, creatively incorporating artists handmade goods and displaying their talent and hard work. Clean, uncluttered and unique displays means all creations can get equal grab appeal and the attention deserved by the customers. In addition to an artist friendly space, Lokala Studios will also be a parent and child friendly environment. A specific children's area will be set up, allowing caretakers to shop and visit while their children play.
I am the Owner/Designer of Krinklz Baby. As a stay at home mom I was inspired to form a creative outlet and worked hard to start my own business creating handmade baby toys and accessories with a characteristic crinkly touch. I am passionate about providing a retail space that treats every artist's creations as though they are the store's main attraction.


The Impact
There has been a shift: in the economy, in people's values, in the way people think about what they purchase. Focus has shifted back to family and community, supporting and helping each other.
Lokala Studios will purchase from local businesses and enlist the help of local carpenters/contractors to create the perfect space. This project is heavily invested in the artists involved, giving them every opportunity to take their passions to the next level through monthly features, creative marketing and bringing their vision to life. Lokala would also offer special fundraising opportunities for local schools, special creative workshops for all ages, and guest artist features.
 
What We Need & What You Get


I am determined to open Lokala Studios. Local artists would carry their handmade creations in the store on consignment. This eliminates the need for funding for inventory. The funding is needed for start up costs. I have found a wonderful and open space to rent, and need to be able to provide a security deposit as well as know the first one or two months of rent are covered. Building unique diplay elements, purchasing fixtures for displays, and the workshop space are also required. Other initial costs include items such as point of sale equipment and software, packaging/sales materials, and local advertising. The majority of funds needed to open Lokala Studios exists in the beginning, and this is where I need help.
If I am not able to reach my goal of $5000, I will simply have to be more frugal and creative with how to spend the money that is raised. At this point there is no other funding available, but I am confident that one way or another this store will get off the ground with diligence and passion.
Any monetary support that can be offered will be greatly appreciated by myself, the local artists involved, and the Illinois Valley community. A list of all contributers will be posted in the store, as well as supplied to each artist involved. There will be five random drawings from contributer names and those selected will receive a handmade treat from Lokala Studios. Thank you in advance for your support!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Geanie, age 57, and my husband is Roger, age 59.  We have 3 wonderful grandchildren that we adore, and spoil.  We are homebodies, mostly because Roger isn't quite the same since recovering from stage 4 cancer, and I suffer from congenital spinal stenois, so I can't walk or stand any length of time.  But we don't mind, we love being together and we are always available to keep the grandkids.  Roger hasn't worked in over a year now since his cancer treatments left him unable to continue his commercial insulator job.  I am in IT and my job has been outsourced 3 times now. I am currently working part-time on an as needed basis.  But we make things work and get our bills paid, including still paying on medical bills for Rogers treatments.  We've always done our best to be good people and help others when we could, but now, we need some help. <br/><br/>Our home that we both love to spend time together in has been broken. The City of Broken Arrow, in its attempt to alleviate flooding in 2 newly developed neighborhoods behind us, diverted the flood waters onto our property. This diversion of the flood waters was done mid Oct, 2007, during the time between when our offer on the home had been accepted and when we  closed, and continued until Jan of this year when they finally installed a real storm drainage system. But even when a City knows they caused damage to one's home,  you have to file a claim in order to have the City pay for the damages. We did. It's been 18 months now since filing. In June the City asked us to submit a settlement proposal. We asked for the exact cost of the repairs. We obtained multiple estimates and provided them all to the City. The final total estimate (averaged from the multiple estimates) is over $98,000. Our offer went before the City Council this week, they rejected it with no counter offer. They want to go to trial. Pre-trial is set for Oct. 1. <br/>We hae already spent almost $5000 and We don't have the additional $20-25k dollars it will cost to go to trial. If we don't go to trial, our only other option is to drop the claim. Then the City pays nothing to repair what they did, and we will continue to live in a very badly broken home the rest of our lives. We need help in raising the $20-25,000 so we can go to trial. It's the only way we can get the City to pay for the repairs our home so desperately needs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds will be used to pay all the costs associated with going to trial. We have 9 witnesses, in addition to Roger and I, that are neighbors, friends and family. We have experts, 2 structural engineers, an appraiser, and every one of the contractors that submitted repair estimates. The City has notified us that in order to go to trial, they want depositions from everyone. That's a lot of people, and at a cost of $250 per hour for our attorney to first spend time with each witness to prepare them for their depositions. And another $250 per hour when he attends each persons deposition and for time spent otherwise preparing for trial and for the trial itself. That's a lot of money. We also need to be able to pay our experts, for their time. The City will pay them their normal hourly rate for their time giving their depostions, but we have to pay for our attorney to prepare them for their depositions, and also for their time spent being at the trial.</p>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, we will use whatever amount of funds we do get for the same purposes as stated. Our attorney wants to work with us, but he can't spend hours upon hours for us for nothing. So if we can get enough to keep him at least happy, we might make it to trial on less. But if the amount of funds is too far from our goal, we will use the funds to make as many repairs as we ourselves possibly can. Such as getting our windwos and doors sealed off since they simply won't close all the way. or sealing all the cracks on the outside brick walls. There are plenty of repairs to do that any amount would help. But we hope to be able to raise enough to go to court and have the City fix what they broke and all repairs get done.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Wanna talk about an impact. Roger and I bought our dream house. And within 6 months, it all began. The rains and the damages.  We live in NE Oklahoma, the soil here is clay based. When clay gets wet, it swells. The City put so much water on us, the soil swelled and lifted the outside brick walls up off it's piers/foundation. Our home has a crawl space, it's up on inner piers. We have pictures of those inner piers, showing as much as 4 inches of diverted water has passed under our home. This cause all 14 <br/>inner piers to shift, tip, fall over, and the subfloor insulation to suck up the moisture in the air from it and fall, and the subfloor to warp. All the floors in our home have to be completely removed and a new subfloor and floors have to be build. Our concrete 2 car garage was raised 3 inches and all the dirt beneath has been washed away. Our garage is sitting on a sink hole. <br/>We haven't parked our vehicles in there for 3 years now. Walls have pulled away from our fireplace, as well as from our kitchen counters and cabinets. The picture I uploaded shows where the floor and walls have been pulled apart. I have so many picures to show, but can only upload one. Windows won't close and doors jam and are hard to open, others won't stay closed. There isn't a single room without cracks in the walls, huge cracks. We can stand in the kitchen and see the dining room through the wall.  This was our dream home and it's been such a nightmare. Watching it break, piece by piece. We are on just over 1/3 acre and it had no flowers or anything. As soon as we moved in, I put up a white picket fence in the front, planted rose bushes and several other perennial flowers. The fence isn't straight any more and almost all plants died from root rot. We had one of those<br/>wooden fort swing sets for our grandkids. We have never been able to put it up because the ground stayed too wet and it would sink. I have had many a crying spell watching all this happening, for over 4 years. I could go on and on. But, the flooding problem has been fixed and our property is drying out. Now we want our home fixed, put back the way it was. We want to enjoy <br/>our home. Your help will allow us to do that. Without your help, all we can do is walk away. The City knows they did this,  they even admitted it to me over the phone in the very beginning. But then wouldn't talk to me any longer after this went on and on and I called to report more damages. They only rejected our reasonable settlement offer, and are requiring so many depositions to bully us financially so we drop the case and they walk away without having to fix what they broke. Your helping us be able to go to trial makes a HUGE step for all citizens who can't afford to fight for something that should just happen as a matter of common respect and responsibility and you would help us get our home, our dream home, back. And then I <br/>can plant my roses and flowers and we can enjoy our home once again.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We know that not everyonoe can contribute to our funding needs. We have made regular contributions to non-profits for years,  but with that has happened to us over the past 4 years, we are no longer able to. So we certainly understand.</p>
<p>But, you can still help by getting the word out to your family, friends and co-workers. Remember, you can use the Indiegogo share tools. Let everyone know we need help from bullying city attorneys who are trying to force us to drop our case simply because we don't have the money to go to trial. They are doing this because they know if we go to trial, they will lose. <br/>THANK YOU ALL FOR CONTRIBUTING FUNDS AND / OR PASSING THE WORD. We Truly appreciate it and God Bless You All</p>

<p><strong><em> </em> MY STORY:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>An Ependymoma (tumor) was found in my lumbar spine.<strong> </strong>The<em> </em>neurosurgeon told<strong> <em> </em></strong>me that<em> </em>after the surgery I came very close to being paralyzed but luckily I<strong>  </strong>managed to walk again and still undergoing radiation and physical therapy 3-5 times a week. </p>
<p>I became severely and profoundly deaf due to a degenerative condition that was caused by a drug interaction called Ototoxicity after hospitalization. And since i am required MRI scans each year they denied me for the Colhear implant because you cannot have any metal inside the body with the MRI . Having said that my insurance will not cover my hearing aids either because i've reached the age limit in my state :( although i look younger :) they don't care :(  </p>
<p><strong>(</strong>Ototoxic Medications includes antibiotics, chemotherapy and anti-inflammatory type drugs.Ototoxicity affects nearly 120,000 people in the U.S. each year, most of whom are either older persons receiving treatment for cancer, or children undergoing treatment for bacterial sepsis or cancer but save lives at the expense of hearing.<strong>)</strong> </p>
<p>REFERENCE: <a href=""http://deafness.about.com/od/ototoxicity/a/ototoxic.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://deafness.about.com/od/ototoxicity/a/otot...</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><em>Pam Anger, Au.D. Doctor of Audiology at Penn Medicine wrote back to me saying: </em></p>
<p><em>''You would need another hearing test (has to be within 6 months of getting a new hearing aid). That would be billed to your health insurance. We would need a doctor’s order (can be written as “consult to audiology” on a prescription pad).

<p><strong>WHY AM I REACHING OUT FOR HELP?</strong></p>
<p>I don't have any credit or any resources at the moment and having been on my own since 15, my parents can't help me either and was hoping this site would help me some after seeing ''Karen the bus driver'' raised $703,873 to go on vacation...</p>

</div></div>","MY STORY:
 An Ependymoma (tumor) was found in my lumbar spine. The neurosurgeon told  me that after the surgery I came very close to being paralyzed but luckily I  managed to walk again and still undergoing radiation and physical therapy 3-5 times a week. 
I became severely and profoundly deaf due to a degenerative condition that was caused by a drug interaction called Ototoxicity after hospitalization. And since i am required MRI scans each year they denied me for the Colhear implant because you cannot have any metal inside the body with the MRI . Having said that my insurance will not cover my hearing aids either because i've reached the age limit in my state :( although i look younger :) they don't care :(  
(Ototoxic Medications includes antibiotics, chemotherapy and anti-inflammatory type drugs.Ototoxicity affects nearly 120,000 people in the U.S. each year, most of whom are either older persons receiving treatment for cancer, or children undergoing treatment for bacterial sepsis or cancer but save lives at the expense of hearing.) 
REFERENCE: http://deafness.about.com/od/ototoxicity/a/otot... 
 
 Pam Anger, Au.D. Doctor of Audiology at Penn Medicine wrote back to me saying: 
''You would need another hearing test (has to be within 6 months of getting a new hearing aid). That would be billed to your health insurance. We would need a doctor’s order (can be written as “consult to audiology” on a prescription pad). We would also schedule you for a Hearing Aid Assessment, which is a 90 minute appointment where I do further testing of your comfort levels and we would discuss all of your options as far as hearing aids. There is a $200 charge for that appointment and it is not billable to insurance. You are not a candidate for the SoundLens IIC – it would not be powerful enough. Starkey does make power CIC’s, so the X series 110 CIC is an option. Our price would be $3,200 and comes with a 3 yr warranty. We do not have payment plans, but you can put it on a credit card.

<h3>Help us <em>Raise the Barcode</em>!</h3>
<p>Tuscaloosa's own <a href=""http://www.thelefthand.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Left Hand Soap Company</a> is ready to raise the barcode and be a grown up corporate monster...without all the monster stuff, and with more soap.  Help us raise the funds to have an official company code with *official* barcodes that can help us in our plan for world domination one pound of natural soap at a time.  This would give us the ability to continue to grow as a Tuscaloosa business that will, as always, turn around and give back to the community we love so much.  Let's take the next step together.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To get a series of barcodes, we must buy a UPC prefix.  We have to get that from the official holder of UPC prefixes, GS1.  Waaaay back in the mid-1970's, GS1 introduced UPC codes and made it their mission to unite businesses with each other.  Now, we can't work without them.  They seem nice enough; but we get what we pay for - so we have to pay well.  Introductory dues and fees are a bit over $1,500.  After that, building and printing the UPCs for our packaging [with modifications and sizing] takes us up to $3,000, all said and done.  If we raise more than that, we'll dedicate it to making the transition *even better* with upgrades to our packaging and more time spent with local graphic artists, local farmers and charity organizations - enriching our already amazing soap.</p>
</li>
<li>We want to make you proud, Alabama.  We want to grow and continue to partner with local businesses and sponsor local arts and community events.  Whether it's Bama Art House films like ""Turn Me On, Dammit"", local community projects, schools, bands, community charity organizations or local theatre performances - we want to bring more attention to the region, do more cool things and hang out with more of you.</li>
<li>
<p>How can you help?  Cold, hard cash...and support. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To celebrate making our goal - fingers crossed - we'll make a custom batch of celebratory soap called ""Look Ma, Barcodes!""  What'll be in it?  Great question.  What would YOU like to see in it?!</p>
</li>
<li>Also, we'll be printing a special edition TLH sticker and tshirt for the occasion. <br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we *don't* reach our goal, that's ok.  We'll keep going and keep up the barcode work.  We'll go as far as it takes us.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't have any spare change floating around?  No worries - we love you, too.  You can help by spreading the word.  Share this page - tell your friends...tell your other friends...tell your enemies.  Spread the word so we can keep doing what we do...only better!</li>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>We are a small group of moms who came together around the idea of getting hot meals out there to folks. <a href=""http://www.zoesbook.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Zoe Adlersberg</a>, a photographer, Erin Wile, a producer, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/sarakategr"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Sara Kate Gillingham-Ryan</a>, founder of <a href=""http://www.thekitchn.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">thekitchn.com</a> and cookbook author, are spearheading the efforts.

<div>
<ul>
<li>With food trucks, we can get into affected areas and be flexible. Is there an immediate need in Coney Island? Canarsie? We'll get there. In the Rockaways? In Red Hook? We are mobile and can get meals to folks who need them. Power out, can't cook? We can supply HOT meals for communities that are hurt. Power on now but spirits low? What's better to say ""I'm with you!!"" as rebuilding continues than a free, delicious, hot meal cooked with love.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Food trucks can serve 500+ people for $2,500 a day, cost per meal is $5!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Depending on the funds we raise, we'd like to make a steady push, sending trucks into the field 1-2 per week UNTIL JANUARY 1. The idea is that this is a LONG HAUL, not a quick fix.<br/><br/>

<li>All money will go DIRECTLY to the trucks for their food/fuel costs minus Indigogo's fee. There is no overhead and no one else is being paid a cent to help with the fundraising. We are doing this because we believe in what we are doing!</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is 2 trucks, 2 days a week ever week (so 4 trucks a week) from next week until Jan 31st, 2012 with 2 additional days on Thanksgiving and Christmas (2 trucks on those days). If we raise more, we'll do more!!</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal we will get as many trucks as we can in the field and focus on current needs and Thanksgiving.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact is huge. From the smile on the child's face when ordering a burrito the way she likes it, to an elderly person getting some hot food they need. The trucks turn into a social club too, people congregating around food, catching up, sharing their stories. Food is an amazing thing.</p>

<h3>Ms. Jan's Story</h3>
<p>I have lived life as ""a journey, not a destination, which has given me the resolve to always be open to My purpose and all of the possibilities that the Universe has bestowed on me. A widow and mother of 3 men, who have also followed their passions and ""when given the choice to sit it out or dance"", they choose to dance. This makes me proud ! My ""heart sings"" because I have passionatly embraced and participated in those valiant efforts that have brought us to this place where we all can be creative and passionate about contributing to man-kind in awesome ways. My total dedication and awesome creativity has allowed me to give birth to ""Ms. Jan's Creamy White Hot Sauce.   My goal is to bring this epicurian delight to everyone and continue to ""Share the Experience""! Made with a traditional Texas flavor and a secret blend of Caribbean spices, this incredible all-purpose condiment, can be used for any dish, as a marinate for fish; dipping sauce for chips, veggies or wraps;salad dressing or simply as a delightful compliment to any dish you want to ""pump up a notch"", giving the perfect spice without overwhelming your dish. Everyone who has ever experienced the sauce and I mean EVERYONE, unanamously agree that ""Ms. Jan's Creamy White Hot Sauce""is a phenomenal and there is nothing like it in the Gourmet Market Place. I don't know about that! What I do know for sure is that: It is a perfect gift to me and with this gift comes the responsibility to Share this Amazing product. I have many ""stories"" about my journey but the most recent involves this leg of My journey. I am always open to leads, suggestions, advice,etc. and i always follow-up. A industry insider suggested that I meet with Rosemary Goodman, Manager of the Gourmet Market in the World Trade Center. I called and explained that I wanted info on the National Fancy Food Show and she made an appointment with me, cautioning me that ""she didn't like HOT. I met her with no anticipation of her ""loving"" the sauce. We had a very infomative talk and she took me on a tour of the showroom. When we resumed our talk and she ""examined"" the very impressive bottles of sauce, she went to her refrigerator and got a cracker. She opened the sauce and poured a little on the cracker and began to cough profusely. she returned to the refrigerator with a bottle of water and some more crackers. (i was stunned and guilty but, knew I had not encouraged her). After eating several crackers with the sauce; coughing then chasing with water, she offered me a permanent booth in the Gourmet Market,which guarenteed my participation in the June Gourmet Food and Gift Market. This gave me the experience and connections with other vendors all who have been invaluable contacts and collegues on this journey! We are working with a Local, family owned maunfacturer to produce product to fill all of the orders we got during the show. This experience is the beginning of the next ""leg"" of my journey !

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Welcome all, Ladies and Gentlemen, to this land of lost scents and untold legends!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our story began back in May 2012 when we decided to create a whole new aspect in Steampunk art: Candles and Cosmetics.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Would you join us on this adventure?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Matt grew up in a family dedicated body and soul to the art of hairdressing; he saw how cosmetic products were evolving away from their natural roots forcing us to use more and more chemicals every day; that's when we said stop!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lovers of ecological products and Steampunk style, we decided to create together a new line of natural cosmetics with Steampunk inspiration.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The aromas we use are special, lost scents in time, dreaming with every breath you take! Mixed drop by drop with hints of fantasy and vintage!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s1.netizate.com/~thelost/Indiegogo/Aromas.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Apart from that, our next target after fulfilling the cosmetic needs, will be to show you our magnificent Steampunk candles.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s1.netizate.com/~thelost/Indiegogo/Candles_All.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each one of our candle designs is unique, made by Matt's own hands, directly out of his imagination; nobody else have them and they are as elegant as cute!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Want to know more? Just check below. :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s1.netizate.com/~thelost/Indiegogo/Cosmetics_Banner_EN.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>For this 1st Phase, our range of cosmetics will cover 4 of the total 8 aromas, which will be:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s1.netizate.com/~thelost/Indiegogo/Scents4in1_EN.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you liked the aromas, then you can't miss the products themselves!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>- <strong>Rose hip oil solid soap</strong> (Victorian Garden) - 100gr (regular size) / 50gr (travel size)</div>
<div>- <strong>Almonds oil solid soap</strong> (Flying over the desert) - 100gr (regular size) / 50gr (travel size)</div>
<div>- <strong>Rice bran oil solid soap </strong>(Letters from far away) - 100gr (regular size) / 50gr (travel size)</div>
<div>-<strong> Pistachio oil solid soap </strong>(Clean those gears) - 100gr (regular size) / 50gr (travel size)</div>
<div>- <strong>The 8th Wonder solid Shampoo</strong> (all 4 aromas available) - 100gr (regular size) / 50gr (travel size)</div>
<div>- <strong>Shaving solid soap</strong> (2 aromas available, TBA) - 100gr (regular size) / 50gr (travel size)</div>
<div>- <strong>Scrub solid soap</strong> (Coffee) - 100gr (regular size) / 50gr (travel size)</div>
<div>- <strong>Aftershave solid lotion</strong> (all 4 aromas available) - 100gr (regular size) / No travel size available at the moment</div>
<div>- <strong>Lip balm</strong> (4 tastes, TBA) - 7gr (regular size)</div>
<div>- <strong>Body butter</strong> (all 4 aromas available) - 100gr (regular size) / No travel size available at the moment</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We will soon also offer Bathroom and Shaving accesories.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our idea for the packaging is the following (for regular soaps and shampoos)</div>

<div> </div>
<div>A lot of people have done candle holders before with Steampunk design but we couldn't find anyone making actual Steampunk decorative candles; so we thought: Let's do it!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It all started with a simple Top hat, but it went way over our expectations. We are continuously working on new creations to increase our selection of unique items.</div>

<div>As an addition to the cosmetic and decorative candles, we will also offer three types of aromatherapy candles; made with 100% vegan and ecological soy wax to Meditation&amp;Relax, Inspiration&amp;Imagination and Happiness&amp;Positivity.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
The project will be funded in three steps as shown in the contributions tracker on the top, the total amount needed is of 22.150€ ($29,590/£18,462)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Step 1 (Cosmetics 1st Batch - First 4 aromas) -&gt; 9.500€ ($12,690/£7,920)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Raw materials + basic packaging: 7.500€</li>
<li>Rest of packaging: 500€</li>
<li>Licenses*: 1.700€</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; Office material: 275€</li>
<li>Indiegogo + Paypal commissions</li>
</ul>
<p>*Licenses include the registration of the cosmetic products (each change to the product requires an additional license) plus the legal licenses of the shop itself.</p>
<p>*We already received a private funding of 1.700€, which has already been deducted from the total requested.</p>
<p>Step 2 (Cosmetics 2nd Batch - Next 4 aromas) -&gt; 8.850€ ($11,820/£7,377)</p>
<p>Step 3 (Candles) -&gt; 3.800€ ($5,075/£3,170)</p>

<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The project will not only help rebuilding the natural cosmetic usage around the globe but also small shops here in Europe which can resell the products to their clients locally and renew themselves. Examples of this are the following:</p>
<p>""Celebrating the 60th anniversary of its foundation, Friseur Kellner-Wallner [owned by Matt's mother] is proud to become the first hairdressing salon to be using and reselling these new and very special products"" <em>Friseur Kellner-Wallner in Mank (Austria) <a href=""http://www.kellner-wallner.at/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kellner-wallner.at/</a></em></p>
<p>""I started using natural cosmetics to avoid touching parabens constantly. As an occasional user parabens might not affect you that drastically, but as a Beautician or Hairdresser, we are all in danger of leukemia or abortions caused by all these chemicals. Also last week I showed in my blog how dangerous are some commercial lipsticks, full of lead; so I am definitely sticking now to Natural Cosmetics."" Tamara Ulric, <em>Beautician and Blogger in Chipiona (Spain).</em> <a href=""http://eressbella.blogspot.com.es/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>http://eressbella.blogspot.com.es/</em></a></p>
