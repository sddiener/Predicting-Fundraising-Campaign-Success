<h3>""Who Are you fools?!""</h3>
<p>Shattered Glass is a conductorless string orchestra based out of New York City. Virtuosic and versatile, SG balances vibrant excitement with a meticulous respect for piece, composer, and tradition. With a repertoire that ranges from Bach, Britten, and Bartok, to Schoenberg, and Stravinsky, SG also offers innovative programming and collaborations with Grammy-award winning pop artists. At the core of SG is a commitment to the special relationship it creates between audience and ensemble. By performing without a conductor and tailoring each performance with exceptional attention to audience and venue, listeners can't help but experience a connection with every one of the musicians. Barriers typical of the classical music experience are, well, shattered! </p>

<p>Guitarist Django Reinhardt was a Gypsy born in Belgium, who spent most of his adult life in France. While in Paris, in the thirties, Django heard the music of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, and set out to emulate it. He ended up creating a uniquely beautiful, rhythmically driven genre of music that has been emulated all of the world. Today, Django's style of playing is known as Gypsy Jazz.</p>
<p>The Brooklyn Djangology Festival was created to celebrate to celebrate Django's Legacy. We have hosted 4 of these festivals in the past. All have sold out. This year, though, it has an additional calling.</p>
<p>Coney Island Hospital and Bellevue Hospital, two of New York City's major public hospitals, were evacuated as a result of Hurricane Sandy. Bellevue is New York City's oldest full-service hospital, and the oldest continuously operating hospital in America. Coney Island Hospital services South Brooklyn, much of which was damaged by flooding from the storm. Extensive work needs to be done to repair the damage done by the hurricane, and make both hospitals safe for patients.<br/><br/> HHC's mission is to provide high quality care to all patients regardless of ability to pay, and as such, services patients from all over the city and from all backgrounds, ranging from artists and musicians to victims of torture. Brooklyn Djangology will be combining music's powers of healing and celebration in service of Hurricane Sandy's victims all over New York City.</p>
<p>Your contribution would ensure that we are able to cover the expenses of hosting this event, thus maximizing our contribution the city's public hospitals, and to families in need. Our goal is to donate all of the money from ticket sales to HHC. Our wish is to support both the musicians and to alleviate the strain on New York City.</p>

<h3><em>I want to use this gift of music to give a voice and a presence in the global community to a reality that is often unseen: a prosperous Africa.</em></h3>
<p>Africa can groom and raise successful and gifted kids. I want to offer the visibility of that success because I recognize how much younger kids today get educated by what they hear and see on TV. Their bias and preferences are shaped by what TV shows or doesn’t show. With the platform that we have today, we have the responsibility to tell another story about Africa, one that doesn’t always involve misery and neediness. As real as misery is, it doesn’t bring the best out of us. Successful and inspiring stories on the other hand do inspire people to invest. People only invest when they feel good about themselves, about others, and about where we’re going as a species.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><em>I want to spread the art form of Jazz into a more widespread audience.</em></h3>
<p>Jazz has always had a black audience and the upper class white audience. It hasn’t been mainstream for a good while because it hasn’t traveled very much beyond its traditional boundaries. Touring extensively continents like Asia, the Middle East, South America, and Africa with this art form will be a game changer because it will introduce jazz to a brand new crowd and therefore increase the popularity and earning power of this art form. Asia for instance is currently experiencing an economic boom like no other region in the world today. People there are dying for new experiences and innovation. I hope to take this art form there and give them something worth their money, time, and energy.</p>

<p>Greetings from  Sunday wilde, in a very small town set in the wilderness of Northern Ontario. I am a self taught piano player , vocalist and songwriter, and I am currently working on my fourth album. I write jazz blues and something that lays on the edge of both of those genres. </p>
My last album   “What man? Oh THAT man!!” was very successful as it:·   </div>
<ul>
<li>Hit the top 100 Blues albums of 2011 on theRoots Music Report (Itnl)·  </li>
<li>Won Best International Blues Release on blues411·   </li>
<li>Runner up for the Best Acoustic Blues Album of the Year on Wasser Prawda    </li>
<li>Nominated Album of the Year Solo Artist for the Northern Ontario Music &amp; Film Awards·    </li>
<li>Won Best Blues Song of the year Voters Choice for the Independent Music Awards (Itnl)</li>
</ul><div>
<p>Some words from reviewers:</p>
·        “wilde rips apart the fragile emotional wake oflove from dawn to dusk” W. Haskell, No Depression·        “Ms. Wilde shakes, rattles, glides and purrsacross the landscape.” D. McCloskey, The Alternate Root·        “Wildes own unique voice mixes sweet innocence witha dusky raspy edge that conjures up images of Early Ethel Waters and SisterRosetta Tharpe” The American Blues Blog
<p>This new project will consist of almost 22 new origina lsongs some jazzy some bluesy some a bit on the edge of both of those genres.  Most excitedly I have dreamt of recording an album in a wilderness cabin surrounded by the wilderness where I live. Most artists dream of going to Nashville or to Memphis to record, but I want to record in the wilderness, close to where I have raised my two sons and close to where I live. This experience will be unencumbered by television and the city noise, where the artists can come together and work for a week. We will be there just in time to enjoy the fall colours and evade the mosquitoes!! We may not end up recording all 22 new tracks, depending on how it all comes together, but there is certainly enough new material to select from.</p>
<p>I have contacted  musicians to come in on the project to lend their creative juices to help me create the sound – a clarinet player, upright jazz bass player, guitarist, and an accordion player.  Some from the area, and others from southern Ontario. It will be certainly an interesting sound using clarinet and accordion on some blues boogie songs.</p>
<p>We visited the lodge recently and low and behold I discovered that the owners have an old upright honky tonk piano in the main lodge, so part of the funds will be used to bring in a piano tuner to see if we can get it sounding up to snuff for a recording.</p>
<p>I am so pleased that Branch’s Seine River Lodge <a href=""http://www.seineriverlodge.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.seineriverlodge.com</a> has generously offered the use of one of their cabins on the banks of Seine River for one week to record. The owners are passionate arts supporters and they even offered a fish fry after the recording is done! This will be an ideal serene location to create, mesh, meld, play, sing and record.</p>
<p>In order to do this, there are a few expenses involved:</p>
<p>·        Musician fees</p>
<p>·        Engineering and Technical Assistants</p>
<p>·        Mastering</p>
<p>·        Travel for the musicians which includes gas andflights for some</p>
<p>·        Food for the week for 6-8 people</p>
<p>·        Wages for a cook as I am sure I will be very busy</p>
<p>·        artwork, cd pressing, promotion and a radio campaign</p>
<p>Anything you can give towards the project will be great! If you cannot give financially perhaps you can share this with your email list of friends or on facebook or twitter.</p>
<p>For CANADIAN Residents only</p>
<p>One way of supporting the project without actually giving any money towards it is by opening an ING Bank Account, when you do if you useby Orange Key #26876920S1, ING, God bless them, will put $50 in myaccount ($25 after August 31st) and also give you $50 as part of their friend referral program. I thought I might take advantage of this for my album fundraising. <a href=""http://www.ingdirect.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ingdirect.ca</a> is the link.</p>
<p>Note for the blueberry jam lovers; I will be picking berries over the next month and hoping the crop will be good this year, but if it isn’t the jam perk will be in very limited quantities. If the bears give me any kind of trouble I may have to substitute the jam flavour.</p>
<p>Note for the Executive Producer Perk – There may be long term royalties involved in this perk, so we can discuss this, or if you have questions please feel free to email me.</p>
<p>If you are unable to give towards this project, I urge you to please go SEE LIVE MUSIC. It helps build a community of artists, supports local business and is just plain good to get away from the television and see people.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Midi Steamboat as I'm sure many of you know was the band that Paul and I started back in 2010. Since the first show we've played a handful of other on-campus shows and recorded an EP and part of a full-length. As we have since graduated from college and don't know when the next time we'll even play a show is, let alone see each other. This T-shirt was designed by me and is meant to give something back to all of those who actually came to our shows and supported us. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Basically the main issue we have here is that making T-shirts can be expensive. I've opted to run the whole operation myself, creating my own screen, buying blank shirts, and printing them myself. This allows us to cater better to a realistic number of customers and gives all of you a discount on actual cost of the shirt. The funding will be solely used for purchasing supplies. </p>
<p>The $500 goal is the minimum for a project, but we honestly don't need nearly that much. We've opted for Flexible Funding so we still get a large chunk of the funds raised if we don't make it to $500. If for whatever reason we don't make enough to fund the materials with just donations I will make every effort to push the rest out of my own pocket. <strong>I promise that anyone who pays for a t-shirt will get one. If we can't get enough funding right away we might have to push the expected delivery date but I will make it happen even if it's just one person. </strong></p>
<p>This campaign is essentially existing as a sort of good-faith pre-ordering system. If you support us now in setup you will guarantee yourself a t-shirt. The cost is reflective of materials and shipping for those who live outside of the Chicagoland area. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Those who are contributing are helping us with one of the final stages of Midi Steamboat. I can say that I personally loved every moment of Midi Steamboat, from the first night when we wrote ""I Like Riding Steamboats"" in Paul's apartment to our final show at Ringling College. You'll be helping us provide the few and proud die-hard fans with something to cherish from the band as well as help carry on the memory of the band forever. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word, share the music, tell your friends! It's never too late to be a Midi Steamboat fan. </p>

<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>First of all, thank you SO much for visiting this page family &amp; friends!  Now for the story behind why you are even on this page in the first place...</strong></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>I had a source of income that was to be used for recording and creating a new music video, and unfortunately I lost most of that when I got laid off from my job.  I scrambled around trying to find other ways to fund the project, and I did find a great way to earn all the money I need.  Unfortunately, it didn't work and sent me back to the drawing board.  Business loans are not an option as banks almost never lend to Record Labels, much less an artist.  Personal loans are impossible without employment.  Selling high value items are not really an option either, as I found out, because I have high value items no one wants but me.  Also, my royalities from the ""Satisfy You"" EP won't come in for another 6 months.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Which is why I am reaching out through IndieGoGo.com and attempting to crowdfund my music with your help.  This amount of money can and will literally make my dream become a reality.  Allow me to explain...</strong></span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>First, this started with one single song I was going to write and sell on my website to raise money for an album.  Then somehow one song turned into four more and now I have an entire EP.  I spent an entire week writing non-stop (throwing most of it out), barely eating, going to bed when the sun came up every morning, and I literally dreamt about writing music in my sleep.  I was relentless about breaking all of my musical boundaries and writing the best damn chart-topping material I could... all in less than one week.  I did it.  And I'm really <em>really</em> proud of these songs I wrote all by myself.  In fact, I was so stunned after I finished the demo for ""Live In the Dream"" that I had tears welling up in my eyes.  I knew in that moment, I had just written the song that would change my entire life.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>

First of all, thank you SO much for visiting this page family & friends!  Now for the story behind why you are even on this page in the first place...
 
I had a source of income that was to be used for recording and creating a new music video, and unfortunately I lost most of that when I got laid off from my job.  I scrambled around trying to find other ways to fund the project, and I did find a great way to earn all the money I need.  Unfortunately, it didn't work and sent me back to the drawing board.  Business loans are not an option as banks almost never lend to Record Labels, much less an artist.  Personal loans are impossible without employment.  Selling high value items are not really an option either, as I found out, because I have high value items no one wants but me.  Also, my royalities from the ""Satisfy You"" EP won't come in for another 6 months.
Which is why I am reaching out through IndieGoGo.com and attempting to crowdfund my music with your help.  This amount of money can and will literally make my dream become a reality.  Allow me to explain...
 
First, this started with one single song I was going to write and sell on my website to raise money for an album.  Then somehow one song turned into four more and now I have an entire EP.  I spent an entire week writing non-stop (throwing most of it out), barely eating, going to bed when the sun came up every morning, and I literally dreamt about writing music in my sleep.  I was relentless about breaking all of my musical boundaries and writing the best damn chart-topping material I could... all in less than one week.  I did it.  And I'm really really proud of these songs I wrote all by myself.  In fact, I was so stunned after I finished the demo for ""Live In the Dream"" that I had tears welling up in my eyes.  I knew in that moment, I had just written the song that would change my entire life.

I got into the studio with a producer.  He's worked with artists such as Shakira, Timbaland, Jason Durelo, and Miley Cyrus.  I've worked with him on recording, mixing and mastering my vocals before, and the man is a freakin' genius!!  Matt knows how to get that radio-ready sound faster than anyone I've ever seen.  He definitely brought a great sound out of the songs!

After all these songs were written, out of nowhere I came up with this music video concept for ""Live In the Dream"" and felt a strong spiritual sense wash over me, and a knowing that this video has to happen no matter what.  Immediately, I contacted a friend of mine in Austin who is a news camera man, films music videos, and creates some of the most stunning fashion photography I've ever seen in my life!  I told him my idea in depth and he immediately jumped on board.  We are going to make a visually beautiful and emotionally moving music video showing people from all walks of life.  I am unable to say more than that at this time, unfortunately.  Both the videographer and I agree the music video concept + the song, along with my 7,000+ fan base, are almost guarenteed to go viral.  As he said, ""This video will be viral for a very long time.  The song and concept have serious staying power.""  Normally, he only works with high-profile clients who can pay $1,000 a day or more (along with all travel costs), but he is willing to work for a drastically reduced rate of whatever I can comfortably pay without breaking the bank.  I would really like to pay him at least $1,000.  He's driving all the way from Austin, staying with friends, and is wanting to dedicate an entire week to filming and editing the music video.  The only reason he is doing this video is because he genuinely believes in the project and my music.  He's taking a chance on me.

Here is how everything is getting broken down:
 
- Music video
- Recording Costs (already covered!)
- Merchandise Line (no costs here, doing it myself)
- Graphic Design work for EP/Flyers/etc  (no costs here either, making it myself)
 
Your financial gifts will be helping with the music video.  We're aiming to film the music video in around 6-8 weeks. The videographer has no idea I am going through a site such as this one to raise the money.  So, here I am asking for your help.  Any help at all.  I am unable to offer much of a reward at this time, BUT I can promise to send you the EP for free way before it's ever released.  If I can, I'll give you some free merchandise if you want them.

– hello!  We are Orfeia Vocal Ensemble – a non-profit Maryland/D.C.- based, internationally-recognized Balkan women’s choir dedicated
to preserving traditional Bulgarian music and culture.  We’re raising money to produce a Balkan
Songbook and learning CD in order to share the captivatingly beautiful
traditional music of Bulgaria and the Balkans. </p><p><b>Your tax-deductible donation will help us sustain our musical mission.</b><br/></p><p>Orfeia plans to produce the songbook not only to share and memorialize a unique collection of songs but also to keep our group alive and strong and able to continue to celebrate these traditions in the coming years, and to support our amazing teacher who has worked tirelessly to give us the gift of the Balkan sound. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FKtxK34MmaVc%3Ffeature%3Doembed%26start%3D26&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKtxK34MmaVc&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FKtxK34MmaVc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>Orpheus, the legendary musical story-teller and our inspiration, is said to be from the Balkan region of Thrace, so it's no surprise that the music of the Balkans is known for its breathtaking harmonies, exciting dissonances, and
remarkable and unique rhythms.  If you’ve
heard the music, you know what we’re talking about and you’ve already fallen under
its spell.  If this is your first time,
be prepared to fall in love. Orfeia has had the opportunity to travel and perform in Bulgaria, and each trip has deepened our commitment to the music. One of our favorite memories from our 2010 trip is Tatiana directing us in this impromptu performance of a medley of traditional songs in the Old Town of Sozopol, surrounded by ancient remnants of the southern fortress walls.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FZKB01z8EdnY%3Ffeature%3Doembed%26start%3D20&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZKB01z8EdnY&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZKB01z8EdnY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">
The music and cultures of the Balkan region (including Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Macedonia, and Bosnia) are centuries old. Traditional vocal music has been handed down from parent to child

heritage and no one is better qualified to do so than Bulgarian national
treasure Tatiana Sarbinska, Orfeia’s artistic director.  Formerly a principal soloist with the Pirin
Ensemble and recipient of the Ivan Vasov award for contributions to Bulgarian
culture, Tatiana brings to the project an encyclopedic knowledge of Bulgarian
traditional music and culture and more than three decades of teaching vocal
technique to beginner and professional, young and old. </span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/626333/files/20140604135952-Tanya_and_Kolyo_with_Ava_IMG_5308.jpg?1401915592"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In 2012, Tatiana<span> and Orfeia recorded, transcribed, and assembled
teaching materials for a Balkan vocal residency with Carpe Diem Arts in
Montgomery County, Maryland. Through this workshop we led a multi-age, multi-cultural
community choir in learning and performing songs from across Balkan regions,
including Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Macedonia, and Bosnia. After just four rehearsals the group joined Orfeia for a successful public concert and a
performance at a local music festival. This experience was part of the
inspiration for the Balkan Songbook.</span></p><p><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">“I had never sung Balkan music before

</h3><p>The Songbook and CD will feature a selection of twenty-five songs from Orfeia’s repertoire, drawn from the archives of Tatiana Sarbinska. The songs will be a voyage through the unique and diverse styles of the different folk regions of Bulgaria, with side trips across its borders to other areas of the Balkans. The Songbook can be easily used by individual singers, duets and trios, and small to large choruses. The book will offer an overview of Balkan vocal techniques and authentic sound production and placement, together with words, music, and translations.  The learning CD will give instruction on pronunciation, a recording of the full song with all parts, and individual recordings of each vocal part.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/634852/files/20140608195013-pitat_me_mamo.jpg?1402282213"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p>
<p>Orfeia’s fundraising goal to support Tatiana's time and produce

transcribing musical scores, developing the instructional content for the
Songbook, and recording and engineering the learning tracks for the CD. Our
first stretch goal of up to $10,000 will allow us to add additional
demonstrations of Balkan vocal techniques and exercises (including placement and
ornamentation) on the learning CD, and to increase the production quality of
the book, including original cover art. A stretch goal of up to $12,000 will
allow us to expand the content of the book with photographs and original artwork,
descriptions of the cultural context of the music, and to include unique food
recipes from different Bulgarian regions.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/634906/files/20140608202537-chickpeas.jpg?1402284337"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>Orfeia is a non-profit 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, so</b> <b>your donation is tax-deductible! </b></p>We would like to thank you for your donations and have put together a special set of gifts we think you will enjoy - see the perks on the sidebar! <p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/634537/files/20140608162119-P1010677.JPG?1402269679"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>From Orfeia's 2010 trip to the National Festival of Bulgarian Folklore in Koprivshtitsa</p><p><br/></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We understand that not everyone who is excited about the Balkan Songbook Project is able to contribute financially, but that's not the only way you can support our work!

– zdravejte
– hello!  We are Orfeia Vocal Ensemble – a non-profit Maryland/D.C.- based, internationally-recognized Balkan women’s choir dedicated
to preserving traditional Bulgarian music and culture.  We’re raising money to produce a Balkan
Songbook and learning CD in order to share the captivatingly beautiful
traditional music of Bulgaria and the Balkans. Your tax-deductible donation will help us sustain our musical mission.Orfeia plans to produce the songbook not only to share and memorialize a unique collection of songs but also to keep our group alive and strong and able to continue to celebrate these traditions in the coming years, and to support our amazing teacher who has worked tirelessly to give us the gift of the Balkan sound. Orpheus, the legendary musical story-teller and our inspiration, is said to be from the Balkan region of Thrace, so it's no surprise that the music of the Balkans is known for its breathtaking harmonies, exciting dissonances, and
remarkable and unique rhythms.  If you’ve
heard the music, you know what we’re talking about and you’ve already fallen under
its spell.  If this is your first time,
be prepared to fall in love. Orfeia has had the opportunity to travel and perform in Bulgaria, and each trip has deepened our commitment to the music. One of our favorite memories from our 2010 trip is Tatiana directing us in this impromptu performance of a medley of traditional songs in the Old Town of Sozopol, surrounded by ancient remnants of the southern fortress walls.
The music and cultures of the Balkan region (including Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Macedonia, and Bosnia) are centuries old. Traditional vocal music has been handed down from parent to child
over centuries, but these traditions are becoming lost. We want to sustain and make available this wonderful
heritage and no one is better qualified to do so than Bulgarian national
treasure Tatiana Sarbinska, Orfeia’s artistic director.  Formerly a principal soloist with the Pirin
Ensemble and recipient of the Ivan Vasov award for contributions to Bulgarian
culture, Tatiana brings to the project an encyclopedic knowledge of Bulgarian
traditional music and culture and more than three decades of teaching vocal
technique to beginner and professional, young and old. 
In 2012, Tatiana and Orfeia recorded, transcribed, and assembled
teaching materials for a Balkan vocal residency with Carpe Diem Arts in
Montgomery County, Maryland. Through this workshop we led a multi-age, multi-cultural
community choir in learning and performing songs from across Balkan regions,
including Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Macedonia, and Bosnia. After just four rehearsals the group joined Orfeia for a successful public concert and a
performance at a local music festival. This experience was part of the
inspiration for the Balkan Songbook.“I had never sung Balkan music before
but Tatiana’s teaching methods made it fun and accessible for our diverse group of singers. I was so taken by Tatiana and the music that I auditioned and joined her
ensemble Orfeia.” Rhonda Kranz, Carpe Diem singer and Orfeia member

The Songbook and CD will feature a selection of twenty-five songs from Orfeia’s repertoire, drawn from the archives of Tatiana Sarbinska. The songs will be a voyage through the unique and diverse styles of the different folk regions of Bulgaria, with side trips across its borders to other areas of the Balkans. The Songbook can be easily used by individual singers, duets and trios, and small to large choruses. The book will offer an overview of Balkan vocal techniques and authentic sound production and placement, together with words, music, and translations.  The learning CD will give instruction on pronunciation, a recording of the full song with all parts, and individual recordings of each vocal part.What We Need & What You Get
Orfeia’s fundraising goal to support Tatiana's time and produce
the book and CD is $7,000.  Production includes selecting music,
transcribing musical scores, developing the instructional content for the
Songbook, and recording and engineering the learning tracks for the CD. Our
first stretch goal of up to $10,000 will allow us to add additional
demonstrations of Balkan vocal techniques and exercises (including placement and
ornamentation) on the learning CD, and to increase the production quality of
the book, including original cover art. A stretch goal of up to $12,000 will
allow us to expand the content of the book with photographs and original artwork,
descriptions of the cultural context of the music, and to include unique food
recipes from different Bulgarian regions.Orfeia is a non-profit 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, so your donation is tax-deductible! We would like to thank you for your donations and have put together a special set of gifts we think you will enjoy - see the perks on the sidebar! From Orfeia's 2010 trip to the National Festival of Bulgarian Folklore in KoprivshtitsaOther Ways You Can HelpWe understand that not everyone who is excited about the Balkan Songbook Project is able to contribute financially, but that's not the only way you can support our work!

<h3>Who is REENIE?</h3>
<p>I'm Reenie Perkovic, a Toronto-based guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter!</p>
<p>This project, my sophomore album Parallel Place, represents a culmination of moving to Toronto, a full leap into pursuing my passion as a musician, an incredible outpouring of support and love from a new musical community, learning to listen to my own voice and fighting ""the good fight,"" as Paulo Coelho puts it, every day towards developing that sound.</p>
<p>I have taken my classical training as an instrumentalist and composer, and inspiration from the many talented pop and jazz musicians I have met and collaborated with here, and am creating something that I am truly proud of.</p>
<p>This album will feature:<br/>Tara Kannangara - trumpet<br/>David Rubel - tenor sax<br/>Aidan Sibley - trombone<br/>Chris Pruden &amp; Winston Matsushita - piano/keys<br/>Dave Haskett &amp; Phill Albert - bass<br/>Robert Diack - drums<br/>Lea Kirstein &amp; Rachel Capon - strings</p>
<p>BUT, it is an ambitious project, and I need your help to realize it in its entirety.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is the inspiration behind Parallel Place?</h3>
<p>We've all wondered: ""What If?"" What would life be like if I'd gone a different direction? We're all searching for that Parallel Place in the universe where we have all the things we desire, where we feel fulfilled.</p>
<p>This album is about every day people, searching for more from life and from themselves. It's about the artist in all of us, searching for that one song, that one melody, that one texture, that one lyric that will make us feel complete and connected.</p>
<p>Well folks, we've finally found an album full of those moments and we REALLY want to share them with you!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're recording at a studio in town called Canterbury Music Company, with a talented engineer named Jeremy Darby, who has worked with the likes of: <em>Ella Fitzgerald, Aerosmith, Keith Richards</em>...to name a few. SO EXCITING.</p>
<p>But there's much more that goes into making a successful recording:</p>
<p>Recording/mixing: $5,800<br/>Producer: $800<br/>Paying all the musicians fairly: $3,700<br/>Mastering: $600<br/>Album artwork: $200<br/>Making physical copies of the CD: $1,320</p>
<p>TOTAL: $12,420</p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>As you can see, this campaign won't cover everything. But I've applied for a couple of grants to help with the remainder. Wish me luck!</p>
<p>***** By PRE-ORDERING the album in advance you will help us finish it and get it to your ears ASAP! *****</p>
<p>And if you're feeling especially supportive, take a look at our list of AWESOME perks. You can order a new song written by us for you, or dinner and a night of serenading, or we may even take requests for YOUR OWN perk ideas!</p>

<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We've gone into the studio a couple of times already, so that we can continue to show you sneak previews of what we're working on!</p>
<p>The rest of the album all relies on you and your belief in us, my friends!</p>
<p>I've finally created something I'm so incredibly proud of, and cannot wait to share it with you. A fusion of old school R&amp;B and modern pop. Songs about things we all feel.</p>

Lady Sings it Better are going to Edinburgh Fringe! After sell out seasons in Sydney and Adelaide, we've been offered a spot by Remarkable Arts in 2012. This baby's going international!
Lady Sings it Better are a cabaret troupe of six female singers (and a 3 piece band), who take songs written by men and reinvent them in a woman's voice. Put simply, we tell stories about women, with glorious, surprising arrangements. But anyone who's seen us will say we're much more than that! The audience get a playful, sassy, tongue-in-cheek, feminist romp through popular culture (and some alternative culture too). This is really ""something for everyone"" cabaret! 

The Impact
For the performers, this tour will have a lasting impact on their 
artistic careers. They will benefit from intensive training during preparation, and from performing in front of
 presenters, programmers, directors and producers at the world's largest
 international fringe festival. 
For blackcat productions (Maeve and 
Phoebe), this opportunity is about proving ourselves and launching our careers as Producers of high quality women and queer cabaret artists. At the Edinburgh Fringe we will meet the world's best producers, directors and cabaret performers, and we'll network with producers, programmers and promoters from all around the world. We will use the connections made and experience gained to expand our portfolio of work, develop new cabaret productions, and approach other artists, offering our services for the production of their local and international tours. This is a career-making adventure, the spoils of which we hope to share with Sydney's growing community of independent cabaret artists.

What We Need

So we're off to Edinburgh, but it ain't cheap! The total budget (carefully planned by Phoebe)  is over $50,000! We're pursuing a number of fundraising sources, from sponsorship, to gigs, to grants, to precious pennies currently being saved in Maeve and Phoebe's own bank accounts! So, why Indiegogo? Why now?
The $25,000 we hope to raise on indiegogo pays for flights and accommodation, which we want to book and pay for as soon as possible, so as to get good deals and lock in the trip! The money raised on indiegogo will be spent as follows:

- accommodation: $8,500 approx. (1 month in Edinburgh and a few nights in London: we promise to blog about the hilarity of shared living!)

What happens if we don't raise this much? We'll have to pursue other funding sources - sources which are, unfortunately, much harder to access. This fundraising will be slower, meaning we have to pay for costs later, most likely making them greater. At worst, we won't be able to go. If we can't go to Edinburgh, we'll use funds raised to tour within Australia, to Melbourne and Adelaide, with a view to heading to Edinburgh in 2013.

vocabulaire est limité et plus direct, ce qui me permet d’exprimer clairement
une émotion en m’adressant à un interlocuteur. Les textes de Richard Desjardins et Joni Mitchell sont une
source d’inspiration continuelle. </p>
<p>Dans les deux langues, les thèmes explorés
sont universels : l’amour, le deuil, la recherche de soi et du bonheur, la
nature. Le ton y est parfois contemplatif, parfois conversationnel, autres fois
humoristique. Bien que le style musical prédominant soit le jazz, l’intention
fondamentale dans la composition est de peindre le texte en musique. Cela

Canadian singer-songwriters like Richard Desjardins and Joni Mitchell, 
Marie-Claire Durand writes unique and compelling songs in both official 
languages. In French, her mother tongue, she uses words to paint images 
of an introspective and meditative universe. In English, a
 language she associates with her relationships, she writes in 
a more direct way, communicating her emotions to a listener.<br/><br/>In both languages, Marie-Claire explores 
universal themes: love, grief, the search for peace and happiness, and 
for oneself. The tone of the songs is at times contemplative, other 
times conversational, and sometimes humorous. <br/><br/>Stemming from her 
musical background as a jazz pianist, Marie-Claire's songs can mostly be
 described as jazz, although the fundamental intention of each 
composition is to paint the words with music. This sometimes results in a
 classic song form, and sometimes in an 
original form which follows the contours of the poem.</p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p>

for oneself. The tone of the songs is at times contemplative, other 
times conversational, and sometimes humorous. Stemming from her 
musical background as a jazz pianist, Marie-Claire's songs can mostly be
 described as jazz, although the fundamental intention of each 
composition is to paint the words with music. This sometimes results in a
 classic song form, and sometimes in an 
original form which follows the contours of the poem.

</div></div>","Yoshi Gish is on a lone mission to visit his elderly grandmother in Cincinnati, Ohio to perform for her 83rd birthday, before moving to Los Angeles, CA. Yoshi's Grandmother is very dear to him, and he wants to see her before he moves across the country to play and record his music.       After being gone a second time for a whole month, he has gained life changing experience on the road. This has opened doors for many opportunities for Yoshi Gish.  With the help of fans,  friends, and his family, this tour can happen.    This Fall Tour of 2014 will start in Florida, initially financed only by Merch sales and the money he earns from each show he plays on his journey. Yoshi will be passing through large cities, ones where he will be less likely to get shot, or car jacked in his sleep. In two months time the tour should end in Hollywood, California. NEW PRIZE OFFER!!!  With a wristband, you will be able to Enter the Return of Yoshi Gish in FloridaFREE!$5 - If you can help me with gas money:*****in a video collage for my 2014 TOUR VIDEO at www.Youtube.com/yoshigish <Video Release Target Date: Thanksgiving Day 2014>$10, or more, I can send you 1 glowing wristband and PERK #1!*PLUS PERK #1 FREE SHIPPING!!!

Preparing for the Journey
Many things need to be taken care of before departure, and again during the adventure. here is an example of those expenses you can help me with.

Oil change ($25)
Brakes/rotors ($100)
Motor mounts ($100)
Merch: CD's, Shirts, Stickers ($1,000)



Costs & Expenses while on the road
Yoshi will be traveling alone, from one state of friends and family, to another by what he earns from playing each venue, and from what merch he can sell.

Food (value meals)
Oil change ($30)
Gas (23/mpg)
Storage ($100/mo)

Cell Phone ($100/mo)
Car Insurance ($100/mo)

Medicine (in case of illness)
Truck Stop Showers (Not Safe, but effective)
No Hotels (Too creepy, too expensive)

Other Ways You Can Help

Some people just won't be able to go to all of the shows, but you can still help fund the rest of the tour:

fund gas at $5/gal for 25mpg.
buy a CD or shirt!
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

Ask friends to get the word out and make some noise about this fund raiser.
Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!  



These are the dates to look for him in your state:

 Yoshi will be strategically Zig-Zagging across the country for 9 weeks, driving 6,000+ Miles, hitting 40+ cities and 27+ states to play his music for his distant fans, friends, and family.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Lola Moore and I am a Pastor and Worship Artist based out of Panama City, Florida. While I've been in Pastoral Ministry for nearly four years, I have been singing in choirs and as a soloist for as long as I can remember. </p>
<p>I've had opportunity to minister across the United States and internationally as Worship Artist, sharing with congregations through preaching and song . Consistently, I am nearly harassed for not having music product to share. I hope to change that, this year. </p>
<p>Grammy-nominated Producer and phenomenal musician, Kelvin Wooten will produce this short project and is slated to work with me on the full album, as well. It's been so exciting to watch and hear what I've hummed in my kitchen coming to life through his work. </p>
<p>I've already begun funding this project but need your help. My hope is to release recording in the beginning of December in Huntsville, Alabama. Three events will provide fantastic opportunities to get the word out. Because they're in the same geographic region, they provide major opportunities for maximum impact.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The funds you give will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsor music: Studio time, background vocalists, live musicians.</li>
<li>Underwrite marketing: Graphic Design, Photography, Packaging, Promotional Material.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe God has given me gifts for the world. I have dreamt that if I could just have the opportunity, God would accomplish mighty works through me. It's happened on small scale and this is my attempt to see if there's more. </p>
<p>Also, you can ask yourself if what God does through me has blessed you. If so, perhaps you can help me bless others, as well.</p>

I have been writing songs since I was a young girl and music has always been my true passion in life. My songs are inspired by personal experience and my music has been described as “songs of substance.” In 2010 I was contacted by a music manager in America who expressed interest in helping me move forward in my journey as an artist. At the time I had no management in Australia and was struggling to even book shows. We forged a team and I am now at the point where things are really starting to come together and it’s time to start seriously pushing my music. THE PROJECTI recorded and produced an independent EP last year (“Overstayed Welcome”) in the US which has garnered a lot of attention in the music industry. As a result of this, I have been invited back to re-record more of my original music in a professional studio in Manhattan, New York City. I am aiming to record a full length album which has always been a dream of mine and I want to give my songs the best production possible.

   To this point I have raised just a little over half of these funds and I now need YOUR help and support to raise $9,000 in order to realise my recording goal. 








WHEN AND WHERE

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello there. My name is Milo Hayden. I'm an independent composer and artist based out of Portland, OR.</p>
<p>For years I played music in the classical scene, playing violin at competitions, in orchestras, and in chamber groups. It was fun to perform, but there was a certain element that was lacking. I could make the violin sing, but where was my voice?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Armed with a laptop and a pickup, I aimed to start exploring the music of my heart and see where that journey would take me. Now, nine months later, the path I am on is leading me to a debut album. The songs are there, the interest is there, I just need help with the final push to make it a reality.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>60 days of fundraising for 60 minutes of music. Sounds like a challenge.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Almost all the music I make has found it's audience in the performing arts. I've performed with aerialists, acrobats, dancers, and for friends. My music has been featured on tv, in nightclubs, and at large and small events. </div>
<div>In all these instances it has simply been word of mouth and trust in my abilities that have granted me an audience and a chance to perform. With this album I can reach more performers, a larger audience, and greater opportunities to perform my music and create unique experiences within listeners.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to reach $5000 by the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>That should cover recording time with a professional recording studio, mastering for the entire album, a physical CD release, merchandise, release party/performance, and a music video.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The final result will be a high-quality professional release that will be available to everyone that donates to my campaign. Also, for those of you in the Portland, OR area, there will be an official release event where the entire album will be played from start to finish, live and with musicians. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'm going to get this out there as much as possible within the next 60 days, but it doesn't end there. It's important that this campaign goes far and wide with your help. Share it on facebook, email it to friends and other musicians, and if there are any blogs or websites that you think it would be perfect for... send it their way.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If we are able to make it to LA to showcase we will be able to get our break as other notable bands have done before us at the World Wide Radio Summit. Bands such as Dead Letter Circus and Temper Trap have all showcased and have then gone on to be some of this country's biggest bands. We don't expect the world to ever come from anything, but this is the biggest opportunity we've ever been given and we'd love you to share in this with us.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The opportunity to showcase at the World Wide Radio Summit has come to us unexpectedly and with little notice, and we are forever grateful to be accepted, and we need to get there!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This year has seen us head to the studio and record two new singles, that each one of you will get for free when you donate, in return you will share with us the journey of reaching our goal to fly to LA and showcase our music to the USA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On this journey you will receive daily video updates and photo via an exclusive mailout, and also receive a signed copy of our last release.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For those of you that pledge the top dollar (2 only) we will bring Alibrandi to you for a fully fledged rock concert and classic Australian BBQ. (SE Queensland/ Northern NSW only)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot pledge it would mean a great deal to us all if you were to share this link via Facebook or Twitter and help get the word out.</p>

<i>transit</i> is a five-man Vocal Band from Raleigh, North Carolina. <i>transit</i> is five singers, that's it.  Our only instruments are our natural born voices.  Everything you hear from the stage and on our studio recordings begins with the human voice.  Utilizing the latest technology we combine our vocal talents with stage and studio effects to bring our music to life and put on a show that those who have never seen a vocal band will hardly believe.<p></p>
<p><br/><i>transit</i> draws on the combined talents of 5 extraordinary individuals who have been a part of the vocal music scene for more than ten years.  Their love for a cappella is second only to their love for music.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need your help to keep our show on the road and spread our unique style of music to the World.  We take a cappella into the realm of Rock n' Roll in a way that you cannot believe. We are dedicated to bringing our music to people all over the World and <u>Rock</u> <u>Your</u> <u><b>Face</b></u> <u>Off</u>!  </p>
<p>In order to take our sound to the next level, we need new equipment for our live show and for the recording studio.  We've launched a wide range of exclusive, never-before-seen <i>transit</i> perks of all kinds for you guys!  Take the step from fan to VIP today!</p>

<p>ChamberLab is on a mission to tunnel under the wall that separates classical music from every other kind of music in the world. This series started with a bunch of frantic emails and a couple of rehearsals, and has grown with each quarterly concert into something truly wonderful. It's time to step up and show off what we've done, and to make a record of it in the process. <strong>This is our victory lap!</strong></p>
<p>It's also a great opportunity for those of you who've missed some of our previous concerts to hear our favorite pieces from the last year. We'll feature music by Chris Black, Benjamin DeGain, Dante Rosano, Marco Rosano (seen in the video above), Tony Rosano, and more ...</p>

<p><strong>This is just the bottom-line, must-have goal to make this concert</strong> <strong>work! More is better.

<p>Hello we are <strong>Dammit!</strong> A San Francisco California based Metal/Punk band. What we are trying to do is record our feature length album and then set off on a tour. San Francisco has a rich history of Thrash Metal from bands like Exodus, Death Angel, Metallica and we are hoping to fulfill our dreams of following in the footsteps of these great bands and bring you the best possible record. Our dreams of the album are long overdue and that is why we are finally asking you for help.  Our band has been doing local gigs for years in seedy dive bars around the Bay and the proverbial clock is ticking. Is there a time limit on your dreams?</p>

<p>Often we think to ourselves with the high cost of living in the area how the hell are we going to afford the costs for recording and releasing our album especially as an indie band.

<p><em>In 1994 at the age 7 my older brother  Joel was diagnosed with non Hodgkin’s lymphoma(type of cancer). He would spend the next couple of years in and out of Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles. It was very tough battle but he fought hard and pulled through.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>One of things that stood out most to me while my brother was in the hospital. Is  he would always come home from the hospital with a bunch of toys.

<p><em>In 2001 I was 12 years old and decided I wanted to give back to the hospital that saved my brothers life.  My cousin Allie Nelson  joined me and together  with help  from  our parents we would form Give To Others!</em></p>
<p><em>Give To Others goal is to put a smile on hundreds of faces and give hope back to those who have lost it. We never knew that a simple thing such as a toy can make a child want to fight back.

We released a full length album in 2011 called ""Misanthropic Slaughter"" with producer Ryan Green (Megadeth, NOFX, Alice Cooper) that received almost 70 positive reviews and more than one rating of ""Best Album of the Year"" for 2011.

We are very proud of what we did on our full length album but we are confident we can make a recording of this new material even better. We don't just want to record this album, we NEED to record this album, but we need your help.</strong><br/><br/><strong> We want to record a five song EP of all new material and re-record two songs from the ""Who Needs a Shepherd?""

<h3><strong>Training Orchestras are Needed!</strong></h3>
<p>Training orchestras are designed to give aspiring professionals and students real-world experience and training in the art of orchestral performance.  These orchestras provide essential training for students who literally sit next to professionals in the field. Students need:</p>
<ul>
<li>professional opportunities </li>
<li>professional rehearsal schedules</li>
<li>repeat performances </li>
<li>mentorship</li>
</ul>
<p>Orchestra Next will accomplish all of this. </p>

<p></p>
<h3>Here's what we need</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $10,000 on this campaign.  </p>
<p>We've already raised the money to hire our principals for the season which amounts to $16,800.  This covers 15-16 principals for 6 rehearsals and 6 concerts at $90 a service. </p>
<p>We need about $14,500 to give $500 to each trainee over the course of the season.  Of that, we've raised $4,500 already, and are looking to boost that by $10,000.  On this site, if we raise more than $10,000, we'll simply return that surplus to the trainees as an added bonus.  They certainly deserve it!</p>

influences can be heard in our music. From the jazzy drums and rippling bass to
the fluid guitar leads, sweeping keyboard riffs and story telling vocals our
music takes you on a journey from beginning to end.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is this all about?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This
campaign is to raise funds for our third album and a movie to accompany it. The
album is a take on the life of Jack the Ripper, a kind of back story if you
will. A little creative license applied and we see how difficult growing up in
the late 19th century is for a young boy. The harsh realities of prostitution,
brutality and shocking loss leave young Jack struggling to cope. How will he
deal with it all? We are planning on making a silent film using the music from
the album as the story teller.</p>
<p>This
has been in the head of Blake, the writer of the album, for a long time. The
vision of making a movie instead of a couple of videos to accompany an album
came when he was looking through old Victorian images on the web and trying to
put a story line together with pictures.  There is a story to be told here, this is
about Jack but it could be about anyone who suffers hardship and tragedy at a
young age. We all handle our pain in different ways and that, at least to some
extent, defines us, no matter where or when we live.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why we need you.....</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Making
this movie is a big deal for us! We are still a young band trying to make our
way into a much larger family of melodic, progressive bands. We hope that this
movie will help us reach more of those whom we know would love our music.
Please know that what ever we do it will always be about the stories inside the
music and giving you the opportunity to laugh or cry, smile or frown and take
something away from the music and story that will help you through your day,
week, or life.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We
have some things already in place and are using the barter system to get
portions of the production done but we still need some equipment and perhaps
some licenses to use public areas for filming. This fundraiser is also for CD
and DVD manufacture as well as artwork for the whole project.</p>

<h2><span>Who we are</span></h2>
<p>We are Destructive Penguins, a band originated from our hometown, Leiden. Since 2013 we have been grinding our butts off to create some of the dopest music you will ever hear, resulting in a very diverse tracklist whilst maintaining a consistent and coherent sound. Think Hip Hop with Funk, Reggae, Pop and Rock.</p>
<p>For a quick impression of our music and sound you can check our <a href=""https://www.soundcloud.com/destructivepenguins"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SoundCloud</a> and listen to this rehearsal recording of one of our tracks that will be featured on the EP. Our EP will be even better.</p>

<p>But now it’s time to take it to another level. We want to get into the world and let our music be heard. We are finally going to record our very first EP!</p>
<h2>What we need and what you get</h2>
<p>Our goal for this crowdfunding is to generate enough money to make this EP. Now this isn’t just paying the studio time, recording it and releasing it. No, we are going big.</p>
<p>We need to be able to press CD’s, make merch, setup an awesome photoshoot, artwork and licensing. All of the money will be spent on these things.</p>
<p>After all the work is done, we also want to be able to celebrate the release of our EP with you guys. We are releasing our EP on February the 12th in Gebr. De Nobel in Leiden with a very, very special show in a very special venue.</p>
<p>So what’s in it for you guys? By pledging certain amounts, you get different kinds of rewards. There are tickets for the release show, digital downloads, CD’s, merch and some very special rewards like a concert in your living room (we’ll keep it down, we promise).</p>
<p>Some perks, like a CD, can be shipped to your adress. For now we won’t charge any shipping costs as we want to give everyone the chance to pick up their rewards at a later mentioned adress or at the release party. When the time comes we will sent everyone an e-mail asking you whether or not you want your reward shipped. The shipping costs depend on your reward and your location.</p>

<p>Besides donating a certain amount of money to our crowdfunding, there are of course other ways to help us out during our campaign! We need to get the word out to as many people possible and by sharing our campaign to your friends you’re doing exactly that!</p>

</div></div>","Who we are
We are Destructive Penguins, a band originated from our hometown, Leiden. Since 2013 we have been grinding our butts off to create some of the dopest music you will ever hear, resulting in a very diverse tracklist whilst maintaining a consistent and coherent sound. Think Hip Hop with Funk, Reggae, Pop and Rock.
For a quick impression of our music and sound you can check our SoundCloud and listen to this rehearsal recording of one of our tracks that will be featured on the EP. Our EP will be even better.
Music is our passion and for us there’s nothing like playing our music for you guys, our fans, our friends and our family.
But now it’s time to take it to another level. We want to get into the world and let our music be heard. We are finally going to record our very first EP!
What we need and what you get
Our goal for this crowdfunding is to generate enough money to make this EP. Now this isn’t just paying the studio time, recording it and releasing it. No, we are going big.
We need to be able to press CD’s, make merch, setup an awesome photoshoot, artwork and licensing. All of the money will be spent on these things.
After all the work is done, we also want to be able to celebrate the release of our EP with you guys. We are releasing our EP on February the 12th in Gebr. De Nobel in Leiden with a very, very special show in a very special venue.
So what’s in it for you guys? By pledging certain amounts, you get different kinds of rewards. There are tickets for the release show, digital downloads, CD’s, merch and some very special rewards like a concert in your living room (we’ll keep it down, we promise).
Some perks, like a CD, can be shipped to your adress. For now we won’t charge any shipping costs as we want to give everyone the chance to pick up their rewards at a later mentioned adress or at the release party. When the time comes we will sent everyone an e-mail asking you whether or not you want your reward shipped. The shipping costs depend on your reward and your location.
By pledging, you will be updated with all the progress we are making.

[FR] Bonjour
à tous !Après la sortie de nos deux premiers albums
""Syndrome"" (2011)  et ""Eutheria"" (2012),
nous sommes en train d'enregistrer notre 3ème album pour lequel nous
avons créé un univers émotionnel, violent et atmosphérique
.Avant de continuer, pour ceux qui sont tombés sur note
campagne Indiegogo et qui ne nous connaissent pas, nous sommes
Gravity, groupe de métal Montpelliérain formé depuis 2009. Le
groupe est composé d'Alex (guitare), Emilie (chant), Tim (basse) et
Richy (batterie) et depuis notre formation nous avons fait de
nombreux concerts, notamment au côté de groupe comme Betraying The
Martyrs, Uneven Structure, More
Than A Thousand, Upon This Drawning,

Zuul Fx, As They Burn, Kalisia ... 
Jusqu'à
présent, nous avions pour habitude de financièrement mener notre
barque par nous même, mais récemment nous arrivons à une étape de
notre avancée musicale où nous manquons de fonds et c'est ici que
vous pouvez nous aider !   Chacune de vos contributions nous
sera grandement utile! Vous pouvez devenir acteur de
ce projet et nous soutenir dans cette aventure !Actuellement,
nous avons terminé la composition de notre troisième album ( dans
lequel nous avons mis tout notre amour évidemment ^^ ) et commencé
son enregistrement.  L'utilisation  des fonds nous
permettrait donc :

-
A partir de 1500 euro : Mixer et masteriser le troisième
album-
A partir de 2000 euro :Réaliser le design de l'album- A partir de 3000 euro :Pressage de l'album- A partir de
	5000 euro :Réaliser un clip vidéo !- A partir de 7000
	euro :Créer de nouveau design pour les t-shirts et faire leurs
	impressionsNéanmoins, si
	la somme n'est pas atteinte, sachez que nous ferons quand même
	tout notre possible pour réaliser notre troisième album ! --> Un petit aperçu du contenu du projet : Pour ce 3ème album, nous avons choisi de travailler avec :- Aurélien Peirera de Uneven Structure/Flatcurve pour le mixage et le mastering.    Liens : https://www.facebook.com/flatcurve                 http://fltcrv.com/- Igor Omodei de Uneven Structure/Igor Omodei A/V pour le design de l'album et le clip !Liens: https://www.facebook.com/igoromodei             www.igoromodei.com Nous vous invitons à aller checker leurs travaux ! \o/Comment faire  ?

Brooklyn, NY. As some of you may already know and for those of you who don't, I have a big opportunity on my
hands. My iPhone recordings have made it into the hands of a dream producer of
mine down in Nashville, TN. His name is Andrija Tokic; he’s the guy responsible
for some really wonderful albums from bands such as Alabama Shakes, Clear Plastic Masks, The Ettes
&amp; Hurray for the Riff Raff. We’ve been corresponding for a few months now,

<p>But! There is a catch (there’s always a catch isn’t there?) And here’s where you come in. Everything from getting down to Nashville to paying the musicians to even pressing the physical C.D’s costs mula. And that’s why I’ve decided to begin
this campaign. I need your help. If you have made
it this far, I thank you. I thank you SO much for caring enough even to click on this

And in exchange for your dollar bills, not only will you be receiving an incredible record, BUT you will also gain cool perks such as personally recording songs to late night dinners in the park to even free shows! (Check out the perks for more details) And if you can’t give, I completely understand. Please don’t fret! There have been many times where I have been a nickel shy of even an ice cream cone and unable to donate to your beautiful art. Luckily your love and
support is more than enough. Just sharing this link or spreading the word is just as helpful :) </p>

<div>Hey guys!  Thanks for taking the time to watch my IndieGogo campaign video.  Most of you know me as recording artist, Detonator.  I've been building my ""Mr. 9 To 5"" movement, which represents the new generation of independent thinkers &amp; dreamers looking to escape the shackles of their 9-to-5 day job.  It's time we take this show on the road!!</div>
<div>I want you to be a part of getting Detonator to perform at the ""Masters of the Road"" Showcase during the SXSW (South by SouthWest) Music Festival!  This takes place March 21st, 2015, in Austin, TX.  I've had so many people who rock out with me and support the movement ask me how they can help out.  I need you now more than ever!!</div>
<div>There's a $500 sponsorship fee that's required for performers to participate in this showcase.  Now that's a lot of money to come up with, but with your help, it would only take 50 people contributing just $10 each (that's just 1 Alex Hamilton or 2 Abe Lincolns or 10 George Washingtons).  It's up to you how much you want to throw in the plate.  Check out all the dope perks and incentives for the amount you choose to contribute.</div>
<div>Raising this $500 sponsorship fee doesn't only guarantee my spot at performing.  It allows me to spread the ""Mr. 9 To 5"" movement to a way larger audience of independent artists and music fans.  It's an amazing opportunity for networking and exposure.  The showcase is actually free to the general public and a portion of the sponsorship funds go directly to the #MoreArtLessGuns charity.</div>
<div>Be a part of getting Detonator to the SXSW Music Festival!!</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Campaign Goal: $500 to cover sponsorship fee</p>
<p>Every penny counts.  But the more you can contribute, the more great stuff you'll get in return.  Check out the perks:</p> <ul> <li>$10:   Let's Get It Started - Thanks!</li> <li>$22:   Physical CD Copy of ""Mr. 9 To 5""</li>
<li>$35:   Early Release of ""Mr. 9 To 5""</li>
<li>$60:   Limited Edition T-Shirt</li>
<li>$80:   SXSW Greeting Video</li>
<li>$100: Studio Session</li>
<li>$125: Guest Appearance</li>
<li>$150: Director's Cut</li>
<li>$250: The CEO - Brand Sponsorship</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Performing at the ""Masters of the Road"" showcase during the SXSW Music Festival allows our movement to reach a much larger and broader audience.  (We can't be the only ones sick of the 9-to-5 right?)  </p>
<p>Revolutions start small, with ideas and motivated people.  This is our chance to be a part of something major.  Be inspired.  I go so hard for my music because I want people to realize you can achieve anything if you just dedicate the time and not allow your day job to hold you hostage.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Not everybody can contribute..and that's OK.  Here are some other ways to help out:</p> <ul> <li>Invest in funding your own greatness! No really, dedicate $10 TODAY towards your own personal goal..and get your idea moving!  I'd love to support.</li>
<li>Spread the word!  SHARE this campaign post on your social media accounts.  The more that people see it, the more likely they are to take interest.</li> <li>Support the ""Mr. 9 To 5"" mixtape when it's released.  That's a year and a half of blood, sweat, and tears rolled up into an hour of musical euphoria and bliss (unicorns sold separately).  Download it, click play, and tell a friend how much you loved it!!</li>

I want you to be a part of getting Detonator to perform at the ""Masters of the Road"" Showcase during the SXSW (South by SouthWest) Music Festival!  This takes place March 21st, 2015, in Austin, TX.  I've had so many people who rock out with me and support the movement ask me how they can help out.  I need you now more than ever!!
There's a $500 sponsorship fee that's required for performers to participate in this showcase.  Now that's a lot of money to come up with, but with your help, it would only take 50 people contributing just $10 each (that's just 1 Alex Hamilton or 2 Abe Lincolns or 10 George Washingtons).  It's up to you how much you want to throw in the plate.  Check out all the dope perks and incentives for the amount you choose to contribute.
Raising this $500 sponsorship fee doesn't only guarantee my spot at performing.  It allows me to spread the ""Mr. 9 To 5"" movement to a way larger audience of independent artists and music fans.  It's an amazing opportunity for networking and exposure.  The showcase is actually free to the general public and a portion of the sponsorship funds go directly to the #MoreArtLessGuns charity.
Be a part of getting Detonator to the SXSW Music Festival!!
   What We Need & What You Get Campaign Goal: $500 to cover sponsorship fee
Every penny counts.  But the more you can contribute, the more great stuff you'll get in return.  Check out the perks:  $10:   Let's Get It Started - Thanks! $22:   Physical CD Copy of ""Mr. 9 To 5""
$35:   Early Release of ""Mr. 9 To 5""
$60:   Limited Edition T-Shirt
$80:   SXSW Greeting Video
$100: Studio Session
$125: Guest Appearance
$150: Director's Cut
$250: The CEO - Brand Sponsorship
   
The Impact
Performing at the ""Masters of the Road"" showcase during the SXSW Music Festival allows our movement to reach a much larger and broader audience.  (We can't be the only ones sick of the 9-to-5 right?)  
Revolutions start small, with ideas and motivated people.  This is our chance to be a part of something major.  Be inspired.  I go so hard for my music because I want people to realize you can achieve anything if you just dedicate the time and not allow your day job to hold you hostage.

    Other Ways You Can Help Not everybody can contribute..and that's OK.  Here are some other ways to help out:  Invest in funding your own greatness! No really, dedicate $10 TODAY towards your own personal goal..and get your idea moving!  I'd love to support.
Spread the word!  SHARE this campaign post on your social media accounts.  The more that people see it, the more likely they are to take interest. Support the ""Mr. 9 To 5"" mixtape when it's released.  That's a year and a half of blood, sweat, and tears rolled up into an hour of musical euphoria and bliss (unicorns sold separately).  Download it, click play, and tell a friend how much you loved it!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Founded in 2009, Kids In A New
Groove provides kids in the foster system with long-term music mentors. 
The students work with their mentor to learn how to play music while
building strong social emotional learning skills. Our program's goals teach students:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to set, achieve and celebrate goals.</li>
<li>How to build trust and a relationship with an adult

<p>Our students earn rewards over the course of the
program.  Students have the opportunity to earn their

skill.  We have many students who are
about to earn an instrument and we need to purchase these.  We are seeking $4300 to purchase
the instruments that will be awarded by end of the year.   </p>

A Vancouver based non-profit group titled â€œCore Explorers,â€
was given an opportunity to spend time with ancient rural communities in the
far out regions of Nepalâ€™s Himalayan Mountains in April 2012.  A mixed team of artists has been
assembled to trek into these communities in order to experience their ways of
life, and to interpret these customs and values in their own artistic mediums.  I feel exceptionally fortunate to have
been invited and selected to this expedition as the musician among the group,
and am thrilled to be apart of this project.  

 
The goal in mind with this adventure is multi-pronged.  We are going to observe human beings
utilizing tried and true customs of living sustainably, stripping ourselves of
material crutches and modern dependencies in order to remember who we really
are, and what we really need to be happy, and finally, to come back with a
story to share with schools and universities.  

 

The Impact

This opportunity is so unique because the areas we are
trekking to have been visited by few, if any, westerners.  Furthermore, these communities have not
yet been hit by the flood of tourism, but are going to be in the coming
years.  Our project, in essence, is
designed to artistically capture this moment in time, to preserve a glimpse of
the identity and ways of these people before it is gone, and aim to do this via
the production of a documentary movie. 
It is our hope that this film and our experience may impact minds young
and old, and bring about awareness of a way of life we have long forgotten.  Stories are what keep cultures alive,
and what ultimately connects us to discovering who we really are. 

 



The Funds

$5000 is what I am in need of to go on this month long
journey through the remote mountains of Nepal, and this covers everything.  We will be trekking through the

I'm Australian Composer Georgia Scott, and I need your help to make my ballet 'The Undercurrent' become a reality.



A little bit about myself:
 
I'm a composer, which means that I write new music in many different genres I studied at the Royal College of Music, graduating earlier this year
I started composing at eleven years old, and it's my lifelong dream to continue writing as a professional career 

Composition is expensive. Whilst physically, we need just pens and paper, or perhaps a computer with notation software, the true cost is much dearer.

Recording costs, promotional spending, venue and rehearsal costs and travelling to and from performances of your work all rack up large expenditure, which on an income reliant on long-term composing commissions makes big projects very difficult to afford, particularly for a recent graduate living abroad.
So this is where you come in: I need your help.

'The Undercurrent': a New Ballet
I've written a major orchestral work in collaboration with Choreographer Alice Weber, Set Designer Stephanie Ferris and Costume Designer Lotte Welsh. We are going to be looking for performances all over the world, but cannot submit the pitch of this project to orchestras and ballet companies without having a professional recording of the score to demonstrate the feasibility and artistic integrity of the music.
As such, we've managed to secure a recording session with the world-renowned Janáček Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Mikel Toms on October 12th-13th 2015. 
However, this is not cheap. Whilst I've managed to fund over €10,000 of this project myself, I simply cannot afford the final amount needed to make this happen.

  
We need to raise a total of £3,500 to pay for the rest of the recording session 

On top of this, I would like a budget of £1,000 to pay for professional marketing and PR assistance throughout the rest of the production
The remaining £500 should cover Indiegogo's commission, with a small amount of contingency funding.


The Impact
 The essence of being a composer is hearing your music performed and enjoyed by others, and to hear my music being played on this scale is not something I've had the opportunity to witness before.
This score has the potential to be a life-changing event for me, and to hear 'The Undercurrent' performed by a professional orchestra will be out of this world. To be able to relive that experience with a recording will be unreal.
In addition to this, there are several other positive impacts:

Having this recording would mean that the ballet can be performed without a live orchestra in smaller venues, bringing it to a wider variety of audiences and stages
We can submit a far more polished pitch by including a professional standard recording to dance companies, orchestras and theatres in order to better our chances of having the work performed.

   Risks & Challenges  Right now, the biggest challenge we face is raising the funding.
Put simply: if we do not fund this project, the recording will not go ahead.
We have taken the following steps to ensure that the risks are eliminated.  We have engaged specialist arts marketing agency Promote Classical to help with the campaign, acting as professional support to ensure we reach the widest audience possible We are using flexible funding, to make sure that every penny raised goes directly towards the project 
   Other Ways You Can Help If you can't afford to contribute, don't worry - we understand entirely! You can still help this campaign out without pledging:  Share this page on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, Pinterest, via Email, smoke signals, post the link to your grandparents, send it by owl or even by using QR codes. Every bit of exposure we get helps enormously.
Get in touch if you think you can recommend 'The Undercurrent' on to anyone else.

In addition to independently funding and releasing my first album, I have contributed and written songs for film, composed a film score and wrote and recorded an Indie/Folk Side Project called Here For Now.

I have performed live numerous times, always working hard to refine the live show and entertain, and at noteworthy venues such as CBGB's, Maxwell's (as a headlining act) &amp; The Bitter End. My live shows have been described as fun, high energy and engaging.</p>
<p>Currently, I am in the process of recording and releasing my second album,"" Stay Calm and Carry On"" and I need YOUR HELP!</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise the necessary funding to complete ""Stay Calm and Carry On"" and to hire the Award Winning Filmmaking team Francisco Productions to film a music video for the first single,""5 Months""</p>
<p>To Thank You for your generous donation, I have listed some great perks for you!</p>

<h3>Why a New Album?</h3>
<center>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mifmusic.com/rw_media/users/photo_gallery/10601-10700/324397.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</center>
<p>""Why not?"", which was actually the counter question from Producer/Engineer/Guitarist Andrew Jaworski when we first met to discuss making an album together. My reply was simple and logical,""Time and Money. Okay, well time I can make happen but really the money"".</p>
<p>After barely paying off my first album and the expenses of pressing a limited number, the last thing I wanted to do was put myself back into a money pit of debt. </p>
<p>Andrew's counter proposal,""Why don't we make the album and worry about the money later?"" </p>
<p>In my head, my first thought was,""Easy for you to say"" but my mouth said,"" Sure, how do you suggest we work it out?""</p>
<p>Andrew and I worked out an agreement that is unusual and not often done in music, if ever. We would begin work on,""Stay Calm and Carry On"" , I would pay as we went along in installments, making sure the session musicians' fees were taken care of and then after everyone had been paid, including the string arranger, yes we had a string section perform on the album, and the master-er, and the results came in, Andrew would be the last man standing for payment. </p>
<p>Such an agreement would not have been possible without an established trust from our friendship and a strong belief that the material was worth sacificing an upfront pay day and possibly a friendship. True to our word, we reconvened in Fall of 2011 to start what would become ,""Stay Calm and Carry On"".</p>
<p>As the sessions began, we knew early on that we were recording a special record, one that we would both be proud to have made. The process of making the album started when we met for a pre-production session to review the songs I had written and discuss possible arrangement ideas. I brought in 17 songs that were whittled down to 13 and then ultimately down to a final 12 songs. </p>
<p>With the aforementioned songs handpicked and agreed upon, Andrew assembled a stellar cast of musicians to participate on the album. Andrew and the musicians were essential in crafting the overall sound. What Andrew and the musicians brought to the songs was a musicianship that didn't previously exist due to my lack of Musical Theory Knowledge and the music greatly benefitted from their arrangements and performances. </p>
<p>Once the recording sessions were wrapped, what remained to be finished was the post-production. Andrew mixed the album with notes from Terence Deutsch and Terence, who has done live sound for Mumford &amp; Sons, mastered the album. It is one thing to capture excellent performances on recording but it is necessary to have it properly mixed and mastered in order to present the music the way it was meant to be heard.</p>
<p>Finished in early 2013, ""Stay Calm and Carry On"" was the most ambitious album that any of us had ever had the pleasure to make. ""Stay Calm and Carry On"" does not sound like a collection of songs made by an indepedent musician but rather an ecletic masterpiece that engages its listeners by indulging them in an auditory experience. With it's overall message of overcoming adversity and heartbreak, it is my sincere hope that anyone listening to the music may find comfort and strength in the songs just as I did in the writing and recording of them.</p>

<p><em><strong>  </strong> </em>To further compliment and introduce ,""Stay Calm and Carry On"", it was only fitting to want to make a proper music video to present the first single,""5 Months"". In thinking about who I wanted to write and direct the music video, I couldn't think of anyone better than Francisco Productions to film it. Francisco Productions' attention to detail, as made evident by their track record of success, had caught my eye. Almost as soon as we had met, we began discussing partnering on creative endeavors. </p>
<p>In addition to Francisco Productions' filming the ""5 Months"" music video, I will be contributing a new original song called,""Seedy"" to their upcoming full length feature film called,""Awful Sexy"". Francisco Productions has previously won an award at the prestigious Cannes Festival for their short film,""An Anomaly of The Theory"".</p>

<p><strong><em>What is my hard-earned money funding?</em></strong><em><em> </em></em></p>
<p>   In order to make an album and a music video, there are several people involved, specialists as I like to refer to them. ""Stay Calm and Carry On"" required us to hire outside musicians that were specialists in their respective fields and also to do the things that we couldn't do on our own such as playing stringed parts like Violin and Cello. Expertise costs money and nobody works for free. In many cases, we reached into our networks and called in favors from friends but even then it was only fair to financially compensate the cast and crew for their hard work and time. Similarly to the end credits of a movie, it requires a team to put together a production.</p>
<p>For ""Stay Calm and Carry On"" I paid all the musicians' expenses, the string arranger and the master-er, however I still need to pay Andrew for his services and Francisco Productions. </p>
<h3>Andew and I Agreed on a $5,000 Budget for the Album</h3>
<h3>I've already paid $2,500 in Musician Fees, Arranger Fee, Mastering Costs, etc. on my own and have gotten the project this far but need your help to complete it.</h3>
<h2>Andrew Jaworski (Producer/Engineer/Musician)- $2,500</h2>
<h2>Franciso Productions (Filmmakers, Cast and Crew)- $2,500</h2>

<h3><em><strong>Testimonials about Joe: </strong></em></h3>
<div style="""">
<p>""My brother and I met Joe Mifsud in 2008, when our artistic lives crossed pathes. Joe wasn't far removed from recording his album,'Mifology' and my brother and I were relatively fresh from the success of 'An Anomaly of The Theory' which premiered in Cannes. We talked about our respective arts, exchanged business cards and developed a mutual respect for one another. Throughout the years, we had discussed eventually working together in some capacity and in 2011 an opportunity presented itself. Joe was beginning work on his latest album,' Stay Calm and Carry On' and we began work on the script to our latest film,' Awful Sexy'. We had mentioned the film to Joe and he was interested in contributing a song to the soundtrack even though we were still working on the script. Joe, inspired from reading the synopsis of the film, wrote and recorded an acoustic version of 'Seedy' and sent it to us. When we heard the song, we knew that he got 'IT'; that he understood what we were trying to convey in the film. Months later, Joe recorded and emailed to us the finished version of 'Seedy' and it was a complete 180 from the original version we heard and I mean that in a good way. 'Seedy' was everything we hope for and more. Joe understood what we wanted and was able to incorporate our direction into the final product and the delivery was on point.""- Gabriel Francisco of Francisco Productions.</p>
<p>""Joe Mifsud came into my life back when I was working at a radio promotions company out in Santa Monica, CA. We met through email and have been in contact ever since. I am a creative mind and tend to gravitate towards people who have the same outlook on life. I'm happy to say Joe and I share a passion towards not only music, but creating art out of what we love. In the years that I've known Joe, he's gone from this musician that I pester about promotion, to a friend. The one thing that has been consistent is his tenacity for hard work. I've watched him focus so much energy and time on non-music thing like jobs and such, just so that he can continue to make music and perform. I look forward to what the future hold for Joe Mifsud and I can't wait until I can say,"" Yeah, I knew him when..."" - Kendra Beltran of Bryan Farrish Radio Promotions and Blogger at Goldenmixtape.com</p>
<p><strong><span><span>""Back in December I met a friend of a friend, Joe Mifsud, as he was collaborating on a music video with cinematographer Matt Rosen for his song 'Bound'. I was a producer on the video and got to hear this and other songs of Joe's while on the shoot. I knew right off the bat that he had talent, but I was impressed with his skill as a guitarist and the care he took with the lyrics of his song, that they came from the heart and had sensitivity to them. That the songs rocked out anyway were a big plus. I had been also at this time working out what songs to use for my feature film 'Green Eyes', and was having trouble with a song that would take the place over a love scene (nothing explicit but tender and stark, a dark scene but with a bluesy feel). I realized Joe was the guy to do it, and after some back and forth on some ideas, and a few demos, he came up with a wonderful song called 'Passion in the Darkest Places'. I couldn't be happier how the experience turned out, and it added something extra to the film I didn't expect as truly soulful. You need that with the blues."" - Jack Gattanella, Writer/Director of Green Eyes</span></span></strong></p>
<p>""Joe Mifsud has been one of my longest collaborators.  I have had the pleasure of working with him on numerous projects.  In the summer of 2006, we shot two music videos together, in locations around the northern New Jersey area as well as down in the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  Following that, Mifsud acted in my first short film, <em>Brothers of Freedom</em>, and created an entirely original soundtrack for the movie.  After a few sessions of sit downs, telling him what I wanted, Mifsud crafted something that helped give the film an aesthetic tone.  After realizing that we could work with one another and challenge each other creatively, Mifsud and I worked on two more films together, the last one being <em>Seeking Nirvana</em>, where he contributed two of his songs.  “Helpless,” which is played near the very end of the film, helped the scenes I matched it with resonate with audiences.  In short, Joe Mifsud is a multi-talented artist who I will always back and vouch for.  He’s got an ear for music and a talent for writing lyrics that I don’t see in most."" - Professor Billy Tooma - Published Poet, Filmmaker </p>

Currently, I am in the process of recording and releasing my second album,"" Stay Calm and Carry On"" and I need YOUR HELP!
This campaign is to raise the necessary funding to complete ""Stay Calm and Carry On"" and to hire the Award Winning Filmmaking team Francisco Productions to film a music video for the first single,""5 Months""

""Why not?"", which was actually the counter question from Producer/Engineer/Guitarist Andrew Jaworski when we first met to discuss making an album together. My reply was simple and logical,""Time and Money. Okay, well time I can make happen but really the money"".
After barely paying off my first album and the expenses of pressing a limited number, the last thing I wanted to do was put myself back into a money pit of debt.

""Joe Mifsud came into my life back when I was working at a radio promotions company out in Santa Monica, CA. We met through email and have been in contact ever since. I am a creative mind and tend to gravitate towards people who have the same outlook on life. I'm happy to say Joe and I share a passion towards not only music, but creating art out of what we love. In the years that I've known Joe, he's gone from this musician that I pester about promotion, to a friend. The one thing that has been consistent is his tenacity for hard work. I've watched him focus so much energy and time on non-music thing like jobs and such, just so that he can continue to make music and perform. I look forward to what the future hold for Joe Mifsud and I can't wait until I can say,"" Yeah, I knew him when..."" - Kendra Beltran of Bryan Farrish Radio Promotions and Blogger at Goldenmixtape.com
""Back in December I met a friend of a friend, Joe Mifsud, as he was collaborating on a music video with cinematographer Matt Rosen for his song 'Bound'. I was a producer on the video and got to hear this and other songs of Joe's while on the shoot. I knew right off the bat that he had talent, but I was impressed with his skill as a guitarist and the care he took with the lyrics of his song, that they came from the heart and had sensitivity to them. That the songs rocked out anyway were a big plus. I had been also at this time working out what songs to use for my feature film 'Green Eyes', and was having trouble with a song that would take the place over a love scene (nothing explicit but tender and stark, a dark scene but with a bluesy feel). I realized Joe was the guy to do it, and after some back and forth on some ideas, and a few demos, he came up with a wonderful song called 'Passion in the Darkest Places'. I couldn't be happier how the experience turned out, and it added something extra to the film I didn't expect as truly soulful. You need that with the blues."" - Jack Gattanella, Writer/Director of Green Eyes
""Joe Mifsud has been one of my longest collaborators.  I have had the pleasure of working with him on numerous projects.  In the summer of 2006, we shot two music videos together, in locations around the northern New Jersey area as well as down in the Outer Banks of North Carolina.  Following that, Mifsud acted in my first short film, Brothers of Freedom, and created an entirely original soundtrack for the movie.  After a few sessions of sit downs, telling him what I wanted, Mifsud crafted something that helped give the film an aesthetic tone.  After realizing that we could work with one another and challenge each other creatively, Mifsud and I worked on two more films together, the last one being Seeking Nirvana, where he contributed two of his songs.  “Helpless,” which is played near the very end of the film, helped the scenes I matched it with resonate with audiences.  In short, Joe Mifsud is a multi-talented artist who I will always back and vouch for.  He’s got an ear for music and a talent for writing lyrics that I don’t see in most."" - Professor Billy Tooma - Published Poet, Filmmaker

<p><strong>HELLO AND THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY MY INDIEGOGO PAGE.</strong></p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I’m Lena Coleman.  If you’re reading this you probably know me, or my parents, or one of my fabulous friends who passed this onto you and are bullying you to donate to help me make my dreams come true. The bare bones info you need to know about me: I’m awesome, I do awesome things and I know awesome people.</p>
<p>The sky is the limit when it comes to what I want to accomplish and what I want to put out in the world, but I thought... baby steps first. This is why I’m starting out with a single release, followed by cutting an EP (a short form album). Recording an album has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember, so this is also an end in itself.  I want to create something. I want to show the world who I am.  I want to make art. However, it will also be a new beginning for me, as I intend to use this record as a calling card to start the first phase of my musical career. I want to play loads of shows, I want to tour, I want to play for you in your hometown, and I want to be on Glee! Having a great sounding album is what is needed to generate that kind of momentum with booking agents, DJs, promoters, and music lovers like you!</p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>In order to embark on my very first recording project, I need funding!  Your contributions will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional recording studio rental fees</li>
<li>Compensation for the engineer's time (recording, overdubs, mixing)</li>
<li>Compensation for all contributing musicians for their time and creativity</li>
<li>Compensation for a mastering engineer's time</li>
<li>Initial set-up costs to distribute the album digitally</li>
<li>Any additional contributions above my goal will go towards PR and Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>Your support will not go unrewarded. Check out the right column for the cool swag and unforgettable experiences you will get in return for your generosity. The money I am raising will be spent solely on bringing my EP to life, I am only raising what I need, not what I want (i.e. that beautiful and ridiculously overpriced whatever I saw on etsy). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are new to IndieGoGo (or other online funding platforms), there are two notable factors to keep in mind that determine the success of this endeavor:</p>
<ul>
<li>IndieGoGo operates on an all-or-nothing model.  This means that the full project goal MUST be met for the artist to receive any of the contributions.  Not 25% of it.  Not 10%.  100% of it.</li>
<li>IndieGoGo takes 4% of each project. A small price to pay for the use of its sleek interface and exposure to its warm and welcoming community.  This 4% IndieGoGo cost has been built into the project goal, along with the items listed in the cost breakdown described above.  By contributing to this project, you provide support to a company that is entirely focused on helping creative minds like you and me get the extra lift we need.</li>
</ul>
<p>From reading this, you've probably noticed that the album doesn't have a title yet. Join in, and this is just part of the inside scoop you'll get from supporting me. I will also be checking in regularly to keep you updated of my progress. So, please spread the word, and I thank you in advance for all your support!</p>
<p>For more information on me, you can check me out on Facebook and Twitter (lenacoleman).</p>
<p><em>A final note: The project goal leaves little room for error.  How far each song gets explored on the EP is entirely dependent on your contributions and whether I exceed my goal.  With that in mind, additional contributions above and beyond our goal will go towards breathing more life into each song, paying musicians what they deserve and marketing the album.</em></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey Everyone! Pam Taylor here! I am so excited about finally getting to work on my CD.  It has been a long time coming.  We go into the studio at the end of October and hope to have it finished by Christmas.  The songs are written and ready to go!  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I figure if we can raise at least $3000 we can put out a quality CD.  We already have some money saved up and along with some donations from some fans already. With this we believe we can cover our expenses.  I have come up with some incentives for you, the contributors, in hopes that you will find them fun and exciting.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We really hate to see the disappointment in people's faces when they come to a show and want to buy a CD.  This is a must for every successful band.  We need a CD to shop to record labels and to even get certain gigs.  So you see just how important this is.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, there are still ways to support us, such as sharing this with your friends on social media websites, coming to our shows or just buying our band merchandise.  We appreciate all the continued support that you have shown us and we hope to continue making music for you.  Thanks again for being our fan! </p>

<h3>Music as Medicine </h3>
<p>I've been writing songs for the past 7 years. Music has always been a way for me to connect to the deeper message of my soul, nature, and the small wise voice within guiding me home. Although I don't play out very often (maybe a few times a year), I do sometimes share in intimate healing song circles, and I've always dreamt of making an album of my music.  </p>
<p>I've been in contact with Eric about recording an album for about a year, and as magic would have it, I ended up at his house just a few weeks ago!  Eric has a professional and fully equipped studio, and the skills to help me make this a beautifully produced album. We've already begun the work on the album, but I need your help to make it epic!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The recording process is very complex and time consuming!  In order to bring the songs to their full potential, I'll also need to hire some musicians, and to compensate Eric for playing various instruments on the track.  To really get the album to sound right, I'll need to have it mixed and mastered, which takes hours of work.  I'm raising funds to help with the costs of studio time, musicians, and the mixing and mastering process. </p>
<p>How $3,333 will be spent:</p>
<p>$3,000: Production and post production; recording, editing, mixing, mastering, additional musicians, and making CDs.</p>
<p>$333: Album artwork</p>
<p>Any additional funds raised will go towards making the album even more awesome (more musicians, etc). It may mean that I make the album 8 tracks instead of 6 (or even 10!).  Extra funds could also go towards covering indiegogo fees, setting up a music website, or extra unforeseen studio costs.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal #1: $4,444: </strong>$1,000 would go towards recording an additional 2 songs</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal #2: $5,555: </strong>$1,000 would go towards building a website, covering indiegogo fees, and adding more layers to the songs.</p>
<p>There are some really fun and unique perks for contributing!  A number of my friends are donating some of their amazing gifts such as readings, specialty products, and more!  I'm also offering some free coaching services. If there are still people that would like to donate gifts as perks, I am still receiving donors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've already begun the process of recording, and I intend to finish the album by the end of September.  My hope is that these songs will touch peoples hearts, and help them to tune more deeply into their soul essence. I believe that when we live from the heart, the world is a better place.</p>

Now we want to take it up a notch. We need your help to commission Annie Gosfield for a new piece inspired by one of Detroit’s most prized artworks, the DIA’s “Detroit Industry” murals.</p><h3>Break it down now!</h3><p>You’re just like us, you love new music! That’s why we came up with a bunch of rewards we know you’ll love. The Knight Arts Challenge is just that: a challenge to engage our community and draw on your support to make exciting, strange, new music that is unique to Detroit. When you give to our campaign, you’re helping us generate new Detroit-centric music by a major composer AND getting access to an incredible spectrum of rewards, such as…</p><ul>
<li>Next-generation NMD t-shirts</li>
<li>Flashdrive roulette (with some super exclusive stuff from the archives)</li>
<li>Our forthcoming Marc Mellits album and access to the release party on April 2 at El Club</li>
<li>Strange Beautiful Music swag and superfan care packages</li>
<li>And you could even pick a song for us to cover, yes any song.</li>
</ul><h3>Iconic work, important meaning</h3><p>Odds are that anyone from Detroit will have a relative who worked in the auto industry. You don’t need to look hard at Rivera’s murals to see the message: that working <i>together</i>, we can achieve incredible things. Detroit Industry depicts the Ford Assembly Line, a place where anyone could come to work and everyone played and important part. It didn’t matter who you were, you could sign up and get that famous $5-a-day wage. These murals have become one of the city’s most beloved pieces of art and we think the message is worthy of celebrating with new music!</p><p>So why Annie Gosfield, you ask? First off, Annie has long been inspired by the Rivera murals and has always wanted to write for them. Secondly, to put it simply, her music <i>is</i> ""industrial"". She has a distinctly futuristic way of using sounds that we absolute love and that makes her music as innovative &amp; timely as ever.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514266484/avqahvyr0wh3hytdnepi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Annie is also one of the most important voices in the current American new music scene. She recently premiered her new opera ""War of the Worlds"" with the LA Philharmonic, to top-notch reviews -- just the latest in a long string of accolades &amp; accomplishments. As NMD looks to work with the most significant composers of our time, Annie -- whose work so creatively balances art and industry -- was an obvious choice for this project.</p><p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Along with a considerable amount of tender loving care, New Music Detroit is able to pull off big projects like Detroit Industry with support from our community, contributors, and friends. The Knight Foundation has agreed to fund half of the project, but we need your help to raise the other half!</p><p>NMD’s got a big 2018 lined up - helping us with this campaign ensures we can do the other stuff too, like:</p><ul>
<li>Another 3-day Strange Beautiful Music in September</li>
<li>Our new Marc Mellits album (forthcoming in April)</li>
<li>Performances in new areas of the city and beyond</li>

Now we want to take it up a notch. We need your help to commission Annie Gosfield for a new piece inspired by one of Detroit’s most prized artworks, the DIA’s “Detroit Industry” murals.Break it down now!You’re just like us, you love new music! That’s why we came up with a bunch of rewards we know you’ll love. The Knight Arts Challenge is just that: a challenge to engage our community and draw on your support to make exciting, strange, new music that is unique to Detroit. When you give to our campaign, you’re helping us generate new Detroit-centric music by a major composer AND getting access to an incredible spectrum of rewards, such as…
Next-generation NMD t-shirts
Flashdrive roulette (with some super exclusive stuff from the archives)
Our forthcoming Marc Mellits album and access to the release party on April 2 at El Club
Strange Beautiful Music swag and superfan care packages
And you could even pick a song for us to cover, yes any song.
Iconic work, important meaningOdds are that anyone from Detroit will have a relative who worked in the auto industry. You don’t need to look hard at Rivera’s murals to see the message: that working together, we can achieve incredible things. Detroit Industry depicts the Ford Assembly Line, a place where anyone could come to work and everyone played and important part. It didn’t matter who you were, you could sign up and get that famous $5-a-day wage. These murals have become one of the city’s most beloved pieces of art and we think the message is worthy of celebrating with new music!So why Annie Gosfield, you ask? First off, Annie has long been inspired by the Rivera murals and has always wanted to write for them. Secondly, to put it simply, her music is ""industrial"". She has a distinctly futuristic way of using sounds that we absolute love and that makes her music as innovative & timely as ever.Annie is also one of the most important voices in the current American new music scene. She recently premiered her new opera ""War of the Worlds"" with the LA Philharmonic, to top-notch reviews -- just the latest in a long string of accolades & accomplishments. As NMD looks to work with the most significant composers of our time, Annie -- whose work so creatively balances art and industry -- was an obvious choice for this project. Risks & ChallengesAlong with a considerable amount of tender loving care, New Music Detroit is able to pull off big projects like Detroit Industry with support from our community, contributors, and friends. The Knight Foundation has agreed to fund half of the project, but we need your help to raise the other half!NMD’s got a big 2018 lined up - helping us with this campaign ensures we can do the other stuff too, like:
Another 3-day Strange Beautiful Music in September

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi! I am a Portuguese vocalist, composer, improviser working  in the field of jazz, improvised and experimental music since first arriving in New York in 2008. I am launching this campaign to raise funds to record my new album, <strong><i>Recognition.</i></strong></p>

<h3>What is Recognition?</h3>
<p><strong><i>Recognition</i></strong> is an interdisciplinary project,  in which music and image highlighted with texts by revolutionary Amílcar Cabral, invite the viewer/ listener to reflect on history in a non-literal way.  </p>
<p>I produced <strong><i>Recognition</i></strong>  using Super 8 footage filmed by my grandfather, in Angola and Portugal in the 60’s, by then a fascist and colonizer regime.

<p>Mastering Session</p>
<p>Vinyl + CD  Printing</p>
<p>I envision the digital release of the film with music, with the option of supporters purchasing the audio file as mp3 or vinyl, DVD, CD with or without access to the film. The release of this album is scheduled for December 2019.

<p>Talking about Angola and Portugal, is talking about Brazil, United States and Europe - the western world shares a collective shameful past of occupation, exploitation, slave trade, oppression, racism, segregation, violence and abuse.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction
Hi! I am a Portuguese vocalist, composer, improviser working  in the field of jazz, improvised and experimental music since first arriving in New York in 2008. I am launching this campaign to raise funds to record my new album, Recognition.
 
What is Recognition?
Recognition is an interdisciplinary project,  in which music and image highlighted with texts by revolutionary Amílcar Cabral, invite the viewer/ listener to reflect on history in a non-literal way.  
I produced Recognition  using Super 8 footage filmed by my grandfather, in Angola and Portugal in the 60’s, by then a fascist and colonizer regime. I then composed the music for the film and invited the amazing Zeena Parkins (harp), Mark Turner (tenor sax) and David Virelles (piano) to perform it.
This extraordinary ensemble probes deep into the emotional core of this era through scored material and flowing improvisation. The project questions the collective amnesia on Europe’s colonial past. Recognition invites all for reflection on history through music, film and text, 
We have presented Recognition live during the year of 2018 at The Drawing Center (curated by John Zorn), Winter Jazz Festival 2018, Alwan For the Arts (curated by Amir Elsaffar) and The Kitchen (curated by Vijay Iyer). 
Now it is time to document it and record the music, so Recognition can be available to everyone. 

 
What I am asking for?
For this recording to happen I need to raise  $8000 to support the following costs:
1 Day in Studio
4 Musicians + 1 Engineer (Pete Rende) Fees
Mixing Session
Mastering Session
Vinyl + CD  Printing
I envision the digital release of the film with music, with the option of supporters purchasing the audio file as mp3 or vinyl, DVD, CD with or without access to the film. The release of this album is scheduled for December 2019. Pre-ordering your Digital Download, CD, Vinyl, Flashdrive, etc... means you are contributing directly to this recording. I hope you can join me on this campaign!
 

Why did I create Recognition?
Talking about Angola and Portugal, is talking about Brazil, United States and Europe - the western world shares a collective shameful past of occupation, exploitation, slave trade, oppression, racism, segregation, violence and abuse.
I created Recognition:
- to bring awareness to general audiences, making them listen, see, reflect and recognize privilege and inherited structures of racism,  silently and deliberately perpetuated through present times.
- to bear witness to the events that passed and the legacy of colonialism, particularly in a moment of rising nationalist and white supremacists movements.
- to highlight the power of music as a tool for social evolution, reflection and education.
- To break the silence about Portuguese Colonialism and institutional racism. Empathy and emotional contagion during music listening are crucial to this piece. Listening (opposed to silencing) means to deliberately channel attention toward a sound. 
 
 With music, the silence is broken.
 
When will it be ready?

Our studio session is scheduled to July 2nd 2019. The album will be released in December 2019. As a backer of this project, you will have access to everything as soon as it is ready, which will be around September 2019.
 

How can you help?
Any contribution is greatly appreciated, but if you are unable to contribute, here are a few ways you can help out:

Spread the word, and share the links with your friends and family.

<p>I'm thrilled with this album and want to make sure it gets heard. I've learned the hard way that if you don't promote an album well, very few people even learn that it is available. But it takes money to promote an album well.

There's a great team excited about helping me make sure this album gets noticed but I've had to turn many of them down because I can't afford them. </p>
<p>That's where you come in.

From 1980-95, I managed bands with contracts with EMI and Island Records and then stopped it all to do international social development work for fifteen years with various United Nations agencies and international NGOs. Since moving to Brighton, England in January 2013, I have entered the music business again and am happily developing these two emerging alternative folk acts - House of Hats (<a href=""http://www.houseofhatsmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.houseofhatsmusic.com/</a>) and Carrie Tree (<a href=""http://carrietree.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://carrietree.co.uk/</a>).</h3><p>Both bands are doing their first UK tour in February 2014. The tour will visit 20 cities over four weeks. This will not be a luxury tour by any means with tour bus, 5 star hotels, etc. but it still is very expensive to tour - especially when you are an emerging talent and most of your live performance fees are minimal. We need to cover transportation, petrol, accommodation for eight people, per diems and booking agency fees.</p><p>In the music business, touring, getting covered in the press and getting radio play are all strongly linked. Radio stations want to know that you are touring in order for them to start playing you - journalists want to know that you are touring for them to start reviewing you. Doing this tour is so important for both bands because it will be the key link to starting to get national and regional press coverage and radio play! They already have been getting great attention from the press here in Brighton due to their strong live shows and I am convinced that they will generate the same interest if they tour the UK. Even the BBC has recently invited both bands to perform on radio shows due to the buzz they have created in Brighton!</p><p>So we need £19,500 to cover the costs of eight musicians on the road for one month, covering the length of the United Kingdom. We are offering some great perks that range from pre-release digital albums, signed set lists from the tour, your name personally thanked in the album credits AND your own song recorded for you on Youtube in a 40 minute private concert by both band beamed into your living room via wide angle, HD Skype webcam!</p><p>If we don't reach our goal, we will use what we get to go out on tour anyhow - we just might have to eat less, do eight to a hotel room instead of four and maybe run out of petrol a few times! In all seriousness, if we don't reach our goal, then we will shorten the tour according to the budget that we receive and do a shorter tour of a few of the biggest cities. And, you will still get your relevant perk that you qualified for!</p><p>Just last week we received interest from promoters in New York and Los Angeles to bring both bands to the States. This UK tour will only help those prospects because of the story that will unfold through press reviews and radio play. You will have not only helped us tour the UK but will be helping us get our foot into the door of America as well. In addition, whenever anyone experiences House of Hats or Carrie Tree they describe their live shows with ''a real feel-good experience'' and ''I feel like I have just been hugged by the band''.

We play what you might call Modern Vintage Rock music — original songs that embrace the past while keeping an eye on the future. We’d really love for you to hear exactly what that sounds like, but we have one small problem:</p><p>Our previous releases don’t sound like us anymore.

In order to get this music to your ears in the near future, we’re asking you to consider pre-ordering your copy today. And if you’re feeling extra generous, we’ve set up some great perks and rewards for contributions that go above and beyond the cost of the CD itself. It’s that kind of support that will ultimately take these songs from a recording studio in Langley, BC to a finished CD you can enjoy later this year (estimated release date: Fall 2014).</p><p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""><b>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</b></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">This is a very expensive process that is already well underway, and we’re determined to do it right. The amount we’re looking to raise will cover a variety of things — first and foremost all of our remaining studio and production costs. Additional funds will be allocated for the equally important elements of artwork, printing, packaging, and promotion. And if we exceed our $8000 goal, we’ll even be able to consider additional projects such as music videos, extended touring, and producing additional album merchandise such as vinyl printings and t-shirts!</span></p><p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""><b>WHAT YOU GET</b></i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">To show our gratitude for your support, we want to give back to you in all the best ways we know how. This is a pre-order campaign after all, so every contribution of $10 or higher will get you a copy of our new album on CD and digital download. For those who contribute more, we’re throwing open the doors and inviting you in to experience every aspect of life as a No Islander.

There are no words to fully express how much gratitude we have for each and every one of you who helped make this happen. You guys are the best, and we'll be keeping all of you in mind as we finish crafting Better Days. Thanks to you, this album is going to ROCK!With many humble thanks, - No IslandHey everyone!We’re No Island, a five-piece indie rock band from Vancouver. We play what you might call Modern Vintage Rock music — original songs that embrace the past while keeping an eye on the future. We’d really love for you to hear exactly what that sounds like, but we have one small problem:Our previous releases don’t sound like us anymore. In fact, they don’t even have all of us on them. We’re currently in the process of recording a full-length CD of all new material, but we’ve hit a financial roadblock. In order to get this music to your ears in the near future, we’re asking you to consider pre-ordering your copy today. And if you’re feeling extra generous, we’ve set up some great perks and rewards for contributions that go above and beyond the cost of the CD itself. It’s that kind of support that will ultimately take these songs from a recording studio in Langley, BC to a finished CD you can enjoy later this year (estimated release date: Fall 2014).WHY WE NEED YOUR HELPThis is a very expensive process that is already well underway, and we’re determined to do it right. The amount we’re looking to raise will cover a variety of things — first and foremost all of our remaining studio and production costs. Additional funds will be allocated for the equally important elements of artwork, printing, packaging, and promotion. And if we exceed our $8000 goal, we’ll even be able to consider additional projects such as music videos, extended touring, and producing additional album merchandise such as vinyl printings and t-shirts!WHAT YOU GETTo show our gratitude for your support, we want to give back to you in all the best ways we know how. This is a pre-order campaign after all, so every contribution of $10 or higher will get you a copy of our new album on CD and digital download. For those who contribute more, we’re throwing open the doors and inviting you in to experience every aspect of life as a No Islander. Perks include getting the album ahead of its official release date, exclusive bonus tracks and unseen content, and even hanging out with us for a van ride, dinner, or a private concert.

<p>I'm thrilled with this album and want to make sure it gets heard. I've learned the hard way that if you don't promote an album well, very few people even learn that it is available. But it takes money to promote an album well. It costs thousands of dollars to do publicity or send songs to just one radio format, for instance. Here what <a href=""http://bit.ly/SF1301"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Soul Furnace Report 01.30.13"">backers like you have helped me accomplish so far</a> and <a href=""http://bit.ly/SFRSFOM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Sweet Friend Of Mine Soul Furnace Report"">what I'm hoping to do next at radio</a>. There's a great team excited about helping me make sure this album gets noticed but I've had to turn many of them down because I can't afford them. </p>
<p>That's where you come in. You could look for the album in stores but you'll get fewer songs, none of the extras and you won't get the higher quality audio files that are included in the downloads here. <a href=""http://bit.ly/whybdcrowdfunds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Why We Use This Model For Conversations"">Here's why this model works better and is essential to my getting to interact with you more and to my ability to continue to record</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve got some great rewards for individuals, churches and charities -- something for everyone. Each one has a different delivery date so you'll know when you should receive it. Check them out over there. --&gt;<br/><br/>You can also invite me to your town - for a Conversation or a concert. You’ll find the details–yep, you guessed it–right over there. --&gt;</p>
<p>Click a ""Claim This Perk"" button to see more information about ordering it, delivery dates, etc. If you pay by credit card, Indiegogo doesn't complete the transaction until several days after the campaign ends, so your delivery date is after that. If you use PayPal, the delivery date will be earlier than the one posted. </p>

<p>You betcha! Indiegogo allows you specify who you want the perk sent to and indicate that it is a gift. You can even include a note for the recipient of your gift.</p>

Williams and Tony Hooper (Blues Counsel) at 7:00 pm on August 16 and August 17 at ExerienceChurch.tv in Puyallup, WA. Seating is very limited, so don't miss out. Read more about my special guest artists and hear their music here.
Join me and share the pre-concert VIP Experience.
Here's something else exciting...I'm planning to do an audio and video recording of the event! So, don't miss your chance to be there!
I'd love for you to be there with your family and friends. Please share this page and choose the perk you want, including concert tickets, a VIP experience, my new album, the new Sweet Comfort Band CD and more. Each perk has details on how and when you'll receive it. You can even suggest a custom-designed perk.---->
I've got a new album called Conversations (listen here), featuring the song I See You, that you can get now. You'll receive extra songs (for a total of 21 on the download), bonus features and better quality audio. Why should you get the album now? See my video about this album. Watch new music videos here and videos of some of my classic songs from past albums here.
I'm thrilled with this album and want to make sure it gets heard. I've learned the hard way that if you don't promote an album well, very few people even learn that it is available. But it takes money to promote an album well. It costs thousands of dollars to do publicity or send songs to just one radio format, for instance. Here what backers like you have helped me accomplish so far and what I'm hoping to do next at radio. There's a great team excited about helping me make sure this album gets noticed but I've had to turn many of them down because I can't afford them. 
That's where you come in. You could look for the album in stores but you'll get fewer songs, none of the extras and you won't get the higher quality audio files that are included in the downloads here. Here's why this model works better and is essential to my getting to interact with you more and to my ability to continue to record.
I’ve got some great rewards for individuals, churches and charities -- something for everyone. Each one has a different delivery date so you'll know when you should receive it. Check them out over there. -->You can also invite me to your town - for a Conversation or a concert. You’ll find the details–yep, you guessed it–right over there. -->
Click a ""Claim This Perk"" button to see more information about ordering it, delivery dates, etc. If you pay by credit card, Indiegogo doesn't complete the transaction until several days after the campaign ends, so your delivery date is after that. If you use PayPal, the delivery date will be earlier than the one posted. 
Thanks again for your interest in my music.  Please share this page with your friends... choose the cool stuff you want... and check out some of the songs on my Conversations album.

<h3>Who are we and what are we doing?</h3>
<p>We are Post Mortem Delirium, a  Horror Punk band from the Gulf Coast city of Mobile, AL, comprised of three members: Andy Scott, Drums; Kevin ""Buzz"" Olsen, Bass and backing vocals; Jesse Bones, Guitars and vocals. We all have one goal, to take this project another step forward and record a quality album we can be proud to share with you, the fans!</p>
<p>The idea for this band started some years ago and finally began to come to fruition in the Summer of 2013 with current members Jesse and Buzz as part of the founding line-up. Several line-up changes in the first year and a half set back any sort of studio sessions which would have occurred. With the recent addition of Andy on drums,  we are now fully equipped to record our first album.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is your help needed? </h3>
<p>With just two days to go before we take to the studio and just a few days of funds to get us started, we are needing to raise extra funds to help us finish the album and to press and master the album.</p>
<p>$2,500 dollars is what we need to bring everything to light. This money will fulfill the cost of extra studio time to finish recording, the cost of mastering and pressing the album, along with miscellaneous expenses that come with completing this campaign.</p>
<p>We want to give you something tangible with our perks and things that can create memories. We're not exactly looking for handouts here. We want to give back to those who are willing to go to bat for us and our cause!</p>

<p><span>When I look at a photograph, if just for a moment, I believe I can understand what the artist felt when he or she captured it.  This is one of the inspirations for this project. There is so much natural beauty that is constantly changing and evolving, and I believe it is my time to capture it and share it with the world.  This adventure will take us to 13 National Parks; we will see lakes, rivers, mountains, a rainforest, deserts, sand dunes, and so much more.  It's not to say this hasn’t been done before, but not by me, and I hope to bring my own creative edge to this subject matter.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>There are many goals for a project of this magnitude.   First, I hope to create a photography book using images from our travels to expose the beauty of these National Parks.  I will also be creating a Time Lapse Video using video from all the parks.  Additionally,  I will be exploring Infrared (IR) technology with a dedicated IR converted camera.  This will hopefully create a large and diverse body of work.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Another goal is to further illuminate the effects we are having on the environment and the delicate ecosystem of the National Parks.  Preservation of Scenery is a goal of the National Park Services, and has been since Yellowstone became the first National Park in 1872.  However, when the goal is to preserve the scenery for tourists, there is an effect on the ecosystem.  The scenery, or facade, of most of these parks will not be the same in 50 years.  If I am able to capture the beauty of the scenery as it is now, just maybe we can help facilitate the preservation of our amazing National Parks System.  </span></p>

<p>  Selah Gospel Choir is an all inclusive community gospel choir that needs your support to continue sharing the art of traditional and contemporary gospel music!  </p>
<p><strong>Who we are: </strong></p>
<p>  Selah Gospel Choir was formed in 2007 by two individuals who had a vision for a multi-cultural, multi-generational, interfaith group of vocalists sharing a passion for gospel music. Selah has now grown in spirit and in number to 40 members from all over the Los Angeles area. Circling around central values such as love, diversity and community, SGC demonstrates these values as they sing for a purpose greater than themselves.  This vibrant, fun, and challenging ensemble strives to remain true and authentic to the traditional and contemporary gospel form of music.  </p>
<p>Enough of what we think, read the concert reviews from the community who we continue to touch and inspire:  </p>
<p>- ""fervent and poignant, emotive and bewitching"" </p>
<p>-""This group is uplifting, harmonious, and inspirational. That BIG sound they produce envelops the whole room. Selah Gospel Choir is colorful and beautifully enjoying the music they make together. They transported me to a sweet bliss.""</p>
<p>-""That choir had me dancing in the aisles!""</p>
<p> - ""...those 2 hours were totally uplifting and like a vacation for my soul."" </p>
<p>  <strong>Why we need your support:</strong></p>
<p>  Each year, Selah Gospel Choir performs Spring and Fall concerts to bring hope and encouragement to the community. In order to continue making music and sharing our voices, our choir needs to raise $5000. The Altos hope to raise $2500 through your support and donations and the additional $2500 through other fundraising efforts. <em>Your money will directly affect our dire financial situation and help pay the for rehearsal space, performance venues, union wages for musicians for the concert and our publicity. This money will also go into a prudent reserve to prevent our organization from going into debt</em>.   If we do not reach our goal, we will unfortunately no longer be able to continue as Selah Gospel Choir thus making our Spring 2013 concert our final season. Any money that is donated will still be used to to cover the expenses of our Spring performance. Therefore, we are asking for your support now more than ever! Please know that any support you can offer will go a long way toward changing the lives of others through music--  You'll also get some great perks for your contribution! </p>
<p><strong>  Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></p>
<p>  If you are unable to give financially, that's okay! You can still help by promoting and sharing our IndieGoGo fundraising link with your social network/friends and encourage them to do the same.</p>

<strong>What’s up Guys!</strong> We are A Breathless September a pop/punk band based out of Pittsburgh, PA. We started this group less than 2 years ago in the summer of 2011. It started with Leo and Brandon and eventually we got Eric and Everett after a few lineup changes. Soon after forming A Breathless September we managed to write and record a 6-Track EP titled “<em>Affinity For Asphyxiation</em>”.  We also released a single titled “<em>Cry Wolf</em>” late last year. The past year as a band has been a great year, we have played numerous shows with National Touring Acts after building a relationship with Concert Chaos, and we have also met a lot of great people and musicians along the way. </h3>
<h2>Why did we start this campaign ?</h2>
<h2>Well this campaign was created to help fund the recording and production of our new full length CD. Shortly after we released our single “<em>Cry Wolf</em>” we shot it out to a bunch of different record labels.  We soon got a response from a well-recognized label. We were all very excited after receiving this email. After some discussing and emailing back a forth we were offered a deal that we couldn’t turn down.  We have been scoping out different studios for a good while now in hopes to record our full length album and to have the opportunity to record and produce it with a well-recognized professional studio is just an awesome opportunity that no band could turn down. This is a big step for us to be able to record and release a full length album with a professional label and we are hoping that by doing this it may lead to bigger and better things.</h2>
<h3>We hope by you guys reading this you might want to help contribute and we appreciate any initiative you take to help us reach our goal whether it is spreading the word by telling your friends or donating to our fund. We appreciate your support to the fullest! Your contributions in helping us reach our goal will give us the opportunity to make an awesome Full Length Album for our fans and also get some awesome prizes in return for your donations!  </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>We are asking for help in raising a total of $4,500. This will cover all the costs of the Producer, the mixing/mastering, and any additional fees we might have while we are out of state for 2 weeks.  The normal cost to record a full length CD at a professional studio can be anywhere from $7,000 to $20,000 so we are getting an amazing deal on our part. We also have some pretty awesome perks for each contribution you make to our fund. Some perks you may receive for donating: Free CD’s , T-Shirts, Digital Downloads, Free shows for 1 year, a feature in our next music video,  special thanks in our CD, house show, and a snare drum and guitar used in the recording of our full length will be some of the many prizes you can receive in return for your donations !!</h3>
<h3>In the situation of us not reaching our goal if this were to happen we would still use all the funds raised to the recording of our Full Length CD. This might make our time of recording later which could set us back a bit but no matter what we plan on recording our New CD and getting it out to you guys as quick as possible and any contribution you guys make just make us that much closer to making this happen!</h3>
<h3>After reaching our goal and completing the recording of our next CD we will have a ton of new merch and music to get out to you guys whether it be at shows or by you obtaining our stuff online. We hope that our new record will gain us a lot more exposure in the music scene. We spent a lot of days and nights writing and writing hoping to get to this point and we are finally there. We really think you guys will like our new stuff. It’s a lot more in your face and hard hitting then the last CD we released and we know you guys will really enjoy it.  This is an awesome opportunity for our fans to be a part of something big. We want you guys to feel like you are a part of ABS and we love all the support we have gotten over the past 2 years. </h3>
<h3>If you took the time to check out our fundraiser please help by sharing on facebook, twitter, or any means to get the word out and have our fundraiser known. The more people that are aware the greater chance we have of reaching our goal.</h3>
<h3>We can’t express how much your support means to us. Stay updated on our progress through some of the links below !</h3>

<h3>What’s Up with the Guitar Bottle?</h3>
<p><strong>A few years ago we thought it up</strong> and since then have been designing it and refining it.  It’s done.  Our bottle is actually two highly crafted glass bottles.  Everybody loves this bottle, and everybody wants one.  We want you to have one too!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/201060/files/20131115212640-2.jpg?1384579600"" src="""" style=""width: 565.51px; height: 228px;""/></p>
<p><strong>The bottles we make as pledge rewards</strong> with the funding from this campaign will all be distributed as empty decanters.  However, since we are a start-up tequila company we have designed the bottle so that we can fill it with tequila too...  </p>
<p>So... the bottom (guitar body part) can hold 750ml of one flavor of tequila and for the top (guitar head stock part) we put another bottle with a 50mL sample of some other tequila flavor.  The top also serves as a cork for the bottle, and can be refilled.  Again, all that said, all bottles offered here are empty and contain no alcohol.</p>

<h3>Help Us Keep the Party Going!</h3>
<p><strong>We now have one of the best rock n roll related products</strong> hitting the market, but we've spent most of our money to get here.  That's why we really need you to become a Rock N Roll Founding Member and help us get our company off the ground. <strong>Get on the tour with us!</strong>  It's our dream to some day be a huge brand, and now by pledging you can play a big part in turning our dreams into that reality.</p>
<p><em><strong>___________________________________________________________________</strong></em></p>
<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p><strong>We are a small start-up brand</strong> and for about a year we have been selling (fairly small-time) our Rock N Roll products in our distinctive guitar bottles.  We are trying to establish ourselves as a huge tequila brand recognized all over, and be a real player in our market.  We think we must be onto something too because we now have the blessings and license from Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE) to create our Elvis bottles, boxes and tequila adorned with the King Of Rock N Roll Elvis Presley image and name.</p>
<em><strong><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/134718/files/20131015115101-48406e1e5b1ced1d1a34bd5dd7f6a072_large.jpg?1381863061"" src="""" style=""width: 93.65px; height: 119px;""/></p></strong></em><h4>Who is Andy?</h4>
<p><strong>Way back when</strong>, our company's co-owner Andy Herbst used to help out in the promotion of concerts (even legends like Jimi Hendrix, The Doors and the Eagles) and ever since Andy has been involved in some way with rock bands, concerts or recording music.  Whether he was pushing the broom, tearing tickets at the door or organizing the whole damn event, he was totally loving it.  Even though he can't sing a note, Andy actually has a great ear for rock music.  We could go on and on about how much we like him, or how nice and humble and generous he is, and all the amazing things he's done in his life, or all the people he knows.  But trust us...  Andy is the perfect person to make this company successful.  Anyone that knows him will agree.</p>
<em><strong><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/134719/files/20131015115128-6d219fbd43f6e1c27831d8e2be91ff85_large.jpg?1381863088"" src="""" style=""""/></p></strong></em><h4>Who is Keith?</h4>
<p><strong>Keith Impink is the starving artist guy</strong> behind the look and feel of everything we do.  Keith designed our bottle, our boxes and all our logos and labels. He’s an artist, musician, songwriter type, but is probably best known for all the rock posters and art he has designed for rocker legends like Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Goo Goo Dolls, Jackson Brown, Bonnie Raitt and tons of others.  He probably made next to nothing from all that work, but he has been on the fringes of rock n roll promotion for decades which is good for us!  Keith also does our posters, ads, promotional materials, the Elvis art and he handles our web stuff too. He even created most of this page.  <a href=""http://www.impink.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">View his portfolio here at impink.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We don't have any employees,</strong> but we do have friends helping us out like Jose.  Jose is our master distiller and he has a factory in Mexico ready to make our  tequila, and he handles most of the customs and border stuff too.  So here's a shout-out thanks to Jose, Dennis, Mandy, Gordon, Jay C, Mark, Bret, Tom, Justin, Bob, Bob L., our friends, family, everyone who posed with our bottle, and all of you who helped us make our video... kudos!</p>
<p><strong><em>___________________________________________________________________</em></strong></p>
<h3>What Are We Trying to Do?</h3>
<p><strong>So far, we've used our own money</strong> for the design and manufacturing of prototype bottles and packaging.  It's cost us just about everything to cover the development, licensing, designs, website and tons of legal stuff just to get to this point.  We did it though wholeheartedly because we really believe in our Rock N Roll products.  And we know we have a rock solid plan.  And you are a major part of our plan.  We're ready to rock, are you ready to roll?  See us on <a href=""http://www.elvis.com/news/detail.aspx?id=7265"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elvis.com.</a></p>
<p><strong>Our project is</strong> to have made a 40 foot truckload of Elvis Presley branded Rock N Roll decanters, and of course ship it here so we can box it, case it and make ready for sales.  We flat-out don't have the money to make this happen!  That's why we need your help.</p>
<p><strong>Our project also includes</strong> having empty limited edition Founding Member bottles and collectors Elvis boxes made for you.  In fact, a huge part of this project is to reward you with creative collectibles and adventures you can't buy anywhere.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/201072/files/20131115214424-6.jpg?1384580664"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><em>___________________________________________________________________</em></strong></p>
<h3>Why Elvis?</h3>
<p><strong>Simply put, Elvis is the ""King of Rock N Roll""</strong> and is without a doubt the most recognizable Rock N Roll icon of all time... and we love Elvis.  Are you a huge fan like we are?... Then you'll appreciate the quality of everything about our Elvis bottle. We really feel that our product showcases Elvis and honors his legacy.  Rock N Roll Tequila is a tribute to ""The King"".  See us on <a href=""http://www.elvis.com/news/detail.aspx?id=7265"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elvis.com</a>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/134758/files/20131015120200-88e4eb11124bc9be9d39861c3e5027db_large.jpg?1381863720"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>We spent a lot of time building the relationships</strong> needed to make this happen, and have put in a lot of effort to get to this point.  The folks at Elvis (EPE) and Graceland are really happy with us and have given us a green light.  We think Elvis would be proud of what we have done and think he would want you to have your own collectible Founding Members guitar bottle available here by supporting our project.</p>
<p><em><strong>___________________________________________________________________</strong></em></p>
<h3>Do We Have Fun?</h3>
<p><em><strong>You tell us....</strong></em> If we’re not participating in a party or event, you may find us on one of our many Rock N Roll Bus Tours, where we charter a big bus, crank the music and travel with our fans to rock n roll concerts.  Is this fun?  We think so.  We get to listen to the best rock music all day long, hang out with musicians, artists, DJs, promoters and all sorts of cool people.</p>
<p><strong>Rock N Roll Tequila is a product that brings fun to every party</strong> we go to, and we actually have fans!  One thing we like to do for fun is sneak backstage as much as possible to show off our bottle to the bands and musicians.  Rockstars always love the bottle, and they always want to pose with it.  That's how we got these pictures here.  thanks guys:)</p>

<h3>We Don't Just Look Good, Our Flavors are Awesome!</h3>
<p><strong>All of our Tequilas are made with 100% pure agave</strong> and are available in Blanco, Mango and Coffee flavors.  With your help, we plan to dominate the mid-priced tequila market with Rock N Roll Tequila.  We're not kidding, people really like what we are doing here.  We have great taste, the coolest bottle ever made, and Elvis.</p>
<p><em><strong>___________________________________________________________________</strong></em></p>
<h3>How Will The Money Be Spent?</h3>
<p><strong>We've done a lot...</strong> the designs, the patents, certification of flavors, label approvals, trademarks... and we now have the Guitar Bottle and molds... it's almost done!</p>
<p>•  There are pledge costs and fees associated with servicing this campaign such as the PERKS, shirts, bottles, boxes, printing, travel tickets, shipping etc. <br/>•  We need money primarily to get a 40 foot truckload of Rock N Roll Elvis decanter bottles and Elvis boxes printed, packed and ready for shipping. <br/>•  We also need your help to pay for essential marketing, promotion and advertising. <br/>•  There are also fees for Indiegogo and campaign related costs.</p>
<p><em><strong>___________________________________________________________________</strong></em></p>
<h3>Why Are We So Great?</h3>
<p><strong><em>•  We Have Music Fans.</em></strong>  We have a brand name closely associated with rock n roll music and it's built-in base of rock n roll fans.  Isn't this billions of people?<br/><strong><em>•  We Have Approvals.</em></strong>  We have utility and design patents pending on our guitar shaped bottle features in many countries.  We have labels approved by TTB and CRT for all of our flavors and in all the sizes.  We have trademarks and all that stuff too. <br/><strong><em>•  We Have Elvis Presley.</em></strong>  We have a sweet licensing deal with Elvis Presley Enterprises and therefore a built-in Elvis fan base.

<p> Elvis Presley used under license © EPE REG. U.S. PAT &amp; TM OFF</p></span></span></span></div>","Our Elvis Presley Bottle Rocks... Help Us Rock The World!

What’s Up with the Guitar Bottle?
A few years ago we thought it up and since then have been designing it and refining it.  It’s done.  Our bottle is actually two highly crafted glass bottles.  Everybody loves this bottle, and everybody wants one.  We want you to have one too!

The bottles we make as pledge rewards with the funding from this campaign will all be distributed as empty decanters.  However, since we are a start-up tequila company we have designed the bottle so that we can fill it with tequila too...  
So... the bottom (guitar body part) can hold 750ml of one flavor of tequila and for the top (guitar head stock part) we put another bottle with a 50mL sample of some other tequila flavor.  The top also serves as a cork for the bottle, and can be refilled.  Again, all that said, all bottles offered here are empty and contain no alcohol.

Help Us Keep the Party Going!
We now have one of the best rock n roll related products hitting the market, but we've spent most of our money to get here.  That's why we really need you to become a Rock N Roll Founding Member and help us get our company off the ground. Get on the tour with us!  It's our dream to some day be a huge brand, and now by pledging you can play a big part in turning our dreams into that reality.
___________________________________________________________________
Who Are We?
We are a small start-up brand and for about a year we have been selling (fairly small-time) our Rock N Roll products in our distinctive guitar bottles.  We are trying to establish ourselves as a huge tequila brand recognized all over, and be a real player in our market.  We think we must be onto something too because we now have the blessings and license from Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE) to create our Elvis bottles, boxes and tequila adorned with the King Of Rock N Roll Elvis Presley image and name.
Who is Andy?
Way back when, our company's co-owner Andy Herbst used to help out in the promotion of concerts (even legends like Jimi Hendrix, The Doors and the Eagles) and ever since Andy has been involved in some way with rock bands, concerts or recording music.  Whether he was pushing the broom, tearing tickets at the door or organizing the whole damn event, he was totally loving it.  Even though he can't sing a note, Andy actually has a great ear for rock music.  We could go on and on about how much we like him, or how nice and humble and generous he is, and all the amazing things he's done in his life, or all the people he knows.  But trust us...  Andy is the perfect person to make this company successful.  Anyone that knows him will agree.
Who is Keith?
Keith Impink is the starving artist guy behind the look and feel of everything we do.  Keith designed our bottle, our boxes and all our logos and labels. He’s an artist, musician, songwriter type, but is probably best known for all the rock posters and art he has designed for rocker legends like Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Goo Goo Dolls, Jackson Brown, Bonnie Raitt and tons of others.  He probably made next to nothing from all that work, but he has been on the fringes of rock n roll promotion for decades which is good for us!  Keith also does our posters, ads, promotional materials, the Elvis art and he handles our web stuff too. He even created most of this page.  View his portfolio here at impink.com.
We don't have any employees, but we do have friends helping us out like Jose.  Jose is our master distiller and he has a factory in Mexico ready to make our  tequila, and he handles most of the customs and border stuff too.  So here's a shout-out thanks to Jose, Dennis, Mandy, Gordon, Jay C, Mark, Bret, Tom, Justin, Bob, Bob L., our friends, family, everyone who posed with our bottle, and all of you who helped us make our video... kudos!
___________________________________________________________________
What Are We Trying to Do?
So far, we've used our own money for the design and manufacturing of prototype bottles and packaging.  It's cost us just about everything to cover the development, licensing, designs, website and tons of legal stuff just to get to this point.  We did it though wholeheartedly because we really believe in our Rock N Roll products.  And we know we have a rock solid plan.  And you are a major part of our plan.  We're ready to rock, are you ready to roll?  See us on Elvis.com.
Our project is to have made a 40 foot truckload of Elvis Presley branded Rock N Roll decanters, and of course ship it here so we can box it, case it and make ready for sales.  We flat-out don't have the money to make this happen!  That's why we need your help.
Our project also includes having empty limited edition Founding Member bottles and collectors Elvis boxes made for you.  In fact, a huge part of this project is to reward you with creative collectibles and adventures you can't buy anywhere.

___________________________________________________________________
Why Elvis?
Simply put, Elvis is the ""King of Rock N Roll"" and is without a doubt the most recognizable Rock N Roll icon of all time... and we love Elvis.  Are you a huge fan like we are?... Then you'll appreciate the quality of everything about our Elvis bottle. We really feel that our product showcases Elvis and honors his legacy.  Rock N Roll Tequila is a tribute to ""The King"".  See us on Elvis.com.

We spent a lot of time building the relationships needed to make this happen, and have put in a lot of effort to get to this point.  The folks at Elvis (EPE) and Graceland are really happy with us and have given us a green light.  We think Elvis would be proud of what we have done and think he would want you to have your own collectible Founding Members guitar bottle available here by supporting our project.
___________________________________________________________________
Do We Have Fun?
You tell us.... If we’re not participating in a party or event, you may find us on one of our many Rock N Roll Bus Tours, where we charter a big bus, crank the music and travel with our fans to rock n roll concerts.  Is this fun?  We think so.  We get to listen to the best rock music all day long, hang out with musicians, artists, DJs, promoters and all sorts of cool people.
Rock N Roll Tequila is a product that brings fun to every party we go to, and we actually have fans!  One thing we like to do for fun is sneak backstage as much as possible to show off our bottle to the bands and musicians.  Rockstars always love the bottle, and they always want to pose with it.  That's how we got these pictures here.  thanks guys:)






Oh and here is a picture of Randy Maranz posing with our bottle.  He is the radio DJ from 104 The Hawk in Modesto CA.  Randy really likes what we are doing and made us an audio recording type commercial... so give it a listen.  thanks Randy:)
Listen (MP3) to Randy Maranz talk on the air about our product.
___________________________________________________________________
We Don't Just Look Good, Our Flavors are Awesome!
All of our Tequilas are made with 100% pure agave and are available in Blanco, Mango and Coffee flavors.  With your help, we plan to dominate the mid-priced tequila market with Rock N Roll Tequila.  We're not kidding, people really like what we are doing here.  We have great taste, the coolest bottle ever made, and Elvis.
___________________________________________________________________
How Will The Money Be Spent?
We've done a lot... the designs, the patents, certification of flavors, label approvals, trademarks... and we now have the Guitar Bottle and molds... it's almost done!
•  There are pledge costs and fees associated with servicing this campaign such as the PERKS, shirts, bottles, boxes, printing, travel tickets, shipping etc. •  We need money primarily to get a 40 foot truckload of Rock N Roll Elvis decanter bottles and Elvis boxes printed, packed and ready for shipping. •  We also need your help to pay for essential marketing, promotion and advertising. •  There are also fees for Indiegogo and campaign related costs.
___________________________________________________________________
Why Are We So Great?
•  We Have Music Fans.  We have a brand name closely associated with rock n roll music and it's built-in base of rock n roll fans.  Isn't this billions of people?•  We Have Approvals.  We have utility and design patents pending on our guitar shaped bottle features in many countries.  We have labels approved by TTB and CRT for all of our flavors and in all the sizes.  We have trademarks and all that stuff too. •  We Have Elvis Presley.  We have a sweet licensing deal with Elvis Presley Enterprises and therefore a built-in Elvis fan base. See us on Elvis.com.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Huntress, and we're about to embark on the biggest tour opportunity of our lives thus far; the Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival! But the kicker: it's also the most expensive and demanding tour opportunity of our lives too. When we found out our van couldn't take the heat and run our AC this summer, we realized we could be screwed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $15,000 and will be sharing a bus this summer on the Mayhem Festival with brothers of metal and fellow indiegogo campaigners Battlecross! We aren't bringing a merch person or sound guy. No crew. No help. Our 5 bunks alone on this bus cost $18,500, and that is just the beginning. The required insurance alone costs over $3,000. Tour insurance, what the hell is that?? And trust us; Blake the accountant did his research and our share of the bus IS cheaper than a Sprinter or pimped-out van with a generator. Huntress is new to this world of mosterous tours, but we plan to live through this one and conquer many more.</p>
<p>We're offering up some of our beloved oddity's and will be adding new perks weekly, so check back often!</p>

<h3>What is Portraits In The Key Of Punk Rock all about?</h3>
<p>I was trying to think of a witty quote to start this all out with, but I have nothing. Sorry.</p>
<p><span>Portraits In The Key Of Punk Rock will be a high quality photo book documenting the on and off stage lives of  current Punk Rock musicians and early Punk Rock progenitors. The goal for the book is to capture more than just the on stage persona but the people and lives behind the music. I want to make a visual record of the current state of Punk Rock including a look back at where it came from. </span></p>
<p><span>All photos will be taken by me, Patrick McLeod and unless you know me personally I'm pretty sure you have no idea who I am, but that's ok I'm a great guy. Go ahead ask me, I'll tell you I'm a great guy. In all seriousness though I am dedicated 100% to the success of this project fully funded or not. I am a photographer, good thing since this is a photography project, from London Ontario Canada, living in Phoenix Arizona for the last eleven years. I have a love of animals, two cats and two dogs to show for it, I love peoples stories and I love music among many other things. </span></p>
<p><span>The book will be sold at a price still to be determined, taking into account sponsorships, if any, final expenses and final publication costs. The goal is to keep quality high and price low.</span></p>
<p> <img alt=""Jello Biafra"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://portraitsinthekeyofpunkrock.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/04-JelloBiafra-13.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Jello Biafra""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I need help with and what you will get.</h3>
<p><strong>Where the money goes.</strong></p>
<p>I know you saw that number, it's a really big number, just let me tell you I felt the same way when I got an early quote on how much a book like this will cost to publish.</p>
<p>So there's that, publication of the book, unless I can find someone to sponsor that.</p>
<p>Equipment, yes I am a photographer and I have a camera, but I am a photographer without much money. So right now I have what gets me by. For this project I need a bit more, just to do this project justice. DSLR with a full frame sensor, critical for low light shots, as well as a couple of fast lenses for the same reason. A new laptop, this 2010 Dell just ain't cutting it anymore with all the photo processing. I'll sell this one and put the money towards the book when I get a new laptop.</p>
<p>Travel and expenses, I can't do this all at home. I plan to get to the west coast and east coast and everywhere in between. Canada and the UK. and who knows where else.</p>
<p>I will not compromise on quality, so this means more money, better book and if enough money volume two as well.</p>
<p><strong>Perks, oh yes the perks.</strong></p>
<p>Thank yous, both on the website and Facebook and in the book. Post cards, really nice ones with great pictures of Punk Rock musicians on them. Prints of  musicians, various sizes. T-shirts. Copies of the book, some signed. A picture of me wearing a really cool hat. Limited edition print of the cover photo signed by me and the musician/band on the cover. I travel to you, take your picture and put it in the book.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I don't get all the money?</strong></p>
<p>The book still happens, no compromises it will just take longer. To what degree things happen depends on the level of non-funding.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There will be impact all around on this one. I want to chronicle what is going on right now in the Punk Rock scene. I want to bring attention to bands that struggle everyday to do what they love, but also highlight bands that have succeeded against all odds. I want to give fans of the music something that brings them closer to the musicians that they look up to and have brought them so much enjoyment from their music. </p>
<p>This will also bring me the experience of meeting countless people and hopefully making some lasting friendships along the way.</p>
<p>I need to mention that I will not be making any money from the sale of this book, I am donating all the money to charity. You can find out more about that on Portraits In The Key Of Punk Rock website and on Facebook.</p>

</div></div>","What is Portraits In The Key Of Punk Rock all about?
I was trying to think of a witty quote to start this all out with, but I have nothing. Sorry.
Portraits In The Key Of Punk Rock will be a high quality photo book documenting the on and off stage lives of  current Punk Rock musicians and early Punk Rock progenitors. The goal for the book is to capture more than just the on stage persona but the people and lives behind the music. I want to make a visual record of the current state of Punk Rock including a look back at where it came from. 
All photos will be taken by me, Patrick McLeod and unless you know me personally I'm pretty sure you have no idea who I am, but that's ok I'm a great guy. Go ahead ask me, I'll tell you I'm a great guy. In all seriousness though I am dedicated 100% to the success of this project fully funded or not. I am a photographer, good thing since this is a photography project, from London Ontario Canada, living in Phoenix Arizona for the last eleven years. I have a love of animals, two cats and two dogs to show for it, I love peoples stories and I love music among many other things. 
The book will be sold at a price still to be determined, taking into account sponsorships, if any, final expenses and final publication costs. The goal is to keep quality high and price low.
 


What I need help with and what you will get.
Where the money goes.
I know you saw that number, it's a really big number, just let me tell you I felt the same way when I got an early quote on how much a book like this will cost to publish.
So there's that, publication of the book, unless I can find someone to sponsor that.
Equipment, yes I am a photographer and I have a camera, but I am a photographer without much money. So right now I have what gets me by. For this project I need a bit more, just to do this project justice. DSLR with a full frame sensor, critical for low light shots, as well as a couple of fast lenses for the same reason. A new laptop, this 2010 Dell just ain't cutting it anymore with all the photo processing. I'll sell this one and put the money towards the book when I get a new laptop.
Travel and expenses, I can't do this all at home. I plan to get to the west coast and east coast and everywhere in between. Canada and the UK. and who knows where else.
I will not compromise on quality, so this means more money, better book and if enough money volume two as well.
Perks, oh yes the perks.
Thank yous, both on the website and Facebook and in the book. Post cards, really nice ones with great pictures of Punk Rock musicians on them. Prints of  musicians, various sizes. T-shirts. Copies of the book, some signed. A picture of me wearing a really cool hat. Limited edition print of the cover photo signed by me and the musician/band on the cover. I travel to you, take your picture and put it in the book.
What happens if I don't get all the money?
The book still happens, no compromises it will just take longer. To what degree things happen depends on the level of non-funding.


The Impact
There will be impact all around on this one. I want to chronicle what is going on right now in the Punk Rock scene. I want to bring attention to bands that struggle everyday to do what they love, but also highlight bands that have succeeded against all odds. I want to give fans of the music something that brings them closer to the musicians that they look up to and have brought them so much enjoyment from their music. 
This will also bring me the experience of meeting countless people and hopefully making some lasting friendships along the way.
I need to mention that I will not be making any money from the sale of this book, I am donating all the money to charity. You can find out more about that on Portraits In The Key Of Punk Rock website and on Facebook.

<p>But back to who we are.....</p>
<p>We're just a few Thirty Something Fathers/Husbands who’ve been writing and performing music since 1990. We’ve played in garage’s, basements, pubs, pit parties, slummy bars, and even a couple of music festivals.<br/></p>
<p>From 1994 to 1998 a couple members of <strong>Maude’s Wagon</strong>
were heavily vested in a band called <em>Stript Stone</em> seen in the video link here:  (<em> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J1ngdGzZSc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J1ngdGzZSc</a> </em>) - which at the time, at least in our own heads,
we were rock stars.</p>
<p>Stript Stone was featured on local television networks,
they won a recording contract with a local studio in the
1997 Battle of the Bands, were invited to play at several music
festivals, performed multiple shows for 1000’s….but alas, the band came to a
grinding halt in October of 1998.</p>
<p>Since then, Travis, Jeremy and Ben (Long time friend and exceptional drummer) have been writing and perfecting songs which are now ready to be recorded professionally.</p>
<p>We have a sample of a previously recorded song, Friend No More which has been <b>TRENDING FOR SIX WEEKS STRAIGHT ON</b> <a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/maudeswagon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Reverb Nation</a> Which will become our first single.<br/></p>
<p>Recently on Sunday Sept-22-2013, Maudes Wagon got together to re-record a better version of the song plus a couple additional tracks as per request from our fans and will be available soon!<br/></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We will be using the money towards professional recording
studio time and part of it will be used for manufacturing actual LP's. We are not recording engineers and want to produce a quality product - therefor the professional studio time is required.<br/></p>
<p>After so many years
of loving and creating music, it’s time to get it out of our heads and into the
digital world.</p>
<p>What you'll receive for funding this project is a digital
download of the album and given at random, other promotional material, and of course an honorable mention on our website

<h3>So, it's time to make an album</h3>
<p>After six years of writing, performing, and fine tuning a catalogue of songs, I’m ready to head into the studio and create a full length album that I can proudly share with the world. I have full band arrangements of ten original songs, from folk to funky rock to soul to straight-ahead jazz, just waiting to be recorded and reach your beautiful ears.</p>
<p>I really believe that these songs speak to truth, beauty, goodness, goofiness, fun, sorrow, and just being human. With your support, this album can finally be made and sent out into the musical chasm of the world.</p>
<p>To me, music is a gift that isn’t supposed to be held on to. If it isn’t shared with others, it’s just like the forgotten apples in the bottom drawer of your refrigerator - rotting away, turning brown and mushy, not giving their sweetness to anyone at all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>And here's the plan</h3>
<p>For the past ten years, I’ve been sharing my music in one way or another with those around me - with friends, at church, for family, at events where organizers are looking for music to set the mood or enhance the experience. With my view of sharing music as a gift, I have not amassed any sort of “musical savings” to fund the creation of an album, which is exactly where you can come it right now.</p>
<p>If you help me reach my fundraising goal, I will head into Sacred Heart Recording Studio, the premier recording studio in Duluth, MN, this summer to work with some amazing people and bring this album to life. Many great Minnesota bands have recorded at Sacred Heart in the past, including Trampled by Turtles, Low, Charlie Parr, Gaelynn Lea, and many more. If I don't make my fundraising goal, I will work with a smaller recording studio in Duluth to complete this album.</p>
<p>I have many reward options that you can choose when you sign up to support this project, including music, merchandise, live shows, and some quirky, personalized oddities. The money you pledge will be used for time in the recording studio, mixing, mastering, paying musicians, CD production, and reward fulfillment.</p>
<p>This project can’t happen without you, so I humbly and tremblingly ask for your magnanimous support to create some beautiful music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's always an element of risk in supporting a creative project like an album, because you (as the listener) never know what the final product will be until you hear it. But hopefully, that's part of the excitement and the joy in being a supporter.</p>
<p>In addition to the years writing and performing these songs, I've also been spending a lot of time in the last two months specifically planning this campaign and this album. I will absolutely do everything in my power to make sure that at the end of this, you have an album in the hand that you and I can both be proud of.</p>
<p>I've learned a lot in the recording I've done on my own, and with some guidance from professional technicians and the support of a great cast of musicians, I am confident this will be great.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether you can contribute financially to this project or not, you can still help by spreading the word! Tell your mom, remind your cat, and soliloquize to your next-door neighbor about this album and this campaign. Share this page with all your friends on the interwebs and whatever social medias you use.

<h3>The CD: New Year</h3>
<p>My name is Anne Sajdera. I’m a San Francisco-based pianist/composer who has been part of the Bay Area music scene for almost 30 years. After graduating from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, I went on to form my own jazz ensemble, performing jazz and Brazilian music throughout the Bay Area. I have also performed with other Bay Area notables such as Alexa Weber Morales, Terrence Brewer, Sandy Cressman and Erik Jekabson’s the Electric Squeezebox Orchestra. My first CD, <i>Azul </i>(Bijuri Records, 2012), featured stellar Bay Area musicians such as Gary Brown, Paul van Wageningen, Phil Thompson and Mike Spiro as well as the percussion legend Airto Moreira.</p>
<p>Inspired by Herbie Hancock’s vision for International Jazz Day (International Jazz Day is an International Day declared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 2011 ""to highlight jazz and its diplomatic role of uniting people in all corners of the globe."") I invited two award-winning horn players from Prague: Miroslav Hloucal (trumpet) &amp; Jan Fečo (alto sax), to perform on my newest recording, and to contribute compositions and arrangements, we are truly looking forward to seeing our work finally be released to the public. They will be bringing their amazing energy to our CD release performances.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will help defray their visa costs and airfare, making this effort toward uniting people from different parts of the world into a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Specifics</h3>
<p><strong>For this campaign I’m hoping to collect $2,500</strong></p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of the travel costs:</p>
<p>I-129 petition fee for Hloucal/FečoDuo, $460</p>
<p>Labor Consult fee from American Federation of Musicians, $250</p>
<p>Visa cost, $392</p>
<p>Airfare, $2,000</p>
<p>Total $3,102 </p>
<p>As you can see the actual travel costs are a little bit more than what I’m requesting.</p>
<p>Here are the choices of different contributions and gifts:</p>
<p><strong>$20</strong> digital copy of New Year</p>
<p><strong>$25</strong> New Year: signed CD</p>
<p><strong>$50 </strong>signed CD and two dozen delicious little cookies, baked from a recipe out of Deborah Madison’s cookbook, carefully packaged and mailed to you – your choice of nut, spice nut, almond, tollhouse (chocolate chip) </p>
<p><strong>$50</strong> signed CD and two dozen chocolate cookies with Reese’s peanut butter chips </p>

</div></div>","The CD: New Year
My name is Anne Sajdera. I’m a San Francisco-based pianist/composer who has been part of the Bay Area music scene for almost 30 years. After graduating from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, I went on to form my own jazz ensemble, performing jazz and Brazilian music throughout the Bay Area. I have also performed with other Bay Area notables such as Alexa Weber Morales, Terrence Brewer, Sandy Cressman and Erik Jekabson’s the Electric Squeezebox Orchestra. My first CD, Azul (Bijuri Records, 2012), featured stellar Bay Area musicians such as Gary Brown, Paul van Wageningen, Phil Thompson and Mike Spiro as well as the percussion legend Airto Moreira.
Inspired by Herbie Hancock’s vision for International Jazz Day (International Jazz Day is an International Day declared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 2011 ""to highlight jazz and its diplomatic role of uniting people in all corners of the globe."") I invited two award-winning horn players from Prague: Miroslav Hloucal (trumpet) & Jan Fečo (alto sax), to perform on my newest recording, and to contribute compositions and arrangements, we are truly looking forward to seeing our work finally be released to the public. They will be bringing their amazing energy to our CD release performances.
By contributing to this campaign you will help defray their visa costs and airfare, making this effort toward uniting people from different parts of the world into a reality.

The Specifics
For this campaign I’m hoping to collect $2,500
Here is the breakdown of the travel costs:
I-129 petition fee for Hloucal/FečoDuo, $460
Labor Consult fee from American Federation of Musicians, $250
Visa cost, $392
Airfare, $2,000
Total $3,102 
As you can see the actual travel costs are a little bit more than what I’m requesting.
Here are the choices of different contributions and gifts:
$20 digital copy of New Year
$25 New Year: signed CD
$50 signed CD and two dozen delicious little cookies, baked from a recipe out of Deborah Madison’s cookbook, carefully packaged and mailed to you – your choice of nut, spice nut, almond, tollhouse (chocolate chip) 
$50 signed CD and two dozen chocolate cookies with Reese’s peanut butter chips 
$100 signed CD and charts for all of the compositions on New Year, printed on quality paper and gathered together in an attractive folder. 
$500 signed CD, web-listing on the album credits under ‘executive producer’s circle’ and a private concert in your home by Anne.
If we don't achieve our $2,500 goal, the funds would still go toward those travel costs. Any amount helps.

<h3>anrimeal</h3>
<p>Hey! I am Ana, and I've been developing the anrimeal project in semi-secret for 3 years now. At the heart of my music is a true passion for creative freedom and experimentation with sound. Borrowing from folk tradition and hip-hop boldness, my music combines the worlds of vocal and sound design storytelling.</p>
<p>Since 2016 I have been enthusiastically learning all I can to develop my art and express myself, and the time finally has come for me to share that process with the world. My very own label Demo Records is partnering with Crossness Records (helmed by the ever so generous Hannah Ehrlich) to create a product worth presenting to the independent music lovers out there!</p>
<p>With that said, I kindly ask for your help to make this happen, opening up a pre-pre-order space to help fund the beginning of this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Money</h3>
<p>The total budget will be roughly divided between the cost of pressing a limited number of coloured vinyl and paying for people's time in spreading the word about this record. </p>
<p>The album will still get made if the goal of our target isn't reached, but your contributions will undoubtedly take this project to a different level of future sustainability.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>The perks section works essentially like a pre-pre-order, divided into 4 different tiers.</p>
<ul>
<li>For £8, you get a thank you note from me + a download code which will give you access to unlimited streaming via the Bandcamp website &amp; app (Limited to 100)</li>
<li>For £20, you get a signed copy of the limited edition coloured vinyl + thank you note + a download code which will give you access to unlimited streaming via the Bandcamp website &amp; app (Limited to 100)</li>
<li>For £35, you get all of the above + 1 cassette infinite tape loop of a part of the record + access to a private Discord group where we discuss the inside of campaign decisions, share behind the scenes information &amp; otherwise permanent AMA (Limited to 20)</li>
<li>For £100, all of the above + a live performance in your living room/local pub or venue - not inclusive of travel costs (Limited to 5)</li>
</ul>

I'm very excited to have the opportunity to make the record I've always wanted to make, and I'm grateful to have your support during this process. I moved to Nashville with the goal of crafting great songs. It's a constant learning process, but I feel I'm gaining ground and establishing myself as a songwriter. I'm happy to be working with Jim Reilley, who has a wealth of knowledge as a producer, musician, artist and songwriter. We listened to several (about 30) songs that I've written and were contenders for this project. We demoed three of the songs, initially, to see how they came together in the studio and to see how we worked together, along with sound engineer, Eric Fritsch. It has been a great experience with great momentum! The potential here is truly inspiring. With a strong start as our launching pad and strong sense of our creative direction for this project, I feel confident that we are about to make something really special.

<p>Perfume is a Japanese pop group, originally from Hiroshima, Japan. The 3 girls have dazzled Japan and the world, and are returning to America as an extension of their most recent album tour, Cosmic Explorer. </p>
<p>As fans, traditionally we have organized to sing an ""encore"" song at the end of the concert, as a means of goodwill and support to the girls. It's become a semi-tradition at concerts internationally, and for Perfume's first visit to Chicago, we'd like to make it a memorable one.</p>
<p>With the international community and the nature of music in a foreign language, these flyers allow fans to have a 'cheat sheet' to sing along in unity so we can leave a lasting impression of love for every city the girls visit. These flyers also serve as memorabilia for fans who visit each city and concert. </p>

<b>$200 - Printing.</b> The price of printing 2,000 copies of flyers for the event. This is as cheap as we could find this short of notice. These flyers are meant to be distributed and shared to a concert of 3,000 people. </li>
<li>
<b>$150 - Artist fees.</b> We need to pay an artist for their time and rushing this art for our flyers so that we have something beautiful and memorable to look at.</li> <li>
<b>$150 - Design.</b> To design the flyers and edit to ensure the lyrics are correct, we will need to pay someone to edit the images and lyrics to appear both clearly and in an easy to read format, without distracting from the art.</li>
</ul>
<div><b>The music selected for this event was ""Perfume"" by Perfume, due to it's ease of singing and chanting in both English and Japanese. We feel short notice it will be easy for fans to gather and sing loud together, even in Japanese.</b></div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We realize this is very short notice. This is a huge set back to designing and printing these flyers. Without support and the banding together of fans, we cannot make this a reality. <br/><br/>If we do not meet our goal, we will attempt to print as many lyric sheets as possible and cover whatever we can as we can. Since this is a fan practice, by fans and for fans, we urge you to take part in Perfume history and help us welcome them warmly to Chicago. Everyone is running short on time, but we are full of love, so the only thing between us now is the finances to produce the items.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot donate, consider sharing us within your Perfume fan communities. The more word out about this, the quicker we can reach our goal and get the flyers made and distributed at the event.<br/><br/>Please share and help us make Chicago a city of memories for the girls of PERFUME!</p>

$150 - Artist fees. We need to pay an artist for their time and rushing this art for our flyers so that we have something beautiful and memorable to look at. 
$150 - Design. To design the flyers and edit to ensure the lyrics are correct, we will need to pay someone to edit the images and lyrics to appear both clearly and in an easy to read format, without distracting from the art.

The music selected for this event was ""Perfume"" by Perfume, due to it's ease of singing and chanting in both English and Japanese. We feel short notice it will be easy for fans to gather and sing loud together, even in Japanese.

    Risks & Challenges We realize this is very short notice. This is a huge set back to designing and printing these flyers. Without support and the banding together of fans, we cannot make this a reality. If we do not meet our goal, we will attempt to print as many lyric sheets as possible and cover whatever we can as we can. Since this is a fan practice, by fans and for fans, we urge you to take part in Perfume history and help us welcome them warmly to Chicago. Everyone is running short on time, but we are full of love, so the only thing between us now is the finances to produce the items.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot donate, consider sharing us within your Perfume fan communities. The more word out about this, the quicker we can reach our goal and get the flyers made and distributed at the event.Please share and help us make Chicago a city of memories for the girls of PERFUME!

About Grant Street Grifters
Formed in 2008, the acoustic duo specializes in Folk, Old-Time, and Blues and is based in southwest Pennsylvania's Steel City. Since their inception, Peter Flynn (guitar/vocals) and Trish Imbrogno (double bass/vocals) have been a fixture in the Pittsburgh music scene, as well as sharing their talents up and down the I-79 corridor. The combination of their polar opposite playing styles lends a unique sound to traditional American Folk music. 

The duo met as students at Duquesne University. Trish was on her way to a Bachelor's Degree in double bass performance and Pete was on his way to, well ... nothing in particular. Trish headed west, Pete stayed in Pittsburgh, and they wouldn’t see each other very much over the next ten years. But, thanks to the magic of online social networking, they were able to reconnect, and eventually musical duo was born. 

Grant Street Grifters began their career as ""The Grifters"" at L.L. Bean, after Trish received a call from their headquarters in Freeport, Maine. They were about to finish construction of their newest store at Ross Park Mall and were looking to have live acoustic music for the grand opening. As Trish recalls, she may have been a little loose with the facts when she accepted the gig: 

“The call was completely unexpected. When the woman on the phone explained who she was and what she wanted, I was like ‘Sure, I’m in a band that fits what you’re looking for.’ Then I called Pete and told him we need to put a band together and learn a bunch of songs ASAP! We started practicing and a few weeks later I received an email asking for the name of our band, which of course we hadn’t thought of yet. Pete chose ‘The Grifters’, since we had kind of conned our way into the gig.” 


Growing up in a musical family, Pete had been playing the guitar since age eight and started to show an interest in traditional American music in his early high school years. During those years, when most of his musician friends were worshiping Hendrix and Jimmy Page, Pete had a different set of guitar heroes – the acoustic guitar wizards who were discovered and rediscovered in the great folk music boom of the early sixties. He dusted off his dad’s old records and immersed himself in the music of Dave Van Ronk, Mississippi John Hurt, Rev. Gary Davis and Doc Watson. 

Trish grew up listening to hard rock and heavy metal, even playing in an early 90s ""hair band."" She saw the light in her teens and became interested in the sounds of the Grateful Dead, Phish, The Allman Brothers and other more roots-oriented bands, all the while studying Beethoven, Bach and Mozart. She didn't try her hand at playing the music to which she listened until 2007 when she co-founded The Polished Pearls, a duo with singer/songwriter and music therapist Andrea Scheve that eventually grew into a acoustic quintet. 

One of the players to round out the band was Pete on lead guitar. The Pearls played a series of shows over the next year with Trish gaining the confidence to actually play something off the page and Pete regaining his chops.

But just when it all came together, it all fell apart. Andrea was forced to relocate to California and the band was no more. Enter a phone call from Maine, and the rest is what lies before you. 

What does it sound like when a metal head turned Deadhead classical bassist and acoustic roots guitarist get together? You'll have to hear for yourself...

<h3>More Music:  Stretch goal of $3500 = 4 More CDs added to Perks... So, 6 in total on the way :-)<br/>
</h3>
Immense thanks to everyone who has helped us reach the first goal.  We are now able to build a fantastic studio computer to replace the 10 year old Windows XP box.  Yeah!<br/><br/>Our new target helps purchase a few more microphones, suited to recording live percussive instruments (bohdran, djembe, cajon), and gives the studio the option of tracking more than one acoustic guitar/mandolin/violin at the same time in the studio or on stage.  You rock!!<br/><br/><i><b>And if we reach this goal, then you can get extra perks!</b></i>  <br/>Everyone that has pledged $25 or more is already getting two new CDs of music being created this summer... the mix of original, cover, and parody/Filk songs.  30 songs minimum!<br/><br/><b><i>In fact, I've already started writing... <br/></i></b>Here's a scratch track of the first perk song request... ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1xiihzE2J4&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Watching It On Netflix"",</a> recorded at 4:30am Thursday morning.  Can't wait to redo it with the new system!<br/><br/><h4><b>And if we reach $3500, there will be 4 more CDs worth of music added to the contribution level of $25 or more:</b></h4>
<b><br/>Kari Maaren's current CD </b><a href=""https://karimaaren.bandcamp.com/track/everybody-hates-elves"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Everybody Hates Elves""</a> via download!  Keep or share, it's your code to use as you see fit. Rumour has it that Kari has another project in the planning stages... so it's a good idea to get to know her now :-)<br/><br/><b>The Faithful Sidekicks brand new CD</b> <a href=""http://thefaithfulsidekicks.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""*.* and Other Star Things""</a> via download!<br/>Go check it out at the link (only if you like geeky things with the word ""Star"" in them.  Or if you like coffee.  Or Dr. Who. or....)<br/><br/>Plus 2 more full length projects: <b>""Background Music for Any Planet Vol 1 &amp; 2""</b>.  <br/><br/>I don't know if it's possible to conjure the Geek using just instrumentals, but I'm going to try.  I want to create music that is good to support small gatherings... board games, crafting, RPG, etc.  One project will be softer, ambient stuff... the second will have more pace and energy.<br/><b>Due Date: mid 2017</b><i> (sorry about the wait.. but we have so 
much cool stuff going on in the first year, that I don't want to under 
deliver on this one)</i><br/><br/><i><b>But there's still a challenge to solve: what songs should we do?</b></i><br/><br/>The top tier perks levels for the campaign are getting full (thank you!), and the focus now shifts to finding people that have ideas for cover songs, parodies, and originals.  We've had a few ideas already, and they are <b>FANTASTIC</b>.  Let's get some more!  <br/><br/>Who do we know that would love a custom song created?  Who has a dream of hearing their song idea come to life?  The links below show that we can create good sounding stuff together... let's find the people that share this passion of ours!<br/><i></i><br/><br/><br/><h3>Original Campaign notes below...<br/>
</h3>Alter Ego Music has helped over 60 music artists (on-line and in person) over the past decade.  In the past year alone, 25 ""Geek"" and ""Filk"" artists have had work go through the studio, and just as many more used some of the gear for conventions and stage performances!<br/>
<p>The heart of the recording studio is the computer... and although it is still going strong (sometimes), the original Windows XP machine is finally going off line.  And I would like your help to build a massively good replacement.</p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>In exchange for your help, there are 3 tiers of perks lined up for you to consider:</h4>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Entry Level: You get copies of some or all of the music created this year.  Thank you very much... sharing our music is the reason we make it in the first place!<br/>
</li>
<br/><li>Mid Level: You get all the music created, plus you get to tell us 
what songs you want to hear... over 30 in total, please.  I want to 
deliver a mix of original songs, covers, parodies, and Filk songs.  Hopefully more if you ask for it!<br/>
</li>
<br/><li>Top Level: You get time to work on your songs in the studio... on-line or in person.  
Plus you get copies of all songs created as part of this campaign.</li>
</ol>
<br/>For anyone interested in the technical details for the new computer, I have put those at the end of the campaign page.  But before we get to the plans for <i>The New Hotness</i>, here is a quick peek at <i>Old &amp; Busted:</i><br/><p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<h3>The last (musical) word? Don't forget the Filk at FKO this year!</h3>
<p>I am delighted to be invited back to Filk Ontario this year to help with sound at the live stage.  Last year was a blast... and this year, I'm bringing more toys to help record the performances.  That's right: Alter Ego Music is joining forces with USB Studios to capture the show, and we hope to reveal plans to mix and master the songs performed at FKO 26, April 8th - 10th.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we will close out the music samples with some more folks that proudly call themselves ""Filkers"":<br/></p>

</div></div>","More Music:  Stretch goal of $3500 = 4 More CDs added to Perks... So, 6 in total on the way :-)

Immense thanks to everyone who has helped us reach the first goal.  We are now able to build a fantastic studio computer to replace the 10 year old Windows XP box.  Yeah!Our new target helps purchase a few more microphones, suited to recording live percussive instruments (bohdran, djembe, cajon), and gives the studio the option of tracking more than one acoustic guitar/mandolin/violin at the same time in the studio or on stage.  You rock!!And if we reach this goal, then you can get extra perks!  Everyone that has pledged $25 or more is already getting two new CDs of music being created this summer... the mix of original, cover, and parody/Filk songs.  30 songs minimum!In fact, I've already started writing... Here's a scratch track of the first perk song request... ""Watching It On Netflix"", recorded at 4:30am Thursday morning.  Can't wait to redo it with the new system!And if we reach $3500, there will be 4 more CDs worth of music added to the contribution level of $25 or more:
Kari Maaren's current CD ""Everybody Hates Elves"" via download!  Keep or share, it's your code to use as you see fit. Rumour has it that Kari has another project in the planning stages... so it's a good idea to get to know her now :-)The Faithful Sidekicks brand new CD ""*.* and Other Star Things"" via download!Go check it out at the link (only if you like geeky things with the word ""Star"" in them.  Or if you like coffee.  Or Dr. Who. or....)Plus 2 more full length projects: ""Background Music for Any Planet Vol 1 & 2"".  I don't know if it's possible to conjure the Geek using just instrumentals, but I'm going to try.  I want to create music that is good to support small gatherings... board games, crafting, RPG, etc.  One project will be softer, ambient stuff... the second will have more pace and energy.Due Date: mid 2017 (sorry about the wait.. but we have so 
much cool stuff going on in the first year, that I don't want to under 
deliver on this one)But there's still a challenge to solve: what songs should we do?The top tier perks levels for the campaign are getting full (thank you!), and the focus now shifts to finding people that have ideas for cover songs, parodies, and originals.  We've had a few ideas already, and they are FANTASTIC.  Let's get some more!  Who do we know that would love a custom song created?  Who has a dream of hearing their song idea come to life?  The links below show that we can create good sounding stuff together... let's find the people that share this passion of ours!Original Campaign notes below...
Alter Ego Music has helped over 60 music artists (on-line and in person) over the past decade.  In the past year alone, 25 ""Geek"" and ""Filk"" artists have had work go through the studio, and just as many more used some of the gear for conventions and stage performances!
The heart of the recording studio is the computer... and although it is still going strong (sometimes), the original Windows XP machine is finally going off line.  And I would like your help to build a massively good replacement.

In exchange for your help, there are 3 tiers of perks lined up for you to consider:


Entry Level: You get copies of some or all of the music created this year.  Thank you very much... sharing our music is the reason we make it in the first place!

Mid Level: You get all the music created, plus you get to tell us 
what songs you want to hear... over 30 in total, please.  I want to 
deliver a mix of original songs, covers, parodies, and Filk songs.  Hopefully more if you ask for it!

Top Level: You get time to work on your songs in the studio... on-line or in person.  
Plus you get copies of all songs created as part of this campaign.

For anyone interested in the technical details for the new computer, I have put those at the end of the campaign page.  But before we get to the plans for The New Hotness, here is a quick peek at Old & Busted:


Ah... the dreams I had back in 2006...probably still good for StarCraft 1.



Studio Samples & Contributing Artists:

To celebrate the 10 year milestone (and launch the next era in fine style), over a dozen artists are joining me in the studio this year, to provide some custom music in exchange for your help with this campaign.  
Here are some samples that were recorded in the studio over the past 5 years.  Please click through the song titles to access some great music...


Bill Craig, doing his cover of Stan Rogers  ""Witch of the Westmoreland""

Kari Maaren, with her original song ""Everybody Hates Elves""

Devin Melanson & Jessica Nelson feat Adam Hill on vocals  ""Yes Or No""


Devin Melanson feat Leslie Hudson on vocal ""Threat Detected"" podcast

Devin Melanson & Leslie Hudson as Copy Red Leader  ""Tatooine Blues""







Join the Dark Side... we have headphones (clockwise from top left: Heather, Chris, Tracie, & Samantha)



Other Artists working with us on this project:


Peter Watkinson lives in Amsterdam, and he sends us some lovely metal via his music project Abomnium

We have Rock and Pop on tap from our great friend John at Das Binky

Toronto's original and longest lasting geek duo of awesome consists of Alex & Sean from Nerds with Guitars.  Check out their song ""Sympathy for the Daleks""

The stellar duo Debs & Errol are also helping.  Check out their stuff here



Eric and Jen bring us brand new geek music as The Faithful Sidekicks




Peter at Rock Paper Cynic has a new album coming out... and for now, you can check out his other stuff over here


The last (musical) word? Don't forget the Filk at FKO this year!
I am delighted to be invited back to Filk Ontario this year to help with sound at the live stage.  Last year was a blast... and this year, I'm bringing more toys to help record the performances.  That's right: Alter Ego Music is joining forces with USB Studios to capture the show, and we hope to reveal plans to mix and master the songs performed at FKO 26, April 8th - 10th.
In the meantime, we will close out the music samples with some more folks that proudly call themselves ""Filkers"":


Here are Morva and Alan with their song ""Mockingjay""



Phil Mills is also a Filker... check out his song ""The Once Upon A Time"", and then check out more of his catalog here.


Both of these songs appeared on a recent charity CD called ""Filkus Borealis"" that I was very glad to work on.  See?  Music can be used for good!



And now, more happy recording peoples... then some tech details & evil plans.

And now, some details.
Footnotes for the 5 pieces of sample music




Bill Craig performed this cover of ""The Witch of the Westmoreland"" in a single take, using two microphones and the direct out from his acoustic guitar.  He rocked it!  Bill toured with The Irish Rovers back in the day.  *respect*

Kari Maaren, also records voice and ukulele together, often in one take as well. I have the hardest time staying quiet when recording with Kari, as her first take is always great, but I have to stifle myself from laughing every time I hear one of her new songs.

Devin Melanson & Jessica Nelson feat Adam Hill on vocals  ""Yes Or No""  Jess wrote this lyric for FAWM in 2013, and I wrote the music and vocal melody.  Then I reached out to Adam, and he recorded his vocal in his home studio, which was sent to me for processing and mixing here.


Devin Melanson feat Leslie Hudson on vocal ""Threat Detected"" podcast.  Our good friend Garrett Crowe runs many fine geek things as your barefoottourguide at threat-detected.com  Go check out his games and podcasts!


Devin Melanson & Leslie Hudson as Copy Red Leader  ""Tatooine Blues"".  Working with Leslie on the Copy Red Leader project created many opportunities to refine the work process for both studio and live recording.  Make sure you (try to) keep up to her other prolific projects over here!

     software... may require code to integrate these two generations), PreSonus
     1818VSL (hardware & software), Toontrack (software), Other purchased
     VST plugs (software), Remote Control development (Android tablet/iPad
     control via PreSonus Virtual Software), integrate MOTU 828 MKii with
     PreSonus 1818 VSL (external clock, SPIDF & ADAT optical)

     technical details of how the system works (including any software/hardware
     patches created)
May thru November 2016:
     write, record, mix & master the 30+ songs to fulfill perks (plus any
     artist projects that are scheduled)
December 2016 (early): make
     all songs available


Project specific detail #2: The computer build.  First, some basic components that are required to build the new computer:

Power Supply: Corsair RM650M
CPU: Intel I7 4790K (4th
     Gen)
OS: Win7 Pro X64

Now, some
things that *should* work together (I'm pretty sure they will work together) in
special ways, due to the requirements of this build:

Case: Rosewill RSV-Z2600
     (rack mounted, for recording live stage events and other portable
     recording needs)
Mainboard: Asus H97M-Plus (supports
     the 2 additional UAD processor expansion boards that need to be
     integrated via PCI)
RAM: Crucial Ballistix
     Tactical LP 16GB (needs to fit in the case!)
CPU Fan: Noctua NH-L9x65
     (needs to be quiet in the studio)
System Hard Drive: Samsung
     EVO 850 M2 250GB (fast SSD for all the operating systems, effects plugins,
     and soft synths)
Audio File Data Drives: A
     pair of WD Black 3TB (programmed to immediately store all audio as it is
     recorded, with a mirrored copy on each drive for failsafe redundancy)
Case Fans: Enermax UCTB8
     (three of these, and they also must be quiet)
Internal USB ports: There
     are several licensing keys & dongles that enable software to
     run.  These will be mounted inside the case, to prevent damage when
     the computer is moved.
Some sort of portable
     display when booting the system.  Once everything is started, I will
     be able to control the studio via iPad (similar to the stage shows I've
     helped with).  This is really nice in live music situations.

Whew... that's the details of when, and what, things will happen.  Thank you for reading through until the end... your patience is appreciated!
I am really looking forward to getting the system up and running, and recording some new music.  And I hope that you can help out, and tell me what music you want to hear.  It would be great to work with you!
