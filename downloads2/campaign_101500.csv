It offers the comfort of being carried as a backpack, while being every bit as adaptable as you need it to be. It is designed for the moments when you need a messenger, or for those meetings when you prefer to walk in with a briefcase style carry.   We all carry different objects, and each day requires us to pack specific stuff. That is why we created a bag that can be customised to your exact needs. The velcro protective dividers, let you organise your interior, or can be completely removed for maximum capacity.    
           The Pack comes with 4 interior dividers that allow you to organise your essentials just the way you want to.By using the horizontal divider, the interior is essentially separated into two halves that can each be accessed separately. That way when you need to reach for an object in your bag, you can simply open the top or bottom half and have direct access.You can forget about having to dig through your entire bag looking for it.If you wish to turn your Pack into a full camera bag, there is the option of choosing the Add On dividers.   One of the favourite features of our previous Kickstarter backers is back! The instant access pocket means that you can grab your camera right away, even when carrying it as a backpack.
While the simplistic design of the Pack will mean that others won’t necessarily realise that it is a camera bag, we know that it is better to be on the safe side. That is why we developed a closing mechanism to decrease the ease with which the pocket can be opened. For complete peace of mind, the two zipper pulls can be secured together with a small padlock.        Our aim is and has always been to create high quality leather bags that pack unmatched versatility at affordable prices. We are confident that we are creating a quality to price ratio that is hard to match, but at the same time we are aware that our leather goods are not necessarily cheap.That is why we want you to invest in a T. Forevers bag knowing that you will get the most out of it on a daily basis. The simple, timeless design of the Pack, allows you to carry it regardless of whether you are taking it on a walk around the city, or need a professional looking bag for an event.   Some of us simply carry a lot of stuff, even on a daily basis. That’s why we studied duffel after duffel and realised that they are simply not designed to carry all our digital gear.

                              The Duffel can be attached in less than a minute to the Slim. Simply unzip the exterior cover and zip up the Slim. 
This is the go to city bag. It connects to both the Pack and the Duffel and it has all the essential features of a standalone bag that can carry your laptop, tablet, documents and any other chargers you may need throughout your day.

 

                                     Our commitment to traditional craftsmanship is sometimes visible on the exterior of our goods, other times, it is hidden within the bag itself. That is why we want to share with our backers the process involved from sketch, to prototyping, to crafting.Each handcrafted bag is unique in its own way to the one before it, each is imperfectly perfect. What you see and what you feel in your hands when you get your leather good is a representation of the growth and improvement of the craftsman’s set of skills throughout its career.In other words, your Temporary Forevers bag is the sum total of every product previously created by the craftsman.T. Forevers leather goods are handcrafted in Europe where we are proud to share workshop with some of the best known International brands. 
 

      We are founded upon a diverse background of knowledge and design experience, because we believe that only those not aware of their industry limits can break through the known and add a new perspective to a leather making craft bound by established tradition.With a team of born travellers, our designs are inspired by the things we see and experience on our adventures. Therefore functionality and a simplistic design are key factors that drive the handcrafting process of every leather good that we create.   As a backer of our project, you become part of our team and therefore we believe it is our responsibility to be transparent with you throughout the production process.We want you to see and be by our side at every significant step from the point our campaign reaches its goal, to the moment the parcel is delivered to your door step.That is why, just as we did in our previous projects, we want to assure you that we will keep you in the loop with regular updates.

Made of vegetable-tanned calfskin, the unique hyde is high quality, durable and designed to turn heads.Other weekend bags become worn out and lose their shape. Meqnes can withstand all of your travels, wherever you may go.     For months, we searched high and low for the highest quality leather we could find. We needed something that would keep its shape and was beautiful enough to turn heads. Finally, we identified and chose an exquisite calfskin leather supplier in Poland. On par with our high standards, this full-grain calfskin is vegetable-tanned for a unique look and color. Most weekend bags, whether made of genuine leather or canvas, are destined to become floppy, unusable bags after time and years of use. We know we are not the first to design a beautiful leather bag, but we are confident in the fact we are the only one you will need for your weekend getaways.The high-quality leather we chose and the way each stitch is woven is designed to keep the shape of the bag through years of use. The sides of your Meqnes bag also do not collapse so you can easily see all four inside corners of your bag.     Meqnes comes in two colors, Sahara and Bullet to start, with more coming down the road as stretch goals! Every single one of our Meqnes bags is designed by extremely talented Moroccan artisans who understand the quality, aesthetic and promises we hold. These skilled artisans have been working for years in the traditional markets and understand the look and feel we are striving for.  Every stitch, buckle, color, zipper and handle has gone through a thorough check to ensure the traditions of Morocco are visible, in these bags which have been hand made with European leather. A simple look at the details of the Meqnes bag proves this to be true.  We use a three-step model to when it comes to creating and delivering our beautiful bags. First, our team hand-selects the materials for each weekender. Once the materials are selected, they are given to the skilled artisans we hire and they begin their magic. Once the bags are finished being hand-crafted, they are sent directly to you to enjoy. Just take a look below at everything we are cutting out compared to current luxury brands on the market.         Meqnes bags are the perfect size for all of your weekend necessities. Store larger items like a laptop, book or tablet in the side pocket. The zipper locks into place so you know your belongings are safe. Keep smaller items safe in the secure front pockets.

<p><u><strong><font color=""#1d2e5e"">♦ LoRa — Clear path for the antenna.</font></strong></u></p>
<p>The latest and greatest in the IoT, LoRa technology with its -140dbm sensitivity uses virtually no power and even in an off-grid environment can still broadcast a signal over a very long range.</p>
<p><u><strong><font color=""#1d2e5e"">♦ GPS — Towards clear skies for avoiding blockage of the receiver.</font></strong></u></p>
<p>Why a standalone GPS unit?</p>
<p>Simple - search and rescue can often take more than the 2-3 days of normal battery life in other GPS products, such as a cellphone, for example.</p>
<p><u><strong><font color=""#1d2e5e"">♦ </font></strong><u><strong><font color=""#1d2e5e"">Battery — A battery capacity of up to 30 days.</font></strong></u></u></p>
<p>You might not find yourself in a dangerous situation for several days into your adventure; that’s why you need the longest battery life possible.</p>

<h3><font color=""#1d2e5""><span style=""color:#75b43a;"">▲ </span>Why is ​TREKr part of a water bottle and not a standalone device?</font></h3>
<p>Simple - you can forget a standalone device, but you are much less likely to forget to bring along a water bottle. It is this combination of necessities, that sets TREKr apart from the competition.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Taking risks is exciting until it’s not. As the saying goes, “It’s all fun and games until someone loses an eye, or a leg, or an arm or their life.”</p>
<p>That’s why we created TREKr; to help prevent tragedies that could’ve been avoided. Nature is dangerous and everyone thinks and believes that nothing like that could ever happen to them. </p>
<p>The harsh reality is this: it can happen to you or to someone you know. Why risk your life unnecessarily with inferior products that offer <u>limited battery life, poor broadcast range and are fragile?</u></p>

<h3><font color=""#1d2e5""><span style=""color:#75b43a;"">▲ </span>FAQ</font></h3>
<p><u>01. What is the communication range?</u><br/>TREKr transmits up to 2 mile provided there are no objects to interfere with the coverage. </p>
<p><u>02. Do surroundings such as walls, woods or other giant objects affect the communication range?</u><br/>Yes – while there is tech behind the magic, there is no magic behind the tech. Factors such as terrain, air humidity etc. can influence any electromagnetic signals to varying degrees.</p>
<p><u>03. Will the TREKr base be compatible with both iPhones and Android phones (iOS and Android OS)?</u><br/>Yes, TREKr will be compatible with both iOS and Android OS. </p>
<p><u>04. How long does the battery last?</u><br/>When you use TREKr as a beacon only, the battery should last up to 30 days. The battery duration will decrease if used for Wi-Fi connection or the lantern function; therefore as a safety precaution, when the battery reaches 30% capacity remaining, TREKr will be automatically disable all other functions except for the Beacon function. At 30% or less battery capacity, will keep broadcasting the rescue beacon for between 5 to 6 days.</p>
<p><u>05. What makes the battery life in TREKr superior to other products currently on the market? </u><br/>TREKr uses the latest LoRa wireless technology, which specializes in long-distance transmission and ultra low power consumption. In addition, we also use a chip made from the world-leading brand - u-Blox - to make our GPS module; by a special motion detection algorithm, we have successfully taken the best advantage of the limited electricity available for maximum effect and duration.</p>
<p><u>06. How can I turn on the GPS on my bottle?</u><br/>Turn on your TREKr and the GPS will start to your position right away.</p>
<p><u>07. How accurate is the positioning of TREKr?</u><br/>TREKr is accurate to +/- 1 meter.</p>
<p><u>08. Where is the product developed and manufactured?</u><br/>The R&amp;D for TREKr was done 100% in Taiwan. We also cooperate with Foxconn (the main manufacturer of the iPhone) to manufacture TREKr.</p>
<p><u>09. Does it work globally?</u><br/>Yes, TREKr works anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><u>10. Is there a low battery indicator?</u><br/>Yes, there is a low battery indicator.</p>
<p><u>11. How many data sets can be stored in the app?</u><br/>TREKr stores more than a million data sets. </p>
<p><u>12.How do I connect TREKr to my mobile device?</u><br/>There are only three steps to connect TREKr to your mobile device. </p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on TREKr. </li>
<li>Connect TREKr via Wi-Fi on your mobile device. </li>
<li>Open the TREKr APP. </li>
</ol>
<p><u>13. How can I find my friends’ position in the TREKr APP?</u><br/>Once you connect TREKr to your mobile device, you can tap on the icons in the APP to read other users’ positioning, as well as other information such as the time, GPS history data and battery status, etc. </p>
<p><u>14. Can I just open the app and read other users’ positioning?</u> <br/>No, you can’t. You must connect your TREKr to the mobile device to read any other users (within detectable range) coordinates because TREKr only scans for another/other TREKr devices.</p>
<p><u>15. How does TREKr send network signals over long-distances?</u><br/>TREKr uses advanced Spread Spectrum and Channel Coding with LoRa technology to maximize signal reception (up to -140db). In the limited space of the lid, we have embedded a patterned customized antenna to maximize transmitting ability.</p>
<p><u>16. How much does TREKr weight?</u> <br/>TREKr weighs approximately 200g including the bottle (empty, of course).</p>
<p><u>17. Is the battery rechargeable?</u><br/>Yes, the battery can be recharged using a micro-USB.</p>
<p><u>18. Is there service fee or monthly fee for its use?</u> <br/>No, TREKr doesn't charge you any service or monthly fee. </p>
<p><u>19. Is TREKr drop-proof? </u> <br/>Absolutely – within reason, of course. Drop it from the height of a person, no problem.<br/>Drop it from an airplane at 10,000 feet – probably not.</p>
<p><u>20. What is the warranty?</u><br/>TREKr comes with a One (1) Year warranty. </p>
<p><u>21. How bright is the LED light?</u><br/>We are still testing different LED lamps at this time to provide the best user experience.</p>

<p><u>23. Can multiple TREKr users be linked together? </u><br/>Yes, once you turn on and connect TREKr to your mobile device, you can see other users within range.</p>
<p><u>24. How do I get GPS coordinates in the event of poor signal coverage? </u><br/>GPS coordinate readings may be delayed or slightly biased from the range +/- 1m ---&gt; +/- 5m or +/- 10m/ in the event of bad weather conditions or any object caused blockage. TREKr automatically stores your GPS coordinate history. It can provide your pals or even SAR (Search and Rescue) to your location by referring this data. </p>
<p><u>25. How long does it take to fully charge the battery?</u>  <br/>About 3 hours.</p>
<p><u>26. Can I reject a connection and choose not to be linked with other users?</u><br/>No, you can’t. We designed TREKr specifically to build a communication ‘network’ for users to be able to find and locate each other in the event of an emergency. Once any user turns on the device, they get double insurance by being positioned accurately and quickly updated in real time and should any of them send an SOS*, other users will immediately receive the message. </p>
<p>*There is a built-in SOS button for emergency situations.</p>
<p><u>27. About Shipping &amp; Logistics</u><br/>*Please note that your delivery schedule will differ for the following reasons - 1) Each country has different import procedures and the custom clearance formalities may cause delivery delays that we have no control over; also, 2）it may take time to obtain all required regulatory approvals (FCC and CE markings, etc. ) .<br/>*North America will be the priority of the delivery schedule.</p>
</div></div>","On a Water Bottle! Seriously? 
▲ For Optimal Performance, Space Matters!

♦ LoRa — Clear path for the antenna.
The latest and greatest in the IoT, LoRa technology with its -140dbm sensitivity uses virtually no power and even in an off-grid environment can still broadcast a signal over a very long range.
♦ GPS — Towards clear skies for avoiding blockage of the receiver.
Why a standalone GPS unit?
Simple - search and rescue can often take more than the 2-3 days of normal battery life in other GPS products, such as a cellphone, for example.
♦ Battery — A battery capacity of up to 30 days.
You might not find yourself in a dangerous situation for several days into your adventure; that’s why you need the longest battery life possible.

 
▲ Why is ​TREKr part of a water bottle and not a standalone device?
Simple - you can forget a standalone device, but you are much less likely to forget to bring along a water bottle. It is this combination of necessities, that sets TREKr apart from the competition.
 
▲ TREKr lid is compatible with all 63mm bottles of all sizes.

 
▲ Are you still risking your life with devices that work for less than 72 hours?
TREKr broadcasts your real-time locations in accuracy for more than 720 hours!!! 
Have you ever seen headlines like …


Missing hikers found dead after weeks long search. 
Hikers found dead after suffering from altitude sickness.
Hikers Mysteriously Disappeared!

Taking risks is exciting until it’s not. As the saying goes, “It’s all fun and games until someone loses an eye, or a leg, or an arm or their life.”
That’s why we created TREKr; to help prevent tragedies that could’ve been avoided. Nature is dangerous and everyone thinks and believes that nothing like that could ever happen to them. 
The harsh reality is this: it can happen to you or to someone you know. Why risk your life unnecessarily with inferior products that offer limited battery life, poor broadcast range and are fragile?
 
▲ Just take a look at TREKr’s specs and then compare them to other devices:


A  premium GPS module manufactured by the world-leading brand — u-Blox.
The latest wireless technology offering communication range up to 2 miles with an efficient antenna. 
30 day battery life. 
IPx7 rated housing to make TREKr tough enough for your hardcore adventures. 
An additional function - the built-in LED Lantern. 
BPA Free bottle material. 

Any of these features could potentially save your life or that of a fellow adventurer - so how much is saving your life - or someone else’s - worth? 
 
We didn’t make TREKr to get rich - we made it so that fewer people will become just another statistic.
Or, of course, you could buy something cheap that doesn’t have any of these functions and have your last thought while alive be this: I should’ve bought a instead. Someone will eventually find your body. Maybe​.

▲ About TREKr APP
♦ Build A Community:  You can see other TREKr users coordinates as well.
♦ Protect Your Teammates: TREKr excels at managing a team adventure via the alert function; you are notified as soon as a teammate is out of range.
♦ Share Your Location: As soon as you turn on TREKr and connect to a mobile device, you share your location with the other users.
♦ Call For Help In Emergencies: Press the SOS button and any TREKr users will be immediately notified of your emergency and with accurate GPS coordinates information, you can be found sooner.


 
▲ Main Features of TREKr!
♦ SOS button for emergencies: One button sends an emergency call which every TREKr user in valid range receives at once. And don’t forget that your location coordinates are broadcast constantly in real time as the moment you press the power-on.

♦ Communication works among all users: TREKr tends to make a big tent for all adventurers. Except for the private / group chat feature, all TREKr users in the world get the SOS alerts from anyone who sends an emergency call within valid range.

♦ 2 Mile Transmission Range: With the GPS module, both your location and that of other TREKr users will be accurately geopositioned.

♦ Off-the-Grid, still connected: The long-range radio technology and the premium GPS work without internet service. Just by pushing one button on the bottle, your SOS and position will be broadcast to other TREKr users within transmission range.

♦ 30 Day Battery Life: The battery lasts for up to 30 days on a single charge. Your location (and that of your friends)  is accurately and  constantly broadcast for up to 30 days in real time.

♦ Weather-Sealed IPx7 rated housing: TREKr is a GPS tracking device with a variety of inputs and outputs to cater to the most demanding applications. Its rugged housing is IPx7 rated to withstand any weather or environmental conditions, without sacrificing the performance of its tracking and other functional features.

♦ Built-in LED  as a lantern: You can also use TREKr as a light source via the lantern function.

 
▲ How Does TREKr Work for Adventurers?

♦ ANYWHERE: The possibilities are endless - No matter where you go, there you are!With up to a 2 mile signal coverage between TREKr bottles, you can worry less and go further.
♦ ANYTIME: Outstanding battery life - You’re protected from the moment your adventure starts!Your location (and that of your friends) is accurately and constantly broadcast for up to 30 days in real time.
♦ ANYONE: The best design is always the simplest - is intuitive and easy to operate; designed for first-time adventurers to seasoned veterans to use.
 
▲ Why TREKr? Best of all, you don’t pay any additional service fees!

 
▲ TECH & SPECS

 
▲ Future Products! The best can always get better!
Our next step is to develop further products to provide even better and more complete protection. But don’t worry - we promise that all of our future products will be compatible with TREKr.

♦ TREKr: The Original! For individual or team use.
Necessity and essential safety.
♦ Scanner:  For supervisor/leader use. 
Scanner is designed for rugged terrain that could interfere with transmission range. To help alleviate this problem, Scanner is able to be attached to, and work with, a drone which will increase the search radius and avoid the issue of no-signal or problematic areas.
♦ TREKr Pin: For kids, pets and items.
Maybe you don’t like a water bottle with real GPS. Maybe you’re not sure if your kids will be able to use it properly. Maybe you want to extend TREKr’s protection to your pets. No problem - we hear you! That’s why we’re developing TREKr pin with the same essential safety features!

And we've tried a whole bunch of light day packs in our years of travel and exploration. And all the day packs we tried had something in common: they were really uncomfortable. Whether it was something poking us in the back, or a strain in the shoulders in the early afternoon, it just wasn't worth it. The day would always end the same way: with us both sore and in pain. So we did what any exasperated product designer does: we designed a new daypack. One that still folds up into a tiny ball but expands into a full comfortable backpack.   The next-level comfort is thanks to our patent-pending air-cushioned support system that inflates in just one big breath. It's been described as like having a backpack made of clouds. Clouds that are gently hugging you for some reason. It might be a bit hyperbolic, but it's also SUPER comfy.The interconnected air cushions on the shoulders and back re-distribute the load and relieve any pressure points. The result is a drastically reduced stress and strain on your back, shoulders, and neck.When folded, it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. When it's unpacked and given a breath, it's a full-sized daypack ready to comfortably fit and carry all your things.                 33L Waterproof Main Compartment - Enough room to take it all with you and stay dry. Ultra-Strong, super-light, rugged, and waterproof - CORDURA fabric is a high-quality fabric used by brands, retailers and even militaries around the world to create lasting, quality products that hold up to the CORDURA brand's high criteria. Duraflex Buckle - An extra snap that keeps your Air Pack tight and secure.Double Bottom Layer - Durable even against the roughest grounds.Water Resistant Reflective Zipper - A premium zipper with a strong safety feature Adjustable Stability Straps (Load Lifter) For maximum fit and comfort Adjustable Sternum Strap - For comfort and stability when on the move Removable Waist Strap - For more support and even more snug fit Easy Access Front Pocket - Easily grab or store your stuffDeep Side Pockets - Extra deep, to hold your water bottle or other essentials. Slips on Suitcase Handle - For convenient travel Built-in Safety Whistle - For emergenciesTREXAD is founded by Daniel & Ella.We are Ph.Ds who love to travel whenever we can.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">I know how strong, kind and generous the vanlife Community is and after a friend recommended to me that I start a crowdfunding campaign I thought to myself what do I have to lose. Just like everyone else due to covid ive struggle to find work so I am solely reliant on the money I make through my business advertising for small start ups on social media. This makes me around £600 a month which works out to £100 to £200 after bills, credit card payments and food. my total expenses for getting a van to live in would be around £7000 up front and I just don’t have that kind of money right now so I’m hoping the vanlife Community can come together to help support me on getting started </p>

Here is my soundcloud if you want to check out what Music ive made so far!Why choose to live in a van? I’m always looking for things to spark inspiration for my music and projects, in fact I designed and made a prototype of a wall mounted/kickstand phone holder with portable charging, speakers and leds out of a box of broken electronics I had after coming back from camping with friends one day. Unfortunately I didn’t have the funds to make a 2nd better prototype but here is a picture of the first product I ever made! 

 

Why do I need crowdfunding to get a van?
I know how strong, kind and generous the vanlife Community is and after a friend recommended to me that I start a crowdfunding campaign I thought to myself what do I have to lose. Just like everyone else due to covid ive struggle to find work so I am solely reliant on the money I make through my business advertising for small start ups on social media. This makes me around £600 a month which works out to £100 to £200 after bills, credit card payments and food. my total expenses for getting a van to live in would be around £7000 up front and I just don’t have that kind of money right now so I’m hoping the vanlife Community can come together to help support me on getting started 
What’s my plans after getting a van?Once I move into my van my plan is quite simple really, I want to hit the road and travel whist saving enough money to invest in all my projects.

<p>When kayak fishing, you often need your arms and hands free for fishing. The optional ImpulseDrive easily pops into its slot in the KingFisher kayak and effectively propels you forward and backward using leg power. The pedal drive unit is extremely light-weight and is one of the few pedal-driven units on the market that can be driven both forward - and in reverse. With your largest muscle group in play, kayak fishing becomes easier and more efficient than ever.</p>

<p>The Impulse Drive is a revolutionary pedal-drive system designed around a very simple premise: if a product is designed to be used in the water it should be 100% corrosion proof. Featuring a high performance encased shaft drive design, that is immune to water damage, the Impulse Drive will not corrode or degrade in water. Not only does this design dramatically reduce wear but it also provides a high-performance system that is 100% user serviceable. The Impulse Drive is incredibly versatile for the retailer and end user.</p>

<p>The Trimaran hull is the secret to the KingFisher's stability, speed, and lightweight design. Trimarans evoke a vision of stability.  A conventional monohull must balance conflicting needs of resistance and stability.  You want a narrow, skinny hull to reduce resistance and paddling effort, but you need a wide hull to maintain vessel stability and keep the kayak upright.  The trimaran separates these two design requirements by using three strategically-placed hulls to maximize stability but keep the overall width to a minimum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561387044/wcdsbmeddxr8xp8t8pc6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>In order to maintain the same stability in a regular monohull kayak, the hull width must be wider.  A wider hull makes the kayak awkward and cumbersome to paddle, adds extra weight, and significantly decreases portability.</p>

We're proud to present the brand new Point 65 KingFisher, the world's first modular trimaran fishing kayak.   We wanted to make owning a fishing kayak easy. A kayak that can take you anywhere - regardless of how much space or strength you have to store and carry it. A kayak that’s as easy to handle outside the water as it is on it.    Modular kayaks can go places most kayaks can’t. The two halves of the KingFisher snap apart in seconds and easily fit into your car, apartment or even as checked-in luggage on an airplane. Plus, half a kayak is twice as easy to carry! One person can easily load, unload and assemble the KingFisher. No roof-racks or storage space? No problem!  The KingFisher’s flexibility doesn’t stop with its modular design. You have the choice of using your legs, arms, or motor to get where you want to go. The slender hull design makes for smooth, effortless paddle strokes if you want to go the old-fashioned route. The optional Impulse Drive is ready and waiting when you need your hands free, using the power of your legs to propel you forward or backward. Steering is a breeze with our handy rudder controls and you can fit almost any motor to the KingFisher's aft deck.    A fishing kayak that still feels like a kayak. This beautifully designed boat melts into the natural surroundings. No disturbing wake, no loud noises or smelly motor fumes. Feel relaxed as you paddle, sit, stand, and fish. All with complete confidence in the KingFisher to support your weight and movements.   With multiple settings & heights, the Game Chair adjusts to you - not the other way round. Perfect for when you’re patiently waiting for the next bite, setting up your line, or wrangling your latest catch!   This boat is decked out with everything you need to have the best possible fishing experience. Multiple Rod Parks, super-comfy adjustable Game Chair, two spacious storage hatches and plenty of compatible attachment rails and bars for anything else you want to add on top.   All of our kayaks are made from high quality, durable, moulded HTP plastics free from harmful chemicals and dyes. The material used is 100% recyclable, and all manufacturing remnants (like cut out hatches) are recycled. We put every model through extensive durability testing to make a product that will last through many adventures. And, thanks to our 'modular' spare parts design system, if any piece gets damaged or broken, you can easily replace an individual part instead of scrapping your entire kayak.  When designing the KingFisher, we set out to tackle the biggest challenges of owning a fishing kayak.               


 


When kayak fishing, you often need your arms and hands free for fishing. The optional ImpulseDrive easily pops into its slot in the KingFisher kayak and effectively propels you forward and backward using leg power. The pedal drive unit is extremely light-weight and is one of the few pedal-driven units on the market that can be driven both forward - and in reverse. With your largest muscle group in play, kayak fishing becomes easier and more efficient than ever.
 

 
The Impulse Drive is a revolutionary pedal-drive system designed around a very simple premise: if a product is designed to be used in the water it should be 100% corrosion proof. Featuring a high performance encased shaft drive design, that is immune to water damage, the Impulse Drive will not corrode or degrade in water. Not only does this design dramatically reduce wear but it also provides a high-performance system that is 100% user serviceable. The Impulse Drive is incredibly versatile for the retailer and end user.
 


 
The Trimaran hull is the secret to the KingFisher's stability, speed, and lightweight design. Trimarans evoke a vision of stability.  A conventional monohull must balance conflicting needs of resistance and stability.  You want a narrow, skinny hull to reduce resistance and paddling effort, but you need a wide hull to maintain vessel stability and keep the kayak upright.  The trimaran separates these two design requirements by using three strategically-placed hulls to maximize stability but keep the overall width to a minimum.
 

 

In order to maintain the same stability in a regular monohull kayak, the hull width must be wider.  A wider hull makes the kayak awkward and cumbersome to paddle, adds extra weight, and significantly decreases portability.
 


 
Featuring one of the most comfortable seats on the kayak fishing market, the KingFisher Game Chair offers a variety of settings to give you a comfortable and effective paddling position. The super comfy KingFisher Game Chair, combined with the kayak´s world-class stability, speed, and logical accessory positioning, makes it a serious fishing machine in all water types.
  

 

Multiple marine-grade aluminum attachment rails are fitted along the KingFisher allowing for maximum flexibility for how you would like to customize your kayak.  The front, middle and rear sections have rails along both sides and can fit RAM, Scotty, or other accessories securely. 
 


 
Flush-mounted rod holders are located on either side of the Kingfisher, with integrated rod-holder recesses and rod-tip protectors. You can relax knowing your rods will be held in place while you paddle, pedal or motor through the water. 
 

 The KingFisher has well-placed, generous storage space for all your gear. Below the Game Chair, you'll find space for your tackle boxes for easy access. There are front and rear hatches with a removable liner for equipment, battery packs, etc. There is also a rear cargo area with secure bungees and floor-mounted aluminum rails.  The super efficient, hand-controlled twin rudders help you maneuver your KingFisher with ease and precision. The dual steering handles with fingertip control are located on either side of the Game Chair, and the rudders can be locked in place to give you more options for steering.    Shipping to Zone  1: Shipping is $199Shipping to Zone 2: Shipping is $399For our backers in the United States, our trusted distributors Liberty Mountain will take care of shipping your kayak once the container delivery is made from our European factory.

<h3 style=""color:#00539f;"">Why did I (Jason) start MEZURIT?</h3>
<p>There were so many cases when I wanted to know the size of objects. But I couldn't do it immediately because I had no ruler or tape at hand to: </p>
<ul>
<li>measure the size of my carry-on luggage at the airport to save money.</li>
<li>check if my new furniture would fit through the door.</li>
<li>find out the size of the painting, vase, etc.</li>
<li>assess what package I need for the thing I wanted to ship and how much I have to pay for its shipment. </li>
</ul>
<p>So I realized there was a necessity to create a tool that would always be in my pocket, would not require any additional stuff and would be quick to make the measurements I need. That's how it started.</p>
<p>I found people who were passionate about my idea and the work began.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#00539f;"">What have we already made?</h3>
<p>We have a working prototype of  MEZURIT-Travel App. It measures the size of objects using a smartphone camera.</p>
<p>Now I measure the size of my carry-on luggage just with my smartphone. So can you! </p>
<p>It does so with the help of built-in algorithms. All you need is to put a credit card next to the object. It's never been so easy!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493051764/hjqkewy6xwhlimlpjits.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We need a credit card to use as a reference marker with known dimensions. We have chosen a credit card because its size is standard in all the countries throughout the world.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#ff0000;text-align:center;"">What do we want to add and improve? </h3>
<p><i>1. We want to sophisticate our algorithms. </i></p>
<p>We are eager to adopt the promising approach of our scientist and developer. It is based on Neural Networks (NN) and Optical Image Processing with MATLAB. The approach uses the committees of NN trained on different scale images. Our experiments at image processing show that designed classifiers are effective and can ensure a significant accuracy. Therefore, we would like to make a core on its base.</p>
<p>Why do we want to sophisticate the algorithms? - To increase the accuracy of measurements up to 99% (now it's 95%). </p>
<p><i>2. We also want to expand the MEZURIT family: to create a MEZURIT-Home app, a MEZURIT-Build one, and a MEZURIT-Cargo app. </i></p>
<p>The <span style=""color:#00539f;font-weight:bold;"">MEZURIT-Home</span> will measure the size of furniture pieces and objects we find in our homes. It will come so handy when you order new pieces or you want to make some changes in your home. Additionally, it will have special features related to the home sphere, as in the case with MEZURIT-Travel with which you can check-in on the go.</p>
<p>The <span style=""color:#00539f;font-weight:bold;"">MEZURIT-Build</span> will measure the sizes of windows, doors, and whatsoever needs to be measured when it comes to reconstruction of houses and apartments. It will be useful both for professionals and for non-professionals. </p>
<p>The <span style=""color:#00539f;font-weight:bold;"">MEZURIT-Cargo</span> app will measure the size of things you want to ship and will make the necessary calculations in order to tell you how much you will have to pay for it to be shipped and what package you need for it. It will also measure cargos and calculate for you the shipping expenses and warehouse fees. </p>
<p>So in short, the core feature of the 3 apps is the same - the measuring algorithms. However, each app will have (and already has - if we take MEZURIT-Travel) its unique features according to its sphere of application - travelling, building, home, logistics. For example, you can check-in with MEZURIT-Travel. </p>

We need a credit card to use as a reference marker with known dimensions. We have chosen a credit card because its size is standard in all the countries throughout the world.
What do we want to add and improve? 
1. We want to sophisticate our algorithms. 
We are eager to adopt the promising approach of our scientist and developer. It is based on Neural Networks (NN) and Optical Image Processing with MATLAB. The approach uses the committees of NN trained on different scale images. Our experiments at image processing show that designed classifiers are effective and can ensure a significant accuracy. Therefore, we would like to make a core on its base.
Why do we want to sophisticate the algorithms? - To increase the accuracy of measurements up to 99% (now it's 95%). 
2. We also want to expand the MEZURIT family: to create a MEZURIT-Home app, a MEZURIT-Build one, and a MEZURIT-Cargo app. 
The MEZURIT-Home will measure the size of furniture pieces and objects we find in our homes. It will come so handy when you order new pieces or you want to make some changes in your home. Additionally, it will have special features related to the home sphere, as in the case with MEZURIT-Travel with which you can check-in on the go.
The MEZURIT-Build will measure the sizes of windows, doors, and whatsoever needs to be measured when it comes to reconstruction of houses and apartments. It will be useful both for professionals and for non-professionals. 
The MEZURIT-Cargo app will measure the size of things you want to ship and will make the necessary calculations in order to tell you how much you will have to pay for it to be shipped and what package you need for it. It will also measure cargos and calculate for you the shipping expenses and warehouse fees. 
So in short, the core feature of the 3 apps is the same - the measuring algorithms. However, each app will have (and already has - if we take MEZURIT-Travel) its unique features according to its sphere of application - travelling, building, home, logistics. For example, you can check-in with MEZURIT-Travel.

How will it save your money and time?

Save on airlines fees. Check your luggage dimensions and compare them with an airline allowance. Choose the luggage of the right size for your trip.
Moving to a new flat is tough. Learn what truck is necessary for your furniture. 
Check if a furniture piece can fit through your door or whether it can fit in a certain place in the room.
Do you want to order new windows or doors for your apartment? Get the size of a window/doorway, then compare the prices among suppliers.
Assess what package you need for the thing you want to ship and how much money you'll have to pay for. 
Are you a regular customer of freight-forwarding services? If yes, then MEZURIT-Cargo can substantially ease your life by calculating the expenses and fees depending on the size of your cargo. 
Are you just curious about the size of the thing?
And many more other options.

Your feedback is highly valuable. We will be grateful to hear it from you after you download the app. Help us become better.




A journey is best measured in friends, MEZURIT will measure everything else.

<p>If you’re got time, I’ll take you allll the way back, because it’s interesting how ideas evolve and can lead somewhere you never expected. </p>
<p>2015 Back at the start of 2015 I went on a road-trip with my boyfriend (let’s call him Foster...) from Las Vegas, across the Joshua Tree desert to LA, then up the coast to San Francisco. It was an awesome trip and pretty special driving through the Mojave desert in our rented Mustang. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536961792/dgm0gppne60wvudl2b44.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A map and the open road, Joshua Tree</p>
<p>For Foster's next birthday I got a little crafty, and stitched the road map that we’d used to navigate the whole way with some colourful thread to mark the route we’d taken. It made a pretty nice gift and he was chuffed since he loves maps. We framed it and it still hangs in our living room. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536961968/gslr8zpscswrqhve7xrp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My stitched USA road map</p>
<p>From there this idea of stitching your travels and using thread to show a journey hugely appealed to me. Paper was fragile so I started looking at alternatives… </p>
<p>2016 The idea for the fabric Cross Stitch Map was born and quirky gift company, Suck UK, where I worked at the time, started to manufacture them. These caught the imagination of many others, being stocked in Urban Outfitters, John Lewis, Uncommon Goods &amp; many more.</p>

<p>Cross Stitch wall map I designed for Suck UK</p>
<p>2017  I left Suck to start developing my own products and started to experiment with ‘stitchable’ maps in new materials and different products. </p>

<p>First samples of the stitchable range made from cotton and leather</p>
<p>I launched Maid In China Ltd (did I mention I like puns), manufacturing ceramic products &amp; homeware, as well as the first batch of passport covers &amp; luggage tags. </p>
<p>2018 The collection of passport covers &amp; luggage tags grew to form a bigger range and it became necessary to give them their own sub-brand. Hello: Chasing Threads.</p>

In this fast-paced technological world, it’s nice to slow down – use your hands, put pen to paper and needle through fabric.
The leather cover is removable so each trip can be stored in a new notebook. Capture years of memories by building up your own travel library.

Extra refill notebooks are available separately or you can use any other A5 notebook refill - so you can continue to fill new Travel Notebooks for years to come.


Genuine leather cover printed with gold world map
Elasticated pen holder
'Round the world' tie cloing
A5 notebook with 120 x lined pages (100 gsm)
'Date' and 'Location' headers on each page 
Comes with 2m emerald & 3m gold thread & 1 x needle
Stitch Travel Notebook will come packaged with 2 x threads & 1 needle

Use the notebook as a journal or scrapbook for your travels



Designed and ready to manufacture, these unique notebooks are ready to be ordered. But investing in a new product isn't cheap and that's where you come in. With your help, I can raise the money for their production and get these into the world, and off on some amazing adventures!
If you like the idea, and you’d want to fill your cover with stitches and your pages with memories, then please do pledge or share with your travel loving friends! You can also grab yourself other items from the Chasing Threads collection as a reward, which all adds towards the funding total.
These would make a great Christmas gift, arriving in plenty of time for the festive season. Or, invest in the Globe-trotter Bundle and you would have Christmas sewn up…?! 

Though the Stitch Travel Notebook is a new product, I have been selling the other items from the collection for over 18 months and have received some lovely reviews. Here are a few of my favourites...


If you’re got time, I’ll take you allll the way back, because it’s interesting how ideas evolve and can lead somewhere you never expected. 
2015 Back at the start of 2015 I went on a road-trip with my boyfriend (let’s call him Foster...) from Las Vegas, across the Joshua Tree desert to LA, then up the coast to San Francisco. It was an awesome trip and pretty special driving through the Mojave desert in our rented Mustang. 

A map and the open road, Joshua Tree
For Foster's next birthday I got a little crafty, and stitched the road map that we’d used to navigate the whole way with some colourful thread to mark the route we’d taken. It made a pretty nice gift and he was chuffed since he loves maps. We framed it and it still hangs in our living room. 

My stitched USA road map
From there this idea of stitching your travels and using thread to show a journey hugely appealed to me. Paper was fragile so I started looking at alternatives… 
2016 The idea for the fabric Cross Stitch Map was born and quirky gift company, Suck UK, where I worked at the time, started to manufacture them. These caught the imagination of many others, being stocked in Urban Outfitters, John Lewis, Uncommon Goods & many more.

Cross Stitch wall map I designed for Suck UK
2017  I left Suck to start developing my own products and started to experiment with ‘stitchable’ maps in new materials and different products. 

First samples of the stitchable range made from cotton and leather
I launched Maid In China Ltd (did I mention I like puns), manufacturing ceramic products & homeware, as well as the first batch of passport covers & luggage tags. 
2018 The collection of passport covers & luggage tags grew to form a bigger range and it became necessary to give them their own sub-brand. Hello: Chasing Threads.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>ORIGIN STORY </h2>
<p>Walden Hammocks were designed by an outdoors-man who found that having to pack and carry multiple pieces of gear to provide shelter was cumbersome. So, he made a hammock that could be easily converted into multiple different survival shelters.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS THE WALDEN HAMMOCK? </h2>
<p>The Walden is a patent pending hammock design that has a system of channels and attached guidelines enabling it to quickly transform into a variety of shelters. Not only has it been designed with a variety of adventures in mind, it's also been designed to best protect against the elements. It's made of 70D ripstop nylon with polyurethane coating. It's water proof and completely seam sealed, it can hold over 500 lbs, and it has a stitched border that ensures for even tightening of the shelter. Plus, we had comfort in mind. The wide panel in the middle means that when relaxing in the hammock, you won't have a seam running down your back.</p>

<h2>DON'T GET CAUGHT WITHOUT SHELTER</h2>
<p>The great outdoors are a wondrous place, until they are a dangerous place. Even on simple outdoor excursions, the right equipment can be the difference between life and death. Use the Walden Hammock to protect you from sudden and unexpected weather. Protecting yourself from getting wet can help prevent hypothermia. Or, protecting yourself from the sun on a hot day can help prevent heat stroke.</p>

</div></div>","ORIGIN STORY 
Walden Hammocks were designed by an outdoors-man who found that having to pack and carry multiple pieces of gear to provide shelter was cumbersome. So, he made a hammock that could be easily converted into multiple different survival shelters.







WHAT IS THE WALDEN HAMMOCK? 
The Walden is a patent pending hammock design that has a system of channels and attached guidelines enabling it to quickly transform into a variety of shelters. Not only has it been designed with a variety of adventures in mind, it's also been designed to best protect against the elements. It's made of 70D ripstop nylon with polyurethane coating. It's water proof and completely seam sealed, it can hold over 500 lbs, and it has a stitched border that ensures for even tightening of the shelter. Plus, we had comfort in mind. The wide panel in the middle means that when relaxing in the hammock, you won't have a seam running down your back.

Thoughtfully Designed. Quality Made.


DON'T GET CAUGHT WITHOUT SHELTER
The great outdoors are a wondrous place, until they are a dangerous place. Even on simple outdoor excursions, the right equipment can be the difference between life and death. Use the Walden Hammock to protect you from sudden and unexpected weather. Protecting yourself from getting wet can help prevent hypothermia. Or, protecting yourself from the sun on a hot day can help prevent heat stroke.
EASY TO SET UP
Each tie down point can be used to secure the shelter with a hiking pole, stick, or stake. Each tie down point has a guideline attached to the tarp so you can adjust from under the tarp, that way you don't need to tighten from all of the various tie down points. Each guideline has its own pocket so you don’t have a rats nest of cordage when pulling it out, and you don’t lose it.
 EASY TO PACK
The Walden Hammock comes in an easy to carry compression sack. Not only does the hammock fit easily within sack, but there's also room for straps and stakes. This is one piece of gear you won't struggle to get back in it's original packaging.

 
WHERE CAN WALDEN TAKE YOU?

RELAXATION WHEN YOU WANT IT, SHELTER WHEN YOU NEED IT.

<h3><b>Why do we need your support?</b></h3>
<p>Other than the tooling and materials needed for us to start our campaign and the costs of setting up our logistics network, we truly feel that more can be done to help the millions of refugees around the world. So, we have chosen to give our support to the U.N refugee relief efforts by donating a good percentage of our sales to help with this crisis around the globe. Our philosophy is that for each powerbank you order, you are helping others who need power even more. </p>

Introducing Nomadi, the world’s first mobile charging journal. We have worked very hard and went through countless iterations of designs to arrive at what we consider the perfect combination of traditional and contemporary aesthetics.





        








Our Journal is designed for those with the traveler's soul — for those who embrace the elegance in being bold and adventurous. We chose the design to reflect the fabrics of the local Nomadic tribes in our region. They are known for their endurance, hospitality, love of music, dance, and travel.





100 sheets of paper to record your meetings, ideas, and adventures, a sleeve and four cards slots to help you carry your important cards and documents with you. The battery was designed to fit perfectly between the papers providing your phone or camera with up to 300% of its charging capacity. What more can one need in a travel companion?



The Limited Edition Nomadi features 176 dated pages for the upcoming 2016 calendar year. The daily pages also have Arabic dates in consideration for the regional market.

Features



Four card slots
Passport holder / side pocket
Pen loop
A5 Filofax

100 blank pages ( 2016 diary exclusively for Limited Edition Nomadi)
3-in-1 charging cable

8,000 mAh powerbank (One-Year Warranty)

Why do we need your support?
Other than the tooling and materials needed for us to start our campaign and the costs of setting up our logistics network, we truly feel that more can be done to help the millions of refugees around the world. So, we have chosen to give our support to the U.N refugee relief efforts by donating a good percentage of our sales to help with this crisis around the globe. Our philosophy is that for each powerbank you order, you are helping others who need power even more. 



Millions of families have been dislocated from their homes by war around the world, People just like us, but who have lost everything... family, friends, careers, homes, and years and years of hard work, all gone in circumstances that they had no hand in. 
Now we see the children of doctors, engineers, teachers, and businessmen starving in the streets and camps, while their parents are working 18 hours a day for less than minimum wage.




This needs to change. They need us especially in the coming winter, where a blanket and a heat source can mean the difference between living and dying to them. Civil war can happen anywhere and at anytime and it is our duty to stand by the side of our fellow humans.

Risks & Challenges
 We have been in the game of manufacturing and designing for over eight years, with a combined experience of over 40 years in the field. We are very confident of our ability to deliver this product to you.
Our main concern is receiving the bare minimum funds we need to start the manufacturing process, and to provide everyone with as low a cost as possible without compromising our quality standards.
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Please, get the word out, and make some noise about this campaign! let's raise those funds, unlock some stretch goals, and provide more refugees with the care they need. Use the Indiegogo share tool for an easy and simple share on your page, or just copy the URL above and send it to your friends and family.




Thank YouWe are very proud of the international community and we have never felt as touched as we do today by all the humanitarian souls out there. To all of you who are giving what you can to help out other people during the turbulent time that we live in, from the deepest stretch of our hearts, thank you for making us believe again.

About this project
LED blocks are fully compatible with your current building blocks, the same form factor of the standard 2x4 blocks. This is an evolution of the classic family favorite to bring a new dimension to your designs/play and no need to replace your current blocks, just add then in (no wires), imagine your  creation can also become a night light. Don't limit yourself.


Blocks are illuminated from within by LED's, a single block has an input from an external battery and all subsequent blocks are powered/illuminated automatically when they are added onto any other block that is already lit up (on top or below, no wires between blocks).


Just like normal blocks, LED blocks are transportable and kid safe (they can take a few good knocks as
well), no need for replacing tiny batteries per block.
Simply recharge the main battery pack (the battery pack lasts a really long time as LED's are low power users).

This is a fun anytime activity and teaching your child about colour's /electricity,
and it’s also just really cool as well.

Early Bird special consists of the following:

15 x normal (4x2 size) LED illuminated blocks (either
BLUE, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, Transparent)


1 x normal (4x2 size) LED Illuminated input
block (Random Colour’s)


1 x lead to connect input block with battery
pack (Random Colour’s)


1 x battery case (Random Colour’s)

Each block is the same form factor as the
classic 4x2 size and made from a similar type of plastic, the main difference
is that it is semi-transparent & diffused and illuminated from within (but
no battery in the blocks).So it’s safe to mix it up with all your other blocks



How does it work?

Imagine if your flash light fell in love with
your classic building blocks. 

Each
block is lit up from within, with its own LED with a low Volt direct current
(big words I know).
In a nutshell its very safe, and each block relays the
current to the next, and so on, with only a single block requiring to be
connected to the battery pack (no need to break up your creations at night any
more, just switch it on).

An amazing device that allows you to fish without ever having to tie a knot! Fishing is one of the greatest outings a family or group of friends can enjoy. We put the technology away, get some sun, and talk to the people we love face to face.

<h2>The concept:</h2>
<p>I have bought many bags in my life that were either minimal and professional or military bags that accompanied me in my wildest trips. Then, I turned to multifunctional bags, which were indeed ‘multi’ yet not always ‘functional’. What makes Elveden Hunter unique is not only its ability to be both uni and multi - functional, but also the efficiency of transforming from one use to the other. </p>
<p>On one hand, Elveden Hunter’s design incorporates a combination of colours and materials that make it a professional yet stylish work bag, while its smallest version can carry your daily essentials. On the other hand, Elveden Hunter is thoroughly constructed to its smallest detail to fulfil your needs in any long or short term trip, with buckles, straps and D-rings that won’t let you down and boost its functionality. </p>
<p>However, the most amazing feature of Elveden Hunter is that it can easily alter its function, as the straps will reconstruct it from a 5l to 32l bag in seconds, giving you every centimetre you need and its incorporated details are beneficial even on a day to work. Elveden is the right bag for you if you are a busy professional, an expert adventurer, or both!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<ul>
<li>We are starting our production after being successfully funded on Kickstarter</li>
<li>As all our backers, you'll get a full Hunter experience, receiving, included in the price, all our accessories like the net mesh helmet holder, the dry sack and the utility/camera/lunch bag!</li>
<li>Deliveries are estimated for September 2018</li>

<li>Elveden is an original concept for those people who fulfil their lives with daily adventures.</li>
<li>You might be a crazy workaholic or a tireless traveler. You'll always find Hunter the first companion to take with you</li>
<li>Made of a life-proof waxed canvas, sturdy and soft to touch. We used the best hardware as well to give you a perfect quality, day by day. Just bear in mind, we created Hunter for ourselves first of all, and for this reason, it had to be amazingly builded.</li>

<p>Production Run – We have gained an incredible amount of traction in our first Kickstarter campaign in May! Over 250 backers, 15+ countries and much useful feedback validated our product. We need your help to raise enough money to fulfill our first run of backpacks.</p>
<p>Customization – We have teamed up with a local stitchery and textile facility that will help us produce the “U-Design” concept, custom SkateCro grip and much more. With your funds, we can establish an exclusive relationship with their facility. Our lead times will continue to be shortened with your help.</p>
<p>Licensing – Our new concepts are a great opportunity for licensing. Imagine your favorite college, professional or local high school / little league team’s color on your back. Imagine the ability to change the design of your backpack anytime without having to buy a new backpack! With your support, we can gain the licensing agreements and prove our viability in the sport’s enthusiasts market.</p>
<p>Graphic Content – We have partnered up with NPI Productions, a local videography company that will provide us with monthly, updated videos and photos. This will help Unitty create a brand that customers world-wide will be able to relate to.</p>
<p>Trade Show – We are planning to attend Surf Expo 2017 in January in our hometown of Orlando, Fl. With your support, we can be amongst the top companies in the United States, exhibiting our product to buyers world-wide.

The BUNDL sleeping bag is the first of its kind, bringing instant warmth while you're out in nature roughing it. What Makes the BUNDL Sleeping Bag Different? For the last 18 months, the BUNDL team has researched the market, tested products, and asked campers what would make their camping sleep-experience better. We've developed amazing features so that you have the best sleeping bag possible. Check out our features below and see for yourself.   The BUNDL BAG incorporates a unique heating solution. Instead of using copper wiring, BUNDL implements a patented carbon heating material that is light-weight, waterproof, comfortable, and seamlessly integrated. This paper-thin heated fabric consumes less energy than your typical copper wire solutions.    The BUNDL sensors monitor temperature throughout the night to regulate your preferred heat settings. The sensors prevent overheating and extend battery life.  Like our heating elements, the sensors are extremely small—you won’t even notice them.The BlueTooth sensors and mobile app connect up to 50 yards away. So while you are still at the campfire, you can heat up your bag even before you call it a night.  The BUNDL app allows you to customize your sleep experience. Turn on your sleeping bag across the campsite, control the temperature of your bag, turn the 3 different heated panels off and on, and adjust all 3 panels to your preferred temperature:So if your feet are freezing while you sleep but the rest of your body is just fine, simply turn up the heat for the FOOT Box and turn off the panels for the HOOD and MID sections.   The BUNDL app also allows you to view your stats—so you're never left wondering how much battery life you have left,  how long the battery will last based on the outdoor temperature, or what temperatures you experienced the previous night.Forgot your phone or camping without one? See section below.  The BUNDL button allows you to turn on your sleeping bag without the app. Some campers love to truly disconnect and leave their phones behind, and that's why we added a power button. This button has 4 different temperature settings just in case you don’t have your phone to adjust the settings manually. By initially pressing the power button for 2-3 seconds, you turn on the heating panels at 100% power output. If you press the button again, the output drops to 75%. Press again, and the power output drops to 50%. Press one more time and the power output drops to 25%. Hold the button down for 2-3 seconds to turn off.     The power button is encapsulated in rubber which makes it completely waterproof, and it's strategically placed so it doesn't cause any discomfort.*Stuff Sack included* All the components that make up the BUNDL Electric Heated Sleeping Bag compress down to the size of your water bottle.The BUNDL BATTERY is portable yet powerful. It has enough energy to keep you warm for multiple nights, charge your phone, and give you peace of mind while you camp. Charge your battery before you pack, as you drive, or even with our solar option.  Battery Features 
Duration lasts at least four nights (depending on the outdoor temperature).
Multifunctional Powerbank lets you charge almost any device.
Small volume, large capacity up to 30,000mAh, maximum output of 78W.
Ability to power MacBook for 15 hours and charge the iPhone XS eight times.
Stylish and slim aluminum-body ensures good heat dissipation and protection.
Security protection design: short-circuit and over-current protection. 
Device automatically shuts down if a short circuit or overload output occurs.
Lithium Polymer Battery Cells are more stable and safer than Lithium Ion batteries.

   The BUNDL design gives your feet and arms the freedom and space needed for maximum comfort. With the double zipper design, you can open up the foot box while you are sleeping to cool down or open it up to walk around. The unique arm holes give you full mobility outside without sacrificing warmth. The BUNDL media pouch allows you to store small miscellaneous items that you want close by (like your phone or flash light). With our stretch goal, we will even integrate a phone charger right in the pouch!The BUNDL pillow pouch gives you the space to use your own inflatable pillow, or pack in some other form of padding (like a hoodie or tomorrow's clothes).  BUNDL down is responsibly sourced.""The Responsible Down Standard aims to ensure that down and feathers come from animals that have not been subjected to an unnecessary harm.

<h3>What's This?</h3>
<p>Support some ambitious young climbers hoping to go on an inspiring adventure to Western Greenland.</p>
<p>In summer 2013, a team of climbers from the Oxford University Mountaineering Club will partner with a team of sailors to put together an expedition to the regions of Uummannaq and Upernavik in West Greenland. The journey will involve sailing nearly 2500 nautical miles into well above the Arctic Circle. The climbing will aim for first ascents and adventurous new routes on Big Walls in one of the most recently opened and exciting climbing areas in the world.</p>
<p>Arctic Greenland is a uniquely beautiful environment which is particularly vulnerable to the deprecations of the modern world, we hope to offer an insight into this fragile wilderness. Climate change has caused rapid receding of the Arctic ice, and the recent discovery and exploration of oil reserves in Disko Bay and Uummannaq highlight the need for public awareness of this unique and pristine environment. We hope to create an exciting, inspiring story through a short film, blogs, articles and video diaries, so people can get to know West Greenland. Helping to preserve and protect this great wilderness is a major part of our endeavours and we hope to lead by example in promoting sustainable adventure. The expedition will be self contained waste wise and leave no trace of human passage. We intend to follow established local ethics by avoiding the placement of bolts wherever possible, thereby minimising our impact on the cliffs.</p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Although there are a limited number of grants available to expeditions like this, we desperately need additional funding to make the venture affordable. That's where you come in.</p>
<p>Thanks to the enthusiasm of Clive Woodman and Angela Lilienthal, the major expense of the trip (the boat!) will be met. These are the remaining costs, totalling £15,000 for all seven of us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance - £3,000 -  this is the big one, and the unique nature of our expedition means this becomes very expensive. </li>
<li>General boat-related expenses - £7,000 - this includes paper charts, boat insurance, mooring fees, living costs, satellite phone airtime, diesel, a new liferaft and unavoidable minor damage repair. This stuff doesn't come cheap unfortunately...</li>
<li>Equipment - £2,000 - this includes crucial warm and waterproof clothing, a portaledge, gun hire to deter polar bears from eating us (I kid you not - a legal requirement for expeditions in Greenland), spare ropes, freight costs, communications equipment and other sundry items</li>
<li>Flights - £3,000 - to Canada and back from Greenland.</li>
</ul><p>We've set our target at £1,000 in the hope that this campaign will allow us to buy crucial insurance cover for the climbing part of the trip. Any funds over this amount will be used to insure the sailing part.</p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>Apart from sharing the adventure and the challenge, we're offering a number of small rewards for your generosity:</p>
<ul>
<li>For £5 or more, we'll send you a signed <strong>thank-you letter</strong> once we get back. Everything adds up, and we'll be more than happy to recognise your contribution.</li>
<li>For £25 or more, we'll send you a high-quality A4 <strong>signed print</strong> of one of the best photos we take on the expedition plus a thank-you letter.</li>
<li>For £50 or more, we'll take a photo of the team holding a <strong>message of your choice</strong>, dangling from a cliff, on the summit of a mountain or from the deck of the boat - you decide. We'll then send you a signed print of it, plus a thank-you letter and a <strong>copy of our film</strong> on DVD.</li>
<li>For £500 or more, you'll get all of the above, plus a different kind of reward.<span> Traditionally, the first ascentionists of a route or unnamed mountain have the right to name it.</span> We'll let you <strong>choose the name for a route </strong>that we make a first ascent of, to go down in the global records of the climbing community. There are a couple of constraints on this - no rude names for instance - so send us an email with your ideas before buying into this.</li>
<li>For £750 or more, you get the complete corporate <strong>sponsorship package</strong> - promotional material, tailored articles/gear reviews, videos, logo promotion, mentions in all blogs and articles, mention in the short film, etc.</li>
</ul><p>Of course, any and all contributions are met with our heartfelt thanks.</p>

<p>Nobody looked cooler than the kids at the skate park with their BMX bikes, pulling wheelies and somehow defying the laws of gravity. You saved up for months doing chores to get a bike of your own, just to be admitted as a part of the BMX family. Whether you were one of the kids with the skills to race or you just enjoyed the feel of the fresh air on your face as you sped down the block, Bicycle Motorcross was a cherished part of your youth.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Rising in popularity during the 1970s and 80s, the BMX bike became a symbol of freedom for youth both in the United States and around the world. As years passed, the tricks associated with Bicycle Motorcross became less of a hobby than a sport that involved dedicated skill, relentless practice, the possibility of severe dangers, yet so much opportunity. Stores filled up with BMX gear and professional teams competed to crowds of worshiping fans.                          </p>

A scaled down version of an old school BMX seat clamp. Custom machined in the USA.

 

 
Nobody looked cooler than the kids at the skate park with their BMX bikes, pulling wheelies and somehow defying the laws of gravity. You saved up for months doing chores to get a bike of your own, just to be admitted as a part of the BMX family. Whether you were one of the kids with the skills to race or you just enjoyed the feel of the fresh air on your face as you sped down the block, Bicycle Motorcross was a cherished part of your youth.

 
Rising in popularity during the 1970s and 80s, the BMX bike became a symbol of freedom for youth both in the United States and around the world. As years passed, the tricks associated with Bicycle Motorcross became less of a hobby than a sport that involved dedicated skill, relentless practice, the possibility of severe dangers, yet so much opportunity. Stores filled up with BMX gear and professional teams competed to crowds of worshiping fans.                          
                                                                                                                                                                       
We may no longer have that treasured bike sitting in our garage waiting for our next adventure.  But a craftsman with a small one-person shop in Northern California has designed the ability to take those memories with us with his miniaturized replica of the Seat Post Clamp.

 
This seat post replica, made from aircraft grade aluminum can be carried with you every day as a keychain or left as a symbol of your childhood on your desk. It’s a practical, functional, and marvelous design that allows us to continue to let our childhood memories spark curiosity and adventure in our adult lives.

 
 
Room for two standard sized keys

<p>Nature Lovers Montenegro is an NGO established with the aim to share our passion and love for nature and authentic adventures with the world. Our team is small but made of people with years of experience in organizing and conducting adventure and extreme expeditions, camps and rafting and kayak courses all around Europe and the world. For more than 10 years we are actively organizing individual and group excursions for people to get in touch with nature and feel as a part of it. Last year we created the first ever Kayak Festival in Montenegro – Kayak Fest Tara 2016. Also, 2 years in a row we've been a part of Balkan Rivers Tour action, the biggest movement for protection of free flowing rivers in Europe.</p>
<p>Whitewater kayak fest Tara was held for the first time in Montenegro last September, organized by Nature Lovers Montenegro in collab with Camp Grab. Main goal of the festival was to promote kayaking as an amazing sport, especially because Montenegro has so much to offer in that matter – there are few big rivers to paddle with over 15 sections of class 1-5 whitewater, rivers are wild and pristine, and for some of them days of free flow are going to end soon – dams are planned to be built and these are some of the last days to feel their immense power, strength and freedom - IF we don't accomplish to stop the damnation.</p>
<p>The problem with kayaking in Montenegro is that it is so hard to get support from sponsors, since there are just a few active kayakers and kayak as a sport doesn’t get the attention it deserves, even though Montenegro is an amazing paradise for kayakers of all levels! However, our goal is clear – we want to show the world what a free flowing river is and to make this a true hotspot for kayakers worldwide, as well as to wake up our sleepy citizens. In order to do that we need your help! Every little bit helps, a small donation, such as what you would give for a coffee or a beer, would help us reach our goal!</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this goal, right now we will need 3500$. The funds will be invested in building a ramp for the race part of the Fest, purchasing and installing equipment for the race, services of recording and video production, river safety and time tracking services.</p>
<p>The first edition of Kayak festival was a blast! About 50 kayakers from all over the world (Montenegro, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Germany, Ireland etc.) were paddling for four days, taking part in different kinds of races – from slalom to down river and boater cross. The race was open to kayakers of all levels, from beginner to advanced level. Beside the kayakers, around 300 people from Montenegro and the region attended the fest just to enjoy watching the race and dance on the parties.</p>
<p>Kayak fest vol. 2 will take place from September 22-25. Ticket price for all days of the festival is 50 euros and includes accommodation in tents, full board and festival ticket.</p>
<p> Kayak fest has something for everyone – if you're not a kayaker, you can enjoy themed parties, music on the beach, cheer the kayakers while drinking ice cold beer and enjoying warm mountain sun, take photographs of the impressive nature, write blogs in hammocks above the river, go hike nearby hills or even go rafting. Opportunities are numerous!</p>
<p>If you can't make a donation, we kindly ask you to get the word out and make some noise by sharing this post on you social media, as well as on your other channels. It will mean a lot to us!</p>
</div></div>","Nature Lovers Montenegro is an NGO established with the aim to share our passion and love for nature and authentic adventures with the world. Our team is small but made of people with years of experience in organizing and conducting adventure and extreme expeditions, camps and rafting and kayak courses all around Europe and the world. For more than 10 years we are actively organizing individual and group excursions for people to get in touch with nature and feel as a part of it. Last year we created the first ever Kayak Festival in Montenegro – Kayak Fest Tara 2016. Also, 2 years in a row we've been a part of Balkan Rivers Tour action, the biggest movement for protection of free flowing rivers in Europe.
Whitewater kayak fest Tara was held for the first time in Montenegro last September, organized by Nature Lovers Montenegro in collab with Camp Grab. Main goal of the festival was to promote kayaking as an amazing sport, especially because Montenegro has so much to offer in that matter – there are few big rivers to paddle with over 15 sections of class 1-5 whitewater, rivers are wild and pristine, and for some of them days of free flow are going to end soon – dams are planned to be built and these are some of the last days to feel their immense power, strength and freedom - IF we don't accomplish to stop the damnation.
The problem with kayaking in Montenegro is that it is so hard to get support from sponsors, since there are just a few active kayakers and kayak as a sport doesn’t get the attention it deserves, even though Montenegro is an amazing paradise for kayakers of all levels! However, our goal is clear – we want to show the world what a free flowing river is and to make this a true hotspot for kayakers worldwide, as well as to wake up our sleepy citizens. In order to do that we need your help! Every little bit helps, a small donation, such as what you would give for a coffee or a beer, would help us reach our goal!
In order to accomplish this goal, right now we will need 3500$. The funds will be invested in building a ramp for the race part of the Fest, purchasing and installing equipment for the race, services of recording and video production, river safety and time tracking services.

Spearfishing has been unchanged for the last 60 years with the standard becoming wooden sticks with rubber bands. With many sports enjoying technological advancements such as football (sticky gloves), golf (new club alloys), and swimming (reduced drag suits), it seemed that it was time for spearfishing to catchup. The MK1 was created to help bring the tech that surrounds us everyday into the aquatic environment. </p><h2>HOW: The MK1 Speargun.</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615572489/bmzydgvyv98ickdvzjca.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Equipped with an accessory rail, the MK1 can be fitted with anything ranging from laser and lights to cameras and fish reels.

Spearfishing has been unchanged for the last 60 years with the standard becoming wooden sticks with rubber bands.

The MK1 was created to help bring the tech that surrounds us everyday into the aquatic environment. HOW: The MK1 Speargun.Equipped with an accessory rail, the MK1 can be fitted with anything ranging from laser and lights to cameras and fish reels.

<p>The design process was one of the most enjoyable parts of the whole project. We had three goals in mind from the beginning: simplicity, durability, and innovation. And if our prototype didn't meet all three, we started from the ground up. We made a new one until it was perfect.</p>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<p>Some say “more is better.” We have a different mindset at Modern-Day Caveman. When designing a product we see what's out there and ask ourselves, how can we make this simpler without compromising performance? We want everyone, from child to senior, beginner to expert, to have an enjoyable, hassle-free experience with our gear.</p>
<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>Selling survival equipment comes with significant responsibility; our customers trust their safety on our products, and we don’t take that lightly. For that reason, we use the best materials and manufacturing practices we can get our hands on. We do rigorous testing for worst-case scenarios and make sure our products will perform under any situation our future users might encounter. </p>
<h3>Innovation</h3>
<p>We excel under pressure. We explore new waters because that's where real change comes from. We create new solutions to age-old problems, and the only way to do that successfully is to think differently.</p>

<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>As a designer who travels a lot for projects all over the world, traveling was always a necessity to my daily life. Some travels were further than others and always had my travel pillows (the ones you find at the terminal) with me to ensure that I had some form of pillow when I needed one.</p>
<p>However, I found that they often did not offer the support nor breathability to ensure I wasn’t having neck pains or transpiring and ended up more than once with a stiff neck and shoulder pains.</p>
<p>For these reasons exactly, I was set on finding a solution to these issues which arose by uncomfortable prolonged sitting.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515169224/ccefbmyz7dqs6yuo94dw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The pillow had to fit and feel comfy for the large majority of people wearing it and offer enough support so that it would actually be a neck pillow instead of a flat round design that has been around for ages. It would offer enough support for my shoulders and the neck muscles on the side, back and front, (trapezius muscles, sternocleidomastoid muscles &amp; longus colli/capitus muscles, thanks Google) to be able to relax. The pillow would also have to be able to allow for some form of air flowing through as waking up sweaty is the worst but at the same time keep your body snug and warm. And there had to be an adjustable strap to be able to allow adjusting the support you were going to be needing.</p>

<p><strong> 2.             Poor Breathing</strong></p>
<p> The only way for you to breathe “optimally” is when the diaphragm and rib cage are able to fully expand. This is true while seated but even more so when doing physical activity.

<p>""Shallow breathing limits the diaphragm’s range of motion. The lowest part of the lungs doesn’t get a full share of oxygenated air. That can make you feel short of breath and anxious. Deep abdominal breathing encourages full oxygen exchange — that is, the beneficial trade of incoming oxygen for outgoing carbon dioxide. Not surprisingly, it can slow the heartbeat and lower or stabilize blood pressure.</p>

<p><strong>3.              Amplify Depression, Stress &amp; Tension Headaches</strong></p>
<p>When you’re feeling down or having a bad day, something that really wouldn't help fix it is sitting in a bad position. Slouching actually constricts and compresses your body which forces your heart to pump harder in order to circulate blood and this will, in turn, decrease your energy level which, in turn, may make you start feeling tired, irritated and aggravated. Another side effect is tension headaches which have much in common with migraines but on a different level which are common among desk job employees.</p>
<p>“This study and the earlier findings that exercise by itself can significantly reduce depression suggest that energy levels and depression are modulated not only by cognitions but also by body posture and movements. Thus the mind-body relationship is a two-way street: mind to body and body to mind. We strongly recommend that therapists, teachers, and clients include body posture and movement as an additional healing strategy to increase energy and enhance health.</p>

<li>
<p>Cover shipping and handling costs</p>
</li>
</ul><p> <br/><strong>Who are we? </strong></p>
<p>We are a group of Northwestern students who are tired of seeing bikes disappear from campus and watching bike owners saw off rusty old locks when they lose their keys. When we (Joppe Bijlsma, A.K. Singh, and Zeina Abou-Said) first arrived at the Kellogg School of Management last summer we became friends with Fabio, an international student from Brazil. He had just bought a brand new bike, but it was stolen within just a few hours of parking his bike on campus. Over a million bicycles like Fabio’s are stolen every year, yet bike locks have not changed much since their inception over 40 years ago. We thought there must be something we could do to solve this problem. We pitched the concept of HaamLock in a startup competition on campus in October and ranked among the top teams. Through the competition we were granted access into Northwestern’s innovative NUvention Web program, a class in which students build and launch a business or product. That’s where we met Shaker, Mengyuan and Patrick - the rest of the HaamLock team. We then pitched in Kellogg’s 2013 Shark Tank competition and once again wowed the audience with our product.

<p> </p></div>","Thanks for stopping by! We are excited to bring you HaamLock, the smarter bike lock. 
So, what is HaamLock exactly? 
HaamLock is a high tech bike lock 


Lock and unlock it with your cell phone 



Use it to find the safest spot to park your bike* 



Find your bike on a map if you forget where you left it 



Protect your bike with HaamLock’s sturdier mechanical design 



Easily notify your friends in the unfortunate event that your bike is stolen



Charge it via a mini USB port 

 * Currently only available in Chicago, we will add additional city bike theft data if we receive 50 backers or more in a given region 
And what do we need these funds for? 
Have you ever had to break into your own bike lock because you broke or lost your keys? Our dream is to take this product from prototype to the streets of  your city and allow cyclists all across the world to ditch their keys and embrace a simpler way to secure their bicycles. We have successfully built two working prototypes of our lock. We have also completed our iPhone app.
Our next step is to produce a first batch of the locks. This is where you come in, we need your help to: 


Take the product from prototype to street ready 



Cover material costs such as metal and electronic components 



Set up production and assembly at a local manufacturer 



Cover shipping and handling costs

 Who are we? 
We are a group of Northwestern students who are tired of seeing bikes disappear from campus and watching bike owners saw off rusty old locks when they lose their keys. When we (Joppe Bijlsma, A.K. Singh, and Zeina Abou-Said) first arrived at the Kellogg School of Management last summer we became friends with Fabio, an international student from Brazil. He had just bought a brand new bike, but it was stolen within just a few hours of parking his bike on campus. Over a million bicycles like Fabio’s are stolen every year, yet bike locks have not changed much since their inception over 40 years ago. We thought there must be something we could do to solve this problem. We pitched the concept of HaamLock in a startup competition on campus in October and ranked among the top teams. Through the competition we were granted access into Northwestern’s innovative NUvention Web program, a class in which students build and launch a business or product. That’s where we met Shaker, Mengyuan and Patrick - the rest of the HaamLock team. We then pitched in Kellogg’s 2013 Shark Tank competition and once again wowed the audience with our product.

We will do anything we can to make sure that this exchange leaves with good vibes for everyone involved. Risks and challengesAs we at Gobi Gear know all too well, manufacturing comes with its own set of headaches, whether they be from the fabric mill, an agent you trusted, or just hitting Chinese New Year all wrong in the production cycle.The good news is that we have learned more than a thing or two, and this time, we are heading in prepared. We already have sourced and specified every single part of these backpacks, and have verified that the colors we are offering here are 100% available. We have also already held the spot at the factory to produce these bags ASAP.But what about the Trump Tariffs? As you all may also know, President Trump is talking about more tariffs on goods coming out of China. China is where our products are lovingly made - and we have a wonderful relationship with our factory. Rather than run to another country, we are sticking with what works, and hope you'll understand the price being slightly higher than it would have been a year ago.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p align=""center""><strong>The Dawn of Laser Powered Flight</strong></p>
<p>The KC Space Pirates are planning on keeping a AR Drone quad copter flying for 48 hours to demonstrate the potential of Laser Powered Flight and wireless power beaming. The KC Space Pirates are best known for our participation in the NASA Power Beaming Challenge pursuing a $2,000,000 prize purse. We are a 3 time top finisher and walked away with $90,000 in consolation prize money. We brought innovation, professionalism, and gumption to the Space Elevator games. In response to this refreshing attitude about science and space technology we were heavily covered by the press. Our workshop appeared on the cover of the New York Times Magazine. Our captain was interviewed on Late Night with Conan O’Brien.</p>
<p>Wireless power beaming is in it's infancy. Lasers are getting more powerful and cheaper at an exponential rate. For power beaming to make a difference in the lives of everyone it needs to prove itself. And not just in some highly funded military or government lab. We intend to short-cut years of secret development of military applications and focus on what it can do for the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We have a lot of equipment from the Space Elevator Games and have gotten our core sponsors (TRUMPF, ThorLabs and National Instruments) to help us out in this new project, so we are a long ways toward our goal. But as usual it's the details that eat you alive. If this whole project ends up on our credit cards like a big chunk of the power beaming competition did, we just won't be able to continue.</p>
<p>So this campaign is to see if crowd funding cutting edge power beaming demonstrations is viable. If we can get the core expenses covered by flagship sponsors and the numerous smaller items covered by people like you we can continue to advance the state of the art and make power beaming a practical way to solve our power problems in the future.</p>
<p>We need your money to help us buy the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a good DVR system to record the record and help broadcast it to the internet for everyone to see.</li>
<li>We have to have a professional ustream account.</li>
<li>We need to buy more quadcopter hardware so that it will be fresh for the record attempt.</li>
<li>We need to pay a guard for the overnight portions of the record for venue security requirements.</li>
<li>We need lots of safety equipment to scale this up from our small garage based lab to the large exhibit hall where we will do the record.</li>
<li>We also have to get the cells cut for the final photovoltaic panel.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We have arranged for some commemorative memorabilia and a few more solid perks. I hope you can find something you like. You can also contribute without choosing a perk so don’t sweat it.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong></p>
<p>Wireless power Beaming has many applications from mundane to fantastically grand. From keeping your dogs GPS locater charged to powering the Space Elevator. From delivering mail and pizza to delivering power from orbit to earth in Space Based Solar Power(SBS). All these applications have challenges to their practicality and need technology to develop before we will see them making our lives better. But keeping a quadcopter flying has reached the practicality threshold where a demo can help show the world that Power Beaming Prime Time will happen in our lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Power Beaming as Alternative Energy</strong></p>
<p>Currently the efficiency of power beaming is low enough that it lacks credibility as “Alternative” energy however laser tech is currently improving at a rate reminiscent of Moore’s law. So we are only a few years from wireless power beaming having alternative energy credibility. The low cost lasers are entering the scene today and the custom photovoltaics have been basically waiting for lasers. Our end to end efficiency is predicted to be 5 to 7% using mostly off the shelf components. Custom components jump that to 30% with improvements passing the 50% mark not far off.</p>
<p>We can use power beaming to reduce or replace fossil fuels in aircraft. Electric aircraft are coming of age with realistic ranges and performance levels. Power beaming can allow these aircraft to match their fossil fueled bretheren.</p>
<p>Hybrid aircraft is another area of interest to the KC Space Pirates. We estimate that 1/4 to 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the fuel needed to power a 777 cargo plane at cruise could be provided by power beaming from mid levels orbiting satellites.</p>
<p><strong>Tounge in Cheek</strong></p>
<p>You might have noticed we are a bit tounge in cheek around here. We want science and technology to be fun and approachable. Not just for us but for future generations as well.</p>

<p><strong>Now Is The Time!</strong></p>
<p>Industry is waiting for the government to show power beaming is ready. The government is waiting for the military. We’re waiting for no one! Well, actually, we are waiting for you to pick out a perk and show that the world wants new tech to make it a better place.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>All the KC Space Pirate crew has day jobs. It takes a constant bubbling of effort by our supporters to keep this going. We need help managing the social media and getting the word out.

<p>We are
Giovanni, Ulgar and Nicolas. Our story starts while Giovanni was living in
Brazil. That's right, the hot tropical country hosting the World Cup right now.</p>
<p>While searching
for alternatives to traditional deodorants which just kept him fresh for a few
hours, he found a solution in a mixture of natural plants and herbs commonly used
in hottest northern regions of Brazil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When he returned to Belgium, he teamed up with Ulgar Bilican and
founded 24SEVEN. The two went to work perfecting the formula, and making it
available in the marketplace. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They continued improving the formula, so that it not only provided
long lasting odor elimination; but would keep armpits 100% dry and shirts
clean. </p>
<p>Throughout their 3 years of testing the team perfectionized the
product and achieved amazing test results which proven the product to <b>neutralize odor for over 24hrs in a row</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That was just
the beginning. Using Giovanni's experience as a chemical engineer and Ulgar's
retail business knowledge, they searched for a solution which would also absorb
armpit sweat AND neutralize bacteria at the same time.</p>

<h3>What is TACK?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535592281/ciy7rrkypg3ibtrkcn3v.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>TACK is an acronym for Titanium Anywhere Card Knife which was created using our minimalist design philosophy.      </p>
<p>There's a lot of credit card type tools out there, that just don't ""cut it"".  We knew that we could make something much better, which also happened to look good at the same time.  So we put our heads together and came up with TACK.  The end result was a tool that just simply made sense once you held it in your hand. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535596533/wpubks4maxycpej9rqxf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>(Wallet Not Included - Size Reference Only)</i></p>
<p>Our goal was to design TACK to be as thin and light as possible, without compromising structural integrity.  We wanted to make TACK practical and functional, while being suitable for every day carry.  So we made it similar in size to a credit card, which would conveniently fit in your wallet!</p>
<p>*One of the unintended benefits of TACK is that it may also block RFID readers or scammers from skimming your credit card info from your wallet, if placed correctly next to your credit card stripe. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>About TACK:</h2>
<h3><i>Design:</i></h3>
<p>In keeping with our minimalist design principle, we integrated many of its  features within the structural frame of TACK.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535592434/zxbacnhmmezfnvkvdcih.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>TACK is designed and made in the USA from grade 5 titanium (6AL-4V).  We chose titanium because it's ultra lightweight, twice as strong as steel, anti-corrosive, and rust proof.  You could actually leave TACK at the bottom of the ocean floor for 100 years and it would look the same as it did on the day you left it there!  Due to the the many benefits of titanium, it is commonly used in the aerospace, military, and medical industries.  It was the perfect choice of materials for something that was going to live in your wallet.</p>
<h3><i>Finish:</i></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535592481/ecow4asx1nvcjexc5y7x.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Why TACK?</h3>
<p>Our goal when creating TACK was to design the absolute highest quality,  wallet sized utility tool anywhere.  We chose the latest in material technology, which would not only be aesthetically pleasing, but most importantly practical and functional. No Origami skills required to use and no cheap plastic parts to break.  Not only is TACK great for EDC, but you can also  take it fishing, camping, scuba diving, or even up Mt. Everest.  This is one solid piece of military grade titanium, which can withstand any environment you throw at it.     </p>

<p>TACK is designed with safety in mind.  We've integrated our Secure Grip Retention (SGR) system, which is a finger guard that prevents your hand and fingers from slipping on to the sharp blade when being used.  Our three finger design allows you to control TACK more accurately by reducing side to side movement when gripped. </p>

<p>Traditional bags have hard, skinny wheels, like a road bike; and you wouldn’t take a road bike down an off-road trail.
        More like a mountain bike, Trailpod takes rough terrain in its stride.</p>
<p>Trailpod uses our patented <b><a href=""http://www.handiworld.com/handimoova-63/handimoova.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Camba wheel technology</a></b> which allows Trailpod to effortlessly carry your heavy gear
        over uneven ground.</p>
<p>Camba's novel suspension combines a hemispherical wheel with a ‘floating’ independent axle system. The large footprint
        of the hemi-spherical wheel spreads the load so they don’t sink or dig into soft surfaces. The floating axle allows
        the wheel to overcome obstacles that smaller fixed axles fail to manage.</p>
<p>Trailpod has three big wheels so it’s always stable and rolling whatever the obstacle. Nobody enjoys the experience of
        dragging a reluctant two-wheeled bag as it falls over onto its side and grinds to a halt; Trailpod is <i>always</i>        the right way up.</p>
<p>The pull handle is free to rotate, meaning no more awkward wrist strain caused by unstable two-wheeled bags with stiff,
        un-ergonomic handles.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444216935/hdsj2mf0jdbsm4ffvmbr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>(Photograph of prototype.

<h3></h3><h3>FAQ: Prototype in the video:</h3><p>We built a prototype Trailpod to test the ergonomics and bag design, and to film for the campaign video so the final product will look slightly different to this prototype.</p><p>In particular, the wheels in the production Trailpod will be made of heavy-duty rubber with off-road tread. We’ll post pictures as soon as we have updates to show you.</p><h3>FAQ: Modular bag system - new or different bags: 
    </h3><p> Our unique modular bag system allows different bags and accessories to be attached to Trailpod's frame. We are offering
        Trailpod with our general purpose insulated storage compartment, and a removable bag with multiple zipped pockets
        and adjustable netting. It’s our plan to offer indiegogo pledgees a special discount on any subsequent bag designs
        we release, once we’ve reached our target and the perks have been fulfilled. In time we aim to release further complementary
        bag designs; one variant will be a single removable liner that fits the whole interior.
    </p>
<h3>FAQ: Will there be other colours? </h3>
<p><b>In short, watch this space.</b></p>
<p> We picked a universal colour scheme for this indiegogo launch which we hope covers a broad range of tastes. With sufficient
        demand during this campaign, we are hoping to offer alternative fabric bag accent colours but this will rely on minimum
        order quantities being achieved. </p>
<p> We are working with our fabrics manufacturer to find different coloured materials which will not impact our delivery
        schedule, which we hope to include as stretch goals if we meet our funding target.</p>
<p>We cannot offer different colour frames for Trailpod at this stage but this is one of our longer term aims.</p>
<h3>FAQ:  How weatherproof is it? </h3>
<p> You can wheel Trailpod through wet grass and sand, just don't take it swimming! </p>
<p>We will be using fabrics for the bags that can withstand the rigors of the outdoors.</p><p> The bottom of the bag is a plastic coated fabric and is waterproof so you won’t have to worry too much about rolling
        through puddles and mud.
    </p>
<p> Trailpod uses water resistant zippers throughout, which repel rain but are not completely waterproof. The main bag fabric
        will bead water in the rain, but will retain moisture after a while. A water resistant lining on the inside of the
        bag serves to protect your stuff.</p>

<p>This project is dedicated to special kind of people who are really into DIY concept. And we have to admit, that it is not easy to reach them.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are asking everybody to share this at local drone sites, on your mother tongue, as we want to get in touch with DIY enthusiasts from all over the world!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our team has been working for over a year on Xcompact and developed the key parts for the project. We know what will be the next steps towards
series production. We have our suppliers and partners waiting and
ready to start the production process.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, we know that life is not always fully predictable and there
might be unforeseen troubles waiting for us on the road to mass production.</p>
<p>The main challenges are:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Firstly, we need to reach minimum order quantity. Without that we
can't start manufacturing. We hope we can get the minimal amount of orders to
successfully start our company. We believe in our product and we have no doubt
that it will be a step towards the future of drones.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Secondly, we need to ensure high quality of our products. We are planning to take counsel from professionals in order to find trustful suppliers. In mass production some percent of defective parts is unavoidable, so we are going to ship all components to Germany and check them personally before sending to you. </p>

</div></div>","Ever dreamed of a truly portable drone?
Mid-sized and larger drones have many advantages over their smaller brothers: longer flight times, higher payloads (better/bigger cameras, extra battery, etc.), higher wind resistance.
However, larger drones bring problems with transportation. Probably, each drone owner thought about an easier way to carry his copter. So our team has developed a brand-new option. Meet the Xcompact!





How does it work
This project follows the concept of famous LEGO© toys, when from a fixed set of parts you can make almost everything. We picked a set of ""bricks"" which allows you to build a rich variety of drones. Along with standard parts we have designed custom, multifunctional components to make the models flexible and ultraportable.





Same parts - 3 Kits - Different purposes

Model S


This is a 400 class frame, designed for 8-9 inch propellers. 

Will work perfectly with GoPro©. 


By using an upgrade kit you can extend the antivibration module to 3 levels (one appears below core tubes). This allows you to attach the battery to the antivibration module at the bottom increasing the damping efficiency.



Model M



With size up to 610 mm, this frame flies with 10-14 inch propellers. 

Capable of carrying a mirrorless camera. 

With an upgrade kit you can add a support module at the middle of the core tubes. This would prevent the antivibration module from bending (in case of heavy loads) and bring an option for retractable landing gear.  



Model L


This frame can reach 800 mm and fits for 15-18 inch propellers. 
Will easily lift a mirrorless camera and capable of carrying a DSLR. 

An upgrade kit will extend the antivibration module adding extra battery space for longer flight times.   



Who will like the Xcompact

Beginners: Our frames feature simple and intuitive assembly process. With ultimate flexibility of Xcompact you learn by trying different set-ups. Therefore, for your first project our platform will be the best option. Don't struggle with a painful choice any more! 

Amateurs: Already familiar with DIY multirotors? Then you would appreciate the portability of Xcompact, which saves your space making your hobby more joyful.

Other ways you can help
Feel free to write us your ideas about our design or the project itself. We will be glad to hear your opinion and suggestions. Don't hesitate to ask questions, we are happy to give you an answer and will create FAQ following your inquiries.Follow us in your favorite networks and share our progress among your friends.
This project is dedicated to special kind of people who are really into DIY concept. And we have to admit, that it is not easy to reach them.
Therefore, we are asking everybody to share this at local drone sites, on your mother tongue, as we want to get in touch with DIY enthusiasts from all over the world!

Risks & Challenges
Our team has been working for over a year on Xcompact and developed the key parts for the project. We know what will be the next steps towards
series production. We have our suppliers and partners waiting and
ready to start the production process.
However, we know that life is not always fully predictable and there
might be unforeseen troubles waiting for us on the road to mass production.
The main challenges are:
Firstly, we need to reach minimum order quantity. Without that we
can't start manufacturing. We hope we can get the minimal amount of orders to
successfully start our company. We believe in our product and we have no doubt
that it will be a step towards the future of drones.
Secondly, we need to ensure high quality of our products. We are planning to take counsel from professionals in order to find trustful suppliers. In mass production some percent of defective parts is unavoidable, so we are going to ship all components to Germany and check them personally before sending to you.

Winter is a perfect time for planning your future flights, start today with Xcompact!



After the complete system testing we are going to present a detailed report. Moreover we will offer power packs (motors, ESC, etc.) for our frames. We expect at least 15% bulk discounts from our partners (currently Emax). These power packs are not offered here because the obligatory fees would lessen your profit. 
The Team




We are an international team that gathered expertise to bring this project to life. Our goal is to deliver an innovative and high-quality product to the community of drone enthusiasts.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Let’s explain some key terms we are using</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What is a  co-working retreat?</strong></h3>
<p>One of the coolest things is participants don’t have to take time off work to attend our retreats, work can come along too, hence remote workers and ‘co-working’.<br/>We are planning to have monthly retreats in 2019:</p>

<h3><strong>What is a Digital Nomad?</strong></h3>
<p>Over the last decade there has been a global shift to virtual offices and teams that has created a spike in growth of the ‘remote worker’. From this ‘remote worker’ a paradigm shift has occurred whereby the ‘digital nomad’ has evolved.</p>

<p>Wigl is an <b>interactive educational robot</b> with a <b>musical</b> ear. </p>
<p><span>Wigl hears notes (from any instrument)
and responds with real-world movements, lights, and special dances! Kids, and adults, are motivated to practice their instrument. </span></p>
<p>Through sequenced musical notes, you
can program special dance moves for Wigl! The combination of <b>right brain
creativity</b> with <b>left brain logic</b> makes this a unique robot for any family!</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/974819/files/20141031114048-3_IGG_play_V1.png?1414780848"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h1><b><span>How does Wigl work?</span></b></h1><div>
<p>Wigl has a microphone, a microcontroller (brain), and some motors for movement. Wigl is ALWAYS listening for musical notes, and through some complex math, it can hear individual music notes. There are two (2) modes built into Wigl:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>(1) Auto Mode</b></p>
<p>When Wigl hears a musical note that it knows, it moves and lights up! Specific notes make Wigl move in specific ways. For example, an A might move Wigl forward, while a D could move Wigl backward. If you play a series of notes together to form a song, Wigl celebrates with a special dance!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/975056/files/20141031124330-4_IGG_movements_missing_bottom_hole.png?1414784610"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b>(2) Programming Mode</b><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Instead of Wigl <i>moving </i>once it hears a note, it <i>stays still</i> and stores it in its memory. Every note played is memorized, like lines of code in a computer program. Then, to run your Wigl program, you play a special ""ENTER"" note, and watch Wigl go!  </p>
<p>This is a fun way to problem solve (e.g. Wigl'ing out of a maze) and teach kids the basics of coding: notes as pseudo-code! </p>
<br/>
</div><h1><b><span>Wigl is born</span></b></h1>
<p>My 3rd grade music teacher gave me my
first musical instrument, the recorder. Learning to play clean notes,
practicing mundane songs... none of this was fun. Plus it was frustrating since
I had to practice in a room, by myself. <b>I wished I had a musical buddy</b> that
would enjoy my attempts, and dance to my music.</p>
<p>Flash forward 20 years later, and I
still have that same desire (now with the ukulele). But this time, Wigl was
there to help me out. If I didn't play a note correctly, Wigl wouldn't move. This motivation to see Wigl dance around <b>kept me practicing</b>, and even led me to learn songs!</p>
<p><span>After the first prototype was built in July 2013, we started testing the unit with the Renaissance School
in Portland, OR. The kids loved the robot, but it didn't have a name (or a
face) yet. </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/978390/files/20141101201022-8_IGG_evolution_blue.png?1414897822"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>With the help of some wonderful designers, we began implementing the kids' input and creating the outer form that you see today. From sketch, to clay mold, to 3D print, Wigl was born!<div>
<br/><p>The past <b>16 months</b> have been spent <b>testing Wigl with hundreds of children and parents</b> at local schools, museums, and children's events. We've taken all of that feedback and input and invented what we believe is a truly unique learning experience.</p>

<br/><h1><b>Let's make little engineers</b></h1>
<p>I'm an engineer, and I can see that there is a worldwide shortage of quality engineers. People seem to believe that strong Math skills are the most important prerequisite for being an engineer. However, I think that <b>creative problem solving</b> is far more important, and is really the foundation of Engineering. With Wigl, we can develop this skill and <b>get kids excited about Engineering</b>!</p>

<br/><h1><b>Think outside the tablet</b></h1>
<p>Today's robots for children require a separate screen interface (e.g. computer,

<h1><b><span>How will your funds help?</span></b></h1>
<p><span>Our team has gone through five (5) different iterations to bring you the version that you see today. Each of these iterations included additional features/functionality that parents and children helped us identify. We've crossed major hurdles in note recognition, noise cancellation, and even majorly altered the internal components to bring the cost down.</span></p>
<p><span>With this current prototype, we are at the final hurdle. And we need your help to get Wigl out to children everywhere! </span></p>
<p><span>Your funds will be used to cover the costs of production-quality plastics, professional PCB (printed circuit board) design, and improved functionality. We will be working with wonderfully talented Industrial Designers to prepare Wigl for mass production, and a quality Electronics Manufacturing to ensure high reliability circuitry!</span></p>
<p>Most of all, your donation will help us <b>create a new type of educational robot</b>. One that explores the creativity of children, without requiring a separate smart device / screen for control. <br/></p>

<br/><h1><span><b><span>About Wigl's Creator</span></b></span></h1>
<p><span>Hi! I'm Vivek Mano, the creator
of Wigl. I'm an Electrical Engineer from the University of Florida.  While at UF, I created my first robot, an autonomous tennis-ball retrieving robot. Since then, I've had fun building various other hobby robots.</span></p>
<p><span>For the past 8 years, I have been involved in Sales, Marketing, and
Business Development within the Industrial Automation industry (big robots).
But my background, and my passion, is in embedded electronics and robotics
(smaller robots). Being able to combine both experiences is what led to Wigl.</span></p>

<h1><b>Risks and
Challenges</b></h1>
<p><b>Manufacturing</b></p>
<p>Creating the plastics tool (mold) takes anywhere from 20-30 weeks to be built. There is also a risk that first series articles will have slight abnormalities that need to be fixed. By using local manufacturing for both plastics and electronics, we will minimize those risks! </p>
<p><b>Ambient noise</b></p>
<p>Since Wigl listens to everything, it's best used in a quiet environment. Having a TV on in the background, or in a group setting with people talking, causes Wigl to ""hear"" non-musical notes. Just like most sound-recognition devices (e.g. Siri), the quality of sound is paramount. </p>
<p>We'll be working hard to minimize that through creative software and circuit designs. My Electrical Engineering background will come in handy! </p>

Wigl is an interactive educational robot with a musical ear. 
Wigl hears notes (from any instrument)
and responds with real-world movements, lights, and special dances! Kids, and adults, are motivated to practice their instrument. 
Through sequenced musical notes, you
can program special dance moves for Wigl! The combination of right brain
creativity with left brain logic makes this a unique robot for any family!
How does Wigl work?
Wigl has a microphone, a microcontroller (brain), and some motors for movement. Wigl is ALWAYS listening for musical notes, and through some complex math, it can hear individual music notes. There are two (2) modes built into Wigl:
(1) Auto Mode
When Wigl hears a musical note that it knows, it moves and lights up! Specific notes make Wigl move in specific ways. For example, an A might move Wigl forward, while a D could move Wigl backward. If you play a series of notes together to form a song, Wigl celebrates with a special dance!

(2) Programming Mode
Instead of Wigl moving once it hears a note, it stays still and stores it in its memory. Every note played is memorized, like lines of code in a computer program. Then, to run your Wigl program, you play a special ""ENTER"" note, and watch Wigl go!  
This is a fun way to problem solve (e.g. Wigl'ing out of a maze) and teach kids the basics of coding: notes as pseudo-code! 

Wigl is born
My 3rd grade music teacher gave me my
first musical instrument, the recorder. Learning to play clean notes,
practicing mundane songs... none of this was fun. Plus it was frustrating since
I had to practice in a room, by myself. I wished I had a musical buddy that
would enjoy my attempts, and dance to my music.
Flash forward 20 years later, and I
still have that same desire (now with the ukulele). But this time, Wigl was
there to help me out. If I didn't play a note correctly, Wigl wouldn't move. This motivation to see Wigl dance around kept me practicing, and even led me to learn songs!
After the first prototype was built in July 2013, we started testing the unit with the Renaissance School
in Portland, OR. The kids loved the robot, but it didn't have a name (or a
face) yet. 
With the help of some wonderful designers, we began implementing the kids' input and creating the outer form that you see today. From sketch, to clay mold, to 3D print, Wigl was born!
The past 16 months have been spent testing Wigl with hundreds of children and parents at local schools, museums, and children's events. We've taken all of that feedback and input and invented what we believe is a truly unique learning experience.





In November 2013, we entered Wigl into the Oregon Technology Business Center's (OTBC) Electronic Systems Pitch competition and were awarded the grand prize for our technology approach and business model.


A few months later, in March 2014, we entered Robohub / SV Robo's international Robot Launch 2014 competition and won two awards. The first was the ""Crowd Pleaser"", awarded by Indiegogo, for having the best chance of going viral. The second was the ""Leanest Startup"" award for frugal use of funds and updating Wigl through continuous customer feedback. 


The positive reception, both from the kids and the startup community, has given us the confidence to bring Wigl to classrooms and homes everywhere.


Let's make little engineers
I'm an engineer, and I can see that there is a worldwide shortage of quality engineers. People seem to believe that strong Math skills are the most important prerequisite for being an engineer. However, I think that creative problem solving is far more important, and is really the foundation of Engineering. With Wigl, we can develop this skill and get kids excited about Engineering!




Think outside the tablet
Today's robots for children require a separate screen interface (e.g. computer,
smartphone, tablet) for control, and this causes the majority of their attention to be
focused on that screen. We want to reduce screen-time, and I believe that
direct interaction with an educational robot will enhance their learning and
creativity. 


Wigl Perk Levels



The Wigl T-Shirt will be produced locally, navy blue with a white logo:





How will your funds help?
Our team has gone through five (5) different iterations to bring you the version that you see today. Each of these iterations included additional features/functionality that parents and children helped us identify. We've crossed major hurdles in note recognition, noise cancellation, and even majorly altered the internal components to bring the cost down.
With this current prototype, we are at the final hurdle. And we need your help to get Wigl out to children everywhere! 
Your funds will be used to cover the costs of production-quality plastics, professional PCB (printed circuit board) design, and improved functionality. We will be working with wonderfully talented Industrial Designers to prepare Wigl for mass production, and a quality Electronics Manufacturing to ensure high reliability circuitry!
Most of all, your donation will help us create a new type of educational robot. One that explores the creativity of children, without requiring a separate smart device / screen for control. 
Let's create a new generation of educational robotics for children!

About Wigl's Creator
Hi! I'm Vivek Mano, the creator
of Wigl. I'm an Electrical Engineer from the University of Florida.  While at UF, I created my first robot, an autonomous tennis-ball retrieving robot. Since then, I've had fun building various other hobby robots.
For the past 8 years, I have been involved in Sales, Marketing, and
Business Development within the Industrial Automation industry (big robots).
But my background, and my passion, is in embedded electronics and robotics
(smaller robots). Being able to combine both experiences is what led to Wigl.

Risks and
Challenges
Manufacturing
Creating the plastics tool (mold) takes anywhere from 20-30 weeks to be built. There is also a risk that first series articles will have slight abnormalities that need to be fixed. By using local manufacturing for both plastics and electronics, we will minimize those risks! 
Ambient noise
Since Wigl listens to everything, it's best used in a quiet environment. Having a TV on in the background, or in a group setting with people talking, causes Wigl to ""hear"" non-musical notes. Just like most sound-recognition devices (e.g. Siri), the quality of sound is paramount. 
We'll be working hard to minimize that through creative software and circuit designs. My Electrical Engineering background will come in handy! 

Frequently
Asked Questions
Will Wigl work with any instrument?

YES!
Wigl listens to everything: recorder, guitar, ukulele, flute, fiddle, bagpipes,
a singer's voice... anything that produces musical notes can control Wigl.



Wigl cannot distinguish individual notes from percussive instruments, such as drums. 
How is Wigl powered?
Since
Wigl is propelled by high quality DC motors, a 9V battery is used.

How does Wigl hear songs?
Just like the celebration dance to ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" in the video, Wigl dances when it hears complete songs and song snippets! Wigl listens for the correct sequence of notes, and if it likes what it hears, you'll know it! 

For which notes does Wigl listen?
Wigl listens for E5, F5, G5, A5, B5, C6, and D6.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
</div><div><p>Treasure's is dedicated to manufacturing
waterproof products. We hope to provide better waterproof care for your outdoor
job tasks and activities, and R-Cover is our first creation.</p></div><div>In
the past one and a half years, we studied the texture of different fabrics as
well as the styles and characteristics of different backpacks. We hoped to
create an item that can provide waterproof care to all kinds of backpacks. Multiple
prototypes were created after many adjustments and discussions with experts and
friends, which finally led to the birth of R-Cover. Despite the many challenges
we experienced in the past one and a half years, we felt extremely happy and
proud when we saw the final product. Our ideal product is finally completed,
and we believe it can help more people better protect their precious
belongings.</div><div>

Water-proof        easily stored       and easily used


We ran tests for a total of 49 backpacks and received excellent protection results.



Maybe you can use your backpack to run the 50th test for us!


Waterproof process is what R-Cover cares the most.
The water resistance of R-Cover fabric is as high as 3000 mm.



1,400 mm and below—For typical rainfall in the city for which an umbrella is needed

7,000 mm—For heavy rainfall which hurts when hitting on the skin

10,000 mm—For water pressure equivalent to that of a firefighting water jet

Therefore, a water resistance of 3,000 mm is more than enough for any outdoor activity in the city




Apart from essential waterproof processing, we also prepared R-Cover with water repellent for protection against splashing.


How R-Cover Works 

R-Cover is simple to use. 
You only need to fasten the three Velcro pieces, pulls down the fabric, and cover your backpack. 
Storage of R-Cover
It only takes 30 seconds to store R-Cover or get R-Cover ready for use.
Any backpack owner can easily get R-Cover ready for use.

Easier and Faster Way to Protect Your Backpack



If you hold on to the tag with the logo on it, storing R-Cover becomes a quick and easy job.


R-Cover gives you an option to quickly protect your backpack in rain. 
When it suddenly rains while you are on your way to work or to an outdoor activity,you only need to take out R-Cover and shield your backpack for a quick and efficient protection.
Moreover,the Velcro design helps R-Cover to secure any backpack ranging from 16L to 33L in size,helping you carry out any activity in the city problem-free.The product can be used in the following activities:














What other features does R-Cover have apart from covering any backpack?

Giving your backpack another layer of protection and preventing you belongings from being stolen when traveling with crowded public transportation on a rainy day.
Allowing quick and convenient access to things stored in your backpack.


Able to serve as a seat cover on a damp surface.
Long words short:R-Cover provides you with quick ways to solve various problems on a rainy day.

The Inspirations of R-Cover Patterns

We hope that R-Cover gives encouragement to its users every day, 
and therefore select the following three elements from many other ideas:

Ninja—We
hope that this pattern gives you strength and patience of a ninja
Astro—We

Camo—We
hope that this pattern helps you adapt to environmental changes like a soldier

Most importantly, we hope these patterns bring you passion for living as the previously mentioned professions.

With extra accessories, it is even more convenient to carry and store R-Cover around—hanging R-Cover on your backpack as an accessory wherever you go and never need to worry about losing it.

You may also clip other personal belongings with your R-Cover!







Our Story
Treasure's is dedicated to manufacturing
waterproof products. We hope to provide better waterproof care for your outdoor
job tasks and activities, and R-Cover is our first creation.In
the past one and a half years, we studied the texture of different fabrics as
well as the styles and characteristics of different backpacks. We hoped to
create an item that can provide waterproof care to all kinds of backpacks. Multiple
prototypes were created after many adjustments and discussions with experts and
friends, which finally led to the birth of R-Cover. Despite the many challenges
we experienced in the past one and a half years, we felt extremely happy and
proud when we saw the final product. Our ideal product is finally completed,
and we believe it can help more people better protect their precious
belongings.

<h3><strong>Why did we make it?</strong></h3>
<p>We at Nobleman decided to create something totally unique. We offer a helmet that provides lots of safety while being different. Most helmets are one color or multiple colors but they do not change color. Meaning over time it becomes boring in all situations. We took a different approach, during sunny days the color is fun and different. When riding in the evening or at the dark time the color goes back to its natural habitat (white). During different times of the day (depending on the light exposure) the helmet will vary in shade, resulting in a unique and special experience. You can even impress others with such technology by covering the helmet then exposing it to the sun. Making special and fun shapes that disappear is oddly satisfying with our K2 helmet. By using our helmet you can bond and start conversations with new people which will always lead to great and special experiences.</p>

<h3>What is the TRAK XL?</h3>
<p>We're excited to be here on Indiegogo to introduce our newest model!  The patent pending, TRAK XL, is a compact and lightweight everyday carry knife &amp; tool featuring our secure grip design.  TRAK XL is proudly designed and handcrafted in the USA.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536970548/mcxselx7bmnjrezluvnu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Our Story:</strong></h3>
<p>In 2016 we launched our first knife design on Kickstarter for: ""TRAK - Titanium Runner's Anywhere Knife"".  Backers loved it and TRAK quickly became a success. </p>
<p>The original concept for our TRAK design, was to function as a backup or ""last ditch"" knife for scuba divers caught in fishing line. We chose titanium because it was the perfect material for the job.  These design features also happen to make it the perfect knife for runners, hikers, camping, fishing or simply anyone looking for a personal, compact utility knife, which can be carried daily, securely.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536970583/qxdmr4kxjs2ldwkhfkkn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Following the completion of this successful TRAK campaign, we soon started working on our next model.  Based on feedback received from backers, we knew  this new model had to share the same great features as the original design (lightweight, rustproof, compact, secure, and easy to carry), but at the same time stand out on its own.  We wanted something slightly bigger and with a larger cutting edge.  We also wanted to improve the sheath system so that it could be mounted in multiple positions depending on desired use. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536970693/y4jlzlcf8kuy8afr9wdj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The new TRAK XL:</h3>
<p>After nearly a year of developing, testing, and refining different variations, we’re incredibly excited to be back on Kickstarter and introduce this new model: The TRAK XL.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536970859/fsxl32usdwlnvdtxrsgt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2> </h2>
</div><div>
<h3>Blade Material Options:</h3>
<p>The TRAK XL will be offered in 3 different blade steels:</p>
<h3><u>1) Titanium:</u></h3>
<p><strong>Titanium - Recommended for runners, fishing, boating, scuba diving, or hikers looking for a 100% rust proof knife with good edge retention.  Non-Ferrous/Non-Magnetic.</strong></p>
<p>The TRAK XL is available in military grade titanium (6AL-4V), which is typically found in military aircraft and aerospace. Some of the benefits of titanium are that it's lightweight, twice as strong as steel, rust proof, anti-corrosive, and non ferrous. The TRAK XL will hold up to any harsh conditions such as salt water, sweat, high humidity, or dirt without any sign of rust or corrosion. In fact, leave it at the bottom of the ocean for 100 years and it'll still look just like the day you put it there!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536971044/vnbamnorfppemgg5ffpe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><u>2) Z-Finit Nitrogen Steel:</u></h3>
<p><strong>Z-FiNit - Recommended for runners, fishing, boating, scuba diving, or hikers looking for excellent edge retention with above average rust/corrosion resistance.  Magnetic.</strong></p>
<p>What is Z-FiNit Steel?</p>
<p>Z-FiNit (Zapp Fine Grain Nitrogen Steel) Z-FiNit super steel is a high nitrogen, alloyed tool steel (similar to Spyderco's H1 Steel).  The advantage of adding nitrogen to steel is corrosion resistance. The nitrogen frees chromium to provide this corrosion resistance. You will find this steel used by NASA for its excellent wear resistance for machining ball bearing.  Z-FiNit is an excellent material for knife steel due to its corrosion resistance, hardness, and overall ease of sharpening. The Z-FiNit TRAK XL will be hardened to 59HRC by one of the world's leading heat treat facilities experienced in working with this material. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536971140/oiea7hkmosqb025letyc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Z-FiNit has been used by many of the top knife makers around the world and has proven to make an excellent knife steel for its ability to withstand corrosion better than most knife steels, as well as, its edge holding characteristics. Similar to AEB-L, but with a much higher corrosion resistance. Unlike titanium, Z-FiNit is ferrous, magnetic, and not 100% rustproof, however it does have greater corrosion resistance than typical knife steels such as 440C. Z-FiNit makes an excellent choice for those that wanted a TRAK XL with stainless steel properties, but with a much higher corrosion resistance.</p>
<h3>3) S35VN Stainless Steel:</h3>
<p><strong>Perfect for Hiking, Camping, Every Day Carry, and Utility.  Superior edge retention with good corrosion resistance.  Magnetic.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536971816/ay9wq8vtpussixq31k6t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536971697/ak94rewsdjb0jnywdzte.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>S35VN Stainless Steel is made in the USA by Crucible Industries specifically for specialized cutlery and long wearing industrial machine parts. Known for being 15-20% tougher than its predecessor and four times tougher than 440C and 154CM cutlery steel. S35VN is the perfect stainless steel for those looking for a knife edge that can withstand repeated usage with minimal wear and less frequent sharpening. S35VN does require heat treat, which will be done by an experienced HT facility.</p>
<h3>Carry Options:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536971938/us3ynfsqm4y1onlqz02i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>

</div><p> </p></div>","What is the TRAK XL?
We're excited to be here on Indiegogo to introduce our newest model!  The patent pending, TRAK XL, is a compact and lightweight everyday carry knife & tool featuring our secure grip design.  TRAK XL is proudly designed and handcrafted in the USA.  

Our Story:
In 2016 we launched our first knife design on Kickstarter for: ""TRAK - Titanium Runner's Anywhere Knife"".  Backers loved it and TRAK quickly became a success. 
The original concept for our TRAK design, was to function as a backup or ""last ditch"" knife for scuba divers caught in fishing line. We chose titanium because it was the perfect material for the job.  These design features also happen to make it the perfect knife for runners, hikers, camping, fishing or simply anyone looking for a personal, compact utility knife, which can be carried daily, securely.

Following the completion of this successful TRAK campaign, we soon started working on our next model.  Based on feedback received from backers, we knew  this new model had to share the same great features as the original design (lightweight, rustproof, compact, secure, and easy to carry), but at the same time stand out on its own.  We wanted something slightly bigger and with a larger cutting edge.  We also wanted to improve the sheath system so that it could be mounted in multiple positions depending on desired use. 


The new TRAK XL:
After nearly a year of developing, testing, and refining different variations, we’re incredibly excited to be back on Kickstarter and introduce this new model: The TRAK XL.


 

Blade Material Options:
The TRAK XL will be offered in 3 different blade steels:
1) Titanium:
Titanium - Recommended for runners, fishing, boating, scuba diving, or hikers looking for a 100% rust proof knife with good edge retention.  Non-Ferrous/Non-Magnetic.
The TRAK XL is available in military grade titanium (6AL-4V), which is typically found in military aircraft and aerospace. Some of the benefits of titanium are that it's lightweight, twice as strong as steel, rust proof, anti-corrosive, and non ferrous. The TRAK XL will hold up to any harsh conditions such as salt water, sweat, high humidity, or dirt without any sign of rust or corrosion. In fact, leave it at the bottom of the ocean for 100 years and it'll still look just like the day you put it there!

2) Z-Finit Nitrogen Steel:
Z-FiNit - Recommended for runners, fishing, boating, scuba diving, or hikers looking for excellent edge retention with above average rust/corrosion resistance.  Magnetic.
What is Z-FiNit Steel?
Z-FiNit (Zapp Fine Grain Nitrogen Steel) Z-FiNit super steel is a high nitrogen, alloyed tool steel (similar to Spyderco's H1 Steel).  The advantage of adding nitrogen to steel is corrosion resistance. The nitrogen frees chromium to provide this corrosion resistance. You will find this steel used by NASA for its excellent wear resistance for machining ball bearing.  Z-FiNit is an excellent material for knife steel due to its corrosion resistance, hardness, and overall ease of sharpening. The Z-FiNit TRAK XL will be hardened to 59HRC by one of the world's leading heat treat facilities experienced in working with this material. 

Z-FiNit has been used by many of the top knife makers around the world and has proven to make an excellent knife steel for its ability to withstand corrosion better than most knife steels, as well as, its edge holding characteristics. Similar to AEB-L, but with a much higher corrosion resistance. Unlike titanium, Z-FiNit is ferrous, magnetic, and not 100% rustproof, however it does have greater corrosion resistance than typical knife steels such as 440C. Z-FiNit makes an excellent choice for those that wanted a TRAK XL with stainless steel properties, but with a much higher corrosion resistance.
3) S35VN Stainless Steel:
Perfect for Hiking, Camping, Every Day Carry, and Utility.  Superior edge retention with good corrosion resistance.  Magnetic.

 

S35VN Stainless Steel is made in the USA by Crucible Industries specifically for specialized cutlery and long wearing industrial machine parts. Known for being 15-20% tougher than its predecessor and four times tougher than 440C and 154CM cutlery steel. S35VN is the perfect stainless steel for those looking for a knife edge that can withstand repeated usage with minimal wear and less frequent sharpening. S35VN does require heat treat, which will be done by an experienced HT facility.
Carry Options:


All of the TRAK XL models come with a thermoplastic Kydex sheath. This material (commonly found in aircraft bulkheads), is the standard sheath material for fixed blade knives.  Kydex is heated until soft and pliable, then vacuum formed around the knife.  Once cooled, the Kydex hardens and will fit your knife like a custom made glove.  Kydex is waterproof, lightweight, retains its shape better than leather, and can last a lifetime.

The TRAK XL sheath features two eyelets at top, which allow you to attach the included stainless steel ball chain.  You can also attach TRAK to a backpack, runner's arm band, belt, or anywhere you need it handy. 

*Optional belt clip with mounting hardware will be available.

Available Colors/Finish:
All of our TRAK XL knives will come with our standard finish : Natural Stonewash.  This is our toughest finish since the titanium is tumbled in a vibratory tumbler with ceramic stones.  These stones create thousands of tiny scratches/etchings on the surface.  This type of finish is the best type of finish for a knife that will be used as it hides any sheath rub marks, scratches, or use marks.

I conceived, I draw, and I designed. I am inspired by the Skulk and all the Henday residents that give unity about residence life in Henday Hall. Skulk image, the significant inspiration to the design. Today, I try to reproduce skulk in my design and let you to take it home.”The Inspiration:Basicly, the inspiration was from Henday's residence life. We drink, we skulk. Why not combine these two things together? Bang! When the beer meets Skulk beavers, here it comes the BeSkulker!  The Campaign:Dear Henday residents and alumni, This is an opportunity that you can own one of these stunning pieces. My passion drives me to bring this design to reality, and to you. Your contribution will makes you crucial to this project. I appreciate your support. Genuinely, I want it fabricated locally in Edmonton. However, the cost and delivery are not the best for this project with small production. Even in the early stage market research survey, the majority of people who are interested in this product, they more care about the price. Therefore, my job is to find the optimum manufacturer overseas to deliver you the best results as I can.3D Modeling and Rendering:Mockup and Prototyping:The first prototype (top) and the third prototye (botton):3D printed case:Add some music to your boozeSpecifications (Final design): Length: 8 centimeterWidth: 4 centimeterThickness: 0.5 centimeterWeight: 24 gramsMaterial: Aluminum Alloy 6063Process: Machining ( Laser cutting); Finishing (Anodizing with silver/gold/blue color)Blue and gold color:What I need:Most of fund goes to the cost of manufacturing and international shipping. The other fund will cover the cost of prototyping.What you get:BeSkulker is a unique keepsake that embodies the pride of Henday – Skulk, an important part of Henday tradition and heritage.It's not just about the your bottle opener, it's a dream that we can make it come true right here, in residence. It's about the faith for us and for other people to believe that everyone can actually do something!To people who have no clue about Skulk culture:There is no other animal as meaningful for Canada as the beaver.The beaver has been a long standing symbol of Canada, representing its unique history and economic development. For the sake of one of Canada’s most important national icons: the beaver. As long as you are a Canadian beaver lover out there, you should get BeSkulker!Bring it homeATTENTION PLEASE!Currently no shipping involved with this project. Sorry for people who lives outside of Edmonton. For more details please contact hughture@gmail.com.

<h3><em style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Our Story</em></h3>
<p>We are two guys from Nothern Michigan who developed a friendship through spending time together in the outdoors. Driving back and forth to the woods, we would bounce ideas off of each other of products we had concocted in our minds while in our deer stands...let's just say you've got a lot of time to think. Kevin approached Dan and proposed going into business together developing the products we had discussed. Both agreed it would be a great match between Dan's mechanical background and Kevin's marketing/sales background so ScentFree Outdoors, LLC was established in December 2001.</p>
<p>ScentFree Outdoors' mission is to design and develop innovative products for the outdoor industry with a focus on hunting, fishing, and camping.  We have been working on the R&amp;D of our first product for the last 11 years in total, but in January '05, we started completely from scratch with a new and revolutionary technology.   We hired a senior research engineer from a Tier 1, southeastern, research university to first prove the idea would work.  Once we had the initial lab test results, we knew that this technology needed to get into the hands of people all over the world. Kevin is married and has 5 beautiful children ranging from 16 to 2 years old.  Dan is also married and has 5 amazing children as well with ages ranging from 31 to 5 years old. That's right, he has two adult kids and five-year-old triplets!   </p>

<h2><em style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong>Safe, Efficient, Odorless Heat</strong></em></h2>
<p><em style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong><img alt=""Outdoor, Safe and Fun"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://infinitygraphicdesign.com/Marketing/Animation%20outdoors.gif"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Fishing""/></strong></em></p>
<p>We wanted to design a portable source of heat that would be safe, efficient, reliable, and odorless.  We've always known we wanted a classy design that people would be proud to use in any setting outdoors or around the house. But, we didn't stop there. We wanted to offer the world the first portable source of heat that accurately measures the surrounding area for harmful levels of CO and low levels of oxygen. If the oxygen level lowers and the CO level rises to unsafe levels, the heater will automatically shut off. nuDAWN HEAT was designed as a 2-in-1; it can be used as a heater or food/beverage warmer. Let's just say this is the ""Lexus"" of portable heaters. </p>
<p>We are so passionate about nuDAWN HEAT because we want to offer individuals and families a brand-new technology that will give them the security of knowing they are safe. We've worked endless hours designing a product people will be able to use for years to come. Early on we set a high standard and have never waivered from it...we want the nuDAWN Heater to be the last heater a person will need to buy.</p>
<p>As a backer of the nuDAWN Heat project, you will play a major role in launching this revolutionary technology to the market.  As indicated in the video, people around the world are tragically losing their lives every year to carbon monoxide poisoning. With your support we can do our part to help reduce those statistics by offering people a safe and reliable way to stay WARM!</p>
<h2><em><strong>Revolutionizing Portable Space Heat: what makes nuDAWN different</strong></em></h2>

<p><em><strong>JetCOrrect Technology.</strong></em> Other infrared or catalytic heaters currently being offered only use pure fuel, LP, directly from the tank. There are certain additives and impurities in the gas that don't burn off, causing CO and other gases to saturate the environment.</p>
<p>Our JetCOrrect Technology mixes the fuel with outside air which creates the optimum mixture of fuel and air. This fuel mixture then enters our combustion chamber.

We are two guys from Nothern Michigan who developed a friendship through spending time together in the outdoors. Driving back and forth to the woods, we would bounce ideas off of each other of products we had concocted in our minds while in our deer stands...let's just say you've got a lot of time to think. Kevin approached Dan and proposed going into business together developing the products we had discussed. Both agreed it would be a great match between Dan's mechanical background and Kevin's marketing/sales background so ScentFree Outdoors, LLC was established in December 2001.
ScentFree Outdoors' mission is to design and develop innovative products for the outdoor industry with a focus on hunting, fishing, and camping.  We have been working on the R&D of our first product for the last 11 years in total, but in January '05, we started completely from scratch with a new and revolutionary technology.   We hired a senior research engineer from a Tier 1, southeastern, research university to first prove the idea would work.  Once we had the initial lab test results, we knew that this technology needed to get into the hands of people all over the world. Kevin is married and has 5 beautiful children ranging from 16 to 2 years old.  Dan is also married and has 5 amazing children as well with ages ranging from 31 to 5 years old. That's right, he has two adult kids and five-year-old triplets!   

Safe, Efficient, Odorless Heat

We wanted to design a portable source of heat that would be safe, efficient, reliable, and odorless.  We've always known we wanted a classy design that people would be proud to use in any setting outdoors or around the house. But, we didn't stop there. We wanted to offer the world the first portable source of heat that accurately measures the surrounding area for harmful levels of CO and low levels of oxygen. If the oxygen level lowers and the CO level rises to unsafe levels, the heater will automatically shut off. nuDAWN HEAT was designed as a 2-in-1; it can be used as a heater or food/beverage warmer. Let's just say this is the ""Lexus"" of portable heaters. 
We are so passionate about nuDAWN HEAT because we want to offer individuals and families a brand-new technology that will give them the security of knowing they are safe. We've worked endless hours designing a product people will be able to use for years to come. Early on we set a high standard and have never waivered from it...we want the nuDAWN Heater to be the last heater a person will need to buy.
As a backer of the nuDAWN Heat project, you will play a major role in launching this revolutionary technology to the market.  As indicated in the video, people around the world are tragically losing their lives every year to carbon monoxide poisoning. With your support we can do our part to help reduce those statistics by offering people a safe and reliable way to stay WARM!
Revolutionizing Portable Space Heat: what makes nuDAWN different

JetCOrrect Technology. Other infrared or catalytic heaters currently being offered only use pure fuel, LP, directly from the tank. There are certain additives and impurities in the gas that don't burn off, causing CO and other gases to saturate the environment.
Our JetCOrrect Technology mixes the fuel with outside air which creates the optimum mixture of fuel and air. This fuel mixture then enters our combustion chamber. The chamber recirculates a portion of the hot exhaust emissions which then increases efficiences even more.  To put it plainly, we are burning off nearly 100 percent of the harmful exhaust gases as a result of creating a fuel mixture and keeping the exhaust in the combustion chamber just a fraction of a second longer. Therefore, by burning off these impurities in the fuel, the heat becomes odorless.
The combustion chamber faces extreme heat. Originally, we were going to use a stainless steel combustion chamber, but it became apparent that it wouldn't be able to withstand extremely high temperatures over a long period of time. Inconel is used in jet engines because it is able to withstand jet engine exhaust systems. We decided it was worth the additional cost to use the best material for our combustion chamber, because we knew it would hold up over the life of the heater increasing the heater's reliability.
Stainless Steel Shell.  Since day one, we knew we wanted nuDAWN to look classy and be durable.  Plastic can break easily and it doesn't take much to dent aluminum. We selected the optimum gauge of stainless steel to help with the overall weight of the heater, while not compromising the durability. A bonus feature about using stainless steel is that it radiates the heat long after the heater is shut down, similar to a radiator in the home.  
Smart Sensor Technology. One of our suppliers, SST Sensing Ltd based in Scotland, was very flexible in their approach. They adapted their sensor design as our product evolved, and they were always eager to provide advice and support. nuDAWN HEAT will offer the first portable source of heat to incorporate smart sensors that accurately take readings of carbon monoxide and oxygen. Different from other heaters currently offered that have an ODS (or pressure sensor), nuDAWN is engingeered to take readings of the surrounding air. The smart sensor is calibrated, or programmed, to the exact levels required by the CSA (Canadian Standard Association) to be marketed ""indoor safe.""  Why is that significant?  nuDAWN will be the first heater to take readings and automatically shut down based on carbon monoxide levels. 
nuDAWN HEAT: its many benefits and uses

 The nuDAWN HEAT can be used in many different applications: hunting, fishing, boating, camping, garage, natural disaster preparation, are just a few of them.  In addition, there is a growing trend in America of people that are downsizing their homes to much less square footage and nuDAWN HEAT would be a perfect compliment to their home heating needs.  
Since we designed nuDAWN as a 2-in-1, the user can heat a food or beverage on it. This comes in handy when outside weathering the elements.
""Green"" technology has been increasing in awareness and importance in recent years, and we are proud to say that because of nuDAWN's nearly 100 percent efficiency, less emissions are being released into the atmosphere while reducing fuel consumption.
The MSRP on nuDAWN HEAT is $449.95.

Engineered to simplify drone flight, Fluidity pilots can pick up the FT Aviator and fly right out of the box - professionals and hobbyists alike.Compatible today with almost all DJI drones, this unique controller works collaboratively with the native DJI radio, and Fluidity app for both Android and iOS.When an astronaut designs a drone controllerUsing an astronaut’s perspective on intuitive motion through space, we have patented a unique and intuitive drone controller that anyone, whether they’re eight or eighty, can pick up and begin using immediately.  The FT Aviator is designed to incorporate the relevant 4 degrees of freedom of movement (x, y, z, and yaw) to drone flying, eliminating the awkward interface and steeper learning curve of existing dual thumb-controlled drones. It intuitively unlocks human potential to fly and capture stunning imagery. 
Intuitive flight control in one hand eliminates the complexity of dual thumb controllers
Smooth, controlled flight, virtually eliminating aircraft instability
Advanced camera controls for high quality photo and video capture
Situational display indicators so you always know your drone's location and orientation 
Easy to use, right out of the box
5-hour battery life
Compatible with most DJI drones, including the Mavic, Phantom, Inspire and Matrice series*

<p>Hi, my name is Vahit. I am a knife enthusiast and a designer. As a son of a farmer, folding knives has taken apart of my EDC routine since i was a little kid, and the enthusiasm has grown bigger and bigger on me over years to this present day. I have owned and carried many knives, but almost none of them were able to fulfill my daily needs to the end and satisfy my aesthetic preferences at the same time. Then, i realized that i need to make a knife that i would be please to carry for the rest of my life. And the idea of THE WOLVERINE has born.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539329536/m3ewiw8s6ityrr4tjr5z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My inspiration for this project is Wolverine, one of the fiercest beasts on the earth, which can cope with almost every environmental adversity and can defend itself from some of the most dangerous predators that are multiple times heavier and bigger than itself.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539329583/brskkqvedowu30msrhoe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It began from a sketch and evolved multiple times thanks to the members of social knife communities all over the world. The Wolverine is aiming this key features:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Built to Last:</strong></u> The Wolverine uses the most advanced precision manufacturing techniques on the Earth and it is made to last for decades. This is a knife that can pass one generation to another.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Material Quality:</strong></u> The Wolverine combines some of the most high-end materials that can be used on a folding knife.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Style:</strong></u> The main aim of the concept was to create an interactive design which would be refined by the contributions of the other knife enthusiasts according to their needs and inspirations. The design of the Wolverine has evolved its final form with the feedbacks and suggestions of the knife enthusiasts all around the world. This is your design truly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Price:</strong></u> One of the most important parts of this project is to get some of the most premium materials that can be used on a folding knife and combine them with the most advanced manufacturing techniques, while keeping it as affordable as it can be. The Wolverine is designed for the most, and priced for the most. </p>

My inspiration for this project is Wolverine, one of the fiercest beasts on the earth, which can cope with almost every environmental adversity and can defend itself from some of the most dangerous predators that are multiple times heavier and bigger than itself.

It began from a sketch and evolved multiple times thanks to the members of social knife communities all over the world. The Wolverine is aiming this key features:
 
Built to Last: The Wolverine uses the most advanced precision manufacturing techniques on the Earth and it is made to last for decades. This is a knife that can pass one generation to another.
 
Material Quality: The Wolverine combines some of the most high-end materials that can be used on a folding knife.
 
Style: The main aim of the concept was to create an interactive design which would be refined by the contributions of the other knife enthusiasts according to their needs and inspirations. The design of the Wolverine has evolved its final form with the feedbacks and suggestions of the knife enthusiasts all around the world. This is your design truly. 
 
Price: One of the most important parts of this project is to get some of the most premium materials that can be used on a folding knife and combine them with the most advanced manufacturing techniques, while keeping it as affordable as it can be. The Wolverine is designed for the most, and priced for the most. 

Features:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Marva Gregorio De Souza, aka Pixie.  I am a writer, radio producer, filmmaker and love to travel and discover new places and things.  Pixie Stay Properties will allow me to utilise both my managerial and creative skills as well as fulfill a long term desire to venture into property development.  Naturally, I'm extremely excited about it.</p>
<p>The plan is to raise funds in order to purchase the first place at auction and fix it up Pixie style!  With games, curiosities and activities as well as being a beautiful place to stay.  I've decided to focus on University cities in the UK as they all tend to be filled with plenty of history, culture and lots to see and do.  Pixie Stay Properties will add to this, from the moment you put the key in the door.  And it being Great Britain, regardless of the weather you'll have a fantastic stay.  You won't be disappointed!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would like to ideally raise £100k as this will allow me to purchase the first property at auction and renovate it ready to go on short-term let platforms, such as Airbnb.</p>
<p>There are several excellent deals on the table for contributors, the main one being a 2 night stay for those who contribute £50.  This means you could possibly stay in Bath, Oxford, London, Edinburgh or Cardiff for two nights for just £50.  And the cheap price would not be reflected in your surroundings!  As I will be buying the property at auction, I've kept the first location flexible, however there are no bad pennies on my list, and if you don't like the first location I choose you can save your reward for one of my future Pixie Stay Properties.  If you're a fan of short breaks or love unique experiences this campaign is for you!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge will be to find a suitable property at auction and within budget.  If I don't raise enough funds to buy a property at auction then whatever I raise will be used as a deposit for a mortgage.  Pixie Stay Properties will be birthed!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know £50 is a lot for some people, which is why I've included offers for contributions of £10 and trust me these are life changing offers not to be missed.  Whichever option you go for, please, please, please share the offer with your friends and family.  Indiegogo gives lots of opportunities for sharing on social media.  Any time I've mentioned my Pixie Stay Properties idea the response has been very positive and I'm sure you agree.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a farmer most of my life I have made things to help make jobs more efficient or easier. I always loved dirt track stock car races and wanted to drive a race car myself. At age 49 I bought a 76 Camaro and drove 4 races. I sometimes led a few heat race laps and then I'd spin out. I didn't have the resources to continue. It was the thrill of a life time. While thinking about races often I come up with the idea for RACECARCoolers made just like a racing car and customized for each driver. I have spent most of my time the past 3 years bringing this project to reality. I'm so excited to have the opportunity to bring a new and unique product to avid NASCAR fans. I'm glad you are considering being a partner to help get this project going. 400 tailgating fans were interviewed at Kansas Speedway.  I was blown away by the enthusiasm.  They said ""That is so cool.  Where can I get one.""  Your partnership will be the catalyst to provide a cooler for each of those 400 avid fans plus millions more like yourself.  Share my excitement and get on board.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This project is on the all or none funding.  It is too huge and important for the project to get started and run out of money and fail.  No one would be happy in that situation.  My detailed plan will require $3,000,000 to make this an overwhelming sucess.  I have funded many things thus far; patenting, design engineer, prototyping, most of my time and resoures for 3 years.  The project is READY NOW.  Your contributions will provide for tool and die making, design engineer drawing for that tooling, blow molding of the cooler body and lids, graphic artist and decaling, boxes for shipment, warehouse lease to finish assembly of hinges and customize with your desired graphics, and an office space with shipping facilities.  All of the above businesses are ready to do their portion of building a customized RACECARCooler.  When you all partner with me to fully fund the project then promotion via ESPN ads at NASCAR Sprint Cup races will let every avid NASCAR fan in the world know about ""our"" cooler.  That is correct you can claim it as our's because of your sharing my passion to fully fund our project. </p>
<p></p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our blow molder is located in a smaller rural type community.  I have met with the city commission to share our project's possibilities. This community is very welcoming for this project to become reality. Everything is going to be 100% USA.  The detailed plans call for a steady hiring of 160 people in the first months of production. This project is not enormous as big corporations, but it will certainly benefit our country and thus each individual.  There are fans worldwide who will share the excitement and value of our project.</p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary
As a farmer most of my life I have made things to help make jobs more efficient or easier. I always loved dirt track stock car races and wanted to drive a race car myself. At age 49 I bought a 76 Camaro and drove 4 races. I sometimes led a few heat race laps and then I'd spin out. I didn't have the resources to continue. It was the thrill of a life time. While thinking about races often I come up with the idea for RACECARCoolers made just like a racing car and customized for each driver. I have spent most of my time the past 3 years bringing this project to reality. I'm so excited to have the opportunity to bring a new and unique product to avid NASCAR fans. I'm glad you are considering being a partner to help get this project going. 400 tailgating fans were interviewed at Kansas Speedway.  I was blown away by the enthusiasm.  They said ""That is so cool.  Where can I get one.""  Your partnership will be the catalyst to provide a cooler for each of those 400 avid fans plus millions more like yourself.  Share my excitement and get on board.


What We Need & What You Get
This project is on the all or none funding.  It is too huge and important for the project to get started and run out of money and fail.  No one would be happy in that situation.  My detailed plan will require $3,000,000 to make this an overwhelming sucess.  I have funded many things thus far; patenting, design engineer, prototyping, most of my time and resoures for 3 years.  The project is READY NOW.  Your contributions will provide for tool and die making, design engineer drawing for that tooling, blow molding of the cooler body and lids, graphic artist and decaling, boxes for shipment, warehouse lease to finish assembly of hinges and customize with your desired graphics, and an office space with shipping facilities.  All of the above businesses are ready to do their portion of building a customized RACECARCooler.  When you all partner with me to fully fund the project then promotion via ESPN ads at NASCAR Sprint Cup races will let every avid NASCAR fan in the world know about ""our"" cooler.  That is correct you can claim it as our's because of your sharing my passion to fully fund our project. 




The Impact
Our blow molder is located in a smaller rural type community.  I have met with the city commission to share our project's possibilities. This community is very welcoming for this project to become reality. Everything is going to be 100% USA.  The detailed plans call for a steady hiring of 160 people in the first months of production. This project is not enormous as big corporations, but it will certainly benefit our country and thus each individual.  There are fans worldwide who will share the excitement and value of our project.


Other Ways You Can Help


LICENSING - How you can help
All RACECARCoolers  must be licensed and have the legal rights from NASCAR and race teams.  In order to demonstrate your excitement of a new and unique product  to NASCAR, please copy and paste the following list and email NASCAR and the race teams.  Let our voice be heard!

<p>Advent NEON's got a large focus on <strong>simple to learn mechanics with a high skill ceiling</strong>, with lots of room for <strong>skill expression</strong>. Neon has a<strong> full platform fighter's moveset to achieve this</strong>. The experience should feel fun, whether you're new, a veteran, an ultra-optimal speedrunner, or someone just looking to wavedash! Some of these mechanics include:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Directional &amp; Aerial Attacks</strong> - similar to attacks from Smash Bros!</li>
<li>
<strong> 8-Way Dashing </strong>- the kind of dash from Celeste, but even faster!</li>
<li>
<strong> Time Stop</strong> - dash into danger at the right time to freeze everything!</li>
<li>
<strong> Cancelling </strong>- Perform new attacks and actions before old ones finish!</li>
<li>
<strong> Nodes &amp; Healing</strong> - Collect them to increase Resonance and restore HP!</li>
<li>
<strong> Resonance</strong> - A percentage gauge that increases your damage output. Reach 100% to achieve...</li>

</div></div>","Tear up robots with lightspeed attacks and agility. Stop time, and transform when you reach MAX power! Exceed the limits you're used to, and hone Neon's ability to an instinct. Feel the power, in this solo-dev'd passion project inspired by legends like Sonic the Hedgehog, Dragonball, Super Smash Bros, Celeste, Bayonetta and Megaman! 
 




Try it for yourself! Experience Central District, a full area containing 4 levels, 2 bosses, a tutorial and a training room! Over 350,000 people across multiple platforms have already played and enjoyed the demo and nearly 10,000 have wishlisted on Steam! 
 


Take to Neopolis, a gargantuan metropolis that serves as the hub for the world's robots, to stop its absorption of Resonance, the planet's life force. Neon, a super fighting robot who can harness Resonance energy, is set in motion by their creator's soul being split from his body. Neon hopes that shutting the city down, and confronting Prof. Franca and her powerful Divas across Neopolis, the planet will re-stabilize and Prof. Oganesson can be made whole again.
 


Advent NEON's got a large focus on simple to learn mechanics with a high skill ceiling, with lots of room for skill expression. Neon has a full platform fighter's moveset to achieve this. The experience should feel fun, whether you're new, a veteran, an ultra-optimal speedrunner, or someone just looking to wavedash! Some of these mechanics include:

 Directional & Aerial Attacks - similar to attacks from Smash Bros!

 8-Way Dashing - the kind of dash from Celeste, but even faster!

 Time Stop - dash into danger at the right time to freeze everything!

 Cancelling - Perform new attacks and actions before old ones finish!

 Nodes & Healing - Collect them to increase Resonance and restore HP!

 Resonance - A percentage gauge that increases your damage output. Reach 100% to achieve...

 


As a reward for skillful play, transform into MAX Neon and snowball to nearly game-breaking levels of power, with maximized damage and speed, to wreak havoc on all before you, as long as you don't get hit! 
 


My goal is to make Advent NEON fun and fluid in any player's hands. To this end, committing to accessibility, tight controls and a lit gamefeel has been key, featuring:

 Simple, remappable controls
Gamepad, keyboard, mouse support
 No lives or ""game overs""
Tweakable visual effects 
A training room to practice in
 Becoming too angry to die if you're having a rough time!



 The full game plans to have at least:

7 Districts (""worlds""), containing at least 28 levels
2 bosses per District
Mini-bosses in majority of levels
More accessibility and practice options
Options for hardcore and skilled players
Flashy finishing move for Max Neon
Optional content to unlock with your collected Nodes
One alternate game mode 



Name's Larry Boyd (CryoGX), and I'm an artist from NC, responsible for everything you've seen, heard and felt so far (art, music, animations, programming, sound, etc). I've been interested in creating ever since childhood, and have always been making art and music. I'd decided to get a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in game development, to really research and understand everything I'd need for my goals. Now that I'm out, Advent NEON is my way of applying all of that research and skill at once, to make the exact kind of game I want to see, knowing I'm the one who can make it.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>xScreen was in-house developed then prototyped with 3D printing.  Several prototype versions have been evaluated and discarded on the journey to the first working prototype.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/949/398/997dece1a5ef1968cf282764c577ef34_original.gif?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1624191350&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=7437f2ccb857d5e4017d49e21d47a0af"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Early CAD designs and the first 3D printed Prototype</i></p>
<p>In the early stages, the design had to be printed in two sections (see the split in the rear photo above) due to the size limitations of the 3D printer. UPspec Gaming has since invested in larger 3D printers to enable a rapid prototyping process.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/871/665/667a3d21c947f5eaab726c5a576bf628_original.gif?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1623576342&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e7cdcae91f6d7cd88759b33d8717d50f"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Prototyping process with 3D printing.</i></p>
<p>Design changes have occured during evolution of the protoype. One example of these changes has been the attachment of the xScreen to the Xbox, which has changed from simple pressure latches to the thumb screw latches in use today.</p>
<p>Design has een finalised, below is the exploded view of the final design. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628247677/gi37cvpnigurenb3tbbs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The final production model will use plastic that matches the Xbox Series S for a seamless finish. <strong> For the prototype it is not possible to perfectly color match when 3D printing which is why the xScreen white is slightly different for the prototype.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Get ready to game more with xScreen The power and performance of the Xbox Series S can now be taken anywhere. xScreen perfectly complements the stunning aesthetic of the Xbox Series S to create a single cohesive unit.  xScreen transforms your Xbox Series S into a laptop form factor that can be easily transported and used anywhere there is a power outlet.    As seen on   And many more...  The games we enjoy the most have always been on traditional full-power consoles with wired connections to a TV.  Unfortunately a TV isn't always readily available so as a result there are many situations where we have had to compromise: 
Having to compete for the TV with other family members.
Wanting something to do when travelling, camping/glamping and wet weather strikes.
Travelling for work with a console and spending more time trying to connect to a hotel TV than actually playing a game.
Having friends over or visiting friends for a gaming session required packing up TV's, cables and consoles then lugging it all to the destination. Once you get there, trying to find the space for 3-4 friends to setup can be difficult.
  

 
We developed xScreen so that we could keep gaming when the big screen at home is not available or when we are visiting friends, going on holiday or anywhere else we want to still play full-power console games away from a fixed screen.We made the xScreen for ourselves and our families. We have had such a positive response, we thought you might like it too...With the release of Microsoft’s Xbox Series S, we saw an opportunity to create a portable full-power console due to its small form factor. The xScreen has an integrated design that connects to the Xbox Series S with a removable folding screen and included speakers providing a laptop like experience on a console.  Unlike previous solutions, due to the small form factor, the xScreen + Xbox Series S can easily be transported in any standard backpack. The xScreen's unique patent pending attachment connects directly into the HDMI and USB ports on the Xbox Series S. The USB powers the xScreen while the HDMI provides the screen and audio signal. The only cable required is the original power cable that came with the Xbox Series S.    1. Attach the xScreen to the HDMI and USB ports.Align the HDMI and USB ports with the Xbox Series S 2. Secure the side latches.Thumb screw on each side of the xScreen, securing the xScreen to the Xbox Series S 3. Plug in the power cable.The original Xbox power cable plugs in via the rectangle gap in the back of the xScreen, directly into the Xbox Series S 4. Game time!!Game time in nearly no time at all!!  In this demo we show the xScreen attaching, plus how the official Seagate Expansion drive works with the xScreen for Xbox Series S.  Check out the demonstration and some Assassin’s Creed Valhalla gameplay at the same time!

 

 

 

 
We will have additional accessories that will be available in the checkout post Indiegogo.

xScreen Colored Latches. Do you want to stand out from the Crowd or not want to mix up your xScreen with friends? Pick a color and make a statement.

 

xScreen Stand Feet. To add some viewing height while playing using the xScreen - just clip on the two stand feet and turn the Xbox Series S into a screen stand for the xScreen!

 

xScreen EVA Case. This holds the xScreen,  Xbox Series S plus controller and power cable.

 

 
xScreen was in-house developed then prototyped with 3D printing.  Several prototype versions have been evaluated and discarded on the journey to the first working prototype.

Early CAD designs and the first 3D printed Prototype
In the early stages, the design had to be printed in two sections (see the split in the rear photo above) due to the size limitations of the 3D printer. UPspec Gaming has since invested in larger 3D printers to enable a rapid prototyping process.

Prototyping process with 3D printing.
Design changes have occured during evolution of the protoype. One example of these changes has been the attachment of the xScreen to the Xbox, which has changed from simple pressure latches to the thumb screw latches in use today.
Design has een finalised, below is the exploded view of the final design. 

 
The final production model will use plastic that matches the Xbox Series S for a seamless finish.  For the prototype it is not possible to perfectly color match when 3D printing which is why the xScreen white is slightly different for the prototype.
 

 
Our timeline shown below provides a realistic plan for the production and delivery of the xScreen to you.  However we aim to do better, with our ultimate stretch goal is to deliver your xScreen before the end of year.  Watch out for updates!

 

 
UPspec Gaming is an Australian based start-up focussed on designing and selling unique gaming accessories. The company is founded by two Kiwi brothers who have been gaming together for over 30 years! xScreen is the first product from UPspec Gaming, with several other products already in the pipeline. 

 
MorphoMFG is our partner for all things manufacturing. From plastic injected moulding to the assembly line and quality control, MorphoMFG are ensuring your xScreen is made to the highest of standards.

Proceed to checkout.
After the campaign, we will contact you asking what physical version (PC, PS4, PSVR , XBOX or SWITCH) you want.

Carter wakes up on a bed in a strange room. He can’t remember anything, not even his own name, but the guards guarding the door make him suspect something is not right. His first goal will be to escape from there and find out what is happening. When Carter's friends discover that he has disappeared, they move heaven and earth to find him. They will have to overcome many obstacles in a race against the clock, since if they do not succeed before nighttime, the world as we know it could come to an end. Delve into an absorbing horror-tinged suspenseful story, based on the Lovecraft mythos. Explore iconic places of the Region de Murcia, investigate and solve puzzles to discover who is behind all this madness. You will have to walk in the shoes of four characters with four different paths and destinations... But, be careful! The decisions you make can have unexpected consequences. 

Four characters, four points of view, various murders and disappearances, and a story where everything converges. Get inside the head of these different characters to investigate all the clues and hints, each with their unique abilities and characteristics, but all with a common goal: to discover the truth. Will they be ready for what they may find? Will you be? Carter Scott
30 years old.
Carter wakes up in a hospital bed. He doesn't remember anything, and a terrible headache prevents him from thinking clearly. On the other side of the door he can see an armed guard guarding his room. Why is he there? Who is he? The only thing he knows for sure is that he has to get out of there.​ James Oslac
37 years old. Private investigator.
James is a private detective. Taciturn and melancholic, but with a keen eye for detail. He does not leave any case unresolved, whatever happens, least of all this one. This time he has not been hired, it is something personal. One of his best friends has disappeared and he thinks he has a hint as to where he may be. He will use every means available to him to find his friend, although he may have to risk his own life, or something more important. Christopher Black
27 years old. Journalist.
Christopher always wanted to be a journalist. Since he was little, he dreamed of discovering a great scandal and uncovering it on the cover of a large newspaper. He hasn’t found the exclusive  that will make him famous yet, but he's about to get there. Heist, kidnappings, ritual murders, the story that he is investigating has all the ingredients to grant him the recognition he deserves. What he doesn't know is that his investigation is much bigger and far more dangerous than he imagines. Sophie Whalen
55 years old. History teacher.
History professor for over 30 years. She loves her work at the university and is involved in an ambitious research of an ancient cult and its repercussions on the main religions. She has a very quiet life, always locked in offices and libraries, buried in books or consulting old archives. But soon her whole existence will be turned upside down. What if all the myths she has read about were true? What if all those creatures and dark deities really did exist? ​ 

Ghouls
Humanoid beings with canine-looking features and a very pale complexion. Perhaps at some point they were human, but not anymore. They feed on human flesh, so, if found, it would be near cemeteries. They can be incredibly strong despite their scrawny and lanky appearance. Deep ones
They could be mistaken by humans, at least in their earliest stages. But as they get closer to their “final form” they begin to resemble fish-like creatures, with bulging eyes and skin covered in scales. They live in areas near the coast where they can keep a constant contact with sea water. Lizardmen
Nobody knows where they come from, but they have been around us for a long time. Their real appearance is that of a lizard with a human shape, but you will never see one like that. They live among us using their ""abilities"" to seem like humans. It is said that they possess a very vast knowledge and that they will help those who serve them well... 

Desolatium is a new way to fully immerse yourself, in first person, in the Point & Click Graphic Adventure genre. It incorporates features of Survival Horror so that you can live a unique experience, such as real settings, the ambisonic sound (8D), a Lovecraftian narrative and hyper-realistic graphics, enriching your gaming experience.   Full immersion
To get you fully immersed we have invested all our efforts into enhancing the sound and hyper-realistic graphics, combining them with a chilling story based on Lovecraft’s Myths, and with a decision-making system that will transport you straight into a story like you have never experienced before.
Live the most immersive DESOLATIUM experience with the VR version (OculusRift, HTC VIVE and PSVR) or enjoy a more classic experience without virtual reality (PC / Mac) with a desktop version. 
Hyper realistic graphics
All the levels are generated by recording real locations in 360º, with the subtle integration of 3D elements, to transport you directly into the insane universe of DESOLATIUM. 8D/3D sound
This type of audio generates a surrounding sound effect that comes from many different directions at once, creating the feeling of being in a real life scenario where danger lurks in every corner... a few steps behind you... a chilling scream at your right...
Can you imagine hearing the piercing sounds of an Ancient God chasing you as you try to overcome obstacles on your way out? And to enjoy all this experience you only need your headphones.

Multiple endings
Will you be able to avoid more murders? Will you discover who is behind this?... Or maybe you will prefer to take part in a ritual?... The paths you follow and the decisions you make will mark your course... and your end. Highly awarded
The DESOLATIUM project has been awarded and nominated on multiple occasions, being the following awards and nominations the most outstanding ones: Music
We are honored to have XABI SAN MARTÍN in our team, composer and keyboardist in the band La Oreja de Van Gogh, who will be the composer of the DESOLATIUM soundtrack. He has been a huge video game lover from a very young age, both playing and participating in their development.

""Well, this… this game I think is one of the most absorbing and terrifying proposals that I’ve found lately, and I am quite up to date with the [videogame] sector. And the truth is that it is a real challenge trying to find an ambiance that fits the visual universe, you know? of this gem.
Of course, we have terrifying images and a wonderfully written and absorbing story, and so I think that in order to match that I am going to rescue the oldest, dustiest, rustiest synthesizers that I have, because I am going… I believe it is the time to start recording without any type of metronome or tuning… That is, I believe we need something rusty and horrible and suffocating to accompany the player in this “bad time” the game is proposing.
So like I said, I think this is the challenge, this is going to be the key to the ambiance of this game, and well… let’s hope we can rise to the challenge. I also have some experience with other games, but this one seems particularly challenging. So, well, I hope everything goes well, that we can have the whole game in our hands soon, and that we can all enjoy it… with some Sintrom nearby, because when I played the demo I almost spit my heart out.
So, that’s it… It’s a pleasure to greet you all and see you very soon.""

<p>My plan is to develop<i> Nusantara: Bermuda Triangl</i>e in a <strong>timeframe of 1 year</strong>. At the latest, it will be finished around early winter, 2018. Nevertheless, I will <strong>update every Monday</strong>. I've been doing this consistently for more than 2 years with my 1st &amp; 2nd project at <a href=""https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43&amp;t=40655"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lemmasoft forum</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SweetChielVNs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook fanpage</a>, so you will know exactly what I'm doing every week.</p>
<p>A lot of time will be invested in writing &amp; editing. <i>Bermuda</i> will be <strong>a lot longer</strong> than my 1st project; <i>Nusantara: Legend of the Winged Ones.</i> For reference, the total of <i>Bermuda's</i> demo word count is <strong>48k+ words</strong> while <i>Winged Ones</i>' demo is only around <strong>19.5k+ words</strong>. </p>
<p>I am determined to finish this project no matter what so I set the funding type to be <strong>Flexible. </strong>However much I gain will be used for my project's development, pay the composers, pay the bills, and feed my 2 pups -granted, it will be slower and simpler since I need to do side-jobs. It has been my dream to be able to work at home surrounded by the things I love, so this is a big step for me. </p>
<p>Other expenses will be through my own pocket and further strengthened later by that 5% from funding plan.</p>
<h3><i><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT GAME DISTRIBUTION:</strong></i></h3>
<p>The finished game will be published in itch.io. Backers who have pledged for ""<i>Early Birds"", ""The Game &lt;3"", and ""One for me &amp; One for my buddy!"" </i>will be given<i> </i><strong>itch.io</strong> <strong>Download Keys</strong>. Simply make an itch.io account, click the Download Key's link, and claim ownership to prevent anyone else from using it. After claiming ownership, you will be directed to the download page for Mac/Windows/Linux.</p>
<p><strong>I will set the system so <u>One key</u> is for the use of <u>One person</u> only. </strong><br/> </p>
<h3><i><strong>What about Steam?</strong></i></h3>
<p>I am willing to try Steam Greenlight if the first goal is reached &amp; a lot of you want it on Steam. If the Greenlight succeeded, I will distribute Steam Keys instead of itch.io's Download Keys.</p>
<p>Edit*: you can still request me for itch.io Download Keys if you don't want Steam keys.</p>

</td></tr></tbody></table></div>","WARNINGS: Swearing, blood, death, psychological, and a little gore.Rating: 16+In 20XX, an enormous earthquake shook the world and caused a triangular crater to suddenly appear in the middle of Bermuda Triangle. The world was aghast with this discovery; even more so when scout teams discovered an ‘invisible wall’ around it, preventing further investigation. As if it wasn’t enough, spiritual events also increased all over the world after this phenomenon occurred.Our heroine, Maya (19), was a young adult who was busy earning her living so this kind of event was of little importance aside from adding an exciting spice into her life. But then her world crumbled when a Goddess came and announced that her family would die in a car accident in the near future.The Goddess offered Maya a deal: She would alter her family’s fate in exchange for closing the Bermuda Crater. To do that, Maya would have to go to a place called Forgotten Isles, find what caused it, and look for a solution.If she agreed, three men will accompany her, acting as bodyguards. Apparently, they each have their own circumstances and a wish to be granted.Pledge with Paypal!You want to pledge, but don't have a credit card? No problem! Backers can now pledge via Paypal.  To be fair, the limited edition pledges; ""Early Birds"" and ""One for me & One for my buddy"" will have the same number of limited items. So, for example; ""Early Birds"" pledge: 50 will be available for paypal & 50 will be available for credit cards (100 items in total). However, the ""In Game Cameo"" pledge will only have 1 available spot for paypal due to the original available spot is an odd number; 3.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Crowdfunding</h2>
<div>
<p>I've been working as a game designer for over a <strong>decade</strong>, working on all sorts of games of different shapes and sizes, but always for someone else (a boss, a client, an investor). I was itching to create a game I could call my own, and after a long time of chipping away at weird experiments during afternoons and weekends, I found a concept that had tons of potential: <strong>Being a secret society</strong>.</p>
<p>Starting small, it grew step by step; from a board game version, to a digital prototype to a demo I could test with others.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602597514/l9taucmrx9xnbygpvoji.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>An early digital prototype of the game</i></p>
<p>For a few months, it lived as a prototype, continuously being worked on and shown at local Vancouver game events. It grew slowly from there, as the <strong>constant community playtesting</strong> and feedback proved invaluable to <strong>refine the gameplay</strong>.</p>
<p>Eventually it evolved to a point of polish where I realized this could be an actual, complete game! I'm really happy with the way the game is shaping up, but the final vision for it is much grander! I made a crowdfunding campaign to help raise funding to support the <strong>final stretch of development</strong>. The game has come a long way to the playable state it is currently in, but its only a fraction of what I hope to include in the final product.  Now, with the extra funding from the community, I am able to finish the remaining features, improve the art quality and release the full game on <strong>Steam</strong>.</p>
<p>The second reason for the campaign is to be judged by the community. You, the players, know what you want, and although I've worked really hard to prepare the game, I know there's much more to be done. I want your feedback, I want your insight, but most of all, I want to know if this is a concept you're interested in. The feedback on new features that are being planned will keep me on the right path and, with the help of the community, we'll create the amazing game that we have always dreamed of playing.</p>

I will be the first to acknowledge that there's a lot of things that can go wrong (technical issues, balance, dealing with platforms, etc...) and these can push back a project. My 10 years experience making games has shown me this again and again. But through those years I've gained a lot of experience to help me push through the obstacles in my path and to get help from other industry professionals for those that I can't handle alone. What I can promise you is that I'll keep the communication channels open and that you and the community will be the first to know what the game state is. I'll send regular updates and answer as many questions as I can to make sure that we got transparency above all.

Two teams of 5 players battle it out with the help of minions. Explore different abilities and strategies to crown your team victorious. Revn has no set classes or heroes, and allows you to choose from 25+ abilities to form your own personal loadout.A New Kind of MOBARevn doesn't have traditional character classes or heroes to choose from. Instead, combine any abilities to create your own synergies.We've combined the teamwork and evolving meta of a MOBA with the fast paced action of a third person shooter. Player customization, fun moment-to-moment gameplay, and competitive integrity are some of our core design pillars.Revn already includes player profiles and stats, a robust replay system, an ELO-based skill rating system, bots, and an expanding API that we will be making public for third party developers.Customize your arsenalPlayers can modify their weapons with a wide range of attachments. We currently have 8 weapon classes, each with their own unique customization options.Choose from over 30 abilities and 17+ items. Level them up during the match to overpower your enemies. Construct your team's fortressDeploy a drone and place walls, turrets, force fields, and more to defend your Nexus. A strong defense can mean the difference between victory and defeat in Revn. Developer Blogs & Weekly PatchesTransparency is a core tenant of development at Project Ambitious Games. We post semi-monthly development blogs to our website, letting players know what we are working on. Our Discord server is always active and we love discussing games with players, and gathering feedback.We also pride ourselves on releasing a patch every week. We've released over 80 patches for Revn to date. You can see the patch notes for every single update here.What do we need funding for?We want to build dedicated servers for Revn. Dedicated servers will improve the gameplay experience for all players. We plan to use a cloud based solution such as Amazon GameLift. The funds we raise in this campaign should allow us to run dedicated servers for several months. If we exceed our goal, the development team will be able to work more hours. We all work part-time on Revn, with other jobs taking up much of our time every week.

<p><strong>Kinder World is a mobile game of houseplants, healing and practicing kindness.</strong> ❤️</p>
<p>Take care of your plants and yourself in a relaxing and lush atmosphere of your own design, completing daily acts of self-love that make the world a kinder place.</p>
<p>Players nurture their plants in-game by nurturing themselves in the real world, completing evidence-based wellbeing exercises like stretching, breathing, and expressing gratitude.</p>
<p>Practice showing kindness to others by sharing supportive messages and plant cuttings with other players in Kinder World.  Collective player choices like these, and in-game events will influence the growth of a shared Community Tree over time.</p>
<p>We're developing Kinder World to address the Kindness Gap. The overwhelming majority of us want to be kinder to ourselves, but don't know where to start. Kinder World breaks down the concept of 'self-kindness' into something accessible by pairing houseplant care gameplay with evidence-based activities. We’re using our experience as game developers in collaboration with psychologists like Harvard-based <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/tara-m-cousineau-boston-ma/164848"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. Tara Cousineau, PhD</a>, to create something evidence-backed, relaxing and accessible, helping us to be kind to ourselves and to others. </p>

<p>In a world where kindness can be hard to come by, we believe that each and every one of us has the capacity for compassion.</p>
<p>It’s only by nurturing ourselves, like a houseplant, that we can make the world a better place for all of us.</p>

The problem is we don’t know where to start, or many of us have tried and failed with more ‘traditional’ tools.

Take care of your plants and yourself in a relaxing and lush atmosphere of your own design, completing daily acts of self-love that make the world a kinder place.
Players nurture their plants in-game by nurturing themselves in the real world, completing evidence-based wellbeing exercises like stretching, breathing, and expressing gratitude.
Practice showing kindness to others by sharing supportive messages and plant cuttings with other players in Kinder World.  Collective player choices like these, and in-game events will influence the growth of a shared Community Tree over time.
We're developing Kinder World to address the Kindness Gap. The overwhelming majority of us want to be kinder to ourselves, but don't know where to start. Kinder World breaks down the concept of 'self-kindness' into something accessible by pairing houseplant care gameplay with evidence-based activities. We’re using our experience as game developers in collaboration with psychologists like Harvard-based Dr. Tara Cousineau, PhD, to create something evidence-backed, relaxing and accessible, helping us to be kind to ourselves and to others. 
 


In a world where kindness can be hard to come by, we believe that each and every one of us has the capacity for compassion.
It’s only by nurturing ourselves, like a houseplant, that we can make the world a better place for all of us.
With your support, we can work together to create a truly Kinder World. ❤️
 Gameplay in Kinder World is designed for a slower pace, without pressure or competition. Players water or fertilize their plants by doing a calming daily exercise of their choice, which depends on the plant species they’re caring for. We have designed Kinder World with you and your wellbeing in mind. Some of our influences include games like Animal Crossing, Neko Atsume, Tabikaeru (旅かえる) and Tsuki Adventure.Players can nurture three pillars of kindness in Kinder World:☘️ Yourself: Being kind to yourself
Nurture and grow a houseplant by practicing kind actions, such as a gratitude exercises
Every houseplant you grow will be uniquely yours through procedural generation
Customize and decorate your green space to create your ultimate personal relaxation zone
☘️ Community: Support each other in a kind community
Share your kindness journey with others, and support other players by sending community messages
Gift plant cuttings to friends and other players you meet in Kinder World
☘️ World: Being a part of a kinder world movement
Grow and nourish the Community Tree together
Have your say, and contribute to global charity events that make an impact in the real world
Have you seen Samy? Now you have! Samy is your friendly neighborhood guide in Kinder World, dropping by occasionally to keep you company and encourage you. Samy can also join your room for players who back the Cozy Pet Pack perk or higher - the perfect companion while you raise your plants! Practicing kindness should be a fun thing to do. The Kinder World vision is for players to grow and create their own personal lush paradise—the ultimate oasis of relaxation in your pocket. We want you to design your own world, and truly make it your own. Your support as a backer helps us work with artists and creators to create even more in-game items, like growable plants, pots and decorations.We’re excited to offer Unique Treat Pack backers completely one-of-a-kind plant pot designs that only they will have, and Luxury Pack  backers will receive a physical art print of one of their own houseplants, and have their favorite plant added as an in-game decoration for players to collect. Several of our reward perks also include special in-game items, such as plant pot designs from artists including Komomorebi, Maobaby, Rainylune, Cindy Xia, Bei Badgirl, Mayticks, Snowlattes, Morgan Meehan-Lam, Jisoupy and Meggy Vodušek! There are three ingredients that make Kinder World special:☘️  1. Learn and practice self-kindness in a fun and mindful wayOur vision for Kinder World comes from a lot of research and soul-searching.We’ve interviewed hundreds of folks, and an overwhelming 95% of us want to be kinder to ourselves. The problem is we don’t know where to start, or many of us have tried and failed with more ‘traditional’ tools. To address this gap, we’re using our experience as game developers to create something evidence-backed, relaxing and accessible, that helps us to be kind to ourselves and to others. Kinder World breaks down the concept of self-kindness into something accessible by pairing houseplant care gameplay with evidence-based activities, like gratitude exercises.  ☘️  2. Be surrounded by a kindness cultureOur unique approach with Kinder World brings community and interactivity together, through shared goals and values.Humans are social creatures. Through our previous work on the body acceptance game Body Posi, we validated that self-kindness is far more effective in a community setting. This makes our approach different to existing tools, which are generally solitary and disconnected experiences.☘️ 3. Enjoy building and caring for your personal plant paradiseAnd why the houseplant theme, you ask? We’re inspired by our personal experiences with them! Houseplants are the perfect way to slow down, to have a daily mindful moment, and to treat ourselves kindly. Real or digital, houseplants help people - so it’s no surprise that 2020 was the biggest year for houseplants yet!   We have partnered with kindness expert and Clinical Psychologist Dr Tara Cousineau (Ph.D) to ensure that our approach develops kindness for the self and others in measurable ways. The game design of Kinder World follows the PEPPIE framework (Presence, Emotion regulation, Perspective, Purpose, Integration and Effort) and other leading research to help players develop these skills. For further reading, we recommend Dr Cousineau's book The Kindness Cure.While playing Kinder World isn’t a replacement for therapy, our gameplay is designed as a good concrete practice alongside professional support. You can also tailor your in-game experience for where you’re at personally. In the future, we plan to add content and activities focused on stretching, relaxation skills, confidence, and more. The Community Tree is an in-game representation of the Kinder World community. As seasons change and events take place, the tree itself will change. Through supporting our Indiegogo campaign with the Kind Heart Pack or higher, you can contribute to messages that all players will see on the tree, and you can help us select charities that in-game Community Tree events will support. Backing Kinder World shows that you long for greater compassion for yourself and for others, just like we do.You’ll become the backbone of a unique kindness-focused community. Help us define what kindness means to you, and discover ways to bring kindness to the world through the game. By backing us you will directly inform our development and contribute to building a houseplant world that thrives on kindness. Our priority with this campaign is to connect with special people who care, like you. We can’t wait to meet you!If you are able to support our campaign now, Kinder World will also be able to grow to include rare plants, more customization items and new ways to be kind to each other. We will also be able to build more kindness learning resources and offer different in-game activities for players to enjoy together.Houseplant Care Cards preview!We're excited to share previews of the Houseplant Care Cards, a physical deck of mini cards including tips for raising your real life plant friends! These cards are available at the Plant Lover Pack perk and above. These designs aren't final, but we're excited to bring our past experience in designing card decks into Kinder World! Special Artist Pots add-ons!You can add special pots from our collab artists to your pledge! Take a look at a sample of pots from our collab artists, including pots by Maobaby, Cindy Xia, Mayticks, Morgan Meehan-Lam and Meggy Vodušek! Exclusive Backers-only Pot and Plant designs!Maobaby is the collaboration artist behind our adorable exclusive Flower Kitty Backer's Pot, and Meggy Vodušek created the gorgeous (and growable!) Dragon Tail Backer's Plant!Backers at the Basic Pack or higher will receive the exclusive pot, and backers at the Mother Nature perk or higher will also get the exclusive Dragon Tail plant in their game! To test our vision for Kinder World, we’ve already created a community that practices kindness together on Discord.We love the Kinder World community. Mimicking the eventual in-game community experience, our Discord members share daily messages of gratitude, kind words for one another, as well as sharing amazing ‘real life’ houseplant and pet pictures. We would love for you to join us. Being a part of the Kinder World community is a wonderful part of the game experience as well - with sneak peaks at the game’s development, special events outside of the game, and more. Already the community has shared hundreds of gratitude moments, and over two hundred kind wishes that are used in the game itself. To experience what it’s like, you can join the Kinder World Discord now! ❤️ Backers also get access to a special Backers Only channel for early sneak peeks at upcoming content! You can read more about Kinder World and the team in Gamespot, Pocket Gamer, Well Played, CBR.com, 25 Years Later, 148 Apps, Behind Gaming and more! Our all-female team is very diverse - we have migrant backgrounds, lived experiences as people of color, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and multilingual team members. We’re fun, smart, communicative and ambitious.   Lauren ClinnickLauren is the CEO, with a focus on Business Development, Marketing and Community Management. A lot of her time is spent with players, getting feedback and input on Kinder World, as well as trying to reach those who love the vision of the game as much as we do. She has previously worked in encryption, consumables marketing, and in the tech startup space. She has qualifications in Business and Arts, and her favorite houseplant is Monstera!Christina ChenChristina is the CTO on the team, and does technical work on the game - including coding, deployment (getting it out to players!) and technical production.

<h2><u><i>A Family Made Game</i></u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>During the Lockdowns of recent, My son and I , began working on 3d assets for sale, and then decided to use the experience around the industry to make a game, which has been an incredible bonding experience and amazing for his self confidence, as well as opening his eyes to the potential out there for him.</p>
<p><br/><u style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>THE GAME</strong></u></p>
<p>High paced and high scoring gaming stripped back to its arcade roots and set to a rocking and rolling soundtrack! <strong>Prepare for your new addiction!</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>Rock And Roll And Run And Gun!!</strong></u></p>
<p>In a terrifying future where the bugs have decided its high time they did the squishing, only one man can save us all! Enter Jock McFacepuncher, the size 1000 slipper to your 100xl arachnid...and as far as hes concerned, the only good bug, is a dead bug.</p>
<p>Old school arcade game mentality and modern Unreal powered presentation! Go back to a time before DLC, loot crates and seasons, a simpler time of pick up and play. Everything unlocked by accomplishing tasks in game. Simply beat your high score, beat your friends high scores, beat that rando on steams high score! The only thing you need to know is - where they are!</p>
<p>Accessible Gameplay : designed for pick up and play, jump in and play a quick session. Fast Paced: Optimised to allow many enemies to spawn in and start running around, the hunter can be the hunted at the turn of a corner, the only question is which are you?  clicking. </p>
<p>A return to old school shooting and scoring of the arcade games of yesteryear! <strong>As casual or hardcore as you wish!</strong></p>
<p>- A points based over the shoulder shooter, featuring giant bug enemies.

<p>With an initial release plan of 6 arenas, with more arenas added every 4-6 weeks, the plan is to keep the game up to date and fresh consistently and create an experience and community people feel they belong to!</p>
<p>We took the idea as with me being a working parent, and having a 4 year old as well, there wasn't that much for us to be able to just pick up and put down at will.

<p>As we made more contacts within the indie music industry, it also became apparent that making the game feel like a compilation of the best game dev musicians around, was an absolute must.</p>

Founded in 2020 and already backed by some of the world's best investors, Quell is the first game to offer you a high-intensity, full-body, resistance-based combat workout at home. Travel through an exciting fantasy world fighting enemies with your bare hands and get fit at the same time.  Each fight guides you through an effective workout tailored to your fitness goals. Just slip on the lightweight Gauntlet wearable and start in under a minute. You’ll feel every punch like it’s real, thanks to haptic technology, customisable resistance, and high-performance motion tracking.  In the game, you’ll fight a huge range of challenging foes, with every fight designed to guide you through a fun, rigorous workout tailored to your goals and current skill level. No combat experience required.  After each fight, you’ll be able to see how you’re improving through clear metrics such as calories burned, punch speed, strength, and accuracy. You can also track your progress long term through benchmarking and tailored recommendations. We believe that fitness games should be serious about fitness. Each session with Quell burns more calories than running, cycling, or a spin class.  We’re committed to delivering effective full-body exercise and have created a number of lower body, core, and cardio exercises alongside the core combat experience to give you a totally balanced workout. As passionate gamers, we know that the game is just as important as the exercise. This is a real game—not a boxing simulator.  In Quell, you’ll discover a huge variety of environments and a rich, fully-fledged story. Our team of artists and developers are building a brand new world bursting with exciting characters and experiences. We know that variety is key to keeping exercise exciting—discover dozens of enemies with a massive range of combat styles.  No two fights are exactly alike—you’ll have to think, improve and adapt to succeed. Punch, block, dodge, and cast spells to train your body and survive the challenges ahead. As you and your character grow stronger, you’ll take on tougher challenges to earn exciting new moves and equipment.  Exercise is about commitment over time, and the game needs to support that with endless replayability. Quell will keep things fresh through regular quests and events, procedurally generated enemies, and a massive range of exciting rewards. We plan to support and improve the game for many years, with new content in response to player feedback.The Gauntlet wearable is the secret to Quell’s immersiveness and exercise impact, and was designed in consultation with professional boxers, physiotherapists, and athletes. Our Gauntlet is also super lightweight, making it portable and travel-friendly. Extreme sports-grade resistance can be set to a difficulty level that suits you. The Gauntlet removes all the hassle of a punchbag and is much more satisfying and effective than shadowboxing. Resistance massively boosts the efficiency of your workout and helps you build muscular power and endurance. As you get stronger, simply upgrade your bands to keep the difficulty right for you. You asked, and we delivered—haptics are coming to Quell! We’ve partnered with the experts at Nanoport Technology, and have been developing Quell to feature their revolutionary TacHammer™ haptics.  Forget game controllers, smartphones, and the rest—the TacHammer™ units deliver up to 25G of impact with a latency of less than 1ms. This kicks in as you land each move, letting you feel the satisfying, physical feedback and resistance of a real punch. Their unique design allows for subtle effects such as clicks, pulses, and more. Real punches, anywhere. This is feedback on a new level. High-precision motion sensors track your attacks, blocks, dodges, and spells in real-time. This data is sent wirelessly to your device with ultra-low latency, keeping you fully immersed in the action. Our high-accuracy motion capture means that you don’t need to set up any cameras or other equipment. We are fully committed to making Quell accessible to as many people as possible. Our designers have been working on a design that can fit a range of body types, ensuring Quell can be played by all shapes and sizes. It doesn’t matter where you are in your fitness journey—Quell is here to make everyone’s ride worthwhile.  Our users have told us time and time again that even seemingly small obstacles are killers when it comes to maintaining a solid workout routine. That’s why we designed Quell to remove all the barriers of normal exercise, so you can get a complete workout at home without worrying about bad weather, travel time, sharing equipment, and planning your workout. Exercise is more fun with friends.

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Remember the first home computers from 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>This is your chance to experience these amazing machines again!</p>
<p>Would you like to collect all the iconic Retro Computers and learn how to use them?<br/>or<br/>Would you simply like to play games or practice old-school coding?</p>
<p>Breadbox is the first retro computer simulator to bring fully working vintage computers to your desktop.</p>
<p>Yes, it can simulate multiple real life retro computers in a highly realistic and accurate way. It literally brings a new dimension compared to emulators. And, because it is all software, you don’t have all the problems related to real hardware either, it will not take space, nor will it contain components that may break.</p>
<p>Do not let the term <i>simulator</i> to distract you. This is, as real as it can, as you will see. Breadbox brings so much more to the table. Or should we say... to your desktop.</p>
<p>It really can bring Retro Computers to the masses!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617644031/unvpjlphfauvolnmqk5t.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>In Depth</h3>
<p>Breadbox is created with latest Game Technology.</p>
<p>It contains a growing collection of fully functional – RUNNABLE – Retro Computers.</p>
<p>All computers and devices are interactable, beautifully rendered 3D models with realistic look, smooth animations, and authentic sounds.</p>
<p>Breadbox is designed to be user-friendly and easy to setup.<br/>Included tutorials will give everybody a good start into retro computing.</p>
<p>Of course, you need to learn how the retro computers itself work. That is where all the fun begins and that is one of the many reasons why you would want this.</p>
<p>Breadbox is not really a game; it is a simulator which allows you to use retro computers as if they were real.</p>
<p>Different kinds of software, including games, but also PDF copies of manuals can be easily added and used with it. Breadbox will recognize supported file formats of your digital copies and they will be available for you in the simulation.</p>
<p>Emulation plays a big part of Breadbox. You can of course, use Breadbox without emulators, and it will then behave like a hardware only simulator, which you cannot power on.</p>
<p>But, emulator is the engine, which enables the system to behave and run like the original computer. In Breadbox, a high-quality emulators are seamlessly integrated to give the best possible, authentic-like experience. But in general Breadbox emulation is as good as the emulator in use. For example, with current systems, we are using a special version of VICE, which is an excellent emulator for Commodore 8-bit computers.</p>
<p>First release of Breadbox will contain three iconic computers:<br/>Commodore PET-2001, VIC-20 and Commodore 64, all with essential peripheral devices.</p>
<p>But that is only the beginning, in time Breadbox will grow. New models will be added, one by one. Without extra charge!</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Just Imagine it, the possibility to have ALL vintage computers, on your PC.</p>
<p>What model would you like to try out tomorrow?<br/>Apple IIe, Atari 400, TI-99/4A, ZX Spectrum, SVI-728 or BBC Micro, just to mention few.</p>
<p>Vision of The Breadbox is not only to include the most famous home computers, but literally all of them. And if the vision comes true, why should we stop at home computers!</p>
<p>We hope to bring Breadbox also to macOS and Linux.</p>
<p>Virtual Reality, of course!</p>
<p>And lots of other great ideas.</p>
<p>Eventually we would like to say: Breadbox IS preserving Computer History.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Note, that these features are long-term plans for Breadbox and will not be delivered in the first release.</p>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>Breadbox works with desktop PC or capable Laptop with graphics card and Windows 10 Operating System.</p>
<p>At this point, where the product is not ready and it has not been tested on many setups, it is too early to say exact minimum system requirements. But it will work both on Intel and AMD CPUs, GeForce and Radeon graphics cards. Breadbox has been demonstrated on a laptop (Intel i7-8550U @ 1.8GHz, 32 GB RAM and NVIDIA MTX150) and it performed well.</p>
<p>Recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit OS required)</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every project has risks, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>But let’s remember, this is a software project. It will not have same challenges compared to manufacturing and supplying hardware products.</p>
<p>There are different opinions for biggest risks in software projects. But in general, the commonly acknowledged top risks are poor project planning, inaccurate work estimates, budget changes, and technical challenges.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Project and work estimations</strong></p>
<p>We realize the importance of project planning and work estimations. And all that needs to be re-evaluated if this campaign is successful. The project and estimations depend on the budget. Current plans were calculated using minimum goal of this campaign. But as you realize, the actual budget will be available only after the campaign is over. Project planning and work estimations are not new to us and as this project is already on going, we have a pretty good view on the specifics related to this project.<br/>Even with careful planning, there is a possibility that not all deliverables are ready on time. But good thing about software is that it is so dynamic, some less important features can be left out, to be delivered later.</p>
<p><strong>Budget and resources</strong></p>
<p>Resources are commonly tied to budget. Budget changes are an obvious risk for a project, especially when its running low. Breadbox is going on with a low budget already, but with dynamic team structure it isn’t really a problem.<br/>This crowdfunding campaign was created to raise the budget and get more resources. Yet keeping the project team as dynamic as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Technical challenges</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to start this campaign only after we are content with our technical quality. This whole project would not have been started in a first place, if we had not solved the first and biggest technical challenge. Then we have slowly been improving the solution and tackled some other essential issues. Breadbox already runs great and there are no significant issues we know of.<br/>Software development is a problem-solving craft by nature, and it would be incompetent to say that there are no more challenges ahead. But currently we do not see any major obstacles in our way.</p>

</div></div>","About
Remember the first home computers from 70s and 80s.
This is your chance to experience these amazing machines again!
Would you like to collect all the iconic Retro Computers and learn how to use them?orWould you simply like to play games or practice old-school coding?
Breadbox is the first retro computer simulator to bring fully working vintage computers to your desktop.
Yes, it can simulate multiple real life retro computers in a highly realistic and accurate way. It literally brings a new dimension compared to emulators. And, because it is all software, you don’t have all the problems related to real hardware either, it will not take space, nor will it contain components that may break.
Do not let the term simulator to distract you. This is, as real as it can, as you will see. Breadbox brings so much more to the table. Or should we say... to your desktop.
It really can bring Retro Computers to the masses!
 

 

In Depth
Breadbox is created with latest Game Technology.
It contains a growing collection of fully functional – RUNNABLE – Retro Computers.
All computers and devices are interactable, beautifully rendered 3D models with realistic look, smooth animations, and authentic sounds.
Breadbox is designed to be user-friendly and easy to setup.Included tutorials will give everybody a good start into retro computing.
Of course, you need to learn how the retro computers itself work. That is where all the fun begins and that is one of the many reasons why you would want this.
Breadbox is not really a game; it is a simulator which allows you to use retro computers as if they were real.
Different kinds of software, including games, but also PDF copies of manuals can be easily added and used with it. Breadbox will recognize supported file formats of your digital copies and they will be available for you in the simulation.
Emulation plays a big part of Breadbox. You can of course, use Breadbox without emulators, and it will then behave like a hardware only simulator, which you cannot power on.
But, emulator is the engine, which enables the system to behave and run like the original computer. In Breadbox, a high-quality emulators are seamlessly integrated to give the best possible, authentic-like experience. But in general Breadbox emulation is as good as the emulator in use. For example, with current systems, we are using a special version of VICE, which is an excellent emulator for Commodore 8-bit computers.
First release of Breadbox will contain three iconic computers:Commodore PET-2001, VIC-20 and Commodore 64, all with essential peripheral devices.
But that is only the beginning, in time Breadbox will grow. New models will be added, one by one. Without extra charge!

 

Vision
Just Imagine it, the possibility to have ALL vintage computers, on your PC.
What model would you like to try out tomorrow?Apple IIe, Atari 400, TI-99/4A, ZX Spectrum, SVI-728 or BBC Micro, just to mention few.
Vision of The Breadbox is not only to include the most famous home computers, but literally all of them. And if the vision comes true, why should we stop at home computers!
We hope to bring Breadbox also to macOS and Linux.
Virtual Reality, of course!
And lots of other great ideas.
Eventually we would like to say: Breadbox IS preserving Computer History.

 
Note, that these features are long-term plans for Breadbox and will not be delivered in the first release.
 

Goal
The goal of this pre-order campaign is to boost the development of Breadbox and finalize the first release into a high-quality product.
First release, priced at 59,99€, will be available in Steam and/or some other digital distribution service.
Estimated release date is October/November 2021.
The content we plan to deliver in the first release:

Three retro computers: Commodore PET 2001, VIC-20 and Commodore 64.
Essential peripherals and accessories like, monitor, disk drive, tape recorder, cassette, diskette, cartridge*, joystick* and manual**.
Interactivity for the key events like, power switch, keyboard presses, tape and diskette handling, joystick connections, cassette recorder and disk drive functions.
Interactions will contain animations and audio. Sound effects are recorded using authentic hardware.
Upgrades to current graphics and animations. We are happy how the product looks already, but we aim for visually more impressive look!
Out-of-the-box keyboard mappings, to at least US and UK keyboards.
Easy keyboard mapping customization, for all keyboard layouts.
Easy to follow tutorial mode and/or tutorial videos to show you how Breadbox works and how to start with the retro computers.
VICE-emulator integration and easy installation.
Download and install Breadbox from Steam and/or other digital distribution service.

 
* Some options do not apply to every model, so expect minor differences between models, for example PET 2001 does not support cartridges, so you will not see cartridge on Breadbox PET either.** Some objects are only available when you have relevant digital content, for example manual will not be available without a digital copy in PDF format.

This is the kind of mouse that will give players confidence and conviction in the device, allowing them to truly demonstrate their performance.
Shapes and sizes of custom-made mouse
Customization of switches, wheels, sole, lift-off distance, etc.
Choice of color and surface feel
Paid, permanent support
Left-handed people and special shape requests can be accommodated
A mouse that perfectly conforms to the shape of your hand and allows you to play more consistently and aim more delicately. 
The ideal mouse shape for people varies depending on the size of their hands and the way they hold the mouse.
Even if you feel that your current mouse is the best for your hand, you will naturally find something to complain about with a ready-made, one-size-fits-all mouse.
We want to provide you with the satisfaction by using a mouse that truly fits the shape of your hand, and the confidence to play with it.   One round trip of the mockup to finalize the shape.When you share your thought of your ideal mouse, please let us know what improvements you would like to make based on your current mouse so that we can visualize them more concretely.For example, make the right side of the mouse look like EC and the left side look like GPRO, shorten the overall length of FK, lower the butt of G704, etc.We will create a mock-up of your ideal mouse shape using modeling materials based on the image you provided.Once the mockup is completed, we will send you 2D images and 3D model data to compare with your current mouse.After receiving the shipped mockup, you can adjust it yourself, hold it in your hand, and when you are finally satisfied with the shape, send the mockup back to us!※Shipping costs will be covered by us, so there will no differences between countries or regions. There is no difference in product quality or ordering process between regions.※We will take thorough measures against coronavirus infection.We will adopt the same hygiene management system applied in restaurants.Specifically, it is as follows
Wear a mask when working.
When working we will wash our hands thoroughly with soap and disinfect our hands with alcohol.
Before using equipment to cut mock-ups, clean the equipment and soak it in sanitizer for several hours.
Abundant customization elementsSurface coatingThere are two types of surfaces, glossy and matte, and two basic colors, white and black, for a total of four choices.Mouse wheelWheel:Due to the difference in the bearings attached to the wheel encoders, the sensation of wheel rotation will be different. You can choose the option to make the wheel rotation smoother or harder according to your preference.Wheel ring:We have prepared three different textures for the mouse wheel ring so that each user can choose the most suitable one for their hand. You can choose silicone/rubber/plastic wheel material.SwitchClick feeling:OMRON, HUANO, GM, ZIPPY, and C&K switches with different click sensations are available, allowing you to customize, for example, the left click of the main button to OMRON and the right click to GM. The feel of the click depends not only on the microswitch, but also on the position of the finger and its relationship to the switch. The combination of the shell design and the switch provides a click feel that suits various styles.Swappable switches:In addition to the pre-installed switches, users can also use their own switches to try out the new click feeling. Wired/WirelessIn the authenticated area, wireless can be selected. Wired uses a very soft paracord, which also gives the advantage of being lighter than wireless. At least, the crowdfunded wireless mouse will be available in Japan, USA, EU, EFTA, and Turkey.SensorAdjustable Lift Off Distance:If the lift off distance is too high, it will be annoying when you lift the mouse and turn it around, and if it is too low, it will not be stable depending on the softness of the mouse pad. It can be adjusted in 0.1mm increments to get that balance. Also, we will define the standard distance for LOD. Please use the standard distance if you do not have special requirements or if the above is difficult.Adjustable sensor position:When the sensor is placed on the fingertip side, it can transmit delicate lateral movements at the fingertips to the PC more directly. Placing it on the wrist side also dampens mouse movement and provides the same stability benefits as lower sensitivity. The position of the sensor can be adjusted Front/Mid/Rear as long as the dimensions of the board allow.Weight adjustmentIf you are not concerned about the lightest weight, you can adjust the overall weight and center of gravity.Mouse skatesThe gliding feel of the mouse is affected by the mouse skate shape and material. There are three types of shapes: all-over type, two-piece type, and four-piece type, and two types of materials: PTFE and UHPE. Mouse skates can be a combination of two-piece and four-piece types. For example, the fingertip side can be two-piece, and the wrist side can be four-piece, and so on. ※If, after using the product, you still want to change to a different customization, we have a support system in place that will help you do so for a fee. For example, if you want to change the sensor from front to mid, or if you want to increase the LOD by 1mm, we can try to meet your various needs.※Nitro Factory-Devices will set the standard options for you, so if you are not specific about a particular part, you can select it.Using the position of switches and sensors, and the center of gravity as examples.OMRON switches are the standard option (as they are commonly used in many gaming mice).For the sensor position, Mid is the standard option.The center of gravity is evenly distributed as a standard option.If you have any questions or concerns about the differences between the parts, please feel free to contact us via email or Twitter. We will inform you of our development progress at least once every two weeks.We will send you information on the progress of the construction of the website, updates, component verification to maximize product quality, and testing by testers.
For things that can be worked on in advance, such as communication for creating specifications and mockups, we will do so before March 2022.
​Delivery may be delayed due to supply stability of semiconductors and raw materials, or due to development reasons. 

Can be adapted by left-handed users
DPI can be changed via the button on the bottom of the mouse
There are three options for the center of gravity: forward, even, and backward.
There are many options available, but if you are not familiar with them, we will provide you with a website where you can send and receive e-mails and explanations about the parts so that you can decide the specifications with ease.
 Nitro Factory-devices is developing products with the top priority of realizing users' ideals and requests. If you have any problems or requests, even the most trivial ones, please feel free to let us know via Twitter or email. We will do our best to make it real. RISKSSpecifications are subject to change depending on the supply stability of semiconductors and raw materials.For example, it is possible that the high-end PixArt sensor equivalent to the PixArt PMW3370 will be used, depending on the circumstances of development and the stability of the supply of components.If the number of orders received is too small, we may not be able to sell the product to the general public after the crowdfunding, but we will deliver all orders received through the crowdfunding. ABOUT USNitro Factory-devicesA Japanese brand that develops exclusive gaming devices for eSportsThe first global release of a fully custom-made mouse, ""TypeDELTA""Project Planner: nucki (Taisei Onuki)Expertise: Precision mechanical design, product processingI have been working on precision machine design and production technology development for about 2 years, and have released several products and managed their quality and distribution.

表面塗装表面塗装は光沢とマットの2種類、基本色はホワイトとブラックの2種類で、合計4種類の選択肢があります。マウスホイールホイール:ホイールエンコーダーに取り付けられているベアリングの違いにより、ホイールの回転感覚が異なります。 お好みに応じて、ホイールの回転を滑らかにしたり、硬くしたりするオプションをお選びいただけます。ホイールリング:マウスホイールリングの質感を3種類用意し、それぞれのユーザーが自分の手に最適なものを選べるようにしました。 ホイールの素材は、シリコン/ゴム/プラスチックからお選びいただけます。またホイールリングの表面模様は4種類用意し、フラット/つぶつぶ/細かいボーダー/太いボーダーから選ぶことができます。​​スイッチクリック感:クリック感の異なるOMRON、HUANO、GM、ZIPPY、C&Kのスイッチが用意されており、例えばメインボタンの左クリックをOMRONに、右クリックをGMにというようなカスタマイズが可能です。また、クリック感はマイクロスイッチだけでなく、指の位置やスイッチとの関係によっても異なります。シェルのデザインとスイッチの組み合わせにより、さまざまなスタイルに合ったクリック感を実現しています。交換可能なスイッチ:プリインストールされたスイッチに加えて、ユーザーが手持ちのスイッチを使って、新しいクリック感を試すこともできます。有線/無線認証されたエリアでは、ワイヤレスが選択できます。有線は非常に柔らかいパラコードを使用しているため、無線よりも軽いというメリットもあります。 クラウドファンディングで調達したワイヤレスマウスは、少なくとも日本、アメリカ、EU、EFTA、トルコで販売される予定です。センサーリフトオフディスタンスの調整が可能:リフトオフディスタンスが高すぎると、マウスを持ち上げて振り向くときに煩わしく、低すぎるとマウスパッドの柔らかさによっては安定しないことがあります。そのバランスをとるために0.1mm単位で調整できるようになっています。また、LODの標準推奨距離をNitro Factory-devicesが定めます。特別な要望がない場合や、上記が難しい場合は、標準的な距離をご利用ください。センサー位置の調整:センサーを指先側に配置すると、指先の微妙な横方向の動きをよりダイレクトにPCに伝えることができます。また、手首側に配置すると、マウスの動きを減衰させ、感度を下げた場合と同様の安定感を得ることができます。センサーの位置は、基板の寸法が許す限り、Front/Mid/Rearに調整可能です。重量調整最軽量にこだわらなければ、重量や重心位置を調整することができます。マウスソールマウスの滑走感は、マウススケートの形状と素材に影響されます。形状には「全面ソール」「ツーピースタイプ」「フォーピースタイプ」の3種類があり、素材には2種類あります。 PTFE」と「UHPE」です。マウススケートは、ツーピースタイプとフォーピースタイプの組み合わせが可能です。例えば、指先側はツーピース、手首側はフォーピースといった具合です。 ※製品の使用後にやっぱり別のカスタムに変更したいという場合は、有償で変更できるサポート体制を整えています。 例えば、センサーをフロントからミッドに変更したい、LODを1mm上げたいなど、様々なご要望にお応えできるようにしています。※カスタマイズ出来るところが多すぎて何を選べばいいかわからない、と感じる方もおられると思います。Nitro Factory-devicesが標準オプションを定めますので、特定のパーツに特にこだわりがないという方はそちらをご利用ください。例えば、スイッチやセンサーの位置,重心位置を例に挙げますと、スイッチはOMRON製が標準オプション(多くのゲーミングマウスで一般的に採用されているため）センサーの位置はMidが標準オプション重心位置は均等配置が標準オプションという風に、こちらが標準オプションを用意いたしますので、ご安心ください。また、パーツの違いなどに関する質問や悩んでいることがございましたらメールやTwitterを通じて、丁寧にご回答いたします。プロトタイプ作成段階で、クレイモデリングから3Dスキャナー,3Dプリンタを使い、シェルを形成しました。クレイモデルを使用して形状を決めるという、全く新しいプロセスが有効な手段であるという確証がありあす。開発の進捗状況を２週間に最低1回以上お知らせいたしますホームページの構築やアップデート、製品クオリティを最大限高めるための部品検証,テスターによるテストなどの進捗情報をお届けいたします。
​仕様書を作るためのやり取りや、モックアップ作成のやり取りなど、前もって取り組むことができるものに関しては、2022年3月より前に行っていきます。
半導体や原材料の供給安定性または開発の都合により納期が遅れる可能性がございます 

左利きにも対応できます
DPIはマウス底面のボタンから変更
重心の位置は 前側/均等/後側 という3段階のオプションがあります
多数のオプションを用意していますが、よくわからないという方でも安心して仕様を決定できるように、メールのやり取りや、パーツに関する説明などを記載したサイトを用意しますので、ご安心ください

ユーザーの理想や要望を実現するということを最優先に、Nitro Factory-devicesは製品開発をしています。ほんの些細なことでも良いので悩んでいることや、要望がもしあれば、気兼ねなくTwitterやメールにてお知らせください。可能な限り実現に向けて取り組んでいきます。  RISKS
半導体や原材料の供給安定性により仕様を変更する可能性があります。例えば、開発上の都合や部品の供給安定性によってはPixArt PMW3370と同等のハイエンドpixartセンサーを搭載するといった可能性があります。
受注数が少なすぎた場合はクラウドファンディング以降の一般販売を行わない場合がありますが、クラウドファンディングでの受注分については全て納品させていただきます。

Each chapter will have 3 hours of gameplay and we will release those chapters one after another so that we can continue working on the project with the money we earn from selling the game chapter by chapter.Release dateDue to the complexity of the game and the whole game development process itself, it might transpire that we can't meet the set release date. Thorough project planning has already taken place but it can never remove the possibility of unexpected delays. Should this happen, we already have a plan to react to this. We already work a lot with freelancers, which allows us to easily scale the team up fast to reach different milestones. Of course, it can happen that we must still postpone the release but this will not be in terms of years. Should we need to postpone the game, our goal is to release within a time frame of 6 months after the initial release date.TrustWhen it comes to funding the project, trust from our community is a big factor. If we were to lose it, or should we be unable to build it, we won't get funded and the project will never come to life. To avoid this we are communicating always completely honest and transparent, that's why we have also prepared the demo for you to have a first look before investing money. We will also provide you guys with regular updates during the development process and even after release regarding the current state of the game and what we are working on. In that way, you will always know what is going on and what your money is being used for.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign
