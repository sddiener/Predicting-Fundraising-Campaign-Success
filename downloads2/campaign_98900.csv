<p>​We've built our prototypes. We’ve figured out our supply chain. We need your help to take the next step. We’re looking for funds to put Trāv-Elēr Originals into production and to generate revenue for mass advertising across the U.S. and worldwide with print advertising, radio, Internet, and even billboards. We know what we’re doing, so we know exactly what's required to get this product off the ground and to take it to beyond worldwide levels.<br/><br/>By backing up this campaign, you are getting in early, and getting a premium product ahead of everyone else at a much cheaper cost compared to the regular price. We would like to decrease the cost of producing the jacket by increasing our overall volume. We also want to produce more in house to control the cost and quality of the jacket. We would also use the funds to build an ecommerce website. <br/><br/>Some clothing products cost several hundred dollars, with some jackets even costing close to over $500, and they are not even custom. So with that said, we evaluated the cost and the time, to ensure that along with time and supply, we were able to develop a custom jacket at a beyond more than fair price with not only you in mind, but also cost in mind, with time also being considered.</p>
<p>Trāv-Elēr Originals jackets and hooded sweatshirts are not just another added collection to your wardrobe, but more so a statement, a story teller, and an item you will keep forever and even hand down to your children and even your grandchildren for generations to come.</p>

We started with less than $1,000 to produce a prototype and bring our vision to a reality. We were determined to create a travel jacket that would evolve with the our travel demographics and the needs of various diversified markets not only for travelers, but even also everyday people who felt the urge to have such an amazing jacket to reflect their own lives and fashionable look.
It is key to our growth that we use crowdfunding platforms to help us generate the funding necessary to scale as well as decrease cost of production in customizing our jackets.  We truly believe that focusing on our customers needs and the quality of our product is the best path forward.


The startup is looking for US$5,000 to start production. When we reach this goal, our immediate plan is purchase product in bulk so we can drastically reduce the cost of the jackets and the hooded sweatshirts.Right know, our average jacket and hooded sweatshirt prices range between $149-$349.We would like to sell and customize clothing in price ranges that anyone could afford while understanding that each jacket and hooded sweatshirt is custom made and unique to each individual which still requires dedicated time, resources, and supply needs.


Our guarantee of your backing and support:Each person who purchases a jacket perk will receive a jacket.Each person who purchases a hooded sweatshirt perk will receive a hooded sweatshirt.Each person who purchases a hat perk will receive a hat.Guaranteed.
 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 



To best way to determine your size, we recommend using your favorite hooded sweatshirt, fleece or jacket on a table to compare the measurements with ours. This will help to ensure the best fit. All jackets fit to size. Sizes available are small, medium, large and X-Large.
Every contribution will be spent fulfilling the orders of people who generously contributed to our campaign and mission, and once you purchase your jacket, a follow up email will be received so that we can get your listing of cities countries, states, or national parks that you would like to be added to your jacket.We look forward to providing an awesome keepsake that any global traveler would be proud to wear. 







Your contribution will help us promote the value and impact travel has in our lives as well as our communities. Travel is meant to expand ones level of acceptance and understanding. It thru these travel experiences that we become better versions of ourselves and become positive members of a global community.


​We've built our prototypes. We’ve figured out our supply chain. We need your help to take the next step. We’re looking for funds to put Trāv-Elēr Originals into production and to generate revenue for mass advertising across the U.S. and worldwide with print advertising, radio, Internet, and even billboards. We know what we’re doing, so we know exactly what's required to get this product off the ground and to take it to beyond worldwide levels.By backing up this campaign, you are getting in early, and getting a premium product ahead of everyone else at a much cheaper cost compared to the regular price. We would like to decrease the cost of producing the jacket by increasing our overall volume. We also want to produce more in house to control the cost and quality of the jacket. We would also use the funds to build an ecommerce website. Some clothing products cost several hundred dollars, with some jackets even costing close to over $500, and they are not even custom. So with that said, we evaluated the cost and the time, to ensure that along with time and supply, we were able to develop a custom jacket at a beyond more than fair price with not only you in mind, but also cost in mind, with time also being considered.
Trāv-Elēr Originals jackets and hooded sweatshirts are not just another added collection to your wardrobe, but more so a statement, a story teller, and an item you will keep forever and even hand down to your children and even your grandchildren for generations to come.

Center bolt placement is addictive and fun to fidget in 2 different holding positions. A traditional whistle produces a monotone high pitched sound to grab attention from the rescuer. However, a monotone sound can easily get lost in the wind. The GP1945 pen is integrated with a loud, up to 100 dB PRO whistle which is uniquely designed to produce a variety of tones to attract.  Adjust the vibration of the air by sliding your fingers along the pen clip air tunnel while blowing the whistle. It is also a simple musical instrument, a bird attractor to bring you extra fun when it is not serving as your rescuer.Finger rest area is precisely-machined with diamond knurling texture (AL). It is dimensioned thoughtfully for a comfortable and sturdy grip while providing a quick reference to measurements of the commonly used 1 inch” and 10 millimeters. Made of tungsten steel, the super compact glass breaker is on top of the GP1945 Pen. Different than the regular window breaker pen that has a narrow front. The GP 1945 has a sharp but safer and wider push away tip. When the tempered glass is breaking, the wider tip will push the fragments away from your hand in an emergency.​Additional $10 for a MG-CORE Fire Starter, make GP1945 your most compact survival EDC.The MG-CORE is always protected inside the GP1945 body, take it out only if you need the fire to warm you up in an emergency.The MG-Core can work with any hard edges or surfaces, including the steel tip on the top. *you don't have to scratch the pen body even on the Aluminum version.The GP-Grip PRO Special Edition is for Jeep Wrangler owners. Cast aluminum grab handle has 2 openings on the outer pouch to store your GP1945. And it is the only foldable handle that gives you a full window view, integrated with a secret inner pocket to store your cards and emergency money.Having passed a 4500 lbs Jeep Wrangler road test, the GP 1945 Bolt Action Aluminum Pen is tough built for lifetime use. The Titanium version is extraordinarily tough, stronger than gold. On top of that, the TC4 Titanium we hand-picked has much higher strength than the commonly used TA1 Titanium. Never lost your pen with our tight-fit pen clip. There are details we put into the GP1945 pen clip: 1. DYNAMIC to complement the overall GP1945 pen. 2. LOW profile, more integrated. 3. SMOOTH leading tip with a nice ramp. 4. More CONTACT surface notch to your pocket or notebook. 5. Two different heights to catch different thickness edges TIGHTLY. 6. Thickness INCREASED.The black ink refill size is compatible with LAMY M22, GPCA.us will continue to supply refills for online purchase worldwide.As your EDC champion, regardless you are a hard worker, nature explorer, outdoor adventurist, photographer, the CNC'ed Titanium or Aluminum GP 1945 will be your daily essential for many years to come.  READ MORE ABOUT THE GP1945 Bolt Action Pen on GIZMODO / YANKO DESIGN / TRENDHUNTER / BLESS THIS STUFF / HI CONSUMPTION /THAT'S DOPE / GEARMOOSE / SOLIDSMACK / EVERY DAY CARRY / EDC ZONE / GLOBOSURFER /",38.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>The combination of ‘Keep’ and ‘Robot’, Keepbo is a robotic device that serves to keep your loved ones and precious items safe and secure.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1192700/files/20150203044020-01.jpg?1422967220"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This high quality, effective device will keep track, locate and notify users the exact time and location information of the lost item or child in real time, using the Crowd GPS feature. With such a device with preventative measures included, users can feel rest assured when it comes to the safety of their valuables.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Keepbo can act as a universal remote control to activate various functions like using the camera, listening to music, as well as launching using the navigation app system by connecting to the user’s smartphone. This convenient feature gives users fast and easy access to various functions with just one click of a button.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Anti-Lost</h1>
<p>By attaching Keepbo to the subject (ie. a child, a pet, a bag, keys) users want to protect, users can check the distance and location of the subject using their smartphone. </p>
<p>Unlike other ordinary anti-lost trackers, when there is no signal for a certain period of time predefined according to your life-style, Keepbo automatically recognizes the situation and sends a notification to its host device. Fast and effective in the event of a lost item or child.</p>
<p>Keepbo automatically keeps track of the distance and location of the item and sends you alerts when you leave your item behind or in an emergency situation.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1195552/files/20150204040429-antilost_phone.jpg?1423051469"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When the subject with Keepbo attached and the user’s smartphone are detected to be in separation beyond the preset distance, an alert notification message will be sent out to the user’s smartphone, allowing for preventative measures to be taken in advance. If, for any reason, the alerts went unnoticed, the exact time and location of the latest signal will allow for fast tracking and retrieval.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Crowd GPS</h2>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1195475/files/20150204031642-Crowd_GPS_06.jpg?1423048602"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Connected to ALL Keepbo enabled smartphones, the Crowd GPS feature allows users to locate their Keepbo in real time.</p>
<p>Step 1: If the connection between the user’s Keepbo and their smartphone disconnects, it will automatically switch to Beacon mode.<br/>
Step 2: Once in Beacon Mode, ALL the Keepbo enabled smartphones connected to the Crowd GPS network will turn active and locate the missing subject.<br/>
Step 3: Once located, an alert message with time and location of the subject will be sent through the network.</p>
<p>More specifically, the Crowd GPS network works by reaching out to ALL Keepbo enabled smartphones nearby that are connected to the network, to help search for the missing subject. At the same time, the Keepbo device itself automatically recognizes it is lost and also reaches out back to the system. If any of the other Keepbo enabled smartphone comes in close proximity to the lost subject, the time and location information of the lost subject will be tracked and sent to the user.</p>
<p>Therefore, with Keepbo’s Crowd GPS feature, this system is truly effective in providing the necessary preventative measures and high quality tracking capability to keep what the user value most, safe and secure.</p>

<p>Keepbo has one physical button, which can operate three different actions depending on how users press it. There are three options: Click, Double Click, Hold. Each type of press automatically activates a different function such as using the camera, listening to music, launching the navigation app, and using the SOS feature. </p>
<p>The SOS feature instantly calls or messages the phone number, which has been preset, for help during emergencies. All with just a single click of a button! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Fun and Cute Accessory with Switchable Face</h1>
<p>With its creative and trendy design, Keepbo can also be a fun and fashionable accessory. Its ability to switch faces allows for you to customize it according to your needs and style. They come in various designs and ways to carry it, including as a necklace, a clip, or even a key chain.</p>

<p>The Buffalo Lodge Bicycle Resort Transformation Project is the beginning of something big! We are transforming this historic motor court motel into a resort for cyclists and adventurers while also inspiring people to follow their dreams, get outside, ride a bike, and live life's grand adventure. Join the movement of the #buffbiketribe by backing our project today!</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Phase 1 of the Transformation</b> includes: new paint in the rooms, linens, carpet/flooring and cycling- and adventurer-specific amenities in all rooms. Transforming the Buffalo Lodge into Colorado's first Bicycle Resort includes placing a bike rack in every rooms, bicycle-themed artwork and decor, adding comfy new pillows and finishes and unique amenities to cater to cyclists and adventurers. The vision for the bicycle lodge is to truly create ""your basecamp for adventure in the Pikes Peak Region."" This is only the beginning...</span></p>
<p>A local news station helps tell the story: <a href=""http://fox21news.com/2016/06/17/hotel-for-cyclists-becoming-a-reality/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://fox21news.com/2016/06/17/hotel-for-cyclists-becoming-a-reality/</a></p>
<p>Each of our 46 rooms and suites is unique, and with each we are creating a distinct look. We are looking for sponsors to help us design, build out and customize each room. We are transforming the outdated rooms to serve the comforts of our guests - world travelers, weekenders, cyclists, and life adventurers of all kinds.</p>
<p>The basic refresh of the rooms and the first phase of transformation to a Bicycle Resort is based on a $1,500 budget for each of our standard rooms and $3,000 for each of our suites. We already have the support of one of our best friends and designers, Valarie Day, who has agreed to refresh all the rooms with help of our volunteer work force and our current team. The current fundraising goal ($105,745) is based on refreshing 34 standard rooms and 12 suites and the cost for the fulfillment of jerseys, VIP reception, stickers and Indiegogo costs. The budget for each room, though small, is well-crafted and accounts for a margin of error and even loss of business days, construction costs, and materials.  </p>
<p>Essential maintenance issues will be tackled during the refresh to bring this historical hotel back to life. We've already been working hard to landscape, clean up the rooms and fix any latent maintenance, and we have hired a brilliant staff to give our guests the best experience from hello to farewell.</p>

<p>The long-term vision for the Bicycle Resort at Buffalo Lodge includes so much more than just new paint and decor. First, a patio and taproom off the southside of the lodge will provide a place for the community and guests to soak in the views of Pikes Peak and listen to our creek whispering close by. What a way to relax after a long ride or a great adventure! For your convenience, there'll be a bike washing and repair station and a rental fleet of fat bikes (we're working with our neighbors at Borealis - <a href=""https://www.fatbike.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.fatbike.com/</a> - on this!). On the north end of our property there's a recreation area where several small fire pits, picnic tables and an amphitheater and stage will allow us, upon build-out, to host local and regional bands and festivals. A full fitness center that will allow us to host cycling-specific clinics and workouts is also planned for the property, and there'll be a conference center and boardroom to host your business meetings.</p>
<p>We encourage the IndieGoGo community to reach out, give us feedback, ask questions or stop by for a tour! Send us an email: <a href=""http://mailto:%20bicycleresort@gmail.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bicycleresort@gmail.com</a> with the title <b>Bicycle Resort Tour.</b></p>
<p>We have a unique story (see below) and a passion not only for cycling, but people and our community. We are ambassadors for cycling, the Pikes Peak region, and most of all the belief we all can achieve our dreams if we are willing to chase them. Find out more about us on our Facebook page and join us in our journey: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BuffaloLodgeBicycleResort"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/BuffaloLodgeBicycleResort</a>.</p>

<p><b>$190,795: Complete build-out of outdoor patio and bar and refresh of all rooms</b></p>

<p>What better way to cap a long day of riding incredible trails with breathtaking views than with a Colorado brew and a relaxing place to soak in the vibes? Our taproom and patio will feature a stellar view of Pikes Peak, known as America's Mountain, a front-row seat to cyclists passing by on the Cycling Highway to Pikes Peak, cycling-themed decor and a feature fireplace you'll never want to leave. It will be featured prominently right off the lodge and be a gathering place for both hotel guests and our local community.  </p>
<p>We will serve Colorado brews and spirits. Did you know that Colorado Springs has more craft breweries than any other city in Colorado? We plan to feature as many local brews as possible, and we're working to engage local food trucks for tapas and other bites. </p>

Come visit, meet the team and back the vision of the Bicycle Resort.</p>
<p>The vision started a little over a year ago. There have been hundreds of conversations with friends and community and cycling advocates over more than a few cups of coffee and Colorado's famous brews. There are some wonderful hotels in Colorado Springs but none that caters specifically to the outdoor adventurer and especially the bicyclist. Our dreams, paired with a statewide bicycling campaign, Gov. John Hickenlooper's declarationthat Colorado will become the best state in the U.S.A. for cycling, and a realization of Outdoor Recreation as an economic driver, seemed the perfect storm and an inspiration to be a part of the transformation. </p>
<p>After scouring many inviting locales, developed or not, Torie learned the historic Buffalo Lodge was for sale and it seemed to perfectly fit her vision because of location, price, history and so much more. It was love at first sight. Although there were quite a few issues to secure the property and a few setbacks, Torie and her family (husband Nathan, daughter Delanie, and sons Levi and Daniel) closed June 17, 2016 with the plans for refreshing and transforming the Buffalo Lodge into a haven for cyclists and adventurers, and got straight to work!</p>

<p>With a large-scale project such as this one we understand there will always problems - in construction, especially in an older building, as well as the normal risks when hiring contractors or depending on volunteer labor. Our project budget is the bare minimum to refresh the rooms, but a margin is built in to ensure success. We have already engaged and gone through the bidding process for all of the projects, which is how we determined our budget.</p>

Room Inspiration (what we want to see)


The Buffalo Lodge Bicycle Resort Transformation Project is the beginning of something big! We are transforming this historic motor court motel into a resort for cyclists and adventurers while also inspiring people to follow their dreams, get outside, ride a bike, and live life's grand adventure. Join the movement of the #buffbiketribe by backing our project today!
Phase 1 of the Transformation includes: new paint in the rooms, linens, carpet/flooring and cycling- and adventurer-specific amenities in all rooms. Transforming the Buffalo Lodge into Colorado's first Bicycle Resort includes placing a bike rack in every rooms, bicycle-themed artwork and decor, adding comfy new pillows and finishes and unique amenities to cater to cyclists and adventurers. The vision for the bicycle lodge is to truly create ""your basecamp for adventure in the Pikes Peak Region."" This is only the beginning...
A local news station helps tell the story: http://fox21news.com/2016/06/17/hotel-for-cyclists-becoming-a-reality/
Each of our 46 rooms and suites is unique, and with each we are creating a distinct look. We are looking for sponsors to help us design, build out and customize each room. We are transforming the outdated rooms to serve the comforts of our guests - world travelers, weekenders, cyclists, and life adventurers of all kinds.
The basic refresh of the rooms and the first phase of transformation to a Bicycle Resort is based on a $1,500 budget for each of our standard rooms and $3,000 for each of our suites. We already have the support of one of our best friends and designers, Valarie Day, who has agreed to refresh all the rooms with help of our volunteer work force and our current team. The current fundraising goal ($105,745) is based on refreshing 34 standard rooms and 12 suites and the cost for the fulfillment of jerseys, VIP reception, stickers and Indiegogo costs. The budget for each room, though small, is well-crafted and accounts for a margin of error and even loss of business days, construction costs, and materials.  
Essential maintenance issues will be tackled during the refresh to bring this historical hotel back to life. We've already been working hard to landscape, clean up the rooms and fix any latent maintenance, and we have hired a brilliant staff to give our guests the best experience from hello to farewell.
More...the BIGGER Vision 
The long-term vision for the Bicycle Resort at Buffalo Lodge includes so much more than just new paint and decor. First, a patio and taproom off the southside of the lodge will provide a place for the community and guests to soak in the views of Pikes Peak and listen to our creek whispering close by. What a way to relax after a long ride or a great adventure! For your convenience, there'll be a bike washing and repair station and a rental fleet of fat bikes (we're working with our neighbors at Borealis - https://www.fatbike.com/ - on this!). On the north end of our property there's a recreation area where several small fire pits, picnic tables and an amphitheater and stage will allow us, upon build-out, to host local and regional bands and festivals. A full fitness center that will allow us to host cycling-specific clinics and workouts is also planned for the property, and there'll be a conference center and boardroom to host your business meetings.
We encourage the IndieGoGo community to reach out, give us feedback, ask questions or stop by for a tour! Send us an email: bicycleresort@gmail.com with the title Bicycle Resort Tour.
We have a unique story (see below) and a passion not only for cycling, but people and our community. We are ambassadors for cycling, the Pikes Peak region, and most of all the belief we all can achieve our dreams if we are willing to chase them. Find out more about us on our Facebook page and join us in our journey: https://www.facebook.com/BuffaloLodgeBicycleResort.
Details of our project, the team, the resort's current condition, and plans for the refresh can be found below in the Rewards section.
Visit our Pinterest board of inspiration for ideas of what we've been dreaming up for the resort's decor and design: https://www.pinterest.com/toriegiffin/bike-inn-ideas/
Also, see the media coverage section below for more information on the project.
Taproom and Patio-Stretch Goal #1-Phase 2
$190,795: Complete build-out of outdoor patio and bar and refresh of all rooms

 Taproom and Patio Aspirations
What better way to cap a long day of riding incredible trails with breathtaking views than with a Colorado brew and a relaxing place to soak in the vibes? Our taproom and patio will feature a stellar view of Pikes Peak, known as America's Mountain, a front-row seat to cyclists passing by on the Cycling Highway to Pikes Peak, cycling-themed decor and a feature fireplace you'll never want to leave. It will be featured prominently right off the lodge and be a gathering place for both hotel guests and our local community.  
We will serve Colorado brews and spirits. Did you know that Colorado Springs has more craft breweries than any other city in Colorado? We plan to feature as many local brews as possible, and we're working to engage local food trucks for tapas and other bites.

About the Buffalo Lodge
Neighboring Garden of the Gods (literally, the property backs up to the park), the Buffalo Lodge Bicycle Resort sports incredible views of Pikes Peak and is a quick ride from both downtown Manitou Springs and downtown Colorado Springs (try the safe and smooth Midland Trail!). We're adjacent to Colorado Avenue, a main street with boutique shopping and restaurants where historical Victorian-style homes line the streets. 
The Pikes Peak region is a mecca for mountain biking, with some of the best single track in Colorado, and the area sports hundreds of miles of road for the more asphalt-driven riders. (Other resources than links above: singletracks.com and COS Visitors Bureau or Trails.com.)
Location: 2 El Paso Blvd, Colorado Springs, CO 80904

 Google Map of Buffalo Lodge LocationThis 4-acre motor court motel was built in the 1930s and is famed to have hosted many of our country's famous figures including President Teddy Roosevelt. It has always been a haven for those seeking adventure and exploring the wonders of the Pikes Peak region - Garden of the Gods, Cave of the Winds, Pikes Peak, The North Pole, Cheyenne Canyon, hundreds of miles of world-class mountain biking and road trails, historic Rock Ledge Ranch, United States Olympic Committee and high-altitude Olympic Training Center, the U.S. Air Force Academy, unique museums (pioneer Colorado, Western mining, money, insects and more), art galleries, many incredible breweries and distilleries, and more. Soon, you can tour the official U.S. Olympic Museum and relive stunning moments in athletic history and achievement.
Since we took ownership of the Buffalo Lodge less than a month ago, we have already hosted families from around the world and played host to a multitude of community events including a rest station on the annual Starlight Spectacular bike ride. http://www.trailsandopenspaces.org/newsevents/starlight-spectacular/
We are a community gathering spot, a space to grow the local and international cycling community, and a place to share the passion we have for life, the outdoors, and people. ""Roll with us"" into the future for the next phase of the Buffalo Lodge Bicycle Resort! Please back our vision.

Support the vision of the Bicycle Resort at Buffalo Lodge. Pledge today and become part of the #buffbiketribe movement! ""Roll on"" and follow your dreams, inspire others to stay dedicated!


Your Impact 
This isn't just about a hotel and a haven for cyclists and adventurers. Your pledge will help to solidify the actions of believing in yourself, self-determination, following your dreams and inspiring others. 

What happens if we don't reach our goal?
We are in the process of refreshing every room and we're dedicating as much funding as possible to the endeavor. If we don't reach our goal the money raised still will go to further our renovations. All of the Rewards will be fulfilled for pledges and backers even if our goal is not reached.

Risks & Challenges

Challenges are something we faced at every step of the way to purchase the hotel. We are used to tackling them head on. Each and every obstacle, from investors to inspections, SBA loans and more, we've handled with a smile and community supporters working to make it happen. Problem solving and making things happen is second nature to us. 
With a large-scale project such as this one we understand there will always problems - in construction, especially in an older building, as well as the normal risks when hiring contractors or depending on volunteer labor. Our project budget is the bare minimum to refresh the rooms, but a margin is built in to ensure success. We have already engaged and gone through the bidding process for all of the projects, which is how we determined our budget.


Other Ways You Can Help
First, thank you so much to those who have helped already. There isn't enough space here to name you all. And thank you if you are considering pledging your support and backing the Bicycle Resort at Buffalo Lodge and the #buffbiketribe.
But you can help us even if you don't spend a time. How? Share this with your friends via Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, email or in person and ask people to back our efforts and to be inspired by the movement of the #buffbiketribe.
If you would like to help beyond backing us on IndieGoGo, you can always come and join our volunteer work days to clean up the hotel, paint, landscape, and tackle a myriad of other tasks. If you want to get involved, send us an email at bicycleresort@gmail.com
Thank you all!

<p>Hello, Heather here, co-creator of 32 Spokes. </p>
<p>First, I must admit, my pedal powered friend, ""Sue,"" is something of an exhibitionist. </p><p>She's blue and bold, and maintains quite a presence. I’ll be pedalling along, and through my ear buds, I’ll hear a horn honk, or someone will throw me a thumbs-up out the passenger window. She's a smile magnet, and spending a day roaming with her in the sunshine is pretty special. </p><p>I want to share that novel, carefree experience with others.</p>
<p>En route to the Sydney Boardwalk recently for a UIT (<a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Uhma Institute of Technology</a>) photo shoot, we were met with, ""Where can I get one of those?"" and ""Cool ride, can I try?"" by visitors from the docked cruise ship. Ally and her husband Mick from Queensland, Australia, featured below, were among them. The initial idea for 32 Spokes - a bike rental stand that offers low impact trikes and bike cruisers - emerged from conversations I had that day with curious passerbys and subsequent promising chats with other prospective customers, neighbors, friends, and community development champions.</p>

Hello, Heather here, co-creator of 32 Spokes. 
First, I must admit, my pedal powered friend, ""Sue,"" is something of an exhibitionist. She's blue and bold, and maintains quite a presence. I’ll be pedalling along, and through my ear buds, I’ll hear a horn honk, or someone will throw me a thumbs-up out the passenger window. She's a smile magnet, and spending a day roaming with her in the sunshine is pretty special. I want to share that novel, carefree experience with others.
En route to the Sydney Boardwalk recently for a UIT (Uhma Institute of Technology) photo shoot, we were met with, ""Where can I get one of those?"" and ""Cool ride, can I try?"" by visitors from the docked cruise ship. Ally and her husband Mick from Queensland, Australia, featured below, were among them. The initial idea for 32 Spokes - a bike rental stand that offers low impact trikes and bike cruisers - emerged from conversations I had that day with curious passerbys and subsequent promising chats with other prospective customers, neighbors, friends, and community development champions.

Since then, I've been giving alot more thought to the practical, cultural, and environmental benefits of establishing a bike rental stand. Many people have offered their suggestions to shape the experience. I'm encouraged by their enthusiasm.THE POSSIBILITIES:
To enhance the discovery experience by bike, a UIT cohort is developing a companion audio tour app. A bike sharing program and app is also being considered. Other friends have recommended the addition of pedal powered fun boats, colourful kites, picnic games, chess tables, and radio controlled model sailboats. I also envision providing specialty frozen fruit drinks, lemonade, and some retail. Unique twighlight events this summer are also in the works. I hope to partner with existing providers to offer beginner level kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding lessons that could be fun for cruise line passengers with a few hours to spare. I also hope to host an outdoor recreation gear swap for local islanders. Additionally, as a fan of innovations that have the potential to enrichen and extend recreation and fitness rituals to capture valuable data, I also envison carving out a spot for a recreational tech (RecTech) hub where leisure and technology intersect. 
The possibilities are endless and exciting. I invite YOU to be a part of shaping and realizing the 32 Spokes vision.
WHAT'S NEXT:In order to fast track the concept and launch the initial, lean phase of the experiment, this season, I'm reaching out to the community to raise a portion of the monetary startup support necessary to rollout by the end of June, 2015. I've secured an interim location with our partners at the Sydney Port Corporation eager to help us advance 32 Spokes.
Contributions secured from this campaign will secure low impact, cruiser trikes & cycles, bike locks, bike tracking devices, and Yakay helmets suitable for old and young alike. Funds raised will also offset the production cost of sponsorship/wayfinding signage, secure liability insurance, and support costs associated with local and regional partnership development.

<p> <i>“My hope
is to provide an innovative product that both professional and recreational
anglers alike can use to capture catch data that will ultimately improve their
fishing results.” -  Ben Arnold (founder)</i></p>
<h2><b>How it works</b></h2><p>Weigh the fish with the use of the <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Bluetooth® </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">enabled digital scale and with each
fish weighed the weight, time, date, temperature, and GPS location is
automatically saved and tracked via the mobile app.  Snap a quick picture with you mobile device
and if you choose release the catch or place him in your live well.  Once the catch is safely released, other
relevant information such as length, species, bait/lure, and fishing technique
is available so that you can capture other important details for easy tracking
and sharing.  With social media
compatibility, the ConnectScale will transform the way you share your fishing experiences
with friends. (For anglers who want to keep secret spots private from other anglers, the GPS
information is able to be set to private mode.) </span></p>

success grows we have plans to expand into key international markets such as
Europe, Australia, and Asia. </p>
<p>We also have plans for many more features, but the speed to
market of these features depends on the support funds we gain for the project. Further
innovations and app updates include:</p>
<p>-Fishing tournament integration. The ConnectScale technology will let even the smallest fishing tournaments have live leaderboards and fast scoring.</p><p>-Additional tools that help anglers
learn success patterns such as more detailed weather information and
automatically updating lunar tables.</p>
<p>-ConnectScale Saltwater model for a scale that can handle larger weight capacity and tough enough to endure
the rigors at sea.</p><p>-Expansion into more countries starting with Europe and Australia</p><p><i>Although our goal is to raise at least $25,000, the more money we raise, the more features we'll be able to add to the app. </i><br/></p><h1><br/></h1><h1>ConnectScale Referral Program</h1><p><b>START SHARING WITH FRIENDS, FAMILY, &amp; FISHING BUDDIES</b></p><div>

<h3><b>How ConnectScale began</b></h3><p>ConnectScale
Founder Ben Arnold is a MBA graduate of the University of Tennessee and has
over 10+ years professional experience in Consulting, Data Analytics, Process
Improvement, and Technology Program Management.  Drawing on years of experience during his
professional career, education, as well as his own fishing experience, Ben came
up with the idea of the ConnectScale one day when he was logging into an online
dashboard that tracked his family’s weight using a wireless weight scale in his
bathroom.  He started to wonder if this technology had been implemented in fishing.  After performing some research and finding that there was nothing currently available, Ben started think of the application.  The idea started to grow when

accompanying mobile app delivers a new fish scale and logging system that any
serious angler must have.
Gone are the tales of “the big fish” without proof or the
days of losing precious fishing time by weighing your catch and logging the
data manually. The ConnectScale’s technology creates an entirely new way to
record your fishing data and increase your fishing success. 
 “My hope
is to provide an innovative product that both professional and recreational
anglers alike can use to capture catch data that will ultimately improve their
fishing results.” -  Ben Arnold (founder)
How it worksWeigh the fish with the use of the Bluetooth® enabled digital scale and with each
fish weighed the weight, time, date, temperature, and GPS location is
automatically saved and tracked via the mobile app.  Snap a quick picture with you mobile device
and if you choose release the catch or place him in your live well.  Once the catch is safely released, other
relevant information such as length, species, bait/lure, and fishing technique
is available so that you can capture other important details for easy tracking
and sharing.  With social media
compatibility, the ConnectScale will transform the way you share your fishing experiences
with friends. (For anglers who want to keep secret spots private from other anglers, the GPS
information is able to be set to private mode.) 
Key Features
The ConnectScale- 
The App-




1)  Automatic data log of critical fishing information (weight, GPS, time, date, and temperature).2)  Ability to log additional data log including lure type, species, length, water temperature, fishing technique, waterway, and catch and release information. 

3)  Snap a photo and save a picture of your catch too! 
4)  Secure Login with full social media compatibility (Twitter and Facebook) to share your catches with one touch.
5)  Complete Cloud storage functionality allows log in and use via any network capable device with the app installed.
6)  Easy to access a summary of your catch history such as average catch, total weight, and amount of fish caught by lure type, waterway, and species.
Product Roadmap and Use of Funds
We started developing the scale in October 2014 and were able complete a working prototype and test app in February 2015.   The funds
we have already raised have been used to develop our prototype scale and Bluetooth test app, design elements of our app, and development of apps for both an iOS and
Android devices.  We are now at the point were we need the fishing and Indiegogo community to help
us bring the ConnectScale to market.  We are fully committed to this product and have selected Flexible funding to help fund the remaining steps.  The
funds raised from this Indiegogo campaign will be used towards the product’s Bluetooth
SIG qualification, FCC & CE testing and certifications, as
well as our minimum production order.   What does the future hold?
 Our initial focus is growth in the US and Canada, but as our product
success grows we have plans to expand into key international markets such as
Europe, Australia, and Asia. 
We also have plans for many more features, but the speed to
market of these features depends on the support funds we gain for the project. Further
innovations and app updates include:
-Fishing tournament integration. The ConnectScale technology will let even the smallest fishing tournaments have live leaderboards and fast scoring.-Additional tools that help anglers
learn success patterns such as more detailed weather information and
automatically updating lunar tables.
-ConnectScale Saltwater model for a scale that can handle larger weight capacity and tough enough to endure
the rigors at sea.-Expansion into more countries starting with Europe and AustraliaAlthough our goal is to raise at least $25,000, the more money we raise, the more features we'll be able to add to the app. ConnectScale Referral ProgramSTART SHARING WITH FRIENDS, FAMILY, & FISHING BUDDIES

</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote cite=""http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/""> I started to report and blog from Athens in spring of 2010 after the
horrible winter where international media started the Greek-bashing
campaign due to the huge debt and the economic collapse of Greece.
Having worked more than 25 years as a journalist and correspondent, I
thought “why should we, Greeks, allow international media report
about us and present Greek realities as they want to? We can do it by
ourselves!” And so  “Keep Talking, Greece” went live on internet. <br/>
<p>A few hesitant steps in the beginning, a few posts as I was
trying to pick up the thread… and then the tragic incidents
beginning in May 2010, when 3 bank employees lost their lives during
the first big anti-austerity protest. KTG reported with a live blog
from Athens bringing continuous updates on the tragic events. The
site collapsed due to the unprecedented number of visitors.</p>
<p>Every
time, I hit the nail on the head with some original reporting or some
reporting that was not in mainstream media and news agencies of the
English-speaking world,  the site collapsed - again and again.  To
make a long story short, altogether I had to change server more than
3 times and pay juicy amounts of money for have the archives safely
transferred. If it wasn’t  for Andreas, my “IT-guy” who spent
hours  to ”fix technical issues” and worked for KTG for an
awesome little amount of money…because he loves the idea of
supporting such a blog…. KTG would have ceased to function.</p>
<p>More
than 7,000 posts have been uploaded and more than 25,000 comments
have been posted by readers. Especially high is the traffic when
Greece is about to economically collapse, exit the Eurozone, exit the
Schengen zone and all these zones that occasionally make Greek life
so difficult. More than 3 million people –it can be also 5m-  have
visited KTG, with lots of them been registered as “returning
visitors”. 
</p>
<p>In
these five and a half years of reporting, I experienced a lot of
support from people I've never met. People who have been following
the blog right from the beginning. People I have never met and yet we
have a feeling of community or knowing each other. This is the  power
of the internet and social media. Real names do not matter. 5.5 years
ago, I had a bet with a friend that one can gain “credibility” even
if his name is XY. It is the brand that matters; it is the sense of
duty towards journalism, reporting without distorting, and the duty
towards the readers. This is all what matters, and that’s “Keep
Talking, Greece.”</p>
<p>Dozens
of main stream media and blogs have used KTG’s reports all these
years, among them <i>The Guardian</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i> and recently the
<i>New York Times</i>. Dozens of newspapers in Scandinavia and UK, and
Italy, France, Spain, USA, The Netherlands have quoted and linked to KTG.com.
Certainly for a good reason.</p>
<p>KTG
was the first to report for the English-speaking audience about this
unfortunate blond angel, Maria, the little Roma girl that was
apparently stolen. Famous chef Gordon Ramsey sought the aid of our
blog in order to track down British chefs in Greece. There are
hundreds of success stories all these years… I don’t keep
records. No time. I prefer reporting and blogging. 
And
make plans to offer more interactive tools to KTG readers, if it wasn’t for the
need of extra staff, of extra money.</p>
<p>All
these years I experienced a lot of joy due to people’s support and
positive feedback. Of course, during the hard “Greek times and the
Greek-bashing” I received also a lot of poison and insults. But the
people’s, my readers’ support was stronger and kept me going. And
I am grateful. But I cannot keep up the reporting and blogging
anymore if there is no material support by the readers and
supporters. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Annie, I started fashion study in high school in Vancouver and graduated college in Fashion Design and Technology Program in Canada. After obtaining an MBA in the UK, I launched the brand “ALPS Annie Ling”. I have passion in the apparel industry and wanted to offer affordable high quality new clothing experiences to people.</p>
<p>We are now developing this collection using nano silver ion technology with COOLMAX® yarn patented by INVISTA™ USA which have been tested and proven by the lab that the material can permanently eliminate 99% germs and bacteria.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534217004/bkewjesbbqa2qmqs3com.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When I learnt about this technology, I immediately wanted to develop a timeless high quality clothing line that could provide high protection against germs in everyday wear. This is  especially good for kid, elderly people or people who travels a lot. Traveling is fun but public places around the world may not have the cleanest environments. Travel exposes people to settings where there is a high rate of germ transfer, such as buses, trains, parks and theatre etc.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to support and keep this project alive, so that more people can enjoy and benefit the high protection from nowadays technology. We have made a lot of effort in sourcing, design and development; however, we are still a small emerging brand, we need enough support to commit the huge order minimum of material for production in order to keep the project continue. </p>
<p>Due to the high technology involved in making this permanent 99% germ killing material, the fabric lead-time is long (minimum 3 months) and the order minimum is high (5000y = around 5000 pcs of kid overcoat). After received the material, it is another 45 days of product production. We want to launch it faster and we made the fabric order already, but we need your support to keep this project going.</p>

<p>We have ordered the material 4 months ago, and have made the 5th proto on the products in the past 15 months. We have the material in hand and committed to deliver the products because we see the needs in the market and want to develop a fashion technology platform to provide more choices to people for better protect ourselves in style.  </p>
<p>Imagine the future we could be well protected by this technology and have less chance to get germs transmission, we could live more healthily. </p>
<p>Give yourself and your loved ones better protection with today's technology.</p>

<p>Silver is a highly effective, natural agent and has been proven safe to humans, animals, and plants. Tests have shown that on unprotected surfaces, bacteria can double in number every 20 minutes. Mitigating the effects of this rapid escalation, Silver ion technology inhibits bacterial growth by 99.94%. Silver ion technology resists and inhibits the growth of microorganisms by forming a protective surface against microbes, pathogens, and bacteria, such as E. coli and Staph. It also suppresses the growth of harmful mold, mildew, and fungus. Without bacteria, therefore without odor. </p>

My name is Annie, I started fashion study in high school in Vancouver and graduated college in Fashion Design and Technology Program in Canada. After obtaining an MBA in the UK, I launched the brand “ALPS Annie Ling”. I have passion in the apparel industry and wanted to offer affordable high quality new clothing experiences to people.
We are now developing this collection using nano silver ion technology with COOLMAX® yarn patented by INVISTA™ USA which have been tested and proven by the lab that the material can permanently eliminate 99% germs and bacteria.

When I learnt about this technology, I immediately wanted to develop a timeless high quality clothing line that could provide high protection against germs in everyday wear. This is  especially good for kid, elderly people or people who travels a lot. Traveling is fun but public places around the world may not have the cleanest environments. Travel exposes people to settings where there is a high rate of germ transfer, such as buses, trains, parks and theatre etc.

What We Need & What You Get
We need your help to support and keep this project alive, so that more people can enjoy and benefit the high protection from nowadays technology. We have made a lot of effort in sourcing, design and development; however, we are still a small emerging brand, we need enough support to commit the huge order minimum of material for production in order to keep the project continue. 
Due to the high technology involved in making this permanent 99% germ killing material, the fabric lead-time is long (minimum 3 months) and the order minimum is high (5000y = around 5000 pcs of kid overcoat). After received the material, it is another 45 days of product production. We want to launch it faster and we made the fabric order already, but we need your support to keep this project going.
 

We have ordered the material 4 months ago, and have made the 5th proto on the products in the past 15 months. We have the material in hand and committed to deliver the products because we see the needs in the market and want to develop a fashion technology platform to provide more choices to people for better protect ourselves in style.  
Imagine the future we could be well protected by this technology and have less chance to get germs transmission, we could live more healthily. 
Give yourself and your loved ones better protection with today's technology.


 

 


Silver is a highly effective, natural agent and has been proven safe to humans, animals, and plants. Tests have shown that on unprotected surfaces, bacteria can double in number every 20 minutes. Mitigating the effects of this rapid escalation, Silver ion technology inhibits bacterial growth by 99.94%. Silver ion technology resists and inhibits the growth of microorganisms by forming a protective surface against microbes, pathogens, and bacteria, such as E. coli and Staph. It also suppresses the growth of harmful mold, mildew, and fungus. Without bacteria, therefore without odor.

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>I'm Antonio Serna and I am the owner of a new business called The Wildlands. I go to school and work full time as a construction worker.</p>
<p>While this may seem boring and just an average lifestyle, I also have a passion for the outdoors and emergency preparedness. I view the outdoors as a fantastic escape from traditional life and urge people to take part in all and any outdoor recreation. However, the outdoors can be a dangerous place, which is why I am also including great emergency preparedness items in my store.</p>
<p>I want to create a website where all adventurers and survivalists can go to find the gear they need and can trust. This store will include items for all of your outdoor adventures, as well as prepping and survival gear. On top of that, customers will be able to rest easy buying from us because I will only sell items that I trust to get the job done.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise about $8,000 to get our store started up and running. This amount will help us cover any fees for starting a new business as well as stocking up a wide variety of inventory to provide for our customers.</p>
<p>In return for your generous contribution, we will give back to you with a Rewards Tier System, This can range anywhere from a 20% coupon to some sweet gear for you to take on your adventures.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Importance of This Site</h3>
<p>As you know, our store will act as a one-stop-shop for all adventurers and survivalists.</p>
<p>Throughout my years of outdoor recreation and prepping, I faced many challenges with finding the right gear with the right quality. I know that many other people out there face these same challenges, and I would like this project to make gear shopping an easier and more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>With your help, we can ensure that all our customers find the gear they need with the quality they expect. Even more so, with enough support, our team can also provide blogs and personal chats to help adventurers find exactly what they need.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>You may be asking yourself, ""Why would they need help starting a retail site? People do it all the time"". And you're absolutely right. However, between school and a full-time job, I simply can't fund this project alone. Between domain costs, licensing fees, and start-up inventory, a lot of funds will be going into this project.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I can assure that with your help, my team and I can push through any hurdles to help provide you with the products you need to help you and your friends get out and enjoy life!</p>

I'm Antonio Serna and I am the owner of a new business called The Wildlands. I go to school and work full time as a construction worker.
While this may seem boring and just an average lifestyle, I also have a passion for the outdoors and emergency preparedness. I view the outdoors as a fantastic escape from traditional life and urge people to take part in all and any outdoor recreation. However, the outdoors can be a dangerous place, which is why I am also including great emergency preparedness items in my store.
I want to create a website where all adventurers and survivalists can go to find the gear they need and can trust. This store will include items for all of your outdoor adventures, as well as prepping and survival gear. On top of that, customers will be able to rest easy buying from us because I will only sell items that I trust to get the job done.

Knife - Kickstarter exclusive.Throw it in your pocket or hang it on a belt, and then forget about it. You will remember this when you need it for everyday tasks, this knife withstands daily violence. Do not underestimate the size of this little miracle, it can cut very well regardless of its size, you can add this as part of your EDC.Risks and challengesAll production is carried out on our premises from A to Z, which allows us to control the timing of production. In any case, we will be transparent about the production process, and messages will be sent to all participants to track the parcels after they are sent. We worked long and hard to make sure that this knife exceeds all expectations, and we cannot wait to get it in your hands. Thanks for helping make this dream come true. We worked hard to ensure that we had the ​first-class production. It is extremely important to make sure that we have reliable production and reliable delivery times.",28.0,0,"8 Campaigns

<p>1. Introductie</p>
<p>Omdat Boxtel een lange geschiedenis heeft, is er in Boxtel veel te beleven en te ontdekken. Inmiddels bestaan er in Boxtel diverse musea en monumenten. Met dit nieuwe plan wordt de verpreiding en vertelling van de boxtelse geschiedenis op een nieuwe manier verwezenlijkt. Kortom, dit plan gaat verder dan alleen elektrisch varen op de Dommel door Boxtel in een fluisterbootje (zie figuur 1). De geschiedenis van Boxtel wordt namelijk in een fluisterbootje ten gehore gebracht aan de deelnemers. Onderzoek op historie, kunst &amp; cultuur, heemkunde en biotopen kan hiervoor tot een goed en mooi verhaal leiden. De vaartocht wordt nog extra versterkt door het verhaal via een koptelefoon of via een spreker te presenteren. Een dergelijke vaartocht kan op verschillende manieren geëxploiteerd worden. Daarvoor bestaat er een exploitatieplan met veel mogelijkheden. Het varen is mogelijk tussen Boxtel en Sint Oedenrode. Het exploitatievraagstuk wordt nog niet geheel opgelost en er bestaan nog vragen omtrent dit idee. Maar in goed overleg kan een realisatieplan gemaakt worden vanuit bestaande Boxtelse kringen. Denk hierbij aan Toeristisch platform Boxtel, Heemkundekring Boxtel, Brabants Landschap, Kunstroute De Rode Draad en Waterschap de Dommel. Inmiddels wordt in 2015 de eerste vaarbewegingen verwacht. Daarbij is de exploitatie en aanschaf van een elektrische sloep het hoofdonderwerp van dit plan.</p>
<p>2. Elektrisch varen in Boxtel</p>
<p>2.1 De Dommel door Boxtel</p>
<p>Het project Dommel door Boxtel van waterschap de Dommel is inmiddels afgerond. Deze rivier ziet er niet alleen prachtig uit, de functionaliteit op recreatie gebied is in sterke mate verbeterd. De rivier is geschikt geworden voor stille fluisterbootjes. Dit betreft dan de relatief “stille” elektrisch aangedreven fluisterbootjes en niet-gemotoriseerde bootjes. Met deze bootjes kan heen en weer gevaren worden tot sint Oedenrode en terug. Maar ook voor cultuurhistorische tochten kan in Boxtel bijvoorbeeld 1,5 uur gevaren worden. Onderweg wordt langs allerlei bezienswaardigheden gevaren. Ondanks dat de rivier geschikt is voor stille fluisterbootjes dient het vaarreglement in acht te worden genomen en met een klein vaarbewijs gevaren te worden.</p>
<p>2.2 De exploitatiemogelijkheden</p>
<p>Momenteel exploiteren diverse ondernemers en verenigingen verhuur van nietgemotoriseerde bootjes. Denk hierbij aan roeiboten, opblaasboten, kano’s en sups. De fluisterbootjes worden als toevoeging op deze Boxtelse activiteiten ingezet voor verhuur inclusief schipper. Daarvoor kan een elektrische platbodem sloep voor maximaal 12 personen uitkomst bieden. De exploitatie kan op verschillende manieren, waarbij de begroting de leidraad is. Op de volgende manieren kan de begroting gerealiseerd worden: · Eigen investeringen · Gemeentelijke ondersteuning · Crowdfunding (Social funding) Bovenstaande mogelijkheden tezamen kunnen leiden tot versterking en een goede startpositie voor dit plan. Dit plan kan voor een fluisterboot gerealiseerd worden. Inzet van vrijwilligers zou een uitweg kunnen bieden voor een sluitende exploitatiebegroting. De begroting omvat: a. Aanschaf elektrische platbodem boot maximaal 12 personen inclusief schipper. b. Uitgewerkt marketingplan voor de lange termijn. c. Onderzoek en realiseren van een begeleide vaartocht.</p>
<p>2.3 De voordelen voor Boxtel</p>
<p>Dit plan zal een aanwinst zijn voor de toeristische en recreatieve sector in Boxtel en het zet Boxtel nog meer op de kaart dan nu al het geval is; Denk hierbij aan versterking van het boxtelse centrum en daarbij het centrummanagement plan te versterken. Denk hierbij aan een verbrede doelgroep voor toerisme en recreëren in Boxtel. Denk hierbij aan de versterking van de “merken” Beleef Boxtel en Het groene woud. Bij crowdfunding wordt dit plan onder de mensen gebracht. Door een vaartocht aan te bieden in ruil voor funding onder een grote groep mensen (Crowd).</p>
<p>3. Ondernemingskeuzes, sloepen en exploitatie</p>
<p>Voor een elektrische sloep kunnen verschillende keuzes gemaakt worden. Het komt erop neer dat de volgende karakteristieken deze keuze bepalen:</p>
<p>· De vaarmogelijkheden op de rivier</p>
<p>o De watereigenschappen van de rivier</p>
<p>o De bodemeigenschappen van de rivier</p>
<p>o De doorgangen en meandering van de rivier</p>
<p>· De functionaliteit van de sloep</p>
<p>o De zitruimte op de sloep</p>
<p>o De wendbaarheid van de sloep</p>
<p>o De doorgang van de sloep</p>
<p>o De diepgang van de sloep</p>
<p>· De faciliteiten bij aanlegplaatsen</p>
<p>o Het opladen van de sloep</p>
<p>o Het wenden van de sloep</p>
<p>o De voorzieningen voor aanleggen</p>
<p>De vergelijking van diverse elektrische sloepen en de daarbij behorende begrotingen, kunnen voor 3 verschillende elektrische sloepen (capaciteit 12 personen) gemaakt worden.</p>
<p>Sloep: Prijs (ex. btw) Maximum motorvermogen:</p>
<p>ZWS-730 Elektrisch € 25.257,- of € 28.383,- ca. 4,0 kW</p>
<p>E-sloep 650 € 32.500,- ca. 7,5 kW</p>
<p>E-sloep 550 € 16.900,- ca. 3,5 kW</p>
<p>Inmiddels zijn bovenstaande sloepen in de praktijk uitgetest in Amsterdam en respectievelijk in Giethoorn. De kooponderhandelingen over de bovenstaande sloepen willen we spoedig starten.

<p>Remember those big and expensive coolers you used to carry when spending time outdoors? The ones that made the whole experience a bit uncomfortable and otherwise were mostly left in your garage to collect dust? And remember those other small coolers that were actually cheap and easy to carry, but you totally gave up on because they simply did not store all you needed to carry nor kept your drinks cold for very long? Awesome; now that you remembered both, feel free to forget all about them!</p>

The ones that made the whole experience a bit uncomfortable and otherwise were mostly left in your garage to collect dust? And remember those other small coolers that were actually cheap and easy to carry, but you totally gave up on because they simply did not store all you needed to carry nor kept your drinks cold for very long? Awesome; now that you remembered both, feel free to forget all about them!


TOURIT is proud to introduce the ZOOM Trailer, the multifunctional cooler/messenger bag. It will ensure your cooler is never forgotten in the garage and no food or beverage is left behind. As a cooler, the ZOOM Trailer is truly unique. It's designed to have huge storage capacity (it can fit 20 cans) while still compact enough for easy carrying. And the best part? It's designed to keep food and beverages cool for up to 24 hours with freeze packs.The ZOOM Trailer is an all-weather soft cooler utility bag that covers all your outdoor needs while meeting FDA requirements for food packaging.What’s more, with the ZOOM Trailer, one bag is all you need! As a messenger bag, you can easily use it to transport your laptop (it comes with a removable pouch to safely carry laptops up to 15.6 inches), documents, chargers, and other small items like granola bars so you can enjoy healthy snacks throughout your day!In fact, the ZOOM Trailer is so convenient as a messenger bag that it features a unique three-strap shoulder system that eases the burden on your shoulders while also allowing you to conveniently keep it to one side of your body. That's why the ZOOM Trailer is more than just a cooler, it's the perfect multifunctional bag for your everyday needs...... whether you're going to the office in the morning or you're heading to the gym in the afternoon.And as if that weren't enough, we've added even more storage to the ZOOM Trailer. The front pocket is actually a detachable fanny pack that can be used completely separately. Fanny packs have made an official comeback this year with convenient hands-free storage for jogging or exploring a new area without lugging around a giant bag. Because you never know where you’ll need to go or how you’ll need to get there, the ZOOM Trailer even comes with adjustable bicycle cruiser straps that make it ridiculously easy to attach to your bike. Whether for your commuting needs or outdoor recreation, taking this unique bag on your bike is as smart and easy as it gets!The adjustable bike straps aren't the only extra feature increasing capacity and versatility of the ZOOM Trailer. The bag's bottom straps allow you to easily take clothing, towels, and blankets to the beach and on camping and other short trips. The nature-lover in you will be very happy to know that the ZOOM Trailer is an eco-friendly bag. However, its environmentally-friendly nature does not compromise the bag's strength and durability, since the ZOOM Trailer is made with a durable and resistant TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) material, which means the bag can withstand scratching and folding without getting worn out.Did you know?-Between 100 and 200 billion pounds of plastic is manufactured annually-An estimated 10% of plastic ends up in the oceans every year-About 20% comes from ships and platforms in the sea -The remaining 80% comes from the land – garbage that travels through storm drains or watersheds and accumulates in streams, rivers, and bays.

 The Multi-Use DividerAs we said, you are in control. No matter if you want to cool all of your drinks & food in one big compartment or split the cooling tub into 2 separate cooling areas, the choice is up to you.If you decide not to use the divider you can conveniently store it inside PG20’s lid or you can use it as a chopping board for some last-minute chopping before your BBQ. Full Temperature ControlOur products are designed and developed for one purpose only: To make your life cooler, more convenient and less stressful.Only when you can live out your outdoor passion to the fullest, we did a good job. Simple as that.By using only the best quality compressors in the market (made in E.U.) we make sure you can not only enjoy a wide cooling temperature range of -8℉ to +50℉, but also select one of 5 preset cooling modes (low, medium, high, MAX, ECO).And the best thing? You don’t need to keep PG20 running 24/7. Thanks to our smart insulation technology, once fully cooled down to -8℉, PG20 will keep your drinks & food cool for up to 72 hrs before it reaches room temperature again. Pretty cool huh? MAX & ECO Cooling ModesIf you’re running late MAX mode can cool down your goods to -8℉ in only 15 mins. If you put PG20 into ECO mode you’ll keep saving energy (only 1kWh) and if you power PG20 via our PARAGO Power Bank you can keep cooling for up to 25 hrs! Maximum Convenience – Retractable Handle, Wheels & Interior LightLet’s face it. When summer’s calling probably the last thing you want to do is lifting heavy stuff around. Most portable coolers though don’t leave you another choice. PG20 is different. We care about your back and make backaches a thing of the past.Provided with robust and noise-free wheels and a retractable handle PG20 is as convenient to carry around as a small suitcase.You will probably not even notice PG20 having your back.The only thing you need to worry about is where to go next.With our in-built light you become master of time. If you should forget about time we are here to light your PG20 up no matter how dark it gets. Easy ChargingProviding you with the ultimate outdoor experience is our promise.By using the DC charging port on your PG20 you can charge PG20 either via our PARAGO Adapter or Power Bank.Both can be used to charge your PG20 either outdoor, in your car or at home.If you charge PG20 in your car or at home we recommend you to use the H2 (Medium) or H3 (High) mode in combination with our PARAGO adapter.You can connect the adapter conveniently to the cigarette lighter socket of your car.The length of the adapter cable is about 2.5m (8 ft 2 in) so you can store your PG20 in the trunk while connecting the other end of the adapter to the cigarette lighter socket of your car.   Outdoor Sports CompanionWe all know the importance of fitness to live a healthy lifestyle. While some of us prefer to exercise in a gym, others choose walking, jogging or playing an outdoor sport in nature. But what do all of them have in common? After a fulfilling yet exhausting sports session we all crave for a cold refreshment, no matter if water, an isotonic drink or a tasty beer. But let’s be honest. Who of us wants to drag their exhausted body to the next store to get their refreshment? Why don’t you just bring your own convenience store along with you? We know your feeling and we got your back, with our PG20 Portable Cooler. Camping BuddyIt's Friday afternoon and you’re counting the minutes to finally call it a day at work and get home. How about this weekend you escape the city’s rush together with your beloved ones & explore some wild nature instead? Whether it’s a road trip with your family, a BBQ with colleagues or a camping weekend with friends, we make sure that along the way your basic needs are met. We make spoiled food, warm drinks, melting ice cubes in your ordinary cooler a thing of the past. Our PG20 makes sure that your foods, drinks and even medicine are stored as cool as you want, for up to 72hrs! Just relax, lay back and we take care of the rest. Simple as that.    Emergency Override Function​If your car’s battery is running low PG20 will automatically shut into emergency override mode to shut down all non-essential features to protect your car battery. Your safety and convenience is our top priority.DurabilityIn our manufacturing hub in Shenzhen (China) we make sure to thoroughly test each individual PG20 before it gets delivered to you and your friends. Reliability is one of our 3 core values: Reliable Quality, Smart Solutions, Unique DesignAnti-Vibration TestingYou know it better. Sometimes the road to your pristine destination might be a bit bumpy. Your PG20 portable cooler comes with in-built anti-vibration protection, so don’t worry. Before we have delivered your PG20 to you we have thoroughly tested its resilience under extreme conditions for hours and hours to make sure bumpy roads will not affect PG20 in any way.Heat & Humidity Testing You decide where and when to go. So no matter if you’re traveling through hot-humid Florida or burning-dry Arizona, we have already put up your PG20 to the ultimate heat & humidity test.Retractable Handle & Wheels Testing*Actual Photos taken in our Manufacturing Hub   Power BankFor maximum outdoor comfort you can keep charging PG20 via our Power BankFully charged our Power Bank can charge your PG20 (H1 Mode) for up to 8 hours!By the way, you can use our Power Bank to also charge other external devices, such as your smart phone (type-C).Small-sized (a hand full) and slim (only 4.14lbs) our PARAGO Power Bank is a true mobile outdoor buddy. Heat Protect BagOur bag consists of 3 layers.

FAQ:What are the differences between AllBe1 and AllBe1 Plus?We have added the ""Last Known GPS"" which helps you in many life activities (e.g where I parked my car, where I lost my key and more) and we also have added the ""Hidden Audio Recording""By pushing on the AllBe1 button your phone will start recording the ambient audio without any visible sign on the phone.AllBe1 Plus is more accurate than the previous AllBe1 , In general they have the same sensors and all previous features.Will the former AllBe1 Backers benefit from the new app?Yes, they helped us make it happen and they deserve to have the new features. Just download the new app.What is the ""Extended Range"" mentioned in the campaign movie?AllBe1 Plus is a state-of-the-art design. We have added a power amplifier to the BLE, so the AllBe1 Plus responds significantly better than a regular BLE device (x 5-10 better).  
How does AllBe1 PLUS connected to my mobile phone and with which phone does it works?
It connects with a BLE (Bluetooth low energy) connection that is supported by iPhone 4 and up as well as various Android mobiles ( Samsung Galaxy S4 and up, LG G2 and up, Nexus 4 and up and many more devices) Does AllBe1 include a camera?No, it does not include a camera, but since AllBe1 is an open platform developers can use one of the sensors as a trigger for your smartphone camera.What is the battery operating time of AllBe1?Its depends on the user's profile. With average use, it remains charged for up to 2 months.  AllBe1 charges with a regular micro USB connector. Charging time is about 1 hourIs AllBe1 waterproof?It meets the IP-52 standard requirements. You can take a shower with it but you can't swim with it.What is a PIR sensor?PIR = Passive Infra Red, it’s a sensor that can feel the IR wavelength emitted by the human body. AllBe1 contains a PIR sensor that can detect the presence of humans if they are moving.How many AllBe1 devices can I connect to my mobile phone at the same time?Basically the BLE can support many devices connected at the same time. With the first release it will be able to support up to 6 units. We plan to upgrade it a few months later so  it will be able to connect to many more devices at the same time. How many AllBe1 features can work at the same time?All of the features can work simultaneously. Does AllBe1 include a GPS receiver?No. AllBe1 uses your Smartphone GPS to send your location, it use the mobile phone GPS. What can I do with the Smart  Button on the AllBe1?By pushing the button the AllBe1 will send an emergency SMS with your location and will call to a pre-set number. Sends GPS location to selected contact person, shortcuts to selected apps, a function of ""Find my Phone"". Also allows your smartphone to make a ""selfie"" picture  and start/stop hidden audio recording with your phone. How will I know when it is time to charge my AllBe1 capsule?Your Smartphone will alert you when the battery reaches 15% of capacity.  You have a capacity bar in the phone. With how many AllBe1 devices can one smartphone communicate?”6 AllBe1s, we will upgrade it later How do I pair AllBe1 with my smartphone?Pairing will be done from within the AllBe1 app. +  pressing on the button. No need to set the  Bluetooth menu on your phone. From within the smartphone app, you will only be able to pair with an AllBe1 that is very close to the phone. (About 1 foot or less). This will ensure that you only pair with your device. Does each AllBe1 have a unique ID?Yes. Each AllBe1 has its own MAC address. Is what I see on the video what I get?Basically, yes. However, since we made the videos, we’ve added more features such as the selfie pic, hidden audio recording and the kid in the car alert. We have removed the fitness feature.Also, we stopped the sale of the SDK protocol to developers.* *  Do you sell SDK to developers?In some cases yes. Please contact support for additional details 
Can multiple phones in my area connect to an AllBe1 capsule?
You can pair the AllBe1’s to many phones, and even see all the AllBe1’s in range on the radar screen from many phones at the same time, but only one phone can control all the AllBe1’s.   Is there any interference with or from other people's AllBe1’s?No. BLE protocol is designed to eliminate this possibility. What happens if the AllBe1 triggered an alarm when I’m out of the AllBe1 range?The AllBe1 will save the time when alarm triggered and show you on the app when you connect again to the AllBe1.",14.0,5,"6 Campaigns

</div> <div> <h3>Building Our Community</h3> <p>We hope that you've all enjoyed what we've produced at The Project so far and that you can feel confident that your funding will go 100% towards helping to sustain and develop what we've got on offer here.</p>
<p>As our fundamental purpose is to create an amazing community based venue and essentially a second home for all of our customers. We're really proud of what we've achieved with you so far and we'd like to build on this. We'll keep working hard to help introduce new people to our great range of sports and to help sustain everyone's passion. We think we've got an opportunity, with your help, to build one of the very best climbing centres in the world, not just in terms of facilities but also in terms of atmosphere and friendships.</p>
<p>The developments we're looking to bring you will help us to be able to set a greater range of climbs at all levels, from the easiest through to international level competition routes, specifically:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>New holds and volumes will help us to keep setting interesting, creative, technical and fun problems which will obviously directly benefit everyone!</li>
<li>Our new traversing wall will provide the ideal place to warm up, work on your footwork, improve your endurance and technique and, hopefully make the step up to climbing on our existing endurance boards.</li>
<li>Everyone can benefit from proper conditioning areas, even if it's just a space to have a little stretch or play around on the exercise balls - we're looking to mat out a bigger area (including the area around the pull up bars) with thin exercise mats, introduce some new exercise balls and balance kit as well as a load of other little goodies.</li>
<li>The big one is obviously building our new section of wall! We're looking to build what will be the second biggest competition wall in the UK currently (just as an interim fix, eventually we'll be building the biggest!) This won't just allow us to host events of national and international importance, it will also allow us to set some amazing problems on world class climbing walls for everyone who climbs here. If nothing else, it'll help to ease congestion a little on the walls so when you come in for your sessions you'll be able to move around a little more easily!</li>

<div>As climbers we all know Theodore Roosevelt had it right when he said those words and The Project is no different. It's been a whole lot of hard work to get us here and it'll require a whole lot more to keep us going and moving forwards. We've enjoyed every minute of it so far and your help and support has made all the difference. There are still challenges to be overcome, however, and your support will help us to know that what we're doing is valued and that we're well on the way to building a very successful community based project.</div>

  Building Our Community We hope that you've all enjoyed what we've produced at The Project so far and that you can feel confident that your funding will go 100% towards helping to sustain and develop what we've got on offer here.
As our fundamental purpose is to create an amazing community based venue and essentially a second home for all of our customers. We're really proud of what we've achieved with you so far and we'd like to build on this. We'll keep working hard to help introduce new people to our great range of sports and to help sustain everyone's passion. We think we've got an opportunity, with your help, to build one of the very best climbing centres in the world, not just in terms of facilities but also in terms of atmosphere and friendships.
The developments we're looking to bring you will help us to be able to set a greater range of climbs at all levels, from the easiest through to international level competition routes, specifically:


New holds and volumes will help us to keep setting interesting, creative, technical and fun problems which will obviously directly benefit everyone!
Our new traversing wall will provide the ideal place to warm up, work on your footwork, improve your endurance and technique and, hopefully make the step up to climbing on our existing endurance boards.
Everyone can benefit from proper conditioning areas, even if it's just a space to have a little stretch or play around on the exercise balls - we're looking to mat out a bigger area (including the area around the pull up bars) with thin exercise mats, introduce some new exercise balls and balance kit as well as a load of other little goodies.
The big one is obviously building our new section of wall! We're looking to build what will be the second biggest competition wall in the UK currently (just as an interim fix, eventually we'll be building the biggest!) This won't just allow us to host events of national and international importance, it will also allow us to set some amazing problems on world class climbing walls for everyone who climbs here. If nothing else, it'll help to ease congestion a little on the walls so when you come in for your sessions you'll be able to move around a little more easily!


 
“Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty…""
As climbers we all know Theodore Roosevelt had it right when he said those words and The Project is no different. It's been a whole lot of hard work to get us here and it'll require a whole lot more to keep us going and moving forwards. We've enjoyed every minute of it so far and your help and support has made all the difference. There are still challenges to be overcome, however, and your support will help us to know that what we're doing is valued and that we're well on the way to building a very successful community based project.

 That is why I want to ask you, if you like this but not buying, maybe you know a person who might be interested, please share this. 
And If you are buying, Thank you very much.",10.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>Outdoor enthusiasts! Campers! Fishermen! And anyone who plans on leaving their home at any point in the future! X-Bite is a patented anti-itch innovation that uses a dual action process to relieve your worst bug bites fast.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How it works:</strong></h2>
<p> 1. First, a <i>patented</i> ""X"" tip applicator is pressed into the bite - a scientifically proven method that displaces and weakens the potency of the insect's saliva. </p>
<p>2. Simultaneously, a powerful antihistamine ointment is applied through the tip directly onto the bite, providing relief and speeding the healing process.</p>
<p>This winning combination is the only one of its kind!</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Formula</strong></h2>
<p>Our formula combines the following ingredients for the most effective itch relief without the drying effect of some other relief products that contain ammonia.</p>

<p><strong>SMART DESIGN</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to make a product that would work for people who love being outside, from experienced campers to first time fishers. We've designed X Bite to be small, portable and sturdy so you can take it with you no matter where the summer takes you. Plus, with a modern sleek design, no matter what you're doing people will assume you know what you're doing. Even if you don't.</p>

<p>In addition to helping you enjoy your time outdoors, we want to do our part to fight mosquito borne illness.

<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>About the campaign:</strong></h2>
<p>After years of development, patent lawyers, meetings, phone calls, and incredibly long group chats we're finally ready to launch X-Bite and share our invention with the world. An invention that is fully patented by the USPTO office.  </p>

<h2><strong>Why your help is important to us:</strong></h2>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>After years of effort in making X-Bite a reality, we've encountered many challenges. Navigating the legalities of both patenting and trademarking a technology has been difficult, but we have accomplished just that.</p>
<p>Our next challenge is getting X-Bite produced in a responsible way that respects our desire to make a high quality, well designed product. Our biggest challenge now is getting a small run produced that passes the regulatory requirements of the FDA. We have found the right manufacturing partners to do just that.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>There are more than 300 million street lights around the world that cost more than 40 billion dollars to run. These lights release more than 100 million tons of carbon dioxide every year. (Carbon Dioxide is the main cause for Global Warming.) Sadly, still, billions of people do not have access to the power grid and public lights. Free and clean energy is all around us, but we do not have the right infrastructure in place to produce that energy.  We want to change that. And we have an idea on how to do it.</p>
<p>Our company, EngoPlanet is a clean tech startup from New York City. We have developed the World's  First Smart Street Light powered by footsteps and the sun. We combined two clean and free energy sources to provide light and electricity. We have installations in Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Saint Louis and Oman where people are benefiting from these free &amp; clean energy solutions.</p>

The risk is still there!”, etc. Those are some of the questions and feedback that we have received from several cyclists since we started with Blinkers. These are fair and serious concerns, and we have taken them very seriously.</p><p>To be able answer those questions, at the beginning of 2017 we started working with the Human Factors Engineering Laboratory of ETH (Swiss Institute of Technology) Zürich that specializes in product development, driving simulation, experimental design, photometry, and behavioral sciences.</p><p>Together with the Human Factors Engineering lab, we have designed three types of experiments in which we will invite a certain number of participants in order to evaluate the utility of Blinkers:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Visibility of direction indicators</strong> at various distances and under various traffic situations (daytime, night)</li>
<li>
<strong>Understandability of direction indicators and brake light</strong>: will car drivers notice and understand the light signals coming from Blinkers?</li>
<li>
<strong>Laser utility</strong>: will car drivers leave more space when overtaking a cyclist with Blinkers’ laser projection?</li>
</ul><p>In mid-March this year, we provided a set of Blinkers for the tests and experiments mentioned above and in May 2017, the HFE lab will deliver a report on the results of the experiments and include conclusions on the utility of Blinkers in view of improved traffic safety.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;'>Technical specifications</span></p><h3>

This successful campaign made us realize that Blinkers is something that people and cyclists want because it helps solving a very important problem: cyclist’s safety in the road. Since the completion of that campaign we have been working hard to craft a top quality product in terms of functionality, durability, price and design.</p><p>We partnered with <strong>Zuhlke</strong> Technology Group, a top Swiss Engineering Firm, with vast expertise in <strong>Manufacturing and Electronics</strong>, and <strong>Sapetti</strong>, a top <strong>design studio</strong>, to achieve those goals, and we are currently very close to have a final product: the electronic circuit design is complete (component selection &amp; PCB) and it only needs to be put into production; and the casing and the optics of Blinkers just need some small optimizations, but they are in the last steps of development.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/EcClN6R.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>So, as you read, the technical development is almost complete. At the same time, we are also in advanced conversations with manufacturing firms in Europe (mainly Germany and Spain) for the serial production of Blinkers: one that manufactures the tooling for the plastic parts, and another one that can produce the electronic circuit boards and assemble everything together. We have offers on the table, now we have to chose which one is the most suitable for us!</p><p>The reason why we are now coming to Indiegogo is very simple: we need more cash to finance the first production batch of Blinkers. Even though last year we raised capital from private investors, hardware development is very complex, cost intensive and requires a lot of upfront investment. The best way to overcome these financial challenges is with pre-orders, and a new crowdfunding campaign is the best option for us. And we believe that Indiegogo will allow us to attract even more backers.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/dxNGij9.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i><u>Delivery timeline</u></i></p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><h2>Who are we?</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490016444/m0guoro2qx8jsx3zct1p.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This is Velohub!

Also, Blinkers automatically turns on when you plug them in, so that you can start riding right away.Automatic switchYou can also recharge the battery with a micro USB cable. On top of that, the battery level will be displayed into the optical screen for 2 seconds after you plug in your cable.USB rechargeable---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Blinkers utility study: Is Blinkers making me safer?“Is this really solving a problem?”, “Am I actually going to be safer when I ride my bike?”, “Isn’t this just giving the feeling that I am safer? The risk is still there!”, etc. Those are some of the questions and feedback that we have received from several cyclists since we started with Blinkers. These are fair and serious concerns, and we have taken them very seriously.To be able answer those questions, at the beginning of 2017 we started working with the Human Factors Engineering Laboratory of ETH (Swiss Institute of Technology) Zürich that specializes in product development, driving simulation, experimental design, photometry, and behavioral sciences.Together with the Human Factors Engineering lab, we have designed three types of experiments in which we will invite a certain number of participants in order to evaluate the utility of Blinkers:

Visibility of direction indicators at various distances and under various traffic situations (daytime, night)

Understandability of direction indicators and brake light: will car drivers notice and understand the light signals coming from Blinkers?

Laser utility: will car drivers leave more space when overtaking a cyclist with Blinkers’ laser projection?
In mid-March this year, we provided a set of Blinkers for the tests and experiments mentioned above and in May 2017, the HFE lab will deliver a report on the results of the experiments and include conclusions on the utility of Blinkers in view of improved traffic safety.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Technical specifications
Water resistant​​​Is it raining outside? Snowing? No worries, you can still ride your bike with Blinkers. It is fully water resistant and complies with IP-64 standards of International Protecting Marking. BatteryYou don't want to charge your battery everyday? Every two days? Or even every week? No problem! Blinkers has a very powerful battery with a capacity of 3200mAh which will allow you to use it for as long as 2 weeks in a normal usage (2h riding per day). Light PowerIn dark conditions, cyclists need to see the road ahead, and city light is not always intense enough. Blinkers comes with a front white light having 100 lumens of power output, which will allow cars to see you and you to illuminate the road ahead. ​​​On the other hand, you want cars to see you from behind. Blinkers' rear red light has 30 lumens of power ouput and when the brake light is triggered, it goes up to 100 lumens.   Dimensions and WeightDimensions of BlinkersWeight of BlinkersBike mountsFront and Rear mountsBoth the rear (either under the saddle or in the rack) and the front mount only have to be fixed once onto the bike.The front mount can be fixed in any kind of handlebar between 22-31.8mm diameter.The saddle mount is fixed just right under the saddle, and can be fixed in almost every kind of bike.Types of saddlesThe rack mount can also be fixed in virtually every kind of racks: they often have fastening holes with standard measures at the back for red position lights. We have designed a mount which can be fastened to any of these standard holes with a pair of bolts and nuts.Rack with standard holes---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our perks---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Where we are and what we needBlinkers went live for the first time in June last year when we launched a Kickstarter campaign in which we raised +50’000€ from +500 backers. This successful campaign made us realize that Blinkers is something that people and cyclists want because it helps solving a very important problem: cyclist’s safety in the road. Since the completion of that campaign we have been working hard to craft a top quality product in terms of functionality, durability, price and design.We partnered with Zuhlke Technology Group, a top Swiss Engineering Firm, with vast expertise in Manufacturing and Electronics, and Sapetti, a top design studio, to achieve those goals, and we are currently very close to have a final product: the electronic circuit design is complete (component selection & PCB) and it only needs to be put into production; and the casing and the optics of Blinkers just need some small optimizations, but they are in the last steps of development.So, as you read, the technical development is almost complete. At the same time, we are also in advanced conversations with manufacturing firms in Europe (mainly Germany and Spain) for the serial production of Blinkers: one that manufactures the tooling for the plastic parts, and another one that can produce the electronic circuit boards and assemble everything together. We have offers on the table, now we have to chose which one is the most suitable for us!The reason why we are now coming to Indiegogo is very simple: we need more cash to finance the first production batch of Blinkers. Even though last year we raised capital from private investors, hardware development is very complex, cost intensive and requires a lot of upfront investment. The best way to overcome these financial challenges is with pre-orders, and a new crowdfunding campaign is the best option for us. And we believe that Indiegogo will allow us to attract even more backers.Delivery timeline---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Who are we?This is Velohub! A team of 5 young engineers and cyclists with the ambition of getting more and more people to hop on their bikes. Thanks to the countless kilometers in our bicycles and our backgrounds in mechanics, electronics and business, we have created Blinkers. But Velohub goes beyond that! Blinkers is only our first product...Velohub makes smart technology for cyclists. It’s in this last sentence where you can find our three main singularities:SmartWe build products that match our customer’s lives. Creating nice and smart designs that fit incredibly well on everybody’s bicycle.TechnologyTechnology is our passion and our daily subject of discussion, and we want to use it to improve not only cyclists safety, but also their riding experience.CyclistsWhy driving a car if we can ride a bicycle? Healthy, clean, fast, cheap and quiet. We know what it takes to be a cyclist and we always look for solutions to the problems we have.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Risks and ChallengesBlinkers is in its last steps of product development, so we have eliminated the main risks related to component selection and technical feasibility. Right now, we are preparing and planning the start-of-production by talking with manufacturers. The biggest risks here are lead times and supply chain risks: we are estimating reasonable lead times for manufacturing the tools, assembling the electronics components, and assembling the casing, the circuit board and the optics; but we are also very exposed to manufacturers delays.",25.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Once upon a time Saúl decided to become an artist...</p>
<p>He went to the university and studied performing arts. But he combined it with social sciences! D : This mix imploded in his head and made a mess.</p>
<p>One day he said: </p>

<p>We are not bringing art to the people. Our job is to promote the art they have inside and let them know that<strong> is not only about beauty</strong>. It's about touching your soul and <strong>changing the way you feel, think and act.</strong></p>
<p>It's let them know that <strong>art can be more than a hobby</strong>. It's a powerful tool they have in their hands. It can be leaded toward a cause... toward making a better world.</p>
<p>Also let know to parents that YES! <strong>Their children can be artists for living</strong> and that possibility must exist in the decision of ""what you're gonna when you grow up?"".</p>

<h3>2. Turning ""ART"" into ""ACT""</h3>

<p><i>Usually, the hardest part is <strong>""how to start?""</strong></i></p>
<p> ""What's your problem?"" is an artistic production we play in communities where we ask about the main issues the community is going through.</p>
<p>Then we offer our help to <strong>generate action plans</strong> in which they - by themselves - can <strong>solve their problems</strong> step by step. This is done through workshops using techniques such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project management</li>
<li>""Dragon Dreaming""</li>
<li>Popular education</li>
<li>Socio-cultural animation</li>
<li>Recreation</li>
<li>Theatre of the Oppressed</li>
</ul>
<p>By this way, communities become again in <strong>active agents of society</strong> at the time that <strong>self-management</strong> is promoted to fight social welfarism and government dependence.</p>

<p>Un día de tantos - hace mucho tiempo - Saúl decidió convertirse en artista...</p>
<p>Él fue a la universidad y estudió artes dramáticas. Pero lo combinó con ciencias sociales! D : Esta mezcla implosionó en su cabeza e hizo un desastre.</p>
<p>Hasta que un día él dijo: </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><strong>""¡Oh, necesito hacer algo por el mundo!... </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Pero soy sólo un artista. </strong></h3>
<h2><strong>¿Qué puedo hacer?""</strong></h2>
<div><strong><br/></strong></div>
<p>Así que decidió seguir adelante... e ir más allá de lo que el arte es actualmente (al menos para él). Dejó su casa</p>

</div></div>","ENGLISH ------------- ESPAÑOL_________________________________________________________________________ENGLISH_________________________________________________________________________First of all... give us a ""like"" in our Facebook site:https://www.facebook.com/Saúl-Demonio-233040980418562/And now here is...A brief explanation just for you ; ) 
Once upon a time Saúl decided to become an artist...
He went to the university and studied performing arts. But he combined it with social sciences! D : This mix imploded in his head and made a mess.
One day he said: 

""Oh, I need to do something for the world!... 
But I'm just an artist. 
What can I do?""

So he decided to move on... and go further of what art actually is (at least for him). He left his home

... and this is what he decided to do:

- 1 -
Take ""ART out of ART""
and keep the
ARTISTIC EXPERIENCE


The premise is art as a tool for social change and the artist as an active agent of society. Art has an impressive and powerful energy to move people... but its impact is very low because there is always locked in a ""hall"".
... It is time for the mountain of going to Mohammed.


- 2 -
Lead that experience
to
THE
S-T-R-E-E-T

The street is where it all happens. It is where the society becomes present, exchange ideas and evolves. Streets perform reality.
What if art became real too then?

- 3 - 
Let
COMMUNITIES 
be
ACTIVE AGENTS



In this real-living-theater-out of-theater spectators are called ""participants"" and this art-out of-art is like a lump of clay. Participants are invited to (must) touch it, play with it, make it their own, bring their part...
... And among all build a collective piece of art.


- 4 -
Build
SHARED EXPERIENCES
and raise
AWARENESS

The power of art lies in the emotions.
How much can you be touched by a piece of art?
Now how much can WE be touched by OUR OWN piece of art?
... And then be moved. That is to raise awareness:

- Move a soul closer to the light -



- 5 -
Turn
AWARENESS
into
ACTION

This is the
""How""
Now we are aware that something must be done by US ... How do we do that?
(The answer:) 
Materializing wishes into actions!


... and then WE will see how WE can...


CHANGE
THE
WORLD





So... What's the money for?

Vehicle

The intention is to buy a beautiful van we could modify : )

Transfer fees

These are charges that Government makes for transferring a vehicle from an owner to another.

Reconditioning

The vehicle must be modified to provide suitable conditions for living and carrying the equipment.

Gas for the first stage

This is gonna be the energy for visiting the first communities in the US southern border.

Incidentals

When you carry out a project, lots of thing can happen. We must be prepared for it!

Indiegogo, PayPal and bank fees

Well... Financial services that must be paid.


Just a van for traveling?... Or...
The vehicle is not the aim ... it is... the vehicle! We see potential in every tool we use. Achieving this goal, we can evolve to a next stage where we are gonna perform many more activities, such as:

Promotion
of artistic activity in young people and adults as a serious discipline


Exchange
of artistic works in conjunction with communities


Arts festivals
where social integration is promoted

Workshops
to train citizens in the defense of human rights through art


Dissemination
of information about social issues not covered by the mass-media

Investigation and documentation
of the illegitimate Latin American art scene



And what if we don't get all the money? 


That's easy... 
we just buy a cheaper van... 



The Impact (PUM!) The main impact is art turned into action and the incalculable power that individual actions have all over the world. The two primary ways are:

1. Bringing out the ARTIST people have INSIDE

We are not bringing art to the people. Our job is to promote the art they have inside and let them know that is not only about beauty. It's about touching your soul and changing the way you feel, think and act.
It's let them know that art can be more than a hobby. It's a powerful tool they have in their hands. It can be leaded toward a cause... toward making a better world.
Also let know to parents that YES! Their children can be artists for living and that possibility must exist in the decision of ""what you're gonna when you grow up?"".

2. Turning ""ART"" into ""ACT""

Usually, the hardest part is ""how to start?""
 ""What's your problem?"" is an artistic production we play in communities where we ask about the main issues the community is going through.
Then we offer our help to generate action plans in which they - by themselves - can solve their problems step by step. This is done through workshops using techniques such as:

Project management
""Dragon Dreaming""
Popular education
Socio-cultural animation
Recreation
Theatre of the Oppressed

By this way, communities become again in active agents of society at the time that self-management is promoted to fight social welfarism and government dependence.


Our last projects in Chiapas, Mexico

Festival artístico rebelde
(""Teacher you made me artist"" - Artistic rebel festival)
Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas, México
It's been three months that teachers are in strike in the whole Mexican country agains a law reform. Since then, they're camping in public zones and they're not leaving until this reform falls. This festival was organized in the central park of Tuxtla Gutiérrez with teachers, artist and friends of the cause to let them know our support, give them strength and bring an ""artistic breeze"" to the hot Tuxtlecan summer. 







¿Cuál es su problema?
(""What's your problem?)
Festival CompArte por la Humanidad - CIDECI-UniTierra
San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, México
 A street theatre play in which the people are asked about the main problems of their communities and are called up to resolve them by themselves.







Teacher's camp photo-documentation
San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, México
Session of photos made at San Cristóbal's teacher's camp that remain is strike against a law reform. The album were shared in social networks and also some of the pics were printed and sold as ""Non touristic postal cards"" to spread the information internationally in the touristic area.

Y ahora te presentamos...

Una breve explicación sólo para vos   ; )
 





 
Un día de tantos - hace mucho tiempo - Saúl decidió convertirse en artista...
Él fue a la universidad y estudió artes dramáticas. Pero lo combinó con ciencias sociales! D : Esta mezcla implosionó en su cabeza e hizo un desastre.
Hasta que un día él dijo: 

""¡Oh, necesito hacer algo por el mundo!... 
Pero soy sólo un artista. 
¿Qué puedo hacer?""

Así que decidió seguir adelante... e ir más allá de lo que el arte es actualmente (al menos para él). Dejó su casa
... y esto es lo que decidió hacer:

- 1 -
Sacar el ""ARTE fuera del ARTE""
y mantener la
EXPERIENCIA ARTÍSITCA

La premisa es el arte como herramienta para el cambio social y el/la artista como agente activo de la sociedad. El arte tiene la impresionante y poderosa energía de mover a las personas... pero su impacto es muy bajo porque siempre está encerrado en una ""sala"".
... Es tiempo de que la montaña vaya a Mahoma.

- 2 -
Llevar
esa
experiencia
a
LA
C-A-L-L-E

En la calle es donde todo pasa. Es donde la sociedad se hace presente, intercambia ideas y evoluciona. Las calles representan la realidad.
¿Qué pasaría si el arte se volviera real también?

- 3 - Permitir a lasCOMUNIDADES serAGENTES ACTIVOS

En este teatro-de-la-vida-real-fuera-del-teatro los espectadores son llamados participantes y este arte-fuera-del-arte es como una masa de arcilla. Los participantes son invitados a (deben de) tocarla, jugar con ella, hacerla suya, aportar algo desde sí...
... Y todos de manera conjunta construir una obra colectiva de arte.


- 4 -
Costruir
EXPERIENCIAS CONJUNTAS
y generar

CONCIENCIA

El poder del arte radica en las emociones.
Qué tanto podés ser tocado(a) por una obra de arte?
Ahora qué tanto PODEMOS ser tocados por NUESTRA PROPIA obra de arte?
... Y luego ser movidos. Eso es generar conciencia:

- Mover el alma más cerca de la luz -

- 5 -
Convertir la
CONCIENCIA
en
ACCIÓN

Este es el
""Cómo""
Ahora somos conscientes de que algo debe de ser hecho por NOSOTROS...
¿Cómo hacemos eso?
(La respuesta:) 

¡Materializando
los deseos
en acciones!


... y entonces NOSOTROS veremos cómo NOSOTROS podemos...


CAMBIARELMUNDO




Entonces... ¿Para qué es el dinero?



Vehículo

La intención es comprar un hermoso vehículo que podamos modificar : )

Costos de transferencia

Estos son los cargos que el Gobierno hace por transferir un vehículo de una persona a otra.

Reacondicionamiento

El vehículo debe ser modificado para proveer las condiciones adecuadas para vivir en él y transportar el equipo.

Combustible para la primera etapa

Esta va a ser la energía para visitar las primeras comunidades en la frontera sur de los Estados Unidos.

Imprevistos

Cuando se lleva a cabo un proyecto, montones de cosas pueden suceder. 'Debemos de estar preparado para ello!

Honorarios de Indiegogo, PayPal y el banco

Bueno... servicios financieros que deben ser pagados.


¿Sólo una microbús para viajar?... 

O...

El vehículo no es la meta ... es más bien... ¡el vehículo! Nosotros vemos potencial en cada herramienta que utilizamos. Alcanzando este objetivo, podremos evolucionar a un siguiente fase donde realizaremos muchas más actividades, tales como:

Promoción
de la actividad artística en jóvenes y adultos como una disciplina seria

Intercambio
de trabajos artísticos en conjunto con las comunidades

Festivales artísticos
donde la integración social sea promovida
Talleres
para entrenar a los ciudadanos en la defensa
de los derechos humanos a través del arte

Difusión
de información acerca de problemáticas sociales
no cubiertas por los medios masivos

Investigación y documentación
de la escena artística ilegítima latinoamericana

Y qué pasa si no conseguimos todo el dinero?
 
Sencillo... 
compramos una microbús
más barata... 


El impacto (¡PUM!) El principal impacto es ""arte convertido en acción"" y el incalculable poder que las acciones individuales tienen alrededor del mundo. Las dos vías principales son:

1. Sacar la/el ARTISTA que las artista que las personas llevan DENTRO

Nosotros no llevamos el arte a los pueblos. Nuestro trabajo es promover el arte que las personas tienen adentro y hacerles saber que no es sólo una cuestión de belleza. Trata más bien de tocar el alma y cambiar la manera en que se siente se piensa y se actúa.
Es hacerles saber que el arte puede ser más que un pasatiempo. Es una herramienta poderosa que tienen en sus manos. Puede ser conducido hacia una causa... hacia la creación de un mundo mejor para todos.
También hacer saber a padres y madres que ¡SÍ! Sus hijas e hijos pueden dedicarse al arte y que esa posibilidad debe de existir en la decisión de ""¿qué querés ser cuando seás grande?"".

2. Convertir ""ARTE"" en ""ACCIÓN""

Generalmente, la parte más difícil es ""cómo empezar?""
 ""¿Cuál es su problema?"" es una producción artística que ""jugamos"" en comunidades, donde preguntamos acerca de las principales problemáticas que están atravesando.
Luego ofrecemos nuestra ayuda para generar planes de acción en el que éstas - por sí mismas - puedan resolver sus problemas paso a paso. Esto es realizado a través de talleres, usando técnicas tales como:

Gestión de proyectos
""Dragon Dreaming""
Educación popular
Animación socio-cultural
Recreación
Teatro del Oprimido

De esta manera, las comunidades pueden ser agentes activos de la sociedad al mismo tiempo que la autogestión es promovida para combatir el asistencialismo social y la dependencia del gobierno.

A full line of 21 tools designed to be the same size as a large zipper pull, roughly the same size as a large paperclip. this means they can fit on a keychain, a zipper pull for a backpack or jacket, or even placed onto a necklace.  Our tools are as diverse as our customers are, so we have everything from suture kits for first aid, to multi wrenches and cutting tools for daily activities.  We want to provide people tools for their lives, regardless of their passions or their backgrounds. Farmers, City Folk, Military, Fishermen or a College Student we've got the tools for the life you lead. At the same size as a large paperclip, these are some of the smallest tool kits the world has ever seen. We want to create tool kits that anyone can carry, without having to keep a 15 pound purse or a 50 pound backpack with them at all times, but still made from tough, quality materialsf.  What you need, Where you need it.

<p>As busy professionals, we often find ourselves with too many items to conveniently carry, especially during business trips of 2 or 3 days when a suitcase is too much and a simple day pack isn’t enough. On top of that, typical backpacks don’t seem to accommodate the essential items we need like chargers, tablets, and laptops.</p>
<p>That’s why we designed OnePack, a super functional backpack for daily essentials, clothing, and mobile devices - the perfect companion for overnights and trips of up to 3 days.</p>

 NOW Sling Bag is Coming！

Weighing only 4.5kg(9.9lb), Zetazs is incredibly powerful and boasts excellent stamina with a 15km(9.3mi) range. Eye-catching LED lights, together with an innovative and bold aesthetic design will turn heads whenever you ride this skateboard on the street.  Collaborating with a top-level fashion designer and gaining creative inspiration from the science fiction film genre, we overturn traditional old-school skateboard concepts and present this unique board with a metallic texture. Fashionable, smart and fun appearance, coupled with durability and strength, results in a board that seeks to make travel safe and striking to watch. Zetazs supports an extremely easy-to-use remote control. With a single click of a button, the skateboard can be switched from going forward to going backward. What’s more, the full range of traditional skateboard operations, such as braking, accelerating and changing gears can all be controlled by the remote. Starting stability and safe braking allow a beginner who has never ridden a skateboard before to almost immediately ride freely in differing traffic conditions. Differing from a traditional skateboard -which cannot change speed, Zetazs has four modes:  Novice, Standard, Advanced and Pro, which make switching speeds possible. Making this skateboard suitable for beginners, enthusiasts and professional riders. Zetazs is simple to use, efficient, and exhilarating to ride. The high-temperature brushless motor can withstand temperatures reaching hundreds of degrees Celsius. Compared to ordinary E-Skateboards, Zetazs offers a higher level of reliability and it’s built to be more durable. Torsional reaction results in unparalleled transmission efficiency and excellent motor performance, which serves up lots of torque and makes for rapid acceleration right through the speed range. Its excellent ability on steeper grades makes riding on a 25-degree slope as exciting as riding on a level surface. The 18650mh high-quality lithium battery allows the skateboard to go a colossal 15km on one full charge. So, there’s no need to worry about running out of power - you can get on with riding to the max. Our skateboard can hit speeds of up to 25km per hour, giving you the agility and the freedom of the wind.An intelligent engine cut-out system which prevents over-heating, short circuit, over-current and provides over-charge protection in the skateboard is constantly protecting your motor. If the temperature of the board gets too high, it will automatically start the power-off system to prevent damage occurring. With intelligent sleep technology, Zetazs is able to constantly collect the battery data. When the skateboard is standby, the intelligent sleeping system will automatically switch to sleeping mode, which will greatly save power, prolong the battery life and extend service time.Another genius feature is that Zetazs is equipped with two USB charging ports, for your convenience. You can charge your laptop, telephone or other mobile devices when the batteries are running low – no more looking for power points on the road. What’s more, your batteries provide 18650mh, meaning that your fashion skateboard doubles up as a handy portable power supply.Larger diameter solid tires not only look cool, but they give improved wear resistance, better skid prevention, and aid superior control when compared to traditional skateboard tires. They require zero maintenance and enable riding in 20% more places and terrains than you can ride on an ordinary board.Manufactured with an aviation-quality aluminum alloy frame, Zetazs weighs in at only 4.5kg (9.9lb) which makes it easy to pick up, carry, and store. Its good looks are only rivaled by its strength, agility and cutting-edge design.All of the electronics and batteries are completely integrated into sealed container making sure it reaches IP54 waterproof grade, so you can safely ride the skateboard on the road where there are 3cm puddles. Determined to conceive a fashion skateboard with safe night-riding capabilities, our designers equipped Zetazs with a very cool and practical lighting system. Long life LED technology makes this board a 24-hour prospect by making it easier for you to see the road surface in the dark and be seen clearly by other road users. Dramatic illumination and breathtaking aesthetics combine perfectly to result in a very current and defined riding experience.In order to make the skateboard easy to carry, whilst never compromising on the quality of reliability, the designers tried their best to make Zetazs thin and lightweight. Aluminum alloy – borrowed straight from the aviation industry, high-quality and durable tires, and the high-capacity battery are all neatly incorporated into 47.5cm(18.7in) of length, in an integrated design that houses the motor and battery container. Advanced electroplating gives Zetazs an attractive appearance. The design allows for the drive system, the energy system, the control system and the power recovery system to mesh perfectly, making the whole skateboard sleek and concise. Although weighing only 4.5kg(9.9lb), its reliability and performance are far better than those of traditional skateboards.Creative structural design not only means you can ride the Zetazs smoothly and safely at high speeds, a clever melding of sci-fi looks and it’s slim, fashionable appearance clearly displays its reliability, carefully conceived quality and oozes futuristic character. The whole skateboard is guaranteed for one year and can be repaired at local maintenance points, in the unlikely event that there is a problem. If there’s no maintenance point nearby, you can contact customer service and send the board back to the original factory for maintenance or repair. The skateboard is not eligible for our warranty replacement if it is damaged through misuse, abuse or negligence. If your skateboard needs to be repaired or replaced due to misuse, you will be liable to pay for the repairs or replacement.

Excessive rubbing can lead to peeled skin, sores and blisters. These can be very painful and uncomfortable.Arch Cushion - Relieves stress and fatigue over arches. This can cause fatigue throughout the whole feet if not protected properly.Metatarsal Cushion - Located beneath the foot to help cushion impact. Tri-Flex Zones - Close knit material placed in zones in your sock that stretch the most. These flex zones are built to withstand irregular and harsh stretching. During action sports, hiking, working or a daily wear, your socks will stretch to the motion of your feet. This will lead to wear and literal tear in most socks, in the Alpha Socks, we guarantee strength for 5 years.   Alpha Team 6! We are 6 individuals who run Alpha Outdoors. Our office space is currently located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. We strive to make the ultimate sock for outdoor setting and city setting. From our weekend adventures, to our corporate weekdays, Alpha Socks are always with us.  ADD ON PERKS (AVAILABLE DURING CHECKOUT) International BackersCarrier - We ship to most international countries via HK Post, SF Express and FedEx, to ensure the package is delivered to you safely in the shortest amount of time with tracking.Duties & Taxes - Please be aware that all international shipments are subject to duties and taxes by your government and you are responsible for paying that.

<p>Yes
sure! Used stainless steel alloy is the same used for professional cooking
knives, more something! </p>
<p><b>What about
maintenance?</b></p>
<p>Knife stainless steel has a tendency to spot after use
in salt water.</p>
<p>All stainless steel knifes need a good rinsing in
fresh water after use.</p>
<p>Wipe dry after using and apply a thin coat of silicone
oil or paraffin, to prevent surface rusty. </p>
<p>Any surface rust can be easily removed by rubbing with
a common eraser for ink or with a cotton cloth soaked in oil.</p>

Because what is lacks is not possible to break!Would you like to know more?  Go further to read below technical information: MaterialsAfter tons of test, we adopted a special stainless steel, able to be sharped as much as carbon-steel alloys but deeply resistant to oxidation and in addiction certified for food contact!ErgonomicsThe special design of the handle, allows to fit the knife in the hollow of your hand very smoothly, giving back the perfect sensation of direction and control of the blade. The special anti-skid profile was designed to assure the best grip on the handle, also with thick gloves, avoiding to slip on the sharp blade.PracticalityTwo edges are available, depending what you want to cut: smooth sharpen edge on a side and special serrated to the other one.  The serrated one starts near to the tip and have an efficiency of about 60% more than smooth blade. Magnetic sheathKnife ergonomic is important, but without a good sheath, the use will be very uncomfortable!  So we designed a sturdy and flat sheath in Cordura, with a magnetic retention.Yes, the special watertight magnet will help you to put away the knife driving the blade directly and easily inside his sheath. No mechanical part to maintain, no complex gesture to take off and put away the knife: just grab and pull, just approach the blade and push. Two ways to fix it: on you belt or on your arm by elastic belt (sold as optional, not supplied). Why we need your support and how you can help this project?Do you like this project? We too! We’re working hard to bring to life this product and we need your help.You can help us by pledging and pre-ordering our Kunai knives. Even if you can't afford to help us reach our goal, we would love it if you shared this with your friends and family.How will the funds be used?The funds generated in this campaign will be used for the mass production run of the Kunai one's.  We have already been paid for the pre-series production and also for most important components of the tooling machine, in order to verify all the details of the project.Now we need your pre-orders only to justify our investment to start the mass production. What we offer as perks?

Any surface rust can be easily removed by rubbing with
a common eraser for ink or with a cotton cloth soaked in oil.

<h3><b>Extended explanation</b></h3>
<p>Our concept is to provide a whole new kind of experience for
the young, adult and elderly who are hungry for some adventure and travelling,
spiced with cool programs.</p>
<p>We have travelled all around the world, mainly in Europe. In
our experience, trips organized by travel agencies are very good, we've seen a
lot of interesting things, but there's still something missing. Then we
realized that this particular 'something' is life itself. We always missed to
have the opportunity to be lost in the charm of the city, in its daylife and
nightlife, to get to know the locals, instead we only got to attend the usual
touristy sightseeing programs.</p>
<p>We attempted to fill this void by organizing a lot of
programs involving a whole lot of people from all around the world, day or
night, in many cities around Europe. I think we succeeded in filling this void,
many evenful weekend are behind us now, we all have fond memories about them.</p>
<p>This is what we want to bring to you now. We are starting a
company through which we can all invest our experience about organizing
exciting and unforgettable experiences around Europe, so you can have as much
fun as we did :) In the first round we start from Budapest, a city which is
equally famous for its history as well as its nightlife, then we will expand to
the surrounding cities as well. So what is this exactly? Check this out:</p>
<p>What if we took you and your friends to a sightseeing tour
on a beerbike where you can drink your beer while looking at the beautiful
sights until the keg runs out, then we would show you the world famous ruin
bars of Budapest (only the best ones of course), then we would have a party at
the most international clubs of the city. Naturally, we would not forget about
our wine culture of Hungary, which will be introduced to you on a guided wine
tasting, then comes a spa party in one of our most famous spas! Then we'll see
what awaits in the night :)</p>
<p>But if you don't particularly like these options and you
were thinking of something different, we will come up with all kinds of event
packages, of which you can freely choose.</p>
<p>Aaand, so you can really get everything, we are working on
an option where you can choose the time when you'd like to come, what kind of
events you'd like to go to and we will organize everything for you so
everything can go smoothly.</p>
<p><b>We make your dream
weekend come true!</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1184788/files/20150130110444-indie4.jpg?1422644684"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h3><b>Questions that will help
you decide if you really are interested in us :) If at least 3 is true about
you, then you surely are!</b></h3>

detail and be responsible for everything while travelling?</p>

<h3><b>Plans for the future</b></h3>
<p>After Budapest we would like to expand to other parts of the
country. We would like to introduce Central Europe's biggest lake, the
'Hungarian sea' to the world, lake Balaton. We would like to show the capital
of Balaton, Siófok, which is the center of freedom and relaxation, and the
world famous Hungarian wines, because the surrounding hills at lake Balaton is
also a big provider of top quality wines.</p>
<p>Hungary is also the home of many festivals. A lot of those
events are being organised every year, and many of them has already won
international awards. We will help our guests to get to these as well, with
special offers.</p>
<p>In Hungary the esoteric culture is very popular, we are
surrounded by a lot of energy. The heart chakra of the Earth is to be found in
Hungary. According to esoterical studies this is where the Earth's energy lines
meet, we can also hear the beats of the Earth's heart, this is why in English
it means 'beating rock': 'Dobogó kő'. The Dalai Lama went there first when he
came to Hungary, because of that it is now a place of pilgrimage. We would like
to show this side of Hungary to the people who are open to it, so they can get
closer to their inner peace.</p><p><br/></p>

<h3><b>Our story</b></h3>
<p>We got to know each other at university, where we all were
members in an international student organisation. We started working
voluntarily with people from other countries then and we instantly fell in love
with it. We organised lots of kind of events for our foreign friends from whole
conferences to simple pubcrawls. The most enjoyable part was that we got to
show them how wonderful, exciting and open Hungary is.</p>
<p><i>„These experiences left us with fond memories. One of my
favourites was a fancy dress party organized for a group of 10 Croatians and 10
Turkish friends.”</i></p>
<p>Every student went home with unforgettable memories. We want
to show this to the whole world! Our goal is to show every group that comes to
Hungary the real experience of a weekend in Budapest, so they can go home with
the best memories of their lives.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Budapest</b></h3>
<p>Budapest is situated in the middle of Europe and has 2
million inhabitants, and it always gets the most prestigious places on
touristic international ratings. Budapest is a constantly developing,
cosmopolitan city full of opportunities. Its architectural and cultural values
are being more and more recognized around the world, we on the other hand want
to show this city from a different angle. Get to know Budapest's young, vibrant
side! Spend a weekend with us, we guarantee it to be full of new experiences
and adrenalin!</p>
<p><i>„Budapest is our home, and we did everything to know
about its wildest sides...”</i></p>
<p>Budapest's modern vibe and openness makes it possible to
properly relax and release the tension for anyone who comes here. Lively
open-air clubs await, unique ruin bars, escape games, beerbikes on the most
beautiful streets of the city and paintball games in the old army bases. You
didn't try some of them yet? That is only a couple of all the options our
adventure seeking customers can choose from!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1151274/files/20150115071932-8752270_xl.jpg?1421335172"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>

Keep reading! :)
Extended explanation
Our concept is to provide a whole new kind of experience for
the young, adult and elderly who are hungry for some adventure and travelling,
spiced with cool programs.
We have travelled all around the world, mainly in Europe. In
our experience, trips organized by travel agencies are very good, we've seen a
lot of interesting things, but there's still something missing. Then we
realized that this particular 'something' is life itself. We always missed to
have the opportunity to be lost in the charm of the city, in its daylife and
nightlife, to get to know the locals, instead we only got to attend the usual
touristy sightseeing programs.
We attempted to fill this void by organizing a lot of
programs involving a whole lot of people from all around the world, day or
night, in many cities around Europe. I think we succeeded in filling this void,
many evenful weekend are behind us now, we all have fond memories about them.
This is what we want to bring to you now. We are starting a
company through which we can all invest our experience about organizing
exciting and unforgettable experiences around Europe, so you can have as much
fun as we did :) In the first round we start from Budapest, a city which is
equally famous for its history as well as its nightlife, then we will expand to
the surrounding cities as well. So what is this exactly? Check this out:
What if we took you and your friends to a sightseeing tour
on a beerbike where you can drink your beer while looking at the beautiful
sights until the keg runs out, then we would show you the world famous ruin
bars of Budapest (only the best ones of course), then we would have a party at
the most international clubs of the city. Naturally, we would not forget about
our wine culture of Hungary, which will be introduced to you on a guided wine
tasting, then comes a spa party in one of our most famous spas! Then we'll see
what awaits in the night :)
But if you don't particularly like these options and you
were thinking of something different, we will come up with all kinds of event
packages, of which you can freely choose.
Aaand, so you can really get everything, we are working on
an option where you can choose the time when you'd like to come, what kind of
events you'd like to go to and we will organize everything for you so
everything can go smoothly.
We make your dream
weekend come true!
Questions that will help
you decide if you really are interested in us :) If at least 3 is true about
you, then you surely are!
You don't want to be the one who organises every single
detail and be responsible for everything while travelling?
Are there any kind of program that you usually don't think
of, but you would love to try it?
You come home from your holidays and all you can show your
friends are buildings and paintings?
Would you like to get to know the nightlife as well as the
museums?
Would you like to try more than one place to party in one
night?
Do you still have some extreme boxes to tick on your bucket
list?
Do you like the words 'party' and 'freedom' better than
'previous engagement'?
Do you just simply want to have an unforgettable experience?
Do you want all that in a secure environment with cheered up
guides? :)
Would you like to choose from a lot of opportunities and
assemble your ideal weekend for yourself?
Have you ever thought of how nice would a weekend abroad be,
only you couldn't be bothered to look after every single detail?
Do you like to go to party to new places and try new things?
If you found any of those questions interesting, keep
reading!

Plans for the future
After Budapest we would like to expand to other parts of the
country. We would like to introduce Central Europe's biggest lake, the
'Hungarian sea' to the world, lake Balaton. We would like to show the capital
of Balaton, Siófok, which is the center of freedom and relaxation, and the
world famous Hungarian wines, because the surrounding hills at lake Balaton is
also a big provider of top quality wines.
Hungary is also the home of many festivals. A lot of those
events are being organised every year, and many of them has already won
international awards. We will help our guests to get to these as well, with
special offers.
In Hungary the esoteric culture is very popular, we are
surrounded by a lot of energy. The heart chakra of the Earth is to be found in
Hungary. According to esoterical studies this is where the Earth's energy lines
meet, we can also hear the beats of the Earth's heart, this is why in English
it means 'beating rock': 'Dobogó kő'. The Dalai Lama went there first when he
came to Hungary, because of that it is now a place of pilgrimage. We would like
to show this side of Hungary to the people who are open to it, so they can get
closer to their inner peace.
Get to know us!

Have you ever been on vacation—driving along the coast or through a town—and wondered about the people who lived there before? Have you ever wished you could meet the storytellers, poets, historians, and musicians who live there now? 


Now you can hear the story behind the scenery with our hands-free audio tour app, designed specifically for motorists

As you drive along, a sonic tapestry of interviews, world-class performances, local humor, and beautiful narration provides a delightful cultural-historical context to landmarks ahead on the touring route. This authentic travel companion will have you wondering how you ever experienced faraway places and people before.

Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way



Our first audio tour app is a four-part series about Ireland’s west coast, one of the world's richest cultural landscapes. Presenting 12 hours of thrilling content, it's the first audio tour app ever created for the spectacular new Wild Atlantic Way driving route, which spans the 1500 miles from Cork to Donegal. 
Can't make it to Ireland? No problem! You can download the content, like a series of podcasts, and experience a virtual tour of the culture, history, and genius of this amazing island anywhere in the world.


Our campaign focus



The series pilot, which we hope to fund with your help, spotlights the magnificent County Clare. This three-hour tour is designed to be enjoyed over two days, so you can stop and explore local attractions at your leisure. And there are many.
Nestled on the Atlantic coast between Limerick and Galway cities, Clare is renowned for its thriving music and dance traditions, breathtaking geography, and captivating prehistoric, ancient, and medieval history. The county is home to the world-famous Cliffs of Moher and the stark, lunar terrain of the Burren, a limestone landscape dotted with hundreds of archaeological wonders—from megalithic tombs and portal dolmens to medieval castles, towers, forts, and abbeys. Clare is the birthplace of Ireland’s most famous high king, Brian Boru, who ruled the island over 1,000 years ago.



The county is also beloved for its annual festivities, from the hilarious to the earnest to the studious. These include the month-long “Lisdoonvarna Matchmaking Festival” and the Willie Clancy Summer School in Miltown Malbay, a.k.a. “Willie Week,” to which a pilgrimage is made each July by thousands of musicians and dancers worldwide. In 2016 and 2017, Clare’s largest town, Ennis, will host the World Championships of Irish traditional music. Known as the “All-Ireland Fleadh” [pronounced flah], the nine-day festival and music competition features top talent and attracts nearly half a million visitors across the globe.

Other ways you can help



If you love the idea of Cultural Roadmapp but can't contribute financially right now—and even if you are contributing—would you like to spread the word about us and this Indiegogo campaign? If so, please avail yourself of the social media buttons over to the right of our campaign video, and share with your networks. Thank you SO much! 
Let's take this road trip of a lifetime together!




We’ll admit it. We have grand plans—nothing short of revolutionizing the travel experience. We see a future in which our one-of-a-kind apps outfit cars, vans, and tour buses around the world, from Italy's Amalfi Coast to Germany's ""Fairy Tale Route"" to Ecuador's Avenue of the Volcanoes. And we want to build a vibrant community of “Roadmappers” on our website, where we can all share audio and video uploads of our cross-cultural travel adventures, trip information, rides, and much more.
But right now, that proverbial Irish road is rising to meet you. 

Will you come and greet it?

Pack the Kargo bag with your tools, CO2 and a tube (up to 29-inch). Snap the bag in place and you’re set. You’ll be ready when you get a flat.  It fits neatly on your water bottle bosses and has an attachment to mount a water bottle cage on top. Unlike a clanking bloated seat bag it’s completely out of your way on the frame. Attach any water bottle cage if you like.<br/></p><p>As a avid bike rider I don't know how many times I got a flat or simply forgot to pack that one tool you really need.</p><p>The cages are made in America.

Unlike a clanking bloated seat bag it’s completely out of your way on the frame.

And because my work is actually to create solutions for that kind of activity, of course I had a lot of ideas to solve some of those problems. I made a very simple and handmade version for myself. I never thought it would interest anyone else, but my father, who is a very pragmatic man, got interested. I made one for him, and he instantly liked, but to my surprise, a lot of other people started to ask me to make more. That's when I realized I should make a campaign not only to offer a solution that others might need, but also, to get the chance to get Hicarus to a much broader community.</p><p>I found out that there were other products similar to my idea, some very pretty, but none offer something that I wanted, that is versatility, to any activity. I knew right away that was a difficult thing to achieve, but I started developing all sorts of ideas to make it possible. This was important for me because I really wanted to use different “terminal” or accessory in the same holster, but it had to be really easy to change, and extremely safe.

The holster lets you have everything under your shoulder, so everything is safe and at the same time easily reachable.  As we told you, this version of the holster, the Archer model, has the coolest feature we created so far, it is in fact what makes this fashion accessory so useful. You can wear two different accessories at the same time, one on each side, and you can change between accessories at any time you want!____________________  LOCK AND UNLOCK YOUR ACCESSORIES SAFELY AND FAST___We use a very efficient and safe system of coupling to our accessories, the Loxx system, which holds up to 150kg, and won't unlock unless you pull de button. To unlock and disengage your accessory, pull the button on the inside of the holster. To put back your accessory on,  just fit in and push until you feel a little click. Make sure it is locked by pulling a little bit.____________________  THE ARCHER ALWAYS FITS YOU___You can resize the holster to fit you better and be more comfortable by adjusting the strap. If you want your holster to be the equivalent of an XL size, pull the buckle up, if you prefer the equivalent of an S size for a more tight position, pull the buckle down. This adjustment is also useful to level the accessories on your side body.____________________  CHOOSE BETWEEN THE 10 ACCESSORIES ACCORDING TO YOUR DAILY NEED___   ACCESSORIE: WORK FOLIO___The Work Folio is the perfect accessory for the workaholic, the thinker, the creative.Always carry your notebook and important documents with you, and don't worry about losing your writing materials. If you urgently need to show something on your notebook to someone, don't bother taking it out of the backpack, just unlock the folio and slide it from the side. Don't let any idea slip from your mind, write it at any time!   ACCESSORIE: SMALL POCKET___The Small Pocket is one of our favorites, because of its size and its multi-use.We think this is the accessory for the minimalist. Or maybe for that person that always carry their pockets full, or even for a night out or a concert. It has the perfect size for the little stuff you always have to keep with you, and we even added a tiny pocket inside for some coins.Don't judge by the size!   ACCESSORIE: NOTEBOOK CASE___The Notebook Case is actually a big case made for the academic.Although it's called Notebook Case, you can use it for carrying your academic book, paperwork, documents... We wanted to give you the choice to literally use it for your own purpose.Choose your own destiny!   ACCESSORIE: PHONE POCKET___This is the essential accessory, for the ones that never leave the phone at home (everyone).Have your phone always easily reachable, but right under your shoulder. We, the creators of these accessories, have been using the Phone Case since the beginning, and we've perfected it. The ideal inclination allows you to easily slip the phone in and out, and the padded material protects your phone and keeps it tight. Don't ever miss that important call again!   ACCESSORIE: MINI-TABLET POCKET___We all know the opportunities a tablet can give us, but it isn't always easy to carry them. With the Tablet Case, on any occasion, you'll be prepared to use your gadget. Read the news in your job breaks, take some digital notes of your thoughts, or just buy some perks online!It has the same design as the Phone Case, with the padded material so your tablet is always tight and protected, only it doesn't have the same inclination so the weight is well distributed.Be always prepared!   ACCESSORIE: WHISKEY FLASK CASE___We consider the Whiskey Flask Case the most elegant accessory we developed. With this case you can bring your own drinks everywhere and share the good taste of life with others. Wear it at your most special occasions. Don't miss the parties life gives you.Be responsible but enjoy the journey!   ACCESSORIE: BIG POCKET___We designed this bag sized accessory, especially for the traveler, the worker, the undecided.It is very useful for your bigger days to know you have that bigger pocket. Some days you'll just need extra space. If the small it's not enough, this is the one!   ACCESSORIE: WALLET___For all the credit cards you have to carry, your ID cards, supermarket cards, and so on. And of course, for all the vintage money. The idea behind this wallet is to carry all of those in a very minimalist, simple and compact way. Be every day prepared to pay your taxi, buy a present, or to offer that romantic dinner.It's not all about the money... Or is it?   ACCESSORIE: SUNGLASSES POCKET___Sunglasses or glasses deserve proper treatment. And that task isn't always an easy one. Made with leather and padded material, this case was designed to be soft, safe and adaptable.Don't forget to see the perks...! __________ The proposal is limited by the following conditions:Dimension limit: 20cmx20cm Thickness limit: 4cmWeight limit: 2.5kg*all of them for comfort purposes It must be within the sensible budget, and it must preserve the aesthetic of archer holster and harmony of its materials.We do not discriminate the function of the accessory! Exclusive Perk Designs already proposed:- paint-brushes case- surgical materials case- photometer    IRONMONGERY DEVELOPED AND PATENTED BY SCHAEFFERTEC___This hardware was the solution for our idea. It makes it really easy for you to change between accessories. Just one pull and one click, with no effort, and it's done, your accessory stays locked and secure. This ironmongery can hold up to 150kg.   ACCESSORIES MEASURES___ OTHER INFORMATION___Hicarus developed gear for independent creators, and, Archer is one of the most versatile products we designed and built with the best materials we could possibly have:       high-quality leather carefully chosen         (very smooth now, ten years from now it’s going to look like it belongs to Indiana Jones)       highly resistant lining        (a high technologically fabric, developed for autosports)       hardware/ironmongery capable of holding up to 150kg        (Developed and Patented in Germany by Schaeffertec GmbH)       high-quality elastics        (The shoulder as a high percentage of cotton to provide more comfort)       waterproof         (both leather and lining)       antiperspirant         (because of its high technologically fabric, it doesn't stain even in the hottest conditions)       adaptable size         (form S size to Xl size)       lots and lots of changeable accessories        (in the most safe, fast and easy way you can imagine)       warranty for life         (if your Archer has a defect, as long as I own Hicarus, I will fix it) The Rise of Hicarus Hi, my name is Hernani D’Almeida, and me and my dad founded Hicarus around the time we started to make machines and equipment for independent cinema.As the experience grows, also grows the excitement and love for the process of development.We became quite good at making and building custom gear for independent creators, not only in cinema, but also for journalists, photographers, musicians, vloggers, videographers, and other independent creators with less known activities, like stage people, djs, youtubers…While developing this gear I always carried my notebook and tablet to save new ideas for equipment and scripts.Because I work mostly outside of predetermined locations, like most independent creators, I carry my office with me everywhere. And because my work is actually to create solutions for that kind of activity, of course I had a lot of ideas to solve some of those problems. I made a very simple and handmade version for myself. I never thought it would interest anyone else, but my father, who is a very pragmatic man, got interested. I made one for him, and he instantly liked, but to my surprise, a lot of other people started to ask me to make more. That's when I realized I should make a campaign not only to offer a solution that others might need, but also, to get the chance to get Hicarus to a much broader community.I found out that there were other products similar to my idea, some very pretty, but none offer something that I wanted, that is versatility, to any activity. I knew right away that was a difficult thing to achieve, but I started developing all sorts of ideas to make it possible. This was important for me because I really wanted to use different “terminal” or accessory in the same holster, but it had to be really easy to change, and extremely safe. Just when I thought it would be impossible to do what I wanted, because I didn’t have the resources to properly develop the solution, I found the Germany company that develops the ironmongery that I need. From that point forward, it was an intense process of design to make a beautiful, good, practical, cost-efficient product. The design will never end for me, I always want to upgrade, but I achieved a really good version with the help of experts in all the materials and process of manufacturing.This is what lead to Archer, named after the character Sterling Archer, just cause its cool. I have five other designs for different holster styles, each one named after a character who uses a holster in their fictional activities.I’m really proud to share all this with this community, and to be able to share this product and my work, and hopefully my future designs and solutions to any creative activity.But mostly I’m really proud to be able to do this together in a collaborative process like I have always done, with the distinction that you can be on the other side of the world, but I will get you an Archer wherever you are, for whatever your need is. Thank you all very much, Hernani D’Almeida. _____As you can see this is a very personal campaign, because we are still at the very beginning of a painful but amazing process, so we will need to team up with every single one of you, our client and partner, because we need every single one of your feedback and support.Thank you!   NEXT IDEAS___We have dozens of drafts to launch in the future, drafts of more models of holsters, with amazing different designs, drafts of ironmongery with unique features, drafts of so many new accessories!New ideas will never end, it's all up to you now...  CONTACTS___E-mail: info@hicarus.store(Don't be shy, any questions feel free to ask)",42.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In 2015, in the midst of the ongoing economic crisis in Greece, the people of Lesvos extended a helping hand to nearly 600,000 refugees crossing the Aegean to escape war, famine and probable death.   But, although Lesvos has returned to normal for well over a year now, the publicity surrounding the refugee crisis has left the island’s tourism in ruins:  Businesses have been shuttered or are on the brink, thousands are unemployed, and young people are deserting their homes to seek a life on the mainland or abroad.   Yet the island is as ready as ever to welcome visitors as it always did.  So, we need <u>you</u> to help Lesvos recover.  We need <u>you</u> to help us spread the word and bring tourism back to Lesvos.</p>
<h3>What happened</h3>
<p>In 2015 the world’s attention was riveted on the island of Lesvos, as it suddenly and very literally became the crossroad between Asia Minor and Europe, a beacon of hope for human beings fleeing war and poverty. Setting aside their own burdens, the economic hardship and austerity measures they were already facing,<strong> the islanders rose to the occasion to help in any way they could</strong>. Without asking for acknowledgement, without taking into consideration how this would affect their own livelihood, without thinking that the help they were about to give would not be returned back to them.  For months, as thousands of refugees landed on its shores, the islanders worked tirelessly, alone, with no government assistance or NGOs on their side.  Unfortunately, they’re now alone yet again, facing a crisis no one seems to pay attention to.</p>
<h3>What was the impact</h3>
<p>The press has spoken about the islanders’ compassion, sense of duty, their solidarity with the refugees and the hope they gave to thousands. <strong>However, the same photos and coverage of its peoples’ courage and self-sacrifice drove tourists away.</strong> Tourist arrivals dropped nearly 80%. Businesses dependent on tourism across the vast majority of the island, were forced to close or are barely hanging on.  Thousands ended up unemployed.  Families and entire villages or farms that depended on tourism, were all left without incomes. Without hope.</p>
<h3>What is happening now</h3>
<p>The refugee waves diminished by mid 2016 and the island returned to normal.  Except that, even though the coastlines and roads are cleaner than they have ever been before, <strong>chartered flights are still cancelled</strong> to the island, <strong>tourist agencies are still not adding Lesvos to their programs</strong> and the <strong>Greek government and the EU have yet to acknowledge the economic hardship the refugee crisis has spawned </strong>and to put in place any measures to aid the affected small businesses and displaced workers. Had this been a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or flood, aid would have been provided immediately from national and international agencies. Unfortunately, nothing happened. The islanders are on their own yet again.</p>
<h3>What we are fighting for</h3>
<p>The publicity surrounding the refugee crisis and Lesvos’ central role in it has continued to be recycled with every bit of related news.  Lesvos is still mentioned in articles and blog posts distributed worldwide which are describing events associated with the refugee crisis taking place in parts of the world thousands of kilometers away, often causing misconceptions regarding the reality of life on Lesvos today.  We are fighting to win back our livelihoods, to rebuild the tourism industry that’s kept the vast majority of the islanders employed over the years.  We need to amplify our voices, we need to balance the story the world hears.  We need to reach out to travellers and tourists and share our message and bring them back to experience this beautiful island we refer to as The Other Aegean.  The less-travelled, the more authentic, the more welcoming Aegean.  We want to share with them the magic this island has to offer.  The natural beauty, the history and culture, the gastronomy, and most of all, the hospitality.   Lesvos is under the protection of UNESCO.  It is the hidden gem of the Aegean Sea. It is the island of hope and peace.  A place where you discover something new each time you visit. </p>
<p>Over the last two years numerous NGOs have expended tremendous resources to deal with the plight of the refugees.  We need your help to deal with the plight of the islanders.  We need <u>you</u> to help Lesvos and the islanders whose livelihood depends on tourism. </p>
<h3>
<br/>Why we are fighting</h3>
<p>By raising awareness and asking support for the plight of the islanders, by no means should this ever mean diminishing or disregarding the severity of the plight of the refugees. <strong>Indeed they are totally two different predicaments, but they are united and intertwined at the same time. </strong>We have witnessed the power of thousands of everyday people uniting to provide whatever help they could in order to address the challenges presented by this unprecedented refugee crisis.

</div></div>","In 2015, in the midst of the ongoing economic crisis in Greece, the people of Lesvos extended a helping hand to nearly 600,000 refugees crossing the Aegean to escape war, famine and probable death.   But, although Lesvos has returned to normal for well over a year now, the publicity surrounding the refugee crisis has left the island’s tourism in ruins:  Businesses have been shuttered or are on the brink, thousands are unemployed, and young people are deserting their homes to seek a life on the mainland or abroad.   Yet the island is as ready as ever to welcome visitors as it always did.  So, we need you to help Lesvos recover.  We need you to help us spread the word and bring tourism back to Lesvos.
What happened
In 2015 the world’s attention was riveted on the island of Lesvos, as it suddenly and very literally became the crossroad between Asia Minor and Europe, a beacon of hope for human beings fleeing war and poverty. Setting aside their own burdens, the economic hardship and austerity measures they were already facing, the islanders rose to the occasion to help in any way they could. Without asking for acknowledgement, without taking into consideration how this would affect their own livelihood, without thinking that the help they were about to give would not be returned back to them.  For months, as thousands of refugees landed on its shores, the islanders worked tirelessly, alone, with no government assistance or NGOs on their side.  Unfortunately, they’re now alone yet again, facing a crisis no one seems to pay attention to.
What was the impact
The press has spoken about the islanders’ compassion, sense of duty, their solidarity with the refugees and the hope they gave to thousands. However, the same photos and coverage of its peoples’ courage and self-sacrifice drove tourists away. Tourist arrivals dropped nearly 80%. Businesses dependent on tourism across the vast majority of the island, were forced to close or are barely hanging on.  Thousands ended up unemployed.  Families and entire villages or farms that depended on tourism, were all left without incomes. Without hope.
What is happening now
The refugee waves diminished by mid 2016 and the island returned to normal.  Except that, even though the coastlines and roads are cleaner than they have ever been before, chartered flights are still cancelled to the island, tourist agencies are still not adding Lesvos to their programs and the Greek government and the EU have yet to acknowledge the economic hardship the refugee crisis has spawned and to put in place any measures to aid the affected small businesses and displaced workers. Had this been a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or flood, aid would have been provided immediately from national and international agencies. Unfortunately, nothing happened. The islanders are on their own yet again.
What we are fighting for
The publicity surrounding the refugee crisis and Lesvos’ central role in it has continued to be recycled with every bit of related news.  Lesvos is still mentioned in articles and blog posts distributed worldwide which are describing events associated with the refugee crisis taking place in parts of the world thousands of kilometers away, often causing misconceptions regarding the reality of life on Lesvos today.  We are fighting to win back our livelihoods, to rebuild the tourism industry that’s kept the vast majority of the islanders employed over the years.  We need to amplify our voices, we need to balance the story the world hears.  We need to reach out to travellers and tourists and share our message and bring them back to experience this beautiful island we refer to as The Other Aegean.  The less-travelled, the more authentic, the more welcoming Aegean.  We want to share with them the magic this island has to offer.  The natural beauty, the history and culture, the gastronomy, and most of all, the hospitality.   Lesvos is under the protection of UNESCO.  It is the hidden gem of the Aegean Sea. It is the island of hope and peace.  A place where you discover something new each time you visit. 
Over the last two years numerous NGOs have expended tremendous resources to deal with the plight of the refugees.  We need your help to deal with the plight of the islanders.  We need you to help Lesvos and the islanders whose livelihood depends on tourism. 

Why we are fighting
By raising awareness and asking support for the plight of the islanders, by no means should this ever mean diminishing or disregarding the severity of the plight of the refugees. Indeed they are totally two different predicaments, but they are united and intertwined at the same time. We have witnessed the power of thousands of everyday people uniting to provide whatever help they could in order to address the challenges presented by this unprecedented refugee crisis. We now ask to come together one more time. We ask for the help of everyday people to unite once again, this time to help Lesvos, to help the islanders’ whose future depends on tourism. The people of Lesvos need your help so they can continue to provide help to those that need it most.
What we plan

We aim to raise 50.000$, to help spread our story and amplify our voice.  Our plans include:

Boost online presence (travel websites, own site, social media advertising and presence, organic search presence and native advertising) - 25% of the funds

<h3>What is BeasTi? What makes it unique?</h3>
<p> BeasTi is a first of its kind wolf shaped Grade 5 Titanium multi tool. Among all the multi tools available in the market, BeasTi stands out with its beautiful looks. It is crafted out using state of the art practices and best quality raw materials to achieve the desired output. Not only it is beautiful but is also packed with necessary tools which comes in handy to tackle the problems faced in our daily lives. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Titanium?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Titanium Grade 5 (6Al4V) known for its highest strength-to-weight ratio.  Its 40% stronger and 40% lighter than stainless steel. Ti-6Al-4V is the same material used aerospace industry even in Space X Falcon 9 and  bio-mechanical applications (implants and prostheses). </p>
<p>Its Highly corrosion-resistant even when exposed to sea water and chlorine. Oceanographers report that titanium immersed for 30 years in saltwater produces no measurable corrosion. This is because Titanium forms a protective oxide film instantly, when it’s exposed to a trace of air or water.</p>
<p>All of these attributes make Titanium an ideal metal of choice.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474128931/ga4mcx8olkm0td1pj1xr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>One can find a lot of multi tools in the market. All of them are made to replace the traditional tool box. Many of these tools are compact and well designed. But there are no tools which are elegant and designed to look like a fashion accessory; a tool which can make a style statement and make people go wow. For the first time, we have designed a tool which not only serves its purpose, but also enhances one’s style quotient. BeasTi is designed with an unique look inspired from a wolf. The use of Grade 5 Titanium not only makes it lightweight and powerful, but also enhances the beauty of the tool.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a team of 2 students in Specialized Masters in Business Strategy and Innovation of the Institute of Higher Economic Studies of Paris in France. We complement each other to the extent that we combine Innovation and Specialty Strategy where we excel each. We realize this campaign because this application has a strong potential because of the volume and the frequency of its target and especially the improvement of the conditions of the travelers. Indeed the airlines in case of exeding weight luggage offers astronomical prices while in the same flight there are travelers who not a suitcase or who have room. Also long term jobs can be created at any airport where this application will be used. imagined all these jobs that will help people to have access to work. Finally the concept is magic because it makes money by selling empty spaces which is very attractive for our customers</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To finance this project, we are asking for $ 50,000, which essentially goes into the development of the application with adequate payment security systems and especially advertising. We are aware that we are tackling a sector where we have in front of us the geniuses of the domain who have more resources but we believe that the concept is reliable and simple.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our project funded by contributors is valuable to the world in the sense that we will improve the conditions of travelers, we will create jobs and we will change habits. We tested our model on facebook by creating a page where a traveler posted his itténéraire and gave the space which he had. In those who wanted to send bills would come into contact with him and those who took the same flight or the same journey. With this success we are certain that better frame this would represent a real revolution</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>this project, which is so dear to our hearts, carries risks but which represent an asset according to a certain point of view. The difficulty lies here in terms of security. Indeed to entrust these cases to a stranger is sometimes complicated. However to overcome this we will set up a customer rating system. Thus we will be able to determine as and when the credibility of a person. Also we say that it is an asset because to solve the security problem we want to create jobs which will consist of the verification of the materials and goods to transport. That's the beauty of the project.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a young successful entrepreneur I had always traveled  But it wan't until I was in my 40s and met a young Colombian photojournalist (while living in Buenos Aires) that I first went backpacking -- to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/brie.austin/media_set?set=a.246628590132.292225.596895132&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">northern Argentina</a>. I was hooked, and it changed my entire life. I've been vagabonding ever since, with a passion to discover new places, cultures and adventures.</p>
<p>17 years later at the age of 60 I've now been living in India for 5 years, where I've taken <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bruce.dugan/media_set?set=a.1209413782405413.100000104096563&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">many motorcycle trips</a>.</p>
<p>With a background in media-entertainment-tech I'll combine that experience and, partnered up with <a href=""http://www.perceptiontravel.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PRCPTION Travel</a> produce the full length documentary <strong><i>RIDE OF YOUR LIFE</i></strong>.   </p>
<p>As you get older (for me it was 50) you sense your own mortality; no longer the invincible version of your youth. But I'm up for the challenge; facing the elements and the limits of my own body and mental fatigue that this trip will present. </p>
<p>This film is important to me. It is a way to document an adventure most people will never get the opportunity to do. And we'll deliver a well-produced reality show - documentary of value.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>You contributions and sponsorship will be used for :</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional video and camera equipment.  </li>
<li>Drome operator and equipment.</li>
<li>Travel expenses to fly my lead cameraman to India.</li>
<li>Gear: camping gear, extra parts for the bikes, etc.</li>
<li>Jounrney expenses; fuel, home stays, permits etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>We'll provide content beginning months before the ride, including training, research, building our ride team, and planning. Then will begin rolling video from the time we leave Bangalore until our return, with continual advanced and behind the scenes video clips, photos, and blog posts to share everything with you, our vicarious passengers and sponsors. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You might ask yourself why you'd want to support such an undertaking.

</div></div>","Short Summary
As a young successful entrepreneur I had always traveled  But it wan't until I was in my 40s and met a young Colombian photojournalist (while living in Buenos Aires) that I first went backpacking -- to northern Argentina. I was hooked, and it changed my entire life. I've been vagabonding ever since, with a passion to discover new places, cultures and adventures.
17 years later at the age of 60 I've now been living in India for 5 years, where I've taken many motorcycle trips.
With a background in media-entertainment-tech I'll combine that experience and, partnered up with PRCPTION Travel produce the full length documentary RIDE OF YOUR LIFE.   
As you get older (for me it was 50) you sense your own mortality; no longer the invincible version of your youth. But I'm up for the challenge; facing the elements and the limits of my own body and mental fatigue that this trip will present. 
This film is important to me. It is a way to document an adventure most people will never get the opportunity to do. And we'll deliver a well-produced reality show - documentary of value.  

What We Need & What You Get
You contributions and sponsorship will be used for :

Additional video and camera equipment.  
Drome operator and equipment.
Travel expenses to fly my lead cameraman to India.
Gear: camping gear, extra parts for the bikes, etc.
Jounrney expenses; fuel, home stays, permits etc. 

We'll provide content beginning months before the ride, including training, research, building our ride team, and planning. Then will begin rolling video from the time we leave Bangalore until our return, with continual advanced and behind the scenes video clips, photos, and blog posts to share everything with you, our vicarious passengers and sponsors. 

The Impact
You might ask yourself why you'd want to support such an undertaking. I've always believed that travel cures ignorance, and in this day and age to see people and cultures up close and personal expands ones world view To feel the struggle we endure and overcome, and to see the majesty of the places we're going to go, I believe will bring a slight shift in the viewers perceptions of life and people. I hope so.    
This project will kick start the relaunch of First Drum Films, a company I created in 2002 to facilitate the completion and distribution of The Last Poets, a documentary. It aired on Bravo TV (2003-2006), and exists now in libraries in Sweden and Australia. 
Jordan Urbanovich of PRCPTION Media , an up-and-coming non-profit 'smiling media' company, will be lead camera team and co-producer.

Only 2,5% of water is drinkable.Almost 10% of all the world's diseases would not even exist if the water supply, sanitary conditions and hygiene were improved and if water resource management was on a higher level. That would, in return, also lower child mortality rates, improve human health and food status in a sustainable way. Plastic is a material that the Earth cannot degrade, which represents a large environmental problem. Huge plastic islands that systematically destroy all wildlife are formed in the oceans, affecting human health as well.We can recycle plastics the proper way, but we can also simply switch to using glass - the most natural material for water preservation that is also 100% recyclable. Get Freewa glass bottle with an eco felt bag. Both are 100% recyclable.Download the Freewa App, start mapping free drinking water sources and refilling your Freewa bottle each time you spot one.If we work together, the dream of everyone in every corner of the Earth having access to free drinking water will very soon turn into reality. ...and next time when you are thirsty, just check the map for the nearest water source and fill up your Freewa bottle. Download Freewa App for your iPhone or Android:  Choose some of the perk options - whether you are a city type, an adventurer, a businessman or an urban art lover, we have perks to thank you for supporting Freewa. We are the Freewa team: Goran Ladisic, Vedrana Vrabec, Mihaela Ivanec and Marko Rasic.Marko and Vedrana are Designers and Art Directors with 13 years of experience in interdisciplinary projects and multimedia, and internationally awarded cultural programs. Goran spent years on management positions in large companies. Mihaela is a lawyer with background in tourism and real estate.What connects us all? Love for the nature, a firm believe that we need to protect this beautiful planet and preserve it for our children, and an idea that every human being has the right to receive the gifts that nature had given us. Like clean water. This is what brought us together and how Freewa project came to life.    What does Free Water Project mean?  What will you use funds for? Donated funds will be used for producing the very first batch of Freewa glass bottles and eco felt bags, for the development of the App into eco network and monitoring of the quality of the drinking water.  Why should I support Freewa?Because it will be your contribution to the Earth, to every generation yet to come!  Who created Freewa? We are Goran, Marko, Mihalea and Vedrana – team from Croatia who want to make a change of world's perspective of free drinking water.  Where can I buy Freewa bottle?Freewa bottle is not for sale at the moment, but you can get it in exchange for an Indiegogo donation (take a look at the perks which include Freewa bottle).  What is the Freewa bottle made of? Freewa bottle is made of glass, bottle cap is made of BPA and EA free material and it is 100% recyclable, the eco felt bag is made of recycled PET bottles which can be recycled again.   Why does Freewa bottle say Thank you? The most beautiful word you can hear and say to a human being, to nature and to water is thank you and that's why we wrote it in 12 different languages on the first Freewa bottle edition.  Where are Freewa bottles produced?Freewa bottle, cap and the bag are all made in Croatia. By manufacturing in Croatia (EU), we are stimulating the local economy and creating jobs.   What is the difference between Freewa App and Freewa website water mapping?There is no much difference – you can see, search or add a water spring with both. Use the one which suits you better in certain situation.  How does Freewa App work?With Freewa app you can search for free water sources all over the world. Any water source - drinking fountain or a spring you see, you can add to Freewa app – just enter its location and add a photo of it.  Is Freewa App free?Yes, just as the drinking water should be!  Do I need to have an account to add a new spring to Freewa map? You don't need to have an account to search for free water locations in the App, but if you would like to add a spring you will need to register.  How can I download Freewa App?Freewa App is available for download at Google Play Store for Android and AppStore for iOS users.  When does Freewa perks' shipping begin?We will start shipping Freewa perks at the end of November/beginning of December 2017. If production permits, some perks will be sent out even sooner.  How much is the shipping?It depends on which country are you from and which perk did you choose. Upon choosing the perk and entering the country you want to send it to, you will be able to see how much would the delivery cost.  What if my town/city/country doesn't have free drinking water?Freewa map will show you the nearest free drinking water sources! Even though you don't have the access to free drinking water at the location you live, where ever you travel pay attention to free drinking water sources and add it to the Freewa map.   I have a suggestion, offer or a question for Freewa.Contact us at info@freewa.org** Mi iz Freewa tima vjerujemo da su sva ljudska bića rođena slobodna. Slobodna da hodaju zemljom, udišu čisti zrak i piju besplatnu, čistu vodu, što također spada u osnovna ljudska prava. Isto tako vjerujemo da je na nama i odgovornost očuvati ta ista prava za generacije koje tek dolaze. To će biti naš doprinos Zemlji. Podrži Freewa-u, hrvatski projekt za očuvanje slobodnih izvora pitke vode. Freewa je hrvatski proizvod – web platforma i mobilna aplikacija za mapiranje lokacija s besplatnom pitkom vodom u cijelome svijetu te eko boca za vodu i torbica.  Prema UN-ovim istraživanjima, čak milijarda ljudi na Zemlji nema stalan pristup zdravstveno ispravnoj vodi za piće. Svega 2,5% svih voda zauzima pitka voda. Gotovo 10% svih bolesti na svijetu ne bi niti postojale poboljšanjem opskrbe vodom, sanitarnih uvjeta, higijene i boljim upravljanjem vodnim resursima. To bi i smanjilo smrtnost djece te poboljšalo zdravlje i prehrambeni status na održivi način. Plastika je materijal koji Zemlja ne može razgraditi i predstavlja velik problem za okoliš. U oceanima se stvaraju ogromni plastični otoci koji sustavno uništavaju biljni i životinjski svijet, a time nedvojbeno utječu i na zdravlje ljudi. Možemo reciklirati plastiku na ispravan način, ali možemo je i zamijeniti staklom, koje je najprirodniji materijal za čuvanje vode i 100% reciklirajuće. Freewa staklena boca s torbicom od eko filca.

Now's YOUR CHANCE to help families devastated by hurricane Maria in PR with electricity. We have just DAYS LEFT to get as many solar panels together as we can for Puerto Rico recovery. With the help of DJ Manny, the first solar panels are shipping to his hometown in Caguas.For every $10,000, we're giving away 1 set of Vanopys to recovery in Puerto Rico by the holidays. We know that's a lot of money to send solar - but we're a very small company (5 employees). Rest assured, we've been in business since 2010, completed other offshore projects, and even worked Willie Nelson's solar stage trailer and our CEO is a Fulbright-Hayes Fellow - WE WILL get solar panels to Caguas, PR for the first shipment and if we meet our goal, other shipments to follow. Our PRIMARY GOAL with the Indiegogo campaign is to raise donations to GIFT PUERTO RICO solar panels by the holidays. Please click the hot pink ""BACK IT"" button on the Indiegogo campaign to give to a lovely cause. </p><p>2. Through this campaign, you also have the option to buy three different models of the Vanopy at a <strong>special campaign price</strong>.  Those are located in the perks. If you're in the market for solar panels, THIS IS YOUR TIME to get serious about ordering. $99 for a 65 watt solar panel that weighs only FOUR POUNDS (that's 1.8KG), installs easily onto your RV roof or rolls up to only 8"" to fit on your backpack is a GREAT INTRODUCTORY PRICE and is cheaper than it's direct competitors.<br/>Our 130 Watt panel isn't as great of a steal, but it is a fair price for a FULL POWER SOLAR PANEL that can power your RV battery in apx 5 hours - so we think you'll love the amount of power plus portablity you get for the price.<br/>All models have a 5 YEAR WARRANTY + 30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE, no questions asked.

<p>Solar is expensive, heavy, and involves lots of math. The Vanopy was created with cost, simplicity, and portability in mind. Right now, it's the only solar panel canopy of it’s kind. That puts us in a prime market position to start where we need to on price and work at lowering the costs as we grow.

Now's YOUR CHANCE to help families devastated by hurricane Maria in PR with electricity. We have just DAYS LEFT to get as many solar panels together as we can for Puerto Rico recovery. With the help of DJ Manny, the first solar panels are shipping to his hometown in Caguas.For every $10,000, we're giving away 1 set of Vanopys to recovery in Puerto Rico by the holidays. We know that's a lot of money to send solar - but we're a very small company (5 employees). Rest assured, we've been in business since 2010, completed other offshore projects, and even worked Willie Nelson's solar stage trailer and our CEO is a Fulbright-Hayes Fellow - WE WILL get solar panels to Caguas, PR for the first shipment and if we meet our goal, other shipments to follow. Our PRIMARY GOAL with the Indiegogo campaign is to raise donations to GIFT PUERTO RICO solar panels by the holidays. Please click the hot pink ""BACK IT"" button on the Indiegogo campaign to give to a lovely cause. 2. Through this campaign, you also have the option to buy three different models of the Vanopy at a special campaign price.  Those are located in the perks. If you're in the market for solar panels, THIS IS YOUR TIME to get serious about ordering. $99 for a 65 watt solar panel that weighs only FOUR POUNDS (that's 1.8KG), installs easily onto your RV roof or rolls up to only 8"" to fit on your backpack is a GREAT INTRODUCTORY PRICE and is cheaper than it's direct competitors.Our 130 Watt panel isn't as great of a steal, but it is a fair price for a FULL POWER SOLAR PANEL that can power your RV battery in apx 5 hours - so we think you'll love the amount of power plus portablity you get for the price.All models have a 5 YEAR WARRANTY + 30 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE, no questions asked.

Off-grid solar power gives you freedom 
TECHNICAL SPECS

We have been in the off-grid solar RV business since 2010. Four years ago, Thomas and I, René, set out to invent a solar panel that could be used anywhere by anybody. Think about all the places we could have solar but is so hard to get to - those people need the Vanopy. 3% of our campaign is supporting the Whole Planet Foundation, empowering women globally one solar panel at a time.

 
 
 


The Vanopy uses advanced technology with CIGS solar cells and 100% round filament HDPE textiles (which are also recyclable).  It took four years of product development, from the solar cell up, listening to advisors, test marketing, 3 years of product beta testing, and over $60,000 in sales to bring the Vanopy to market. 
 




Robots on the factory floor at MiaSolé - making solar cells + modules for the Vanopy.
Solar is expensive, heavy, and involves lots of math. The Vanopy was created with cost, simplicity, and portability in mind. Right now, it's the only solar panel canopy of it’s kind. That puts us in a prime market position to start where we need to on price and work at lowering the costs as we grow. Your support will help us make the best product for the best price and help everyone get the solar power needed to power real life.

</h2><h2> </h2><h2>TANDEMONIUM</h2><p>For years, we’ve been asked the same question – “Do you make a tandem kayak?” We’d redirect the question and give our pitch on the beauty and freedom that comes with paddling solo. After all, our single-seater models, the Beach LT, Bay ST, and Coast XT, have been designed and meticulously refined over the last six years to deliver the most liberating kayaking experience a paddler could dream up.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535155115/fr3uji1g0svl6xgaupfy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><br/>But over the last couple of years, our own families started to grow. Our parents, partners, kids, and friends wanted to come along when we went kayaking.  This shifted our perspective and we heard the call of the community with fresh ears. “When are you making a two-seater?” Well, the wait is over – the answer is now.</p><p> </p><h2>MEET THE HAVEN</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536970990/rk3caj7jaaiucmfgm0yk.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Our designers combined the ancient art of origami with everything they’ve learned from the past six years of designing foldable kayaks. The result is a tandem kayak with unmatched performance and portability.  It's also our most versatile model ever – the Haven easily converts to a single-seater kayak with the switch of a few buckles, for those times when you just want to fly solo for a bit. And the integrated rail system lets you add a ton of accessories for fishing, photography, picnics, or whatever else floats your boat.</p><p> </p><h2>FEATURES<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535153489/vvnphlxl2clq8fm8al8f.png"" src="""" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'/>

At 40 pounds, it's half the weight of a typical tandem kayak— save your back for some paddling! Don’t have a garage? Who cares! Tuck the Haven into your closet, under your bed, or any nook that suits your fancy. Don’t have a roof rack on your car? Don’t even own a car? Who needs one!

If you've already backed the Haven, we're working hard to build your boats and get them shipped to you before paddling season. If you haven't ordered yours yet, the Haven is still available at a discounted rate here on Indiegogo AND on Orukayak.com for those interested in financing their boat purchase for only $999 upfront.  Thank you again, talk soon, and we love you all!

 TANDEMONIUMFor years, we’ve been asked the same question – “Do you make a tandem kayak?” We’d redirect the question and give our pitch on the beauty and freedom that comes with paddling solo. After all, our single-seater models, the Beach LT, Bay ST, and Coast XT, have been designed and meticulously refined over the last six years to deliver the most liberating kayaking experience a paddler could dream up.But over the last couple of years, our own families started to grow. Our parents, partners, kids, and friends wanted to come along when we went kayaking.  This shifted our perspective and we heard the call of the community with fresh ears. “When are you making a two-seater?” Well, the wait is over – the answer is now. MEET THE HAVENOur designers combined the ancient art of origami with everything they’ve learned from the past six years of designing foldable kayaks. The result is a tandem kayak with unmatched performance and portability.  It's also our most versatile model ever – the Haven easily converts to a single-seater kayak with the switch of a few buckles, for those times when you just want to fly solo for a bit. And the integrated rail system lets you add a ton of accessories for fishing, photography, picnics, or whatever else floats your boat. FEATURES
 ORU FEATURES
PortabilityLike all our kayaks, the Haven uses origami to fold up into a box small enough for car trunks or closets. At 40 pounds, it's half the weight of a typical tandem kayak— save your back for some paddling! Don’t have a garage? Who cares! Tuck the Haven into your closet, under your bed, or any nook that suits your fancy. Don’t have a roof rack on your car? Don’t even own a car? Who needs one! Put it in the trunk of a Lyft, bring it on public transit, or the sidecar of a motorbike. Zoom zoom.It should be noted that the Haven is just slightly too big to fit in our existing Oru Pack. We’re working on redesigning the pack, but in the meantime, we’ve designed a strap and handles for the boat that allows two people to comfortably carry the Haven. And all of the components of the kayak tuck into the folds when it’s boxed up, so you’ll have your whole other hand free for carrying.  
DurabilityAll of our kayaks are made from a custom extruded polymer that is rated to 20,000 folds. The material is a thicker version of the same plastic that postal service bins are made out of – and those things take a beating. While we recommend treating your Oru like a fiberglass boat, these boats are scootable and draggable and bump-proof. Also, the two floorboards provide the boat with extra protection.  Hooking together from the top and bottom, the two floorboards create a protective case for the Haven. The boat also holds up well in extremely cute situations.  
 PerformanceThe Haven combines the stability and quick set-up of our Beach LT with the performance and speed of the Coast XT. This boat, like all of our kayaks, uses origami to deliver incredible tracking and stability— the hull folds create hard chines and a long keel line. The lightweight materials make handling easy and responsive across all of our models. Plus, the double-man/woman power of the tandem allows the Haven to really move.   
  VersatilityWe call it a tandem, but it's really much more than that. Feel like paddling solo? Switch a few buckles and bump the seat forward, and you've got yourself a high performing solo kayak. Consider your commitment issues enabled. Same boat, two ways to paddle The integrated rail mount system lets you attach all sorts of accessories for fishing, photos, or just kicking back.  Check out our Behind the Fold video for a detailed walkthrough of the different ways to utilize the rail mount.
  ASSEMBLYEven though this boat has added components and space for a whole other person, we knew we had to keep the assembly quick and easy – if not the easiest. Chances are you’ll be setting up the Haven with kids or pets running around, friends trying to toss you a beer, or as you’re racing to catch the sunrise. Our designers utilized the intuitive closure system of the Beach LT, and added colored cues to the stitching and g-hooks so you know which strap goes where at first glance. Printed icons and instructions on the floorboards also make setup a breeze. Every kayak comes with a printed assembly guide, walking you through each step. Some people prefer to reference the assembly guide video on our product pages. Be patient on your first try! With two people and a little practice, assembly takes under 10 minutes. BETA TESTER REVIEWSDon’t take our word for it. Hear from the paddlers who have tested the Haven.""I love the new Haven and so does my pup! When it's just the two of us she gets the whole front of the kayak to stand and sniff the air. The Haven has enough room that we can bring along another person, a tent and some gear for an overnight at our favorite paddle-in campsite!"" - Jess A, ""The Haven was incredibly fun and stable- The additional weight of having a friend on board just made it easier to navigate and a wonderful shared experience. It folds up compactly and would fit perfectly in my small VW Bug. - Jacqueline""The design is simple and felt sturdy and roomy for two people with a dog. It was intuitive to put together on the first assembly.  I felt really comfortable in the Haven for my first ever kayaking experience."" - Jasmine, ""I found the Haven to be quick and easy to setup, particularly  with experience on the Beach and BayST models. Seating is adaptable and the kayak is very stable, even in rolling waves that are beginning to break. My dog Whiskey appreciated having room to spread out and he enjoyed the ride. The kids really liked it too- enough to try the stunt of standing up in the kayak, and everyone stayed dry!"" - Scott LET’S BUILD TOGETHERWe designed the Haven because it’s more fun to paddle together. It’s also more fun to build things together!  After months of engineering, problem-solving, prototyping, and beta testing, we finally have the design complete. And the result is beautiful if we do say so ourselves. With your backing, we’ll be able to purchase the dies, molds, materials, and factory equipment required to mass produce this product.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">As we design and develop towards that dream, we’ve had quite a few micro innovations along the way, and Bekan is just one of them. The hours and energy we’ve put into creating Bekan have been many, but it has been worth every second. We genuinely believe that it is the essential rear bike lighting system for brighter and safer riding experience. And with your support and backing, we hope to make it a tremendous success that we can experience together.</p>

<p><strong>Modmo</strong> was founded by, then 21-year-old, <strong>Jack O’Sullivan</strong> from Ireland. After starting his first bicycle company at age 17, Jack felt there was no middle-ground between being a sweaty cyclist and a frustrated driver sitting in traffic. Jack wanted to create the bike that would replace your car for urban mobility. </p>
<p>After a year of slow progress in Ireland, Jack packed his bags and took a trip around Taiwan and China to find the perfect factory. After a month of meetings (and too much Karaoke), Jack realised a traditional bicycle factory wouldn't be up to the standard of Modmo. After a spur-of-the-moment trip to a high-tech motorbike factory in Vietnam, Jack knew this is where Modmo would come to life and he hasn't left since. </p>
<p><strong>Ton</strong> is Vietnamese and comes with years of experience in mechanical engineering and designing IOT devices. After spending months working part-time on weekends, Ton quit his job to join Modmo full-time and now leads engineering and manufacturing. </p>
<p><strong>Phu</strong> joined us part-time to develop and optimise the PCB(Printed Circuit Board), which links all the components together and, <strong>Trung </strong>wrote and tested the firmware to give Bekan it's functionality. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Although this is our first Indiegogo project, each member of the Modmo team is highly experienced in their field, and has brought their skills and passion to help get the Bekan where it is today. We have been developing and extensively testing a series of prototypes, and now have an advanced version of Bekan that is almost ready to go into full production. Our full team is living and working in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam where we are also able to manufacture almost every part of Bekan so we hope to be able to solve any manufacturing issues very quickly. However, as with any manufacturing endeavour, there are some challenges that we may not forsee. The main risks that we have identified are based around mass manufacturing and the need to produce the moulds and tooling which can be time consuming due to their need of extreme accuracy. CE and ROHS certification testing could delay shipping if there are issues.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We pride ourselves on quality control, but it does take time. That being said, we're confident that we can resolve these issues with our manufacturing partners, and have Bekan ready in time for shipping. Please be reassured that we will provide regular updates to all our backers and be totally transparent across all communications.</p>

IT'S TIME FOR A BETTER BIKE LIGHT
One of the most frustrating and expensive issues we repeatedly hear from other cyclists is the issue of bike light theft. No matter how you attach them or where you leave your bike, they can be spotted and stolen before you know it. 
If you’re lucky enough to not have your lights stolen, they are often clunky looking and easily damaged due to their exterior placement. Looking into things a little more, we noticed that there wasn't much innovation happening in bike lighting. We thought it was time that there was, and set about creating a bike light that was smarter, stronger and more secure…
So we created Bekan.

THE TAIL-LIGHT THAT'S GOT YOUR BACK
 

INTELLIGENT INSIDE.INCOGNITO OUTSIDE. 

GET THE INSIDE STORY
 
As bicycles and cities get smarter, we wanted to ensure that Bekan could keep up with and exceed the needs of modern cyclists. That meant going back to the board, literally. It holds more than 20 COB LED’s, motion sensors, accelerometers, a battery management system and more. We then sealed everything within a weather-resistant housing for maximum protection. 
MAKE MOVES

MOTION SENSOR
 
Bekan is always thinking, which means it's aware whether you're riding or not. Anytime you stop to take a rest from the road; the motion sensor will automatically switch Bekan off after 3 minutes to reserve energy. And when you're on the move, it switches Bekan back on. All you have to do is fit and forget.
 
A BRAKE FROM THE NORM

AUTOMATIC BRAKE LIGHT
The more other road users have an idea of what you're doing, the less likely there's a chance of an accident happening. Bekan uses an accelerometer, so it knows when you're slowing down, and responds smartly by activating a braking mode. This turns the flashing into a solid full-beam, alerting drivers and riders when you're coming to a stop.
 
WET? NO SWEAT.

WEATHER-RESISTANT PROTECTION
Picture it, beautiful blue skies for miles and not a cloud in the sky. It's a perfect day to ride. Until you start your journey, and it begins to rain. Thankfully, not a problem for Bekan because all of its intelligent features are protected within a sealed weather-resistant housing. Even if it rains, Bekan shines.
 
CHARGE IN A SNAP

MAGNETIC CHARGING 
Like everything else with Bekan, charging has been designed with ease and convenience in mind. When it’s time for a top-up, simply connect the magnetic cable and get up to a month of ride time from a single charge. What’s more, the cable also gives you access to all the latest Bekan firmware updates.

Two screws. One simple way to install. You don’t need to do the math to know that installing the Bekan is a breeze. Just take out your current seat post, swap your saddle onto Bekan and, you’re ready to ride.
 
A BRIGHT FUTURE

ULTRA-BRIGHT LEDS
They say there’s safety in numbers, which is why we designed a custom COB with over 20 ultra-bright LEDs onto Bekan’s custom mod-board. These little beauties produce a powerful illumination of light, which ensures that you never go unnoticed day or night. The light is roughly 150 lumens although this hasn't been professionally tested yet. 
 
CONTROL TWEAK

CLICK TO CONTROL
Everything about the Bekan is designed to just work. No hassle and certainly no fuss. With the master power button, all of Bekan’s impressive features are at your fingertips. One press turns Bekan on standby for motion detection, press again for always on and, press a third time and it's lights out. 
 
MADE TO MEASURE

Available in: 25.4mm, 27.2mm, 30.9mm, and 31.8mm. 
In our experience, one size doesn’t fit all. That’s why Bekan is available in four of the most common sizes: 25.4mm, 27.2mm, 30.9mm, and 31.8mm. There's 3 easy ways to check what size you need. 1) You can measure the inside diameter of your seat tube. 2) Measure the diameter of your old seat post. 3) Google it!
So whether you’re treating yourself to a new bike or sticking with an old favourite, there’s a Bekan made just for you.
 
AHEAD FOR HEIGHTS

SEAMLESS ADJUSTMENT 
Whether you're sitting tall or have more of a low profile, your riding position is as unique to you as your fingerprint. With Bekan's seamless styling and uncluttered finish, you have unlimited flexibility to adjust the height of Bekan precisely the way you like it.
Bekan's Packaging 

Our thoughtful packaging design enables the cardboard lid to be turned 180 degrees, giving an On/Off effect.
Each box contains the following:
x1 Bekan Tail Light - In a size of your choice
x1 Magnetic Charging Cable
x1 Instruction Leaflet
 
REINVENTING HOW YOU RIDE
Hi, we’re Modmo! What’s Modmo? Well, it’s a portmanteau of MODULAR and MOBILITY. From the very beginning, our passion for cycling and sustainability has been at the core of a singular vision to build an electric bicycle that can replace your car. 
As we design and develop towards that dream, we’ve had quite a few micro innovations along the way, and Bekan is just one of them. The hours and energy we’ve put into creating Bekan have been many, but it has been worth every second. We genuinely believe that it is the essential rear bike lighting system for brighter and safer riding experience. And with your support and backing, we hope to make it a tremendous success that we can experience together.
Meet the team.

Modmo was founded by, then 21-year-old, Jack O’Sullivan from Ireland. After starting his first bicycle company at age 17, Jack felt there was no middle-ground between being a sweaty cyclist and a frustrated driver sitting in traffic. Jack wanted to create the bike that would replace your car for urban mobility. 
After a year of slow progress in Ireland, Jack packed his bags and took a trip around Taiwan and China to find the perfect factory. After a month of meetings (and too much Karaoke), Jack realised a traditional bicycle factory wouldn't be up to the standard of Modmo. After a spur-of-the-moment trip to a high-tech motorbike factory in Vietnam, Jack knew this is where Modmo would come to life and he hasn't left since. 
Ton is Vietnamese and comes with years of experience in mechanical engineering and designing IOT devices. After spending months working part-time on weekends, Ton quit his job to join Modmo full-time and now leads engineering and manufacturing. 
Phu joined us part-time to develop and optimise the PCB(Printed Circuit Board), which links all the components together and, Trung wrote and tested the firmware to give Bekan it's functionality. 

 
Risks and challenges
Although this is our first Indiegogo project, each member of the Modmo team is highly experienced in their field, and has brought their skills and passion to help get the Bekan where it is today. We have been developing and extensively testing a series of prototypes, and now have an advanced version of Bekan that is almost ready to go into full production. Our full team is living and working in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam where we are also able to manufacture almost every part of Bekan so we hope to be able to solve any manufacturing issues very quickly. However, as with any manufacturing endeavour, there are some challenges that we may not forsee. The main risks that we have identified are based around mass manufacturing and the need to produce the moulds and tooling which can be time consuming due to their need of extreme accuracy. CE and ROHS certification testing could delay shipping if there are issues.
 
We pride ourselves on quality control, but it does take time. That being said, we're confident that we can resolve these issues with our manufacturing partners, and have Bekan ready in time for shipping. Please be reassured that we will provide regular updates to all our backers and be totally transparent across all communications.",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

Modobag is the invention of Chicago entrepreneur and world traveler Kevin O’Donnell. He got the idea while he was traveling through the airport with the Chi-Town’s Finest Breakers, when the kids started taking turns riding on his suitcase. It was at that point he told them, ""We're gonna put motors in these!"". As soon as he reached his destination, Kevin called his college buddy Boyd, and the concept for Modobag was launched.
 



Kevin O'Donnell; After studying Industrial Design at the University of Illinois, Kevin spent several years in the technology space where he launched numerous eCommerce ventures. Since 2014, Kevin’s main focus and passion has been the Modobag. Kevin lives the Modobag mantra of wanting to change the way the world travels.

Boyd Bruner is a competitive motorcyclist with an eye for design and a sense of adventure. He served as a technical director, and won the 2014 AMA Pro Road Racing Daytona 200. The thought of a motorized piece of luggage was a project ideally suited for his curiosity.

At several points, the exterior shell celebrates its intersection with both the natural environment and its hidden, interior structure.  Though filled with light from porous windows on one side, TERA harbors a mysterious and magnificent inner design. Once you step inside of the building, you will discover another world – one that is beautifully futuristic and oriented towards captivating views of the scenic Hudson River.On the ground floor, you’ll find TERA’s living area – equipped with a bathroom and shower, a food preparation counter, and a living room with a seating area that pours out to a beautiful 3D printed terrace. The terrace will provide an outdoor seating area overlooking the land, the forest, and the Hudson river.  Inside, stairs like a series of curved wooden layers will separate the ground floor from the more private second floor. The second floor can be adapted to the activities of its inhabitants with a simple rearrangement of the furniture – transforming the concept of a sleeping / relaxing area as one that can double as an eating and gathering area.  TERA is a living laboratory where feedback and operational data will be used to improve future designs for our future Earth and Space habitats. Each TERA will build on the last until we achieve highly autonomous structurally performing human-rated habitats. Just like MARSHA informed the development of TERA, all the knowledge we gain from TERA will feed back into our extraterrestrial design and construction.   TERA is unique from other construction projects because it’s designed to be as minimally invasive as possible to its surrounding environment.In our first design phase, we altered the shape of MARSHA to fit it into a wooded landscape and maximize its square footage. We also carefully studied the mechanical details of 3D printing a structure with more windows – examining the angles at which we could print the largest number of window openings without the material collapsing over the empty space below it.  After acquiring the land for TERA, we completed an assessment of the build site through a number of mechanisms including a laser scan of the site’s topography. This will allow us to print TERA without leveling the ground and keep the land as close to its existing contours as possible. When TERA's first lifecycle is over, she'll be recycled without having left any trace on the land she inhabited.  In our second design phase, we’ll create a full 3D simulation of our print on a computer to determine how TERA will get anchored to its site and make sure our robot doesn’t collide with any obstacles (like rocks). We’ll also conduct additional material testing: we’ll print a portion of the floor and wall in our lab space to strength test horizontal pressure from wind and earthquakes (lateral load), and we’ll test for fire resistance (something not required by NASA, but that will enable us to authenticate our habitats as designed for human life).  Once on the site, we’ll create minimally invasive gravel pathways and clear out just enough vegetation to help us get robots to the print site and set up a mobile field office / mobile laboratory, allowing us to continue prototyping and testing before the final build (including perform an “air print” – a print without material – to ensure our robot arm has enough space to build).TERA will ultimately be 3D printed on site with AI SpaceFactory’s mobile robotic platform, allowing us to face and adapt to the challenges of building harmoniously with the environment. It will be retrofitted with its interior wooden structure and finishings and be ready for its first guests in March 2020.   TERA will be located in Upstate New York – only 1.5 hours by train from New York City by train. The site is easily accessible by both car and public transportation, yet it feels as though it’s in a distant land, far from the city – encased in a forest of trees along the Hudson River. The site has several vantage points of the river and a beautiful path that leads to several overlooks, one of which will house tables for scenic meals along the river. The land has acres of unspoiled nature to explore as well as several private trails and a small stream that runs through the property – and all can be accessed by guests during their stay.   We’re already geared up to print TERA – we have the equipment, the construction material, and the build site. Now, we just need the funds to make TERA the most sustainable it can be – by taking it completely off-grid.All the funds raised from this campaign will help us reach that goal by connecting well water and adding solar power. And anything raised above our funding goal will be used to make TERA even greater and more sustainable. That means extra off-grid features like a grey water purification system and aquaponic garden, and extra amenities for all of our Indiegogo backers, like a high-powered telescope for stargazing, and catered picnic brunches for backers. But we can’t reach this goal alone – to create our off-grid vision for TERA, we need your help to get there.        AI SpaceFactory was founded in 2017 by architect David Malott to create life-sustaining architecture for long-term missions to Mars, with the goal of revolutionizing the architecture of Earth. We’re now a team of 8 architects, technologists, artists and engineers invested in finding and developing transformative, sustainable technologies on and beyond our world.",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The initial concept was hatched up by Christophe. As an 18 year old high school grad, he set off on a journey of a lifetime and got aboard a freightliner headed for New Zealand, this with nothing more than his backpack full of clothes and no more than 1300 euros to his name. After an amazing 9 month trip he was out of crazy ideas to make ends meet, although his pancake on the beach business was a stroke of genius.</p>
<p>After his travels he got an engineering degree and continued travelling and entrepreneuring. One of his successful endeavors was a creative magazine he and his team members produced and sold on the streets in an informal and fun way. They made quite a lot of money for the creative production house they set up. This gave him the idea to globalise this concept by creating a booklet with travel tips and stories that could be produced and sold all over the planet. Hence our first booklet was born.</p>

     Hall ... 
I am the creator
     of a little cowboy character on TNN, Hee Haw, Buckmasters, and now on
     RFD-TV called Shotgun Red.     www.shotgunred.com 
 Even though the music business for
     me is mostly in Nashville Tennessee my heart is in Minnesota!  I
     love to Ice Fish and Open water fish up north.  I have owned a fish
     house or 2 and always had to get down on my hands and knees to get water
     for the minnows, water on the stove, etc.  
I thought there has got to be a better way!   
In the very beginning I sat down and made a prototype, 
I thought it should do way more then dip water... 


Then I hired a firm here in Nashville to do all the CAD drawings to make the molds...  They are Tennessee Design Co. Nashville TN. 
(See drawings)  
Then after a lot of searching we paid over $35,000 to get molds made.
Now we have all the samples here at the shop and they look great....

We even put one in the freezer for 24 hours then twisted it... thru it on the floor hard about 10 times... and it did not break and no cracks!
Now we need your help ....  In a way we are just asking you to pre-order because when you make a pledge of $25.00 we will ship you a $25.00 Skinny Dipper out as soon as we get them in.  The body of the dipper and the yellow ruler that is inside come in two separate pieces so we got an ultrasonic welder to fuse the 2 parts together. That will be done at our shop in Nashville. We will then apply a 10 inch label produced by CRT here in Nashville that has neat photos and graphics. 

We wanted to make sure that it was at least designed and assembled here in the USA.   Our boxes and shipping supplies are from ULINE out of Wisconsin .   
I can tell you I was pretty upset when we went to get molds done here.  They were about $40,000 more and when I asked the US manufacturer if I could come to there plant and watch part of the mold process he told me there plant was over seas.  I told him if you think I'm going to pay you $40,000 to pick up the phone your nuts.
 I made the plastic parts in two separate pieces so they could be designed and assembled here in the USA.  These companies need to work on bringing full manufacturing back to the USA!   We are doing as much design, assembly, and shipping and handling as possible here in Nashville on The Skinny Dipper.
 
On a lighter note... this has been a ball showing this to everyone. 
Here is what I
     heard!
""You can
     chill your drink ice cold in that chilly water!""
""I can wash my hands without hanging over the side of the boat!"" 
""You could
     put your rods in there so they don't get broken!""
""What a neat
     way to give your dog a drink out on the lake!""
 ""Now I
     can measure my fish without getting poked!""
Everybody says.. ""I want one as soon as you get them made!

So here is the business end of things!We already did the proto-type work and paid the design company and paid for two molds ... one for the dipper body... and a separate mold for the ruler.Now we are looking for help from everybody to get the parts made.  Once we place the order it takes about 60 days to get here ... then we need to ultrasound weld them together and apply labels and box and print shipping labels. So we can offer the Skinny Dipper at $25.00 to the public we need to order about $35,000 worth of parts at once.  All we need is $25,00 at a time from 1400 of the nicest folks in the world!  Of coarse you can opt to pledge in at the $50.00 or $100.00 perk level and we can get there even faster....  Nobody anywhere makes a product like this and I got a bunch sold already but we can""t do it without YOU!!!Thanks in advance...Steve Hall / Inventor of The Skinny Dipper",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Plot Pod</h3>
<p>My name is Marcus Emfinger and I am the founder and inventor of The Plot Pod.  With a degree in Electrical Engineering, I have always been passionate about new ideas that will help people take control of their lives.  With The Plot Pod, even the novice outdoor photographer can discover what is around when no one else is.  Whether it's game in the field, predators in the brush, or the occasional trespasser,  The Plot Pod is there to help get just the right shot at the right angle.  With your help, we can get this idea to market and start helping take control of our outdoor activities again.</p>
<p>At Plot Pod, our goal for this campaign is $50,000.  The majority of the funds will be used to have the molds built to make the product and fund the initial order of Plot Pods.  The remainder will be used to repay a loan that was needed to file the patent.  For our passionate supporters, we are set to offer a tiered perk system.  Some of the perks will include: Plot Pod logo T-shirts, caps, tumblers, and even a Plot Pod itself for those dedicated to the cause.  In the event that we do not reach the campaign goal, the funding will be used to take the process as far as possible.  From there, we will try to secure the remaining funds to make this product a successful launch to the outdoor world.</p>
<p>As an avid outdoor person, I have struggled many times to capture the action as it was taking place in the field.  Many times, as I'm sure many of you have also, I've searched for the perfect spot to mount my trail camera only to find that the game came from another place or direction.  I've wasted countless hours and dollars retrieving SD cards only to find that the image was blurry from windy conditions or the object was too far away.  This is the reason I designed the Plot Pod with it's unique features.  It has gotten rave reviews from the few people that I have shown it to and I know that you will find it fills so many needs of many people.  I have personally used the prototype and am super excited to introduce it to the world.  </p>
<p>In building this product, we have come across many hurdles along the way.  Many of them we have hurdled and are making strides towards an end goal.  Some of these hurdles include materials to use, portability, construction, and even minor details all the way down to types of fasteners and screws.  However, many of these we have overcome and now we have a great design in place and are set to build The Plot Pod.  With your help and support, we are ready to finish manufacturing the product and bring it to market.  We can't wait to see The Plot Pod and it's impact on the game and trail camera market.</p>
<p>We, at The Plot Pod, do understand that not everyone can contribute even though you may want and desire to.  However, everyone can help get the word out and make The Plot Pod campaign a success.  Remember to share with your friends and family using the Indiegogo sharing tools and many other sharing apps from twitter, facebook, instagram, and etc.</p>

I am an 18, almost 19 year-old male currently living in Brooklyn, New York. I am in college and doing all that I can in order to have a bright future. At the end of High School, I lost a dear friend and as such fell into a deep depression. I didn't understand how to cope with the stress of applying for college, dealing with High School finals and the typical drama that goes on in High School. Add an unsupportive family and friends that didn't understand, and you get someone like me, barely clinging to life. <b>I found happiness through the action sports of parkour and freerunning and through those sports I eventually found myself behind a camera and I started to enjoy life once again</b>. I'm still struggling with depression, but I found that photography is the one thing in this world that makes me feel like life is worth all the hassle. Currently, I shoot with a Canon T5i and with my phone. This campaign is to raise enough money to buy better camera equipment and to fulfill a promise to a dear friend that unfortunately passed away last October. <b>I just want to make people happy</b>, and I feel that through photography, I can put a smile on someone's face from across the world. <b>You, the contributor,</b> would be helping change my life for the better and would be aiding me make art for all to see.</p> </div> <div> <h3>All I need is...</h3> <p>$10,000. I understand that is a large amount of money and that my age is not really in my favor here. I bet a lot of you reading this would think that I'm immature and can't handle such amount of money. <b>However</b>, I have been through more experiences in my almost nineteen years, than the majority of ""adults"" teaching at my college. Unlike other people my age, I don't do drugs, (not saying that I'm better than anyone, just that I don't have a divided focus, which is what I see most people who take drugs have), and I study my ass off in order to keep my scholarships and stay in school. By donating to this campaign you would be helping me travel to Japan, which has been a dream of mine to visit, from as far back as I can remember. In exchange for your contribution, I will send you several of the pictures I take before I publish them on my online store, as well as personalized pictures, (skip to ""Risks and Challenges"" if you want to understand what I mean by ""personalized""). If you donate enough money, I will ship a poster or canvas print, (whichever you choose). All of the funds for this campaign will go into this trip and into getting me the best camera gear that I can get my hands on.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why it matters to me and why it should matter to you...</h3> <p><b>Like I said above, I just want to make people smile.</b> I post my pictures on Facebook, and Instagram, as well as selling several pieces on an online store to help fund my photography and to help put me through college. <b>""Why should I care about this?"" </b>Well, if you're reading this then I can safely assume I grabbed your interest and you might want to see exactly what kind of work I can come up with. <b>By donating to this campaign</b> you get to see the pictures before I make them available for everyone else to see, and you will get special access to limited edition prints and the longest/most sincere ""thank you"" email you have ever gotten in your life. Each email will be personalized in some way to each contributor. I feel like this project is valuable to the world because it will show everyone the power of human kindness. I'm not forcing you to donate, the only reason you should donate to this campaign or any campaign for that matter, is because you genuinely <b>want </b>to. I HAVE actually traveled before, so there's no need to be afraid of me getting hit by the ""culture shock"" and not doing what I promised to do. I will do all that I can to make this trip incredible and to make the pictures that I take, truly unforgettable, (in a good way, I swear).</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I'm not going to sugarcoat it. This is going to be difficult. I am <b>not fluent</b> in the language, I have never been there before, AND it is the furthest I will have ever traveled away from home, (literally, I'm going to the opposite end of the Earth for this project), also <b>I'm doing all of this alone</b>. And frankly, I'm nervous about this. It's an incredible feat but I'm also incredibly excited to get out there and experience the culture and learn all that I can in the span of my visit. I don't know anyone in Japan and as such I'll have to rely either on the <b>kindness</b> of strangers, or by my own wit. I live in New York, so I'm used to fending for myself, (sort of speak), and since both of my parents are from Poland, I'm used to traveling long distances and <b>love to fly</b>. Before I go to Japan, <b>I will create a list of places</b> that I want to see and will ask <b>what do YOU the contributor want to see</b>, so that I can take pictures for all of you that have never gone to Japan and want to go, or at least see what you want to see and not desperately search for that one good picture on google and waste your own time--Let me be your eyes.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you made it down here, Thank you! Seriously, thank you from the bottom of my heart. This is my first campaign and I am not used to doing anything remotely similar to this. If you can't contribute to this project, that's fine.

<br/><h3>What this is all about:</h3> <p>As you know, I'm trying to get on one of the 2016 Millennial Trains Project Journeys.  My project is to make financial literacy accessible. I plan on doing this through a crowdsourced blog and educational platform. I got my inspiration from blogs like ""<a href=""http://thepointsguy.com/about-me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Points Guy</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One Mile at a Time</a>"".</p>
<p><b>Who I am:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Nalin, I graduated from Northwestern University in the summer of 2014. I've been working at Johnson &amp; Johnson in Singapore since then. Before university, I completed my National Service in the Singapore Police Force. You can get my full story <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nalinnatrajan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>What's inspired me:</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>My experiences allowed me to meet people from a huge range of backgrounds. One thing that concerned me was that many people lacked basic finance skills. I found this to be true regardless of education or family income.</p>
<p>Don't just take my word for it though. Recently, I did some reading and found that it's not an isolated trend. The <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/11/daily-chart-19"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Economist found</a> that many countries' residents lack financial literacy. Additionally, they also found a big gender divide when it came to financial literacy. Another publication, the the <a href=""http://asia.nikkei.com/Markets/Capital-Markets/Three-quarters-of-Asians-ignorant-of-money-matters-survey-finds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nikkei Asian review, found</a> a disparity along countries' incomes. </p>
<p>This means is that a significant number of people around the world lack basic finance skills. These people may end up making ill informed decisions that could cost them a lot. While some schools do teach a little basic finance, it's rarely enough. I believe that I can work to change that with a crowdsourced blog and platform. My platform would make learning these skills easier and more accessible.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What I want to do about it:</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>One day, I came across the <a href=""http://millennialtrain.co/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Millennial Trains Project (MTP)</a>. MTP helps young innovators launch projects beneficial to their communities. This gave me the perfect opportunity for me to launch a financial literacy project! </p>
<p>MTP validated my idea, and accepted my pitch. I now have the opportunity to travel across the United States with talented mentors and innovators. This would not only allow me to learn from my travelling companions, but also from the communities we go through. The end result will be a compelling platform that helps people make more informed financial decisions.</p>
<p>Your contribution here will help me get on the 2016 MTP journey, launch and publicise my project, and most importantly, allow you to be a part of something that will add value to people's lives!</p>

<br/> </h3><p> </p></div>","Introducing the SMUG e-bike. The most eye-catching, high-performance electric bike you’ll ever see. Forget what you know about dull, boring e-bikes. SMUG is rewriting the rule book. SMUG is designed to stand out. Have you ever seen an e-bike that looks like a vintage American motorcycle? It’s a timeless, classic design, built to last. A laid- back cruiser “bobber” or “Chopper” style so in vogue with motorcycle manufacturers.Enjoy making people smile? This attention-grabber is the perfect e-bike for you! Within 30 seconds you’ll know why we call our e-bikes “SMUG” Its performance is second to none. Choose from a 750w rear-hub motor for sweat-free cruising, 1,000w for those who like to live in the fast lane, or a whopping 1,500w for you crazy off-roaders, all coupled with top spec hydraulic disk braking and superb front fork suspension.Fed up with pedalling? A 5-level power-assist gear changer at your fingertips allows you to cruise around while keeping up with the traffic. Or, you can unleash the beast and hit up to 30 mph (1,500w model only) comforted by some radical suspension forks, and protected by serious hydraulic brakes! With SMUG, you’re free to go anywhere. Whether you love inner-city travelling or offroad adventures. Its fat, 3-inch tyres and state-of-the-art suspension make every ride a smooth ride. It’s lightweight and easy to transport. Take it anywhere.   We know that everyone who climbs on to a SMUG e-bike will love it, but especially commuters, people who already ride motorcycles, plus fashionistas.   Dynamic and indisputably unique  frame design capturing the same laid- back cruiser “bobber” or “Chopper” style so in vogue with many motorcycle manufacturers, wonderfully complimented with either 750w rear-hub motor for sweat-free cruising, 1,000w for those who like to live in the fast lane, or a whopping 1,500w for you crazy off-roaders, all coupled with top spec hydraulic disk braking and superb front fork suspension.   With a SMUG e-bike, you’re able to go where standard motorbikes are not allowed. SMUG makes traveling through the city fast and efficient. The battery life is perfect for the commute, giving you the ability to cruise comfortably at 20 mph for up to 30 miles. Then, take it offroad for some weekend adventures. You can ride your SMUG e-bike in places you could never take a motorbike, such as parks and cycle paths.We think what SMUG riders will love most is the looks of envy and admiration they will get as they ride along.

Started as a school project, it soon became a much more ambitious project.

Nothing is going to stop us because we have YOU who believe in US!</p><p>Your support, as precommand or as donation will help us to produce our first product (raw material has to be ordered in big quantities, travel &amp; meeting with supplier and producer etc.)</p><p>And you know what? As everything started with a Master project and is still part of it, you could also help us graduate.

On the market, you only have the choice between the quality product named “leather” which is a beautiful product but comes from an animal and contributes to its suffering or synthetic material which most of the time contributes to pollution. We want to offer to pet owner who cares about Nature and animal a product that is natural and provide an improvement in the dog comfort as well. Cork is much lighter than Leather and smooth.</p><p>Even if you don’t care about buying leather because you think “the animal is already dead for its meat”, just think about mass consumption and that you the only one that could make things change.

Started as a school project, it soon became a much more ambitious project. But creating a startup while we are still studying with few money in the pocket is complicated and we did not want to let our big ideas and our children’s dream escape us. Nothing is going to stop us because we have YOU who believe in US!Your support, as precommand or as donation will help us to produce our first product (raw material has to be ordered in big quantities, travel & meeting with supplier and producer etc.)And you know what? As everything started with a Master project and is still part of it, you could also help us graduate. Isn’t it that great?In the future, we want to continue developing other fancy and creative products respectful of the environment for pets and pet owners. Let’s impact the world together!Our ProductsHORSEGAN protects the environment reducing the waste of animal leather and other chemical supplies by providing high-quality cork halters for horses and dogcollars. Cork enables the production of ecological halters to save animals, reducing the negative impact we have on the world around us and helping to preserve the planet to make the world a better place.Horse Halters DogcollarsAbout Cork Our GoalOur project is not only about making a product and sell it but is much more. On the market, you only have the choice between the quality product named “leather” which is a beautiful product but comes from an animal and contributes to its suffering or synthetic material which most of the time contributes to pollution. We want to offer to pet owner who cares about Nature and animal a product that is natural and provide an improvement in the dog comfort as well. Cork is much lighter than Leather and smooth.Even if you don’t care about buying leather because you think “the animal is already dead for its meat”, just think about mass consumption and that you the only one that could make things change. And more, you will get a trendy product that nobody has!
With your help, we could show our professor that we have a great idea and that we are successful entrepreneurs → we will graduate :)
You will contribute to make a better world, reducing chemical production and animal suffering.
We would be happy to share a picture of your pet with our product on our instagram and facebook, because our pet are stars !
 Our TeamWe are 3 master students studying Entrepreneurship and willing to have an impact in the world. Our project is part of our Master degree but is much more than a school project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>BraveHearts Expeditions is an Outdoor Adventure and Experiential Learning  business. We provide one-to-three-day hiking, trekking, abseiling, biking, kayaking and mountaineering adventure services in Ghana.</p>
<p>Our modern-day Explorers sleep in tents, eat food cooked over camp fires, hike on some of Ghana’s breath-taking landforms, slush through knee-high rivers, hack their way through jungle thickets, scramble over dirt paths, kayak on lakes and engage waterfalls on expeditions that contribute to creating economic power for young people and local communities, and enhancing Ghana's tourism sector.</p>
<p>This campaign aims to generate funds to build a global adventure tourism centre on islands in Lake Volta. It is important for us to do this, and your contributions will help put Ghana on the world map as Africa's most engaging adventure tourism destination.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are campaigning to raise a starting minimum of 500,000 Ghana Cedis (~$105,000) to set up the Survival Island Adventure Resort, which will host the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The world’s longest zip lines over the world’s largest man-made lake at thrilling lengths of 5.2km and an installed capacity of 500 participants a day</li>
<li>A highly interactive high-action ropes challenge infrastructure to accommodate a minimum 1000 customers a day.</li>
<li>A freshwater climatic pool and chalets  for corporate retreats and overnight campers.</li>
<li>Passenger-boat cruises to and from adventures on Survival Island.</li>
<li>Weekend, week-long and day-out Kayaking adventures for tourists, adventurers and corporate bodies (already done).</li>
<li>Paint-balling adventures and contests for thrill- and adventure-seekers.</li>
<li>Boathouses and Docks (already done)</li>
<li>Canopy walkways</li>
</ul>
<p>In return for your contribution, we offer you twice the value of your contribution in adventure services. If you contribute 500 Cedis, for example, you will receive tickets worth 1000 Cedis to sign up for adventures on Survival Island, and the tickets have lifetime value - they never expire until the services are used up.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project not only creates a new adventure paradigm for Ghana and West Africa; it also gives contributors the power to reshape Ghana's tourism potential to the image they have always wanted to see. In addition, this project will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create employment, 65% for rural women, during the 3-month construction and installation period.</li>
<li>Provide economic incentives to protect the rich ecosystem of the Volta Lake and prevent biodiversity loss through enjoyment of its natural and lacustrine resources.</li>
<li>Train and employ at least 100 unemployed graduates as adventure guides, customer service operatives and office staff.</li>
<li>Contribute to ecotourism offerings around the Akosombo dam.</li>
<li>Increase Ghana tax revenues from tourism.</li>
<li>Increase foreign exchange inflows from tourists</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges we might face in pulling this project off (interference from government agencies or feet-dragging in some small aspects, Ghana ports and harbour delays, storms on Lake Volta, extreme heat and dehydration due to elemental exposure during construction and validation) will all be overcome by our governmental and public sector networks, our unparalleled experience working in Ghana's amazing outdoors, and our tenacity and leadership as West Africa's leading adventure tourism firm.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you have no funds to contribute, you can help us by sharing this campaign with those who you believe can, and asking them to contribute. This campaign contributes to funds we hope to raise from potential investors we are currently engaged with. You can also talk to us about project investment opportunities. Together, we can pull this off as an unprecedented West African first!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! We're the Davis family. Oklahoma born and raised, we've been floating the Illinois River for years. We've loved the beautiful scenery, the friendly faces, and the awesome experience to be had around the Tahlequah area and in the Illinois River resorts. On our yearly float in 2016, we met veteran and longtime river resident Ross, current owner of Patriot Park.</p>
<p>Ross informed us of his wish to travel, to sell his property and spend more time with his grandchildren. So, after much consideration and time invested in exploring the possibilities of this property, we decided we'd like to maintain and grow this scenic river destination.</p>
<p>We have only one problem: financing.</p>
<p>With your help, we can purchase this property and keep it open for families, groups, couples etc. to come and enjoy the Illinois River and gorgeous surroundings year-round. If we are able to finance this property we will have it up and running in time for Summer, even Memorial Day, so anyone willing can book a stay or event with us in time for Summer 2017.</p>
<p>Once we've gotten started, this property will allow for group camping (motorcycle clubs, boy/girl scouts, reunions, etc.), events and parties, overnight tent stays, honeymoon getaways and even weddings, which we already have experience hosting around Northwest Oklahoma. We currently have mobile entertainment service including a DJ and PA rentals. Any sort of event you can imagine will be possible on the riverside.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All we're in need of is assistance with a down payment and starting amenities. We've managed to negotiate a down payment that we can almost afford, and we're so close! All we need is a little kindness, faith and help from the community. In return, book your stay or event with us and have confidence we will make it memorable and worth-while.</p>
<p>To break it down, specific things we need include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Landscaping Equipment (Mower, weed eater, etc.)</li>
<li>Additional Furniture (TVs, Stands, Lamps, etc.)</li>
<li>Kitchen Amenities (Pots, pans, dishes, utensils, etc.)</li>
<li>Bathroom Amenities (Toilet paper, towels, rags, etc.)</li>
<li>Bedroom Fittings (Sheets, Blankets, Pillows etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal this will significantly delay our efforts, but believe we will find a way!</p>
<p>In the event we raise more than expected, your hard-earned money will not go to waste. Our future plans include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding several cabins of varying sizes and packages for cabin stays.</li>
<li>Adding bunks for group stays</li>
<li>Landscaping significantly to include waterways, diverse plant-life, etc.</li>
<li>Expanding our possibilities for weddings and similar events. A chapel/arch by a waterfall and reception area.</li>
<li>Bed and Breakfast amenities.</li>
<li>Spas or hot tubs for winter stays.</li>
<li>Deep swimming area against the riverbank.</li>
<li>And more ideas every day!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any endeavor like this, we face significant challenges. Your efforts will help greatly with these, of course, but our monthly expenses will need to be buffered by income. This means we have to be able to start up quickly to offset expenses. We feel as a family we are more than capable of this.</p>
<p>It is important to note that we will not provide floating opportunities, as we are unable to do this commercially. We will eventually provide private float opportunities and you are more than welcome to reserve a float through one of the resorts, just down the road!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You may not be able to contribute, and we respect that fully. But we still need your help! Share this with your friends and family, on your social media, get the word out!</p>

Why did We started?
 


 

Myself, I take care of six dogs and know is not easy to remember who was already fed and when was their last walk. Sometimes is difficult to balance a work and pet care. So we have studied have solve this problem.
We have studied many of times for Wellve design. The product of Users(dogs) is smart and cool design to Apple owner.

Since 2017, Wellve is alumni of GCCEI program - the Korea’s #1 Government Hardware Startup incubator. They’ve helped bringing over 100 products to market in the last 3 years with a lot of experience in this process. They help us with manufacturing to make sure everything goes smoothly with N15 acclerator. You can read more about N15 and GCCEI here.

1) Why is the Super Early Bird so cheap?It is too good to be true. What discounts can be expected after the Super Early Bird?
First of all, please trust the quality of Wellve. Our team members of Allfin, have worked in the IT industry for more than 10 years! We have more development experience for major brands such as Samsung, Hyundai, SKT, KT. Allfin has top tier engineers to develop these innovative AI products for you! We also work with our co-partners, one of Korea's leading telecom factories! And are assisted by our new co-partner in this camp. The most important thing is that we love your pet.
That’s why we offer surprisingly low prices for early bird specials. Even though we cannot cover the cost at this low price, it is super good to brand and benefit our first batch of fans. Of course, these discounts are so big that we can only offer a limited quantity at this price. Once the cost reaches the budget, the early bird discount will be gone. Super Early Bird benefits are the best discounts you can get – back Wellve now before it’s sold out!
 
2) When is the expected delivery?
We planned to start shipping in August. However, Wellve is so much more popular than we expected in Exhibitions. We are already in the process of production, and the expected shipping time will be in early Auguet. We will ship in batches.
 
3）What’s the IP rating of these products? Can my dog take a swimming with your Wellve?
By using a water-repellent sealing design and Waterproof USB-port, it keeps the inside of a device dry and fully functional, which means that Wellfit is sweat, rain and swim proof. We have designed it to be worn while swimming from the start. So there will be a Wellfit waterproof test video soon.
Wellfit, the dog collar, has been tested to IP7 rating, but our team generally makes conservative statements. You don't need to warry about your puppy playing on the water anymore. Wellve will surely bring you more surprises!!!
 
4) Are there plans for more colors to be offered?
We offer just two type color for our Wellve fans to choose our every new products. But during crowdfunding event, you can choose a one color, white.
 
5) What version Bluetooth does Wellve use?
Wellve uses Bluetooth LE 4.0.  Wellve Priemium uses both Bluetooth LE 4.2 and 5.0 since we are considering more devices that can connect to Bluetooth 5.0 in the near future. And our Bluetooth provides 128-bit security for your safety.
6) What is the warranty policy if I receive a defective set?
We value our users, and believe in our products. We tested all products before packaged. However, if there is a problem due to manufacturer's defect, we will replace it.

You can find your Order ID by logging in to your Indiegogo account and clicking on ‘My Contribution’If you login, you could see secret promotion event gift.
 
8) Why does it take 2 hours to charge the battery case？
We provide a USB charging cable for you to charge anywhere. 2 hours is the maximum charging time in case you charge from a low-voltage power source like computer’s USB port. So, in most cases, it takes less than 2 hours to get both the WellFit and WellFinder fully charged. 
 
9) What type of antenna do you use?
We use chip antenna and choose the small mobile devices. Although the cost of the chip antenna is higher than other types, the size, weight and stability for the multi-connection are better.
 
10) Can you manage more one dogs, and can you use a cat?
Yes, if you have multiple dogs, you may buy more WellFit to use with Wellfinder which allow you to manage up to 10 dogs. And our next product, Wellfinder home, can connect and have more control with longer distance.  If your lovely cat like pet collar or cloth, you can also use it. We provide the fashionable clothes for mini pet. And with this promotion, a mark can be changed to cat icon.
 
11) How can I change the color from white to others？
Indiegogo does allow you one color. Because Our Identity is White and Black color. WellFit color are couple with your base Apple products. But We will next products add new colors.
 
12）What’s the Wellve’s advantage of bass effect compared to other pet collar？
Our AI dynamic GPS pet collar is controlled by AWS Cloud System. It is designed to provide balanced data by taking advantage of battery life with outdoor activities. And with LoRa communication technology, you can use Wellve anywhere without monthly fees. So Wellve has a special technique and patents for long term battery effect. Because We think always with pets. Wellve is a design product to follow a pet's weight 1% under.

</div></div>","The KeyBiner is a more refined version of a time tested tool many have used to carry their essentials every day.  The biggest change was the addition of a unique key retention system, that allows you to keep your keys neatly organized and quiet.  We have also added several tools to aid you in your daily chores. The KeyBiner has no sharp edges to cut you or damage your clothing.
AVAILABLE IN 3 MATERIALS OF YOUR CHOICE:  Aluminum, Copper, and Titanium
