<p>Hello, we are Tosawi Saddler (Chippewa/Cree/Salish/Kootenai/Pend
d'Oreille) and Alecia Onzahwah (Absentee Shawnee/Kickapoo/Prairie Band
Potawatomi). Tosawi is currently a full time student pursuing a bachelor’s
degree in Computer Science. Alecia has 16 years combined experience in tribal
social services, employment and training, along with tribal child support. She is
currently a case worker and a student completing her associates’ degree in

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While attending a function in the community for
children, we noticed that there were few men present to support the children.
We discussed this dilemma and tried our best to understand why. We were never
able to come to a conclusion that explained the lack of involvement. That is
until shortly after, Alecia was fortunate enough to attend a conference where
NAFFA was presented in workshops and it was explained; that little attention
has been paid to the unique needs of Native men as they struggle to become
valuable family participants. Most services and programs focus primarily on the
needs of women and children.</p>
<p>Native Americans are feeling the impact of the erosion
and breakup of the family along with its great effects in our society. There is
an immediate need to bring Native American men back to strengthening families
by understanding that they are not the problem but rather the solution through
innate leadership abilities and recognizing the sacredness of families. The
Fatherhood is Sacred program is designed to strengthen individuals and families
by laying a strong foundation of direction and purpose in life. By filling life
with Hope, Gratitude and Understanding there is a powerful effect in attitude
and behavior change. It inspires and ignites self-motivation to bring that
change in a person.</p>

At the request of many
of the men in the Fatherhood is Sacred Program, and their desire for the
mothers to learn the same principles they were learning, Motherhood is Sacred
was developed. By sharing this vision between men and women, they work together
to bring happiness and safety to their families.<p></p>
<h4><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h4>
<p>Our intent is to help our communities and families by
offering this much needed program to any willing to accept it. Facilitator
training is $1800 per facilitator and it is necessary for a Fatherhood
facilitator along with a Motherhood facilitator to be certified to offer the
complete program. This training will cost $3600 for two facilitators one for
the Fatherhood and one for the Motherhood program. Facilitator
training/certification provides the facilitator the use of copyrighted
curriculum, tool kits and certifies the facilitator to implement the
Fatherhood/Motherhood is Sacred Programs. Once trained we will do whatever it
takes to initiate this program and offer it to the community. There will be
some expense in finding a facility to meet with participants, along with
materials necessary to provide the education. We believe a suitable location
will present itself once the community understands what we are trying to
accomplish. We are prepared to provide the materials necessary for the program
at our own expense if no support is found or provided through donations. If the
goal is not reached to pay for the training we will be providing the difference
at our own expense (it is that important to us!). Any additional monies
collected over the goal will be used for travel expenses to Mesa, AZ for the
training and to assist in implementation of the program.</p>
<p>We have seen many broken families and witnessed too many
of our young Native men growing up without a male authority figure or a healthy
example of what a Native father should and could be. Fatherhood is leadership;
one who leads and prepares the way for family and others by guiding, directing
and motivating. Native fathers are the greatest untapped resource for their
families and communities. With correct information and support they can find their
true potential. Desperation can be transformed into hope and discouragement
into self-worth and purpose. We are a great people and come from greatness, a
great heritage, history and culture. Greatness must start and be taught and
cultivated in the home! Parents must encourage their children to learn about
their forefathers and heritage. When we learn about our ancestors, what they
stood for, what they valued and what was important to them, we realize that we
have much in common. To honor the past we must improve upon the present.</p>
<p>We believe this is a much needed solution to the damage
and trauma caused by forced assimilation and attendance in residential boarding
schools. Native children that were forced to attend residential boarding
schools were never taught healthy parenting or nurturing. They in turn raised
their own children as best they could with the example that had been offered to
them. That example being the way they had been treated in the residential
boarding schools. This is a very personal issue for both of us as we were both
raised by survivors of residential Indian boarding schools. It is our dream and
goal to curb the cycle initiated by residential boarding schools and help
create models of healthy parenting for happy and safe Native families.</p>
<h4><b>The

<p>Program effectiveness will be evident as

We discussed this dilemma and tried our best to understand why. We were never
able to come to a conclusion that explained the lack of involvement. That is
until shortly after, Alecia was fortunate enough to attend a conference where
NAFFA was presented in workshops and it was explained; that little attention
has been paid to the unique needs of Native men as they struggle to become
valuable family participants. Most services and programs focus primarily on the
needs of women and children.
Native Americans are feeling the impact of the erosion
and breakup of the family along with its great effects in our society. There is
an immediate need to bring Native American men back to strengthening families
by understanding that they are not the problem but rather the solution through
innate leadership abilities and recognizing the sacredness of families. The
Fatherhood is Sacred program is designed to strengthen individuals and families
by laying a strong foundation of direction and purpose in life. By filling life
with Hope, Gratitude and Understanding there is a powerful effect in attitude
and behavior change. It inspires and ignites self-motivation to bring that
change in a person.

At the request of many
of the men in the Fatherhood is Sacred Program, and their desire for the
mothers to learn the same principles they were learning, Motherhood is Sacred
was developed. By sharing this vision between men and women, they work together
to bring happiness and safety to their families.
What
We Need & What You Get
Our intent is to help our communities and families by
offering this much needed program to any willing to accept it. Facilitator
training is $1800 per facilitator and it is necessary for a Fatherhood
facilitator along with a Motherhood facilitator to be certified to offer the
complete program. This training will cost $3600 for two facilitators one for
the Fatherhood and one for the Motherhood program. Facilitator
training/certification provides the facilitator the use of copyrighted
curriculum, tool kits and certifies the facilitator to implement the
Fatherhood/Motherhood is Sacred Programs. Once trained we will do whatever it
takes to initiate this program and offer it to the community. There will be
some expense in finding a facility to meet with participants, along with
materials necessary to provide the education. We believe a suitable location
will present itself once the community understands what we are trying to
accomplish. We are prepared to provide the materials necessary for the program
at our own expense if no support is found or provided through donations. If the
goal is not reached to pay for the training we will be providing the difference
at our own expense (it is that important to us!). Any additional monies
collected over the goal will be used for travel expenses to Mesa, AZ for the
training and to assist in implementation of the program.
We have seen many broken families and witnessed too many
of our young Native men growing up without a male authority figure or a healthy
example of what a Native father should and could be. Fatherhood is leadership;
one who leads and prepares the way for family and others by guiding, directing
and motivating. Native fathers are the greatest untapped resource for their
families and communities. With correct information and support they can find their
true potential. Desperation can be transformed into hope and discouragement
into self-worth and purpose. We are a great people and come from greatness, a
great heritage, history and culture. Greatness must start and be taught and
cultivated in the home! Parents must encourage their children to learn about
their forefathers and heritage. When we learn about our ancestors, what they
stood for, what they valued and what was important to them, we realize that we
have much in common. To honor the past we must improve upon the present.
We believe this is a much needed solution to the damage
and trauma caused by forced assimilation and attendance in residential boarding
schools. Native children that were forced to attend residential boarding
schools were never taught healthy parenting or nurturing. They in turn raised
their own children as best they could with the example that had been offered to
them. That example being the way they had been treated in the residential
boarding schools. This is a very personal issue for both of us as we were both
raised by survivors of residential Indian boarding schools. It is our dream and
goal to curb the cycle initiated by residential boarding schools and help
create models of healthy parenting for happy and safe Native families.
The

Promotes unity within community to help
families and individuals face life’s challenges



The
programs have been embraced by Native people, recommended by community and
government agencies, utilized by tribal programs and is recognized by the White
House as a leading resource for their fatherhood initiatives. This is a great
accomplishment; to date this has all been done without any support of
federal or state dollars.



100% of participants agree the program is useful in
their everyday parenting.


98% of men agree the Fatherhood is Sacred program helped
them grow not only as a father, but as a person as well.


99% agree the program helps them manage personal
behavior in a responsible way.


98% after completion of program felt motivated to be a
good father and understood a child’s need for love and security.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Zane has been tested and accepted into The Liberty School.  This school focuses on children with dyslexia and also children who are gifted and talented.  It has been a hard last three years getting Zane to want to read or do math.  He could tell you the history about anything you would ever want to know, but unfortunately he isn't reading at grade level.  Now, going into 4th grade, we face an uphill battle. Teachers have told me several times that Zane does better in small groups and at Liberty there are only 22 students. Liberty will truly be the ""freedom"" Zane needs to move on and become confident and proficient in math and reading; two of the most important skills to have.  By going to The Liberty School, Zane can attain the skills and tools he needs to learn despite of his dyslexia. He can then overcome his learning challenges and have those coping skills for the rest of his life.  I am committed to seeing my son become the best person he can be so that he may bring great things to our community and our world.</p>
<p>Liberty School has given Zane a 50% scholarship but we need to raise money for the rest. Any funds we receive that go beyond our goal will be given to The Liberty School for future tuition for Zane and other children in need of scholarships.</p>
<p>It's simple, the public school system isn't helping students or teachers.  Teachers want to give more attention to each individual student but can't because of large class sizes and lack of resources.  Students are not able to learn at their own pace and in their own way because they are being forced to do what everyone else is doing.  This type of learning doesn't work for those who are falling behind or for those who are way ahead. All families should have the option to give their children education in a way they enjoy and can understand. </p>

I currently attend Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle Washington <a href=""http://www.cornish.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cornish.edu/</a> and am working on my Bachelors of Fine Arts final art show. With your help I hope to raise $1500 for materials for the final pieces of my exhibit. </span></p><p>ABOUT ME</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Since I can remember, I’ve always had an interest in art. I remember spending time with my grandmother, a fine artist herself, to glean techniques and theories. My mother, a talented floral designer, also taught me about the process of work, repetition and composition from her incredible floral designs. Art truly became a crucial component of my life during high school; I started experimenting with painting and drawing and I realized my desire to deepen my knowledge. During my Sophomore year, I decided to transfer to Renaissance High School for the Arts, a visual and performing arts school, because I knew that was where my creativity would be supported and nourished. On registration day, I walked in with my transcripts and portfolio knowing they had already surpassed their attendance capacity for the year. I was convinced that this was where I was supposed to be. The principle recognized my eagerness to learn and saw my budding talent and welcome me to my new school.  I knew he was making an exception for me to attend so I was even more motivated to excel.</span></p><br/><p>My determination was tested every morning! I didn't live locally so it took two trains and a bus to get to school. During those daily two hour trips I learned about my endurance and resilience. My love for the arts was pushed, encouraged, and solidified and in this space I flourished. I learned to trust in my abilities. At Renaissance, I painted my first mural, inspired by Degas, and this is when I knew I could do anything I set my mind to. The Degas mural I painted was larger than life and very representative of his style. I was proud. I discovered in these two immersive years that I was very much in love with art and there was truly no other path I wanted to take. I knew my next step was to further my education by getting a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. </p><br/><p>In my search for art schools, I found Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle. Cornish specializes in visual and performing arts with a challenging program that stresses both concept and craft. When I was accepted my heart soared with excitement for the next adventure. I found myself at Cornish,18 years old, on my own, and 1,000 miles away from home. I was pushed more intensely than ever before and stretched emotionally and creatively far beyond my suspected boundaries/abilities. During this time of growth I discovered my love of sculpture and my intense compatibility with working three dimensionally. I worked with enthusiasm and created pieces that I’m excited to share with others!</p><br/><p>My primary inspiration for my work stems from the metaphor and poetry I see in nature. In my time at Cornish I learned to explore fascinations as a way of tapping into my creativity. My fascinations began with patterns, then transitioned to honeycomb, then focused on the life of bees. All of these interests can be found reflected in my work. </p><br/><p>My art is riddled with labor intensive processes that involve repetition and time. I’m fixated with the creation process and using my hands physically in my work. My work greatly deals with the emotions of one's journey through life. I speak much about death, pain and suffering, and the way in which processing through these trials can help us grow. But, also about the beauty and intricacies one can find by just slowing down, observing, and savoring.  I dialogue about meditation and silence as means of finding peace.  My recent pieces, “Tension” <a href=""http://vimeo.com/78384076"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/78384076</a> and “Release” <a href=""http://vimeo.com/78384401"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/78384401</a> illustrate the resistance of pain and trials and finding peace release through letting go.</p><br/><p>I’m now in my fourth and final year at Cornish. Quickly approaching is the Cornish Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) show. This career launching show is intended to be a reflection of all the knowledge I have gained throughout my Fine Arts education. It is important that the work I create is not only strong but representative of that. I feel that I’m ready to embark on this next journey with the skills that I have gained from my talented professors and classmates, but also with your help! I’m asking for your support to fund my final pieces for my BFA show. </p><br/><p> WHAT I NEED</p><br/><p>The materials that go into a work of art are expensive! I’m asking for $1500 for the materials and additional expenses towards my final pieces in my BFA.</p><br/><p>Expenses include:</p><br/><ul><li><p>$200-$500 for materials for each piece materials include things like wood, metal, paper stalk, resin and natural materials like tree branches, stumps, honey, honeycomb, beeswax, metal powders, and clay. I hope to have between 3-5  works in my show. </p></li></ul><br/><ul><li><p>$300 for expenses for framing, postcards, and business cards and documentation. </p></li></ul><br/><p> WHAT YOU GET</p><br/><p>If you contribute to my campaign there will be awesome perks!</p><br/><ul><li><p>$25 - I’ll send you a postcard of a piece of my work!</p></li></ul><br/><ul><li><p>$50 - I’ll send you weekly photos and email updates on my work in progress as well of sneak peaks of my studio/creation space!</p></li></ul><br/><ul><li><p>$100 - I'll send you a 11x14 high quality signed and dated photo print of a sculptural work!

I enjoy expressing myself through painting and sculpture. I currently attend Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle Washington http://www.cornish.edu/ and am working on my Bachelors of Fine Arts final art show. With your help I hope to raise $1500 for materials for the final pieces of my exhibit. ABOUT MESince I can remember, I’ve always had an interest in art. I remember spending time with my grandmother, a fine artist herself, to glean techniques and theories. My mother, a talented floral designer, also taught me about the process of work, repetition and composition from her incredible floral designs. Art truly became a crucial component of my life during high school; I started experimenting with painting and drawing and I realized my desire to deepen my knowledge. During my Sophomore year, I decided to transfer to Renaissance High School for the Arts, a visual and performing arts school, because I knew that was where my creativity would be supported and nourished. On registration day, I walked in with my transcripts and portfolio knowing they had already surpassed their attendance capacity for the year. I was convinced that this was where I was supposed to be. The principle recognized my eagerness to learn and saw my budding talent and welcome me to my new school.  I knew he was making an exception for me to attend so I was even more motivated to excel.My determination was tested every morning! I didn't live locally so it took two trains and a bus to get to school. During those daily two hour trips I learned about my endurance and resilience. My love for the arts was pushed, encouraged, and solidified and in this space I flourished. I learned to trust in my abilities. At Renaissance, I painted my first mural, inspired by Degas, and this is when I knew I could do anything I set my mind to. The Degas mural I painted was larger than life and very representative of his style. I was proud. I discovered in these two immersive years that I was very much in love with art and there was truly no other path I wanted to take. I knew my next step was to further my education by getting a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. In my search for art schools, I found Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle. Cornish specializes in visual and performing arts with a challenging program that stresses both concept and craft. When I was accepted my heart soared with excitement for the next adventure. I found myself at Cornish,18 years old, on my own, and 1,000 miles away from home. I was pushed more intensely than ever before and stretched emotionally and creatively far beyond my suspected boundaries/abilities. During this time of growth I discovered my love of sculpture and my intense compatibility with working three dimensionally. I worked with enthusiasm and created pieces that I’m excited to share with others!My primary inspiration for my work stems from the metaphor and poetry I see in nature. In my time at Cornish I learned to explore fascinations as a way of tapping into my creativity. My fascinations began with patterns, then transitioned to honeycomb, then focused on the life of bees. All of these interests can be found reflected in my work. My art is riddled with labor intensive processes that involve repetition and time. I’m fixated with the creation process and using my hands physically in my work. My work greatly deals with the emotions of one's journey through life. I speak much about death, pain and suffering, and the way in which processing through these trials can help us grow. But, also about the beauty and intricacies one can find by just slowing down, observing, and savoring.  I dialogue about meditation and silence as means of finding peace.  My recent pieces, “Tension” http://vimeo.com/78384076 and “Release” http://vimeo.com/78384401 illustrate the resistance of pain and trials and finding peace release through letting go.I’m now in my fourth and final year at Cornish. Quickly approaching is the Cornish Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) show. This career launching show is intended to be a reflection of all the knowledge I have gained throughout my Fine Arts education. It is important that the work I create is not only strong but representative of that. I feel that I’m ready to embark on this next journey with the skills that I have gained from my talented professors and classmates, but also with your help! I’m asking for your support to fund my final pieces for my BFA show.  WHAT I NEEDThe materials that go into a work of art are expensive! I’m asking for $1500 for the materials and additional expenses towards my final pieces in my BFA.Expenses include:$200-$500 for materials for each piece materials include things like wood, metal, paper stalk, resin and natural materials like tree branches, stumps, honey, honeycomb, beeswax, metal powders, and clay. I hope to have between 3-5  works in my show. $300 for expenses for framing, postcards, and business cards and documentation.  WHAT YOU GETIf you contribute to my campaign there will be awesome perks!$25 - I’ll send you a postcard of a piece of my work!$50 - I’ll send you weekly photos and email updates on my work in progress as well of sneak peaks of my studio/creation space!$100 - I'll send you a 11x14 high quality signed and dated photo print of a sculptural work! As well as weekly photos and email updates on my work progress! OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPIf you can’t contribute financially, that doesn’t mean you can’t help in other ways:You can share this with your friends, family, and co-workers who might be able to donate.Post my link on your social media sites (please!)Send lots of moral support my way during my last semester!My ability to attend Cornish College of the Arts has been nothing short of miraculous and a direct result of the generosity, love, and support of those who believe in me.

The goal of this one-month project is to generate discoveries and designs that will radically change technology in service of learners from all quarters. We are inviting the most extraordinary students from anywhere in the world to throw themselves into this mission for the month of January. 

Weâ€™ve already handpicked a few students from 4 countries who represent some of our worldâ€™s leading young computer scientists and designers. We need to fund them and to fund as many additional talented students as we can find. We will house selected students in the San Francisco Bay Area for as many days in January as they can stay. Theyâ€™ll work together in Palo Alto. Help Panafold make ELEM:ENT possible.

What will happen:
1. The ELEM:ENT crew will develop new technologies that engage people from all quarters in amazing learning experiences.2. The new learning technology will be inspired by edge learning communities, and edge factors: art, emotion, attention, and motivation. 3. If successful, the designs will be folded into eye-opening products that are accessible to broader segments of the globe. If we meet our goal, we will create extraordinary designs. If we surpass it, we will invite as many additional students into the process as we can. They are waiting! The students will learn from each other and from thought-leaders in the area.
What You Can Do:
1. Support us at any level. It really matters.2. Pass the word to a student or to faculty. (Quick, please!)3. If you are rethinking human learning, please get in contact: element.meg@gmail.com.Some of our inspirations include: Edgeperspectives by John Seely Brown and John Hagel and A New Culture of Learning by Douglas Thomas and JSB, this TEDx talkand work by Scott Snibbe and this one by Sir Ken Robinson as well as work by Clayton M. Christensen and collaborators, and the vision of Sal Khan.
Who We're Looking For:
 Students should have a strong desire to*build technologies that make people's lives better *connect with others across the globe *be inspired by actual human behavior, imperfect as it is*remember how to be playful and use computer science, engineering or design skills to invent the future

<h2>What We're Facing</h2>
<p>There is a problem, in the United States, that is quickly growing into a crisis. Student loan debt is an issue that could cripple our economy. Outstanding student loan debt is estimated to be between $900 billion and $1 trillion. The average outstanding college debt is over $26,600 and the average time to pay back a student loan is over 10 years. While new graduates are trying to establish themselves they are never fully engaged in the economy until they've paid back their student loans.</p>
<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<p>altrubanc was formed by a small group of friends and professionals. We have created a new way for students to connect with those that would like to help them succeed. We are a service, and an environment, in which students can get help from sponsors in order to pay for college. For a small annual fee students may exhibit their qualities, academic and other achievements, and plans in order to solicit help from sponsors. A student's profile may contain whatever information that student would like to include. That profile is available at all times and may be changed or updated whenever the student would like to do so.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>Sponsors do not pay to use altrubanc. A sponsor may have as much, or as little, to do with choosing beneficiaries of their altruism as they'd like. And every sponsor has our guarantee that 100% of support coming through altrubanc goes toward repayment of the chosen students' loans. A sponsor's support helps to alleviate the fear of financial debt of tomorrow as students see the support they're receiving today, allowing them to focus on their education. In the altrubanc system the student decides what information is included in her/his profile. There is space for profile photographs, school information, a biography, documents, letters, photographs- anything the student wants to share. This information is used to build a searchable database that a sponsor can use to find the right students. A sponsor can use any criteria at all to choose students. Maybe a sponsor doesn't want to consider grade point averages. Maybe a sponsor only wants to consider students in a particular field of study. altrubanc makes it easy for sponsors to find those students that they'd like to support. And sponsors don't have to worry about their money going toward individuals that have decided to misrepresent themselves academically. Student accounts are subject to verification.</p>
<p>Another feature of the altrubanc system is that we allow donations of any size from $20 to the entire total of a student's loan/s. Corporations can use altrubanc in addition to, or in place of, the traditional scholarship. Friends can give whenever they feel like helping a little. Grandparents, community groups, anybody can use altrubanc and any student using altrubanc can benefit from sponsors' altruistic spirit.</p>
<p>And we can't think of a better resource for companies to use when recruiting talent.</p>
<h2>Here's the Kicker</h2>
<p>We think that the previously mentioned features of our system make altrubanc a unique and valuable tool, but here are the ones that make it exceptional. Support cannot be mismanaged because neither the schools, nor the students ever touch the support. And in order for a student to benefit from sponors' support that student must fulfill two very basic requirements: the student must have provided truthful information, and the student must graduate. altrubanc pays directly to loan-holders after graduation.

What We're Facing
There is a problem, in the United States, that is quickly growing into a crisis. Student loan debt is an issue that could cripple our economy. Outstanding student loan debt is estimated to be between $900 billion and $1 trillion. The average outstanding college debt is over $26,600 and the average time to pay back a student loan is over 10 years. While new graduates are trying to establish themselves they are never fully engaged in the economy until they've paid back their student loans.
Our Solution
altrubanc was formed by a small group of friends and professionals. We have created a new way for students to connect with those that would like to help them succeed. We are a service, and an environment, in which students can get help from sponsors in order to pay for college. For a small annual fee students may exhibit their qualities, academic and other achievements, and plans in order to solicit help from sponsors. A student's profile may contain whatever information that student would like to include. That profile is available at all times and may be changed or updated whenever the student would like to do so.
How it Works
Sponsors do not pay to use altrubanc. A sponsor may have as much, or as little, to do with choosing beneficiaries of their altruism as they'd like. And every sponsor has our guarantee that 100% of support coming through altrubanc goes toward repayment of the chosen students' loans. A sponsor's support helps to alleviate the fear of financial debt of tomorrow as students see the support they're receiving today, allowing them to focus on their education. In the altrubanc system the student decides what information is included in her/his profile. There is space for profile photographs, school information, a biography, documents, letters, photographs- anything the student wants to share. This information is used to build a searchable database that a sponsor can use to find the right students. A sponsor can use any criteria at all to choose students. Maybe a sponsor doesn't want to consider grade point averages. Maybe a sponsor only wants to consider students in a particular field of study. altrubanc makes it easy for sponsors to find those students that they'd like to support. And sponsors don't have to worry about their money going toward individuals that have decided to misrepresent themselves academically. Student accounts are subject to verification.
Another feature of the altrubanc system is that we allow donations of any size from $20 to the entire total of a student's loan/s. Corporations can use altrubanc in addition to, or in place of, the traditional scholarship. Friends can give whenever they feel like helping a little. Grandparents, community groups, anybody can use altrubanc and any student using altrubanc can benefit from sponsors' altruistic spirit.
And we can't think of a better resource for companies to use when recruiting talent.
Here's the Kicker
We think that the previously mentioned features of our system make altrubanc a unique and valuable tool, but here are the ones that make it exceptional. Support cannot be mismanaged because neither the schools, nor the students ever touch the support. And in order for a student to benefit from sponors' support that student must fulfill two very basic requirements: the student must have provided truthful information, and the student must graduate. altrubanc pays directly to loan-holders after graduation. In the case that a student does not fulfill the basic requirements all the support associated with that student goes back to sponsors' accounts to be reallocated to other students. These features set altrubanc apart from any other method of paying for higher education.
The Campaign and Your Impact

Please keep in mind that we can receive any amount as a donation. At most donation levels we offer, as perks, one-year memberships that can be given to students.

<p><strong>Trollhiem LLC</strong> is a new company dedicated to teaching traditional crafts, experimental archeology and having a place to hold living history events for all time frames and cultures. To this end the plan is for Trollhiem LLC to use a site in EarlyCountyGeorgia as a school for traditional crafts and a living history campground.  This is our first step to developing the school and campground.</p>
<p> The company was founded by Jim Revells, who has been actively involved in living history for almost thirty years, and his daughter Sonja Revells, a professional photographer. </p>
<p>Jim is known in the Society for Creative Anachronism as Baron Olaf of Trollhiemsfjord.  Within the SCA he has received awards for serving of authentic, but tasty, period meals and for his work in metalsmithing (the Maunche). One of the events he started, ""A Market Day at Birka"" has been run for over twenty years (See: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbirka.org%2F&amp;h=kAQFr-98I&amp;s=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://birka.org/</a>) another event he started, ""Metalsmiths Symposium"" has been run over nine times. (See: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fekmg.eastkingdom.org%2Fmss%2F&amp;h=IAQFvZ0Dx&amp;s=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://ekmg.eastkingdom.org/mss/</a>). He has also participated in many Fur Trade era events and Renaissance Faires around the eastern US.  Jim is also a modern jeweler and metalsmith.</p>
<p>Sonja is an award winning news and fine art photographer who has traveled extensively.  During a four month backpacking trek she visited China, Tibet, (where she visited Mount Everest) Nepal, Thailand, Japan and Israel.  She has also visited England, France, Italy, Spain, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico on other trips. You can find out more about us on our Facebook pages: Trollhiem LLC or Sonja Revells Photography or Olaf Trollhiemsfjord</p>
<p>We are seeking funds to get our business “on the road” quite literally. We will buy a used school bus and convert it into a camper for traveling all through the United States and Canada. Along with the bus we need some tents, to hold classes in; funds to travel with; tools and camp equipment; a lap top computer; funds to help Jim relocate from New Hampshire to Georgia and finally to install electricity and data communications at our workshops in Georgia.  The bus will be a means of generating interest in our school and campground, as well as generating income by sales of items made in our workshops.  The travel will also allow Sonja to take all sorts of interesting photos.  We will be on the road from one to three weeks each month.</p>
<p>This is not a project that banks or venture capitalists are interested in funding, so we are seeking our funding from people who like our idea.  Jim will attend living history events demonstrating and teaching Viking Age metalsmithing.  We will also be looking for schools that want to have classes on low tech metal casting.  More detailed schedule information is available on the Trollhiem LLC Facebook page.</p>
<p>If we don’t manage to get full funding for this attempt we will put whatever we receive into getting the bus and equipment then try another campaign to raise additional funds.  All the funds will be used to move our plans forward.</p>
<p>Many of the premiums will feature the images that Sonja captures along the road as we go from historic sites to activities at living history events.  The tee shirts, mouse pad and bumper stickers will feature designs by Jim.   The monthly news letter will include photos from the road, commentary by both Jim and Sonja about out trips and what is going on at the workshops as well as commentary by guest and interviews with people along the way.  My granddaughters (seven year old Dalayna and eleven year old Daryan) may even give their opinion on events from time to time.</p>
<p>Most of our premiums are fairly standard, but since Jim is an old Submariner, how does being a ""Plank Owner"" sound? It is an old Navy tradition, if you are a member of the first crew aboard a Boat/Ship you are a ""Plank Owner”. Since anyone that supports us this early in the game is truly helping us get the ""Boat"" underway. There is a limit of 500 ""Plank Owners"" who will have their name carved into the wood paneling of the bus and receive a certificate that they are a ""Plank Owner"" with a photo map of where it is placed.</p>

<h2>The students from Shelter Island School have sailed with the students from Block Island and Fisher's Island<strong> for a dozen years.</strong>

<p>We are students at The Art Institute of Tampa.  Our Editorial Photography class is running a blog called <a href=""http://isoloveflorida.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ISOLoveFlorida</a> that will showcase interesting places to visit in Florida.  We are hoping to raise the funds needed to publish some of our best works from the quarter into a 40-page magazine.  This magazine will be a physical culmination of the quarter, and serve to showcase what we've accomplished during our class.   Due to the high cost of publishing and the low income of college students, the only way we can achieve this goal is through donations from people like you.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To have 150 copies of our magazine made, we were quoted a price of $800.  The entirety of this money would go to the publishing costs we were quoted.  The additional $50 is for IndieGogo fees.<br/></p>
<p>As incentives for donations, we will be offering signed copies of the magazine, printed thank you's and much more!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, the funds will still go entirely to publishing costs.  The students of the class will be splitting the costs of any funds not obtained.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why Donate</h3>
<p>Throughout the quarter, we will be learning Editorial Photography and showcasing that work on our blog.  You can look through the blog, periodically, to get an idea of the type of work that will make the magazine.  Your contributions will be helping us distribute our work, as well as showcasing interesting places in Florida.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As of right now, our class of 10 students will have to come up with $100 each to cover publishing costs.  That is quite the task for college students, so we made the collective decision to reach out to the public.  Every dollar donated to our campaign helps to alleviate the costs we need for publishing.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal, then we still use the funds for publishing and that will help us to diminish our out of pocket expenses for publishing.</p>
<p>If we are able to reach more than our goal, then we will be able to publish more copies to spread our work further!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you are like us and don't have the funds to donate directly, then simply sharing this with your friends and family can help make an impact!  If you can help us get the word out to people who can donate to our cause, then its like donating indirectly!  Thank you for your time and consideration!<br/></p>

  What We Need & What You Get To have 150 copies of our magazine made, we were quoted a price of $800.  The entirety of this money would go to the publishing costs we were quoted.  The additional $50 is for IndieGogo fees.
As incentives for donations, we will be offering signed copies of the magazine, printed thank you's and much more!
If we do not reach our goal, the funds will still go entirely to publishing costs.  The students of the class will be splitting the costs of any funds not obtained.
  Why Donate
Throughout the quarter, we will be learning Editorial Photography and showcasing that work on our blog.  You can look through the blog, periodically, to get an idea of the type of work that will make the magazine.  Your contributions will be helping us distribute our work, as well as showcasing interesting places in Florida.
  Risks & Challenges As of right now, our class of 10 students will have to come up with $100 each to cover publishing costs.  That is quite the task for college students, so we made the collective decision to reach out to the public.  Every dollar donated to our campaign helps to alleviate the costs we need for publishing.
If we are unable to reach our goal, then we still use the funds for publishing and that will help us to diminish our out of pocket expenses for publishing.
If we are able to reach more than our goal, then we will be able to publish more copies to spread our work further!
  Other Ways You Can Help If you are like us and don't have the funds to donate directly, then simply sharing this with your friends and family can help make an impact!  If you can help us get the word out to people who can donate to our cause, then its like donating indirectly!  Thank you for your time and consideration!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","WHY YOGA?

It's simple really.  I love yoga, and I love what it has done for me.  I want to help others experience that same joy and transformation.
 
When I started doing yoga about five years ago my life changed.  I began to love and respect my body in new ways.  I began seeing myself as someone who is strong, graceful and beautiful.  And I saw the transformation in my fellow classmates and knew that I must do this!  I must share what I have learned!  I must teach yoga!
 
WHAT CAN I DO WITH YOGA?
I believe this world can be transformed into a peaceful place of community and caring through love. And I believe yoga is a powerful tool for this transformation. It obviously helps physically, but the mental tranquility it offers is near miraculous.  There is a peace, a quiet...a me that I really love... as I move through life as a yogini.
 
My goal as a yoga teacher will be to share this beautiful gift with others by creating and facilitating workshops and retreats.  (I currently co-facilitate a fiber art workshop.  Being able to teach yoga will allow me to add another dimension of self exploration to this class.)
 
I also plan to volunteer my time to teaching yoga both 1:1 and in group settings to two populations I have served for the last 17 years--people with developmental disabilities and people who have experienced trauma in their lives.
 
WHAT DO I NEED?
I am registering for The Samarya Center’s Yoga Teacher Training.  This is an amazing non-profit committed to making yoga accessible to everyone.  The amount I originally thought I would need for the training is $3350.  
HOWEVER!!!!  GREAT NEWS!!!!  I applied for and was given the blessing of a scholarship and now what I need to raise is $1650 which must be paid in full by September 9th.  
This scholarship was such an amazing & surprising gift, I know I have just over 30 days to raise the dollars to make this dream come true....but I couldn't turn down this opportunity.  Most teacher training programs are between $3000-5000 buckaroos...and the cost has been an obstacle for several years.  I've wanted this for so long; it just feels like the right time.  So, I am considering this a lesson in overcoming my deeply ingrained ""I can do it myself"" story and putting this out into the big wild Universe to see what can happen.
 
WHAT YOU CAN DO?

<h2>Bring Boy's Rites of Passage Programs to Ithaca!</h2>
<p>My name is Pierce Walsh ....I have been a nature educator, working with youth in the Ithaca area for the last 12 years with Primitive Pursuits and Earth Arts.  My wife Jenny and I have two sons and a daughter. I feel it is incredibly important  to create a Nature-based rites of passage program, for boys, teens, and men. I believe that allowing the boys the opportunity to transition into manhood this way will feed back to the whole community and benefit us all.</p>
<h2>Why Rites of Passage for Boys?</h2>
<p>Stories form the fabric of our communities. We all want to have stories to tell -- stories of times when we acted bravely or wisely, amusing stories, poignant ones. Adolescent boys are no different -- for many, stories of tragedy narrowly-averted, or of challenges overcome are the ones they like to tell the most. ""I got this scar when I....."" In their lives, many teenage boys look for high-adrenaline situations that force them to walk up to the boundaries of convention to discover what might happen and how they will get through.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, when we lived closer to the land and closer together, the situations in which we lived provided young boys with just these types of challenges. Adolescents were called upon to hunt and to help protect the clan from dangerous animals or rival clans. The elder males of the clan mentored them in the particulars of adult responsibilities and, when they were ready, the elders presented them with guided challenges for them to overcome. These were their initiation rites -- their rites of passage into adulthood, that brought them not only into new roles in the clan, but also, a new sense of self. And sitting around the fire, they had the battlescars and stories to share.</p>
<p>In our modern lives, young boys don't have these important roles to play. We don't offer a place for them to put their hunter/warrior spirits to the test. We don't have important and adrenaline-filled tasks for them to fulfill, for the sake of feeding or protecting their families. But yet, they still have these spirits inside of them, and they still have the need to prove themselves and that need for stories to tell. It is no wonder many look to unsafe, unhealthy situations to meet some of this need. Such situations provide them with the exciting experiences and the stories they so crave.</p>
<p>But if the community provided them with nature-based survival challenges, if we gave them mentors who taught them wilderness skills and challenged them to push themselves to their limits, if we placed them in challenging and exciting yet safe, contolled situations that required them to use their skills, their intuitions, their minds, and their spirits, these would be their stories.</p>
<p>My goal, with this program is to create healthy outlets for that primal human need for powerful experiences, in a mentored context. During these programs, we can open the boys up to the possibility of exploring who they are and how they can use their wilderness skills and gifts in their proper place. The mentors and elders help them to process the experiences so that in the telling of the story, there are also the questions of what the experience taught them about a particular part of themselves, and about how it can translate to their lives and their community.We look to create a sensitivity and awareness in our boys so they can grow into who they are truly meant to be.</p>
<p>I am personally so grateful to my aunt Lydia and uncle Dan, who helped me have these kinds of opportunities in my life. If they had not stepped in to help me out of the rut I was finding myself in as a young teen, things would have been different. I am sure my life would not have been as rich, and full of meaning as it has been. I still love to tell the story of my face-off with a wolverine in Alaska, or the time my friends and I helped each other ford the raging stream, and of the ways in which my mentors guided me through and helped me know myself in ways I never would have!</p>
<h2>You Can Help Make This Happen!</h2>
</div>
<h3><em><strong>I am incredibly excited to bring this type of programming to the Ithaca area for the boys and men of our community. But I need your help!</strong></em></h3>
<p>The first step to getting this all started is for me to attend a Sacred Fire training workshop this month. In this workshop, with the guidance of mentors Michael Trotta of Sagefire Institute (<a href=""http://www.sagefire.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sagefire.com</a>), and Mark Morey of the Institute for Natural Learning (<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.ifnaturallearning.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ifnaturallearning.com</a></span>)<strong>, </strong>I will experience, first hand, what the boys and men in our programs will experience.<strong></strong></p>

</div></div>","Bring Boy's Rites of Passage Programs to Ithaca!
My name is Pierce Walsh ....I have been a nature educator, working with youth in the Ithaca area for the last 12 years with Primitive Pursuits and Earth Arts.  My wife Jenny and I have two sons and a daughter. I feel it is incredibly important  to create a Nature-based rites of passage program, for boys, teens, and men. I believe that allowing the boys the opportunity to transition into manhood this way will feed back to the whole community and benefit us all.
Why Rites of Passage for Boys?
Stories form the fabric of our communities. We all want to have stories to tell -- stories of times when we acted bravely or wisely, amusing stories, poignant ones. Adolescent boys are no different -- for many, stories of tragedy narrowly-averted, or of challenges overcome are the ones they like to tell the most. ""I got this scar when I....."" In their lives, many teenage boys look for high-adrenaline situations that force them to walk up to the boundaries of convention to discover what might happen and how they will get through.
Once upon a time, when we lived closer to the land and closer together, the situations in which we lived provided young boys with just these types of challenges. Adolescents were called upon to hunt and to help protect the clan from dangerous animals or rival clans. The elder males of the clan mentored them in the particulars of adult responsibilities and, when they were ready, the elders presented them with guided challenges for them to overcome. These were their initiation rites -- their rites of passage into adulthood, that brought them not only into new roles in the clan, but also, a new sense of self. And sitting around the fire, they had the battlescars and stories to share.
In our modern lives, young boys don't have these important roles to play. We don't offer a place for them to put their hunter/warrior spirits to the test. We don't have important and adrenaline-filled tasks for them to fulfill, for the sake of feeding or protecting their families. But yet, they still have these spirits inside of them, and they still have the need to prove themselves and that need for stories to tell. It is no wonder many look to unsafe, unhealthy situations to meet some of this need. Such situations provide them with the exciting experiences and the stories they so crave.
But if the community provided them with nature-based survival challenges, if we gave them mentors who taught them wilderness skills and challenged them to push themselves to their limits, if we placed them in challenging and exciting yet safe, contolled situations that required them to use their skills, their intuitions, their minds, and their spirits, these would be their stories.
My goal, with this program is to create healthy outlets for that primal human need for powerful experiences, in a mentored context. During these programs, we can open the boys up to the possibility of exploring who they are and how they can use their wilderness skills and gifts in their proper place. The mentors and elders help them to process the experiences so that in the telling of the story, there are also the questions of what the experience taught them about a particular part of themselves, and about how it can translate to their lives and their community.We look to create a sensitivity and awareness in our boys so they can grow into who they are truly meant to be.
I am personally so grateful to my aunt Lydia and uncle Dan, who helped me have these kinds of opportunities in my life. If they had not stepped in to help me out of the rut I was finding myself in as a young teen, things would have been different. I am sure my life would not have been as rich, and full of meaning as it has been. I still love to tell the story of my face-off with a wolverine in Alaska, or the time my friends and I helped each other ford the raging stream, and of the ways in which my mentors guided me through and helped me know myself in ways I never would have!
You Can Help Make This Happen!

I am incredibly excited to bring this type of programming to the Ithaca area for the boys and men of our community. But I need your help!
The first step to getting this all started is for me to attend a Sacred Fire training workshop this month. In this workshop, with the guidance of mentors Michael Trotta of Sagefire Institute (www.sagefire.com), and Mark Morey of the Institute for Natural Learning (www.ifnaturallearning.com), I will experience, first hand, what the boys and men in our programs will experience.
The training and associated costs are $900. Every single donation helps, no matter how small! 
This small investment by our community will help get me on the road to being fully trained so I can begin working with our boys on this new frontier.
Anyone who donates $100 or more will be eligible to join the ""Afternoon With Pierce in the Woods."" For $50 or more, you can get your very own, hand-carved two-person bow drill kit with a link to an instructional video on making friction fires.

After graduating from Middle School in 2006 I became a People to People Student Ambassador and had the opportunity to travel to England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. This was a HUGE step for me, leaving my mother and my little brother and taking part in a trip with no one I knew, and at the young age of just 16. Of course the trip ended up being amazing and I was able to learn so much about these countries in the short amount of time I was living there. By the end of the trip I yearned for more. As I entered high school I knew I wanted to take French classes so that one day I would be able to travel to France to live, learn, and explore. After 3 years of french classes in high school, as the French Honor Society President, I persuaded my teacher to take us on a trip to France. Excited and eager to put my french language to use I began planning for the trip. Sadly, the trip was quickly canceled due to the lack of participation from the other students. Although disappointed I continued on with my french language classes and became well versed by the end of high school.Beginning college, I continued to study the french language. I have really developed a strong passion for not only the language but the culture as well. I am currently in my 3rd college level french class and loving every minute of it. I have searched for years to find a trip to join so that I may finally reach my dream of visiting France and getting to enhance my french language speaking skills. What better way to become fluent, then to immerse yourself in the culture and the language. My Trip!This year my college is finally offering a trip to France and Spain. This trip focuses mostly on the food, wine, and hospitality aspects of the other countries. An AMAZING opportunity to explore the countries, and get a chance to taste what the countries have to offer.
I can think of nothing else but going on this trip and finally getting to see France and all that I have been studying for the last 6 plus years.To do that I NEED YOUR HELP!A trip like this is expensive. I will be doing the trip through the University as a summer class and will be there for two weeks. The total trip is over $4000 and I am unable to pay it without your help!As I prepare for a trip like this, I can think of nothing but my future as I will enhance my knowledge, language and speaking skills. Thus one day, being so fluent in French that I won't only be able to help English speaking children, but French speaking children as well.Other Ways You Can HelpI know that sometimes money is not available to give. Would you please share my site with your friends and family? All donations will help and every dollar will get me that much closer to going on a trip that I have hoped for, for many many years.MERCI! GRACIAS!Thank you so much for your consideration and I look forward to sending you postcards from France and Spain!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello,   I’m Gary McMullan and would like to welcome you to “Crosses for Cause”.  The cause that I am working toward is Agape Christian Academy, a non-profit private school in Corsicana, Texas.  Agape Christian Academy opened in 2008 after my wife had been homeschooling our daughter and some ohther kids in our home for several years.  When she had 53 kids and 5 theachers in our home, we recognized that there was a need for Christian education that wasn't being met in our town.  God led us to meet this need.  Our school is a 501 (c) 3 non profit and is accreditied br the National Association of Private Schools.  Learn more about Agape Christian Academy at <a href=""http://www.agapecorsicana.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.agapecorsicana.org</a></p>
<p>Our students come from a wide variety of backgrounds.  Some families are able to pay their tuition without a problem, some families struggle every month, and some families just can't do it at all.  Many have been hit by hardships such as job loss, cancer, and divorce.  All need  the special love and guidence that they can't get in public school.  These are the children we are asking you to help.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising and unusual features of our school is that all of our teachers and administrators are volunteers.  They work, full-time, for no compensation except tuition for their children.  All tuition moneys are turned directly back to providing for our students.  We are simply a school on mission to share the love of Christ through education.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Our primary goal is to raise funding for scholarships for 9 students.  Tuition and fees for one student run $3250 for the year, which makes our goal for all 9 students equal $29250.</p>
<h4>In exchange for your donation of $30-$35 or more, you will receive a hand-crafted cross.  I began making these crosses as gifts for family and friends, and now I am making them to thank you for your sacrifice in helping these children.  All donations are tax deductable.</h4>
<p>As a Christian, the cross is a reminder that Jesus suffered and died because of our sin, so that we could have eternal life.  John 3:16 says “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life”.  Jesus was crucified as a sinner, stripped of his glory, and nailed to the cross as if he was a convict.   It is for this reason that I make most of my crosses roughed up.  Although they are made with great love, I don’t try to make them perfect.  Hand cut on a band saw and table saw, I don’t measure my cuts on purpose; I just “eyeball” the dimensions, fit and glue the cross piece to the upright.   I then use a small sanding drum to “rough up” the sides of the wood to resemble rough cut timbers, which I feel is how the original cross was.  Every piece of wood has a unique grain; I like to think of it as a “fingerprint” developed by the growth of the tree and all of the influences that effect its growth.  Each of the crosses is sprayed with a clear gloss finish that helps bring out the colors and gains of the wood and to protect from weather or turning dark.  I have also made a few one of a kind items like the three crosses above from mesquite which has a deep reddish brown color and is native to our area hear in central Texas.</p>
<p>For those of you who are feeling even more generous and able to support our cause, for a donation of $1000 or more, we will inscribe your name or the name of your loved one on our plaque of honor.  This plaque will recognize your selfless support of our ministry.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have been very blessed financially and moved by the mission of Agape Christian Academy, we will dedicate the building in your name or the name of your most loved one for a gift of $275,000.00 to pay off the building.  A 12x12 brass plaque will be placed by the front doors and the name placed on the front awning.</p>
<p><strong>Why You Should Get Involved</strong></p>
<p>The value of a Christian education cannot be taken for granted.  Public schools are able to provide for a child’s academic education, but cannot provide for a spiritual education.  Christian schools are able to fill this gap.  At Agape Christian Academy, children are immersed in a Christian environment, taught from a Christian worldview, and loved with the unconditional love of Christ.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that if a person does not accept Christ by the age of 18, there is a 94% probability that he never will.  In fact, 83% of all Christians make their decision to follow Christ between the ages of 4 and 14.  By supporting our ministry, you will help us to reach these children during this critical time period. </p>

<h3><em>On my first day of preschool another child quickly placed the tower of blocks in my profile picture correctly.  He wanted to share and asked me to help, but I didn't know how....</em></h3>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p><strong><em>Please help me to beat the odds and not be a negative statistic for FAS and prenatal drug abuse.</em></strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/199204_1016446065308_9049_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 604px; height: 453px;""/></p>
<p><em><strong>This is me when I was born.  My apgar score was only 1 and I needed lots of care.</strong></em></p>
<p>My name is Evelynne and I am turning 4 years old this Summer!  My teenaged birth mom drank alcohol and used Meth Amphetamine, Cocaine, Marijuana and Tobacco when she was pregnant with me.  My mommy's placenta abrupted and I was born 6 weeks early and I was very sick.  The social workers took me away from my mom and I never had a chance to breast feed, so they fed me formula, but nobody knew I was allergic to cow protein.  Becuase my gastrointestional system was not developed I could not process the formula and when I was 2 months old I went into anaphylactic shock and my temperature dropped down to 95 degrees and I started bleeding out all my orifices.  I needed life support, and blood and plasma transfusions to survive and I had to stay in the hospital intensive care for over a month to get better.</p>
<p>Finally I was well enough to go home to my foster family, but the exposure to drugs and alcohol in utero and all the time it took me to get better when I was a baby has left me developmentally delayed.  I am pretty high functioning, but I need a lot of help to catch up to other kids my age so I can one day hope to function independantly in school without needing a teacher's aid and maybe go to university one day!</p>
<p>My Grandma and Grandpa take care of me now and they love me very much, but they don't have much money.  They put me in a montessori school for most of the year, but had to pull me out of school in April because they couldn't afford to keep making the payments to the school. </p>
<p>My Grandparents would like to put me back in a montessori program in the Fall because this program works specifically on helping me develop the skills that I am delayed in and teaches me structure.  I have a very hard time focussing and sociallizing properly in groups so this environment is very important to develop my social skills too.  Montessori also allows me to learn at my own pace and treats me like the unique person I am.  My Grandparents want to give me the best advantage so that when I get to grade school I will be able to function just like the other kids do in a class and not be on a wait list for a teacher's aid.</p>
<p>Please help me go to a school that can help me develop all my skills.  I am almost 4, but I still can't say or read the whole alphabet or count/read numbers very well.  I still can't draw/copy simple shapes or write any letters either.  I need help with developing my motor skills and with my social development.  I know I can catch up to the other kids, but I just need a lot of extra help and a program that helps me with structure and developing all these skills I need for grade school.  I want to be the same as the other kids my age.</p>
<p>The doctor's are not sure how the exposure to drugs and alcohol in utero will affect me in the long term, so I need all the help I can get while I am little to help me grow strong and smart and do well in school and become an independant, productive member of society when I am all grown up.  These early years are so important to me.  Please help me have the best chance at life, because I am a great kid and every kid deserves a chance to learn and be the best they can be!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your help you will know that you are helping me to get the best start that I can at life.  You give me the gift of early childhood education which will give me the best chance that I could ever have to grow and learn like other kids, to excel into my adulthood, and become a productive member of society who will help lead the way into the future alongside my peers, and to one day nuture my own children the best that I possibly can.  I already have the love and stability of my family.  All I need now is some help with my education during the most important learning years of my life!</p>

<li>$200 Registration Fee</li>
<li>$200 School Uniform and Clothing for the year</li>
<li>$45 School Supplies</li>
</ul><p><strong>What Happens if Funds Fall Short or Exceed the Goal? </strong></p>
<p>If funding falls short it will be determined if there is enough to still send Evelynne to preschool even if it is just regular preschool.  It will depend on how much is raised to determine if it is enough to still send her to montessori, and if not if there is enough to send her to regular preschool.</p>
<p>If funds exceed the goal, funding will be put into drama classes for Evelynne as she has always been very animated, using all kinds of gestures, facial expressions, different tones to her voice, etc, since infancy.  She has a magnetic personality that captures people's attention and she has expressed an interest in taking drama.</p>
<p>If only a very small amount of money is raised and it isn't enough to commit to preschool, then those funds will be put towards some kind of creative classes for Evelynne at the community centre.  Could be dance, music or drama; whatever is offered at the time. </p>

<p>""Early gains in school readiness due to early childhood education have been shown to have enormous positive economic and social impacts lasting well into adulthood, from higher educational attainment and less chance of involvement in criminal activity, to higher status employment and higher earnings (Schweinhart 2007; Sparling, Ramey and Ramey 2007.... Heckman concludes, ""We cannot afford to postpone investing in children until they become adults, nor can we wait until they reach school age—a time when it may be too late to intervene. Learning is a dynamic process and is most effective when it begins at a young age and continues through to adulthood."" (Heckman 2000, pg. 50)</p>
<p>""While no single curriculum or pedagogical approach can be identified as best, children who attend well-planned, high-quality ECE programs in which the curriculum aims are specified and integrated across domains tend to learn more and are better prepared to master the complex demands of formal schooling.""

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Montesorri?</strong></p>
<p>""Dr. Maria Montessori was a doctor who worked with developmentally delayed children in Rome. She discovered that if she observed children she could discover much about what they needed in order to learn and flourish. Montessori was one of the first people to see the importance of observing children in order to plan an appropriate environment and curriculum to meet their needs....</p>
<p>Dr. Montessori identified four “planes of development,” with each stage having its own developmental characteristics and developmental challenges. The Early Childhood Montessori environment for children age three to six is designed to work with the “absorbent mind,” “sensitive periods,” and the tendencies of children at this stage of their development.</p>
<p>Learning that takes place during these years comes spontaneously without effort, leading children to enter the elementary classes with a clear, concrete sense of many abstract concepts. Montessori helps children to become self-motivated, self-disciplined, and to retain the sense of curiosity that so many children lose along the way in traditional classrooms. They tend to act with care and respect toward their environment and each other. They are able to work at their own pace and ability. The three-year Montessori experience tends to nurture a joy of learning that prepares them for further challenges.""</p>

<h3>A Word from my Grandma</h3>
<p>When I was younger I was in foster care and at the age of 23 I became a mother.  My baby's father was abusive and I ended up a single mom.  The only person in the world I had to help me was a man I had met in my foster home and was like a dad to me.  This man ended up sexually abusing my child for years before she disclosed her abuse.  Despite many years of counselling my daughter was not able to cope with her abuse and she became addicted to drugs at the age of 12.</p>
<p>Please help me give every advantage I can to my granddaughter by helping with her early childhood education so she may overcome her developmental delays and reach the milestones she needs to succeed in grade school.  Please help me to give her the chance at life that my daughter never had.  My heart has already been so terribly broken and I need to do all that I can to ensure that Evelynne flourishes and has the happiest life ever!</p>
<p>I have been on disability for years since finding out what happened to my daughter as I still face many challenges with her addiction and not knowing where she is all the time... my husband is on his Canada Pension due to osteo arthritis and we also care for his adult daughter who is more severely developmentally delayed and unable to work.  Taking on Evelynne has been a huge additional expense for us and we just can't afford anything more than her basic care.</p>
<p>She is one very special little girl who has beat the odds so far, and has every opportunity to overcome her current disabilities if we just invest in her.</p>

<p><strong>Big sister Marina feeding Evelynne her Special Formula During her First Christmas!</strong></p></div>","On my first day of preschool another child quickly placed the tower of blocks in my profile picture correctly.  He wanted to share and asked me to help, but I didn't know how....
 
My Story
Please help me to beat the odds and not be a negative statistic for FAS and prenatal drug abuse.

This is me when I was born.  My apgar score was only 1 and I needed lots of care.
My name is Evelynne and I am turning 4 years old this Summer!  My teenaged birth mom drank alcohol and used Meth Amphetamine, Cocaine, Marijuana and Tobacco when she was pregnant with me.  My mommy's placenta abrupted and I was born 6 weeks early and I was very sick.  The social workers took me away from my mom and I never had a chance to breast feed, so they fed me formula, but nobody knew I was allergic to cow protein.  Becuase my gastrointestional system was not developed I could not process the formula and when I was 2 months old I went into anaphylactic shock and my temperature dropped down to 95 degrees and I started bleeding out all my orifices.  I needed life support, and blood and plasma transfusions to survive and I had to stay in the hospital intensive care for over a month to get better.
Finally I was well enough to go home to my foster family, but the exposure to drugs and alcohol in utero and all the time it took me to get better when I was a baby has left me developmentally delayed.  I am pretty high functioning, but I need a lot of help to catch up to other kids my age so I can one day hope to function independantly in school without needing a teacher's aid and maybe go to university one day!
My Grandma and Grandpa take care of me now and they love me very much, but they don't have much money.  They put me in a montessori school for most of the year, but had to pull me out of school in April because they couldn't afford to keep making the payments to the school. 
My Grandparents would like to put me back in a montessori program in the Fall because this program works specifically on helping me develop the skills that I am delayed in and teaches me structure.  I have a very hard time focussing and sociallizing properly in groups so this environment is very important to develop my social skills too.  Montessori also allows me to learn at my own pace and treats me like the unique person I am.  My Grandparents want to give me the best advantage so that when I get to grade school I will be able to function just like the other kids do in a class and not be on a wait list for a teacher's aid.
Please help me go to a school that can help me develop all my skills.  I am almost 4, but I still can't say or read the whole alphabet or count/read numbers very well.  I still can't draw/copy simple shapes or write any letters either.  I need help with developing my motor skills and with my social development.  I know I can catch up to the other kids, but I just need a lot of extra help and a program that helps me with structure and developing all these skills I need for grade school.  I want to be the same as the other kids my age.
The doctor's are not sure how the exposure to drugs and alcohol in utero will affect me in the long term, so I need all the help I can get while I am little to help me grow strong and smart and do well in school and become an independant, productive member of society when I am all grown up.  These early years are so important to me.  Please help me have the best chance at life, because I am a great kid and every kid deserves a chance to learn and be the best they can be!
 

This is me when I was 2 months old in intesive care at Children's Hospital.

What We Need & What You Get
With your help you will know that you are helping me to get the best start that I can at life.  You give me the gift of early childhood education which will give me the best chance that I could ever have to grow and learn like other kids, to excel into my adulthood, and become a productive member of society who will help lead the way into the future alongside my peers, and to one day nuture my own children the best that I possibly can.  I already have the love and stability of my family.  All I need now is some help with my education during the most important learning years of my life!
 

$4500 Second preschool year tuition in Montesorri Program ($450 x 10 Months)
$200 Registration Fee
$200 School Uniform and Clothing for the year
$45 School Supplies
What Happens if Funds Fall Short or Exceed the Goal? 
If funding falls short it will be determined if there is enough to still send Evelynne to preschool even if it is just regular preschool.  It will depend on how much is raised to determine if it is enough to still send her to montessori, and if not if there is enough to send her to regular preschool.
If funds exceed the goal, funding will be put into drama classes for Evelynne as she has always been very animated, using all kinds of gestures, facial expressions, different tones to her voice, etc, since infancy.  She has a magnetic personality that captures people's attention and she has expressed an interest in taking drama.
If only a very small amount of money is raised and it isn't enough to commit to preschool, then those funds will be put towards some kind of creative classes for Evelynne at the community centre.  Could be dance, music or drama; whatever is offered at the time. 
 
The Impact

This is me in my last school.  I am very small compared to other kids my age.
You can't help me grow in size, but you can help me reach other developmental milestones!
 

The first 5 years of my life are the most crucial years of my development which will affect my ability to learn through grade school, will affect my physical health throughout life and impact my presence in community both socially and economically in future.

""Early gains in school readiness due to early childhood education have been shown to have enormous positive economic and social impacts lasting well into adulthood, from higher educational attainment and less chance of involvement in criminal activity, to higher status employment and higher earnings (Schweinhart 2007; Sparling, Ramey and Ramey 2007.... Heckman concludes, ""We cannot afford to postpone investing in children until they become adults, nor can we wait until they reach school age—a time when it may be too late to intervene. Learning is a dynamic process and is most effective when it begins at a young age and continues through to adulthood."" (Heckman 2000, pg. 50)
""While no single curriculum or pedagogical approach can be identified as best, children who attend well-planned, high-quality ECE programs in which the curriculum aims are specified and integrated across domains tend to learn more and are better prepared to master the complex demands of formal schooling."" (Bowman, Donovan and Burns 2001, p. 7-8)

Why Montesorri?
""Dr. Maria Montessori was a doctor who worked with developmentally delayed children in Rome. She discovered that if she observed children she could discover much about what they needed in order to learn and flourish. Montessori was one of the first people to see the importance of observing children in order to plan an appropriate environment and curriculum to meet their needs....
Dr. Montessori identified four “planes of development,” with each stage having its own developmental characteristics and developmental challenges. The Early Childhood Montessori environment for children age three to six is designed to work with the “absorbent mind,” “sensitive periods,” and the tendencies of children at this stage of their development.
Learning that takes place during these years comes spontaneously without effort, leading children to enter the elementary classes with a clear, concrete sense of many abstract concepts. Montessori helps children to become self-motivated, self-disciplined, and to retain the sense of curiosity that so many children lose along the way in traditional classrooms. They tend to act with care and respect toward their environment and each other. They are able to work at their own pace and ability. The three-year Montessori experience tends to nurture a joy of learning that prepares them for further challenges.""

</div></div>","About Me
My name is Leah Yared and I'm a high school sophomore in Rockville, Maryland. This summer, I will be going on a service trip to Zambia as a part of LearnServe International, a program that connects teenagers to the world.
Zambia is one of the poorest countries in the world. The average annual income is just $395. Zambia is also terribly affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis; 98,000 Zambians have died and 710,000 children are orphans - more than half of whom are HIV positive.
 
What I'll Be Doing
Our LearnServe Zambia team will focus on the HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa. We will work with:
 

Chikumbuso Women and Orphans Project

                           

World Bicycle Relief, building and bringing bicycles to health workers serving HIV/AIDS patients in rural Zambia

                 
 


Africa Directions, a youth-led group using drumming and dance as a medium to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS





Malambo Basic School, a rural school with limited resources but a desire to raise its children from poverty to independence


              
In addition, I will be bringing two 50 pound bags to Zambia that must be filled to the brim with donations. As a group, we will raise $5000 to cover direct project costs (like bike-building), so each participant must raise $250. If I raise at least $500, I will have enough money to cover the fundraising expectation and to buy needed items.
 


What We Need
Financial Fundraising Challenge
All donations will go to the following organizations:


Chikumbuso Community Center- Educates and supports orphaned and vulnerable children. Individual Goal: $25. Group Goal: $500.




Malambo Basic School- Educates rural children living at a farm school. Individual Goal: $30. Group Goal: $600.


Africa Directions- Provides a safe haven for urban youth through drama and cultural activities. Individual Goal: $30. Group Goal: $600.




Chitukuko School- Educates and supports orphaned and vulnerable children. Individual Goal: $30. Group Goal: $600.



World Bicycle Relief- Provides bicycles to teachers and students who live more than 3 miles away from school. Bicycles provide access to healthcare, education, and economic development. They empower people, their families, and their communities. Cost and Individual Goal: $135 per bicycle. Group Goal: $2700.


---> The total amount I need to raise to donate to these specific projects is $250.
 
Material Fundraising Challenge
I also hope to raise money to pay for materials I'll pack with me in my 50 pound donations bag. With at least $250, I'll be able to buy most of the materials on this list. The more I raise, the more supplies can get sent over!
The Chikumbuso Community Center sponsors over 75 orphaned and volunerable children, costing about $450 per child per year. To support the orphans and the school, the following items are needed:



Toothbrushes
Toothpaste
Children's underwear/socks
Soap
Washcloths
Pencils (more expensive than pens!)
Erasers
Children's Vitamins
Backpacks (for children traveling to school)



The Malambo School, which has 275 students enrolled, is in need of school supplies to provide their students with the resources to succeed.



Scissors
Tape
Markers
Pen
Pencils
Pencil Sharpeners
Notebooks
Story Books
Art Supplies (crayons, paint kits, colored paper)



 


   The Impact
Any donation we receive will make a tremendous impact on the life of a Zambian child.

Your donation will supply a child with a bicycle to get to school, saving him/her from walking miles every morning.
Your donation will provide classrooms with necessary school supplies, equipping teachers with the resources to educate the next generation of Zambians.
Your donation will provide a Zambian families with basic necessities that we take for granted here in the U.S., like toiletries and toothbrushes.

Helium Tank / Gas Rental

Balloon Flight Theory

A payload (an insulated box containing some electronics such as a GPS and a radio to allow you to follow progress) is attached to a balloon which is filled with helium (He).
The balloon is released and, as He is lighter than air, the balloon rises and pulls the payload with it.
As the balloon rises the outside pressure decreases which leads to the helium inside the balloon expanding (imagine like its expanding to fill the gap as the outside pressure decreases), this causes the balloon to stretch.
The balloon is made of a form of latex and is incredibly stretchy however it gets to a point where it can't stretch any more and bursts.
Now that there isn't any upward pull from the balloon the payload begins to fall to earth pulled by gravity, as it falls the parachute opens up slowing its descent and it gently glides down to earth.
Throughout the flight the GPS unit inside the payload container is transmitting its position to the internet, where it is viewed by the ground team and tracked.
Additional components include for example cameras and temperature sensor. You also will need a parachute, a balloon and some helium and permission to launch.

<p>I started this page because I so strongly believe in helping Louis – he is a great guy who has helped me a lot, very generously over the past year.  It is just so amazing to me that he just lives down the street and is running with me and coaching me for free..  He has become a friend.  20 years my junior, but still.  I want to give back.  I am inspired by the determination he has to get to the Olympics.  </p>
<p>It started when he was 5years old: Louis ran 1 mile  to school, and back, on his first day.  He was #1 in the US for 800m (1/2 mile) in high school.  In college, he was NCAA Conference Champion in 10K Cross Country.  He was top ranked US Sprint distance triathlete in 2011, competed in Beijing at International Finals and was 7<sup>th</sup> in world in his age group . Now he moves to the next level as he moves to Colorado in May to  take his training hard core.</p>
<p>He works 2 jobs.  Trains extensively. And has a dream that is reachable. His family is totally behind him, letting him live at home.  He has a coach that has coached others to be Olympic Triathletes.  He’s got everything.  He could just use some help financing the many things he needs to keep moving forward.   </p>
<p>I have most of this info on thid fundraiser page, as well as a video in the gallery section of a short 2 minute interview I did of him where he talks about WHY he wants to be in the Olympics</p>

<p>Rays of Grace believes in a life that is
filled with loads of joy, tangible love, meaningful relationships and meeting
people where they are.  For the past four years, this love has taken us
thousands of miles across the ocean and deep into the jungle to a little place
called Kirugu, Uganda.  We spent time immersing ourselves into a culture
and a way of life that was and is nothing short of beautiful.  It was no
longer ""us"" and ""them"", but rather, ""we are all family"".
 </p>
<p>Rays of Grace spent time listening to
our community in Kirugu, asking them what they need rather than telling them
what we have to offer them.  Time and again, we heard a resounding answer:
education.  When given the proper tools, the feelings of empowerment and
self-worth sets a fire in the human soul.  With incredible teamwork and a
united front of Ugandans and Americans, we began to dream big dreams and pray
HUGE prayers, knowing that we could not do this alone.</p>
<p>Our brave and courageous Ugandan
Founder, Muwuliza Jackson, established Mountain of Olives Nursery and Primary
school and so graciously allowed Rays of Grace to partner with him in the
sustainable development of the community of Kirugu through education.  </p>
<p>Mountain of Olives now serves a
little under 500 children and their families.  The future holds hope and
excitement as we plan for a new school structure, agriculture projects, clean
water projects and micro finance businesses.  </p>
<p>As we focus on developing the
grounds of our new school, Jackson grins from ear to ear at the thought of a
proper playground and soccer field.  To bless not only our immediate
students, but the community as well with an area to get out and be active, will
bring endless amounts of fun, games and a space for the community to gather.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining the journey,
you are impacting so many beautiful souls an ocean away!        </p>

</h3> <p>Thanks for clicking on the Proudli  campaign! </p>
<p>Proudli is a social commerce app, designed to unify commerce of the global African diaspora by facilitating multiple internet based black owned  businesses.</p>
<p>  Proudli is  a combination of all the features of Facebook and Amazon. Why not just go to Facebook or Amazon you say? Well sparky,commerce only makes up 2% of Facebook's revenue because users do not go to Facebook for business and black consumers have been scratching their heads as to how and where to spend their 1.3 Trillion dollars USD with black owned businesses. Proudli is US patent pending and is  available in the Apple store and on Google Play to serve this need.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>ABOUT THE DEVELOPER</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Renae Bruce-Miller, the Developer of the Proudli App. </p>
<p>I first learned to invest in tech stocks when I was 21 years old and spent a great deal of time watching and learning the evolution of the internet developments. While waiting on the sidelines, I worked for top fortune 500 Companies in the United States for several years and became passionate about entrepreneurism, business development and business consulting. In the meantime, I learned from other startup failures and successes and business models, before entering the internet space. I developed 6 predecessors to Proudli, before I got it right and entered the social commerce space at its emergence to benefit from future projection and exponential growth of this business model.</p>

Blacks also do not own and control their own media and are challenged in being able to afford advertising on main stream media to reach their consumers. Proudli addresses this need as well through low cost affordable but powerful advertising.</span><br/></p>

<p>I have worked really hard over the past year to develop this project and have received a lot of media exposure but Proudli needs consistent advertising in certain markets to build a steady stream of users. </p>
<p>This campaign is designed to raise funds for advertising, hiring a web master  and  to assist me  as the work is far beyond the grasp of one girl and her HP laptop.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Contributors will help me to achieve growth and development of not only my business, but other black owned businesses across the world to reach new customers and make an impact in their lives and communities. </span></p> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What Proudli Needs &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>Proudli needs approximately 250,000 USD that will go towards advertising in the United States, the Caribbean, Canada and the United Kingdom as well as web development and hiring tech assistants to expand the project.  </li> <li>If I do not reach my entire campaign goal, depending on how much is raised the funds will be used for site improvement, technical developments, maintenance  advertising and to send you a snazzy thank you gift. (who says snazzy anyway? lol)</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Our Impact</h3>

</div>
<p>WE  are a part of the equation, you see the poor black communities and the failure of black owned businesses with your own eyes. </p>
<p>You see the correlation between poor economic power and political power. You see black owned businesses struggling, failing and folding right along with their communities as our money is leaked into the hands of others who are not interested in funding our private schools or building our businesses. </p>
<p> I have done all that  I could do within my power and now I need your help.</p>
<p>There is a place for black owned businesses, a place to dream, to try and to succeed. That place is called Proudli.</p> <ul> <li> Now is the time to act, social commerce for the global African diaspora to practice group economics is the way in which black owned businesses from around the world will built relationships and find new customers.</li>
<li>Black Consumers are the largest online shoppers but very little is being spent with black owned businesses.</li>
<li> Your contributions are a part of a movement that is sorely needed to build our communities I have come a long way by myself but I need your help. </li>
<li>This project is more than my company, this project is about every black owned company in the world and the future of our children. </li> </ul>

<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As the sole developer/Owner/CEO and head dreamer of this project, I have  faced many challenges and I understand that there are future challenges to come but I have the foresight, experience, grit and the tenacity to stay the course and captain the ship through whatever the storm. I am not a quitter and it is proven through these events below.</p> <ul> <li>I believe the hardest part about this project is behind me because this project is an idea that has been circling in my head since 2005 and it took a brain tumor to bring me to my senses in 2013 to actually bring it to life. <span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">I was so afraid of dying with my gifts, that I used this project to get myself better. I have overcome many physical and personal challenges to see this business realized and will continue to make necessary sacrifices in the future.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""> I have invested everything I own and sold all my furniture and my car on Craigslist and presently living on the charity of friends in Jamaica where I moved to Jamaica to heal myself.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">I currently  work pro bono  at a radio station producing and hosting a high value content show about entrepreneurism to spread the word about Proudli. I have been hungry, exhausted and emotionally drained but this idea is much bigger than I am and I refuse to let it die. In fact it is no longer an idea but a right to exist.</span></li>
<li>On December 02, 2014-Proudli was  selected by Oasis500,one of the top tech funding accelerators in the world located in Amman Jordan to receive investments and mentorship, but I  was unable to make the trip because I couldn't afford the airfare.<span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""> It was  very disheartening,devastating  and demoralizing to know that only a few thousand dollars came between so much hard work and the opportunity to grow this company, but I am a fighter and decided to take the fact that Proudli beat out other tech start ups for such a coveted spot as a sign of encouragement and not defeat. Being selected by Oasis500  proves to me that Proudli is ready by all measures and all I need is a little financial assistance. I will use your funds to fight for this company,grow this company, hire people and develop it no matter what happens because the future of black business development depends on it. </span>

 Thanks for clicking on the Proudli  campaign! 
Proudli is a social commerce app, designed to unify commerce of the global African diaspora by facilitating multiple internet based black owned  businesses.
  Proudli is  a combination of all the features of Facebook and Amazon. Why not just go to Facebook or Amazon you say? Well sparky,commerce only makes up 2% of Facebook's revenue because users do not go to Facebook for business and black consumers have been scratching their heads as to how and where to spend their 1.3 Trillion dollars USD with black owned businesses. Proudli is US patent pending and is  available in the Apple store and on Google Play to serve this need.
ABOUT PROUDLI



ABOUT THE DEVELOPER

My name is Renae Bruce-Miller, the Developer of the Proudli App. 
I first learned to invest in tech stocks when I was 21 years old and spent a great deal of time watching and learning the evolution of the internet developments. While waiting on the sidelines, I worked for top fortune 500 Companies in the United States for several years and became passionate about entrepreneurism, business development and business consulting. In the meantime, I learned from other startup failures and successes and business models, before entering the internet space. I developed 6 predecessors to Proudli, before I got it right and entered the social commerce space at its emergence to benefit from future projection and exponential growth of this business model.

WHY BLACK BUSINESSES FAIL 



THE NEED FOR PROUDLI



Black owned businesses are failing globally as they are dispersed far and wide in the United States Great Britain and Canada and in the Caribbean they are struggling with imported goods instead of locally manufactured goods.  Proudli solves this problem by bringing together the powerful tools of Social Networking and Online Commerce. Blacks also do not own and control their own media and are challenged in being able to afford advertising on main stream media to reach their consumers. Proudli addresses this need as well through low cost affordable but powerful advertising.



THIS CAMPAIGN
I have worked really hard over the past year to develop this project and have received a lot of media exposure but Proudli needs consistent advertising in certain markets to build a steady stream of users. 
This campaign is designed to raise funds for advertising, hiring a web master  and  to assist me  as the work is far beyond the grasp of one girl and her HP laptop.
Contributors will help me to achieve growth and development of not only my business, but other black owned businesses across the world to reach new customers and make an impact in their lives and communities.     What Proudli Needs & What You Get 
Proudli needs approximately 250,000 USD that will go towards advertising in the United States, the Caribbean, Canada and the United Kingdom as well as web development and hiring tech assistants to expand the project.   If I do not reach my entire campaign goal, depending on how much is raised the funds will be used for site improvement, technical developments, maintenance  advertising and to send you a snazzy thank you gift. (who says snazzy anyway? lol)    Our Impact


The difference between the current global failure of black owned businesses and the successful growth of opportunities for black business owners and strong community development is US. 

WE  are a part of the equation, you see the poor black communities and the failure of black owned businesses with your own eyes. 
You see the correlation between poor economic power and political power. You see black owned businesses struggling, failing and folding right along with their communities as our money is leaked into the hands of others who are not interested in funding our private schools or building our businesses. 
 I have done all that  I could do within my power and now I need your help.
There is a place for black owned businesses, a place to dream, to try and to succeed. That place is called Proudli.   Now is the time to act, social commerce for the global African diaspora to practice group economics is the way in which black owned businesses from around the world will built relationships and find new customers.
Black Consumers are the largest online shoppers but very little is being spent with black owned businesses.
 Your contributions are a part of a movement that is sorely needed to build our communities I have come a long way by myself but I need your help. 
This project is more than my company, this project is about every black owned company in the world and the future of our children.  



   Risks & Challenges As the sole developer/Owner/CEO and head dreamer of this project, I have  faced many challenges and I understand that there are future challenges to come but I have the foresight, experience, grit and the tenacity to stay the course and captain the ship through whatever the storm. I am not a quitter and it is proven through these events below.  I believe the hardest part about this project is behind me because this project is an idea that has been circling in my head since 2005 and it took a brain tumor to bring me to my senses in 2013 to actually bring it to life. I was so afraid of dying with my gifts, that I used this project to get myself better. I have overcome many physical and personal challenges to see this business realized and will continue to make necessary sacrifices in the future.

 I have invested everything I own and sold all my furniture and my car on Craigslist and presently living on the charity of friends in Jamaica where I moved to Jamaica to heal myself.
I currently  work pro bono  at a radio station producing and hosting a high value content show about entrepreneurism to spread the word about Proudli. I have been hungry, exhausted and emotionally drained but this idea is much bigger than I am and I refuse to let it die. In fact it is no longer an idea but a right to exist.
On December 02, 2014-Proudli was  selected by Oasis500,one of the top tech funding accelerators in the world located in Amman Jordan to receive investments and mentorship, but I  was unable to make the trip because I couldn't afford the airfare. It was  very disheartening,devastating  and demoralizing to know that only a few thousand dollars came between so much hard work and the opportunity to grow this company, but I am a fighter and decided to take the fact that Proudli beat out other tech start ups for such a coveted spot as a sign of encouragement and not defeat. Being selected by Oasis500  proves to me that Proudli is ready by all measures and all I need is a little financial assistance. I will use your funds to fight for this company,grow this company, hire people and develop it no matter what happens because the future of black business development depends on it.

We will <strong>walk</strong> 1,500 km on medieval pilgrimage routes and collect material which we will then share<strong> with you</strong>. We will prepare online courses, 12 short films, a collective monograph, dozens of lectures accessible online, wonderful photographs and more.</p><p>This project joins in students and professors from universities in France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, the USA and the Czech Republic. They want to <strong>open the question</strong> of arts and pilgrimage in the Middle Ages <strong>to the general public</strong>. Our aim is also to change the way the university is perceived. It should no longer be an exclusively theoretical institution, but should become an actual experience. The project is a <strong>unique experiment</strong> that could <strong>change the history of art</strong>.</p><p>To achieve it, we need your support.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477999017/utaaqw7xeipn2elp3xhh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Migrating Art Historians is a <strong>unique project </strong>based on our aim to study artworks through the physical experience of a body.</p><p>We will leave the classrooms of the university to walk for the entire semester, in order to <strong>approach artworks personally</strong> and <strong>study them in their natural environment</strong>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477999111/kggy2yksb3z62hshgkuz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Among our <strong>biggest supporters</strong> are, in addition to <strong>Hans Belting</strong>, Balzan prize winner, such authorities as <strong>Bissera Pentcheva</strong> from Stanford University and <strong>Herbert L.

Moreover, the University has also approved a <strong>special study plan for the students</strong> taking part in the project.

Following the <strong>example of medieval pilgrims</strong>, we will <strong>travel on foot</strong>. After weeks of walking, sleeping without shelter and without the help of most modern conveniences, we will be tired and will have to overcome physical obstacles and pain. By renouncing modern means of transport, we will experience a <strong>slowing of time</strong>.</p><p>All of <strong>this will change our perception</strong> of the artworks.</p><p>That said, we are absolutely aware that we cannot re-live the medieval person’s experience and feelings. On the other hand, we do believe it is possible, in many aspects, to <strong>get closer to the pre-modern reception</strong> of the art works. In modern times, we are used to looking at the objects quickly and from a close perspective. The pilgrimage, following <strong>the rhythm of human pace, offers a new point of view</strong>, as we already experienced during our summer walks in the last five years.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477999398/w5tjorxzrkshpakei7om.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Thus <i>Migrating Art Historians</i> presents an <strong>innovative approach to education</strong>.

  Experimental International Project “Migrating Art Historians”  The project Migrating Art Historians proposes a new look on the Middle Ages. We will walk 1,500 km on medieval pilgrimage routes and collect material which we will then share with you. We will prepare online courses, 12 short films, a collective monograph, dozens of lectures accessible online, wonderful photographs and more.This project joins in students and professors from universities in France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, the USA and the Czech Republic. They want to open the question of arts and pilgrimage in the Middle Ages to the general public. Our aim is also to change the way the university is perceived. It should no longer be an exclusively theoretical institution, but should become an actual experience. The project is a unique experiment that could change the history of art.To achieve it, we need your support.Migrating Art Historians is a unique project based on our aim to study artworks through the physical experience of a body.We will leave the classrooms of the university to walk for the entire semester, in order to approach artworks personally and study them in their natural environment.Among our biggest supporters are, in addition to Hans Belting, Balzan prize winner, such authorities as Bissera Pentcheva from Stanford University and Herbert L. Kessler from Johns Hopkins University.Institutionally, we are supported by Masaryk University, which covers this project and partially supports us financially. Moreover, the University has also approved a special study plan for the students taking part in the project. Yet, there are still other important supporters - the cloisters, which have agreed to host us and allow us to study and rest within their facilities.This project will also include the participation of scholars such as Michele Bacci from the University of Fribourg; Stefano D'Ovidio, Bibliotheca Hertziana, Max-Planck-Institut für Kunstgeschichte; Daniela Mondini, Università della Svizzera italiana; Éric Palazzo from the University of Poitiers.This project is experimental and exceptional in many aspects. Following the example of medieval pilgrims, we will travel on foot. After weeks of walking, sleeping without shelter and without the help of most modern conveniences, we will be tired and will have to overcome physical obstacles and pain. By renouncing modern means of transport, we will experience a slowing of time.All of this will change our perception of the artworks.That said, we are absolutely aware that we cannot re-live the medieval person’s experience and feelings. On the other hand, we do believe it is possible, in many aspects, to get closer to the pre-modern reception of the art works. In modern times, we are used to looking at the objects quickly and from a close perspective. The pilgrimage, following the rhythm of human pace, offers a new point of view, as we already experienced during our summer walks in the last five years.Thus Migrating Art Historians presents an innovative approach to education. After theoretical preparation, students will study the objects personally in situ with all the above-mentioned aspects. Their task will be to present their results not only within the frame of the university program but also to communicate them to the general public. Although experimental and innovative, the project Migrating Art Historians is grounded on already acquired experiences. It has risen from observations collected on French and Italian medieval pilgrimage routes during the past five years. These five summer walks have completely changed our point of view on medieval objects. That is why a group of twelve art historians decided to broaden their experience as well as to put it into a specific scientific framework and – with the help of modern technology – to transmit it to a wider audience. That is why we need you!We have invited specialists to give courses and write contributions to the final monograph. We will ourselves write about the artworks we encounter. Our team includes graphic designers experienced in producing books as well as filmmakers, well-trained in the preparation of study materials, working for the e-learning platform of Masaryk University. We need enthusiastic supporters.We want to share this whole experience with you. To open the seemingly closed field of art history. We want to transmit our experience to the general public.For this reason, we need funding.  With the amount of €6.300 that the Department of Art History of Masaryk University in Brno has given to the project, the costs involved for the organization of the lectures in the cloisters are partially covered. From private sponsors, we have already collected €3.000 for the same purpose.  To to be able to transmit the results of our journey to you, we need your help to cover the expenses connected to filming and postproduction. That amount, including technical equipment, is estimated at 15 965. The production of our second output – final monograph gathering information on the artworks studied – is estimated at 6000Despite the fact that we will live in a low-cost way, some support to pay living costs during the walk will be necessary. The estimation of living costs has been pushed to its lowest level possible, being €7/day/person, for a total of €10.080.Some of our students are already earning a living. For this reason, we need to support their basic necessities during the walk since they are interrupting their employment activity to dedicate themselves entirely to the project.Since we have already undertaken five walking pilgrimages during the past years, we do not need to buy the basic equipment. However, this time we will start at the end of winter, and for this reason we will need to complete our gear. The estimated expenses per person are €550 – an amount that is difficult to raise for some students.   We would be very grateful if you decide to support us.If you like our project but can not support us financially, please pass this message along to any person who might be interested. The Itinerary From Lausanne to Mont-Saint-Michel, we will travel 1,500 kilometers on foot in 4 months (from 1st March to the end of June), following and crossing three main medieval pilgrimage roads (Via Turonensis, Via Lemovicensis, Via Podiensis).We will go through the cities where important monuments, subjects of our research are located, such as Geneva, Lyon, Conques, Nevers, Fleury, Tours and Rennes. We will walk three weeks, which will be followed by three-week breaks spent within the monasteries (Conques, Saint Benoît sur Loire, Mont Saint Michel).These are the places, where significant scholars in our field will meet us. Through a series of lectures and discussions, these scholars will help us to move forward in our research resulting in our master theses as well as in the final monograph. These are also places from where we will prepare movies for you, and from where we will stream the lectures online, on the Masaryk University e-learning platform. More About UsMost of the participants of the project belong to the Center for Early Medieval Studies at Masaryk University in Brno (CZ), founded in 2012 by Ivan Foletti. The project is one of the Center's many activities.Since its foundation, the Center has organized many international conferences, invited the most significant scholars of the field, founded the prestigious international journal Convivium and published several books. With its regular lectures entitled StredoveC JinaX, the Center also seeks contact with a non-academic audience.These activities of the Center have attracted attention of one of the most important living art historians, Hans Belting, who, together with Christa Belting-Ihm, donated their collection of literature on medieval art to the Center. With the quality of the collection acquired, the Center has risen to the level of the best European institutions.Other members of the project responsible for filmmaking and technical support are based at the E-learning Office, Faculty of Arts, Masaryk University.If you want to learn more about the participants see our web site. *** Projet international et expérimental « Historiens de l'art migrateurs » 

 
Le projet « Historiens de l’art migrateur » propose un regard nouveau sur le Moyen Âge. Nous allons marcher 1500 km le long des routes de pèlerinage médiévales et recueillir des expériences que nous allons partager avec vous. Nous allons préparer des cours online pour vous, 12 court-métrages, une monographie collective, des dizaines de conférences accessibles online, des photos merveilleuses et bien plus encore.Au sein du projet des étudiants avec des professeurs d’universités de France, d’Italie, d’Allemagne, de Suisse, des Etats-Unis et de la République tchèque vont participer. Ils souhaitent ouvrir la question des arts et du pèlerinage au Moyen Âge au grand public.Notre but est de changer la manière dont l’université est perçue. Elle ne doit plus être simplement une institution théorique, mais devenir une véritable expérimentation. Le projet est une expérience unique qui pourrait changer l’histoire de l’art.Pour le réaliser nous avons besoin de votre aide.« Historiens de l’art migrateurs » est un projet unique, basé sur notre but d’étudier les œuvres d’art à travers l’expérience physique de notre corps.Nous allons quitter les salles de cours de notre université pour marcher pendant tout un semestre, afin d’approcher les œuvres d’art personnellement et de les étudier dans leur contexte naturel.Parmi nos grands supporteurs il y a, en dehors de Hans Belting, gagnant du prix Balzan ; des autorités telles que Bissera Pentcheva de l’université de Stanford ; Herbert L. Kessler de l’université John Hopkins.Nous sommes soutenus par l’université Masaryk de Brno, qui couvre ce projet et nous supporte en partie financièrement. De plus, l’université a approuvé d’un plan d’étude spécial pour les étudiants qui participeront à ce projet.Mais il y a aussi nos autres supporteurs importants – les monastères, qui ont accepté de nous accueillir et de nous permettre d’étudier et de nous reposer dans leurs complexes.À ce projet vont participer également des chercheurs tels que Michele Bacci de l’université de Fribourg ; Stefano D’Ovidio, Bibliotheca Hertziana, Max-Planck-Institut für Kunstgeschichte ; Daniela Mondini, Università della Svizzera italiana ; Éric Palazzo de l’université de Poitiers.Ce projet est expérimental et exceptionnel par bien des aspects.Suivant l’exemple des pèlerins médiévaux, nous allons voyager à pied. Après des semaines de marche, à dormir sans abri et sans l’aide des commodités modernes, nous seront fatigués et auront à surmonter les obstacles physiques et la douleur. En renonçant aux moyens de transport modernes, nous vivrons le ralentissement du temps. Tout cela modifiera notre perception des œuvres d’art.Bien sûr, nous sommes parfaitement conscients que nous ne pouvons pas revivre les expériences et sentiments d’une personne vivant au Moyen Âge. D’un autre côté, nous pensons qu’il est possible – à travers différents aspects – de se rapprocher de la réception pré-moderne des œuvres d’art. De nos jours, nous sommes habitués à voir les objets rapidement et d’une perspective rapprochée. Le pèlerinage au rythme naturel des pas offre un point de vue nouveau, comme nous l’avons déjà remarqué durant nos marches d’été que nous avons effectuées durant les cinq dernières années.« Historiens de l’art migrateurs » représente une approche innovatrice des études. Après une préparation théorique, les étudiants vont étudier les objets personnellement in situ, à travers tous les aspects précédemment mentionnés. Leur tâche sera de présenter leurs résultats non seulement au sein du cadre universitaire habituel, mais également au grand public.Bien qu’expérimental et innovant, le projet « Historiens de l’art migrateurs » est basé sur des expériences déjà acquises. Il est issu de nos observations recueillies sur les routes de pèlerinage françaises et italiennes durant les cinq dernières années. Ces cinq marches estivales ont complètement modifié notre point de vue sur les objets médiévaux. C’est pourquoi un groupe de douze historiens de l’art a décidé d’élargir l’expérience tout en la contextualisant au sein d’un cadre scientifique spécifique et, à l’aide de technologies modernes, de la transmettre au grand public. C’est pour cela que nous avons besoin de vous !Nous avons invité des spécialistes pour donner des cours et écrire des articles au sein de la monographie conclusive. Nous allons nous-mêmes écrire au sujet des œuvres d’art que nous allons rencontrer au long du chemin. Notre équipe est composée de graphistes habitués à produire des ouvrages, de même que de réalisateurs qui travaillent pour la plateforme e-learning de l’université Masaryk de Brno, habitués à préparer du matériel d’enseignement. Nous avons besoin de supporteurs enthousiastes.Nous voulons intégralement partager cette expérience avec vous. Afin d’ouvrir le champ apparemment fermé de l’histoire de l’art, nous voulons transmettre nos expériences au grand public.C’est pour cette raison que nous avons besoin de financement.  Avec la somme de 6300€ que le département d’histoire de l’art de l’université de Brno offre au projet, nous pouvons partiellement couvrir les coûts de l’organisation des conférences dans les monastères. De la part de sponsors privés, nous avons obtenu 3000€ dans le même but.Afin de pouvoir vous transmettre les résultats de notre voyage, nous avons besoin de votre aide pour couvrir les dépenses liées au tournage et à la post-production. La somme, en incluant les équipements techniques, est estimée à 15 965 €.  La production du second résultat, la monographie finale, est estimée à 6000€.Malgré le fait nous allons vivre avec des frais limités, nous allons avoir besoin d’un petit soutien pour vivre durant la marche. L’estimation du coût de la vie minimal est de 7€/jour/personne, pour un total de 10 080€.Certains de nos étudiants gagnent leur vie. Pour cette raison, nous avons besoin de couvrir leurs nécessités durant la marche puisqu’ils vont interrompre leur activité professionnelle entièrement pour se consacrer entièrement au projet.Puisque nous avons déjà entrepris des marches cinq fois durant les dernières années, nous n’avons pas besoin d’acheter l’équipement de base. En revanche, cette fois nous allons commencer la marche à la fin de l’hiver, et pour cette raison nous aurons besoin de compléter notre équipement. Les coûts estimés par personne sont de 550€, une somme difficile à réunir pour certains étudiants. Nous vous serions très reconnaissant si vous décidez de nous soutenir. Si vous aimez le projet mais que vous ne pouvez pas nous soutenir financièrement, nous voudrions vous demander de faire passer le message à toute personne qui pourrait être intéressée. L’itinéraire De Lausanne au Mont-Saint-Michel, nous allons parcourir 1500 kilomètres à pied en quatre mois (du premier mars à la fin de juin), en suivant et en croisant trois des principales routes de pèlerinage médiévales (Via Turonensis, Via Lemovicensis, Via Podiensis).Nous allons traverser les villes où se trouvent les monuments importants, sujets de notre étude, telles que Genève, Lyon, Conques, Nevers, Fleury, Tours et Rennes. Nous allons marcher trois semaines, qui seront suivies de pauses de trois semaines au sein des monastères (Conques, Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire, Mont-Saint-Michel).C’est à ces endroits que d’importants chercheurs de la discipline vont nous rejoindre. À travers une série de conférences et de discussions, ces chercheurs vont nous aider à avancer dans nos recherches, qui résulteront en des mémoires de master ainsi qu’en une monographie finale. C’est également à ces endroits que nous allons préparer les films pour vous, et d’où nous allons diffuser en live online les conférences grâce à la plateforme e-learning de l’université Masaryk. Plus à notre sujetLa plupart des étudiants font partie du Center for Early Medieval Studies (Centre d’études sur le Haut Moyen Âge) de l’Université Masaryk de Brno (CZ), fondé en 2012 par Ivan Foletti. Le projet est l’une des nombreuses activités du centre.Depuis sa fondation, le centre a organisé de nombreuses conférences internationales, invité les chercheurs les plus importants du domaine, fondé le prestigieux périodique international Convivium, et publié plusieurs ouvrages. À travers ses conférences régulières StredoveC JinaX, le centre cherche aussi le contact avec un public non-académique.Ces activités ont attiré l’attention de l’un des plus importants historiens de l’art, Hans Belting, qui, avec Christa Belting-Ihm, ont offert en don leur collection de livres au sujet de l’art médiéval au centre. Grâce à la qualité de la collection acquise, le centre se hisse au niveau des meilleures institutions européennes.D’autre membre du projet, responsables de la réalisation et du support technologique, sont membres du team e-learning de la Faculté des Lettres de l’université Masaryk de Brno.Si vous voulez en savoir plus sur les participants, visitez notre site web. *** Experimentální mezinárodní projekt “Migrating Art Historians” 

 
Projekt Stěhovaví historici umění otevírá nový pohled na středověk. Budeme putovat 1500 km pěšky po poutnických cestách a sbírat materiál, o který bychom se s vámi chtěli podělit. Připravíme pro vás online přednášky, 12 krátkých filmů, kolektivní monografii, desítku kurzů, kvalitní fotografie a mnohem více.Projektu se zúčastní studenti a profesoři z univerzit ve Francii, Itálii, Německu, Švýcarsku, USA a České republice. Naším cílem je otevřít širokému publiku téma umění a středověkého poutnictví. Chceme ale také přinést nový prvek do univerzitního vzdělávání – univerzita ne pouze jako místo přijímaní teoretických informací, ale jako přímo prožitá zkušenost. Jedná se o jedinečný experiment, který může změnit dějiny umění.Abychom tento projekt mohli uskutečnit, potřebujeme Vaši pomoc.Stěhovaví historici umění je jedinečný projekt, který se zaměřuje na studium uměleckých děl skrze fyzickou zkušenost vlastního těla. Opustíme univerzitní učebny a pěšky budeme putovat celý semestr, abychom se přiblížili k uměleckým dílům a studovali je v jejich přirozeném prostředí.Mezi našimi skalními podporovateli jsou Hans Belting, držitel Balzan prize, Herbert L. Kessler z Johns Hopkins University v Baltimoru nebo Bissera Pentcheva z Univerzity ve Stanfordu. Projekt zaštiťuje Masarykova univerzita, která rovněž pokrývá část nákladů. Univerzita také schválila zvláštní studijní plán pro studenty, kteří se pochodu zúčastní. Přízeň nám vyjádřily i kláštery, které nám během našich zastavení poskytnou přístřeší, abychom mohli zpracovávat nasbíraný materiál a také si odpočinout.Na projektu Stěhovavých historiků umění se budou podílet badatelé jako Michele Bacci z univerzity ve Friburgu, Daniela Mondini z univerzity ve švýcarském Luganu, Eric Palazzo z univerzity v Poitiers a další.Projekt je experimentální a výjimečný v mnoha ohledech. Stejně jako středověcí poutníci budeme putovat pěšky. Po týdnech chůze, spaní bez střechy nad hlavou a bez pomoci většiny vymožeností civilizace, budeme unavení a budeme muset překonávat různorodé překážky i bolest. Tím, že se vzdáme moderních dopravních prostředků, zažijeme zpomalení času.Toto všechno změní naše vnímání uměleckých děl. Jsme si samozřejmě vědomi toho, že není možné vrátit se do středověku a zažít pocity člověka jiné epochy. Předpokládáme však, že je možné se v mnoha ohledech přiblížit pre-modernímu vnímání uměleckých děl. V současné době jsme zvyklí dívat se na věci kolem nás rychle a zblízka. Jak jsme ale zjistili během našich pochodů v posledních pěti letech, pouť v rytmu lidské chůze nabízí nový, odlišný pohled na věci kolem nás.Stěhovaví historici umění tedy chtějí přinést inovativní přístup ke vzdělávání. Po teoretické přípravě budou studenti zkoumat středověké objekty in situ se všemi výše zmíněnými aspekty. Jejich úkolem ale nebude představit výsledky jen v rámci univerzitního programu, chtějí je také předat široké veřejnosti.I když je projekt Stěhovaví historici umění experimentální a novátorský, vychází ze zkušeností nasbíraných na francouzských a italských středověkých poutních cestách během posledních pěti let. Pět letních pochodů v letech 2011–2016 zcela změnilo náš pohled na středověké objekty. To je důvod, proč se skupina dvanácti historiků umění rozhodla své zkušenosti prohloubit, dát jim specifický vědecký rámec a s pomocí moderních technologií je zprostředkovat i vám.Pozvali jsme odborníky, kteří povedou přednášky a přispějí svými články do výsledné monografie. Tu zpracují grafici našeho týmu. Filmy připraví skupina z e-learningové platformy Masarykovy univerzity. Potřebujeme však další přátele, příznivce a sponzory, kteří nám pomohou s finančním zajištěním celého projektu.Seminář dějin umění Masarykovy univerzity v Brně, který náš projekt podporuje, částečně pokryje náklady spojené s organizací přednášek odborníků v klášterech částkou 170 000 Kč. Od soukromých sponzorů jsme na stejný účel doposud získali částku 80 000 Kč.Abychom vám ale mohli zprostředkovat výsledky naší práce, potřebujeme finanční pomoc, která by pokryla náklady spojené s produkcí a postprodukcí filmů. Předpokládáme částku 430 000 Kč na technické vybavení. Náklady na realizaci našeho druhého výstupu, tedy monografie studovaných středověkých objektů, odhadujeme na částku 162 000 Kč.I přesto, že během naší pouti budeme žít co nejskromněji, potřebujeme pomoci i s pokrytím nezbytných životních nákladů. Jejich výše je odhadovaná na 190 Kč/os/den, tzn. 272 000 Kč celkem. Vaši podporu k pokrytí těchto nezbytných nákladů potřebujeme i proto, že někteří studenti si na své živobytí vydělávají sami. Během pouti však musí své pracovní aktivity přerušit a zcela se věnovat projektu.Jelikož jsme během posledních let již pětkrát absolvovali pouť, nepotřebujeme nakoupit základní vybavení. Nicméně tentokrát budeme vyrážet na konci zimy a z tohoto důvodu budeme muset naši výbavu doplnit. Předpokládané výlohy za osobu jsou 15 000 Kč (180 000 Kč celkem), což je částka, která je pro některé studenty jen těžko dostupná.Budeme velmi vděční, rozhodnete-li se nás podpořit. Pokud nám nemůžete pomoci finančně, prosíme vás, abyste povědomí o projektu šířili mezi všechny, které by mohl zaujmout. Itinerář 1. března 2017 vyrazíme z Lausanne. Za čtyři měsíce ujdeme 1500 kilometrů po třech důležitých středověkých poutních cestách Via Turonensis, Via Lemovicensis, Via Podiensis. Budeme procházet městy se středověkými památkami, jako je Ženeva, Lyon, Conques, Nevers, Fleury, Tours či Rennes. Budeme putovat ve třech etapách. Vždy po třech týdnech cesty se na další tři týdny zastavíme v klášterech v Conques, Saint Benoît sur Loire a Mont Saint Michel.V klášterech se setkáme s významnými historiky umění, kteří budou přednášet a s nimiž budeme diskutovat. Výsledkem bude několik diplomových prací a finální kolektivní monografie. Kláštery budou také místem, odkud budeme vysílat online přednášky pomocí e-learningové platformy Masarykovy univerzity a kde pro vás budeme připravovat filmy. Více o násVětšina účastníků projektu patří k Centru raně středověkých studií při Masarykově univerzitě v Brně, které bylo založené v roce 2012 Ivanem Folettim. Náš projekt je však jednou z mnoha aktivit Centra.Od svého založení Centrum zorganizovalo několik mezinárodních konferencí,  pozvalo mnoho důležitých specialistů oboru, založilo prestižní mezinárodní periodikum Convivium a publikovalo několik knih. Svými pravidelnými přednáškami v rámci cyklu StředověC JinaX oslovuje i neakademické publikum.Tyto aktivity Centra přitáhly pozornost i jednoho z nejdůležitějších historiků umění Hanse Beltinga, který, společně s Christou Belting-Ihm, daroval Centru sbírku literatury o středověkém umění. Kvalitou sbírky tak Centrum získalo zázemí na úrovni nejlepších evropských institucí.Další členové projektu, kteří budou zodpovědní za realizaci filmů a technickou podporu, pracují v rámci Kanceláře e-learningu na Filozofické fakultě Masarykovy univerzity.Chcete-li se dozvědět více o všech účastnících pochodu, navštivte naše webové stránky. *** Progetto internazionale sperimentale “Storici dell’arte migranti”  Il progetto “Storici dell’arte migranti” propone un nuovo approccio al medioevo. Cammineremo per 1500 km sulle rotte dei pellegrini medievali e raccoglieremo del materiale che condividremo con voi. Prepareremo corsi online per voi, 12 brevi filmati, monografie collettive e tante conferenze disponibili online, meravigliose fotografie e molto di più...A questo progetto prendono parte studenti e docenti provenienti da università della Francia, Italia, Germania, Svizzera, Stati Uniti e Repubblica Ceca. Il nostro intento è quello di aprire il dibattito sulle arti e il pellegrinaggio medievale al più vasto pubblico. Vogliamo inoltre cambiare il modo di percepire l’università. Essa infatti non deve più essere solo un’istituzione che offre solo teoria. Deve invece diventare un’esperienza pratica. Il progetto vuole essere dunque un esperimento unico che potrebbe riuscire a cambiare la storia dell’arte.Per realizzarlo abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto.“Storici dell’arte migranti” è un progetto unico che coincide con la nostra ambizione di studiare le opera d’arte attraverso l’esperienza fisica del nostro corpo. Lasceremo le aule universitarie per camminare per un intero semestre in modo da approcciare l’opera d’arte di persona e da studiarla nel suo contesto naturale.Tra i nostri maggiori sostenitori vantiamo, oltre a Hans Belting (premio Balzan), autorevoli figure quali Bissera Pentcheva della Stanford University, Herbert L. Kessler della Johns Hopkins University. Istituzionalmente, siamo sostenuti dalla Masaryk University, la quale copre il progetto e ci finanzia in parte. La Masaryk University ha inoltre approvato un piano di studi speciale per gli studenti che prenderanno parte al progetto. Abbiamo anche degli importanti supporter esterni: i monasteri, che hanno accettato di ospitarci e di permetterci di studiare presso di loro beneficiando delle risorse messe da loro a disposizione. Al nostro progetto parteciperanno prestigiosi studiosi quale Michele Bacci dell’Università di Friburgo; Stefano D'Ovidio, (Bibliotheca Hertziana, Max-Planck-Institut für Kunstgeschichte, Rom), Daniela Mondini (Università della della Svizzera italiana), Eric Palazzo dell’Università di Poitiers.Il progetto è sperimentale ed eccezionale per molti aspetti. Seguendo l’esempio dei pellegrini medievali, cammineremo a piedi. Dopo settimane di cammino, domendo senza ripari e senza l’aiuto di molte delle comodità cui siamo abituati nella contemporaneità, saremo stanchi e dovremo superare ostacoli fisici e sofferenze. Rinunciando ai oderni mezzi di trasporto, sperimenteremo il rallentamento del tempo.Tutto questo cambierà la nostra percezione dell’opera d’arte. Certo, siamo consapevoli che non ci è possibile riportare in vita le esperienze e i sentimenti degli uomini del medioevo. Nonostante ciò siamo convinti che sia possibile, per molti versi, avvicinarci di più alla concezione pre-moderna dell’opera d’arte. Nell’epoca attuale, ci siamo abitutai a guardare all’opera d’arte in maniera frettolosa e con una prospetiva limitata. Il pellegrinaggio al ritmo del respiro umano offre un nuovo modo di osservazione, lo stesso che abbiamo già sperimentato nelle nostre camminate estive degli ultimi cinque anni.In questo modo, “Storici dell’arte migranti” presenta un innovativo approccio alla formazione. Dopo la preparazione teorica, gli studenti esamineranno le opere in situ con tutti i presupposti che abbiamo descritto. Il loro obiettivo sarà quello di presentare i propri elaborati non solo nel quadro dei programmi universitari ma anche di fare comunicazione in direzione del più vasto pubblico.Sebbene sperimentale e innovativo, il progetto “Storici dell’arte migranti” è basato su esperienze giò acquisite. Ha avuto origine dalle nostre osservazioni condotte sulle rotte del pellegrinaggio medievale in Italia e in Francia negli ultimi cinque anni. È per questo che un gruppo di dodici storici dell’arte hanno deciso di ampliare le proprie esperienze, di porle entro uno specifico contesto scientifico e di trasmetterle – con l’aiuto delle moderne tecnologie – ad un più vasto pubblico.È per questo che abbiamo bisogno di te!Abbiamo invitato specialisti a tenere corsi e a scrivere articoli per la monografia conclusiva. Noi stessi scriveremo delle opere d’arte che ci troveremo di fronte. Il nostro team comprende grafici esperti di editing e registi che lavoreranno alla piattaforma di e-learning della Masaryk University, forti della loro esperienza nella preparazione dei materiali di studio.Abbiamo bisogno di sostenitori entusiasti.Vogliamo condividere l’intera esperienza con te. Per “aprire” settori della storia dell’arte che sono solo apparentemente “chiusi”, desideriamo trasmettere al nostra esperienza al pubblico.È questa la ragione per cui abbiamo bisogno di fondi.  Con l’importo di 6300 Euro il Dipartimento di Storia dell’Arte della Masaryk University, che supporta il progetto, coprirà in parte i costi connessi con l’organizzazione dei delle conferenze nei diversi monasteri. Inoltre, abbiamo già raccolto 3000 Euro da sponsor privati.  Per poter trasmettere a voi i risultati del nostro viaggio abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto per coprire le spese legate alle riprese filmate e alla postproduzione. L’importo totale, comprensivo dell’equipaggiamento tecnologico, è stimato in 15965 Euro. La produzione del nostro secondo elaborato – una monografia dedicata alle opere da noi studiate, avrà il costo di 6000 Euro.Anche se la nostra vita in cammino sarà “low-cost”, è necessario un determinato sostegno per i costi cui dovremo far fronte nel viaggio. La stima di tali spese vive è stata tenuta il più possibile al ribasso, stabilendo un esborso pro capite di 7 Euro al giorno. Il che equivale a dire un totale di circa 10.080 Euro.Alcuni dei nostri studenti si guadagnano la vita da soli. Per questa ragione abbiamo bisogno di sostenere le loro necessità di base durante il cammino, dal momento che hanno dovuto interrompere la propria attività lavorativa per consacrarsi interamente al progetto.Abbiamo già intrapreso il pellegrinaggio a piedi cinque volte negli anni passati. Quindi non abbiamo bisogno di acquistare l’equipaggiamento di base. Questa volta però partiremo in inverno e, per questa ragione, dobbiamo integrare la nostra dotazione. La spesa prevista, a persona, è di 550 Euro, una somma che per alcuni studenti sarebbe difficile da mettere insieme.Ti saremmo molto grati se decidessi di sostenerci.Se il nostro progetto ti piace ma non puoi aiutarci finanziariamente, ti chiederemmo di inviare questo messaggio a tutte le persone cui pensi possa interessare. L'itinerario Da Losanna a Mont-Saint-Michel, 1500 chilometri che noi percorreremo a piedi in quattro mesi (dal 1 marzo alla fine di giugno), seguendo o intercettando tre grandi vie medievali di pellegrinaggio (Via Turonensis, Via Lemovicensis, Via Podiensis)Attraverseremo le città dove si trovano i più importanti monumenti oggetto delle nostre ricerche: Ginevra, Lione, Conques, Nevers, Fleury, Tours e Rennes. Cammineremo per tre settimane, seguite da una pausa di tre settimane da trascorrere nei monasteri di Conques, Saint Benoît sur Loire, Mont-Saint-Michel.Questi sono i luoghi dove i più prestigiosi studiosi del nostro campo ci incontreranno. Con una serie di conferenze e discussioni ci aiuteranno a portare avanti il nostro lavoro di ricerca, che confluirà nelle nostre tesi di Master e nella monografia finale.Questi sono i luoghi dove prepareremo film per te e dove manderemo in streaming online le conferenze destinate alla piattaforma e-learning della Masaryk University. Chi siamoGran parte dei partecipanti al progetto appartiene al Center for Early Medieval Studies della Masaryk University di Brno (Repubblica Ceca), fondato nel 2012 da Ivan Foletti. Il progetto è una delle molte attività del Centro. Fin dal momento della sua fondazione il Centro ha organizzato numerose conferenze internazionali ed ha invitato i più importanti studiosi del settore. Ha inoltre dato vita alla prestigiosa rivista internazionale Convivium e pubblica numerosi libri. Con il suo ciclo regolare di conferenze dal titolo StredoveC JinaX il Centro cerca il contatto anche con un pubblico non accademico.Le attività del Centro hanno attirato l’attenzione di uno fra i più importanti storici dell’arte, Hans Belting, che, insieme a Christa Belting-Ihm, ha donato al centro la propria collezione di volumi sull’arte medievale. Grazie alla qualità di tale acquisizione, il Centro è pervenuto al livello delle maggiori istituzioni europee.Gli altri membri del progetto, responsabili per le riprese filmate e per il supporto tecnologico, sono membri del team e-learning della Facoltà di Lettere della Masaryk university.Se vuoi saperne di più sui partecipanti guarda il nostro sito web.",32.0,4,"2 Campaigns

<p>I am an experienced online course creator and community organizer. The success of my flagship course, <strong>30 Days to Web Development</strong> has given me a deep understanding of the process of planning and creating an online course. Coder Problem Solving School will be video-based at the time of release.</p>
</div>
<h2>About the creator</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a young college student who enrolled in a 4-year Computer Science degree program.</p>
<p>She loved computers, and grew up making, breaking, and fixing things. In her early teens, she had coded her own online journal's template using HTML styles, So, a Computer Science should come naturally—right?</p>
<p>Fast forward to the day at the end of her freshman year. She sat in her major advisor's room, biting down on the inside of her lip to keep from crying, as he suggested that Computer Science may not have been the best fit to her, because she was clearly struggling. Maybe Information Technology would be more along her lines?</p>
<p>That day, she switched majors, and didn't look back.</p>
<p>If you haven't figured it out yet, that girl was me: <strong>Nicole Archambault.</strong></p>
<p>Today, I am an educational technology entrepreneur and front-end web developer. I absolutely love what I do!</p>
<p>But, back to college. I was so good with computers. What went wrong?</p>
<h2>We aren't taught logical problem solving skills.</h2>
<p>Computer Science 101-level classes were great! I was excited to see things happening, and knowing that I made them happen.</p>
<p>When I graduated on to Data Structures and Algorithms, the Computer Science degree <strong>began to rapidly increase in difficulty.</strong> Problem sets left me panicking, because there were so many abstract steps involved that I couldn't wrap my head around.</p>
<p>I had no idea how to approach a coding problem, and I didn't realize why until I was nearly 30 years old—when I decided once again to learn how to code, and become a developer. An undiagnosed non-verbal learning disability had only amplified my difficulties. (I probably could've gotten more time on those problem sets!)</p>
<p>All of my office hours time was spent asking about actual code, just to try to get something to work. But often, I wasn't even solving the problem I needed to solve. It was like I'd regularly get 2/3 way to a solution... then sputter out.</p>
<p><strong>I needed problem solving skills, y'all. And NOBODY was teaching them, especially not in traditional academic institutions.</strong></p>
<h2>Programmatic thinking and problem solving is a VERY different animal.</h2>
<p>Programmatic thinking and problem solving is <strong>very different from everyday problem solving</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, we follow the same steps as we go through our daily routines; steps that require many little steps. So, they'll look quite familiar early on:</p>
<p>You remove the hair dryer from your cabinet. You get your brush. You style your hair with the brush while drying it. You finish once your hair is completely dried and styled.</p>
<p>But, once the problems begin to get more complex and abstract, it's like doing something you haven't done before, for the first time. You may not know the order of steps, or what sub-steps are involved. You'll get lost fast.</p>
<p>If you've never built a house before, and you only know that the house is the final product—where do you even begin with understanding how to build each part?</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Problem solving skills will help your career.</h2>
<p>I'm a natural problem solver, as many of us are! But programmatic problem solving tripped me up.</p>
<p>We didn't have problem solving skill resources readily available to coders—particularly new coders.</p>
<p>The overwhelm that can come with being stuck on coding problems, and not getting the help you need, often leads new coders to believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>They're ""just not good at coding""</li>
<li>They're wasting their time</li>
<li>They'll never be able to learn enough to get a job</li>
</ul>
<p>By solving the problem of the lack of problem solving, we can bring in a fresh wave of problem solvers, ready to take on the world!</p>
<p>I am creating <strong>Coder Problem Solving School</strong> as a solution to the hundreds of responses I've heard from students over the years. Their feedback <i>clearly</i> tells me that people learning to code are not confident in their ability to approach algorithmic problems.</p>

Then, we'll kick it up a few notches and break down the specific steps of solving a coding problem:

Understanding the problem

Understanding problem domain

Determining your input

Determining your output


Pseudocoding your approach
Identifying edge cases


Common patterns in problem solving

Optimizing your solution

Scaling your solution

I am an experienced online course creator and community organizer. The success of my flagship course, 30 Days to Web Development has given me a deep understanding of the process of planning and creating an online course. Coder Problem Solving School will be video-based at the time of release.

About the creator
Once upon a time, there was a young college student who enrolled in a 4-year Computer Science degree program.
She loved computers, and grew up making, breaking, and fixing things. In her early teens, she had coded her own online journal's template using HTML styles, So, a Computer Science should come naturally—right?
Fast forward to the day at the end of her freshman year. She sat in her major advisor's room, biting down on the inside of her lip to keep from crying, as he suggested that Computer Science may not have been the best fit to her, because she was clearly struggling. Maybe Information Technology would be more along her lines?
That day, she switched majors, and didn't look back.
If you haven't figured it out yet, that girl was me: Nicole Archambault.
Today, I am an educational technology entrepreneur and front-end web developer. I absolutely love what I do!
But, back to college. I was so good with computers. What went wrong?
We aren't taught logical problem solving skills.
Computer Science 101-level classes were great! I was excited to see things happening, and knowing that I made them happen.
When I graduated on to Data Structures and Algorithms, the Computer Science degree began to rapidly increase in difficulty. Problem sets left me panicking, because there were so many abstract steps involved that I couldn't wrap my head around.
I had no idea how to approach a coding problem, and I didn't realize why until I was nearly 30 years old—when I decided once again to learn how to code, and become a developer. An undiagnosed non-verbal learning disability had only amplified my difficulties. (I probably could've gotten more time on those problem sets!)
All of my office hours time was spent asking about actual code, just to try to get something to work. But often, I wasn't even solving the problem I needed to solve. It was like I'd regularly get 2/3 way to a solution... then sputter out.
I needed problem solving skills, y'all. And NOBODY was teaching them, especially not in traditional academic institutions.
Programmatic thinking and problem solving is a VERY different animal.
Programmatic thinking and problem solving is very different from everyday problem solving.
Yes, we follow the same steps as we go through our daily routines; steps that require many little steps. So, they'll look quite familiar early on:
You remove the hair dryer from your cabinet. You get your brush. You style your hair with the brush while drying it. You finish once your hair is completely dried and styled.
But, once the problems begin to get more complex and abstract, it's like doing something you haven't done before, for the first time. You may not know the order of steps, or what sub-steps are involved. You'll get lost fast.
If you've never built a house before, and you only know that the house is the final product—where do you even begin with understanding how to build each part?

Problem solving skills will help your career.
I'm a natural problem solver, as many of us are! But programmatic problem solving tripped me up.
We didn't have problem solving skill resources readily available to coders—particularly new coders.
The overwhelm that can come with being stuck on coding problems, and not getting the help you need, often leads new coders to believe:

They're ""just not good at coding""
They're wasting their time
They'll never be able to learn enough to get a job

By solving the problem of the lack of problem solving, we can bring in a fresh wave of problem solvers, ready to take on the world!
I am creating Coder Problem Solving School as a solution to the hundreds of responses I've heard from students over the years. Their feedback clearly tells me that people learning to code are not confident in their ability to approach algorithmic problems.

If the course isn't for you, you'll probably know. These stories of fear and frustration simply won't resonate with you. The course itself will have a 30-day guarantee, and I'll personally refund you if you're not happy with it. (But you will be! ?)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Little design experience -- think how to design mechanisms in a robot that can have a specific motion, such as walking, scooping, launching, etc.</p><p>3. Coding-focused</p><p>4. Lack of Electronics Design and Prototyping -- think the joy of bread-boarding and dealing with the crippling reality of not having enough voltage for your motors. Now, that's fun.</p><p>5. Did not allow students to design their own custom robot parts -- want a curved piece? Sure,  do an injection molding run. Wait, that would be $10k+?</p><p>6. Lack of openness in choice of electronics parts and programming platform, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc. -- example: an ultrasonic sensor can be had for less than $2 on amazon.com, but the same capability in a high-end robot kit comes at a steep price of $35+.

<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>We have spent a lot of time figuring out the hardware. Now, we are excited to put this in your hands and have you design and build your own creation.</p>
<p>Worry not! We will provide many projects that you can simply start designing, prototyping, and programming with. We are confident that even if you followed our instructions, you will still end up with something different than what we thought. </p>
<p>We have been operating out of an incubator, but now our challenge at this time is to set up a manufacturing facility where we can laser cut parts and for that we need two primary equipment: a laser cutter and a fume extraction system. We estimate that a starter version of these two pieces of equipment will cost no less than $20k, but a higher powered and bigger laser cutter made and sold in U.S. (not the cheap ones made in China) themselves can cost as much as $35k.</p>
<p>Your backing of this project will allow us to offset the cost of the equipment and also allow us to buy raw material and electronics for the perks.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of your participation in this project has far-reaching consequences. </p>
<p>Our goal is to make Robotics affordable and fun for everyone without sacrificing the authenticity of design and engineering experience.</p>
<p>We believe that every student deserves to have a robot kit of their own so that they can continue to learn with it without worrying about breaking things. SnappyXO makes that possible. It is low-cost and craft-like feel lowers the barrier for experimentation. </p>
<p>Your backing will, of course, help us raise some capital for manufacturing. However, we want you to be part of our journey to develop this product and bring to the general market by providing us with your input and feedback. To us, that is of far greater importance.</p>
<p>At this time, STEM education has huge socio-economic implications. Consider following:</p>
<p>1. The U.S. Department of Labor estimated that in 2018, 2.5 million STEM jobs went unfilled,<br/>which at an average pay of $85,000 per year for such jobs translates to $200 billion in lost wages.</p>
<p>2. Robotics education, which brings several STEM topics together, has a great potential to create a workforce that is prepared to tackle the technical challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p>3. 78% of high school graduates are not prepared to take STEM classes at college level.</p>
<p>SnappyXO could relieve some of those pain points.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>We have manufactured hundreds of these kits  and have reduced risks to a large extent. However, we are still reliant on our plastic and electronics suppliers for manufacturing and the mechatronics components. We will need them timely and on a cost-effective basis. Fortunately, we have several suppliers from whom we can purchase raw materials and working with the off-the-shelf electronics means that we have a lot more choices.</p>
<p>Our other challenge is the actual manufacturing as we need to set up a proper laser cutting facility with adequate fume extraction and ventilation set up. A successful campaign will mitigate these challenges to a large extent.</p>
<p>The question is not that whether we can deliver or not, because we can, but how painful it will be for us. </p>

A Stony Brook University professor, who is also a member of the U.S. National Academy of Inventors begins teaching a new Freshman Design Robotics class created with support from a Teaching Innovation grant from the NY state. The goal of the class?To provide students with an authentic exposure to design, coding and circuits through a project oriented approach.  With the use of robotics, students would learn these three core concepts in a hands-on fashion.  It was here that he realized a fundamental problem with his plan: the cost and lack of versatility of a robotics kit.The professor and his students began to create something that would provide an authentic and affordable design-driven robotics education.For everyone. Not just college kids.Meet SnappyXO  - the world's first  STEM/Robotics education product meant for students all the way from elementary to college students.  http://www.snappyxo.comCurious to see what his students made from SnappyXO? See this short highlights video from his class project.Please note that all the robots in the above video use a cheaper grade translucent plastic called Acrylic. That's great for prototyping, but our backers here will get everything made in super strong and durable plastic called Acetal. And, they come in colors too.Now and FutureSoon, the word got out. Several K-12 schools, STEM camps, after-school STEM/Robotics programs, hackathon, and makerfaire in Long Island where Stony Brook University is located joined the chorus and asked if SnappyXO could work for a larger range of students?
So, Mechanismic Inc. was formed in 2017 to investigate this possibility.
Then, Mechanismic received a highly prestigious and selective grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) SBIR/STTR program earlier this year to develop this cool Robotics Education product. 

 
2019 is an epochal year.
In the summer of 2019, we created a unified hardware that would work for kids all the way from elementary to high-school and college students.  Makers and hackers would love this too.
So, now we have tiers of kits for everyone. Hurray! 

Problems and Limitations with Existing Robotics Products:1. Too costly -- $350+. Gasp!2. Little design experience -- think how to design mechanisms in a robot that can have a specific motion, such as walking, scooping, launching, etc.3. Coding-focused4. Lack of Electronics Design and Prototyping -- think the joy of bread-boarding and dealing with the crippling reality of not having enough voltage for your motors. Now, that's fun.5. Did not allow students to design their own custom robot parts -- want a curved piece? Sure,  do an injection molding run. Wait, that would be $10k+?6. Lack of openness in choice of electronics parts and programming platform, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc. -- example: an ultrasonic sensor can be had for less than $2 on amazon.com, but the same capability in a high-end robot kit comes at a steep price of $35+. Ouch!That class needed a robot kit that provided for significant design experiences rather than just coding. They did not want to follow a manual to create their highly personalized robots. They could not. They asked for something affordable and intuitive. In addition, they wanted to choose their electronics and their programming platform. Again, why? Because...The goal is education, not cookie-cutter Robotics.What is SnappyXO?SnappyXO consists of hardware, which are our own plastic components, such as beams, plates, connectors, gears, wheels, etc. and a mechatronics kit containing sensors, actuators, microcontroller, and misc. electronics.The mechatronics kit components are open source, inexpensive, and off-the-shelf. Which means that you can rapidly move on to another programming platform or buy more and better electronic components.1. HardwareSnappyXO contains a patent-pending hardware kit made from high precision laser-cut parts from flat sheets of Acetal plastic. The hardware is a set of minimalistic pieces, which allows one to create 3D structures and moving systems.It is completely customizable and works with the off-the-shelf electronics and any open source programming platforms, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Micro:bit. The method of assembly is unique and novel. Yet, it's very intuitive and does not need too many different parts. A smattering of SnappyXO hardware parts laid against a green colored sheet2. AppsMotionGen: SnappyXO comes with MotionGen, the only Android and iOS app of its kind in the world, is developed on top of the state of the art research in Mechanisms and Robotics done at Stony Brook University. There is a version available on the app stores already, but will be updated soon to allow more functionality. It allows one to design and simulate robot motions. You can design a robot motion in the app and can prototype it using the hardware kit and see it come to life! You can also import images of existing mechanisms and see how they work.Use MotionGen app to design custom mechanisms for SnappyXO and beyond.MotionGen is in V1 right now and is constantly being updated. ArduinoBlue: We will also provide an app to control robot motions over Bluetooth called ArduinoBlue, which works with Arduino family of Mircontroller boards and SnappyXO Robot kit. It's currently available on the app stores. Control your SnappyXO creation using your smartphone! SnappyXO is designed for easy integration with ArduinoBlue.SnappyXO provides authentic STEM education and Robot Design experience.    So, here we are!After having tested it in numerous classes, schools, STEM camps, and hackathon, we are super excited to bring this product to the backers at Indiegogo. A successful campaign will help us set up our manufacturing (laser cutter and fume extractor) to create the product and deliver to you in time for the holidays.Students posing with their robots from different summer Robotics camps in 2019 Stony Brook University Freshman Robotics Students' Project
What We Need and What You Get
We have spent a lot of time figuring out the hardware. Now, we are excited to put this in your hands and have you design and build your own creation.
Worry not! We will provide many projects that you can simply start designing, prototyping, and programming with. We are confident that even if you followed our instructions, you will still end up with something different than what we thought. 
We have been operating out of an incubator, but now our challenge at this time is to set up a manufacturing facility where we can laser cut parts and for that we need two primary equipment: a laser cutter and a fume extraction system. We estimate that a starter version of these two pieces of equipment will cost no less than $20k, but a higher powered and bigger laser cutter made and sold in U.S. (not the cheap ones made in China) themselves can cost as much as $35k.
Your backing of this project will allow us to offset the cost of the equipment and also allow us to buy raw material and electronics for the perks.

Perks

The Impact
The impact of your participation in this project has far-reaching consequences. 
Our goal is to make Robotics affordable and fun for everyone without sacrificing the authenticity of design and engineering experience.
We believe that every student deserves to have a robot kit of their own so that they can continue to learn with it without worrying about breaking things. SnappyXO makes that possible. It is low-cost and craft-like feel lowers the barrier for experimentation. 
Your backing will, of course, help us raise some capital for manufacturing. However, we want you to be part of our journey to develop this product and bring to the general market by providing us with your input and feedback. To us, that is of far greater importance.
At this time, STEM education has huge socio-economic implications. Consider following:
1. The U.S. Department of Labor estimated that in 2018, 2.5 million STEM jobs went unfilled,which at an average pay of $85,000 per year for such jobs translates to $200 billion in lost wages.
2. Robotics education, which brings several STEM topics together, has a great potential to create a workforce that is prepared to tackle the technical challenges of the 21st century.
3. 78% of high school graduates are not prepared to take STEM classes at college level.
SnappyXO could relieve some of those pain points.
Andy from AndysTechGarage saw us at the Eastern Long Island Makerfaire and made this wonderful video, which touches upon some of the problems we have mentioned above.

<h3>WELCOME TO THE GREATNESS MOVEMENT!<br/>
</h3>
<p>My name is DeAndre Carter and I am an urban kid with global dreams. My passion has driven me to share my message of inspiration in a way that will change lives all over the world!<br/></p>
<p>I am a prime example of the adage ""It's not about where you start, but where you finish that counts"".  Life did not deal me a 'fair' hand. Growing up in the inner city of Detroit exposed me to poverty, adversity and despair. Being raised in a household without my father presented many unpleasant challenges for me during childhood. Despite the hardships, I found a way to motivate myself and others along the way. This 'Cody Boy' grew up to become a ""Spartan Man"", but it was not an easy process. <br/></p>
<p>As a graduate from Michigan State University's business school, I became the first person in my family to earn a degree from a major 4-year university. Growing up on the streets of Detroit taught me many things. One of the most valuable lessons I learned was the need to believe in yourself at all times. Life will challenge you with adversity to test the level of your desire. I have passed the test and now I want to help you do the same. Another valuable life lesson was the amazing feeling I would get when I helped others to become their best. This was an early clue that it is my purpose to inspire people to achieve greatness.<br/></p>
<p>This brings me to the heart of this campaign. My purpose is to inspire this generation to pursue and achieve greatness. I have written a book called ""Demand Greatness: 4 Keys to Unleash Your Potential"".  My book will touch hearts, inspire minds and motivate each reader to become the best version of themselves. This is important to me because I have spent the past 18 years speaking to audiences across the country and the response has been the same every where I go...<b> DEANDRE, WE WANT MORE! <br/></b></p>
<br/><p></p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3>THIS IS MORE THAN A BOOK; IT'S A MOVEMENT! <br/>
</h3>
<p>Demand Greatness is more than a book, this is a movement because your life cannot 
stay in the same place after you get this message in you. You will be motivated to 
be on the MOVE! This is the game changer you've been waiting for. This 
is your moment. This is your time. If you believe in greatness, then I 
believe in you!<br/></p>
<p>""Demand Greatness"" is the next step creating a Greatness Movement that will help people change their lives from the inside out. My mission is to instill a 'culture of positive belief' in the hearts of youth, educators, and entrepreneurs across the globe.  Your donation today will bring the Greatness Movement one step closer to changing lives everywhere . </p>

My name is DeAndre Carter and I am an urban kid with global dreams. My passion has driven me to share my message of inspiration in a way that will change lives all over the world!
I am a prime example of the adage ""It's not about where you start, but where you finish that counts"".  Life did not deal me a 'fair' hand. Growing up in the inner city of Detroit exposed me to poverty, adversity and despair. Being raised in a household without my father presented many unpleasant challenges for me during childhood. Despite the hardships, I found a way to motivate myself and others along the way. This 'Cody Boy' grew up to become a ""Spartan Man"", but it was not an easy process. 
As a graduate from Michigan State University's business school, I became the first person in my family to earn a degree from a major 4-year university. Growing up on the streets of Detroit taught me many things. One of the most valuable lessons I learned was the need to believe in yourself at all times. Life will challenge you with adversity to test the level of your desire. I have passed the test and now I want to help you do the same. Another valuable life lesson was the amazing feeling I would get when I helped others to become their best. This was an early clue that it is my purpose to inspire people to achieve greatness.
This brings me to the heart of this campaign. My purpose is to inspire this generation to pursue and achieve greatness. I have written a book called ""Demand Greatness: 4 Keys to Unleash Your Potential"".  My book will touch hearts, inspire minds and motivate each reader to become the best version of themselves. This is important to me because I have spent the past 18 years speaking to audiences across the country and the response has been the same every where I go... DEANDRE, WE WANT MORE! 



THIS IS MORE THAN A BOOK; IT'S A MOVEMENT! 

Demand Greatness is more than a book, this is a movement because your life cannot 
stay in the same place after you get this message in you. You will be motivated to 
be on the MOVE! This is the game changer you've been waiting for. This 
is your moment. This is your time. If you believe in greatness, then I 
believe in you!
""Demand Greatness"" is the next step creating a Greatness Movement that will help people change their lives from the inside out. My mission is to instill a 'culture of positive belief' in the hearts of youth, educators, and entrepreneurs across the globe.  Your donation today will bring the Greatness Movement one step closer to changing lives everywhere . 

(Display: This is not the actual book cover) DONATE TODAY AND GREATNESS WILL BE ON THE WAY!

YOUR SUPPORT IS NEEDED





My selection of a publisher was a tedious process that eventually led me to a company with a track record of integrity, excellence and success. Spirit Reign Communications & Publishing is known for publishing works by many authors including Eric Thomas (""ET The Hip Hop Preacher""), author of ""The Secrets to Success"" and ""Greatness Is Upon You"". They have a firm understanding of what it takes to support, promote and partner with an author like myself. I am committed to changing the world with a message of hope, resilience and grit. Spirit Reign Communications & Publishing has proven that they are capable of providing the literary support needed to accomplish greatness.  Your support can help to create the next life changing success story!

  

HOW WILL DONATIONS BE USED?

Now that you know why I am excited to publish this book, let me explain where funds will be allocated:
*Funding from this campaign will cover costs for the following:
*Printing, production and shipping costs for 3000 high quality hard cover books
*Book cover design, layout, editing services
*E-book creation and official listing with online book providers
*Marketing services and materials needed to successfully promote the book upon release
*Hiring marketing interns to assist with the successful promotional launch for the book
*Fees and costs associated with managing this fundraising campaign

PERKS: 



One of the most exciting parts of this campaign for me is the ability to provide perks to my supporters. During the past 18 years of my speaking career I have met some of the most amazing, kind-hearted and generous people along the way. This portion of the campaign allows me to show thanks and appreciation for their support while also giving me the opportunity to welcome new supporters. If you have not heard any of my messages I guarantee that you are in for a direction changing shift in your life. 
To my loyal supporters: This is the day that we have been waiting for! 
This book campaign and publishing process has been long anticipated. 
Your support has inspired me to write this book and now your support 
will help to get it published.To my new supporters: I am excited
 for you to join me on this journey of greatness. Your introduction my 
work will be an amazing experience that is sure to deliver a major dose 
of motivation. 

The donation packages listed on the right side of your screen explains all the perks you will get in exchange for your donation. My favorite set of packages are the Demand Greatness Bronze-Diamond kits. They include the exclusive success coaching sessions (valued at $197) that will help you to create the specific results you are looking for in your life.  Starting as low as $100, these packages allow me to connect and coach you on a more personal level while also offering additional unique perks. The Demand Greatness Starter Kit is packed with awesome value. You will get both a hard copy ($24.99 value) and electronic version of my book while also being entered into a raffle for a cool dining experience as well. 
WHAT IF FUNDING FALLS SHORT?
Every IndieGoGo campaign does not reach it's desired goal. In such cases the fees and costs for managing the campaign are approximately 5% higher than instances where the campaign does reach the funding goal. You can rest assured that if my campaign does not reach it's goal then I will commit myself to find the additional funds needed to make this book a reality. HOWEVER, I must state that I am 100% confident that my supporters will help us to achieve this goal. I take nothing for granted, but I know that people who believe in The Greatness Movement will come through on this campaign in a big way!THIS IS HISTORY IN THE MAKING!

BECOME A DIFFERENCE MAKER TODAY!
This campaign is a true game changer. When you make a contribution, your dollars are making a difference.  When you share this mission with others, you are spreading a message of hope that will inspire people to act on their dreams. When you promote the idea of creating a Greatness Movement, YOU are truly impacting lives. ""A rising tide lifts all ships""; that is symbolic of what is happening with the Greatness Movement. One by one entrepreneurs, business professionals, educators, college students, community leaders and youth all over the country are seeing their lives go to the next level through the messages shared within this book. Publishing and distributing this powerful material will only multiply the number of people who will be inspired to achieve greatness. 

  CAN YOU SEE THE POTENTIAL?



A successful fundraising campaign for The Greatness Movement will result in the book being published December 2014!  We will enter 2015 equipped with excitement and a message that will inspire every person who we connect with. Looking toward the future, I would love to start a scholarship program that gives support to those who need it most. We are also preparing seminars (live and online) to inspire, education and empower the next generation of achievers to be their best in all they do. As you see this vision is coming to pass. Be a part of this history making movement. We need your support!

What We Do
We
believe that the dramatic arts encourage individuality, creativity, and a deep

What
never ceases to amaze us is the dedication and excitement our students have for
learning these theater skills that allow them to better not only themselves but
their community as well.  It is an
incredible thing to watch them grow not only as individuals but also as a

I am 15 years old and a current sophomore. I heard about the London Theatre Trip through school and was completely ecstatic. I have wanted to go to another country since I was in third grade. I love the concept of an entire different place with a completely different social and economical system than the US. I have a particular fondness with the UK, having done about 3 reports on it through the years. I am also addicted to the theatre. I think its beautiful how actors tell a story through dance and powerful statements. I have also memorized at least 3 soundtracks. </span></h3>
</div><div>
<p>If I get enough money, I have a chance to go on a trip to London with my school. We get to travel to Stratford, Salisbury, Bath, Stonehenge, as well as London. We get to follow Shakespeare's footsteps, go to a theatre workshop, meet some of the actors ( :O) and do regular touristy stuff, such as the Tower of London and Changing of the Guard. </p>
<p>When I heard about the trip, I was super excited and wanted to go but didn't tell my mom because I knew it would be a lot for our family. Then my mom found out on her own and decided that she would do anything so I had the chance to go. Being a single mom, she's already got a lot on her plate so I decided to get the funds myself. The trip cost $5,000 and I want to raise as much as I possibly can. But being a full time student, getting a traditional job is pretty hard, especially since I can't drive. So I am hoping that selling stuff on eBay and donations will cover it. The more, the better!</p>
<p>In today's society, we need more kids getting out into the world and seeing what there is out there. To explore and not just follow as their parents did, but branch out. It is a really big world out there and I have only seen a small part of it. Help me see more!</p>

I have a particular fondness with the UK, having done about 3 reports on it through the years. I am also addicted to the theatre. I think its beautiful how actors tell a story through dance and powerful statements. I have also memorized at least 3 soundtracks. 

If I get enough money, I have a chance to go on a trip to London with my school. We get to travel to Stratford, Salisbury, Bath, Stonehenge, as well as London. We get to follow Shakespeare's footsteps, go to a theatre workshop, meet some of the actors ( :O) and do regular touristy stuff, such as the Tower of London and Changing of the Guard. 
When I heard about the trip, I was super excited and wanted to go but didn't tell my mom because I knew it would be a lot for our family. Then my mom found out on her own and decided that she would do anything so I had the chance to go. Being a single mom, she's already got a lot on her plate so I decided to get the funds myself. The trip cost $5,000 and I want to raise as much as I possibly can. But being a full time student, getting a traditional job is pretty hard, especially since I can't drive. So I am hoping that selling stuff on eBay and donations will cover it. The more, the better!
In today's society, we need more kids getting out into the world and seeing what there is out there. To explore and not just follow as their parents did, but branch out. It is a really big world out there and I have only seen a small part of it. Help me see more!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>About Me and My Campaign</b></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Bradley Krueger. I'm also a conductor. After finishing my Master's degree in Choral Conducting
at Andrews University, I have served as Director of Music at First
Presbyterian Church of South Bend, Indiana since 2009. With a BA in Vocal
Performance from Union College (NE), I also attended the <i>Aspen Music
Festival and School</i> in Vocal Concert studies. I also have the distinction of being a Foundationer (charter member) of the first <i>Tallis Scholars Summer School</i> in England where I studied and performed a cappella choral music of the Renaissance. I also attended conducting workshops at the <i>Lucerne Festival Academy </i>with
Pierre Boulez and Rider University’s <i>Choral Music
Institute at Oxford</i> with James Jordan and James Whitbourn. </p>
<p>Quite recently,
I was accepted to participate in the <i>4th International Sasha Mäkilä
Conducting Masterclass</i> in Mikkeli, Finland with the St. Michel
Strings.</p>
<p>This tremendous opportunity, in Mikkeli, has the potential to raise my conducting skills to a high level while
working with Finland's third oldest professional orchestra under the insightful
guidance of Maestro Mäkilä. In addition to the ample podium time conducting the
St. Michel Strings, the workshop takes place concurrently with the<i> XXII
Gergiev Festival Mikkeli. </i>As participants, we will be able to observe all
the rehearsals of Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra. Maestro
Gergiev is arguably one of the world's foremost conductors working today.</p>
<p>The Masterclass' repertoire includes:</p>
<p>Barber: Adagio
for Strings</p>
<p>Dvořák:
Serenade for Strings</p>
<p>Mendelssohn:
Concerto for Violin and Strings in D minor</p>
<p>Sibelius:
Presto from String Quartet op. 4</p>
<p>Stravinsky:
Concerto in D (Study Only)</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky:
Elegy for Ivan Samarin</p><p>Turina:
Oracion del Torero</p>
<p><br/></p><p>To learn more about the program follow this link: </p><p><a href=""http://www.mikkelinkaupunginorkesteri.fi/Masterclass/mikkeli.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.mikkelinkaupunginorkesteri.fi/Masterclass/mikkeli.html</span></a></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What I Need
&amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>As the US
Dollar is weak against the Euro, tuition is high - about $1700 - depending on the
currency exchange.  To keep the budget to a minimum I have made arrangements to stay in a private home rather than a hotel and will prepare my own meals as often as possible. My traveling expenses from the United States to Europe have
been taken care of and I have already purchased my music scores.</p>
<p>Expenses are as follows:</p>
<p>• Tuition:
$1,700</p>
<p>• Train
from Helsinki to Mikkeli and back: $65</p>
<p>• One-Way
flight to Helsinki from Berlin: $165</p>
<p>•Subtotal = $1930</p>
<p>•Final Goal = $2000 (rounded down after factoring in Indiegogo fees which are 4% of the goal if the goal is met)</p>
<p>This
workshop doesn't accept credit cards so tuition has to be paid in full
with cash or wire transfer. And if my goal
isn’t reached, Indiegogo takes 9% of the donations as opposed to 4% if the goal is met.  Nevertheless, any contribution would be greatly appreciated and would be helpful.</p><p>Also, please notice that your donation has a featured perk incentive,
which can be selected from the column at the right!</p>
<p><b>The Impact of
your donation</b></p>
<p>This is a tremendous opportunity for me to make significant strides as a conductor. Past participants have expressed how this masterclass has taught them to envision the orchestra's  palette of colors, encourage musicians through dialogue and technique and most of all, showcase the music.  This masterclass will hold a prominent distinction in my <i>Curriculum Vitae </i>as I apply for future musical and academic advancement. I will also establish working relationships with several outstanding world-class musicians, in the orchestra and among the participating conductors. </p>
<p>This program,
out of all the workshops I’ve attended, will enable me to further my
career and project me one step further in fulfilling my dreams as a conductor to spread joy, hope and love through music.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You
Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you are
unable to donate and you would still like to help, you may do so by promoting
my campaign by posting this link on various social networking websites like
Facebook, Google +, LinkedIn, Twitter, and email.</p>
<p>Because I
encountered Indiegogo rather late in the game, I have about 14 days to reach my
goal, as it takes about three weeks for the funds to be processed and
transferred and ultimately wired to Finland by June 27. Anything you can do
to help will be deeply appreciated.</p>

What I Need
& What You Get
As the US
Dollar is weak against the Euro, tuition is high - about $1700 - depending on the
currency exchange.  To keep the budget to a minimum I have made arrangements to stay in a private home rather than a hotel and will prepare my own meals as often as possible. My traveling expenses from the United States to Europe have
been taken care of and I have already purchased my music scores.
Expenses are as follows:
• Tuition:
$1,700
• Train
from Helsinki to Mikkeli and back: $65
• One-Way
flight to Helsinki from Berlin: $165
•Subtotal = $1930
•Final Goal = $2000 (rounded down after factoring in Indiegogo fees which are 4% of the goal if the goal is met)
This
workshop doesn't accept credit cards so tuition has to be paid in full
with cash or wire transfer. And if my goal
isn’t reached, Indiegogo takes 9% of the donations as opposed to 4% if the goal is met.  Nevertheless, any contribution would be greatly appreciated and would be helpful.Also, please notice that your donation has a featured perk incentive,
which can be selected from the column at the right!
The Impact of
your donation
This is a tremendous opportunity for me to make significant strides as a conductor. Past participants have expressed how this masterclass has taught them to envision the orchestra's  palette of colors, encourage musicians through dialogue and technique and most of all, showcase the music.  This masterclass will hold a prominent distinction in my Curriculum Vitae as I apply for future musical and academic advancement. I will also establish working relationships with several outstanding world-class musicians, in the orchestra and among the participating conductors. 
This program,
out of all the workshops I’ve attended, will enable me to further my
career and project me one step further in fulfilling my dreams as a conductor to spread joy, hope and love through music.
Other Ways You
Can Help
If you are
unable to donate and you would still like to help, you may do so by promoting
my campaign by posting this link on various social networking websites like
Facebook, Google +, LinkedIn, Twitter, and email.
Because I
encountered Indiegogo rather late in the game, I have about 14 days to reach my
goal, as it takes about three weeks for the funds to be processed and
transferred and ultimately wired to Finland by June 27. Anything you can do
to help will be deeply appreciated.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Dilia Zwart, Freya Nowell, and Sho Igawa have volunteered with youth projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for a number of years. Their experiences with young people in BiH have inspired them to give back and develop an innovative model of youth empowerment.</p>
<p>BiH has an overall unemployment rate of over 40%. The youth unemployment rate is even higher, at 60%, <b>one of the most severe in the world</b>.

The project in Costa Rica is program of Amigos de las Américas (AMIGOS), a non-profit organization that trains high-school and college age participants to carry out youth leadership, public health, and community development projects.

AMIGOS is partnered with Casa de la Juventud (CASA), who have organized youth in Perez Zeledon through informal and formal educational activities for over 20 years.  They began collaborating with AMIGOS in 2004 and in 2012 co-launched the national park program, piloting the model as it currently stands.

<p><b><u>KIDS CLIMB FOR NEPAL</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b>The climbing kids in
Albury, NSW want to help the people of Nepal, so I have set them a climbing
challenge. I am hoping that you can support them as they scale the great
heights of Albury Indoor Climbing Centre to help those in need.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The scale of
the devastation following the Nepal earthquakes is enormous and the people need
our ongoing support. People have lost
their loved ones, with the death toll over 8500 and some 20,000 injured, houses
reduced to rubble with entire villages flattened and 100,000’s made homeless. With
ongoing aftershocks, the heavy monsoon rain, lack of shelter and the threat of
further landslides and disease, people are living in fear and uncertainty about
what the future will bring. It is impossible to imagine the deep psychological
effects these devastating events are having on those affected and how this has
impacted their mental health.</p>
<p>The spirit of Nepal and its air of mysticism
captures your heart like nowhere else. It may be one of the world’s poorest countries,
but within the people, their culture, the mountains… there lies a richness that
no amount of money can rival. I have never encountered such truly happy,
infectious smiles amongst a nation. I want to give something back to a country
that has given so much to me &amp; many others.</p>
<p>My name is
Lisa Exley. My desire to help and
support Nepal in their time of great need is strong and the kids at my local
indoor climbing centre in Albury, NSW also want to help.<span>  So with the support of Chris Brown at Albury
Climbing Centre I have set the kids an exciting challenge.  On Saturday 13<sup>th</sup> June I have
challenged the kids to climb as many indoor routes as possible within a 3 hour
time period. This is a test of their
resilience, endurance, determination, perseverance, courage……traits which
reflect those of our Nepalese neighbours. 
These traits, along with our help will enable the people of Nepal to
rebuild their lives.</span></p>
<p>Through this
Indiegogo campaign I hope to raise funds for the Australian Himalayan
Foundation (AHF), a well respected, not for profit charitable organisation who
for a number of years have had ongoing projects in Nepal focusing on health,
education and conservation. The AHF sent a disaster recovery team into the area
it works, and the team provided relief &amp; medical aid, delivery of tarps,
and assistance to those who were most in need, particularly in the communities
where they have been assisting for many years. They have also reported damage
to many of the schools they support in the lower Solu Khumbu region. Temporary
classrooms are being used to make sure the education they support is ongoing. Getting
the children back to learning can be one powerful means of helping to heal
their emotional scars. Children in crisis benefit from the sense of normalcy provided
by continued education. The process of rebuilding will be a long term project.
Any excess funds that remain after the immediate emergency response period will
go into the long term restoration of the communities in which the AHF work.
Your donation will go towards helping children, families and schools in
hundreds of communities.</p>
<p>I am asking
everyone who sees this campaign to please give. Give by donating what you would
normally spend on a cuppa this morning. I appreciate that not everyone is in a
position to give and many people have already generously donated. If you can’t,
then please give by sharing this campaign. Share it on facebook, twitter,
email, word of mouth, at schools, community centres etc</p>
<p>Awareness is
vital to make change happen.</p>

donation, no matter how small, makes a difference. Let us help to bring back
those happy, infectious smiles of the beautiful Nepalese people. </p>

<h3><br/></h3><h3>THE
OPPORTUNITY:</h3>
<p>Imagine that
all that stands between you and a better life for your family is a certificate.
Now imagine that the test you need to take to obtain that certificate is being
administered on a technology you've never seen before and is in a language you
can't understand.</p>
<p>This is the
challenge our adult learners face as they work to complete their GED. For these
students, many of whom are returning to school for the first time in 10-15
years, they face a double-hurdle: not only do they need to master the subject
area content to pass the test, but they must also learn to use the technology
as well. </p>
<p>The GED Lab
is an intensive and comprehensive model designed to help adult students acquire
the technology skills and knowledge they need to continue their education. In
turn they will get better jobs, earn a living wage, and improve their lives and
the lives of their families.</p>
<h3>WHAT IT
COSTS:</h3>
<p>It costs $30
to take each of the 4 sections of the GED, for a total of $120. We have found
that each of our students, after studying for months to learn the content and get used
to the technology, will still need several tries for each section – when your
whole future was riding on a very expensive test, you’d get nervous, too! From
our observation, students average 8 re-takes – which, plus materials like
calculators and prep books and support from staff and volunteer instructors – totals approximately $312 per student per session.</p>
<p>To provide
this Lab to 8 students per session, for 4 sessions in 2014, our total program
budget is $10,000.</p>
<h3>WHAT THE
FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR:</h3>
<p>Students
participating in the program will receive:</p>

suggests that test-takers who demonstrate fluency with the skills measured in

</div></div>","Detaining people pre-trial on charges which would not lead to a prison sentence is disproportionate, damaging, and wasteful of public funds.


Rather than serving us by protecting our rights, as charged by the Constitution, the government has goals and objectives of its own, often in conflict with our rights. While we may have all the rights (the Constitution specifically says so), the government has all the power. 

What they say Electric Monitoring is:

Home confinement is a tool that helps U.S. probation and pretrial services officers supervise, or monitor, defendants and offenders in the community. In the federal courts, home confinement is not a sentence in and of itself but may be a condition of either probation, parole, supervised release, or pretrial release.  A person placed under home confinement is confined to his or her residence, usually linked to an electronic monitoring or GPS system, and required to maintain a strict daily activity schedule. When the person is allowed to leave home, and for what reasons, is determined case by case. Home confinement’s purpose depends on the phase of the criminal justice process in which it is used.  In all cases, it is a means to restrict a person’s activity and to protect the public from any threat the person may pose. In pretrial cases were a person has not been tried, home confinement is an alternative to detention used to assist in ensuring community safety. In post-sentence cases, home confinement is used as a punishment, viewed as more punitive than regular supervision but less restrictive than imprisonment. Courts may use home confinement as a sanction for persons who violate the conditions of their supervision. Also, the Bureau of Prisons may use it for inmates released to serve the last part of their sentence under the supervision of U.S. probation officers.  A person placed under home confinement is . . . usually linked to an electronic monitoring or GPS system. Home confinement benefits the courts in that it costs much less than incarceration.  Moreover, courts may order persons placed under home confinement to pay all or part of monitoring costs. Home confinement also enables defendants and offenders to continue to contribute to the support of their families and pay taxes.


What Electric Monitoring is:


In most cases electronic monitoring programs operate under questionable legal frameworks, typically excluding or minimizing any rights or entitlements for the people being monitored.  There are several rights that the condition of Full House Arrest on electronic monitoring violates including:



The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion and/or impeding the free exercise of religion. The State of Texas has violated peoples 1st Amendment Right to exercise their religion by using Full House Arrest with electronic monitoring as a condition of bond release.

     condition on people who have not been tried in a court. The
     Amendment also has a Due Process Clause which states, ‘no person shall be
     deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law
     (similar to the one in the 14th Amendment).  Full House Arrest with electronic monitoring deprives people of their right to life, liberty, and property without due process of the law.  There is not any precedent case that can be found that prohibits the courts from confining a person to their home while awaiting trial, so judges are able to place this burden upon anyone.

<p><b>We need sustainable safe havens</b></p>
<p>After working successfully as sustainability professionals for over 20 years, we could not help seeing parallels between the transition to a cleaner energy system and solutions for the Middle East refugee crisis. </p>
<p>Both challenges need a combination of fresh ideas and proven solutions and in both cases the solution cannot (easily) be delivered by the current political system alone. So we need grassroots people like you to push the system in the right direction. </p>
<p>The good news is that such transitions can succeed. With your help we can create a sustainably safe future for many Middle East refugees as well. </p>
<p>Millions of
people have fled their homes in Middle East conflict zones. Creating safe
havens in those regions is a good idea but GreenfieldCities strives to jump to
a next level and create safe &amp; prospering havens that offer a real sustainable future. We call them Greenfield
cities. </p>
<p><b>Together we can do it</b></p>
<p>A crazy
idea?  We don’t think so.  Bold? Definitely! But everything we propose and think of has been
done before. And with your help we are going to deliver a city size grassroots
solution the international community is looking for.  </p>
<p>We aim to  completely stop conflict driven mass migration from
the Middle East, by offering displaced people much better
opportunities than Europe or other western countries will ever be able to
deliver. We also believe that Greenfield cities can foster long term
regional stability. </p>
<p>The basic
principle is simple: think and act long term and empower people and capital</p>
<p><span> -</span>Don’t
create safe yet temporary refugee camps, 
but switch to the idea of creating real new cities with a long term view and sustainable prosperity in mind. The EU or UN should commit themselves for 50 years or longer to secure universal human rights in those areas.</p>
<p>-When
the EU or UN commit to securing safety, universal rights and a special economic
status in one or more areas the size of Hong Kong or New York  (roughly 30 by 30 kilometers, 20 by 20 miles)
for 50 years or more, then people in pursuit of happiness and prosperity will, with some help, nurse that city into a success story. </p>
<p>-Set
aside the colonial taboo! Especially for the Greenfield host country, an
international Greenfield partnership will be a once in a lifetime opportunity. The host country will attract a lot of investment and have a positive and prominent seat at the global diplomatic table. Ans since this is a temporary lease, the territory will eventually be under full control of the host country again. </p>
<p>Now, we are the first to admit that there are significant risks and challenges to overcome. Trying new things is never easy, and doing so near conflict zones makes it even harder. Yes, extraordinary challenges,  but with millions of people looking for solutions and a new future, there are also countless opportunities. By starting small and lining up broad and strong partnerships we think risks are manageable. </p>
<p><b>This is what we propose to do</b></p>
<p>We'll invest the initial funding to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Invite refugees that are now in the Netherlands to form the core of the GreenfieldCities.org professional team.</li>
<li>Push the European Union, United Nations and Regional Leadership to think long term and commit to securing small safe havens in or near Middle East conflict zones for at least 50 years ahead. </li>
<li>Develop “Greenfield” cities in the secured areas for at least 250,000 people within 18 months. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We will
     recruit development team members from future citizens. </span>
</li>
<li>Gather funds to invest at least $ 150 million in green infrastructure and support for pioneering Greenfield citizens.</li>

I know it may seem like a far fetched dream, but i truly belive i can make it possible. In order to make it possible, i need the proper training and education. I have been accepted to Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD). A very prestigious performing arts school. Upon completion of my Bachelor of fine arts degree in the performing arts, i will have the training and education needed to pursue my dream career.<br/><br/>The only problem with going is that... I desperately need money! </p>
<p>The tuition for SCAD is a wopping $31,905! With scholarships and Financial aid i have only been able to get around $19,000 paid for. That leaves me with over $12,000 to pay for the rest of tuition and other fees. <br/><br/>Going to SCAD is my dream, and i know that i'm meant to be there. I just need your help to get me there. <br/>If you can, i would highly appreiciate any type of donation. from $1 to $100. Anything and everything will help me <strong>drastically.</strong> <br/><br/>If it comes down to it, i will be selling my car to pay for some of the tuition.

<p>The team competed and successfully won their regional competition with flying colors. They were even awarded a very special award, The Renaissance Award for their technical solution for their problem. This allowed them to move on to the Colorado State Finals, where they competed against other top-rate teams from throughout the state.</p>
<p>The team achieved something none of the members thought possible back on those initial practice days in January and February—they won at state.</p>
<p>Now they are given the very rare opportunity to travel to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville to compete against 90 countries, including the United States at the Destination ImagiNation Global Finals.</p>
<p>The four day event is filled with interactive activities that encourage the students to meet, learn and create with the other finalists from around the world. They will also compete and perform their winning solution against nearly 200 other teams. </p>

Through the Rainforest Awakenings program's holistic approach to environmental protection, meditation, trust building activities and the practice of council we will learn to protect nature and build community. We will share the solutions and community organizations skills we learned in Chicago and put into practice the skills we will learn in Panama when we return. We intend to document and share the struggle of the Panamanian people, the beauty of the land and our transformation as community leaders in order to raise awareness and continue global empowerment. Together we can defend our land.</p>
<p>AFTER WINTESSING… not only the struggle but also the power we have as a community we decided we couldn’t let this opportunity to support our Panamanian earth and community. We find their struggles, culture, and community too similar hold back from reaching out our hand. In Chicago one can see the difference in social and economic statuses change from one block to the next. In Little Village we witness that but also are immersed in the culture. The Little Village community is 83% Latino, half being 1<sup>st</sup> generation immigrants. We are part of that vibrant culture but we are also part of that great struggle. The poverty rate is 27% while Chicago’s overall rate is 20%. We are part of that every day struggle to support ourselves as well as our families, as daughters. We fight to keep our family and community strong. We, as supporters of P.E.R.R.O and LVEJO, have participated in the battles against two main environmental bullies. In Little Village and Pilsen, where we live, we were able to shut down the two of Chicago's biggest coal-fired power plants after 10 years of community protesting. <a href=""http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8562866"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8562866</a> &lt;<a href=""http://lvejo.org/current-events/retire2plants"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://lvejo.org/current-events/retire2plants</a>&gt;</p>
<p> WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET... We have had success leading fundraising campaigns in our neighborhood. Now, we are learning about the power of fundraising on-line. We have applied for scholarships and are hosting fundraisers in our schools and community. It is our hope that you will join our efforts to grow as leaders, build stronger global community and protect the planet.</p>
<p>During this campaign, we are requesting funds to contribute to the remainder of our program costs. These costs cover room and board, 2 meals a day, transportation, guides, and service projects for 3 adults and 4 young women.</p>
<p>7 Travelers x $1143 each = $8001</p>
<p> Check out our unique perks! You will also get information on what is happening in Panama from the Youth perspective and directly from Panamanian people. You can connect with us and follow us on Facebook.</p>
<p>IMPACT... Awareness will be raised about the destruction caused by power plants on a global scale. We will be able to directly connect our local struggles with that of the Panamanian people and understand on a deeper level why the work we do is so important. We will be better informed about root causes of environmental destruction and experience a holistic approach to rainforest preservation. We will be empowered by knowledge and experience and better prepared to speak with other young people about real ways that we can continue to protect the planet. This will be the creation of an alternative model of how to support young leaders as they work to create a healthier planet.</p>
<p>SOCIAL IMPACT... The lives Chicago youth will change forever! They will reap the benefits of your generosity and concern for others. This will have a tremendous positive effect on their self-esteem and will also teach them how to build quality relationships with others and the global community. They will gain heightened leadership skills, advocacy skills, interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, cultural diversity and awareness skills, and have a broadened perspective of the opportunities available to them as they become successful adults. Youth will document there journey and bring that documentary back to their respective communities. Many more young people will be inspired and encouraged by the youth that will benefit from this amazing experience. </p>
<p>8 More reasons why this project is impactful! -</p>
<p>-     Youth will become stronger leaders that will pass the torch to the next generation, which is also known as rites of passage</p>
<p>-     Youth will gain applicable communication and relational skills for college, jobs and entrepreneurial ventures</p>
<p> -    Youth will gain global leadership skills, critical thinking skills, and strategizing skills</p>
<p> -   Youth will experience the healing power of Mother Earth and community</p>
<p>-   Youth will have the opportunity to participate in healing circles to share their experiences and connect with a community that understands and cares</p>
<p> -   Youth will learn about the importance of relying on natural resources versus industrialized resources </p>
<p>-    Youth will understand how social injustice impacts the world and their ability to participate in the creation of a healthier planet.</p>

Through the Rainforest Awakenings program's holistic approach to environmental protection, meditation, trust building activities and the practice of council we will learn to protect nature and build community. We will share the solutions and community organizations skills we learned in Chicago and put into practice the skills we will learn in Panama when we return. We intend to document and share the struggle of the Panamanian people, the beauty of the land and our transformation as community leaders in order to raise awareness and continue global empowerment. Together we can defend our land.
AFTER WINTESSING… not only the struggle but also the power we have as a community we decided we couldn’t let this opportunity to support our Panamanian earth and community. We find their struggles, culture, and community too similar hold back from reaching out our hand. In Chicago one can see the difference in social and economic statuses change from one block to the next. In Little Village we witness that but also are immersed in the culture. The Little Village community is 83% Latino, half being 1st generation immigrants. We are part of that vibrant culture but we are also part of that great struggle.

<h3>Hi, my name is Taylor Boykin. I am a college student in Kansas working toward my Communications degree. I have cerebral palsy but it doesn't have me! I have set many goals for myself: finish school, get a good job, meet that special lady and have a family. One major goal I have is to learn to drive a vehicle so that I don't have to rely on others or the bus system to get me where I want and need to go.  Because I use a power wheelchair and have limited range of motion I must learn to drive a van that will be equipped with EMC (Electronic Mobility Controls) which is a high tech system designed for people with physical limitations.</h3>
<h3>Normally Vocation Rehabilitation covers training for individuals with disabilities but because I am a student and not employed they cannot assist me. The training requires a trainer with the EMC technology skills. Currently the closest one to me is in Ballwin, Mo which is about 4 hours east of me. That means the trainer would have to travel to Kansas where I am located in his specially equipped van to provide me the training. The cost is approximately $8,700.00 which covers the driving instruction for 5 days/40 hours, lodging/meals for instructor, and gas for the specialized van. In addition to this cost is $75.00 per hour of travel time. So that is an additional $600.00. This is a huge amount for me and my family.</h3>
<h3>The impact of your help would allow me to experience the same freedom as my peers. It would provide me another layer of independence that I don't have access to right now. Times are tough right now so any assistance would be greatly appreciated. If you are not in a position to help financially please help me by spreading the word to make others aware of the limited funding there is available for individuals with disabilities.  If I am blessed to raise the money for the driving lessons that would be great! If by some small miracle I was to exceed my goal any additional money would go toward the purchase of a van for me.  Direct contributions can be made to me at P.O. Box 13504, Overland Park, Kansas 66282. Thank you for your time, your prayers, and any contributions.</h3>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Helen Gradstein here. No, this is not the time where you press the back button and keep browsing. This is the time where you hopefully read through this letter, because our program tackles the many difficulties in the education system in third world countries with one unique and efficient program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Exponential Education started two and a half years ago in Ghana, West Africa. Since then, the program has been growing in strength and is currently expanding. The program has run in multiple areas in Ghana, and as you are reading this letter, over 150 students are studying and tutoring twice this week in order to ensure themselves a better future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are three general problems in education in most underdeveloped nations today:</p>
<ol>
<li>Junior High School students are unable to pass the basic entrance exams into High School because of poor educational resources and lack of state funding. Therefore, most students are not able to continue further than a Junior High School level education.</li>
<li>Of the students that pass the entrance exam and enroll themselves in High School, many must drop out of school prematurely due to lack of funding to pay their school fees (about $15 a term).</li>
<li>Of the students that are able to graduate High School, most do not have enough funding to continue on to University.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Exponential Education tackles these three issues in one unique, multiplying program. We take four or five High School students, pay them a small weekly stipend so that they can stay enrolled in school, and in return, they each tutor five Junior High School students. Therefore, five High School students are providing free tutoring to twenty five Junior High School students, helping to bridge the gap in education and creating a greater High School entrance exam pass rate. At the end of ten weeks, the most accomplished High School student tutor receives a scholarship of $300 USD, which could pay for his or her full first year’s University tuition in either Ghana or India.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The crazy thing is that the entire program only costs $500 USD.  This amount provides one High School student a full scholarship for higher education, four High School students receive a weekly stipend to stay enrolled in High School, and twenty five Junior High School students receive free tutoring by older peers in their local area who understand their culture, community and educational needs. In addition, with this sum, Exponential Education provides snacks and materials for every session for those who are unable to afford such basic amenities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Exponential Education has now successfully completed fifteen programs, in ten different schools, and is still running today. Past scholarship winners like Michael Asore, who is now attending University of Ghana and studying Computer Engineering, or Rabiatu Nuhu, who is also attending University of Ghana and studying Anthropology, are continuously making strides to ensure a better future for themselves, their families and their community. Many of the Junior High School students that received extra tutoring from Exponential Education are now enrolled in High School and are the first in their families to receive more advanced education.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As of December 2012, Exponential Education will have provided education to more than seven hundred children and young adults, ensured High School enrollment for over seventy High School Students, and will have provided University Scholarships to over 20 High School student tutors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently, Exponential Education has expanded the program from one location to thirteen locations and have hired Ghanaian community leaders to monitor the programs. We are also trying to further exapnd into the village of Abanase, where an American volunteer ran school, YIST, would like to implement the program as well. Renee Funston and Amber Shevin will be leading these programs, and be helping all the children unable to afford better education in their villages. In addition to our educational goals, Exponential Education creates local employment opportunities and encourages community development primarily through local leaders.</p>
<br/>With 14 locations and two paid Ghanaian program monitors, our estimated budget for the year 2013 will be approximately $14,000 dollars. Eighteen programs per year, provides better education for over 500 kids. That includes about 450 children receiving free tutoring, snacks and materials, 90 High School students who stay enrolled in High School and 18 High School students who receive scholarships worth a year’s tuition to University. Our full time Ghanaian program manager will be paid $900 USD each per term, which is a competitive wage for a part-time job in Ghana (Ghana GDP per capita is approximately $2000 USD a year), and any extra funding will be used towards increased program enrollments, more snacks, more materials, higher wages and additional future programs.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I know that there are so many non-profit organizations out there, and many of you contribute regularly, however your donations are individually meaningful when invested in Exponential Education. These kids are desperate for higher education, and I believe that education within the community is the key to solving regional issues all over the world.  Your donation will make a huge difference in these children’s lives, and not only create better educational foundations, but also increase their confidence, their test scores, introduce community discussion, involvement and empowerment, critical thinking, employment opportunities, increase the local economy, and create new community leaders. This program works, has a successful track record, and can be customized to fit any community and its students’ needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can assure you that your donation sincerely touches the lives of so many students. I can’t express the proud look on our children’s faces when they improve in their math and reading skills over twelve weeks, or the shock that the High School student tutors have when they win their scholarships. If you are interested in seeing what I mean, take a look at some of our kids who have benefited from Exponential Education, with the website provided.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So please, reach into your pockets, or that book that you sometimes hide money in, or even those envelopes with dollars in it that get mailed to you that you are supposed to mail back but never do, and find it in your hearts to donate to this worthy cause. I promise I will not let you down, and I will keep you updated with videos, pictures and statements of how your donations have directly benefited these children through Exponential Education.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone can donate, but if you like our page or put it on your status feed it would be a great help. Spreading the word is always needed! Also, have any ideas? We are always collaborating and taking your suggestions, since, you know, that whole two minds are better then one thing...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, want to intern or come to Ghana? The Exponential Education team will always be taking volunteers or interns. We are open to people coming and helping building, organizing, gaining government support, and helping the students of our programs.</p>
<p>Want to run an Exponential Education program outside of Ghana! Go For it! We will help you fundraise, get all of our materials, and succesfully run a program with our Exponential Education kit. Contact me for more details.</p>

If you are interested in seeing what I mean, take a look at some of our kids who have benefited from Exponential Education, with the website provided.
 
So please, reach into your pockets, or that book that you sometimes hide money in, or even those envelopes with dollars in it that get mailed to you that you are supposed to mail back but never do, and find it in your hearts to donate to this worthy cause. I promise I will not let you down, and I will keep you updated with videos, pictures and statements of how your donations have directly benefited these children through Exponential Education.
 


Other Ways You Can Help
We know that not everyone can donate, but if you like our page or put it on your status feed it would be a great help. Spreading the word is always needed! Also, have any ideas?

<p><b>- Frame-by-Frame animation (bitmap)</b><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/tzGx6f4rBnM"" width=""580""></iframe></div>

<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/371577/files/20140215060546-priorities-2014-2.jpg?1392473146"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/>For
 a donation of fixed amount (see the perks on the right)  we offer to the donor an exceptional privilege to 
choose a priority of development.  So, we will spend next month working on the priority you defined.  Of course, we can't promise <i>any</i> thing, so please select from the list below:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Frame-by-frame bitmap animation support (continued, see <a href=""http://wiki.synfig.org/wiki/Dev:Roadmap/Frame-by-frame_animation_%28bitmap%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">current status</a>)</li>
<li>Rendering speed optimization</li>
<li>Sound support</li>
<li>Improve user interface<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>NOTE: We don't guarantee the feature from a selected priority to be <i>completely</i> <i>finished</i>
 within a month. Such promises are not compatible with development 
realities. What we promise is to dedicate no less than 85% of our 
working time to developing this priority for a full month. Though, one 
month is a  significant period and such dedication would lead to 
significant changes in selected direction. Many our users are aware that
 we used to publish <a href=""http://www.synfig.org/cms/en/download/development"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">development snapshots</a> regularly, so you will be able to benefit from development results as soon as possible.</p><p>EXAMPLE: As result of our earlier fundraising campaign, we got sold the ""Choose priority"" perk for October. The priority chosen by donor was ""Single-window UI"". You can see results in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLzkBuNSCVI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this video</a>.</p><h3>""Development OS"" perk</h3><p>By default we use Linux operation system (OS) for daily development (because we love Linux). As result, the Linux version of Synfig is the most polished, because it goes through daily proof.</p><p>But, for a fixed-amount donation (see the perks on the right) you can make us shift to other OS for next month. So, if we will use the OS of your choice in our daily development, then obviously  the Synfig version will be especially polished to work on it: daily proof =&gt; more testing =&gt; less bugs =&gt; better stability.</p><p>No worries, this perk doesn't mean we drop support for other operation systems. It's just a question of choosing the OS for daily development.<br/><br/>At the moment the only OS available for choice is <b>Windows</b>.</p>
<h3>Other perks</h3>
<p>We understand that there are people who would like to support our efforts by other means.

<p>Hello friends! </p>
<p>When I moved to Armenia, Colombia to begin my professional teaching career I knew there would be great opportunities to learn about community development from a Colombian cultural perspective. At my school I was fortunate enough to meet several like-minded teachers who are active in the local community. One inspiring fellow teacher was helping to found a grassroots organization called Casa Nuestra.  </p>
<p>Casa Nuestra is currently supporting a new school in the rural community of Barcelona Alta (nearby Circasia, Quindio). The organization has created a youth center that houses international volunteers who bring personal talents and expertise to teach youth new skills and ways of life through experiential learning. This provides youth with structured programming throughout the week that helps broaden minds and engage members of the community.  </p>
<p>To date a group of teachers and I have volunteered in several different projects, here are some examples of what we've done so far:</p>
<p>- <strong>Arts and Crafts:</strong> creating a community canvas, music classes, devil sticks from reusable materials (bamboo and old bike tubes).</p>
<p>- <strong>Culinary Classes</strong>: teaching youth about what goes into a recipe and how we get energy from healthy food -- we've cooked pizza from scratch, simple smoothies, and black bean burritos.</p>
<p>- <strong>Physical Education</strong>: we like to introduce different games and activity to teaching about fundamental movement skills and different ways to stay active (i.e. Tai Chi, Soccer, Ultimate Frisbee, proper posture, etc.) </p>
<p>-<strong> Projects</strong>: the latest larger scale project La Casa Nuestra has embarked on is building a playground from sustainable materials such as, bamboo, old tires, tubing, etc. </p>
<p>They've housed other volunteers that have specialized in areas such as agricultural engineering, fine arts, coding, crocheting and plan to welcome many more!</p>
<p>This year I began training for Medellin Maraton De Flores, my second fundraiser marathon (<a href=""http://maratonmedellin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://maratonmedellin.com/</a>) while volunteering at Casa Nuestra. I thought to myself, where can I direct the funds? Where can resources be used most efficiently? I thought Casa Nuestra! Check out their mission statement: </p>
<p>MISSION STATEMENT- Fundacion Futuro con Futuro’s mission is to generate and promote healthy alternatives in vulnerable communities of Colombia.  Based in Barcelona Alta, Quindio the foundation facilitates educational programs that promote sustainable food security, micro-economies, environmental awareness and protection, fitness and team building, natural health care, and community planning. The foundation works directly with the local school system,  and also houses international volunteers that participate in projects. </p>
<p>The school is currently very small and in need of resources to help develop the programs. After meeting with the founders and main volunteers we generated a list of 42 (one for each kilometer of the race) different packages that can be purchased as a donation to the organization. Here is what we came up with: </p>
<p>Hygiene Kit - Hand soap, reusable towels (x10 at $8.30) </p>
<p>School Material Kit - Notebooks, pencils, crayons, posters, scissors, glue (x8 at $12.49)</p>
<p>Art Kit - Paint, brushes, canvas, paper, pencils (x5 at $16.66) </p>
<p>Drum Sticks (x5 at $8.30)</p>
<p>Guitar (x3 at $41.64)</p>
<p>Percussion Instruments (x5 at $33.31)</p>
<p>White Board (x1 at $49.97)</p>
<p>Construction Grade Work Table ($83.29)</p>
<p>1/2 The Cost of a Baking Oven (x2 at $124.93)</p>
<p>Gas Tank (for oven) (x1 at $41.64)</p>
<p>Stainless Steel Table (x1 at $62.46)</p>
<p>Aside from the 5% that Indiegogo charges on the fundraising platform (that I plan to cover) 100% of funds donated to Casa Nuestra will go towards these resources. </p>
<p>This will not only have an impact on the children and workers at the school but will provide a foundation for future generations in this great community! I see this program as a safety net of sorts that will teach the youth how to make healthy choices inside and outside the classroom. I truly believe that a strong community helps people create a meaningful sense of belonging and purpose in life. Supporting my campaign will help develop my skills in community building, allowing me to gain invaluable experience, and help others.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with one of my favourite metaphors,  Indra's Jeweled Net. Imagine Casa Nuestra and the community is supported by a beautiful jewel net. At each juncture in the net there lies a member of the community (a jewel themselves). Each jewel reflects the light of all the other jewels in the community. They are intrinsically connected to all of the others. If one jewel is polished their light becomes stronger and amplified throughout the net. When one is strengthened so becomes the net. I see the light in each of these youth in this community, help make them shine brightly!   </p>
<p>Kind Wishes,</p>
<p>Nicholas Ormond</p>
<p>""Help me to be less fearful of the measure of time, and more fully alive in the time that simply is. Help me to live time, not just to simply use it; to breathe it in, and return it in acts of love and presence.""</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>As a spokesperson for survivors of Complex-PTSD (C-PTSD) it is my passion to be a voice in their darkness. After much contemplation, I have decided, to share my personal battle with Complex-PTSD and my determination to never feel powerless again. Using my story as an example I will be digging deep into the reality of living with this mental illness. I will be sharing how after a victimized childhood, where I suffered overwhelming continuous abuse, I rose from the depths of C-PTSD and rebuilt my life.</p>
<p>Through this book, it is my goal to raise public awareness about the symptoms and complications of C-PTSD and, while it can be a life sentence, it is manageable with help and self-care. I have been on a quest to learn all I can, about how Complex-PTSD took over my life as a child and what can be done to prevent it from happening to others or, at the very least manage its symptoms. It is important to me that I help remove the stigma of mental illness so that the traumatized can feel comfortable to speak freely about their pain.</p>
<p>Included in this book will be an educational component where I will bring together my personal experience with C-PTSD with my background in social work and victimology education as well as my victim services training to include several resources. Some of these resources will include: the signs and symptoms of Complex-PTSD; the Children’s Aid Societies’ Duty to Report; the domestic violence Power and Control Wheel; a list of rooms in your home to stay clear of during domestic violence and why; the symptoms of strangulation and the importance of getting immediate help; and insights into pets as victims of domestic violence. </p>
<p>By providing these resources and insights, victims, their friends and loved ones, frontline workers, the mainstream public, and whomever would like to be informed, can help and better understand where survivors are coming from. Your generous support will help make this happen.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>My campaign-funding goal is $30,000.00. This amount will cover expenses for me to send the manuscript of this book off to be edited (takes approximately 3-4 months to complete), and afterwards published, marketed, and distributed. This funding amount will also include promotion costs and travel and accommodation when required.</p>
<p>I have done my due diligence and to make sure that this book is taken seriously and receives the credibility it deserves, I have made the decision to have the manuscript of this book professionally edited and published.</p>
<p>Where expenses are concerned: publishers no longer have big budgets to give their new writer’s advances. As such, it is their expectation, that with their guidance, I will do the promotion and marketing of this book on my own time and at my own expense. It is common practice for publishing companies to only start paying out royalties after nine months to one year after the book is published. After that the royalties are paid on a quarterly basis, which means a new writer can wait a long time before they see any financial compensation for their work, especially at the beginning of the promotion and marketing stage. Also, Indiegogo charges a percentage for their Crowdfunding services and the credit card companies do as well for processing the payments.</p>
<p>After I receive the campaign funding, the tax person will eventually cometh and I will be taxed for the funds in the year that I receive them. I will be expected to provide a detailed accounting of where the monies have been spent.</p>
<p>To thank you for backing my campaign, I have put together “Perks” for each of my supporters. To show my gratitude I will be acknowledging each of and every one of you through listing your names as a contributor who has helped me make the reality of this book happen.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your generous contributions will be helping bring insight into the reality of children who have developed Complex-PTSD and the toll it can take on their mental health. And how the symptoms can spill over and haunt their adult years. You will be letting survivors know they are not alone, and there is hope for healing and having the life they wish for. This book will open doors to help me get the message across.</p>
<p>To help make this happen, I will be designing a launch strategy for when the book comes hot off the presses. I will be throwing a book launch networking party (you’re all invited) to create awareness, and generate excitement. So that this book doesn’t end up collecting dust on the bookstore shelves, waiting for someone to show up to purchase it, I will be spending a great deal of my time and effort personally promoting and marketing the book to target audiences who can benefit from it most. I will be keeping the buzz going any way I can, including attending networking events and conferences.</p>
<p>I am committed to making this book about Complex-PTSD a success and will be reaching out to bookstores, front-line workers, colleges and universities, my social media platforms, as well as setting up a website, writing blogs and articles for promotion, and sending out press releases. I will be continuously building networking relationships so that I eventually have a fan base, which will help promote the book on my behalf.</p>
<p>I am committed to raising awareness about Complex-PTSD and helping those who have developed it to find their way to healing and your support can help make this happen.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Some of the challenges I expect to encounter and will work diligently to get past, will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Branding and marketing myself</li>
<li>Knocking down barriers</li>
<li>Making myself a household name</li>
<li>Becoming the ""expert"" for those seeking knowledge, assistance, and support</li>
<li>Creating and understanding that there is definitely a difference between PTSD (triggered by a one time event) and Complex-PTSD (occurs after long-term chronic, repeated trauma) and the impact it can have on the victim</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I am completely dedicated to speaking out about the reality of dealing with Complex-PTSD, I am determined to meet the challenges of promoting this book. It is my wish to have this book become the go to choice for anyone wanting to be enlightened about the ""complexities"" of Complex-PTSD.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>It would be greatly appreciated, if you would help make some noise about this campaign by getting the word out to your contacts and social media platforms. Thanks a bunch! P.S. Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools.</p>

Risks & Challenges
Some of the challenges I expect to encounter and will work diligently to get past, will be:

Branding and marketing myself
Knocking down barriers
Making myself a household name
Becoming the ""expert"" for those seeking knowledge, assistance, and support
Creating and understanding that there is definitely a difference between PTSD (triggered by a one time event) and Complex-PTSD (occurs after long-term chronic, repeated trauma) and the impact it can have on the victim

Since I am completely dedicated to speaking out about the reality of dealing with Complex-PTSD, I am determined to meet the challenges of promoting this book. It is my wish to have this book become the go to choice for anyone wanting to be enlightened about the ""complexities"" of Complex-PTSD.

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>The NYU Voice Center is a world leader in patient care, education, and research regarding disorders of voice, swallowing, and airway disorders. In this collaboration with our friends at <a href=""http://www.fitforbroadway.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fit for Broadway</a>, we seek to empower singers to see themselves as vocal athletes, and ultimately, destigmatize vocal recovery. Many singers experience shame or guilt due to injury, or simply symptoms of overuse due to strenuous vocal demand. </p>
<p>Through this collaboration, we are thrilled to offer a limited edition “I’m on Vocal Rest” shirt created by <a href=""https://fitforbroadwayapparel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fit for Broadway Apparel</a> to support this initiative.

<h2>Children deserve to be heard.</h2>
<p><strong><i>What if there was a way we could help children.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>What if we can help children to better express themselves? </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>And better express their emotional needs?</i></strong></p>
<p>I’m Tina Bangel and I am a vocal coach, singer/songwriter and founder of One Voice School of Singing. Over the past 2 decades, working closely with the talented and wonderful kids of One Voice, I’ve come to learn and understand the power of singing. It brings confidence to a shy child, it lifts the spirit and taps into their soul.</p>

<p>Singing helps kids deal with everyday situations. It’s also a way to help express themselves and also a way to help deal with their emotions.</p>

<h3><i>Project Be Heard aims to bring awareness that music can be a powerful tool to help change children’s lives.</i></h3>
<p>We need to raise $2000 to fund our project Be Heard film clip with an aim to inspire more children to not be afraid to be expressive and sing out.  We aim to launch the clip world wide and during our 2016 end of year concert.</p>
<h3>
<i><strong>But really, we want to do more than make our film clip. We want to raise funds to help kids impacted by trauma</strong></i>.</h3>
<p>Emotional expression through music can be so beneficial in kids’ lives, but can be really challenging, especially for children who have gone through trauma. </p>
<p>Childhood trauma can have lifelong impacts. In Australian communities, childhood trauma can be linked to mental illness, homelessness, drug and alcohol dependencies, broken relationships or unemployment.</p>

Hi I’m Joy, Founder of Zamrize. As a technologist with a computer science degree from Georgia Tech, I have a unique opportunity as a Fulbright Fellow to spend seven months in Zambia to establish an Integrative Computational Experience (ICE) Lab to empower Zambian youth to become creators of technology. 
In partnership with local organizations, Zamrize will provide support, training and hands-on expertise to help accelerate impact projects and promote social entrepreneurship. 
I would like to extend a global invitation to help us launch this innovative pilot program. 
Through Zamrize, your support of the ICE Lab will ensure diverse participation in the new technology economy by providing a curriculum and hands-on learning lab focused on three foundational elements: Exposure, Education & Entrepreneurship. 
 

 
WHY ZAMBIA?
The prolific adoption of mobile and communications technology across Africa spurred by economic growth on a continent that holds claim to half of the fastest 20 growing economies in the world (including Zambia) —  has not been matched by a labor market equipped to participate in emerging knowledge based economies. 
Zambia is ripe for an entrepreneurial awakening —  with a growing population of talented, smart, resourceful innovators in need of additional resources & training. 
YOUR SUPPORT ESTABLISHES ICE LAB 
With your help we will implement the next phase of Zamrize targeting 20 students, who will learn web and mobile development skills along with entrepreneurial thinking through impact projects like WRAPP that address local challenges.
10K GOAL
Your support will provide equipment for the lab, including:


Laptops


Smartphones


Tablets

along with:


Curriculum Materials and Development


Transportation for Participants
Further funding will help support the integration of impact projects to promote the creation of accessible digital content for education, health and agriculture.
 
REWARDS
Zamrize Perks are about empowering YOU to turn your ideas into reality while supporting the establishment of the ICE Lab.      

 
WHY SUPPORT ZAMRIZE?
SHORT TERM IMPACT


Trained entrepreneurial software developers earning money



Replicable curriculum for teaching entrepreneurial thinking and web/mobile development


Relevant applications/digital content available to Zambians.
LONG TERM IMPACT


In country capacity to fulfill currently outsourced software development jobs from local companies


Greater visibility of Africans in technology fields


Increased female participation in technology fields

Establishment of a robust digital distribution platform will deliver content relevant in language and context to growing number of plugged in Zambians
 
IMPACT PROJECT: WRAPP  
 
As the first impact outcome of the ICE Lab Method from March - April 2013, Zamrize facilitated the creation of WRAPP — Zambia's groundbreaking Women's Rights Application.


 
Mobile web version of the application is available here: http://zamrize.org/wrapp
 
 

""Fantastic App, Eye Opening, Empowering"" - Merrick Furst
 
 
IMPACT PROJECTS PIPELINE
 
The Zamrize ICE Lab focuses on motivating learning with impact projects that create value for the local community. 
 
Current Pipeline
 


iSchool: Educational Content 


iHealth: Essential well-being and medical information


iFarm: Local horticulture and animal husbandry methods


Tourism: Promoting culture, incredible landscapes, and wildlife for economic growth
 


 

 
iSchool is revolutionizing education in Zambia by:
 


digitizing the entire Zambia school curriculum grades 1-7 in 8 languages 


providing necessary teacher training


leveraging lessons learned from a 2.5 year pilot with 2,500 students


pioneering the zedupad tablet to deliver content


 


The digitization of lessons is currently being done overseas given a lack of local capacity. iSchool is willing to use local developers if reliable capacity can be established in country and is partnering with Zamrize to use ICE Lab to do a feaibility test. iSchool Integration will build on lessons learned from the WRAPP experience and has been identified as a partner that could also provide a physical home for the Zamrize ICE Lab in a new teacher training facility being planned.  www.ischool.zm

Help <em>both boys and girls</em>, to become interested in flight and open to them the possibility of becoming pilots! The funds for this particular campaign will be used to provide 10 teens their very own Pilot's License. Any excess funding received will go towards the flight club obtaining aircraft and other tools necessary to help the flight club attain their goals. Future campaigns will call for purchasing small aircraft for these clubs. The more you give, the more that can be accomplished!</p>

<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>The cost of obtaining a pilot license averages from $7,000 to $10,000 and is contantly rising. We need $80,000 to help 10 teens fulfill their dreams of flying and kick start their careers; like <span>Amelia Earhart who followed her dream of flying and pioneered the future of flying freedom. T</span>he teens selected are established by the <em>Kingfisher Flight Club</em> members themselves in an unbiased and equal opportunity bases.</p>
<p>Plus! Any excess funding will go toward inspiring kids of all ages, both <em>boys and girls</em>, to become interested in flight. </p>
<p>SHORTAGE OF PILOTS: In the United States there is and will continue to be a shortage of pilots. At times some US airlines have used European and South American pilots to fill the gap. Inspiring kids now to become pilots will help ensure the <em>Future of Flying Freedom</em> for all.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this program is <em>not just pie in the sky (excuse the pun)</em>, but rather a proven method that has become self sustaining through the kids own enthusiasm. The working model of success is proven via the first club of it's kind, the <em><strong>Kingfisher Flight Club</strong></em>, and has a signup roll of over 100 members. We will take this model of success and replicate it in many other communities.</p>
<p><img alt=""Kids on Flight Simulator"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://googledrive.com/host/0B1wHY-DlifJrRlh1bnowZTVoLUE/IMG_3419r.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px 8px;"" title=""Kids on Flight Simulator""/>The idea began when the Kingfisher Library in rural Oklahoma sponsored a Flight Simulator for use by kids and teenagers. The idea caught on quickly! So we started a new club and called it the <strong><em>Kingfisher Flight Club</em></strong>. The Library supplied the computers and software needed to keep the club operating. Now over 100 kids have signed up for and benefited from this grass roots program. </p>
<p>Since then Michael R. Tautkus, Director of the Library has organized two separate flight days in which volunteer pilots from the surrounding areas belonging to the EAA Young Eagles program flew into Kingfisher, Oklahoma and enabled over 70 kids from the community to experience small aircraft flights for the first time.</p>
<p><img alt=""Flight Day in Kingfisher"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://googledrive.com/host/0B1wHY-DlifJrRlh1bnowZTVoLUE/IMG_1051rc2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px 8px;"" title=""Flight Day in Kingfisher""/>Recognizing how the club had helped to provide focus in the lives of teens, teaching them to interact with others, become responsible and develop leadership skills along with many technical skills inspired Tautkus to create the same types of programs around the United States and in other lands. Tautkus is planning to promote these types of programs in other libraries and schools.</p>
<p><img alt=""Happy Flyer!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://googledrive.com/host/0B1wHY-DlifJrRlh1bnowZTVoLUE/IMG_1075r.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px 8px;"" title=""Happy Flyer!""/>""Today kids and especially teenagers do not have the focus they need in their lives and many become lost to bad influences."", Tautkus said, ""This usually starts when kids are in middle school."" Providing funding for this project will help kick start other programs geared toward helping these ones find the focus in their lives that will inspire them to become responsible adults. The scope of this program may extend to kids all over the United States and the World if successful. We will depend upon our contributors to provide the funding needed for 10 pilots licenses but additionally excess and will help us evaluate the prospect of moving this program forward into other areas.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute much financially, please tell your local pilots, educators, veterans and others who would be interested to contribute a dollar, 5 dollars, 10 dollars or more. Make as much noise about this as possible. Remember this is not just ""pie in the sky"", but rather a proven method with a working club of over 100 members.</p>
<p>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools to help you get the word out!</p>

We will take this model of success and replicate it in many other communities.
The idea began when the Kingfisher Library in rural Oklahoma sponsored a Flight Simulator for use by kids and teenagers. The idea caught on quickly! So we started a new club and called it the Kingfisher Flight Club. The Library supplied the computers and software needed to keep the club operating. Now over 100 kids have signed up for and benefited from this grass roots program. 
Since then Michael R. Tautkus, Director of the Library has organized two separate flight days in which volunteer pilots from the surrounding areas belonging to the EAA Young Eagles program flew into Kingfisher, Oklahoma and enabled over 70 kids from the community to experience small aircraft flights for the first time.
Recognizing how the club had helped to provide focus in the lives of teens, teaching them to interact with others, become responsible and develop leadership skills along with many technical skills inspired Tautkus to create the same types of programs around the United States and in other lands. Tautkus is planning to promote these types of programs in other libraries and schools.
""Today kids and especially teenagers do not have the focus they need in their lives and many become lost to bad influences."", Tautkus said, ""This usually starts when kids are in middle school."" Providing funding for this project will help kick start other programs geared toward helping these ones find the focus in their lives that will inspire them to become responsible adults. The scope of this program may extend to kids all over the United States and the World if successful. We will depend upon our contributors to provide the funding needed for 10 pilots licenses but additionally excess and will help us evaluate the prospect of moving this program forward into other areas.
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't contribute much financially, please tell your local pilots, educators, veterans and others who would be interested to contribute a dollar, 5 dollars, 10 dollars or more. Make as much noise about this as possible. Remember this is not just ""pie in the sky"", but rather a proven method with a working club of over 100 members.
Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools to help you get the word out!

<h3><strong>Students want clean air for their school:  </strong></h3>
<p>When students in the Roosevelt Science Club became aware that the air quality around Roosevelt High School was ranked in the lowest 1% amongst schools in the nation they began studying potential solutions.  They discovered that by combining mechanical science with biological science it is possible to <strong>recycle polluted air into clean air</strong>.  To test their hypothesis students will place special NASA designed planters containing plants in 3 test rooms. They will collect before and after air samples that will help them determine the effectiveness of their project.</p>
<p>Roosevelt science teacher Kendall Jensen is teaming up with Ron Pate (the director of the Second Stories Good SO2lutions initiative) and Kassie Ridley from Portland State University's Department of Environmental Science to assist students on this project. Each believes that releasing students to apply knowledge to real-world situations multiplies the value of their education and also affirms them as valuable contributors to the well-being of their school and neighborhood. Many of these students and/or their family members struggle with conditions that are caused by bad air quality. <strong>Nothing could be more vital to making knowledge count than affording this kind of real world applied education opportunity for students.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>The health impacts:</strong></h3>
<p>A USA Today study constructed with U.S. EPA data in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University places Roosevelt in the ""worst"" category for cancer causing pollutants and overall chemical toxicity. Even more alarming is that indoor air is typically  from 10 to 100 times worse than surrounding outdoor air. The EPA reports that poor indoor air quality is one of the top 5 threats to human health. In addition, Roosevelt has no air filtering system.</p>
<p>The USA Today report listed dangerous levels of manganese in the air surrounding Roosevelt. Manganese is known to damage the neurological system and cause behavioral problems. There are other dangerous volatile organic compounds (VOC) that aren’t covered in the report. As such, this project can shed valuable light on what is in the air, as well as inform strategies for improving indoor air quality.</p>
<p>The plant and planter installations that are being used in this study have provided significantly cleaner air in related projects, producing a variety of benefits such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduction of eye irritations and headaches</li>
<li>reduction of respiratory ailments</li>
<li>decrease in stress</li>
<li>increase in blood oxygen levels by as much as 1%.</li>
<li>enhanced productivity and creativity</li>
</ul>
<p>When a Sierra Club chapter learned that the FEMA trailers that were used after hurricane Katrina contained dangerous levels of formaldehyde, they placed one of the NASA-designed planters inside to test how well it worked at eradicating the formaldehyde. The lab test revealed that the planter had reduced formaldehyde levels by more than 85% -- a level deemed safe. (Wolverton)</p>
<p><strong>Air Testing</strong>: The gold standard and most sensitive (and expensive) testing is done by a lab that performs gas chromatograph mass spectometry analysis of air samples, which is briefly shown in the video.  This testing will provide vital information about the existing air quality, as well as measure the effectiveness of the 3 installations in the 3 test rooms.  This is chapter one of the story of air at Roosevelt -- finding out what the students are up against, and finding out what can be effective in their battle for clean air.  With evidence, students would be able to apply for grants to extend the benefits to the rest of the school -- which would help ensure a good ending to this story.      </p>
<h3><strong>We need $12,000 to make this project happen!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>$6,000 pays for air quality equipment, testing, and analysis reports</li>
<li>$1,000 pays for NASA planters, plants and related materials</li>
<li>$2,000 pays administration fees and the Indie GoGo campaign</li>
<li>The remainder is spread across expenses for: a field trip; refreshments; and a small stipend for project direction</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How it works:</strong></h3>
<p>The students will place a NASA designed planter with a plant (snake plant) in each of 3 test rooms. where before and after air samples will be compared.</p>
<p><strong>The planter</strong> utilizes aqua culture with a porous media and activated carbon. A fan inside the planter pulls air from the room down through the plant media filtering system, where it then propels<strong> clean air into the room at a rate of 23 cubic feet a minute</strong>. The pollutants are captured by the activated carbon where microbes transform it into plant food, which nourishes the plant that releases additional clean oxygen into the air. The video shows a simple illustration of the planter. The plant, microbes, activated carbon, porous media and fan all work in concert to create an efficient air recycling loop system where the activated carbon never has to be replaced.      </p>
<h3><strong>If we come up short of the desired $12,000:</strong></h3>
<p>We will scale the project down -- specifically, we will use less expensive means of testing the air quality. Any money exceeding the $12,000 will be put in the Roosevelt Science Club to build on the results of this study, such as placing additional planters in other classrooms.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Our names are<b> Kameron, Simon, Katie, Miriam, Nohea, and Emily.</b> We are an international motley crew who all also happen to be friends and teachers of English in Hyogo, Japan!

<p> </p>
<h3 class=""western"">This Campaign is for YOU.</h3>
<p>When I first was introduced to Neville, there wasn't much available in the way of lectures or audios or even the pdf lectures. None of his books had been narrated and the lectures that were available were very expensive to buy.</p>

<p>Having already narrated a number of Neville's audio books this will <strong>complete the collection</strong> and provide the most comprehensive Neville resource for all of us to In-Joy!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>And, it is much more than that...</strong></h3>
<p>Whilst in the recording studio I will be producing some <em>guided audios with specific processes</em> that will help you to get the most out of Neville's teachings.</p>
 </div>
<div>
<h3>Here is how you can help:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This project will run over approximately a 6 month period as there is a lot of work to do. </p>
<ul>
<li>I have outlined some approximate time frames below on this page for the recording and editing process.</li>
<li>What is required is some new equipment, outlined below and to cover the costs of the recording studio time. </li>
<li>When we exceed the target amount additional funds will be used to record more of the trainings to help you get more out of using your wonderful imagination.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Awesome Perks for YOU so you can Benefit Immediately!</h3>
<p>Perks by the way are <strong>the gifts that you receive</strong> when you sponsor a campaign on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>And I wanted to make especially sure that you absolutely love the perks that I have prepared for you.</p>
<p>You can fund this campaign <strong>by selecting a perk on the top righthand side of this web page where it says ""Perks For YOur Contribution""</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>NEW EQUIPMENT - Here are the details of what your funding will be used for:</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>New Audio Recording equipment.</strong> This is so that I can make higher quality audios. (Estimate $400)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>New laptop with good specs</strong> for recording the audios and faster editing of the audios and the videos. (Ideally a Mac as they are excellent for multimedia) (Estimate $900)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Recording studio time</strong> which is less expensive when i use my own recording equipment. What is being paid for here is a ""background-noise-free zone"" where I can record using this equipment. (Estimate $500)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>New HD video camera with external mic plug and wireless mic.</strong> This will be used for the training videos. (Estimate $400)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>New external hard drive</strong> for backing up the audio files (Estimate $100)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>ABUNDANCE ADVENTURES.</strong> This is THE comprehensive and on-going course that I have been working on for the last year.</li>

<p> </p>
<h3>Recording and Editing Time Estimates</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Based on previous experience I can record during a 2-3 hours period in a day and can narrate 7 to 10 ""A4"" pages in each session.  (includes breaks I take to read through the material multiple times before narrating each section.) Allow extra time to and from studio.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Editing time can vary depending on the flow of the actual recording. It usually takes around 1.5 plus hours to go through and edit a 1 hour recording. The time depends on how accurate I was in my narration of each paragraph.</p>

These are estimates. I won't know exactly how long this will take until I am in the flow on the project.
 
The Finished New Neville Recordings
 

As I work through the list of books and narrate and edit them I will make them available to you on MP3.

I will keep you posted via the Indiegogo campaign management.

I will also create a CD version that is available in the perks and later via the web site.

REMEMBER: All of the ""current"" Neville audio recordings and original lectures are available to you NOW via the ""perks"" when you fund this wonderful campaign.
 


The Impact Your Funding Will Have
Neville's teachings helps change lives!
 
Over 60% of the visitors to my Neville site are new visitors which means that Neville's works continue to reach and inspire new students.
Your contribution to this campaign helps not only make more of Neville's works available in more media formats but also for me to help share what I have learned over the years in practicing those techniques.
As a a learning medium audio is so powerful and multiple listenings to the books exposes students to a ever deeper understanding of the material.
Audio and video are by far the most popular way that people have for learning these days and anything that helps people to learn more efficiently and enjoyably is certainly a good thing.
I hope that my time invested in creating these audios for you enhances and multiplies your experience when you invest your time into learning.

<h3>Who Am I? What Am I Doing?</h3>
<p>Hello Beautiful People! </p>
<p>My name is Meg and I am 23 year old Bible college graduate. I currently live in Los Angeles but I grew up in the woods of Maine. I made the 3,000 mile trek from Maine to California to attend Life Pacific College in 2009 and have been here every since. </p>
<p>My decision to attend Bible college has forever changed the course of my life! At the end of my Sophomore year my college rolled out a brand new opportunity for students, study abroad! I immediately jumped at the opportunity, was the very first to apply for the trip and a few short months later I was on a plane with 11 of my peers heading to Israel where we spent three months exploring the land where Jesus himself walked! To say that the Land and the people of the Middle East captured my heart is an understatement. </p>
<p>Now, being a graduate and having traveled to the Middle East on two separate occasions I have been given the opportunity to return once again! This time I will be leading a group of 8 students, supervising and coordinating their time in Turkey. </p>
<p>My life was completely changed when I studied abroad as a student and I now have the privilege to lead students in the same opportunity I had! My passion and desire is two fold; one, to see students hearts and minds transformed by the community of study abroad and two, to see the Middle East won for Jesus. I have a passion for both! I desperately want to lead, disciple, and train a generation to seek after Jesus, living in community, learning what it means to really love Jesus and in turn, loving one another. I also desperately want to see hearts all over the world turn to Jesus, but I have a specific passion for the people of the Middle East, a diverse, colorful, beautiful people, who need to see the love of Jesus! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here is what I need your help with - getting me there! I need money, plain and simple. </p>
<p>The trip will cost about $5,000 for the entire three months. This includes the cost of </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Travel/transportation </li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Housing    </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>It may seem like a pretty big chunk of change but for three months that's a pretty good deal! What this amount doesn't include are my bills that still need to be accounted and payed for while I am gone such as, phone bill &amp; student loans (recent college grad). So I need all the help I can get! </p>
<p>So why should you give me money? Well, we are the body of Christ, hand and feet extend all over the world and we have been commissioned to love God, love people, and make disciples. Some people were called to go all over the world (me), some people have been give the amazing ability to support, fund and pray for those who go! So there's one answer! Be the hands and feet! </p>
<p>Another reason as to why you should help me...each of my contributors will receive a unique gift from the Middle East upon my return along with an update of my time oversees! Who doesn't want a cool gift from half way across the world?!</p>
<p>Every little bit helps and I am so grateful for each of your prayers and support in making my dreams come true and helping me and the body of Christ advance the kingdom by training and discipling a generation to love in its purest form!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that it's not always possible to contribute finacaially but that doesn't mean you can't help me! Spread the word! Share this link of your Facebook or twitter! </p>
<p>I would also encourage you to do some research and learn a little bit about what's going on in the Middle East and learn how you can love the people just by being educated! </p>

<p>I have been given the opportunity to go to India from January 3 to March 1, 2014 in a service learning project with CFHI (Child Family Health International)! The first month will be spent in New Delhi, the capital of India. The second month will be spent in clinical rotations in different hospitals and clinics in Mumbai, focusing on confronting the challenges of tropical diseases. The final 20 days, I will stay in Mumbai and hopefully be able to help out in an orphanage and a home for women who were rescued from human trafficking.</p>
<p>I believe in social justice. There are parts of the world that are extremely underserved and India is one of those parts of the world. I hope to one day be a physician in an underserved community, and this opportunity to learn about the health care system in India will help me be a more effective advocate of global healthcare in the future.</p>
<p>I will be forever grateful for your help, support, and prayers! By helping me raise the funds to go on this service learning project, you are serving the people of India by promoting social justice and equality! :-)<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>How much I need to raise</h3>
<p>$4500 is needed for this awesome opportunity to volunteer my services in clinics, gain insight on global health, and immerse myself in a different culture. This fee that is paid directly to CFHI is used for the community clinics, medical instruments used in these clinics, community building projects, and my housing and meals for the time I am there.</p>

<li>I have joined this year a non profit organization called <b>Become</b>, which does volunteer work in Haiti, Central America, Kenya and other places in Africa. My name is Maya Odeh, 22 years old Palestinian living in Haifa-Israel . currently finishing my bachelor degree in international relations and preparing to travel to Kenya :)<br/><br/><strong>Become</strong> supports children, families and 
communities in developing countries to overcome poverty and injustice.

last summer with Become, to rebuild a clinic, and facilitate a number 
of community health awareness raising initiatives facilitated by medical
 experts from our team and Sylvia, Abba's co-director (another organization we will be working woth in kenya) and resident 
nurse. Rebuilding the clinic has enabled it to reach the next step in receiving certification with the Kenyan Ministry of Health, a critical 
step in providing top quality health care to a region with few medical 
resources, as well as to increase the traffic in the clinic bringing 
more income into supporting the orphans at Abba</ul>

Business. Prayer.       January is just around the corner, so open your hearts and let love in! Read on to find out how to help!BackgroundI am a businessman who follows Jesus Christ. I have a “regular job” helping businesses grow, but my passion is leading trips of business people to Bukavu in eastern DR Congo.  On each trip, we take French and Swahili Bibles in the form of solar powered MP3 players.  Why?  Because we know from personal experience that the Word of God changes hearts, provides hope and promotes justice. We are gearing up for another trip! People in Bukavu need to know the Word of God.    They need change.  Despite abundant natural resources, they live in one of the poorest and most violent regions of the world.  Accordingly, many have a fatalistic worldview.  Fatalism says that there is nothing I can do about my circumstances so there is no reason to try to create change.  It also says that God is irrelevant to my condition.The Word of God presents a different worldview.     What We NeedWe ask people to sponsor a French/Swahili Bible (a solar powered MP3 player).You can sponsor a Bible by doing one or more of the following:
agreeing to PRAY for the recipient of the Bible and his/her ""listening group""  (just email greg@CongoBlessings.org)
contributing $30 to cover the cost of the Bible
contributing additional money to cover the other costs of the trip
         Purpose of TripsOn each trip, the team develops ongoing relationships with Congolese people while
distributing Bibles and training the recipients to form groups of friends to listen to and discuss the Bible at least one time per week
training Congolese Christians to start and grow businesses that can employ other people
training people to pray
