<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Seven years ago I got on a plane and took a trip to see a run down, boarded up Victorian hotel that had sat empty for a number of years. It overlooked the ocean in a small fishing community on the south shore of Nova Scotia. I knew it had to be restored. I knew I had to do it, so I bought it.</p>
<p>For several years I travelled back and forth from my home and job in Ontario trying to work on it as much as I could and making plans to one day open the doors again to visitors from around the world who wanted a comfortable, welcoming place to visit and enjoy. </p>
<p>In the fall of 2017 I unexpectedly lost my job. I was devastated. Within 3 days I had packed up my car and started driving east to make the hotel home and make my dream a reality.</p>
<p>It has been a struggle but I am creating my dream. When I first moved in I had no running water, no toilet, no bathtub, no heat. I drew water from my well  and used a bucket. Not very glamorous or easy.  Over the last year I have had plumbing added to the building and some of the electrical replaced. I have also fully gutted the first floor and part of the second. Added insulation to the walls and with some help the floors and the original tin ceilings have been restored. </p>
<p>I was able to hire a carpenter and have a beautiful ramp added to the front entrance that will allow everybody access to the building with ease. During this work the rotted beam and structure under the front door was replaced with a new sill and beam to allow people to enter for the next 100 years. A parking lot was also excavated in the back to open the space for lots of cars to park. </p>
<p>I still need signifigant funding to finish this project but from the start I have relied on a simple mantra that continues to motivate me and be able to focus on and create the progress that you can see has happened over the last year.</p>
<p>One room at a time.</p>
<p>Although I don't take this literally it has come to represent the mind set that I focus on what is in front of me. What do I need to do next? What do I need to do today? That is what keeps things happening and eventually it will happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Right now I need funding.</h3>
<p>It can't be escaped. This project needs funding. I am so grateful for and have been blessed with so much help and support so far by wonderful people who believe it can be done. I am now able to run a small business out of the building selling my home made preserves and soap as well as teaching workshops on soap making. This is creating some income which ultimately goes right back into the bigger project. I am looking forward to this expanding in the coming months with the addition of other artisans bringing me their products to sell for them to locals and travelers coming through this season. </p>
<p>The funds I receive from this campaign will be used to help complete the renovations to the second floor to open up the Air BnB rooms. These rooms will provide me with a year round income accommodating both tourists on the lighthouse route and workers who need housing during the lobster season. Those renovations will be to complete 3 guest rooms with 2 full shared bathrooms. </p>
<p>With your help I know this can be done. There are so many ways to help. There is the obvious method of making a donation but if you can't do that there are others ways too. You can share this campaign on your facebook and with your friends. If you wanted to hold a fundraising event that would work too. Maybe a bake sale or garage sale and donate the proceeds. Everything little bit helps. </p>
<p>Please check out my perks. There might be something that catches your fancy and its a double win for both of us.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story. </p>

<strong>Support </strong><strong>Community Housing Capital’s “Homes for Good” Campaign</strong>
</h2>
<p>Studies have shown that family and community stability, economic growth, and positive social change are proven outcomes of high-quality, affordable homeownership and rental housing.</p>
<p>CHC’s “Homes for Good” campaign supports the development and financing of affordable housing for working people in communities across the U.S.  We do this by lending money to nonprofit community development organizations that are members of the national NeighborWorks<sup>®</sup> network. These organizations use the funds to build or rehabilitate housing for people who work hard but may not have access to quality housing that they can afford – people like firefighters, nurses, veterans, teachers, small business owners and others.</p>
<h3><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p><strong>It’s up to you! Be a part of this creative effort to ensure that we continue to meet the basic human need of decent, stable housing for all.</strong></p>
<p>Support for affordable housing has declined in recent years, and everybody knows someone who has struggled to find a good place to live that’s affordable.  The timing is perfect for your gift to make a difference in the lives of families and the future of communities. <strong>Your contribution is tax deductible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your dollar is like a magnet, and it immediately attracts $4 from our other investors.  Help us raise $100,000, and together we can provide half a million dollars to finance great housing solutions that are affordable for people like Connie, Kyle and Eric, whose stories are featured in our video. </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""CHC Contribution Diagram"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.communityhousingcapital.org/images/Diagram8-dr-450x457.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""CHC Contribution Diagram""/></strong></p>
<p>The benefits of your contribution will extend beyond these individual families.  Affordable housing helps the whole community.  Stable housing promotes greater community involvement, educational achievement, lower crime, better property maintenance, and even better health.  And housing creates investment in local economies. It creates jobs, attracts new employers and skilled workers, and it increases revenue for cities and states.</p>
<p>Help us reach our goal by year's end to make a real difference in the lives of hard-working people across the country. When the “crowd” comes together, we can accomplish change that none of us could achieve alone.</p>
<h3><strong>About Community Housing Capital</strong></h3>
<p>CHC has a proven 12-year record for making sound investments that increase access to affordable housing. This year, we’re on track to provide housing for many more families nationwide. Your contribution allows you to be part of this movement.</p>
<p>CHC promotes affordable housing by lending money to nonprofit community development organizations across the country.  These loans provide the flexibility required to fund the development of affordable rental housing and homes to be purchased by modest-income individuals and families. In our first 12 years of operation, we and our community development partners have financed 9,000 units of affordable housing nationwide, which equates to a billion dollars invested in community redevelopment.</p>
<p>The local NeighborWorks organizations working with CHC have a national reputation for strengthening communities through affordable housing and providing economic opportunities.  These organizations also educate residents about their responsibilities as homeowners or renters. Many provide additional services such as computer labs, after-school programs, budgeting skills, energy conservation and more, to take a holistic approach to community development.</p></div>","Support Community Housing Capital’s “Homes for Good” Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>As San Francisco rents have skyrocketed, long time mom and pop shops have closed their doors, working class families have been pushed out of our barrios, and everyday workers have had first-hand experiences of exploitation. </p>
<p>We are eight talented and passionate immigrant leaders that have come out of these struggles to build a community-inspired worker owned catering and restaurant cooperative.  Our group's decision to pool our talents came fresh from late-night action team meetings, weekend skill shares, collective sharing of recipes and food traditions, and organizing alongside PODER (<em>People Organizing to Demand Environmental &amp; Economic Rights</em>).</p>
<p>We are Enrique, Maria, Leny, Juan, Rosy, Alex, Max, and Sofia.  Through sheer passion, collective organizing and community will, we are emerging from the hardship and economic struggle to help create an economy in the hands of the people.</p>
<p>Together we have created a powerful vision that builds community, creates neighborhood assets, preserves traditions, puts decision making power in the hands of local residents, and serves as an inspiration to immigrant-led movements fighting displacement in their working class barrios.</p>
</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

The money raised will pay for site renovations, permits, start up costs, and supporting members while cooking, developing an enterprise, and governing together.  Your support will help sustain our coop in these critical first few months and plants the seeds to strengthen immigrant-led coop movements across the Bay and beyond!</p>

We are the bridge between multiple industries needed to close the loop on fabrics. We are passionate about reducing waste and improving our community. We are committed to changing recycling locally so we can impact the rest of the world. We are geeks and specialists in the fields of textiles, communications, research and development, and project management. Around us we've got an amazing network of people who lend expertise in sustainability, marketing, law, business, apparel development, design, and more...Why Are We Doing This?Americans throw away 22 billion pounds of old clothing and fabrics every year. This is trillions of gallons of water, millions of pounds of fertilizers and pesticides, and significant amounts of energy dumped into landfills annually.REvolve sees an opportunity to create new jobs, help local businesses, and provide new educational opportunities by recycling instead of dumping. 
Today, the US only recycles 15% of our textile waste. 

REvolve is taking it to 50% and beyond, and we're helping the community while we're at it.
NOW is the time for REvolution!YOU can help us close the loop on textiles!How Will We Close the Loop?
Map what kinds of clothing and fabrics we donate or throw away
Collect and recycle more of these unwanted textiles
Enable new regional recycling and upcycling opportunities
Create more national recycling and upcycling opportunities

What Will REvolve Do With the Funds?

Estimated project start date: Feb '14More Project Details...
Project #1 was funded from our own pockets. It helped local 
artisans source sustainable, affordable materials and spend their hard 
earned dollars within the community. We also collected info on the kinds
 of clothing and fabrics people donate or throw away.What is Project #2?This project increases the amount of fabric we recycle. 
Recycling more creates job opportunities and supports local businesses. 
YOUR hard-earned dollars will build the model to collect America's fabric waste.
This project allows us to collaborate with students to tailor a new textile recycling message and collection strategy.

<div>
<p>Have you, or someone you know, ever looked for help or support in your community and not found it, when you really needed it, only to find out later that it was there all along? We have and we have talked to thousands of others who have been in the same situation.</p>
<p>Well we have found a solution.</p>
<p>The Team at If Everyone Cares (IEC) would like to introduce you to The Online Interactive Community Map - ODODOW.  Below we are going to give you a brief summary of the project, who it is for and how it will help to empower individuals and strengthen communities. Then we will let you know what we need and why and what you will get by supporting us. Finally we will share with you other ways in which you can help and give you the opportunity to suggest a perk that you would like to see us offer. (Please be realistic and polite - but you are encouraged to be creative)</p>
<p><strong>Before we start to properly introduce you to who we are and why we are doing this - here is a taster that may help you to understand that this really is a Huge ‘B-Hag’ - A BIG HAIRY AUDACIOUS GOAL! - But it IS achievable.</strong></p>
<p>After more than 2 years of research and feedback the IEC Team (all volunteers at present) truly believe that the creation of an Online Interactive Global Community Map provides a solution that has a true global perspective. It is not based on any one community, any one sector of life, any one country or any one issue … … it is based on Uniting People who need help, want to help, can help, etc with The Community Projects,  Non-Profits and Charities, around the Globe, that are providing it. The ripple effect from this is huge, in fact some have said ‘mind-blowing!’</p>
<h3><strong>What Is - ODODOW - The Interactive Community Map</strong></h3>

<p>Another question:</p>
<p>Do you know Google Earth? With a few clicks of a button you can find a hotel, restaurant, etc, in any area of the country or even the world.  The results give you ‘choice’ - the opportunity to make an informed and empowered decision.</p>
<p>Using similar technology, ODODOW will provide an innovative and flexible solution to some of the challenges faced by individuals and communities. It will be launched initially in the UK and focus on Four Key Areas of support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping those who need help - to find it</li>
<li>Sign-posting those who want to help - to projects that need their support.</li>
<li>Connecting New and Existing Projects to each other - so that they can share best practices, tools, strategies, services and more.</li>
<li>Encouraging businesses - to support projects within their local community, forging stronger community links.</li>
</ul>
<p>And all of this will be available free, 24/7, at the click of a button.</p>

<h3>
<strong>Our Mission</strong> - To Empower Individuals and Strengthen Communities - One Click at a Time.</h3>
<p>NB - Although ODODOW will be launched in the UK initially - once we have it up and running smoothly we will be ‘rolling’ it out globally. In fact we have people waiting to help us in America, Canada, Australia, India &amp; Europe. Meaning that, supporting us now will benefit every country in the long run.</p>
<h2><strong>To Make ODODOW a Reality We Now Need Your Help -</strong></h2>
<p>To date the volunteers and I have given more than 10,000 hours of our time and expertise along with thousands of pounds of our own money to get this far. Apart from all of the research that we have done, we have built a firm foundation and created sustainable business plan that we believe will have If Everyone Cares &amp; ODODOW self-funded within 3 years, from launch. Once we have progressed to a point where we generate profit we will set up a Trust/Foundation that will allocate grants to Community Focused Projects. </p>
<p>Before we share all of our perks with you we would like to give you a guide to how the money raised will be spent. Even though our initial goal is £50,000 we do have BIGGER goals as shown below.</p>

</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Brenda Braxton and I'm so proud to have been able to supply a much needed service by launching BBRAXTON; Exceptional Grooming for Exceptional Men, a men’s grooming salon in New York City. The salon is the first of its kind and occupies 2,000 sq. ft. of storefront in one of the city’s first “green” luxury high rise condominiums. The salon complements this evolution by providing the atmosphere of a traditional gentlemen's club, barber shop and new age spa; offering services such as hot towel straight razor shave, hair cuts and hair styling, body massage and integrated skin care. Patrons can catch up on the news, style trends, watch sports or relax and listen to R&amp;B or Jazz music streams. </p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 17px;"">What We Need </h3>
<p>While launching BBRAXTON in 2006 was an amazing undertaking it was also a personal financial drain. At that time bank financing for this new venture was impossible. The lending institutions could not wrap their heads around the concept of an upscale barber shop. So, by refinancing my home I was able to fund the entire start up costs and prove there was a market for this venue. But the economy has taken a toll on everyone and Small Businesess have felt it in a big way! Until now BBRAXTON has been able to survive through shear persistence and continually providing excellent custom service. But I now find I need help to keep our doors open and  go to the next level.</p>
<p>BBRAXTON  is raising  $60,000 to develop a BBRAXTON Product line which will continue to add revenue to the brand, launch a marketing/PR campaign and perform much needed salon repairs. To date, there are no other full service, upscale barbering parlors and spas in upper Manhattan (above 110th Street), thus BBRAXTON can still be considered a first to market venture, setting a precedent which has made it a staple of the present Harlem Community. </p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 17px;"">What funds will be used for</h3>
<p></p>
<p>BBRAXTON is seeking to establish its own brand of grooming products. Having a branded line of products will help our bottom line by allowing us to have a retail product that can be sold at our salon and website and eventually in other venues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our first product line is called First Shave by BBRAXTON ™ which is a three step shaving kit for the young first time shaver. It provides a regimen that  teaches the importance of proper grooming in life. First Shave by BBRAXTON™ is not just another shaving product. It's a young mans first step into manhood. It sets the tone for how he treats himself and how the world views him. To date there are no products that address this young niche. Most shave products are made for mature gentlemen and are too harsh for younger first time shavers. First Shave by BBRAXTON ™ is perfect for this demographic! </p>

<h3 style=""font-size: 17px;"">About Me</h3>
<p> Theater has been my life since I was 19 years old when I got my first Broadway show. I never thought I would find anything that gave me as much pleasure and fulfillment as being on stage until I launched BBRAXTON Exceptional Grooming for Exceptional Men. As an actress I always knew at some point I would have to figure out what I would do on that day when work didn't come as quickly as it use to. So when I launched BBRAXTON and felt the same thrill I knew this was my next passion and career! That feeling was further solidified when in 2009 I was the only woman honored with the “Men of Style Award ” given by Gillette Fuzion and the BBRAXTON salon hosted the Gillette Fuzion Tour in New York City for the second year.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>So here's a little about me. I am a native New Yorker (born in the Bronx) and graduate of the High School for the Performing Arts. At the moment I'm starring in an off Broadway show called Cougar The Musical. Previous to that I played  Velma Kelly in Broadway’s hit musical Chicago.  I was also featured on Broadway in the musical revue Smokey Joe’s Cafe, a performance that earned me a 1995 Tony Award nomination, the NAACP Theater Award, the city of Chicago’s Jefferson Award and a Grammy Award for Best Cast Album. My other Broadway credits include Jelly’s Last Jam, Cats, Legs Diamond and the original production of Dreamgirls.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In realizing the importance of giving back, I founded a not -for-profit organization called, Leading Ladies Just for Teens (LLJFT), seminars geared toward empowering young girls to be the best they can be. Leading Ladies began in 1996 at the Virginia Theater while I was performing in Smokey Joe's Cafe. They were a series of seminars designed to encourage, challenge and inspire young girls to dream and set goals. For my work with LLJFT I received the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “Living the Dream” Award given by New York Gov. George Pataki and the Josephine Baker Award from the National Council of Negro Women.</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p><span>On 7 June 2014, Elsa Hammond will depart from Monterey Bay, California to row at least 2,400 miles across the Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. Alone in a 24 foot rowing boat for up to three months, she will be subject to storms, seasickness and the psychological effects of so much time in total isolation. Along the way she will have encounters with rare marine life, plastic pollution, huge waves, flat calms, and many other experiences unique to rowing thousands of miles alone across open ocean. </span></p>
<p>Elsa is competing in the Great Pacific Race 2014: the inaugural rowing race in the Pacific Ocean organised by New Ocean Wave. Some may be familiar with the Atlantic rowing race, whichrunseach winter between La Gomera and Antigua. The Great Pacific Race is similar, but is the first ocean rowing race to attempt to cross part of the largest ocean in the world, and is therefore a big step forward in ocean rowing. There are no engines or sails involved in the race – instead, crews rely on their own muscle to propel their boats 2400 miles to Hawaii. New Ocean Wave have said that, “due to advances in on-board technology, boat design and materials, race organizers expect that most of the 24ft long, 6ft wide boats participating will break the route’s current world record of 64 days, set in 1997.” However, solo rowers like Elsa may well take up to 100 days to complete the race, depending on weather and conditions. The boats are ruggedly built to withstand the conditions that they will face in the Pacific, and will self-right in the event of capsize. Living conditions are basic: the toilet is a bucket, and drinking water is desalinated seawater. Elsa is currently the only female solo entrant from the UK.</p>
<p>Elsa is rowing in aid of the Plastic Oceans Foundation, an amazing charity that is tackling plastic pollution in our oceans. It is a UK based charity with international reach, and works to raise awareness of plastic pollution through film, education and social media. The race will take Elsa just south of the ‘Great Pacific garbage patch’, the most notorious example of concentrated plastic pollution, and Elsa is keen to raise awareness of this issue through her blog and updates during the row. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Ocean rowing isn't cheap! The whole project will cost £100,000. The majority of this will come from corporate sponsorship, but Elsa is hoping to raise £25,000 from individual and small business contributions to pay for the boat. On top of the boat there is a huge amount of equipment, insurance, race fees, travel and shipping, courses, accommodation at both ends, and food (8,000 calories a day!), which will come to around £100,000. Anything that Elsa raises over what is needed to make the row happen will go to charity and to raising awareness of the cause. She will not benefit financially from the row at all; aside from wanting to raise as much as possible to fight plastic pollution, it is against race rules!</p>
<p>There is a range of exciting perks ready for you to get your hands on, from personal phone calls from the middle of the ocean, to exclusive invitations to the launch party, to original artwork inspired by challenging the Pacific. Any perk over £5 also includes all the cheaper perks as well, so you get a whole range of exciting things for your money! Please get in touch if you wish to ask about any of the perks in more detail (and let me know if you'd rather remain anonymous).</p>
<p>Elsa is hoping to raise the full £25,000 in this campaign to pay for her boat. Not to worry if the full amount is not reached, however - every little bit helps towards this exciting challenge, and nothing will be wasted. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Rower</h3>
<p>Elsa rowed for her college at Oxford, and spent some time training with the University Women’s Squad at Durham. She has a history of adventurous expeditions, including unicycling across England, and sailing in the South Pacific. Elsa was born with a club foot, and has had multiple operations on it - the first when she was only months old. Having spent so much time in plaster when she was young made Elsa determined not to let this hold her back.She is determined, engaged and able to take on this challenge; she will spend the next year preparing her body and mind for the physical exertions and isolation of the row, as well as spending more time on the open water, and undertaking four courses with the Royal Yachting Association. </p>

<h3>I'll sum it up first, then to the story... </h3>
<p>We need $2,500.00 so that I, a young single mom, can get my Driver's License back!  No lies here, only humble honesty. I owe this money to the DMV for an accident that I was involved in a few years ago. It has been too long, and my family needs to be road worthy!  Imagine grocery shopping for a family without a car!  I don't want you to buy me a car, I am just asking you to help me become a legal driver again, so that maybe I can borrow one from time to time. It may sound small to you, but my life would be immeasurably simpler. </p>
<p>If you decide you can help (THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU), please take advantage of the Perks I have set up!  We would love to make you something to show our appreciation!  And remember: even a small amount will add to the bigger picture.</p>
<p>All donations up to the goal, even if goal is not reached, will go toward paying the DMV fees that are owed.  Any amount of money donated that exceeds the set goal will go into a savings fund we will be working on to buy an inexpensive used vehicle of our own. </p>
<p>Now for the slightly more gritty details of the sometimes painful truth, and my ride through tough lessons learned. </p>

<h3>Me and My Family...</h3>
<p>           <strong>and the accident.</strong></p>
<p>Hi there! My name is Kit.  I'm a young woman, and single mother of one beautiful seven year old girl named Zoe (she is the artist of the rocket picture).  I have worked hard all my life, never had anything handed to me.  I have fed, clothed, and sheltered myself since I was 15 and have provided all that my daughter has ever needed since her birth.  I was reacquainted with my own father when I was 20 (five years ago) and as an to attempt to mend some wounds he gave me the wonderful gift of a used car!  It wasn't much, but it was a convertible.  Sure, she might have been an old LeBaron, not much to look at, but she was mine and I could put the top down.  I felt so cool.  I had just gotten my license at the time.  Since I had been on my own at 15 I had never learned to drive, but having a young child made getting around incredibly difficult.  The car, and the driver's license, lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. Fast forward to just short of a year later. The worst thing I could have imagined came true.  I crashed that car.</p>
<p><img alt=""car in wall"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.gamesdash.com/limg/1/353/car-crushed-on-a-high-wall.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p> My daughter was in the back, and I thank Graco everyday for making a good carseat.  She wasn't injured at all.  I was another story though.  On the surface, I was ok.  The air bag knocked me out, but luckily it didn't give me a concussion.  My arm was all kinds of dark ominous colors from hitting something, but what really started to hurt after a while was my psyche.  Maybe it is worth mentioning that someone I was very close with had died in a car accident only months before, and I had still not recovered from the loss.  But I don't cave to my emotions, so instead I tried to brush it all off. What a mistake. I ended up having a long road to travel before I was able to face and deal with all the aftermath of that accident.  My father, who had a serious drinking problem at the time, had misinformed me about having added me to his insurance plan, as the car was still registered to him.  Since I did't have insurance, I was automatically found at fault. I lost my license, and began to have panic attacks in vehicles, especially when I was no longer the driver.  I felt like I was putting my life into someone else's hands, and I couldn't be sure they knew the true gravity of that.  Now, 4 years later, I have made a great deal of progress.  I have grown, and changed.  I have let go of the people I have lost, and accepted that life is a mess sometimes, and that mistakes do not make me a flawed person.  I'm even going to college, moving towards a career in Art Therapy.   And all through these last four years I have walked to the grocery store with a fold up rolling cart every single week.  I have hauled christmas presents on a two hour bus trip.  I have biked and skateboarded from one end of California to the other and walked more miles that I can count... And the truth is, I'm tired. I'm getting older, and I NEED to get my license back.  I don't know anyone that is as safe on the road as I am because no one has the kind of motivation to be a safe driver that I do. Get me on the road so I can take my daughter on vacation! Get me on the road so we can get a whole month's worth of groceries at once!  Get me on the road so I don't have to wonder how long it would take me to run uphill to the hospital if there were an emergency. Help me have the same piece of mind that so many families have. </p>
<p>It's funny how things change.  I suppose all we can do, as human beings, is try to navigate that change in the direction of positivity. </p>

<div> </div>
<div>One day I found myself crawling around under my car in the parking lot of a DIY store, struggling to find a place to secure a piece of string that I had tied to the rear window viper. I thought to myself: ""Why isn't there a more convenient solution to this! Every car owner must have had this problem several times!"".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So I started developing the product, and after several prototypes and extensive testing, I arrived at something that is simple and intuitive to use, and just works!</div>
<h3>The reason for this campaign</h3>
<div>Now the product is here - I have ""bootstrapped"" the project all the way. So with nothing but my own savings, I have developed the product and had a small batch produced, but I need your help to really get it off the ground. Specifically I have to:</div>
<p>1.Create a better packaging design with better images and graphics, so it will look better in the shops</p>
<p>2. Get the packaging and instructions translated to several languages</p>
<p>3. Add a small brightly colored bag, for increased safety while the product is in use, and for convenience when it is not in use</p>
<p>4. Get the product certified by an accredited testing agency</p>
<div>
<p>These things cost money, and require larger production runs. Your support will be a great help in order to take these next steps. And every bit helps - that is why I have chosen a flexible funding campaing, because even if I don't reach the full target I can still get started.</p>

Thanks a lot for checking out my campaign!
 
One day I found myself crawling around under my car in the parking lot of a DIY store, struggling to find a place to secure a piece of string that I had tied to the rear window viper. I thought to myself: ""Why isn't there a more convenient solution to this! Every car owner must have had this problem several times!"".
 
So I started developing the product, and after several prototypes and extensive testing, I arrived at something that is simple and intuitive to use, and just works!
The reason for this campaign
Now the product is here - I have ""bootstrapped"" the project all the way. So with nothing but my own savings, I have developed the product and had a small batch produced, but I need your help to really get it off the ground. Specifically I have to:
1.Create a better packaging design with better images and graphics, so it will look better in the shops
2. Get the packaging and instructions translated to several languages
3. Add a small brightly colored bag, for increased safety while the product is in use, and for convenience when it is not in use
4. Get the product certified by an accredited testing agency

These things cost money, and require larger production runs. Your support will be a great help in order to take these next steps. And every bit helps - that is why I have chosen a flexible funding campaing, because even if I don't reach the full target I can still get started.
 

How it works

Step 1: Push the buckle with the closed loop into the active part of the boot/trunk lid until you hear a ""click"". 
 
 
 

 
 
 

Step 2: Hook the other buckle into the passive part of the boot/trunk lid.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Step 3: Carefully tighten the strap with one hand, while supporting the boot/trunk lid with the other hand. Pull until the boot/trunk lid touches the protruding objects, and there is no slack between the buckles.
 
 
 
 
 

Step 4: All set and ready to go! Use the strap to mark the end of the objects you are transporting if need be.
The brightly colored bag will be attached to the end of the strap, for increased visibility in these situations.

<h3><strong>Conrad Evarts (406) 475-4994 or conradevarts@hotmail.com </strong></h3>
<h2>Digital Connect is a small computer shop in Nairobi, Kenya.</h2>
<p>Sisters Irene and Maureen operate Digital Connect. I have known them for seven years and their father for thirteen. My name is Conrad Evarts and over the past 13 years I've traveled extensively throughout Eastern and Southern Africa for my work as a television camera operator. You can read from the article linked above that Irene and I have worked successfully to take her from running a plow in her village to lecturing about computers at the University. She also writes code and adapts software to the Kenyan market.</p>
<p>We're now taking things to the next level. We are in the first few months of opening Digital Connect. It is a small shop selling laptops and tablets to students. We are selling new items at the moment because we can ship them from the US without paying tariffs. Irene now wants to expand into locally acquired refurbished computers for people that can't afford new units.</p>
<p>The new and refurbished computer sales will eventually fund a training center for ladies who want to increase their earning power by learning software. The training center will be operated by Irene and will be in the same neighborhood.</p>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Capital for refurbished computers. $300 USD per unit.</li>
</ul><div>
<h3>Why should you trust us?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can meet us anytime. We'll chat on the phone or tour you around Nairobi. Heck, come up to Montana and I'll take you fishing.</li>
<li>So far this entire endeavor is funded by my (Conrad) middle class salary. In fact I'm selling my car today (April 18) so I have more cash to invest when we return in June. I believe in Irene and the Kenyan economy very deeply.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We will grow this model of hi-tech opportunities for women across Kenya by eventualy franchising Digital Connect. Selling curios and soda pop is fine use of microloans for some women, but just as in the US there are Kenyan women that are capable of much more. The educated, energetic Kenyan woman owns a nimble and creative mind. By investing in this energy and creativity we all have the opportunity to benefit financially and environmentally.</p>
<h3>The Timing</h3>
I am heading back to Nairobi in June with my 14 year old daughter. we will be working with Irene and Maureen to grow this business, buy a business vehicle and work on understanding the market more thoroughly. We want to have the refurb investment money together before then so we can make a bulk purchase and restock the shop in mid-June.</div>
<h3>What do you get?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A look into east Africa’s largest economy and an opportunity to learn about investing in one of the world’s thriving developing economies.</li>
<li>An opportunity to assist in sustainable, long-term alleviation of poverty.</li>
<li>The ability to begin manifesting your dream of visiting Kenya in an authentic way by developing relationships with Kenyans.</li>
</ul><h2>What else do you get?</h2>
<h3>For $35...</h3>
<p>For $50 We will send you this beautiful pair of photos Laurie took in 2006 of Irene's Grandparents. When Laurie snapped these photos outside their home in Musalala where Irene grew up the ""Grands"" were married for 70 years. They were very proud of Irene's accomplishements at University. We are also posting a suggestion for framing. We can't afford to frame these, but this is how we did this in our home and it makes a great conversation piece. These are the first three photos in our gallery.</p>

<h3>For $2500: ""Investment Safari""</h3>
<p>The business desperately needs a car. We will be offering an ""Investment Safari"" to donors who contribute $2500 or more. This will be a series of meetings in Nairobi with young entrepreneurs over the course of four days. Irene and I will be your guides. If you like, we will also arrange for an animal safari (at your expense) to the Masi Mara and a few days in the mountains spending time with Bantu people. It will be a blast and get your feet wet in this incredible country filled with opportunity.</p>
<h3>For $7500: 2006 Mercury Montego</h3>

<p>106,5xx miles. Clean Carfax. VIN 1MEFM40106G611210</p>
<p>Well maintained and clean. Huge backseat and trunk, balanced ride and handling, attractive and functional cabin, excellent visibility. V6 3.0 6 speed transmission. 19/26 mpg. Traction Control.

<p>Hannah Conner, owner, and founder of the Little Lehigh Market Garden, first cultivated her love of plants and fresh food in her grandfather's vegetable patch.  This passion for things that grow lead her to pursue a B.S in Horticulture. After acquiring her degree, she ventured to the Washington D.C. area, where she became immersed in Organic CSA farming at Clagett Farm, operated by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. After 3 years of farming at Clagett, she decided to return to her hometown and took the position of Field Manager at Anchor Run CSA. Now with 6 years of organic growing experience, Hannah is thrilled to be fulfilling her dream of operating her own farm and hopes that her food and flowers will bring nourishment and happiness to the community!</p> <p>Lauren Rosse, field manager, is passionate about environmental preservation, and local healthy food. She has a B.A. in Non-Fiction Writing and over 3 years of farming experience including a summer working with Hannah at Anchor Run CSA. Lauren looks forward to using both her farming and writing skills to ensure Little Lehigh Market Garden is a benefit to the community.</p> <p>Mark Conner: Mark (Hannah's brother and Lauren's high school sweetheart) has a B.A. in English as well as a Masters of Library Science. Mark also spent time working for Hannah at Anchor Run CSA during college.

<p>Beginning in Spring of 2019, we will produce all of your favorite summer vegetables as well as berries, herbs, baby salad mixes, and handmade flower bouquets.</p> <p>Our growing practices will reflect our purpose to nourish and positively impact our community.  This means we grow with human and environmental health in mind. While we will not be certified Organic, we will follow USDA Organic standards that prohibit the use of dangerous synthetic chemicals as well as follow principles that promote biodiversity, protect the local watershed, and protect soil structure.<br/><br/>Our soil fertility will be provided by natural sources of nutrients such as compost. Pests will be controlled by physical barriers such as fencing and insect netting.  To reduce damage to the soil and prevent erosion, we plan to use a permanent bed system that reduces how often the soil is worked and includes perennial buffer strips that will soak up excess water and nutrients during rain events. The buffer strips will be planted in perennial flowers and herbs that encourage biodiversity on the farm and create a habitat for pollinators.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>D.E Lichtenwalner Farms</strong></p>
<p>In response to the limited farmland in Macungie and a passion for protecting local agriculture, the Lichtenwalner family made the decision to seek out young farmers who wanted to bring fresh food to their hometown. As a result, our market garden sits on 1.5 acres of the Lichtenwalner family farm.</p> <p>The Lichtenwalner family has owned and operated the farm for the past three generations. For many years it produced traditional crops like wheat, potatoes, corn, and soy. For the past several years, farm owner Mark has been growing summer vegetables including tomatoes, melons, and sweet corn.</p>

The buffer strips will be planted in perennial flowers and herbs that encourage biodiversity on the farm and create a habitat for pollinators. 
D.E Lichtenwalner Farms
In response to the limited farmland in Macungie and a passion for protecting local agriculture, the Lichtenwalner family made the decision to seek out young farmers who wanted to bring fresh food to their hometown. As a result, our market garden sits on 1.5 acres of the Lichtenwalner family farm. The Lichtenwalner family has owned and operated the farm for the past three generations. For many years it produced traditional crops like wheat, potatoes, corn, and soy. For the past several years, farm owner Mark has been growing summer vegetables including tomatoes, melons, and sweet corn.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Gourmet au Bay turned 20 in 2015! And because of supporters like you, we have grown to a point that our current location is just not working for us (and more importantly, YOU!). We need a bigger outside area, we need more parking, we need more inside seating...fortunately, we've been able to secure the only other available waterfront location in Bodega Bay. And we are expanding the concept of GAB to include a wood fired oven! The move is planned for April 2016.</p>
<p>All the planning and designing we are doing is with our customers in mind. We want the GAB experience to be better than ever. We are so excited about the opportunity to create an even better Gourmet au Bay.</p>
<p>That's where you come in. This move, although needed, wasn't entirely in the long term plan. We want to offer our customers some awesome deals in exchange for helping us procure the BEST wood fired oven - manufactured right here in Sonoma County!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The Mugnaini Wood Fired Oven is the best for what we want to create. The great news is the oven will be visible from the shop, so you will be able to watch flatbreads being fired in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The oven we need is $10,500. All the funds from this campaign will go toward the oven. Any funds over and above the cost of the oven will help us to offset the cost of building out the kitchen and shop.</p>
<p>We are offering some really awesome perks - discounted gift cards, exclusive T-Shirts and Hats, party's for you and your friends. AND our original Wine Surfboards are up for grabs! (Don't worry, we're having new ones made...Wine Surfing isn't going anywhere!)</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The difference this move and expansion will make for Gourmet au Bay is big! Because we are moving off the highway, we're confident the addition of a kitchen will entice folks to go the extra mile to find us. </p>
<p>We know you all are behind us and want us to continue. That's why we are asking for your help.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our biggest challenge other than budget is making sure that we are able to reach our customers - old and new! We've put together a great team of folks to help us design the new space and the menu. We have a marketing plan in place to get the word out about our new location.

   What We Need & What You Get

We need Your help to make this happen. The funds we raise through this campaign will be used to facilitate sensitization programs, start up-cycling centers, create vermi-compost pits and organize street plays to be performed in public spaces and institutions.

Each of our funders will get very special merchandise which will be the output of our up-cycling workshops with schools, NGOs and communities. 
In case we do not reach our target, we will still continue the work but will have to scale down the outreach and planned activities.

    The Impact Through this project we reach out to marginalized communities and urban villages and slums in Delhi and generate awareness about the issue of 'Solid Waste Management' and initiate on-ground projects.
Through our up-cycling centers create opportunities for Social Entrepreneurship.
Create community-specific models and innovative solutions which can be replicated in other communities and cities.

<p><span>At the end of. . . well, most days, we like to relax and unwind with a good glass (or three) of wine. We call this glorious time “wine down.”</span></p>
<p>When we worked office jobs in downtown San Francisco, we'd count down the minutes until we could grab after-work drinks.  No matter how many places we tried, we never found the right bar. We’d consistently find ourselves sacrificing quality, comfort, or our hard-earned dollars, and so were our co-workers and friends.</p>

For those who weren't able to participate in the campaign, it's not too late to support Wine Down & get some awesome swag:
Order your ""Drink Up!"" t-shirt or hoodie today, and every time you wear it to Wine Down, you'll get 10% off your bill!

At the end of. . . well, most days, we like to relax and unwind with a good glass (or three) of wine. We call this glorious time “wine down.”
When we worked office jobs in downtown San Francisco, we'd count down the minutes until we could grab after-work drinks.  No matter how many places we tried, we never found the right bar. We’d consistently find ourselves sacrificing quality, comfort, or our hard-earned dollars, and so were our co-workers and friends.

One day (over some wine, of course), we decided to take the leap and create that magical spot ourselves.  We set out to make drinking wine and beer more fun, sustainable, and down-to-earth so you’ll always have the perfect place to ""wine down"" your days.
We've been researching, planning, and working on Wine Down for over two years. We asked over 100 people what they want in a bar—they answered and, through Wine Down, we'll deliver:

Value:  We're all about maximizing enjoyment, so we won't compromise on quality or affordability.  We’ve searched high and low to find the best, local wine and beer at a good price from producers who share our values.  We'll also offer bites with the same philosophy.

A laid-back vibe: We believe a bar should be a fun place to hang out and relax, without any fuss.  That's why we're building a cool, simple bar with a short menu, so you can spend less time deciding what to drink and more time drinking. We'll rotate it frequently so there's always something new.

Our job is to make sure you're enjoying yourself and your drinks.










We're launching this campaign to give our community the opportunity to get more involved with Wine Down's early 2016 opening and to bring some of the finer details of Wine Down to life.

With your support, we're aiming to raise $10,000.  We've personally invested our own savings, as have many of our family and friends, but this campaign will help us cross the finish line with everything from outfitting our outside patio to getting precious under-counter hooks in place.

Teinud uuringuid ja koostanud äriplaani, kasutanud palju aega ja raha, et kohtuda inimestega kes teavad, mis meile parim. Oleme jõudnud arvamusele, et äri alustamine saab olema edukas.

Kõiki kingitusi, kus on kirjas ""kolmekordne tasuta sissepääs"" ja ""viiekordne tasuta sissepääs"" saab kohandada endale just nii nagu sina seda soovid - kas kasutad neid ise või jagad ka sõpradega.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Slackers Brewing Co. is a family-owned brewery opening in Anderson Mill in Austin, Texas — a place where everyone is welcome and craft beer is approachable.</p>
<p>Not only are we creating a quality brewery, but a community space where diverse groups of people can gather and connect.</p>
<p>And as parents, we know the importance of having a place the whole family can enjoy — which is why Slackers will be a family-friendly brewery. You’ll be able to bring your kids while relaxing over a beer, a bite, or cup of local coffee.</p>
<p>Craft will be celebrated in all its forms — musicians, artists and others will be able to share their work within our walls.</p>
<p>My name is Derek, and Slackers Brewing Co. is my dream. My wife Haley and I are working tirelessly to realize this dream — but we need help.</p>
<p>With your help, we can add the important finishing touches to the brewery — and open our doors in only a few months’ time.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We’ve made so much progress over the last two years, and have the brewery design complete. We’re now working with the city to finalize permits to begin construction in just a few weeks. </p>
<p>Everything up to this point has been funded by my wife and I — but with the addition of a kitchen to support the zoning laws of the area, we need some additional support. The great news is that this means we’ll offer a menu of food and snacks to eat while you’re enjoying delicious craft beer and coffee.</p>
<p>The additional $25,000 will go towards the plumbing, buildout, equipment and grease trap to add the kitchen to our brewery. </p>
<p>Curious what the brewery will look like with this sweet new setup? Here’s a peek at the design:</p>

<p>Pinkpeas has officially launched their LOVE Bomb. Help us save this precious and invaluable resource to
pregnant women and families in the Las Vegas Valley. Read on to see how you can
help.</p><p>
<span>Pinkpeas Pregnancy and Parenting Care Center is
a family-centered, community-based, 501(c)(3) nonprofit pregnancy and parenting
care group located in Las Vegas, Nevada. In our building we provide an endless
list of services, mostly free or low cost. These include, but are not limited
to: Prenatal care, childbirth education, well baby checks, postpartum support
groups, cesarean support group, breastfeeding information and support, vaccine
information classes, babywearing support, homeschooling information,
homeopathic and essential oil classes, stuff swaps, holiday parties, play
dates, food coops, and so much more.</span></p>
<p>Pinkpeas has not always been a building though.
Our founder has been working for more than a decade to provide incredible, life
changing and affordable care to women and their unborn children.  And she
has been successful. The testimonies abound in Las Vegas at how Pinkpeas has
changed their lives for the better. <b>We
grow women. Wives. Families.</b> </p>
<p>For the last 5 years, we have been paying our
expenses, barely. We have been doing this at the expense of our founder
herself. This model is no longer sustainable and we seek the help and support
of the community to in turn support this invaluable resource center. As it
turns out, our lease is due for renewal on March 31<sup>st</sup>. For each $20,000
raised, we can continue the lease on our building for one year and we can help
hundreds of women have high quality pregnancy care. Ideally, we would love to
see $60,000 so that we may sign a new three year lease. <b>All of our directors are volunteers. We have never taken, and will
never take a paycheck for the work we do and the love we provide through
Pinkpeas. 100% of all monies donated will go directly to providing pregnant
women with incredible prenatal care</b>. In the event that we do not raise
enough for another year in our current location, all monies will be used to renting
out various spaces in the valley from other business owners for prenatal care
to our community.</p>
<p>As a nation, we have come to a
time of uncertainty for many about the future of their healthcare. The younger
generation is footing the bill for the older. Where does this leave our women
of childbearing years? How many young women aren’t seeking care for the next
generation due to financial reasons? Many more than you might think. Seeking
prenatal care through an OB can cost hundreds of dollars per visit within most
healthcare plans now. Many families are faced with a terrible choice: prenatal
care or rent. Or food for their young family. Or paying other crucial bills.</p>
<p><b>HELP US HELP THEM.</b></p>
<p>Pinkpeas offers prenatal care
that is affordable. Not just any prenatal care either. Sure, pregnant women can
weigh themselves, hear the heartbeat of their unborn, check blood pressure, but
there is so much more to actual care than that. Pinkpeas prenatal care consists
of groups that are 2 hours in length and offered two days each week. Women come
in to share concerns, questions, trials and triumphs to a caring team of women
who fully understand what it takes to give great care and to receive great
care.</p>
<p>Imagine. The rising generation
of mothers…….. being mothered themselves. Being built up and loved. Being
encouraged throughout the most vulnerable time in life – pregnancy, to go back
home and give their husbands, homes and families what they need to thrive. It’s
not typical, but it IS normal. And necessary. Welcome to Pinkpeas. How can we
help you?</p>
<p>How can you help us? We need
the help of our community. YOU.  Pinkpeas has not always been a building,
but our building is crucial to the success of hundreds of families in our city.
A small, yet tangible way you can help is to donate $60. Sixty dollars gives a
woman in need a prenatal appointment with our team at Pinkpeas. Help us help
the next young mother that comes through our doors. Help us keep our doors
open. 100% of monies contributed are eligible to be tax exempt, as Pinkpeas is
a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Not a single dollar goes into the pockets of our staff.
We volunteer because we care about the next generations of mothers. Do you?</p>
<p><b>If you or anyone you know has benefited from our
organization, whether 10 days ago or 10 years ago, please consider helping us</b>.  Your contributions will be the foundation for Pinkpeas to
continue to support families for many years to come.

Pinkpeas has officially launched their LOVE Bomb. Help us save this precious and invaluable resource to
pregnant women and families in the Las Vegas Valley. Read on to see how you can
help.
Pinkpeas Pregnancy and Parenting Care Center is
a family-centered, community-based, 501(c)(3) nonprofit pregnancy and parenting
care group located in Las Vegas, Nevada. In our building we provide an endless
list of services, mostly free or low cost. These include, but are not limited
to: Prenatal care, childbirth education, well baby checks, postpartum support
groups, cesarean support group, breastfeeding information and support, vaccine
information classes, babywearing support, homeschooling information,
homeopathic and essential oil classes, stuff swaps, holiday parties, play
dates, food coops, and so much more.
Pinkpeas has not always been a building though.
Our founder has been working for more than a decade to provide incredible, life
changing and affordable care to women and their unborn children.  And she
has been successful. The testimonies abound in Las Vegas at how Pinkpeas has
changed their lives for the better. We
grow women. Wives. Families. 
For the last 5 years, we have been paying our
expenses, barely. We have been doing this at the expense of our founder
herself. This model is no longer sustainable and we seek the help and support
of the community to in turn support this invaluable resource center. As it
turns out, our lease is due for renewal on March 31st. For each $20,000
raised, we can continue the lease on our building for one year and we can help
hundreds of women have high quality pregnancy care. Ideally, we would love to
see $60,000 so that we may sign a new three year lease. All of our directors are volunteers. We have never taken, and will
never take a paycheck for the work we do and the love we provide through
Pinkpeas. 100% of all monies donated will go directly to providing pregnant
women with incredible prenatal care. In the event that we do not raise
enough for another year in our current location, all monies will be used to renting
out various spaces in the valley from other business owners for prenatal care
to our community.
As a nation, we have come to a
time of uncertainty for many about the future of their healthcare. The younger
generation is footing the bill for the older. Where does this leave our women
of childbearing years? How many young women aren’t seeking care for the next
generation due to financial reasons? Many more than you might think. Seeking
prenatal care through an OB can cost hundreds of dollars per visit within most
healthcare plans now. Many families are faced with a terrible choice: prenatal
care or rent. Or food for their young family. Or paying other crucial bills.
HELP US HELP THEM.
Pinkpeas offers prenatal care
that is affordable. Not just any prenatal care either. Sure, pregnant women can
weigh themselves, hear the heartbeat of their unborn, check blood pressure, but
there is so much more to actual care than that. Pinkpeas prenatal care consists
of groups that are 2 hours in length and offered two days each week. Women come
in to share concerns, questions, trials and triumphs to a caring team of women
who fully understand what it takes to give great care and to receive great
care.
Imagine. The rising generation
of mothers…….. being mothered themselves. Being built up and loved. Being
encouraged throughout the most vulnerable time in life – pregnancy, to go back
home and give their husbands, homes and families what they need to thrive. It’s
not typical, but it IS normal. And necessary. Welcome to Pinkpeas. How can we
help you?
How can you help us? We need
the help of our community. YOU.  Pinkpeas has not always been a building,
but our building is crucial to the success of hundreds of families in our city.
A small, yet tangible way you can help is to donate $60. Sixty dollars gives a
woman in need a prenatal appointment with our team at Pinkpeas. Help us help
the next young mother that comes through our doors. Help us keep our doors
open. 100% of monies contributed are eligible to be tax exempt, as Pinkpeas is
a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Not a single dollar goes into the pockets of our staff.
We volunteer because we care about the next generations of mothers. Do you?
If you or anyone you know has benefited from our
organization, whether 10 days ago or 10 years ago, please consider helping us.  Your contributions will be the foundation for Pinkpeas to
continue to support families for many years to come.

Dude!  Thatâ€™s A Lot of Stuffâ€¦How Does it All Work?
Itâ€™s cool, weâ€™re both a jack of all trades and all about

Either way, this will happen, but don't you want to know that YOU had a part in making it happen? Plus, you get to have things that no one else gets to have! Take that, other people!
Powerful Impact, Boom, From The Cannon
     You, and only you, can help make this happen. Like we mentioned above, it's going to happen in some way/shape/or form regardless, but you can make it happen in the way that it was meant to happen! I'm calling you to action, don't you get it?
Other Kinds Of Love
     Whether you are able to give monetarily or not, you can still help further by telling others about our campaign. Just think of us as fighting the good fight, and you're on our side (or we're on yours, whatever it takes). Spreading the word helps us all.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi My name is Nick Maleta. I grew up in Santa
Cruz California in a little town called Soquel. For the most part, there isn't
much going on in this small town but I was lucky enough to grow up next to a
winery that my great grandpa, John Bargetto, founded after prohibition in 1933.
Growing up right next to all of those smells and sounds of crushing and
fermenting grapes quickly drew me into an interest in the wine industry. </p>
<p>My mother's first cousins now own and operate
the winery and since my immediate family has no financial ties to the facility
I had to learn what I could from the winemakers but start projects on my own.
Since the purchase of grapes is very expensive compared to apples I decided to
experiment a bit with making cider. Luckily enough, the winemaker at the winery
was very experienced in cider making and was very helpful in my projects. </p>
<p>After making some batches of hard apple cider
I began to really enjoy the taste. As the years went by, I realized that there
might be a market for Hard Cider. One day at the super market a few years back,
I tried one of the first hard ciders i've seen for sale commercially, and it
hit me that people were actually willing to buy and sell the stuff. My dream to
become one of the first dry and semi-dry hard cider producers in this
agriculturally rich region took off from there! I put it all together; I had
the access to a legally bonded winery for my production of relatively large
batches of cider and I also had some farming connections in nearby Pajaro
Valley which still has some great old orchards. </p>
<p>The goal is to start off relatively small with
just a few oak barrels and some decent equipment. I figure if I keep in mind
quality and careful craft of the cider, what will start off as small production
may very well turn into a successful self-sustaining business someday!</p>

</ul>
<b>Sustainability &amp; Restoration Efforts</b><p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>All of our crops are grown using sustainable agricultural practices, such as planting a diverse mix of crops, composting to build soil fertility, and using an integrated pest management approach.</li>
<li>Our sustainability efforts extend beyond the farmed areas of our property. We plan to protect/restore our farm's ecosystem by preserving natural spaces, replacing invasive species with native plants, and creating wildlife habitat.</li>
<li>By restoring and protecting our farm ecosystem, we're creating a vibrant, and dynamic, natural classroom that allows us to increase our understanding of the world around us.</li>

</ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What the Funding Will Be Used For</h3> <p>To ensure that we are able to provide a quality product to our community and meet our 300 crate commitment, we need to purchase the following:</p> <ul>
<li>Drip irrigation and water storage - sufficient watering aids plant growth and makes crops less susceptible to disease</li>
<li>Seed starting supplies - we've been starting our own seeds for many years, but need to scale up our operation to meet the demands of a community farm</li>
<li>Tools and implements - since most of the work will be done by hand, it is important to have quality tools to do the job efficiently</li>
<li>Cold storage - harvested crops must be stored in a controlled environment prior to delivery to protect quality, flavor &amp; nutritional value</li>
<li>Packaging and delivery supplies - includes delivery crates and setting up a prep/packaging area</li>
<li>Crop protection - includes solar fencing, pest control netting, and frost protection to extend the growing season</li>

<p><br/></p>
<p> Anytime you take on a new endeavor, especially a project of this magnitude, there are bound to be unforeseen challenges that crop up. We believe the following factors will allow us to overcome these challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a well-researched and thorough plan that has been developed over a period of several years.</li>
<li>We plan to follow sound sustainable agricultural practices to avoid/mitigate some of the traditional risks associated with farming (pest infestations, plant diseases, crop failure, etc.).</li>
<li>We have extensive personal experience in the fields of biology, science education, and business, which will help us in various aspects of our project.</li>
<li>During the last 10 years, we've planted over 100 varieties of vegetables and experimented with a number of growing techniques to find what works best.</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Most importantly, we are not taking on this project alone:</b></div>
<ul>
<li>We will be partnering with individuals and organizations in our local community who want to help build something meaningful.</li>
<li>We have a personal network of new and experienced farmers to share information with and learn from.</li>
<li>We have a personal network of amazingly talented and insightful educators who are willing to collaborate with us on our educational initiative.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

It could be a family in need, a local hero who deserves a pat on the back, or just someone who could use a little pick-me-up.

Sustainability & Restoration Efforts


All of our crops are grown using sustainable agricultural practices, such as planting a diverse mix of crops, composting to build soil fertility, and using an integrated pest management approach.
Our sustainability efforts extend beyond the farmed areas of our property. We plan to protect/restore our farm's ecosystem by preserving natural spaces, replacing invasive species with native plants, and creating wildlife habitat.
By restoring and protecting our farm ecosystem, we're creating a vibrant, and dynamic, natural classroom that allows us to increase our understanding of the world around us.


   
What the Funding Will Be Used For To ensure that we are able to provide a quality product to our community and meet our 300 crate commitment, we need to purchase the following: 
Drip irrigation and water storage - sufficient watering aids plant growth and makes crops less susceptible to disease
Seed starting supplies - we've been starting our own seeds for many years, but need to scale up our operation to meet the demands of a community farm
Tools and implements - since most of the work will be done by hand, it is important to have quality tools to do the job efficiently
Cold storage - harvested crops must be stored in a controlled environment prior to delivery to protect quality, flavor & nutritional value
Packaging and delivery supplies - includes delivery crates and setting up a prep/packaging area
Crop protection - includes solar fencing, pest control netting, and frost protection to extend the growing season

Risks & ChallengesThe project scope is scaleable, which helps to minimize much of the risk. If we only receive funding for 200 crates, the associated costs for irrigation, crop protection and other supplies go down proportionately. The program can still be implemented, although the reach and impact will be reduced.

 Anytime you take on a new endeavor, especially a project of this magnitude, there are bound to be unforeseen challenges that crop up. We believe the following factors will allow us to overcome these challenges:

We have a well-researched and thorough plan that has been developed over a period of several years.
We plan to follow sound sustainable agricultural practices to avoid/mitigate some of the traditional risks associated with farming (pest infestations, plant diseases, crop failure, etc.).
We have extensive personal experience in the fields of biology, science education, and business, which will help us in various aspects of our project.
During the last 10 years, we've planted over 100 varieties of vegetables and experimented with a number of growing techniques to find what works best.

Most importantly, we are not taking on this project alone:

We will be partnering with individuals and organizations in our local community who want to help build something meaningful.
We have a personal network of new and experienced farmers to share information with and learn from.
We have a personal network of amazingly talented and insightful educators who are willing to collaborate with us on our educational initiative.

</li>
<li>My name is Robert DeDomenico.  For over three years now, I have been <strong>developing a prototype</strong> <strong>system for the automated utility transport of small payloads, such as a gallon of milk, or a loaf of bread</strong>.  At a cost of only $4,500 so far, the major design work, most of the construction of the first vehicle subassembly, and construction of the first section of test track are already complete.  I am a lifelong tinkerer.  I grew up on a farm and began experiencing equipment maintenance and repair from a young age.  I have been a submariner, electronics technician, nuclear operator, and computer scientist, and have actively enjoyed the hobbies of model railroading, bicycling, sailing, windsurfing, hang gliding, scuba diving, and RC cars &amp; helicopters.  </li>
<li><strong>My goal is to change the world by revolutionizing the way we transport solid physical objects, to help us live well, stay healthy, and enjoy life.  Winning first place will help me achieve this.</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>I will complete the first demonstration prototype system, and use this demonstrator to win private and government backing for a first real service installation</strong>.  I have just submitted an application to the New York State Energy Research Development Authority (NYSERDA), Program Opportunity Notice 2781 Advanced Transportation Concepts.  I will also be submitting an abstract to the US Department of Energy Unsolicited Proposal Program.  Success in this campaign will enhance each of these applications.</li>
<li>Implementation of <strong>this technology will</strong> <strong>revolutionize the way we shop for groceries, get prescriptions, send and receive the mail, discard trash… move any small payload in general… down the block, around town or across state</strong>.  It will reduce miles driven in America by between 5% and 10%, with a proportional drop in traffic congestion, accident rates, and demand for petroleum fuel.  As containerized freight has done in long haul transport, this technology will will do in ""last mile"" distribution, reducing handling costs and final prices while improving the availability and variety of goods to us all.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some background on the problem and solution:  </strong>In America, we consume about<strong> </strong>100 quadrillion BTU's of energy per year.  (Global consumption is about 500 quads.)<strong>  </strong>About 40% of this is oil, and about two thirds of that is for transportation.<strong>  </strong>In addition to moving people, vehicles of course transport materials and goods.  Energy to move materials and goods is typically boiled down to units of BTU's consumed per ton of payload per mile of transport, or BTU per ton-mile.  The most efficient movement of material and goods is by water, rail, and pipeline, all typically on the order of a few hundred BTU/ton-mile.  The US trucking industry moves payloads for a few thousand BTU/ton-mile.  When we move goods with our cars though, we are using a few thousand BTU's per mile whether we are carrying anything or not, and how often are we carrying a ton of goods?  Let's take an example of driving to the local sandwich shop in the morning for some breakfast sandwiches and a gallon of milk.<strong>  </strong>The milk weighs a whopping 8 pounds, and the sandwiches might add up to another pound, but let's just say two.  The whole payload then is 10 lbs, or 1/200th of a ton.  If the car were a Prius getting 57 mpg,<strong> </strong>it is still burning 2,000 BTU per mile.  So the payload is moving for 400,000 BTU per ton mile... one way!  (The driver had to make a round trip.)  The CargoFish system will be able to move this same payload for about 20 BTU's per mile.  (That's energy burned at the electric plant, and counting all the losses of conversion to electricity, distribution, and vehicle efficiency.)  Our almost universal assumption that in order to move anything any reasonable distance on an immediate basis requires a car, is actually incorrect.  It requires moving only what matters, and as little else as possible.  Imagine if we all had to transport every gallon of water home as if from the grocery store.  Driving it all wouldn't be a very effective solution, would it?  Please feel free to ask about any concerns you have.  My concern is that it is unsustainable to continue putting thousands of pounds of motorized machinery in motion every time we want to get a few pounds from here to there.  I think we can do better, and I hope you agree because I need your vote to win first place, which will help immensely with getting a faster pace going on developing and implementing this technology.  Thank you very much.  I will not let you down.<br/><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to prove the technical and fiscal feasibility of this system well enough to warrant investment, people are going to need to see it.  I need to complete the demonstration prototype of about 400 feet of track and at least one vehicle.  The current material cost for track adds up to $6 per foot, totaling $2,400 for this phase.  I also need to progress the first vehicle, whose first wheel set is nearly done, by finishing this assembly, building another identical wheel set, then constructing the main body frame and assembling all three into a completed vehicle.  The motor, controller, wheels, racks, gears, pulleys, belts, bearings, shafts, fasteners, and frame materials for the first wheel set totaled about $1,000.  Another $1,000 will be needed for the second wheel set assembly.  My present estimate for the components and materials necessary to complete the main frame, assemble these three into one vehicle, and install an initial control system is another $600.  With this total of $4,000 for parts and materials, I will be able to complete a system able to demonstrate semi-autonomous control of one vehicle over any emulated arbitrary path.</li>
<li>I have a website for the project, where I will post a list of every contributor to this campaign.  Every contributor will be invited to selected project milestone(s), such as first public demonstration.  Other perks include bundle(s) of free service, redeemable when this system becomes available at the contributors'  primary abode, vacation house, or place of business.  (See the specific perks for details.)</li>
<li>The first $1,600 of funds raised will go toward completion of the first vehicle.</li>
<li>The next $2,400 of funds raised will go toward test track construction.</li>
<li>Additional winnings will be used to build 3 additional vehicles.</li>
<li>Funds beyond that will be used carefully, in support of the project.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong>This project will raise our standard of living</strong>.  This technology is the closest thing to the Star Trek transporter that the world will ever realize.  <strong>It will become the Physical Internet</strong>, connecting most households in the US.  Even before reaching that level of adoption, early <strong>installations in senior living complexes will restore a significant measure of self-sufficiency to many of us as we age</strong>, as independent travel by driving or otherwise becomes more inconvenient, difficult, or altogether impossible.  Other early adoption communities will have <strong>residents enjoying more free time</strong> as they do not find themselves compelled to travel for needs that must be met more immediately than mail order, Fedex, or UPS.  <strong>Businesses will exchange documents and/or other physical objects at levels of service exceeding the best and fastest courier companies, at a fraction of the cost</strong>.  More workers will be able to telecommute because they will not be limited to exchanging only voice and information over the telephone and Internet.  Because this technology will prove worth installing, <strong>an entire industry will grow to install, maintain, and expand it</strong>, providing local construction, maintenance, operation and administration jobs wherever it goes.  <strong>The reduction in transportation fuel consumption will boost the economy.</strong>  In addition to small payloads, all of these benefits can be delivered by this technology.</p>
<p>This will be no more expensive than municipal water or sewer.  Those systems involve miles of underground infrastructure, yet are the most effective and inexpensive way to deliver water and remove waste.  The household bill for those services is low enough that most people have to look it up to tell me how much it costs.  Don't jump to premature conclusions about something ""totally not plausible"", or too expensive to prove practical.  Infrastructure does cost, but returns enormous value, and, spread out over millions of customers the costs are more affordable than the alternative of doing without.  Please take the time to browse the comments, where I have re-posted several of my favorite correspondences received.</p>
<p>I’ve recently given a presentation to the Rowan University Honors Engineering class of 2016, as well as another to several officials at the New York State Energy Research Development Authority.</p>

<p><strong>Two Tasty Ladies Catering and Events Start Up Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Two Tasty Ladies have banded together to create a large, vintage style, charge at your next event!  We need your help to make this happen!</p>
<p><strong>What’s Our Tale, Nightingale?</strong></p>
<p>We are Suzanne and Shawna, co-owners of Two Tasty Ladies Catering and Events.  Our style is way out, never square, and our service is straight up and vintage!  Our events are made in the shade so all you need to do is make the scene!</p>
<p>Translation:  Our goal is to facilitate unique and inviting event experiences through our interpersonal and vintage style services. </p>
<p>Two Tasty Ladies has already begun to establish itself in the catering community.  We have provided catering and decor services for several clients and have successfully navigated a large, live band and dance for approximately 300 people.  We have several bookings in the works for the next few months and have been invited to join several community events throughout the city of Toronto.  Up to this point, we have had to rely on rental kitchens for food production and the use of our own homes for equipment storage.</p>
<p>Once fully established in our own location, with your help, Two Tasty Ladies will be able to provide jobs for upwards of 50 staff and will be able to support our local charities of choice and abroad.  We have decided that a portion of our profits from every event will be set aside for The Bequia Mission.  The Bequia Mission is a strictly volunteer, non-profit, registered Canadian charity which supports over 15 different charitable organizations throughout St. Vincent and the Grenadines providing food services for the elderly, school supplies for schools, medicine for hospitals, clinics, children with HIV/AIDS hospices and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Let Us Clue You In – We’ll Give it to you Straight!</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise $15,000 to help cover the start up costs for our dream company.  These costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Licensing and Insurance</li>
<li>Marketing tools and Web hosting</li>
<li>Incorporation</li>
<li>Supplies and Equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>Your generous donations will help launch our dream and support us in our first few months.  As we establish our business, we will be able to start giving back to our community and The Bequia Mission.</p>
<p>In exchange, we are offering Tasty Perks such as: discounted services, gift certificates, free canapés and gift baskets.</p>
<p>If you want your dollars to go further, you can choose not to receive a perk.  Either way, you know you are helping build a dream and make a difference in many people’s lives at home here in Toronto and abroad.</p>
<p><strong>Dig what we do, but don’t have the bread?</strong></p>
<p>We also accept your words of support and encouragement, your belief in us and our causes and your help to share our dream with your family and friends.</p>
<p>Please use the share tools here on Indiegogo and other social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and personal emails to get the word out.  We appreciate every little bit of help we receive!</p>

Two Tasty Ladies have banded together to create a large, vintage style, charge at your next event!  We need your help to make this happen!
What’s Our Tale, Nightingale?
We are Suzanne and Shawna, co-owners of Two Tasty Ladies Catering and Events.  Our style is way out, never square, and our service is straight up and vintage!  Our events are made in the shade so all you need to do is make the scene!
Translation:  Our goal is to facilitate unique and inviting event experiences through our interpersonal and vintage style services. 
Two Tasty Ladies has already begun to establish itself in the catering community.  We have provided catering and decor services for several clients and have successfully navigated a large, live band and dance for approximately 300 people.  We have several bookings in the works for the next few months and have been invited to join several community events throughout the city of Toronto.  Up to this point, we have had to rely on rental kitchens for food production and the use of our own homes for equipment storage.
Once fully established in our own location, with your help, Two Tasty Ladies will be able to provide jobs for upwards of 50 staff and will be able to support our local charities of choice and abroad.  We have decided that a portion of our profits from every event will be set aside for The Bequia Mission.  The Bequia Mission is a strictly volunteer, non-profit, registered Canadian charity which supports over 15 different charitable organizations throughout St. Vincent and the Grenadines providing food services for the elderly, school supplies for schools, medicine for hospitals, clinics, children with HIV/AIDS hospices and much more.
Let Us Clue You In – We’ll Give it to you Straight!
We need to raise $15,000 to help cover the start up costs for our dream company.  These costs include:

Licensing and Insurance
Marketing tools and Web hosting
Incorporation
Supplies and Equipment

Your generous donations will help launch our dream and support us in our first few months.  As we establish our business, we will be able to start giving back to our community and The Bequia Mission.
In exchange, we are offering Tasty Perks such as: discounted services, gift certificates, free canapés and gift baskets.
If you want your dollars to go further, you can choose not to receive a perk.  Either way, you know you are helping build a dream and make a difference in many people’s lives at home here in Toronto and abroad.
Dig what we do, but don’t have the bread?
We also accept your words of support and encouragement, your belief in us and our causes and your help to share our dream with your family and friends.
Please use the share tools here on Indiegogo and other social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and personal emails to get the word out.  We appreciate every little bit of help we receive!
Find us – the Two Tasty Ladies Catering & Events on Facebook, Twitter, and on our website, www.twotastyladies.ca.

<p>4 years ago, I lost my wife, Cheryl Fernandez Louie, to brain cancer and she was survived by our daughter Cevan who is now 5. My late wife handled tourism for Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, runner up Miss Hawaii, academic scholar with a Political Science Degree from University of Hawaii, Woman of the Year, and devoted to her faith and philanthopy for helping others. Since she passed, I devoted our passion to making a difference in others lives and building a legacy for our daughter's future. We are devoted to this cause in memory of those we love dearly lost to cancer. We also lost her father last year and my father is diagnosed with terminal Gall Bladder cancer stage 4.</p>

<p>As a team, we strive to help change the state of educational standards for our youth with Nevada being ranked 50 out of 50 in the U.S., a near 50% high school drop out rate, and the need for pursuit of higher level education. In the first two weeks of our launch in May 2012, we gave out thousands of FREE SHAVED ice to teachers as a token of appreciation to the educators in our community to every elementary and middle school in 9 zip codes. We didn't sell a single shaved ice in the first two weeks. Both my business partner, James Zhang, who lost his father to cancer, and I have not taken a single dime in salary because we believe in the future of Kona Ice Las Vegas and Henderson.</p>

<p>Since our launch, we now have hundreds of partners including over 60 schools, largest sports associations / leagues, non-profits, largest churches, community centers, universities, chambers of commerce, civic organizations, corporations, and retail strip malls. Kona Ice Las Vegas &amp; Henderson has received awards from UNLV, Opportunity Village, Mayor of Las Vegas Carolyn Goodman, U.S. Congressional Award from Dina Titus, commendation award from U.S. Senator Harry Reid, and even invited to the Presidential Inauguration by the Presidential Inauguration committee. All in one year with ONE shaved ice truck, hundred plus volunteers across the cities and other states, and the belief in making our community stronger. As a national brand, we have won #1 Entrepreneur Franchise 500 in the entire U.S.. As owners of Kona Ice Las Vegas and Henderson, we also own the largest territory in the U.S. comprised of 11 franchise territories.</p>
<p>Our target goals is to raise a target minimum of $432,000 and if we reach $826,000 it would meet our full fleet deployment across our 11 territories. The funding will be used for 1.) Working capital for salaries of event coordination / community organizers, recruitment of Full-Time and Part-Time employees, marketing operational expenses 2.) Acquisition of Kona Entertainment Vehicles and carts 3.) Sponsoring events for underprivileged children and families 4.) Extremely cost efficient budget of keynote speakers, celebrities, and additional travel and expense costs to promote education in our community in our schools.</p>
<p>Our devotion brings well known celebrities, national keynote speakers, academic scholars, and successful entrepreneurs to speak at elementary schools to universities like UNLV. Our goal is to inspire our younger generations to pursue higher education in the university systems, find their ambitions, and invest in our human capital. We have done this with a shoe string budget and relationships built in the national community while still maintaining profitability. We have over 100+ people in the community help volunteer with us as we run as a hybrid of a volunteer non-profit, grassroots organizing campaign, and for profit entrepreneurial venture with social responsibility. We have a very sustainable business model that has a 100% successfully proven track record for over 200 franchisees across the entire U.S. since our inception in 2007.</p>
<p>By partnering with the private sector and non-profits, we have created an open platform for businesses to adopt social responsibility and philanthropy. We, the community, believe that if we can converge all our partners together it will eventually lead to solidarity and strengthen community building in Southern Nevada via a horizontal and vertical community integration platform. Hence, the concept of paying it forward to others.</p>

<p>We have also built an entrepreneurial mentoring program within Kona Ice Las Vegas and Henderson to help aspiring business owners learn the fundamentals of building a nationwide company. Coming from a background of working with Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies, we have advised executive directors / senior management of non-profits, start-ups, and small businesses learn best practices in sales methodologies, operational strategies, brand promotion, value propositions, and building a roadmap to success.</p>
<p>What if you can invest into charity via a hybrid of venture philanthropy? What if you can help multiple charites instead of just one? Or build the infrastructure for non-profit fundraising? What if you can invest in education for our future generations? Your contributions changes the lives of many as we have heavily invested into the community. Since we donate 20% of our top line sales revenue, the GREATEST thing is that it is a recurring donation so it is the GIFT that just KEEPS GIVING.</p>
<h3><strong>If you are a business / company, show your support for all our schools, sports leagues, non-profits, churches, and gain exposure to hundreds of thousands by our social responsibility co-branding.

In addition, learn how our World Changing Humanitarian and other options can benefit from our partnerships.

<br/><h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>There is a treasure, a literal oasis in the arid convergence of the Mojave Desert, the Colorado Plateau, and the Great Basin geological zones.  Water sources that have fed our hometown for generations. First impacted by the construction of the I-15 freeway in the 1960's, these sites began a marked decline over the ensuing decades.  Once places of community gathering and innocent recreation, these sites have been neglected and polluted. They have been closed down from public access, but continue to be trespassed upon and have a reputation for vagrancy, drug use, and obvious vandalization.</p>
<p>We have been struck with a profound sense of the potential of these sites to be restored as a spaces of beauty and productivity.  Our intent is to create a place for the local and international community to connect.  A place that people are attracted to because of the intrinsic beauty, rich history, educational opportunities, and breath taking artistic displays.</p>
<p>These sites, known as The Boilers &amp; Millcreek, have been important to our community historically,  They continue to provide an important source of fresh water to the residents of Southern Utah.  They are home to a diverse range of plants &amp; wildlife and also boast Native American ruins and petroglyphs.  We plan to create gardens, a conservatory, and trail system to restore honor &amp; beauty to what has been damaged, defaced, and almost forgotten.<br/></p>
<p>Two years ago our group began researching in earnest the possibility of creating a public botanical garden which lead us to the American Public Garden Association's National Convention. It was hosted by Franklin Gardens in Columbus, Ohio. Our eyes were opened to the way a public garden can transform a community. Subsequent visits to the Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburg gave us the opportunity to engage with the staff of the conservatory and we were further energized to see leadership in sustainable building and technology. We knew this was a pattern for what we wanted to bring to our hometown...and we have a plan.</p>
<p>The Boiling Springs Ecoseum &amp; Desert Preserve was born.  It is a non-profit entity created in 2012 to address the ecological concerns of The Boilers &amp; Millcreek Canyon in Washington, Utah.   </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>From every
angle, the Boiling Springs Ecoseum &amp; Desert Preserve is a learning environment. Far more than a
public garden, The Ecoseum will serve as a center for teaching, learning, and
research.  Visitors from around the world
will be immersed in the cultural heritage as well as the unique natural history
of Southern Utah.  Moreover, the very
infrastructure of the facilities will serve as a functional example of the most
advanced applications of technology, engineering, architecture, and environmentally
sustainable practices. As our world faces increasingly more complex challenges, The Ecoseum will represent the potential of human ingenuity and technological
promise.</p>
<p>Our region is known the world over for its National Parks and boasts an impressive annual eco-tourism tally.  We find this presents a wonderful opportunity for our local and international community to leave an indelible impression on one another.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Starting a small business is such a leap of faith.  Our internet business turned from a fun hobby in to a full-fledged option for a career, and we decided to branch out into not only a retail location, but a fully functioning art studio where the community can come and learn to re-purpose and refinish their own furniture. </p>
<p>We searched for over a year, and found the perfect space. Perfect in theory, that is!  It had terrible termite damage, uneven concrete floors, mold, peeling paint...you get the idea! Not afraid of hard work, we jumped right in, working 12 hour days, sometime more.  Our ""Grand Opening"" was on track for November 1st. </p>
<p>With less than two weeks to go, one half of Stiltskin Studios, Kenny, was in a motorcycle accident.  With a hospital stay, broken bones, and a lengthy recovery time, we contemplated throwing in the towel, but as the proverbial ""they"" say, if it was easy ,everyone would be doing it. We made the commitment to somehow make it happen. </p>
<p>Part retail space, part art studio...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal was initially just to figure out how to get our doors open, but we've raised enough capital for that.  Our new goal? To pay it forward by way of free art classes for kids...we want to bring that creative spark, the beauty of creating something, to the kids that might never get the experience.</p>
<p>What's in it for us?  Extra product, brushes, and supplies to be able to offer children's classes at no cost.</p>
<p>What's in it for you?  We can't offer jaw-dropping perks, sorry!  If we could, we wouldn't be here raising funds!  What we CAN offer is exposure...if you are a business owner, we can promote your business on our blog (<a href=""http://www.stiltskinstudios.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stiltskinstudios.blogspot.com</a>) and on our FaceBook page.</p>
<p>If you're local, we're offering a mini-class on furniture painting, or we'll credit your contribution amount toward any class, products, etc.</p>
<p>Not local?  You can apply your contribution towards a purchase in our Etsy shop.</p>
<p>  Of course, you'll also get the satisfaction of enabling us the chance to pay it forward!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our business is located in historic downtown Tarpon Springs.  Our street recently underwent a dramatic transformation from dilapidated and desperate to adorable...brick streets, new awnings, antique iron street lights and benches...it's lovely.  But the foot traffic just isn't there yet.  Other small businesses on our street are struggling.  Our long-term goal is to turn Hibiscus Street into DESTINATION shopping...and our business attracts destination shoppers. We're proud to be able to contribute to the rebirth of this ""Main Street"" in our community, and we aren't willing to let go because of a temporary, if major, setback. </p>

<h1>The Story</h1>
<p>I suppose you could say it started the same way just about everything does. With a girl. A girl in the tropics with sensitive skin that was forever in a state of itchiness and dryness. Fearing a severe skin condition, she visited her doctor and told him all about the problems she'd been having. The doctor asked several questions, but no solution was obvious or forthcoming. </p>
<p>The girl went on with her daily activities, which on this particular day meant a trip to the grocery store. Casually filling her basket with daily essentials, she noticed that her commercial soap of choice had new packaging. Studying the new packaging lead to the startling realization that she couldn't <i>pronounce</i> most of the ingredients on the label. That girl, of course... was my wife.</p>
<p>With that, an idea was born. Simply made, 100% all natural soap. Free from chemical additives and preservatives. Cruelty free. Vegan friendly. People friendly. Safe. </p>
<h1>Our Products</h1>
<p>Commercially made ""soap"" isn't actually soap at all. It consists entirely of artificial detergents, fillers, chemicals, petroleum, high animal fat content (read: sodium tallowate) and irritants like SLS or SLES (sulfates) that are harmful to people, animals,<i>and</i> the environment. They are not put in the product to improve its quality, but rather to prolong its shelf life. </p>
<p>Our naturally made tropical soaps are made with this simple formula:</p>
<p><b>Oils + Butters + Lye = Soap</b></p>
<p>Living in the tropics for 7 years has given us great insight into another culture. Watching locals prepare handmade soaps and body care products (and testing them out, of course) has taught me one important thing. <i>We're doing soap all wrong.</i></p>
<p>The first step towards incredible body treatments is to find the freshest and safest ingredients. My time abroad has allowed me the opportunity to cultivate relationships with the growers and purveyors of fresh fruit, vegetables and other plants that allow for the creation of the best handmade products around.</p>
<p>We use the highest quality fruit and vegetable based oils, butters and essences to produce a superior quality, luxuriously lathery soap. Nothing unnatural ever has, or will ever be added. The glycerin usually taken out of commercial soaps is left where it belongs in our soaps, which makes for a more moisturizing and nourishing cleansing experience.</p>
<p>We currently offer soaps with a great selection exfoliating tropical ingredients and an array of tropical scents that are sure to please the olfactory senses. Each product we make is lovingly hand crafted in small batches with each ingredient being 100% cruelty free. Our palm oils for example, are sourced from growers and processors who are members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).</p>
<p>Each one of our soaps are between 3.5 ounces (100 grams) and 4.2 ounces (120 grams) depending on the ingredients and the exfoliating agent used. They are also available in larger loaf forms or bulk units, allowing you to decide exactly how big you want your bars and to reduce cost. </p>
<p>Each tropical soap variety we offer comes in several different all natural scents made from pure fruit, vegetable, and plant oils. Some of our soaps contain great exfoliating agents such as oats, lemon rinds, poppy seeds, chamomile tea, green tea, aloe vera and freshly ground coffee. For a list of our most frequently asked for scents and exfoliating ingredients, don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>We are also in the development stages of a line of tropical bath bombs and lip balms, made from the same high quality ingredients that make our fragrant and natural soap line so popular.</p>
<h1>Where The Funds Go</h1>
<p>The funds obtained through this project will be used to order the highest quality ingredients we can find. Many are USDA approved organic oils and butters, some are RSPO members, and all are vegan friendly and cruelty free. While our soaps currently use the exact same ingredients, they are costly to produce when buying in limited quantities. Some such bulk items cost in excess of $400/unit which makes moving forward without your support an impossibility. Purchasing ingredients in bulk will allow us the opportunity to reduce the price of our products by more than 50%, and expand the current business. Additionally, some of the funds will be used to purchase stronger curing racks and additional molds and cutters.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Indiegogo, You Say?</h1>
<p>Indiegogo is a website that allows creative people to reach out to their friends, family, neighbors, and prospective customers the world over in order to help get ideas off the ground. Whether it's a musician pressing a new album, an inventor looking to fund a first production run, or an all natural hand made soap making company, each creator sets a goal to reach. If the total pledges don't reach the goal, then <i><b>the project is not funded at all.</b></i> The pledges aren't an investment in the business in that you don't get a share of the company. This fundraiser is just for the creation of our great line of products. </p>
<p>Note: If we don't get 100% funded, we get nothing! None of the pledges come out of your accounts until we reach 100%, so please help us spread the word about our great 100% all natural soap! </p>
<p>1. Create an Indiegogo account! All you'll need is an email address. </p>
<p>2. Sign in if you already have an account, you're all set. If not it only takes a moment. </p>
<p> 3. Pledge what you are comfortable giving. We appreciate every dollar. If you find yourself wanting to help but unable to donate you can skip to the next step to help us spread the word. Your card will only be charged should we reach our full goal. </p>
<p> 4. SHARE this with your friends, family, coworkers, neighbors, and whoever else crosses your path!</p>

It was close to the Trilogy Skate Park &amp; convenient to neighboring cities. We have been open for only a couple of months now &amp; are fast approaching our first winter season. We need help raising funds to order the inventory necessary to make it a successful snow season. As you can imagine, ordering boots, coats, &amp; snowboards by the dozens is very expensive!

<div>The donations we receive will be used to purchase snowboards, boots, snowboarding coats &amp; pants, hats, goggles, apparel, accessories, fixtures, &amp; advertising.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The success of Inertia is critical to our community for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>       5.   Our sons are learning the value of hard work &amp; responsibility.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>If we are unable to reach our funding goal, we will not be able to provide our customers with the product they have already been requesting. This, in turn, will result in less money to be able to order our inventory for the following spring. It will create a financial ""snowball effect"" if we can't get started with the inventory we need.</p>

  Risks & Challenges If we are unable to reach our funding goal, we will not be able to provide our customers with the product they have already been requesting. This, in turn, will result in less money to be able to order our inventory for the following spring. It will create a financial ""snowball effect"" if we can't get started with the inventory we need.

<p><b>WHO WE ARE</b></p>
<p>Arrupe Karuna Welcome
Center is a foster home for children and young people with disabilities who
come from poor families. Our main goal is the integration and empowerment
of these boys and girls who are physically disabled through formal education,
employment opportunities and instilling positive values and attitudes. The
youngsters supported by the center either attend school, university or
vocational training centers. </p>
<p>There are 48 boys and
girls with disabilities living in Arrupe Welcome Center, and 20 members of
staff, also physically disabled, who take care of the maintenance and
management of the center and its various activities. In addition to the
education the students receive the center organizes academic extra classes (to
complement what they study at school), English classes, computer classes,
agriculture workshops, traditional Khmer dancing classes, and tennis classes and
other sports.</p>
<p>The center also
assists the students' and employees' families by providing them with
micro-loans, household construction, health infrastructure and food security
services.</p>
<p>The students and staff
suffer from different kinds of physical disabilities, many of them being Land
Mine, Cluster Munitions and other Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) amputees. We
are fully committed to the ""Ban Land Mines and Cluster Munitions""
cause. In previous occasions, we have organized other events to promote
Awareness Campaigns, such as “Push for Progress” (2011) and ""Make it
Happen” (2012).</p>
<p><b>GOAL OF THE CAMPAIGN</b></p>
<p>Students from Arrupe Welcome
Center want to send an <b>inspirational message of courage and determination</b> to
those who suffer, as well as <b>demand the Government of Cambodia</b>, and many other
countries, to <b>join the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM)</b>. We plan to
achieve this goal by implementing an <b>awareness campaign</b> in which we aim to
<b>generate consciousness</b> among people from different countries about Land
Mine and Cluster Munitions issues.</p>
<p>This campaign is promoted in coordination with the <b>International Campaign to Ban Land Mines (ICBL)</b>,
the <b>Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC)</b>, the <b>Jesuit Refugee
Service (JRS)</b> and other international and local associations, leading
NGOs in this field.</p>

<p><b>THE SCENARIO </b></p>
<p><b>Angkor Wat
Half-Marathon, December 7th, 2014</b></p>
<p>The main action of our
campaign will be to participate in the Angkor Wat Half-Marathon event promoting
our message “We run to ban Cluster Munitions”. At the time this event takes
place (December 7<sup>th</sup> 2014) we will have already started our
awareness campaign and contacted many friends and participants who will support
our cause.</p>
<p>A team of 45 students
with disabilities from Arrupe Welcome Center will join the marathon “Run to Bun
Cluster munitions” supporting the campaign. </p>
<p>A large number of
T-shits, bands and other promotional materials will be distributed starting
from the week before the event and finishing on December 7<sup>th</sup> in Siem Reap. We
attempt to display a stand from where we could hand out our giveaways and
promotional information (flyers and cards, flags…)</p>
<p>The Angkor Wat Half-Marathon
is the perfect scenario from where to share our message:</p>
<p>· It will
be attended by more than 6,000 participants coming from over 50 different
countries</p>
<p>· Local
Governmental Authorities will also join this important event</p>
<p>· The race
will be covered by a variety of local and international televisions and media
companies</p>
<p>· The event is organized by a non-profit
organization, who has showed its commitment to the cause of land mines and
cluster munitions since its first edition, in 1996</p>
<p><b>WHAT ARE CLUSTER MUNITIONS?</b></p>
<p>Cluster munitions pose
significant danger to civilians for two principal reasons: their impact at the
time of use and their deadly legacy. Launched from the ground or dropped from
the air, <b>cluster munitions consist of containers that open and disperse
submunitions indiscriminately over a wide area</b>, <b>claiming both
civilian and military victims.</b> Many explosive submunitions, also known
as bomblets, fail to detonate as designed when they are dispersed, becoming
defacto landmines that kill and maim indiscriminately long after the conflict
has ended and create barriers to socio-economic development.</p>
<p>To prevent civilians
from the effects of cluster munitions, Norway and other like-minded countries
initiated a fast-track diplomatic process in 2007 aimed at creating a new
international treaty. Working in partnership with UN agencies, the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and civil society grouped under
the Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC), the Oslo Process resulted in the adoption
in May 2008 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM).</p>
<p>After 20 states
ratified, the Convention on Cluster Munitions entered into force on August
2010. It prohibits the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster
munitions. The convention also requires destruction of stockpiled cluster
munitions within eight years, clearance of cluster munition remnants within 10
years, and assistance to victims, including those killed or injured by
submunitions as well as their families and affected communities.</p>
<p><b>CAMBODIA AND CLUSTER
MUNITIONS</b></p>
<p>Cambodia has estimated
a contamination of Cluster Munition covering at least 489km2 of land.
Particularly its eastern and northeastern areas, bordering Lao PDR and Vietnam,
are affected by between 1.9 million and 5.8 million cluster munition remnants
as a result of US aircraft dropping approximately 26 million explosive
submunitions in Cambodia during the Vietnam War. In February 2011, Thailand’s
use of cluster munitions in Cambodia’s northern province, Preah Vihear, resulted
in additional submunition contamination over an area of approximately 1.5km2.</p>
<p>Cambodia is also one
of the six countries “considered to have the largest number of cluster munition
victims, with the challenge of the responsibility to address the needs of
several thousands of survivors.” Despite not having yet joined the convention,
Cambodia has recognized the need for victim assistance and has provided
information to Convention on Cluster Munition States Parties on their efforts
in this regard. Cambodia has reported on their implementation efforts in
accordance with the convention’s specific requirements of planning,
coordination and the integration of victim assistance into rights-based
frameworks. (Statement of Cambodia, Convention on Cluster Munitions Third
Meeting of States Parties, Oslo, 12 September 2012) However, Cambodia has not
yet joined the Cluster Munition Convention (CMC) nor signed the Convention on
Cluster Munitions (CCM).</p>
<p>According to a review
by Handicap International (HI) of US bombing data, approximately 80,000 cluster
munitions, containing 26 million submunitions, were dropped on Cambodia
(1969–1973) and more than 414,000 cluster bombs, containing at least 260
million submunitions, were dropped on Lao PDR (1965–1973).</p>
<p>Cluster munition
remnants in Cambodia include unexploded BLU-24, BLU-26, BLU-36, BLU-42, BLU-43,
BLU-49, BLU-61, M42, M46, and M85 sub- munitions.55 As of April 2013, an
ongoing baseline survey (BLS) identified 990 suspected cluster munition-contaminated
areas covering an area of 489.23km2, particularly in southeastern Kratie
province bordering Vietnam, northeastern Stung Treng province and northern
Preah Vihear province. This figure is likely to rise as a result of survey of
additional areas.</p></div>","WHO WE ARE

<p>Why do I persist?  The short answer is that it's my nature.  I am determined to prove--to myself as well as to others--that you can build something from nothing.</p>
<p>So here I am again, trying to start a business.  This time it's an online coffee company called Cafe Soul Coffee.  (See <a href=""http://cafesoulcoffee.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cafe Soul Coffee</a>).  What's different about Cafe Soul coffee, compared with all the other businesses I started, is that I'm not looking to make a whole lot of money to satisfy a bunch of investors or to get rich.  No, this time it's different:  This time I will be happy to raise only $6,000 -- $5,300 of which would  buy a coffee roasting machine, while the rest would purchase coffee beans and other supplies.  The beans will be purchased mostly from Fair Trade coffee growers in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
<p>I think I will be successful in business this time around because I have a feeling that a lot of you will want me to succeed, not so much to satisfy my ego, but because when I succeed, I can make a lot of speeches before young kids in the inner cities, where I grew up, about the virtue of perseverance and what it means in building character, as well as what it says about people sharing their resources-- whether its money, talent, or simply an idea--to realize a common goal.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">In practical terms, I need to purchase a coffee roasting machine to create volume.  I can't penny pinch my way to success.  I'm too old for that.  To be successful in this business, I will need to sell to large grocery chains as well as to individual coffee </span>aficionados.  I need to build brand loyalty.  A coffee roasting machine, or two or three, will help enormously, as opposed to the way I have been doing it by filling orders one at a time, as they come in.  I've gone over the figures a zillion times, and $6,000 will get me started.  I can make it from there.  As the business grows, I will buy extra machines, move from my basement location, and hire workers.</div>
<div><h3>Perks?</h3></div>
<div>For people who give from $25-$99, I will add your name to a page on our website as a valued donor.  For people who donate $100-$500, in addition to adding your name to our donors' page, I will send you a half-pound of the coffee of your choice each month for a year.  For people who donate $1,000 or more, I will name you as ""patron"" of Cafe Soul Coffee co., as well as send you a pound of coffee of your choice monthly for two years.  In addition, you will be sent a coffee mug, with the Cafe Soul logo on it, indicating your patron status.</div>
<div>Finally, if I fail to reach my goal this time, and depending on how far I fall short, I will donate all of the funds raised to Museum Africa, a 501 (c )(3) nonprofit I founded a few years ago to raise consciousness about the enormous contributions that ancient Africans made to world civilizations.</div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In a year or so, if I am successful, I can begin telling the world how Indiegogo contributions helped create jobs--however few--in depressed neighborhoods.  I can go on talk shows and talk about grass root efforts of people helping people succeed.  I can write opt-ed pieces in local newspapers and make speeches before community groups extolling the virtues of people working together for a common good.  Perhaps my example can inspire others to form businesses in their neighborhoods.  Cafe Soul Coffee Company can lead to the creation of Starbucks-style coffee shops all across the world, as well as food companies that sell products other than coffee.  My success might also inspire out-of-work people to form co-ops and grow their own vegetables and herbs and sell them at local farmers' markets.  I, for one, will preach that.  The potential is enormous.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks are minimal.  For one thing, I will be proactive and pursue contracts and account receivable orders from large grocery chains for, say, delivering as much as 1,000 pounds of coffee each month.  This strategy eliminates the risk of storing huge inventories of coffee beans.  We will sell on demand.  </p>
<p>At the same time, this strategy has the potential of creating dozens of jobs in depressed neighborhoods.  Truckers, roasters, salespeople, office workers can be hired.  </p>
<p>The challenge will be to convince the chains to accept our product.  To overcome that challenge, I will appeal to the social-conscious efforts that they and other like-minded corporations are making or have made.  </p>

<p>The key market segments for
vacation rentals are described more fully below: </p>
<p><strong>Young Couples:</strong> Aged 21 to 39, young couples without children look for romantic
getaways as well as high-energy activities (ski boats, beaches, hiking, diving,
etc.). While some may be wealthy enough to rent a luxurious vacation home with
all the extras, many have to stretch to rent a basic vacation home. It is more
difficult for these young couples to put together a group large enough to
afford a large vacation home, but they may be able to use smaller vacation home
with fewer amenities. </p>
<p><strong>Older Couples:</strong> Aged 40 and up, although some within this age bracket will still
be very active and self-identify with young couples, older couples without
children look for romance and relaxation. They seek quieter activities such as
fishing, light hiking, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Families:</strong> Couples or individuals with children. They require a mix of
relaxation for parents and high-energy activities for children. They may also
require creature comforts for the children, such as entertainment centers,
which couples can do without on a vacation. </p>

This year, it happens to be in Victoria. The opportunity to showcase our local talent on the national stage is a big one. So is the cost of sending, housing and feeding 5 poets for 6 days. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So we're calling on our community to help us get there!</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We need $5,550 total for this trip to cover travel, modest accommodation and food for 5 team members for the 6 days of the festival. This campaign, which aims to raise $1500, will supplement our other fundraising efforts including fundraiser events, performance fees, and a travel grant. </p>
<p>In exchange for your contributions, we're offering some pretty deadly perks, including snow shovelling, banana bread, private yoga classes, an acoustic song written just for you, and a 3-course home-cooked meal served up by us!

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Word Up is one of the youngest slams in the country. We've got some incredible talent emerging from this freshly tilled prairie soil, and connecting with the national spoken word community is key to our growth as individual poets and as a community.</p>
<p>Despite being pretty fresh, Word Up has quickly become a popular hub for spoken word in Regina. The Slam Team has been invited to perform at events such as the Cathedral Village Arts Festival, Vertigo Series, and Saskatoon's Tonight It's Poetry. </p>
<p>The Canadian Festival of Spoken Word is the only national team poetry competition in the country. It offers an annual opportunity for poets to come together to challenge themselves and each other through playful competition. It sounds intense, but really it's a big love fest. In its first two years at the festival, Regina has been welcomed with wide open, poet-sized hearts and enthusiasm. </p>
<p>Your contribution will connect you with a quickly growing local community of people who are passionate about the power and beauty of spoken word.

</b><p>Dear
Friends of Nico Farms,</p>
<p>We
must share with you the humbling reality of our situation.</p>
<p>While
we have vigorously invested in the farm, from our blood, sweat, &amp; tears, to
our hearts, minds, and souls, we are suffering from the fact that our
recent efforts were too little too late.<span> 
And the reality seems to be that we are at our end before we really even
got enough of a start.  It is painful
that we must deal with the fact that we have exhausted our financial resources.  </span></p>
<p>There
was nothing, then came ideas, hopes, &amp; dreams.<span>  We came together to create Nico Farms.  While we were severely underfunded from the
start, we frugally stretched a “shoe-string budget” into a “dental-floss
budget,” and managed to get through our first year.</span></p>
<p>Realistically,
it takes a lot of endurance and resourcefulness to grow a start-up though the
long journey to sustainability.<span>  We have the will, but not the financial means.  Thus, without the lottery win or an extremely successful Indiegogo campaign, we
have to bid farewell sooner than much of our community got a chance to discover
us.</span></p>
<p>We
are grateful for the privilege of being able to help Central Coast Grown break
ground at City Farm – San Luis Obispo on the Calle Joaquin Agricultural Reserve.<span>  We are grateful for many
supportive people and local businesses. </span></p>
<p>Bless
you all and have a happy new year.</p>
<p>Thank
you all sincerely,</p><p>Nicola
Allegretta<span>  a.k.a.  Nico</span></p>

**************************************************************************<br/>ABOUT NICO FARMS<br/>Nico Farms was started in San Luis Obispo, California in 2014 by local chef, Nicola 
Allegretta.  Nicola wanted to truly practice farm-to-table for his restaurant, Mama's Meatball in The Creamery downtown, where his family runs the kitchen.  <br/><br/>See more of Chef Nicola, and hear about the restaurant and the farm!<br/>Watch our new video!<br/><a href=""http://studio.smartshoot.com/preview_room/view/137784/98081"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://studio.smartshoot.com/preview_room/view/137784/98081</a><br/><br/>With the farm location in the heart of San Luis 
Obispo, we are positioned to greatly increase farm-to-table practices 
throughout the community.  We share the value of local food production 
and know our success 
depends on the support of the community.  Our growing practices have not
 included the use of pesticides, and we hope to begin the process of

Dear
Friends of Nico Farms,
We
must share with you the humbling reality of our situation.
While
we have vigorously invested in the farm, from our blood, sweat, & tears, to
our hearts, minds, and souls, we are suffering from the fact that our
recent efforts were too little too late. 
And the reality seems to be that we are at our end before we really even
got enough of a start.  It is painful
that we must deal with the fact that we have exhausted our financial resources.  
There
was nothing, then came ideas, hopes, & dreams.  We came together to create Nico Farms.  While we were severely underfunded from the
start, we frugally stretched a “shoe-string budget” into a “dental-floss
budget,” and managed to get through our first year.
Realistically,
it takes a lot of endurance and resourcefulness to grow a start-up though the
long journey to sustainability.  We have the will, but not the financial means.  Thus, without the lottery win or an extremely successful Indiegogo campaign, we
have to bid farewell sooner than much of our community got a chance to discover
us.
We
are grateful for the privilege of being able to help Central Coast Grown break
ground at City Farm – San Luis Obispo on the Calle Joaquin Agricultural Reserve.  We are grateful for many
supportive people and local businesses. 
Bless
you all and have a happy new year.
Thank
you all sincerely,Nicola
Allegretta  a.k.a.  Nico

**************************************************************************ABOUT NICO FARMSNico Farms was started in San Luis Obispo, California in 2014 by local chef, Nicola 
Allegretta.  Nicola wanted to truly practice farm-to-table for his restaurant, Mama's Meatball in The Creamery downtown, where his family runs the kitchen.  See more of Chef Nicola, and hear about the restaurant and the farm!Watch our new video!http://studio.smartshoot.com/preview_room/view/137784/98081With the farm location in the heart of San Luis 
Obispo, we are positioned to greatly increase farm-to-table practices 
throughout the community.  We share the value of local food production 
and know our success 
depends on the support of the community.  Our growing practices have not
 included the use of pesticides, and we hope to begin the process of 
organic certification soon.  We are proud to grow food for our local 
community, with diverse seasonal varieties that are grown safely for a 
healthier lifestyle choice.  Below, you will learn more about us and see some of our happy customers ... There really is a Mama at Mama's Meatball, and the menu comes from her own recipes.

Mama has been making marinara sauce from our tomatoes, and selling her sauce at 55 Fresh Farmer's Market in Pismo Beach and The Grange Farmer's Market in San Luis Obispo.http://www.55fresh.com/https://www.facebook.com/SloGrangeTuesdayFarmer...

</p><p><strong>The Concept</strong></p>
<p>A private charitable foundation “powered” by real estate investments, supporting Vermont children and families through small micro-grants that enhance wellbeing and support a shift toward self-sufficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p><em>I can make one unequivocal statement about my experience: what we are doing is not working.  There are individual successes among countless failures.  The human service system is in dire need of an innovative approach to social change.</em></p>
<p><em>After years of observation and planning, I believe I have the solution.</em></p>
<p><em>A foundation that is funded in a sustainable and dependable way, that delivers effective, efficient and responsive supports to children and families.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>The Children's Foundation is in the concept phase, looking for support to obtain 501(c)(3) nonprofit status with the IRS.  With these funds, we will also create a website, logo, promotional materials and most importantly, a fund development plan that will take us to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>Copies of receipts for each purchase will be posted on this page after the campaign has closed.</strong>  We have elected to accept all funds, even if we don't reach our goal. So every donation is helpful!</p>
<p>We are requesting funding for the following expenses:</p>
<p>$75 - Domain name, hosting</p>
<p>$75 - Vermont Nonprofit Corporation filing fee</p>
<p>$850 - IRS 501(c)(3) application fee</p>
<p>$1,200 - Legal support for IRS application*</p>
<p>$1,000 - Branding and marketing materials, logo, website customization</p>
<p>$1,800 - Technology, office supplies and other startup expenses</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>$5,000</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>The Vermont Children's Foundation (VCF) is a unique organization aimed at achieving a singular outcome: to impact social justice by leveraging sustainable assets and community strengths.  The typical nonprofit determines what service it will provide and then pursues funding to support this work.  The VCF strategy is atypical in that it builds sustainable assets in the form of real estate investments, and then determines the reach and depth of the work that is possible.  By building a portfolio of real estate investments, the VCF will be sustainably funded, without the constraints of state or Federal funding.</p>
<p>The VCF was conceived by a social worker that was frustrated by the bureaucracy of ""the system"" and envisioned a new way of helping the community.  The Foundation will provide unencumbered support to children and families in the form of micro-grants.  These grants can be used to pay for services or activities that enhance the wellbeing of the child and are not funded through conventional channels.  After the Foundation is well established, it may expand to offer social casework or other direct services for children and families that do not qualify for these services through traditional channels.</p>
<p><strong>What comes next</strong></p>
<p>After the Indiegogo community helps us start the foundation and obtain 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, we will begin an aggressive fundraising campaign to purchase our first real estate.  It will snowball from there.  If things go well, we may be back here soon!</p>

</ul><p></p></div>","The Concept
A private charitable foundation “powered” by real estate investments, supporting Vermont children and families through small micro-grants that enhance wellbeing and support a shift toward self-sufficiency.
Who We Are
I can make one unequivocal statement about my experience: what we are doing is not working.  There are individual successes among countless failures.  The human service system is in dire need of an innovative approach to social change.
After years of observation and planning, I believe I have the solution.
A foundation that is funded in a sustainable and dependable way, that delivers effective, efficient and responsive supports to children and families.

What we need
The Children's Foundation is in the concept phase, looking for support to obtain 501(c)(3) nonprofit status with the IRS.  With these funds, we will also create a website, logo, promotional materials and most importantly, a fund development plan that will take us to the next stage.
Copies of receipts for each purchase will be posted on this page after the campaign has closed.  We have elected to accept all funds, even if we don't reach our goal. So every donation is helpful!
We are requesting funding for the following expenses:
$75 - Domain name, hosting
$75 - Vermont Nonprofit Corporation filing fee
$850 - IRS 501(c)(3) application fee
$1,200 - Legal support for IRS application*
$1,000 - Branding and marketing materials, logo, website customization
$1,800 - Technology, office supplies and other startup expenses
-----------
$5,000

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For those of you who have been following our progress as we get ready to open know it's taken a long time. Well we are down to the home stretch. We have about two weeks worth of work to finish then we can finish the permit process. The permit process should only take about a week. The problem we have is we are running out of money to finish the work and to get caught up on our rent. This campaign is to pay the rent and finish the construction work so we can move forward and be open by March 1. We hope you can help us and if you do, we will provide a special 'perk' as a thank you.<img alt=""Bakery Floor"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/48203_520153234681437_1523682824_o.jpg"" dir=""ltr"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-top;""/></p>
<p>My name is Domenic Ciolino, I come from a Sicilian family where Italian deserts are just as important as the meal. I want to share the joy of great Italian baked goods like Cannoli, Rum Cake and unbelievably delicious cookies and pastries. After Sunday dinner, my whole family would sit around the table talking and catching up on each other's families and what the kids are doing. There was always coffee and home made Italian cookies and pastries on the table and the kids were not far away when the pastries came out. </p>
<p>Italian pastry is also a great gift when you go visiting friends. Just think about it, having coffee, sitting with family or friends, laughing, talking and enjoying a nice Ricotta pie or other Italian pastry, cake or cookies.  I have spent the last six months getting the bakery ready just so my customers can share the same experience. Now we need your help.</p>
<p>If we don't raise this money by February 8th, we may not be able to open.</p>
<p>I'm asking for your help to get this bakery, New Hampshire's only Italian Bakery, open for March 1, 2013.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Basically, we need to finish the small details that will complete our remodel and construction.</p>
<p>We have some great perks for you too. There are different perks for different amounts of money you can commit. But no matter how much you decide to send our way, I guarantee, you won't be disapointed. And to protect your investment, if we don't open on March 1st, then you can get your money back. Of course we will still honor special orders  and you can still place your special orders online. <img alt=""Three Cannoli"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/394380_431308420255075_1746703340_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Cannoli""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Once we open, we will employ 15 people. And, when we are in full gear in a few months, we will employ over 35 people. And by purchasing from local busineses, we will help employ even more. And even better than that, You and thousands of other New Hampshire residents will have an Italian Bakery they can call their own. Just like the bakeries in Boston's North End, we will have all the favorite Italian pastries, cakes, pies and cookies. But we can't do it without your help. Please take a look at each of the options and the perks, what ever you can do to help us will be greatly appreciated. Once we are open, we hope to see you in the bakery for an espresso and we'd love to show you around to see our operation.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Sara Johnson and I am the founder of The Homegrown Home. This business has developed from the frustration of going to stores to find most of our goods being made outside of the United States.</p>

<p>
    SoonEnuf is a multifunctional site that will establish a simple, yet engaging environment for same-sex couples to raise money from family, friends and even
    strangers to help ease the cost of their wedding expenses. A secondary function of the site (yet highly central to the overall goal I’m pushing to
    accomplish) is to act as a tool to break down the impersonal and polarizing façade that forms around highly publicized and controversial topics (in this
    case, same-sex marriage). By providing a more intimate, first-hand interaction with real people, their interests and experiences, and how they are/will be
    personally affected by the outcomes of the current battle for marriage equality, a dialogue suddenly emerges. By utilizing this dialogue while removing
    constant talk of impersonal aspects like legal battles, protests, petitions, etc… SoonEnuf, the LGBT community and any supporters can accelerate the trend
    of growing support for marriage equality (and other LGBT issues) among everyday people.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond these goals, the site will have other features to assist and support various aspects of the LGBT community and its supporters with their own
    ventures and endeavors. A particularly useful feature for both couples and businesses that cater to any of the needs associated with planning a wedding
    (especially those who specialize in the particular needs associated with same-sex weddings) is highlighted in our “Wedding Planner” perk. Every Couple who
    sets up a SoonEnuf campaign will be personally provided with a detailed list of businesses (along with contact information and services provided) within a
    75 mile radius of their location that provides wedding-related services. Keep reading below to learn more about SoonEnuf, as well as our long list of
    awesome perks, who I am, more great features the site will offer and the multitude of ways in which SoonEnuf will benefit the LGBT community and its
    supporters!

<p></p>
<p>
    My name is Ragin Mickens and I’m the founder of SoonEnuf. I’m currently an undergrad student studying civil engineering at the University at Buffalo in
    Buffalo, NY. SoonEnuf is the culmination of my own experiences throughout my past 3 years in college. The idea behind it all actually grew from my desire
    to find a unique and effective way to boost the confidence and self-esteem of ‘in the closet’ LGBT people. I came out to my mom during my last few months
    of high school and the results were… let’s just say pretty disastrous. A big reason I was able to make it through my final months living with my mother was
    because I have a pretty strong and confident personality. Unfortunately, MANY LGBT people (and especially youth) can’t say the same and sadly, lots of them
    go as far as ending their own life to escape the torment they constantly live with. Knowing this, ever since I came out I’ve felt it’s been a personal
    responsibility of mine to ALWAYS speak up against ignorant and demeaning remarks towards LGBT individuals and the community at large. More importantly,
    I’ve always made sure to really explain how such remarks can really damage other people, while still remaining an open-book of sorts to those around me
    with questions about being gay. As a result, I’ve actually changed perspectives and decreased ignorance amongst most (if not all) of my friends and how
    they view the LGBT community. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">                                                                          </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">                             </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/22039/files/20130819153606-What_LGBT_is_Lacking.JPG?1376951766"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>
<p>
    I recently came to the realization that there’s a severe imbalance in the current approach to create a better life for LGBT individuals. The bulk of this
    approach is focused on either pushing for new laws that promote LGBT equality or trying to increase the confidence and self-esteem of LGBT individuals
    (especially youth). These are both ESSENTIAL to a better life for the LGBT community but they don’t really solve the core issue that spawns the needs for
    these approaches in the first place. That issue is simply the ignorance of many of those who aren’t a part of the LGBT community. Their ignorance (and the
    harmful habits that usually accompany it) is what keeps many LGBT individuals living in fear of revealing their sexual orientation to others. This lack of
    understanding and association is also at the core of why there are so many opponents to marriage equality and other LGBT issues. Obviously we need all the
    protests, rallies and legal suits to really push for equality, but the most effective way to win the overall battle is to change people’s minds and
    perspectives. The best way to do this is to simply let others see the more personal, intimate side of the issue; this is what SoonEnuf will do.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>                                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/22052/files/20130819154902-Impact.JPG?1376952542"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
    Although the main and most visible feature of SoonEnuf will be its use as a way for same-sex couples to raise funds for their weddings, it’s the less
    visible facets that will have the most important impact. By having the sites’ main visual aspect be a diverse array of thousands of happy same-sex couples
    who are about to take the step towards the ultimate commitment to one another, SoonEnuf becomes much more than just a crowd funding website. For the LGBT
    community at large, SoonEnuf will be a very real representation of what’s at stake in the battle for equal rights and marriage equality. By displaying to
    the world the personal perspectives and insights on how growing up and living amongst constant ignorance has affected these thousands of diverse couples, a
    much more personal and intimate view into the fight for LGBT equality is suddenly unleashed. Without all the distractions of legal battles and protests,
    stereotypes will be visibly proven false, dialogues will open up and people who previously felt indifferent towards the general treatment of the LGBT
    community may begin to feel more inclined to speak up against ignorance. The change amongst many individual people may not be big, but it doesn’t need to
    be to make a difference. Something as small as hearing the word ‘faggot’ and feeling more inclined to speak up and tell someone ‘you shouldn’t say that’,
    is a step in the right direction and one more vocal supporter of the LGBT community. This site will be many things to many people. For businesses that
    specialize in LGBT weddings, it’ll be a haven of new customers and opportunities. For LGBT organizations and non-profits, it’ll be a valuable resource from
    which to spread and gain support for causes and ventures. One of SoonEnuf’s most significant and powerful functions will be to stand as a beacon of hope.
    With thousands of happy, committed couples on display to the world, this site will stand as living proof to LGBT youth and in the closet individuals
    everywhere that regardless what difficulties and torment they currently face, there is a light at the end of the tunnel and things really do get better.
    SoonEnuf has the power to change and help millions of lives all over the world but the only way it can do that is with the support of everyday people like
    you. Keep reading below to learn more about the site and how you can help make it a reality.</p>

<p>                                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/22057/files/20130819155130-How_Site_Will_Work.JPG?1376952690"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
    It’s very simple actually. It’ll all work in a very similar fashion to typical crowd funding.
</p>
<p>
    1. Couples who want to raise some funds to help with wedding expenses make a profile on the site. Your profile will consist of photos (maybe a short video)
    that showcase the awesome love you two share for each other! You’ll be asked to answer a few questions that will be displayed on your profile including
    things like how you two met and why marriage equality is important to you. You’ll be given the option to add perks to your campaign as a way to thank your
    contributors. These perks can be anything from a personally written thank you note to a copy of the wedding ceremony video to even a special invitation to
    attend the wedding! Next, all you have to do is specify a time limit (max 90 days) that you want to run your campaign, a monetary goal you are trying to
    reach and then go live!
</p>
<p>
    2. From here we help give you the tools to spread the word of your campaign all across your social media, personal contacts, etc. The more you spread the
    word, the more funds you’re likely to raise; so tell EVERYONE.
</p>
<p>
    3. We’ll safely and securely collect the funds you raise (in a similar fashion to kickstarter or indiegogo) throughout the life of your campaign while you
    spread the word and watch as you edge closer and closer to your goal.
</p>
<p>
    4. FUNDED! Once your campaign ends (whether you reach your goal or not) we send out your money minus a 9% processing fee (if we reach at least half of our stretch goal for
    this campaign, the processing fee drops to 4.5%!) along with a special gift from SoonEnuf to congratulate you on your upcoming big day!</p>

    · Putting couples in direct contact with businesses in their local area who provide various services related to wedding planning
</p>
<p>
    · A Q&amp;A feature that will allow straight people (or anyone for that matter) the opportunity to ask questions they’ve always wanted to ask a
    gay/lesbian/bi/transgendered person
</p>
<p>
    · Utilizing what will be a vast network of people who are all affected by LGBT issues to get the word out about other ongoing LGBT causes and campaigns.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
    Plain and simple, $3,000 is the <strong>BARE MINIMUM</strong> required to get this site up and running. Everything has already been planned out and price
    quoted, now we just need the money to pay for it all.
</p>
<p>
    · $400-$500 will be lost to processing fees, paying for the merchandise for our $10, $15, and $30 perks and distributing said merchandise.
</p>
<p>
    · $1500 is going directly to setting up the website. This includes buying the domain name, paying for webhosting to guarantee the site will be up for at
    least 2 years, setting up the basic aesthetics for the site (how you’ll view things, how you’ll interact with the site, etc), and setting up the
    functionality of the site (making everything simple and efficient for those doing campaigns, setting up our newsletter, etc)
</p>
<p>
    · $500 will be used for platform security and automation. This means setting up a proper platform so we can safely and securely collect your contributions
    during your campaign as well as automating features of the site (like your payment distribution, tracking of campaign progress, email distribution, etc) so
    everything stays very user friendly.
</p>
<p>
    · $300 will be utilized for some minor advertising through facebook and google adwords to help really spread the word about SoonEnuf.
</p>
<p>
    · The remaining $200-$300 will pretty much be a buffer in case of unexpected cost like perk distribution problems or addition costs for the site. I know
    this isn’t much of a buffer in case something goes wrong, but like I said, $3,000 is the BARE MINIMUM we need.</p>

    We have a stretch goal of <strong>$30,000. </strong>This is what we’re really shooting for. Meeting this goal would give us the means to really push this
    site to its full potential!
</p>
<p>
    Features that’ll be incorporated if we reach our stretch goal include:
</p>
<p>
    · Having the processing fee applied at the end of your campaign CUT IN HALF, from 9% to 4.5%! We actually only need to reach half of our stretch goal for this change to happen!</p>
<p>
    · Couples who reach their campaign goal, will have the option to donate 5% of the funds they raised to any certified LGBT organization or nonprofit. Those
    who do, will have their processing fee reduced to 3.5%
</p>
<p>
    · Availability of those from other countries (like the UK where same-sex marriage recently became legal) to do campaigns
</p>
<p>
    · A simple and interactive Q&amp;A feature will be added to the site where straight people (or anyone) can publicly and anonymously ask questions they’ve
    always wanted to ask a gay/lesbian/bi/trans person and have them personally answered by someone of that sexual orientation. (I’m REALLY excited about this
    feature because it will help foster a better understanding and less ignorance).
</p>
<p>
    · An app for your smartphone so you can view and track the progress of your campaign on the go, as well as see who’s contributed and how much.
</p>
<p>
    · A mobile version of our site so viewing and contributing to a campaign will be easier and more user friendly on smartphones and tablets.
</p>
<p>
    · A much larger advertising budget that will feature some of our successful campaigns so we can really get the word out there!
</p>
<p>
    · MANY other improvements (too many to name and some we haven’t fully considered since we don’t want to get our hopes up) to the site to really make it top
    notch and much more engaging for people who visit. One feature that's under heavy consideration is expanding the crowd-funding tools to allow <b>any LGBT related campaigns</b> rather than only those to fund same-sex marriages.</p>
<p>
There are TONS of other things we could/would like to do with the site if we reach our stretch goal but we simply <strong>CAN’T</strong> do any of it    <strong>WITHOUT SUPPORT</strong> from the LGBT community and its supporters. We feel support should be a two-way street rather than blindly donating, so
    we’ve put in a lot of work to offer up a long list of awesome perks to benefit people in nearly any scenario. We’ve got perks tailored for those who want
    to do a campaign once the site is up, for LGBT businesses and organizations who could benefit from the recognition and publicity of supporting what’s sure
    to be a popular site, for businesses that provide wedding services and want couples to know who they are, and even for just regular people who want to show
    their support through an awesome shirt, wristband or bumper sticker. There’s perks for literally everyone, so pick your favorite before the opportunity is
    gone!
    <strong>
        On top of all that, as a special token of appreciation, if we reach our stretch goal, one randomly selected person who contributes only $15 and claims
        our ‘Support Bundle!’ perk with receive a brand new iPad mini! Anyone who contributes $30 or more will get a full sized iPad with Retina Display! </strong><br/></p>

        I don’t think there’s a single LGBT person who wouldn’t be able to benefit from this site in some way. Whether it’s having the means to do a crowd
        funding campaign for their wedding on a site that caters specifically to LGBT individuals or just having to endure less ignorance and ridicule in the
        world as views and perspectives slowly change, all LGBT people have a stake in the impact this site will make. I’m a college student and completely
        understand that not everyone has the means to donate to something regardless of how much they believe in it. At the very least, if you could spread the
        word of this campaign, you’re helping not only us, but potentially millions more as we push forward. With that said, if everyone who visits this page
        could PLEASE ‘like’ and ‘share’ our Facebook page, follow us on twitter, share our campaign through your social media with friends and family, and tell
        everyone and anyone you know who could benefit from what we’re going to accomplish, you’d have our SINCEREST gratitude.

<strong><br/></strong><p></p></span></span></span></span></div>","SoonEnuf is a multifunctional site that will establish a simple, yet engaging environment for same-sex couples to raise money from family, friends and even
    strangers to help ease the cost of their wedding expenses. A secondary function of the site (yet highly central to the overall goal I’m pushing to
    accomplish) is to act as a tool to break down the impersonal and polarizing façade that forms around highly publicized and controversial topics (in this
    case, same-sex marriage). By providing a more intimate, first-hand interaction with real people, their interests and experiences, and how they are/will be
    personally affected by the outcomes of the current battle for marriage equality, a dialogue suddenly emerges. By utilizing this dialogue while removing
    constant talk of impersonal aspects like legal battles, protests, petitions, etc… SoonEnuf, the LGBT community and any supporters can accelerate the trend
    of growing support for marriage equality (and other LGBT issues) among everyday people.


    Beyond these goals, the site will have other features to assist and support various aspects of the LGBT community and its supporters with their own
    ventures and endeavors. A particularly useful feature for both couples and businesses that cater to any of the needs associated with planning a wedding
    (especially those who specialize in the particular needs associated with same-sex weddings) is highlighted in our “Wedding Planner” perk. Every Couple who
    sets up a SoonEnuf campaign will be personally provided with a detailed list of businesses (along with contact information and services provided) within a
    75 mile radius of their location that provides wedding-related services. Keep reading below to learn more about SoonEnuf, as well as our long list of
    awesome perks, who I am, more great features the site will offer and the multitude of ways in which SoonEnuf will benefit the LGBT community and its
    supporters!



                            
                                                           


    My name is Ragin Mickens and I’m the founder of SoonEnuf. I’m currently an undergrad student studying civil engineering at the University at Buffalo in
    Buffalo, NY. SoonEnuf is the culmination of my own experiences throughout my past 3 years in college. The idea behind it all actually grew from my desire
    to find a unique and effective way to boost the confidence and self-esteem of ‘in the closet’ LGBT people. I came out to my mom during my last few months
    of high school and the results were… let’s just say pretty disastrous. A big reason I was able to make it through my final months living with my mother was
    because I have a pretty strong and confident personality. Unfortunately, MANY LGBT people (and especially youth) can’t say the same and sadly, lots of them
    go as far as ending their own life to escape the torment they constantly live with. Knowing this, ever since I came out I’ve felt it’s been a personal
    responsibility of mine to ALWAYS speak up against ignorant and demeaning remarks towards LGBT individuals and the community at large. More importantly,
    I’ve always made sure to really explain how such remarks can really damage other people, while still remaining an open-book of sorts to those around me
    with questions about being gay. As a result, I’ve actually changed perspectives and decreased ignorance amongst most (if not all) of my friends and how
    they view the LGBT community.                                                                           
                             

    I recently came to the realization that there’s a severe imbalance in the current approach to create a better life for LGBT individuals. The bulk of this
    approach is focused on either pushing for new laws that promote LGBT equality or trying to increase the confidence and self-esteem of LGBT individuals
    (especially youth). These are both ESSENTIAL to a better life for the LGBT community but they don’t really solve the core issue that spawns the needs for
    these approaches in the first place. That issue is simply the ignorance of many of those who aren’t a part of the LGBT community. Their ignorance (and the
    harmful habits that usually accompany it) is what keeps many LGBT individuals living in fear of revealing their sexual orientation to others. This lack of
    understanding and association is also at the core of why there are so many opponents to marriage equality and other LGBT issues. Obviously we need all the
    protests, rallies and legal suits to really push for equality, but the most effective way to win the overall battle is to change people’s minds and
    perspectives. The best way to do this is to simply let others see the more personal, intimate side of the issue; this is what SoonEnuf will do.


                                             


    Although the main and most visible feature of SoonEnuf will be its use as a way for same-sex couples to raise funds for their weddings, it’s the less
    visible facets that will have the most important impact. By having the sites’ main visual aspect be a diverse array of thousands of happy same-sex couples
    who are about to take the step towards the ultimate commitment to one another, SoonEnuf becomes much more than just a crowd funding website. For the LGBT
    community at large, SoonEnuf will be a very real representation of what’s at stake in the battle for equal rights and marriage equality. By displaying to
    the world the personal perspectives and insights on how growing up and living amongst constant ignorance has affected these thousands of diverse couples, a
    much more personal and intimate view into the fight for LGBT equality is suddenly unleashed. Without all the distractions of legal battles and protests,
    stereotypes will be visibly proven false, dialogues will open up and people who previously felt indifferent towards the general treatment of the LGBT
    community may begin to feel more inclined to speak up against ignorance. The change amongst many individual people may not be big, but it doesn’t need to
    be to make a difference. Something as small as hearing the word ‘faggot’ and feeling more inclined to speak up and tell someone ‘you shouldn’t say that’,
    is a step in the right direction and one more vocal supporter of the LGBT community. This site will be many things to many people. For businesses that
    specialize in LGBT weddings, it’ll be a haven of new customers and opportunities. For LGBT organizations and non-profits, it’ll be a valuable resource from
    which to spread and gain support for causes and ventures. One of SoonEnuf’s most significant and powerful functions will be to stand as a beacon of hope.
    With thousands of happy, committed couples on display to the world, this site will stand as living proof to LGBT youth and in the closet individuals
    everywhere that regardless what difficulties and torment they currently face, there is a light at the end of the tunnel and things really do get better.
    SoonEnuf has the power to change and help millions of lives all over the world but the only way it can do that is with the support of everyday people like
    you. Keep reading below to learn more about the site and how you can help make it a reality.


                                         


    It’s very simple actually. It’ll all work in a very similar fashion to typical crowd funding.


    1. Couples who want to raise some funds to help with wedding expenses make a profile on the site. Your profile will consist of photos (maybe a short video)
    that showcase the awesome love you two share for each other! You’ll be asked to answer a few questions that will be displayed on your profile including
    things like how you two met and why marriage equality is important to you. You’ll be given the option to add perks to your campaign as a way to thank your
    contributors. These perks can be anything from a personally written thank you note to a copy of the wedding ceremony video to even a special invitation to
    attend the wedding! Next, all you have to do is specify a time limit (max 90 days) that you want to run your campaign, a monetary goal you are trying to
    reach and then go live!


    2. From here we help give you the tools to spread the word of your campaign all across your social media, personal contacts, etc. The more you spread the
    word, the more funds you’re likely to raise; so tell EVERYONE.


    3. We’ll safely and securely collect the funds you raise (in a similar fashion to kickstarter or indiegogo) throughout the life of your campaign while you
    spread the word and watch as you edge closer and closer to your goal.


    4. FUNDED! Once your campaign ends (whether you reach your goal or not) we send out your money minus a 9% processing fee (if we reach at least half of our stretch goal for
    this campaign, the processing fee drops to 4.5%!) along with a special gift from SoonEnuf to congratulate you on your upcoming big day!


                                      


    · Putting couples in direct contact with businesses in their local area who provide various services related to wedding planning


    · A Q&A feature that will allow straight people (or anyone for that matter) the opportunity to ask questions they’ve always wanted to ask a
    gay/lesbian/bi/transgendered person


    · Utilizing what will be a vast network of people who are all affected by LGBT issues to get the word out about other ongoing LGBT causes and campaigns.


                                            


    Plain and simple, $3,000 is the BARE MINIMUM required to get this site up and running. Everything has already been planned out and price
    quoted, now we just need the money to pay for it all.


    · $400-$500 will be lost to processing fees, paying for the merchandise for our $10, $15, and $30 perks and distributing said merchandise.


    · $1500 is going directly to setting up the website. This includes buying the domain name, paying for webhosting to guarantee the site will be up for at
    least 2 years, setting up the basic aesthetics for the site (how you’ll view things, how you’ll interact with the site, etc), and setting up the
    functionality of the site (making everything simple and efficient for those doing campaigns, setting up our newsletter, etc)


    · $500 will be used for platform security and automation. This means setting up a proper platform so we can safely and securely collect your contributions
    during your campaign as well as automating features of the site (like your payment distribution, tracking of campaign progress, email distribution, etc) so
    everything stays very user friendly.


    · $300 will be utilized for some minor advertising through facebook and google adwords to help really spread the word about SoonEnuf.


    · The remaining $200-$300 will pretty much be a buffer in case of unexpected cost like perk distribution problems or addition costs for the site. I know
    this isn’t much of a buffer in case something goes wrong, but like I said, $3,000 is the BARE MINIMUM we need.


                                                       


    We have a stretch goal of $30,000. This is what we’re really shooting for. Meeting this goal would give us the means to really push this
    site to its full potential!


    Features that’ll be incorporated if we reach our stretch goal include:


    · Having the processing fee applied at the end of your campaign CUT IN HALF, from 9% to 4.5%! We actually only need to reach half of our stretch goal for this change to happen!

    · Couples who reach their campaign goal, will have the option to donate 5% of the funds they raised to any certified LGBT organization or nonprofit. Those
    who do, will have their processing fee reduced to 3.5%


    · Availability of those from other countries (like the UK where same-sex marriage recently became legal) to do campaigns


    · A simple and interactive Q&A feature will be added to the site where straight people (or anyone) can publicly and anonymously ask questions they’ve
    always wanted to ask a gay/lesbian/bi/trans person and have them personally answered by someone of that sexual orientation. (I’m REALLY excited about this
    feature because it will help foster a better understanding and less ignorance).


    · An app for your smartphone so you can view and track the progress of your campaign on the go, as well as see who’s contributed and how much.


    · A mobile version of our site so viewing and contributing to a campaign will be easier and more user friendly on smartphones and tablets.


    · A much larger advertising budget that will feature some of our successful campaigns so we can really get the word out there!


    · MANY other improvements (too many to name and some we haven’t fully considered since we don’t want to get our hopes up) to the site to really make it top
    notch and much more engaging for people who visit. One feature that's under heavy consideration is expanding the crowd-funding tools to allow any LGBT related campaigns rather than only those to fund same-sex marriages.

There are TONS of other things we could/would like to do with the site if we reach our stretch goal but we simply CAN’T do any of it    WITHOUT SUPPORT from the LGBT community and its supporters. We feel support should be a two-way street rather than blindly donating, so
    we’ve put in a lot of work to offer up a long list of awesome perks to benefit people in nearly any scenario. We’ve got perks tailored for those who want
    to do a campaign once the site is up, for LGBT businesses and organizations who could benefit from the recognition and publicity of supporting what’s sure
    to be a popular site, for businesses that provide wedding services and want couples to know who they are, and even for just regular people who want to show
    their support through an awesome shirt, wristband or bumper sticker. There’s perks for literally everyone, so pick your favorite before the opportunity is
    gone!
    
        On top of all that, as a special token of appreciation, if we reach our stretch goal, one randomly selected person who contributes only $15 and claims
        our ‘Support Bundle!’ perk with receive a brand new iPad mini! Anyone who contributes $30 or more will get a full sized iPad with Retina Display!

    and we’ll mail them out at the conclusion of the campaign. You can mix and match or pick 3 of the same item, you choose!

    Have the name of your business, organization, brand or company permanently displayed on the “Proud Supporters” page of our website where you can be
    recognized by any and everyone who visits our site! This site is going to garner A LOT of attention and this perk is the perfect way to get a lot of people
    informed about your site and its support of the LGBT community.

    A step up from ‘Supporter’. Have the name of your business, organization, brand or company permanently displayed on the “Proud Supporters” page of our site
    along with your logo and a link to your website or preferred site destination. With all the publicity and traffic SoonEnuf is sure to get, this perk is a
    great way to get recognized while driving traffic to your own site!


$50 – SoonEnuf Newlyweds! 


    Thinking of doing a SoonEnuf campaign once the site is up? Take advantage of this great value ahead of time. The first 60 couples who pledge $50 to our
    campaign guarantee themselves a 4.5% processing fee (rather than 9%) on the funds they raise! And if we raise at least half our stretch goal, (at which point the
    processing fee drops to 4.5% for everyone) yours will drop to only 2.75%! This is a great way to keep money in your pocket to spend on your big day!


$100 – Premium Supporter! 


    Best recognition value that’s only topped by our ‘Sponsor’ perks. Have your business logo, name and web address displayed in our “Premium Supporters”
    section which will feature a larger space for your business info (to increase your chances of recognition). Also, you’re given the ability to call upon us
    (on up to 10 separate occasions!) throughout our first year of operation to utilize our resources to promote the ventures of your business or organization.
    That means spreading the word of your business through our social media, email contacts and newsletter! This perk is awesome for not only getting your
    business recognized, but for getting your cause or venture known to the masses!


$100 – SoonEnuf Newlyweds Premium! 


    Best value for those planning on doing a campaign! The first 25 couples to pledge $100 to our campaign will have their processing fee COMPLETELY WAIVED
    (regardless of if we reach our stretch goal) on the funds they raise during their campaign! That means every penny you raise, you keep!


$125 – Same-Sex Wedding Needs! 


    Have a business that provides wedding related services (anything ranging from space vendors, floral arrangements, cakes, etc)? By contributing $125 to our
    campaign, your business information will be personally provided to every couple who makes a campaign within a 75 mile radius of your location for our
    entire first year of operation! This is an incredible value that can not only easily pay for itself, but also allows us to bring business straight to you!


$250 – Proud Sponsor! 


    Getting into the heavy weights now. As a ‘Proud Sponsor’ and for providing this level of support, you’ll have our greatest appreciation and we’ll make sure
    people know who you are and what you do! Your business/organization will receive a full page in EVERY issue of our bi-weekly newsletter to advertise
    yourself, as well as special recognition ‘shout outs’ AT LEAST once a month across our various social media sites along with links to your site. In a
    similar fashion to a ‘Premium Supporter’, you’ll be given my personal email address with the ability to call upon us to promote your ventures/causes on up
    to 10 separate occasions throughout our first year of operations. Your business/organization info will also be displayed in the prominent space of our
    ‘Proud Sponsors’ page where it will occupy space TWICE the size of that allowed to our ‘Premium Supporters’. Finally, you’ll receive 2 of our personally
    designed SoonEnuf shirts along with 2 of our “Damn Right I Support It” bracelets and both of our bumper stickers. This perk is limited to an availability
    of only 20!


$500 – Premium Sponsor! 


    The Big One. Our highest level of recognition! We make sure everyone who knows us, also knows you. Everything included in the “Proud Sponsor” contribution
    with the addition of receiving special recognition ‘shout outs’ at least TWICE a month as well as receiving all 4 of our personally designed marriage
    equality shirts. Also, for our first year of operations you’ll have your logo with website link displayed on the most prominent space of our site; our
    HOMEPAGE! You’ll also be mentioned in every press release we send out throughout our first year of operations as well as have your business/organizations
    name, logo and web address featured in the welcome email sent to EVERY couple who starts a new campaign on our site. Basically, we make sure you’ll be seen
    everywhere we’re seen to maximize the exposure of your business/organization. DON’T HESITATE THOUGH, we only offer this perk to the FIRST 10 people who
    grab it.


                                                



        I don’t think there’s a single LGBT person who wouldn’t be able to benefit from this site in some way. Whether it’s having the means to do a crowd
        funding campaign for their wedding on a site that caters specifically to LGBT individuals or just having to endure less ignorance and ridicule in the
        world as views and perspectives slowly change, all LGBT people have a stake in the impact this site will make. I’m a college student and completely
        understand that not everyone has the means to donate to something regardless of how much they believe in it. At the very least, if you could spread the
        word of this campaign, you’re helping not only us, but potentially millions more as we push forward. With that said, if everyone who visits this page
        could PLEASE ‘like’ and ‘share’ our Facebook page, follow us on twitter, share our campaign through your social media with friends and family, and tell
        everyone and anyone you know who could benefit from what we’re going to accomplish, you’d have our SINCEREST gratitude.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Situation</h3>
<p>Every 9 seconds a woman in the United States is abused. But few people are like Asma Hanif who have dedicated their entire lives to actually doing something to stop that. She founded one of the only shelters for battered Muslim women in the United States, Muslimat Al-Nisaa, and is relentless in urging leaders to stop sweeping this ugly issue under the rug and pretending like it doesn't happen.<br/><br/>And now, because of how much she gives to helping the women at this shelter - Asma has given up everything of her own in return. She has no income and no home. The shelter she started is where she lives too. It's a willing sacrifice she makes to help the people around her, and she of all people shouldn't have to. It wouldn't be a surprise if the women she's helped are your mothers, sisters, daughters, cousins or at least someone you know. And even if they aren't she wouldn't hesitate to take care of them if they turned to her for help.<br/><br/>Why can't we do the same for her? We all hope and pray that her reward will be from Allah, but she, of all people, deserves good from this life and from the people around her.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>By trade, Asma is a nurse. She takes care of strangers and ensures their well-being but isn't able to do the same for her very own mother. Now, she is in need of a place of her own where she can take care of her sick mother, who is suffering from a terrible disease. Someone with a bad disease and other health conditions needs proper medical attention and cannot live in a shelter that houses dozens of women and children. <br/><br/>If that is not enough to help the Muslim woman devoted to improving our community, then what is?<br/><br/>Without her asking, her friends decided to set up this fundraiser to get Sister Asma and her mother a place to stay. Buying her a house would be ideal. However, if we can raise at least a year's worth of rent for her, it would be a great start. We have located an adequate place in the DC area that rents for about $1,200 a month (a standard rate for housing in the area). That comes out to about $14,400 a year. She would be able to stay close to the shleter and have her privacy to help her mother out in the last stage of her life.<br/><br/>Every penny, every dollar that we are all capable of giving, helps build a shelter for Asma as she whithers a storm that we pray nobody should have to go through. Especially alone.</div>

<p class=""p1""><em><strong>Greetings.</strong></em> My name is Jen Piché and I live in Temecula, California. I need your help raising money for an admirable woman to become a U.S. Citizen. Because of her generous care, my parents were able to remain at home on their beloved ranch as their health declined, right up to the end. This was their greatest wish. Now I want to grant <em>her</em> wish and fulfill her dream of U.S. Citizenship.</p>

<p><em><strong>Meet Maura Gomez</strong></em>, age 58. From El Salvador, she's been in the U.S. - LEGALLY - for 30+ years, toiling away at various jobs. Living in Hemet, CA, she has her ""Green Card,"" CA Driver's License, and a car. A live-in caregiver at my parents' home for almost 3 years, Maura tended lovingly to my bedridden mother, until mom died of Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>Then she cared for my father until we lost him to Parkinson's.</p>
<p><em><strong>My Brilliant Dad:  </strong></em>Not everyone could cope with my dry-witted, curmudgeonly old dad. Maura handled his mischief with humor and affection. She juiced greens for his tube feedings, cajoled him to do his exercises, emptied his catheter bag, and fretted over him like a mother bird. She cried with each parent's passing, and now prefers housecleaning jobs - just can't bear the losses.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><em><strong>The Facts, Ma'am. Give Us the Facts:  </strong></em>Since she's over 50 and has been a Permanent U.S. Resident for 20+ years, all she needs for citizenship is $680+$200 for fees and paperwork, and to take a test. Maura does speak English (kind of like Chico Marx). However, since she doesn't read or write, her sister will help her. All the money raised will go to Maura, other than the small percentage for IndieGogo and Paypal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><em><strong>She's a Good Woman:  </strong></em>When my mom first left us, Maura stayed on for $25/day - just out of the goodness of her heart - rather than abandon my dad. It was all we could afford to pay her. (Fortunately, I was able to find resources to pay her more, thanks to the State of California, family, and some very good friends.)</p>

<p><strong><em>I'm Impressed:</em> </strong>Maura is inspiring. Growing up very poor in El Salvador, she never had the chance to go to school. Even though she can't read the street signs, she drives all over; the woman is fearless! She will learn the route to a housecleaning job and remember it visually. A diabetic, she has taught herself to read the sugar content on packages. Divorced from an abusive husband, Maura has no children of her own, but dotes on her nieces and nephew.</p>
<p><em><strong>Wrap It Up, Lady:  </strong></em>Citizenship will be a just reward for this hard-working woman, who helped 2 old folks stay home in spite of failing health. Our whole family is deeply grateful to her. Any amount you can pitch in will be hugely appreciated. Thank you heaps.</p>

<p><span>Nancy’s Avenue is that place you will come to and relax in an invigorating atmosphere of art and forward thinkers. A one-stop shop for your design and decorating needs. From parties to weddings to holiday decorating for your home or business – Nancy’s Avenue is here for you.

On Friday nights we hope you’ll stop by to listen to local musicians share their gifts on a small, makeshift stage. In the back room, you can peruse the cool furniture designs for your bedroom and patio. You’ll find a fold down desk made from the tailgate of the first truck I bought my husband when he was just 20 years old. We can take your old and make it new again. If I (or you) can dream it – we’ll make it.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve looked at the numbers. We checked them twice, a hundred times. Your contributions will help secure a storefront and construct a setting folks will never want to leave. Thanks to you we will purchase a walk in cooler and display cooler; Tools to turn ordinary, discarded doors into bookcases, headboards into benches, windows into canopies and more. It will cover decorating and seasonal products and supplies for design and decorating jobs. Your gifts will aide in the advertisement costs and signs and brochures.</span></p>
<p>I don’t remember a time when the ideas didn’t just start to flow the minute my feet touched the floor in the mornings. I was in the fifth grade when a teacher told me I wasn’t getting enough sleep. I couldn’t sleep – I was  dreaming. And conscious dreams are so much more fun than subconscious. They require thought and planning and art and math.</p>
<p>In between marriage, four kids, two battles with cancer and losing everything when the economy took a nose dive in 2008, those dreams were shelved. Then I stumbled into  a part time job as an inexperienced florist last spring and suddenly - I was… am… alive again.</p>
<p><span>In an unfortunate turn of events, the flower shop sold and took a downward turn. Brainstorming with the lead designer, we realized we both share the same vision. With his experience, loyal clientele and my love for coloring outside the lines, it is a match made in heaven. And there you have it – the birth of Nancy’s Avenue.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope you will support this endeavor. I assure you that your gifts and contributions will spread exponentially as we give a portion of all profits back to the community. People are valuable and amazing and I don’t sleep well knowing a single person doubts this truth. The name Nancy – it means grace and Nancy’s Avenue will be not only a place of art, but an entity that supports and encourages others…with grace.</span></p>

In between marriage, four kids, two battles with cancer and losing everything when the economy took a nose dive in 2008, those dreams were shelved. Then I stumbled into  a part time job as an inexperienced florist last spring and suddenly - I was… am… alive again.
In an unfortunate turn of events, the flower shop sold and took a downward turn. Brainstorming with the lead designer, we realized we both share the same vision. With his experience, loyal clientele and my love for coloring outside the lines, it is a match made in heaven. And there you have it – the birth of Nancy’s Avenue.
I hope you will support this endeavor. I assure you that your gifts and contributions will spread exponentially as we give a portion of all profits back to the community. People are valuable and amazing and I don’t sleep well knowing a single person doubts this truth. The name Nancy – it means grace and Nancy’s Avenue will be not only a place of art, but an entity that supports and encourages others…with grace.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What's the Point?</h3>
<p>Hello, I am KJ. It’s nice to meet you! Project Offspring was born out of a dual reaction of love and frustration. I am a fan of social media as are most of my friends and family. The reason I have so much passion for this project is because as much as I love the community involved in social media, I have yet to find a place that is truly there for everyone.</p>
<p>There seems to be an overwhelming amount of bigotry that is overlooked and often encouraged on some of these sites. The Offspring Project is hoping to change that.</p>
<p>Everyone needs and deserves a safe place to be creative, vent, have fun, meet new people and/or just relax after a hard day.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $35,000. This was the bare minimum we can operate with. We have set our goal at $37,700 to cover the Indigogo fees. After fees, if we meet our goal, we will have $35,061.</p>
<p>When we say “<em>Bare minimum</em>” that’s what we mean! The person building this site, Jonathan Miller,  has been kind enough to do the job at a more than 50% discount of his normal rate. It’s good to have friends that care! Luckily, he believes in this project so deeply that he is willing to work at such a low rate to make this a reality. He has even set up a <a href=""http://mdshostingservices.net/projectoffspring"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">boutique site</a> for the project!</p>
<p><em><strong>This amount would cover three things specifically:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>The building/maintaining of the site for one year.</li>
<li>The cost of a dedicated server for one year.</li>
<li>The cost of a second person (<em>in addition to KJ who is working for free</em>) to work part time to help keep the site safe for all users.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Let’s Talk Perks!</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Email Updates</strong>- We’ll send out special email updates to all donors. We will be making private, donor only, announcements and letting you know about the progress the site is making.</li>
<li>
<strong>Special Preview</strong>- You get in first! After the Beta testing is finished, you’ll get a chance to get in and play around before the general public sees anything! You get to be a part of a special group that get’s to have a first look!</li>
<li>
<strong>Beta Tester</strong>- You get to try to break things! Okay, no not really. But...sort of! You get to go in and play, tell us what you like and don’t like. Suggest changes or additions. Yes, you even get to try to “Break things!” We want to know that the site is going to stand up to just about everything and you’ll get to see if it actually does!</li>
<li>
<strong>Charity Vote</strong>- Two months after the site is active to the public, we are going to start the $1 charity. Every month, there will be a different charity to donate to. People are constantly saying that people don’t/can’t make a difference online. I think we can prove them wrong! You will get a say in which charities we donate to in the first year!</li>
<li>
<strong>Undying Appreciation</strong>- This goes without saying but I’ll say it anyway. THANK YOU! WE APPRECIATE YOU! The amount of affection people have shown for this project in such a short amount of time has let me and everyone working with me know that not only is there a want for this but a <em>need</em>. I am confident that this site can help to fill a void that none of us should have. We all deserve to feel safe. Every single one of us. Also, please know that we do realize that not everyone can give financially. If this is something you are interested in but can't give dollars, helping us get the word out is a fantastic way to help. The appreciation is certainly not limited to those with a bank account. To those that have already been so passionate and kind in the starting of this project, I thank you. We thank you. We can and will make a difference.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not meet our initial goal, the plans will still go forth. If the total is not met, we will take whatever we do get and do as much as possible with what we have. We will also continue fund-raising. This is a project that I and everyone involved are passionate about. Everyone deserves a safe place.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact we hope to make is to help fill an ugly void. Many of us do not have a safe haven in our every day lives. Unfortunately, our online lives aren’t often much different. This project hopes to change that. Yes, it is just another social site. At least, we hope that is how it feels. If we have done our jobs correctly, you won’t even have to think about your safety. You will just <em>be safe</em>. That safety will allow you to be creative. That safety will allow you to vent your frustrations without fear of retaliation. That safety will allow you to...<em>relax</em>. At least, a little bit. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can’t donate money? How about a quick reblog on Tumblr? You can’t donate money? How about a quick link on Facebook? You can’t donate money? How about telling someone you know?</p>
<p>Money is not easy to come by. Most people just don’t have it to give. If you are one of those people, you can be just as big a help to us as those that can donate money. Talk about us. Tell anyone you can. You might not be able to donate money but your time is your wealth. Your word is your donation. We need you. If you have a dollar or if you the time. We need you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Daniel and Shellie Terry, from Sparks Nv.  We have been a part of Faces of Grace Outreach Ministry for the last 4 years.  We started as volunteers, but have been in charge of fund raising for the last 3 years!  We are dedicated to help people in need, the working poor and those who need a hand to get back on their feet in our community.  Faces of Grace will be hosting the 7th Annual Homeless Awareness &amp; Prevention Day, here in Reno/Sparks.  On that day we will serve lunch, free groceries, free clothing, free hygiene supplies, free haircuts, as well as feature many community services to 3000-7000 people in need. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To fund an event this size, we need $10,000.00.  This money is used for food and paper products for lunch; Drinks and snacks for the children; Generator fuel; Portable Restrooms and Hand Washing Stations; Fuel for transporting supplies, volunteers and guests; Park Fees; Liability Insurance; and other various supplies.  People who donate to this event will greatly impact the community.  For less than $3.00 a person, you can provide a day of hope and possibilities, fellowship and resources, as well as much needed sustaining every day supplies.  All preparation and execution of this event is 100% volunteer driven.  Any money donated goes directly to the outreach.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>People who attend this event often get their clothing for winter survival, a haircut for job searching and other important services.  We have several testimonies of guests who were on the streets, getting the boost they needed from attending Homeless Awareness &amp; Prevention Day, and are now working and able to pay rent.  Those people return, year after year, now, as volunteers, and inspirations to others.</p>

<div><strong>The Impact</strong></div>
<div>About 100 years ago, Sunny’s was a home base to longshoremen working at the docks of Red Hook Brooklyn. Over time, Sunny’s became a bar, passed down through three generations of the Balzano family, landing in the hands of Antonio “Sunny” Balzano in the 1980s. Sunny’s maintains a home-like feel, so much so that Sunny’s is a place where a regular Joe and celebrities butt elbows at the bar on any given night.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Very few places are left in NYC that harken back to a nearly extinct era where artists and musicians can come together to share their work and create community.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With your support, Sunny's can open our doors again by the end of June, and Sunny himself will finally again be able to say, “Welcome Home, Kid!”</div>

<p> </p></div>","Sunny’s Bar was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy, and the damage to the building requires significant resources to make repairs in the basement and get Sunny’s back up and open.

What We Need
Restoring an historic bar is no easy task. The work we need in the basement has already been surveyed and drawn.  As soon as we get the permit from the Dept. of Buildings, we'll start digging! We just need help to pay for the big bill.
 
What we have been able to get so far…

Pumping and Debris Removal
Concrete Footing
Boiler Replacement
Hot water heater replacement
New Boiler Room Slab
Sewer Cleaning
Full Electrical Replacement
New compressor
Engineers Reports and Drawings
Geotechnical Reports
Architectural Drawings and Expeditor Fees
Legal Fees
 
The big stuff we still need…

Needle Beam Supports
New Concrete Slab foundation
Reinforce walls
Removal of Walk-in Refrigerator
Helica Piles
Resurfacing of floors
Painting
Sump Pump

<p>We're a group of current and former Bowie High School students, brought together by the impact Mr. McIntyre and Mrs. Maxwell had on each of our lives. We're from different classes, different years, and different backgrounds, but we're working as a team to plan an event that honors these two outstanding educators.</p>
<h3><strong>How Is This Event Going to Work?</strong></h3>
<p>On <strong>Sunday June 2, 2013 at 2:00pm</strong>, we will have a student-run surprise retirement ceremony for Mr. McIntyre and Mrs. Maxwell.  It's going to have two parts. We're going to begin with a ceremony in the Bowie Center for the Performing Arts - we'll recognize them for their careers, have speeches from their family members, watch tribute videos, and share many, many jokes<em>.</em></p>
<p>After we're done in the BCPA, everyone will make the trek up the ramp to the Bowie High Cafeteria for an extended reception period. We'll have some light food options, a DJ to keep the mood upbeat, and plenty of time for everyone to mingle and catch up with former classmates. </p>
<p>We're planning the entire event as a surprise, so make sure not to mention anything to either one of them! (That applies especially to you current BHS students!) We want them to feel our collective gratitude for their many years of dedicated, selfless service to education. </p>
<h3><strong>Why Do We Need Money?</strong></h3>
<p>First and foremost, we want this even to be free and easy to attend. Your donations will help us accomplish that by covering facilities costs and other administrative expenses. </p>
<p>Second, we want to get both of them a nice gift. Your donations will help facilitate the different options we're considering (and your suggestions for this are certainly welcome!)</p>
<p>Finally, we're seeking to make the event fun and allow for former classmates to reunite and catch up. Because of that, we're looking to provide an atmosphere at the post-event reception that is relaxed and friendly. This involves decorations, catering and personnel, and your donations will help make that dream a reality. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is $5160 (The $160 being the 4% fee for reaching our fundraising goals). With that $5000 budget, we'll be carefully examining the quotes we've gotten from different vendors to make the event as successful as possible. </p>
<p>We've designed a system of perks that will allow you to show your gratitude and appreciation to Mr. McIntyre and Mrs. Maxwell in a variety of different ways. Please read through each of them and consider donating to help this event become a reality.</p>
<p>Even with all of that, we want to emphasize that the focus of the event is on two amazing educators. If we don't raise a dime through this page, we'll still all get together and celebrate the impact McIntyre and Maxwell have made on our lives. We're looking for donations to make this a community-wide celebration. </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Bowie has many qualities of a small town, and the interconnectedness of Bowie High is certainly one of them. Mr. McIntyre and Mrs. Maxwell have devoted themselves to the enrichment of our city and our community through their dedication to every student that came into their classroom. </p>
<p>Your donation will allow us to make certain they know, as they head into retirement, that they have enriched thousands upon thousands of lives. </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, you can still help us make this a reality! </p>
<p>Let us know if you have any connection to a local business that may be willing to advertize in our program or offer a donation. Many businesses in our area employ Bowie High graduates (or are even run by BHS grads), and we'd love to get as many of them as possible involved in this effort. </p>
<p>Most of all, save the date for June 2nd! Tell your friends, former classmates, parents, and anyone else you think should know about this event. We want to pack the house and show our appreciation, and we need YOU - the most important part of this event - to make that happen.</p></div>","Who We Are

<h3>Our Story:</h3>
<p>One cold winter day in a city playground, while our beloved children swirled around us, a single mom and a stay-at-home mom/part-time nanny started fantasizing about starting a business.  Giggling and dreaming and brainstorming, we allowed ourselves to visualize our fantasy as reality, and before you knew it we were checking out books at the library, pouring over financial spreadsheets, and preparing power point presentations.</p>
<p>What was our vision that so propelled us? Try to imagine walking down the Ithaca Commons on a cold and dark winter afternoon, and finding within a storefront a whole make-believe world. A child happily ascends a play structure and another one hops onto the slide. On the other side of the room behind a mural of the Commons, a little girl is tending store behind a play cash register, and another child fills a shopping cart. On a wooden loft above, two children prepare a meal at a play kitchen for some happy dolls in miniature high chairs. Behind the desk, a woman makes coffee and folds clothing for sale while a group of parents sit chatting with each other on two couches, their playful infants rolling around on a handmade quilt safely within reach.</p>
<p>This is Bloom, where budding minds go to play. It’s an indoor play spot for children aged 1-8, an educational and recreational center for families, and a retail clothing store specializing in American made, fair trade, organic, recycled, or handmade clothing and toys for children aged 2-8 and high quality, responsible clothing for women.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>After nine months of very hard work, we have already realized half of our dream.  On Black Friday, we opened the doors of Bloom on the Ithaca Commons. Our retail store supplies the Ithaca community with sweatshop-free alternatives to mass produced clothing and gifts. From one of a kind handmade dolls in all color combinations to American made Ninja and Superhero t-shirts to organic cotton nursing bras, we've got Ithaca families all in a buzz about Bloom. However, nothing has created more excitement and anticipation than news of our upcoming play place, and thats where you come in. </p>
<p>In order to create the play place of our dreams, we need another $6000. In order to realize this dream, we've had to quit our jobs and subsist on faith.  We don't have any more personal funds or bank financing we can call on. We could wait another few months while we try to raise the money from more traditional means, but its cold outside in Ithaca, and there's a foot of snow on the playgrounds! We think you need this play place now!</p>
<p>What's more, we want the financial security to be able to offer all the events and special offers that will make Bloom great and viable for all tiers of Ithaca Families, including:</p>
<p><strong>Free Fridays after Five--come start the weekend with free play at Bloom!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Three Dollar Thursdays--discounted admission all day. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday Mugs--Free Coffee on Mondays!</strong></p>
<p>The $6000 we are asking for will cover:</p>
<p>-Significant cosmetic renovations to our space. Although we are doing most of the work ourselves, we will be converting a century old storage room into safe kid space and updating the design of rooms that haven't been touched in decades!</p>
<p>-Construction of a play grocery store and a play restaurant, and purchase of toys and props.</p>
<p>-Construction of a loft ""apartment"" where children can play house.</p>
<p>-Comissioning of a mural by artist Grace Ritter to bring art and style to our space, as well as to set the ""stage"" for imaginative play.</p>
<p>-Purchases of American made furniture for our art space and parent lounge.</p>
<p>-Equipment for a self-serve coffee and healthy-snack bar for parents and children.</p>
<h3><strong>What You'll Get in Return:</strong></h3>
<p>In exchange for your contribution, you'll recieve the satisfaction knowing that you are helping achieve something for your community, that you are helping support imaginative play and involved parenting, American companies and jobs, and the revitalization of Downtown Ithaca. You'll also get lots of grattitude on our webpage, facebook wall, and on a permanent Thank You Wall we will paint next to our snack bar. And if you can contribute $25 or more, you can get hours of free play, VIP treatment, coupons, gift certificates, and even permanent discounts. And if you can donate $5000, we will set up a fund in your name to provide free play time to children who normally can't afford it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
We want to give Ithaca parents the opportunity to socialize and build community all the time, especially in the winter. We want to give Ithaca kids the opportunity to play with other children in a less structured environment than their school.  We want to provide a model of what imaginative and active play can look like without plastic imported toys that exploit workers overseas and poison our environments while cluttering our homes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You too can be a part of this vision!</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that times are tough, and we also know firsthand the stress of unpaid bills and scarce pantries. If you aren't in a position to contribute this time around, you can still help us. Get the word out and make noise about our campaign. Call up wealthier relatives and tell them you need a place for playdates and they can help. Please share our campaign on facebook and twitter! And even more important, come visit us at Bloom and see what we have to offer.</p>

<p>Please help three crazy people start a small organic farm in Washington State.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi I’m Kat. It’s been a lifelong dream of mine to have a small organic farm that produces fresh organic fruits and vegetables, farm fresh organic eggs, and organic goat cheese. Somehow I’ve managed to convince both my husband David and our best friend Rook that this is a great idea.</p>
<p>David grew up on a horse ranch and knows all of the hard work and effort that goes into raising healthy happy animals. I love gardening as most of my extended family has gardened or farmed in one way or another throughout most of my growing up as well and I feel a deep connection to the earth and love to grow things. There is just something about the smell of damp earth and the feel of moist soil between your fingers. Our best friend Rook grew up raising cows and goats.</p>
<p>Together the three of us hope to start a very small sustainable organic farm  that will not only help to improve our overall health but give back to the community as well. By delivering organic farm fresh produce to local farmers markets, foodbanks and (hopefully) restaurants, we will be able to help people know just where there food is coming from and feel secure in the knowledge that it’s healthy, chemical, and GMO free.</p>
<p>Doing the research for this project has shown me that to start our adventure in agriculture it will run us somewhere between 90 and 100,000 dollars. We know that this is a large sum of money, but we are starting from scratch. Even if we don't reach our full goal any money we raise will go towards starting this venture.</p>
<p>There are several things that we will need to successfully launch our business.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We need to purchase the land. We are hoping to find roughly 10 to 15 acres of wooded or semi wooded land (for a reasonable price) with a good source of water somewhere in Washington State. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We will need to build both our home and the milking and cheese manufacturing facilities. As well as the barn and paddock for the goats (and the llama) and the coop for the chickens. The dairy industry is the most highly regulated food industry in the U.S. so everything must be built to specific codes.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We will need to purchase equipment, livestock, and seeds. We can’t make goat cheese without the goats after all, or collect farm fresh eggs without chickens, and the last time I checked, you can’t grow fruits and veggies without seeds and trees, and it's difficult to build anything without the proper tools and supplies.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We are also thinking that some time down the road, (after all goat cheese making, and egg harvesting, and fruit and veggie growing is well under way) that we might add an apiary to our farm and try our hands at producing honey. But that would be a long way off in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We truly feel that there needs to be more effort and enphisis on small scale organic farming in our country. To help keep things sustainable and lower the environmental impact we need to go back to our roots and start again at the begining. Your donations can help us show that we can produce good healthy food in a sustainable fashion without destroying the planet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if you can't afford to make a donation, you can still help us by spreading the word and sharing the link to our fundraiser with as many people as you can. Indegog supports linking through facebook, Google +, and Twitter. If you feel as strongly about  improving life and sustainable farming as we do then please, make some noise.</p>

No one believed me because I was the girl with a busted, noisy car that broke down every other week. Since joining the Air Force, I have been deployed and assigned overseas several times and returned home only to spend all my money just to get the Stang back up and running again. The car has been continually neglected in my absence and also broken into twice ruining much of the interior.<br/></span></span></p>

<p>Recently, I met the owner of Mustang Central, Allan Shepley. His shop has been featured in Mustang Monthly several times and he has been a part of many restoration projects on TV.

<h3><strong>The Goal</strong></h3>
<p>The goal amount needed to get the custom restore by Mustang Central is $60K. Because we will be working vigorously to offset the costs of the project while it is in progress, we are teaming up with local charities to donate any excess money collected.

<h3> </h3></div>","The Story
Hi, my name is Kristen and I have had my 1973 Mustang since I was a sophomore in high school and have always said SOMEDAY this car will be awesome. No one believed me because I was the girl with a busted, noisy car that broke down every other week. Since joining the Air Force, I have been deployed and assigned overseas several times and returned home only to spend all my money just to get the Stang back up and running again. The car has been continually neglected in my absence and also broken into twice ruining much of the interior.
 



 

The Solution 

Recently, I met the owner of Mustang Central, Allan Shepley. His shop has been featured in Mustang Monthly several times and he has been a part of many restoration projects on TV. Allan is just as excited about this project as I am, gave me a fair quote and would like to feature the car on his website throughout the rebuild!! I am finally in a position to stay put and look after my baby so the timing is perfect. Unfortunately, I have recently hit hard times financially due to helping out a friend in need.

The Goal
The goal amount needed to get the custom restore by Mustang Central is $60K. Because we will be working vigorously to offset the costs of the project while it is in progress, we are teaming up with local charities to donate any excess money collected. All funds will go towards making a lifelong dream come true and/or feeding the needy in the local area. If by chance, we do not meet our goal, the money raised will go to a single project for the car determined by the amount gathered.
This is close to what we're going for...fully restored to 100% mint condition but with a few differences.  All the chrome will be black including the wheels and instead of a deep gray the paint will be gloss black.  Which is why we called the project ""Stealth Stallion"".

The opportunity to have this kind of top-notch, custom work is ONCE IN A LIFETIME! Having the project tracking is exciting and icing on the cake!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
I was born in rural village in western Kenya where I used kerosene lamps for studying. I was greatly affected and many of my friends dropped out of school. I decided to do something. In 2004 while I was 19 years old, i designed a simple solar lamp from mostly recycled materials which I call 'Mwangabora'.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Through my organization, Sustainable Development For All (<a href=""http://www.sdfa-kenya.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sdfa-kenya.org</a>), I have been distributing the solar lamps to poor rural families through women groups, and then helping the women set up income projects from the money they would have otherwise spent on kerosene. The solar lamps are greatly improving education for children and on my birthday on 11th March, I kindly ask you to help me provide this GIFT to 100 poor rural children in Kenya.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
We want to raise $2500 since each solar lamp costs us $25 to locally make. the lamps will be used by 100 families thsu directly impacting over 500 people.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Each $25 will benefit at least 5 people and help at least 3 children study well. In addition, the mothers of all the children who will get the solar lamps will be trained in business skills and encouraged to save the money they would have otherwise spent on kerosene. They will then use the savings to start at least 1 income generating project after 4-6 months. The income project will not only provide them with a regular source of income but will also help them be self reliant and live happier lives.</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
help us SPREAD the word. Email,tweet, facebook and share in any way with your friends, family or co-workers. You can also organize a small or big event to support our efforts.</div></div>","Short Summary

The
Project
Help us to improve education, transportation, communication, and job prospects in a remote Himalayan town through skiing!
We are Cara and Heather, and we are passionate about sharing our skill and love for snow travel with a community who could experience culturally and environmentally sustainable positive development as a result.
What does $10 mean to you?  For the students of Padum, it means the opportunity to learn skills that will improve communication, education, transportation, rescue, and job opportunities in their isolated community.
High
up in the far-flung regions of the Indian Himalaya lies a small,
isolated town called Padum.  Padum is virtually inaccessible for
eight months of the year, due to winter snowfall.  As we found out first hand, this makes some aspects of life challenging.
Last
February, we travelled 100km on foot up the frozen Zanskar River to volunteer our
ski instructing services to the Zanskar Ski School, a small
non-profit school set up to teach the children of this remote
region how to ski – an incredibly valuable skill for people who are
surrounded by some of the highest snow-covered peaks in the world.
However,
we quickly realised that to truly advance in the art of skiing, the students need to visit an established ski area: there is a limit to how much skiing can be
learnt on a 150m long homemade piste with no lift! 
During
the long, chilly evenings a new dream was born: to bring a group of
the most motivated ski students from Padum to the Indian ski resort
of Gulmarg, where they will benefit from:


Advice from avalanche
	professionals


Two weeks of ski instruction


A gondola


Life
	skills with the potential to benefit the whole community


This
is an opportunity that these children may never have again. Life in
Padum continues as it has for centuries, and most of the children who
stand to benefit from this project have never left their remote
corner of the Himalaya before.
Why is this important?


The
Zanskar Ski School, founded by British Geologist Ben and Zanskar's Outdoor Education Instructor Amin, aims: 

“To
provide
communication, transportation, rescue and job opportunities for the
people of the Zanskar Himalaya through skiing"".
As
you can see from their website, www.zanskarskischool.org,
they
do a fantastic job with limited resources.  Urgain, our host while visiting Padum and also the energetic in-situ manager of the Zanskar Ski School gives as much time as he can to skiing while juggling his family life and own business too.  However, without our help
they may not be able to make their long-term dream a reality.  We
have an opportunity here to change winter-life in Padum for the
better for generations to come.

Learning to ski effectively really
can revolutionise communication links and transportation in this
remote and isolated town.  The five dedicated students that we bring
from Padum will return home able to share their knowledge and
experience with the other students.  They will also be able to take
more responsibility in the running of the ski school, ensuring its
continuation.  Their long-term prospects of finding a good job will
be vastly improved, and in the short-term they may be able to travel to school more safely and easily.
For
Cara and I, the deciding moment was when we asked Padma, the 13 year
old daughter of our host in Padum, what she would think about the
possibility of going to Gulmarg to ski.  For a girl who has never
left this remote corner of the Himalaya, and who has hiked for every
ski turn she's ever made, this prospect was mind-blowing.  Her face
was a picture of incredulous excitement, and left us in no doubt
whatsoever.  We would do everything we could to bring these children
to Gulmarg and share the joy and usefulness of skiing with them.
How
Much?
To
achieve our aim we need to raise $3500 Canadian.  This will allow us
to bring five students and their teacher from Padum to Gulmarg.  Any
contributions will only
be used to bring the students.
Cara
and I will be volunteering our time, and funding our own travel
to get to Gulmarg to instruct the students when they arrive.
The
students journey from Padum to Gulmarg and back will involve:


Walking
	well over 100km
	on the frozen Zanskar River, with food costs of CA$500


Four
	flights
	over the mighty Himalaya at CA$1200


300km
	of jeep travel
	on mountain roads, costing CA$500. 
	


Contingency
	plans,
	hotel accommodation, and daily food costs at CA$1300


For
most of these children, this will be their FIRST trip outside of the
region of Ladakh.  It offers opportunities not just to improve their lives through skiing, but
also for personal development in other areas.
YOU
CAN HELP US REACH OUR TARGET AND SHARE THE JOY AND BENEFITS OF SKIING
WITH THESE CHILDREN AND THEIR WIDER COMMUNITY!
Just
$500 is enough to give one student a set of wonderful new skills to share with their community.  We'd like to bring five students and their teacher.  If 350 people donate just $10 each, we will reach our target and make this dream a reality.  Any donation you can

<p>1- <b>Compost</b>: fueled by inputs of abundant and endless supplies of horse and other manures and virtually any waste material from anything that was ever alive. I am currently producing approximately 100 cubic yards per year. I anticipate increasing this number to 1,000-2,000 cubic yards per year minimum. Bear in mind that while this number may seem small compared to big market standards, Taos County has only 33,000 residents across 2,200 square miles.</p>
<p>                                                   <b>To make this</b></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>2- <b>Vermicompost</b>: Worm, worms, worms! This is not some hair brained idea I picked up out of the back of Popular Mechanics, these little guys are a<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> low carbon method of producing a nutrient dense and biologically rich soil conditioner, plant fertilizer and potting soil ingredient. Using pre-composted horse manure and food waste, the resulting product is a diverse blend of available nutrients which promote healthy plant growth. I currently manage approximately 30 pounds of composting worms producing several hundred pounds of vermicompost or worm castings per year. I would like to increase this amount by 10-20 times.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>                      <b>And this- deep, rich worm castings-as good as it gets!</b></p>

<p>3- <b>Biochar</b>: This is the big unknown for me, and really the only thing that is experimental. Essentially Biochar is an agricultural grade charcoal best known from its use in the creation of the Terra Prjeta Soils of the Amazon. It is known to increase the water retention abilities of soil and plays a role in soil nutrient exchange process as well as providing living quarters and a food source for soil fungi and biota. While charcoal production has historically had a nasty reputation of being a polluter, modern technology has virtually eliminated this. If I can not do this cleanly, I will not do it at all. The heat generated from the process can be used to continue the vermicomposting throughout the winter months as well as providing a heat source for winter greenhouse production. Inputs for this are any non-lumber woody debris that are currently disposed of for a fee at the county landfill. Here are a couple of links to wiki pages if you would like more information on this. </p>

<p>                                            </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">4- <b>Potting Soil and Raised Bed Mixes</b>: I have spent considerable effort in experimenting and refining several potting soil mixes and a raised bed mix to create a locally produced product for the regional market to replace products shipped in from abroad utilizing personally produced and regionally sourced materials. Everything I make and everything I source is up to National Organic Program (NOP) standards with the goal of OMRI labeling the final destination. As good as these products are now, they will only get better with time. I am always learning and fine tuning. Im  always making it better.</span></p>

<p><b>3 months prior to this photo being taken, this plot of land was hard packed sand and gravel. With the addition of copious amounts of my compost, this is the result.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>5-<b>Jobs:</b> Because we need them and I can't do this alone. I anticipate the creation of 3-6 full time, living wage or better jobs within 12 months.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This really is about having a positive impact on the world, reducing our needs on fossil fuels, promoting locally and regionally produced materials to aid the average gardener in their quest to provide a sustainable life for their own families, and to reuse the vast amount of organic matter and soil nutrients that are currently being wasted.</p>
<p>Nothing I am talking about here is really revolutionary or ground breaking. Systems like these are popping up all over the nation. For good reason. Help me bring this to Northern New Mexico.</p>

This little guy is what is going to be loading the dump truck. Unfortunately most horse facilities in the area don't have their own tractor to load trucks with so I will do it for them - $18,000-$23,000.

<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Initial purchase of

If the goal is not reached, they take 9%……The total of items above except for fuel, insurance and rent comes in at about $88,000. This is not leaving much room for error on my part. Fortunately I am surrounded by a host of intelligent and successful business people to act as a sort of board of directors and to help me make sound decisions. </p><p>I would actually love to raise a little more then my goal is set for.

I am also running a short campaign time. </p><p>The season for growing is nearly upon us, my phone is ringing and I can not keep up with the demand! Let's get this thing going!</p><p></p><p>I am doing the flexible funding option so whatever I raise, regardless of whether I hit the goal or not will be put towards making portions of this project happen. If I do not  hit the goal what I do is really dependent on what I raise. The first thing I will do is purchase a small tractor and trailer, increase the carrying capacity on my truck and unload the material by hand. Beginning with composting, I will grow the other aspects one step at a time.  With a little more influx I will begin bagging soil blends. Next I will add in the biochar production and finally, the expansion of the vermicomposting.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p><b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">PSSST</span>……<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...</span></b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I have kept if fairly quite outside of town but some who know me may have picked up hints of what Ive been doing over the last several months.

Its been a ton of work but anyone that has any knowledge about agriculture and food production knows this. Its been countless hours without compensation but it is something that I absolutely love, growing food and helping others to do the same. I brought it up to the break even point by the end of the season but at this point everything is coming out of my pocket to keep it moving forward.

Bear in mind that while this number may seem small compared to big market standards, Taos County has only 33,000 residents across 2,200 square miles.
                                                   To make this



2- Vermicompost: Worm, worms, worms! This is not some hair brained idea I picked up out of the back of Popular Mechanics, these little guys are a low carbon method of producing a nutrient dense and biologically rich soil conditioner, plant fertilizer and potting soil ingredient. Using pre-composted horse manure and food waste, the resulting product is a diverse blend of available nutrients which promote healthy plant growth. I currently manage approximately 30 pounds of composting worms producing several hundred pounds of vermicompost or worm castings per year. I would like to increase this amount by 10-20 times.

                      And this- deep, rich worm castings-as good as it gets!

3- Biochar: This is the big unknown for me, and really the only thing that is experimental. Essentially Biochar is an agricultural grade charcoal best known from its use in the creation of the Terra Prjeta Soils of the Amazon. It is known to increase the water retention abilities of soil and plays a role in soil nutrient exchange process as well as providing living quarters and a food source for soil fungi and biota. While charcoal production has historically had a nasty reputation of being a polluter, modern technology has virtually eliminated this. If I can not do this cleanly, I will not do it at all. The heat generated from the process can be used to continue the vermicomposting throughout the winter months as well as providing a heat source for winter greenhouse production. Inputs for this are any non-lumber woody debris that are currently disposed of for a fee at the county landfill. Here are a couple of links to wiki pages if you would like more information on this. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta
                                            
4- Potting Soil and Raised Bed Mixes: I have spent considerable effort in experimenting and refining several potting soil mixes and a raised bed mix to create a locally produced product for the regional market to replace products shipped in from abroad utilizing personally produced and regionally sourced materials. Everything I make and everything I source is up to National Organic Program (NOP) standards with the goal of OMRI labeling the final destination. As good as these products are now, they will only get better with time. I am always learning and fine tuning. Im  always making it better.

                                               To accomplish something like this

3 months prior to this photo being taken, this plot of land was hard packed sand and gravel. With the addition of copious amounts of my compost, this is the result.

5-Jobs: Because we need them and I can't do this alone. I anticipate the creation of 3-6 full time, living wage or better jobs within 12 months.

This really is about having a positive impact on the world, reducing our needs on fossil fuels, promoting locally and regionally produced materials to aid the average gardener in their quest to provide a sustainable life for their own families, and to reuse the vast amount of organic matter and soil nutrients that are currently being wasted.
Nothing I am talking about here is really revolutionary or ground breaking. Systems like these are popping up all over the nation. For good reason. Help me bring this to Northern New Mexico.

What I Need & What You Get
Yes, that is a big number
I'm trying to raise. Here is what I need to make this happen:
· 
Dump truck-capable of
carrying a minimum of 14 cubic yards of material. This is going to run in the $10,000-$15,000 range for a good used truck.Something like this · 
Flatbed trailer-to
pull behind the dump truck- The one pictured here is about $2,800.  

· 
Small tractor to load
materials into the dump truck- This is the place i don't want to skimp. At the end of the day, this is going to be the workhorse that keeps things moving when big things invariably break down. This little guy is what is going to be loading the dump truck. Unfortunately most horse facilities in the area don't have their own tractor to load trucks with so I will do it for them - $18,000-$23,000. Something like this Kobuta but without the back hoe attachment.

· 
Large front end loader-on the production grounds to turn the piles- Theres a really good deal on craigslist right now on a big articulating end loader with a 3 yard bucket to make short work and really make the job efficient. Can I live without this? Yeah, but I am all efficiency and the bucket on this machine moves about 9 times the amount of material per motion as the little orange one above. This one is listed at $17,500. 

·  Containers
to haul restaurant waste- this can range anywhere from several hundred 5 gallon bucket with lids that restaurants and individuals can put food waste into for regular pick up, to standard 3 yard metal bins for larger consumers- A food grade bucket with a screw on lid is $20 retail. I can get them wholesale for $12. At 100 buckets- $1,200 

· Biochar kiln- Materials and welding labor- $4,300

· Worm stock- $160 shipped per ten pounds. 300 pounds- $4,800· Continuous flow harvesting beds for vermicompost- 420 square feet- 4 beds @3'x35'-built on site- $4,500· Temperature and
Moisture Probes- $500

· 
Material sifter,
hopper, mixer and bagger- Its obscene how much these things cost out of a factory. I found some used for about $35,000 but that is not feasible for me. A custom made unit manufactured on-site- $6,000· Wood chipper- A PTO driven NorTrak that can handle a 5 1/2"" diameter branch, delivered- $2500. 

· 
Fuel……..

· 
Insurance- Im still working out the details of this with the insurance company. Last year the $1,000,000 in liability I carried on the farm ran $155/mo. Its likely going to double or more adding in the machinery to the premises. 

· 
Initial purchase of
non-produced materials for potting mix- Without getting into proprietary details about whats going in the mixes that I don't make on site- $11,488. This is enough material for 3,600/1.5 cubic foot bags of soil mixes, or 200 cubic yards.

· 
Packaging- 5,000 bags- $2,600
· 
Marketing- This is really a pretty moderate expense. Much of this will be sold direct at the farm as well as at the farmers market along side the farms spring seedlings and produce. Im budgeting $1,500 for marketing costs as well as for labeling on the packaging.

· 
Rent/Location- $12,000 per year. This expense is actually covered off of income generated by the farms market garden and seedling/transplants sales. · And a very little bit of padding. If the goal is reached, Indiegogo takes a 4% cut leaving $96,000. If the goal is not reached, they take 9%……The total of items above except for fuel, insurance and rent comes in at about $88,000. This is not leaving much room for error on my part. Fortunately I am surrounded by a host of intelligent and successful business people to act as a sort of board of directors and to help me make sound decisions. I would actually love to raise a little more then my goal is set for. As much money as it seems like, at the end of the day, for a project of this scale, its not that much. I am also running a short campaign time. The season for growing is nearly upon us, my phone is ringing and I can not keep up with the demand! Let's get this thing going!I am doing the flexible funding option so whatever I raise, regardless of whether I hit the goal or not will be put towards making portions of this project happen. If I do not  hit the goal what I do is really dependent on what I raise. The first thing I will do is purchase a small tractor and trailer, increase the carrying capacity on my truck and unload the material by hand. Beginning with composting, I will grow the other aspects one step at a time.  With a little more influx I will begin bagging soil blends. Next I will add in the biochar production and finally, the expansion of the vermicomposting.PSSST……...I have kept if fairly quite outside of town but some who know me may have picked up hints of what Ive been doing over the last several months. In short, I was given the opportunity to take over the fledgling Blossoms and Sprouts Farm located on the former Blossoms Organic Nursery property last July. Its been a ton of work but anyone that has any knowledge about agriculture and food production knows this. Its been countless hours without compensation but it is something that I absolutely love, growing food and helping others to do the same. I brought it up to the break even point by the end of the season but at this point everything is coming out of my pocket to keep it moving forward. Vish and Uma Miller, the property owners are 100% behind both the farm and this project. They have been more then gracious in working with me to keep moving forward. This is an incredible location and platform. Really, this is a world class location to create a model for sustainable, manageable, self sufficient agriculture.                               https://www.facebook.com/blossomsandsprouts                                                       Mid summer marketI am excited to begin announcing that I have submitted the application for Certified Organic Certification for vegetable and herb seedlings and transplants through the state of New Mexico! This is an entirely out of pocket investment.
The Impact.Remember, I am already doing this albeit on a very minor scale. I am producing about 100 cubic yards of compost and a few hundred pounds of worm castings a year. The worm casts fill my needs as does the majority of the compost. The excess compost I do offer to the public sells without issue or complaint as fast as I can load a yard into the back of my truck, 42/5 gallon buckets at a time. What I'm doing now is going to make it available to everyone in my region while recycling literally tons of organic material that will otherwise go to landfills or rot in a pile behind a barn.$5 goes a long way- I have an incredible network of friends around the world.....spread this around.......PLEASE. Seriously, I want 20,000 people to pitch in 5 bucks….that is all it takes. We can do this.If you dont have a few bucks to throw into the pot, please just copy and paste this into a message or update your status on facebook, tweet the link, whatever. GET THE WORD OUT! I need everyone's help to do this! Expect me to pester you :) The sooner I raise these funds the sooner I stop bugging everyone and get to work on this before the start of gardening season here.Thank You!OK, about the perks. 1- Its going to take time to bring all of this together. Im hoping to have much available product ready for spring planting but the reality is, is that much may not be ready until well into the summer. This project is about looking forward, your patience and forward glance is appreciated. 2-As much as I would love for my local community to enable me to do this without any outside contributions, I just don't see that being a possibility. I expect (hope) to receive many contributions from outside of the region. Due to the nature of the items being produced, shipment to out of area contributors is not feasible. Im quite happy to package up and ship your physical contribution to you so long as shipping fees are paid on your end. My plan is to combine all the outside contributions into increments of $1,000 and at local schools, nursing homes, homeless shelters etc, build raised bed gardens and plant vegetable seedlings in them. Does that seem reasonable?3- Regular updates- I have created a page on Facebook to post updates and show the progress of what is happening. Updates will also be posted on the Blossoms & Sprouts Farm page…..please ""like"" us too! You deserve to know!4- Education- I'm generous with what I know and share it readily. Do you or someone you know want to build something like this for your own community? Come and learn here!NOTE TO REGIONAL LIVESTOCK OWNERS: I will be doing regular pickups of animal and agricultural waste free of charge. Your contributions to this project will ensure your days of trying to get rid of your manure piles are over.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3><p>Nutriunt will be a local organic exotic aquaponic farm that offers exotic variety. Instead of traveling miles to get to your plate, it will be possible to have it travel from farm to fork. We couldn't be more proud in that we will be providing produce and fish to our community that will be grown using the efficiency of aquaponics, free from pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, GMO’s, and growth hormones.

Aquaponics is hydroponics married with aquaculture, a sustainable ecosystem. The fish waste is converted into plant food on a biological level. In turn the plants filter the nitrates from the water to foster, while neutralizing and purifying the water for the fish. This means the crop will have an unaltered steady stream of natural organic nutrients.</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center; line-height: 23.200000762939453px;"">

Quality: </b>Being able to yield more crop per acre compared to conventional
farming, we will be able to meet a demand in the city center while having a
near zero carbon foot print. Nutriunt will not be using any expensive equipment to harvest our all natural crop. By purchasing from local farmers you will also
avoid adding exhaust to our atmosphere because there will be merely no gap
between the farm and your door step. They say our food currently travels hundreds of miles just to get to our
dinner plate. Shopping local has shown so much success and is beneficial to society and our communities in the
long run.</p>
<p><b>Water: </b>Aquaponics
uses a fraction of the water that conventional farming uses and yields 8 times
as much food making it possible to conserve thousands of gallons a year.
Conventional farming also uses 70% of our current fresh water. Herbicides and
pesticides that are applied to the plants wash out into our rivers and oceans,
creating dead zones where aquatic life is nonexistent. </p>
<p><b>Community:</b> As
local farms grow new jobs become available in our local economy! By
dramatically reducing the financial burden and reliance on fossil fuel based
transport, chemical inputs, and refrigeration, more funding can stay in local
urban economies where food is produced. Things become more personable when you
shop local. The opportunity to meet your farmers and visit the place your crops
are cultivated becomes feasible and never cumbersome.</p>
<p><b>Health: </b>Even
though they say that the pesticides used are “organic” on organic crops,
doesn't mean it is in any way shape or form harmless. Another thing that is disheartening is that most of the ""organic"" food that we eat to avoid the ""junk"" companies, is owned by the junk companies! Some of the most harmful things on earth are invisible to the naked eye. Over 300,000 farm workers get
sick every year because of the use of pesticides. Based on studies
conducted by a multi-university research team in Toronto concludes that
""people should reduce their exposure to pesticides because of links to
serious illnesses"". Results of this study found consistent evidence of serious
health risks such as cancer, nervous system diseases and reproductive problems
in people exposed to pesticides…through home and garden exposure. </p><p></p>
<b>Environment:
</b>Chemical fertilizers destroy the properties of soil
rendering it incapable of supporting plant life. By supporting Nutriunt, you
will also aid in cutting back on deforestation. You heard that right!
Conventional farming at this present time is the number one contributor to deforestation. We all know that our trees are essential in battling poor air
quality. Researchers claim that we farm a landmass the size of South America.
Farming indoors also eliminates the need to rely on fossil fuels for seeding,
fertilizing, weeding, harvesting, and plowing! It will also give us the ability
to avoid pests which prevents us from using any excessive harmful chemicals at
all. Not adding or bringing any other harmful substances to the city.<br/><p></p><p></p>

<b>Does aquaponic produce taste different than soil?</b> In my honest opinion, no. I have tasted aquaponic lettuce and tomatoes side by side. I was unable to tell which source either one of them came from. At times aquaponic produce seemed to be more colorful and tasty. </li></ul><p><b><br/></b></p><ul><li>
<b>Can we get e coli and salmonella from aquaponics?</b> The simple fact that fish aren't warm blooded animals makes it impossible to contract any kind of bacteria in that form or even leach it in our system. If we were to introduce any kind of warm blooded animal excrement or fertilizers into our system, then there would be many risks taken going that route.</li></ul><p><br/></p><ul><li>
<b>Will you grow other things in the future?</b> This is always a favorite question. We couldn't be more ecstatic to offer different varieties of produce as we grow in the community. That is one of our ultimate goals.</li></ul><p><br/></p><ul><li>
<b>Are indoor crops healthier? </b>Yes, they can be because you aren't forced to use any pesticides, herbicides, or any kind of chemicals to fend off pests and enrich the soil. At the same time we are able to closely monitor the crop environment.</li></ul><p><br/></p><ul><li>
<b>How does aquaponics use less water? </b>By using a closed loop system and continuously re-circulating the same water.<b> </b>That makes it possible to reuse 97% of our water.</li></ul><p><br/></p><ul><li>
<b>I heard you don't get all of the proper nutrients through aquaponics. Will your produce be nutrient deficient? </b>No. With Nutriunt's system design, we will optimize nutrient production. We will accomplish this by adding worms to help break down the fish solids. Worms are a remarkable asset to the ecosystem. They house special enzymes in their digestive tract that break down other valuable nutrients in the system, maximizing nutrient absorption for the plants.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About the Founder</h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Hello, my name is
Jacolby Cross. I am from New Orleans, LA and raised in San Diego, CA. I am
currently active duty Coast Guard. I have served for over 7 years as an AMT (Aviation
Maintenance Technician) on the MH60J/T (Helicopter) and C130H (Four prop cargo
plane), and have had the pleasure of serving in numerous places. New Jersey,
North Carolina, all over Alaska, Florida, Bahamas, Haiti, Turks &amp; Caicos,
Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Dominica Republic. When I first moved to Florida I
was growing all natural produce for myself and soon after was growing for some
friends and a few neighbors on my patio garden it St. Petersburg, FL. It was
aggravating playing the guessing game of where our food was coming from and
what was used to grow it. I was also very fond of exotic fruits and veggies. I was starting to run out of space for the pots and soil as
requests grew. I knew nothing about aquaponics at the time. I had come across
it in an article and read more on it. As soon as I gave it a try I was hooked
and soon after, I revamped my patio garden. I was able to grow almost 4 times
what I was growing with aquaponics than soil with the little bit of space that
I had on my patio. As we all know, there are many entities that make things harder than
they need to be. The contents of our food shouldn't be a mystery! The
idea of Nutriunt was born because the demand kept growing. The neighbors and I weren't the only ones seeking good quality pure produce! That's when my love for healthy eating spliced with the need to do better ignited. I found myself yelling at the T.V. often. So I decided I wanted to do something in my own special way, to contribute to the solution against this epidemic of diseased food! So now
I'm looking for outgoing healthy folks that want to see my endeavor come alive and would love to take advantage of clean  produce variety!
Thank you so much for taking the time! I look forward to meeting you in the
near future.</i></p><p></p><p></p>

<p></p></div>","What is Nutriunt? 
Nutriunt will be a local organic exotic aquaponic farm that offers exotic variety. Instead of traveling miles to get to your plate, it will be possible to have it travel from farm to fork. We couldn't be more proud in that we will be providing produce and fish to our community that will be grown using the efficiency of aquaponics, free from pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, GMO’s, and growth hormones. Nutriunt will always live by the definition of what it truly means to be organic and pure. How we will accomplish this? What is going to make all of this possible is the amazing ability of aquaponics and growing in a lovely greenhouse. Aquaponics is hydroponics married with aquaculture, a sustainable ecosystem. The fish waste is converted into plant food on a biological level. In turn the plants filter the nitrates from the water to foster, while neutralizing and purifying the water for the fish. This means the crop will have an unaltered steady stream of natural organic nutrients.
Aquaponics:
Nutriunt's Goal  The Nutriunt team is trying to raise $7,000, but we are looking to shatter that with your support! Every dollar is going to be used for everything from the seed to the structure! Even if we don't meet our funding goal, we are going to make due with what we are able to raise. If we raise more than our target goal we will be able to expand the design of the growing system to offer even more organic heirloom varieties. With the current system design we will be able to produce a combination of over 1,000 heads of lettuce, leafy greens, bunches of basil, and a variety of fruits and vegetables monthly.Where your money is going?

Quality: Being able to yield more crop per acre compared to conventional
farming, we will be able to meet a demand in the city center while having a
near zero carbon foot print. Nutriunt will not be using any expensive equipment to harvest our all natural crop. By purchasing from local farmers you will also
avoid adding exhaust to our atmosphere because there will be merely no gap
between the farm and your door step. They say our food currently travels hundreds of miles just to get to our
dinner plate. Shopping local has shown so much success and is beneficial to society and our communities in the
long run.
Water: Aquaponics
uses a fraction of the water that conventional farming uses and yields 8 times
as much food making it possible to conserve thousands of gallons a year.
Conventional farming also uses 70% of our current fresh water. Herbicides and
pesticides that are applied to the plants wash out into our rivers and oceans,
creating dead zones where aquatic life is nonexistent. 
Community: As
local farms grow new jobs become available in our local economy! By
dramatically reducing the financial burden and reliance on fossil fuel based
transport, chemical inputs, and refrigeration, more funding can stay in local
urban economies where food is produced. Things become more personable when you
shop local. The opportunity to meet your farmers and visit the place your crops
are cultivated becomes feasible and never cumbersome.
Health: Even
though they say that the pesticides used are “organic” on organic crops,
doesn't mean it is in any way shape or form harmless. Another thing that is disheartening is that most of the ""organic"" food that we eat to avoid the ""junk"" companies, is owned by the junk companies! Some of the most harmful things on earth are invisible to the naked eye. Over 300,000 farm workers get
sick every year because of the use of pesticides. Based on studies
conducted by a multi-university research team in Toronto concludes that
""people should reduce their exposure to pesticides because of links to
serious illnesses"". Results of this study found consistent evidence of serious
health risks such as cancer, nervous system diseases and reproductive problems
in people exposed to pesticides…through home and garden exposure. 
Environment:
Chemical fertilizers destroy the properties of soil
rendering it incapable of supporting plant life. By supporting Nutriunt, you
will also aid in cutting back on deforestation. You heard that right!
Conventional farming at this present time is the number one contributor to deforestation. We all know that our trees are essential in battling poor air
quality. Researchers claim that we farm a landmass the size of South America.
Farming indoors also eliminates the need to rely on fossil fuels for seeding,
fertilizing, weeding, harvesting, and plowing! It will also give us the ability
to avoid pests which prevents us from using any excessive harmful chemicals at
all. Not adding or bringing any other harmful substances to the city.
Other Ways You Can Help It you are unable to contribute is no problem at all. The fact that you took the time out of your day to check out the Nutriunt funding campaign is greatly appreciated. A way that you can still help us succeed if you cannot contribute is using our links and sharing our campaign with your friends and family! Thanks again for taking the time. Frequently Asked Questions:
Does aquaponic produce taste different than soil? In my honest opinion, no. I have tasted aquaponic lettuce and tomatoes side by side. I was unable to tell which source either one of them came from. At times aquaponic produce seemed to be more colorful and tasty. 
Can we get e coli and salmonella from aquaponics? The simple fact that fish aren't warm blooded animals makes it impossible to contract any kind of bacteria in that form or even leach it in our system. If we were to introduce any kind of warm blooded animal excrement or fertilizers into our system, then there would be many risks taken going that route.
Will you grow other things in the future? This is always a favorite question. We couldn't be more ecstatic to offer different varieties of produce as we grow in the community. That is one of our ultimate goals.
Are indoor crops healthier? Yes, they can be because you aren't forced to use any pesticides, herbicides, or any kind of chemicals to fend off pests and enrich the soil. At the same time we are able to closely monitor the crop environment.
How does aquaponics use less water? By using a closed loop system and continuously re-circulating the same water. That makes it possible to reuse 97% of our water.
I heard you don't get all of the proper nutrients through aquaponics. Will your produce be nutrient deficient? No. With Nutriunt's system design, we will optimize nutrient production. We will accomplish this by adding worms to help break down the fish solids. Worms are a remarkable asset to the ecosystem. They house special enzymes in their digestive tract that break down other valuable nutrients in the system, maximizing nutrient absorption for the plants.About the Founder
Hello, my name is
Jacolby Cross. I am from New Orleans, LA and raised in San Diego, CA. I am
currently active duty Coast Guard. I have served for over 7 years as an AMT (Aviation
Maintenance Technician) on the MH60J/T (Helicopter) and C130H (Four prop cargo
plane), and have had the pleasure of serving in numerous places. New Jersey,
North Carolina, all over Alaska, Florida, Bahamas, Haiti, Turks & Caicos,
Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Dominica Republic. When I first moved to Florida I
was growing all natural produce for myself and soon after was growing for some
friends and a few neighbors on my patio garden it St. Petersburg, FL. It was
aggravating playing the guessing game of where our food was coming from and
what was used to grow it. I was also very fond of exotic fruits and veggies. I was starting to run out of space for the pots and soil as
requests grew. I knew nothing about aquaponics at the time. I had come across
it in an article and read more on it. As soon as I gave it a try I was hooked
and soon after, I revamped my patio garden. I was able to grow almost 4 times
what I was growing with aquaponics than soil with the little bit of space that
I had on my patio. As we all know, there are many entities that make things harder than
they need to be. The contents of our food shouldn't be a mystery! The
idea of Nutriunt was born because the demand kept growing. The neighbors and I weren't the only ones seeking good quality pure produce! That's when my love for healthy eating spliced with the need to do better ignited. I found myself yelling at the T.V. often. So I decided I wanted to do something in my own special way, to contribute to the solution against this epidemic of diseased food! So now
I'm looking for outgoing healthy folks that want to see my endeavor come alive and would love to take advantage of clean  produce variety!
Thank you so much for taking the time! I look forward to meeting you in the
near future.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In addition, Red Line 5ive &amp; Dime will carry new clothing at a discount price and other urban essentials such as good incense, candles, mustache wax, Taschen coffee table books, battery operated Chinese good luck waving kitties, local small press cards, prints and t-shirts and other stuff that I like to be surrounded by.</p>
<p>Red Line 5ive &amp; Dime will also partner with local arts oriented not for profits offering them the opportunity to display their work and generate vital income ensuring the continuation of their organizations.</p>
<p>The $6,500 I'm looking to raise will cover security and at least one month's rent, build out (paint, fixtures, etc.), insurance, the first two months of utilities,  a good graphic/logo designed, new and new to you product (approximately 1,000 pieces) and ""hype.""

</p><p>My name is Kellie Sipos, and I am the founder and executive
director of a small not-for-profit 501 c 3 that has the awesome privilege of
witnessing miracles every day. Saddle Up Riding Club offers equine assisted
therapy to disabled children, adults and veterans, as well as reaching out to
the able-bodied community with safe, affordable, educational classes on horse
care and safety.</p>
<p>Saddle Up became incorporated ten years ago, founded with
the purpose of teaching children compassion, commitment, teamwork and good
sportsmanship. We are now an equine therapy program that reaches fifty disabled
riders/and or veterans a week. Fifteen to twenty children are in structured
horseback riding programs, homeschool groups, school field trips and private
functions for organizations. Saddle Up has also partnered with the Pinellas
County Juvenile Welfare Board, working with at-risk youth offering community
service opportunities instead of “doing time” in juvenile detention centers. Many
of these children have merely made poor choices, and are primarily need of an opportunity
for redeeming themselves.</p>
<p>We at Saddle Up function as a family: we have fifteen to
twenty core senior volunteers that assist us weekly with therapy sessions.  We have fathers of riders who spend hours every
week volunteering their time and energy by helping with grounds maintenance and
repairs to boards.  We have instructors
that teach because of their love of children and horses, not for the money. Our
“Equine Assisted Therapy Program” is supervised by a board-certified behavior
specialist, and therapeutic instructors who must be trained and certified
through PATH to be qualified to teach. “Hugs are the highlight of our
Saturdays,” is a common refrain, and Melissa and I receive them from riders and
parents alike. Many of our clients have now been with us for five years, and we
have witnessed them develope strength, self-esteem and belief in themselves and
what they can accomplish. Some, unfortunately, we have lost as God has called
them to be with Him.  We know that we are
the highlight of the week for most. Even the nonverbal riders wear huge smiles,
make happy noises, or simply hug us when they arrive and when they leave.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are at risk of loosing all of this; we
have fought hard, but seem to be faced with one trial after another. Loosing our
facility after six years of a continuous lease because of an arbitrary landlord
was the hardest blow of all. We need to purchase a property in order to secure
the future of this vital organization. We are currently living on a temporary
property where all the horses are out in the elements. Our programs can only
operate at a minimal level, and the necessary structure for our therapy riders
and horses is becoming more difficult to maintain week after week, as we deal
with the unpredictable, unseasonal winter rains and sporadic cool weather. Worse
to come is in May with the summer rains, when the property we are on will be
flooded. We must purchase the land we have found immediately! Lenders are in
place, but we can barely maintain the horses financially, let alone raise
$80,000 for the down payment. We need all of you; we need many hands to dig
deep to help us overcome this financial hurdle!</p>
<p>HOW CAN YOU HELP AND WHAT DO YOU GET?</p>
<p>Our campaign consists of four phases, but we are currently
working on funding for each phase one at a time. Our immediate need is the
$80,000 for the down payment along with our offer on two beautiful acres in the
middle of Pinellas County. We chose this property because it is an easy
location to find, and has an adjoining, additional two acres that we can
purchase after the loan on the first two acres is paid off. This property is
beautifully set with trees for shade and has an easy access from the main
roads. The property is at fair market value and the owner is willing to accommodate
us.</p>
<p>If we cannot raise this $80,000, we may have to sell our
horses and lose this greatly needed service to our veterans, children and
adults. Saddle Up is the only center of its kind in Pinellas County. Other
facilities work with children, many with disabled riders, and a few work exclusively
with veterans, but only Saddle Up offers so many services to all such
categories in need. We are a sanctioned PATH Center, one of 900 nationwide. We
must follow strict guidelines and mandates to keep the PATH logo displayed on
our property. Saddle Up opens its doors to the public each month, offering
horse rides, chances to interact with our farm animals, have hay rides and offer
wholesome family fun. For those living in the most densely populated county in
the state of Florida, educating children on farm animals has become a rare
experience.</p>
<p>For years when we were short financially we held
fundraisers, and on occasion my husband and I would personally fund activities.
We are no longer financially able to do this, and fundraising is difficult when
there is no property where we can hold events. Crowd-funding appears to be our
only option. Each and every one of you has become our only hope.</p>
<p>Saddle up will be able to move our horses into temporary
housing once we have purchased the new property. A building campaign will then
begin to raise the barn, covered arena and sensory riding trails.  On May 9 – 11<sup>th</sup> we are hosting the
Royal Lipizzan Stallions for a three night event, and feel confident we can
raise the funds for the building through this event. By June 1<sup>st</sup> we
could be on a permanent property ready to hold camps for the summer and allow
programs to operate ~ rain or shine ~ seven days a week.</p>
<p>We understand times are tight, and perhaps you have read
this and want to give, but just do not have any extra finances in your budget.
If that is so, you can still help by sharing this campaign with your friends. Help
us “make some noise” about our campaign; Indiegogo has great sharing tools.
Each of you, no matter where you live, can make a difference in the life of a
person with a disability; will you do that today? Your donations are tax
deductible, as we are a 501 c 3 listed with the IRS.  Please don’t make the mistake of thinking
someone else will provide help, as all too often everyone thinks someone else
will give, but then no one does.  Be that
unique person, take a stand for our disabled citizens and veterans, give what
you can, and provide a legacy for generations to come. For more information on

repairs to boards.  We have instructors
that teach because of their love of children and horses, not for the money. Our
“Equine Assisted Therapy Program” is supervised by a board-certified behavior
specialist, and therapeutic instructors who must be trained and certified
through PATH to be qualified to teach. “Hugs are the highlight of our
Saturdays,” is a common refrain, and Melissa and I receive them from riders and
parents alike. Many of our clients have now been with us for five years, and we
have witnessed them develope strength, self-esteem and belief in themselves and
what they can accomplish. Some, unfortunately, we have lost as God has called
them to be with Him.  We know that we are
the highlight of the week for most. Even the nonverbal riders wear huge smiles,
make happy noises, or simply hug us when they arrive and when they leave.
Unfortunately, we are at risk of loosing all of this; we
have fought hard, but seem to be faced with one trial after another. Loosing our
facility after six years of a continuous lease because of an arbitrary landlord
was the hardest blow of all. We need to purchase a property in order to secure
the future of this vital organization. We are currently living on a temporary
property where all the horses are out in the elements. Our programs can only
operate at a minimal level, and the necessary structure for our therapy riders
and horses is becoming more difficult to maintain week after week, as we deal
with the unpredictable, unseasonal winter rains and sporadic cool weather. Worse
to come is in May with the summer rains, when the property we are on will be
flooded. We must purchase the land we have found immediately! Lenders are in
place, but we can barely maintain the horses financially, let alone raise
$80,000 for the down payment. We need all of you; we need many hands to dig
deep to help us overcome this financial hurdle!
HOW CAN YOU HELP AND WHAT DO YOU GET?
Our campaign consists of four phases, but we are currently
working on funding for each phase one at a time. Our immediate need is the
$80,000 for the down payment along with our offer on two beautiful acres in the
middle of Pinellas County. We chose this property because it is an easy
location to find, and has an adjoining, additional two acres that we can
purchase after the loan on the first two acres is paid off. This property is
beautifully set with trees for shade and has an easy access from the main
roads. The property is at fair market value and the owner is willing to accommodate
us.
If we cannot raise this $80,000, we may have to sell our
horses and lose this greatly needed service to our veterans, children and
adults. Saddle Up is the only center of its kind in Pinellas County. Other
facilities work with children, many with disabled riders, and a few work exclusively
with veterans, but only Saddle Up offers so many services to all such
categories in need. We are a sanctioned PATH Center, one of 900 nationwide. We
must follow strict guidelines and mandates to keep the PATH logo displayed on
our property. Saddle Up opens its doors to the public each month, offering
horse rides, chances to interact with our farm animals, have hay rides and offer
wholesome family fun. For those living in the most densely populated county in
the state of Florida, educating children on farm animals has become a rare
experience.
For years when we were short financially we held
fundraisers, and on occasion my husband and I would personally fund activities.
We are no longer financially able to do this, and fundraising is difficult when
there is no property where we can hold events. Crowd-funding appears to be our
only option. Each and every one of you has become our only hope.
Saddle up will be able to move our horses into temporary
housing once we have purchased the new property. A building campaign will then
begin to raise the barn, covered arena and sensory riding trails.  On May 9 – 11th we are hosting the
Royal Lipizzan Stallions for a three night event, and feel confident we can
raise the funds for the building through this event. By June 1st we
could be on a permanent property ready to hold camps for the summer and allow
programs to operate ~ rain or shine ~ seven days a week.
We understand times are tight, and perhaps you have read
this and want to give, but just do not have any extra finances in your budget.
If that is so, you can still help by sharing this campaign with your friends. Help
us “make some noise” about our campaign; Indiegogo has great sharing tools.
Each of you, no matter where you live, can make a difference in the life of a
person with a disability; will you do that today? Your donations are tax
deductible, as we are a 501 c 3 listed with the IRS.  Please don’t make the mistake of thinking
someone else will provide help, as all too often everyone thinks someone else
will give, but then no one does.  Be that
unique person, take a stand for our disabled citizens and veterans, give what
you can, and provide a legacy for generations to come. For more information on

<p><b>OUR QUESTION FOR YOU?</b></p>
<p>Where did you ever have your best meals growing up? If you were like my partner, Jerry and I, it was probably at your mama’s table. It’s for that reason it was easy for us to name our small restaurant in Sorgho, Ky., exactly that, Mama’s Table, a one of a kind home cooking, stick to your ribs kind of dining experience. (please feel free to like us on Facebook, Mama's Table)</p>
<p><b>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT US!</b></p>
<p>Jerry and I have combined experience of more than 70 years in food service, hospitality, or the related services arena. We understand hospitality, quality, and service are all paramount for a successful food and beverage operation. Mama’s Table was built on that experience. Our restaurant is located in a small community of Sorgho, Ky.,with a population of around 1500. We are  5 miles from Owensboro,Ky., the BBQ Capital of the world (so they claim), and about 30miles from Evansville, In., with many river communities in between, with a total drawing population of around 350,000 in a 30 mile radius. Mama’s Table, once known as Red’s Fish House was a going concern for nearly fifty years. After Red died, we came in and charmed the place up, keeping a great catfish venue, while adding  those dishes that you would expect to get at Mama’s, such as fried pork chops, meatloaf, turnip greens with ham, green beans, loaded red potatoes, slow roasted prime rib, my Mama’s oven fried chicken, hickory smoked Boston Butt, slow smoked for at least 10 hrs. on our smoker and served with our  special dipping sauce unique to Mama’s only, along with outstanding made from scratch desserts. All this plus a world class Omelet Bar, with all the trimmings. But what  makes it extra special is our very own Chef Gil, a staple of our community, flipping omelets in Owensboro for nearly 20 years, and a very special addition to Mama’s. Chef Gil flips omelets on Saturday and Sunday morning left handed and right handed while sharing stories or listening to those of our guest.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL!</b></p>
<p>Now as we start our 3rd year, it's time to take Mama’s Table to the next level. It's time to make her truly a destination restaurant. To do this, we need your help to get there. The following list entails those things necessary to make Mama’s Table a true destination property.</p>
<p>1)  A paved parking lot to replace our gravel and grass</p>
<p>2)  Improved signage</p>
<p>3)  Outdoor stage and large pit to add a bluegrass and country music venue</p>
<p>4)  Enhance our kitchen and patio area</p>
<p>5)  Bring our social media and web presence up to the standards of the 21st century</p>
<p>6)  Fresh produce and herb gardens to ensure our freshness and to maintain a greener presence</p>
<p><b>WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT!</b></p>
<p>For your participation no matter at what level, know it will be truly appreciated, from  $1 to a $5000 donation, any amount will serve to make Mama’s Table a place for which we can all be proud, and a place where each and everyone will always be welcome with open arms and a warm heart.

</div></div>","LifeGuard Center The LifeGuard Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in Tucson, Arizona. Our primary focus is to rescue young people that have no hope and are in need of help. National statistics report the number of homeless kids at more than 1.5 million. More than 500 thousand are still under the age of 15, and some are as young as nine! Some of the primary reasons they end up on the street include an escape from violence, drugs, abuse, neglect and abandonment.

Imagine if you could be the answer for a hurting teen...


Imagine if you could give the gift of Hope to a teen this Christmas...

Imagine saving a life...
You can, by taking part in the IMAGINE Campaign!What We Need:
The LifeGuard Center needs to raise $5,000 to stay open and provide FREE programs for youth. 100% of your financial gift will go towards Scholarships. This will insure that at-risk youth that desire to be apart of the LifeGuard Center will be awarded a scholarship to attend our after school program (Lifeline Project), or our summer camp (Camp Summer Experience) for FREE!!!!Each program the LifeGuard Center provides also includes free performances by the kids to the community. To see the kids faces as their family and friends commend them on there achievements is priceless!
With your support, the Center will stay open and we will be able to serve over 30 kids without turning them away. 



The Impact
A Sponsorship provides more than the satisfaction that
comes with giving to improve the health and well-being of children; it delivers
a special opportunity to witness young lives lifted over time. Through child
sponsorship, two lives are changed forever: yours and the life of the sponsored child. 
Without the continued support of
generous donors like you, the needs of these young people would likely go
unmet. 
People need help all year around but Christmas is a great time to show that people are the best investment we could ever make! Everyone needs to know that someone cares!

We wanted to think of a project that would give us a hands on opportunity to explore our passions. Designing and building a small dune buggy fit this criteria perfectly. Both of us have an interest in engineering and industrial design, an interest that was partially developed through our FTC robotics team. We both love to build and create so this project really gave us the opportunity to take this to a bigger scale.</p><p></p><div>
<b><h1>The Dune Buggy</h1></b><p>The final dune buggy will have on and off road capabilities. It will comfortably seat one person with roll-cage going over the head of the seat.</p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, we will be designing it so it will have differences. The buggy will be controlled by a steering wheel with pedals at the feet controlling the gas and brakes. The drive system will be a live axle in the back powered by a geared down Honda GX200 7 HP engine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to give the buggy some off road ability, the tires will be larger and more aggressively tread than go kart tires. They will most likely be ATV tires or something in that class. The buggy will also be equipped with independent front suspension and full back suspension. Our goal is to have to buggy be just as comfortable and powerful off road as it is on road.</p>
<h1><b>Why We Need You</b></h1>
<p>We need funding for our parts and materials. Being seniors in high school, we have very limited budgets. Getting the money for this project would allow us to focus on the project itself. Being freed from the burden of finding the money for it would help us be able to pursue our career interests and gain priceless experience before heading into college. If you are able to help us out by pledging a few dollars, it would be incredibly appreciated. Also, if you live in the Durham/Chapel Hill area and know anyone with a child ATV that they would be willing to sell for parts, please contact us!  Thanks so much for your support, we couldn't do it without you!</p>

Although the Philippines is slowly recovering, many Filipinos are still struggling to rebuild their houses and businesses.

The Resource Center will provide a place where people with ideas can gather and find support for their projects. It is our goal to give anyone in the community the resources they need and to connect them with various networks to help them establish or expand their business or to rebuild or renew their home or property.</p>

<p>My name is Jack Nightingale and I represent over 150 people among community groups from Southern Belize and the core team of Fruit-Full.  Fruit-Full brand solar dried fruits and Ethical Business Exchange is an innovative and large undertaking with many participants and beneficiaries.  There are two themes:</p>
<p> 1. Ethical Business Exchange, which is the promotion of ethical and conscientious business practices and <br/></p>
<p>2. A model conscientious business of solar dried organic fruits.  <br/></p>

<p>The third world environment in which this campaign
will be achieved is many steps behind the first world.  This is an advantage as
well as a detraction.  Capitalism is a world wide tool for development.  It has been poorly used for selfish ends everywhere.  However, used properly and ethically, it can be of great benefit to the entire world.  The tools exist in ethically and conscience based business models.  Our Ethical Business Exchange will produce and implement seminars, presentations, trainings and consultancies in Belize and Central America. <a href=""http://fruit-full.com/wp/?page_id=30"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check our website for more details </a><br/></p>

<p>The organic and quality solar dried fruits business has been established locally and must export its products to become well used and financially useful.  The steps mandated to export our products require physical and practical modifications to meet industry standards.  The products must be well presented in quality packaging.  Bar coding and licenses must be acquired.  International markets must be developed.  Samples must be manufactured and exported to the market place. These are the objectives for this effort. <a href=""http://fruit-full.com/wp/?page_id=24"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check our website for more details </a> <br/></p>

<p>FURTHER DETAILS
CONCERNING FRUIT AND FRUIT DRYING</p>
<p>Tropical fruits are dried in many
fashions. The bulk of dried fruits are soaked in sugar baths before being
electronically timed through an electric furnace. You will know these fruits
because of the white, sweet powder on the surface. Other fruits are passed
through citric acid or sodium benzoate to help preserve them. Sulfur is often
used for a preservative.</p>
<p>We at Fruit-Full use nothing but
the sun!</p>
<p>Tropical fruits are multiple,
from pineapple, banana through to mangosteen. Each has properties that when
consumed are valuable to the cells in your body. At Fruit-Full we can access
about 12 different fruits out of this pantheon of delights. Among them is a
fruit we know as Zapote. Some know it as Mamay- zapote. This fruit is not well
known and to get it is sometimes a difficult task. There is no guarantee that
it will ripen correctly or that bruises from falling do not over damage the
fruit. When dried, coated in honey, it becomes a real sweet treat. The tree is endemic
to our region and the Mayans used it for food. </p>
<p>Getting this fruit and all our
products to you is our goal. As the end user, you are the main beneficiary.
Dried fruits retain nearly all their goodness so that your body can make use of
these delights. </p>
<br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Achieving these objectives will allow local farmers, community groups and the core Fruit-Full team to be effective citizenry in Belize and Central America.  In addition, the Ethical Business Exchange will be encouraging other entrepreneurs to realize their dreams whilst influencing ethics and conscience.  We must all take responsibility for our present and potential futures.  That is why our theme ""Effort to be conscious, is conscious effort"" is calling to you.  Fruit-Full's product motto is, ""Nothing added but the sun"" and we wish to share that with you.</span><br/></p>
