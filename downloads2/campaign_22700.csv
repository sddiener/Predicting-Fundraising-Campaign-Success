<b>TimelessTease Productions</b> is a new Baltimore-based theater-burlesque company, curating a diverse cast of the best and brightest in Baltimore-area burlesque. <p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>TimelessTease Productions</b> was co-founded by Dr. Betty O'Hellno and Dr. Jules V. Moorhead, respectively portrayed by Aaron Barlow and Josh Aterovis.

respected and award-winning husband and wife duo Trixie Little and the Evil Hate Monkey. Since then, he's been
fortunate enough to become friends with many of the local performers over the

<p>Mabou Mines has a long history of fostering the next generation of artists through mentorships and residencies.

<p>From March 27-April 1, 2018 <i>SUITE</i>/Space artists will perform their work in a festival-like setting at the new Mabou Mines Theater in the East Village — 2 performances each night for 6 nights in a row.</p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign not only guarantees you a ticket, but invests directly in the artists' work as well as the future of the program. All income will be shared equally between the <i>SUITE</i>/Space artists and <i>SUITE</i>/Space Program expenses.</p>
<p>For the 2018 inaugural year of the program, <i>SUITE</i>/Space artists were nominated by community and performing arts organizations. The artists were selected by Mabou Mines' curatorial team — Mabou Mines Co-Artistic Director Karen Kandel, Mabou Mines Associate Artist David Neumann, and playwright and former Mabou Mines Resident Artist Carl Hancock Rux. For 2019 and beyond, the <i>SUITE</i>/Space artists will be selected through nominations and a public RFP process.<strong><i> </i></strong></p>

</div><div>
<p>This year, we extend Butoh beyond the boundaries of dance again. Using modern technologies, we will present a holographic performance of 3 legendary Japanese Butoh dancers who, due to their age, no longer perform in Europe. This autumn, we will turn Yoshito Ohno (80), Daisuke Yoshimoto (77) and Saga Kobayashi (72) into digital ghosts and let them dance in one of the most exciting new venues in Oslo - Oxertårnet. We get a unique access to this 11 floors concrete tower, before it is rented out to various artists. Our team will transform it into mystic space, blending performance, music, technology and culture together to allow the audience experience a vanishing dance.</p>

<p>We plan 2 evening performances open for everyone and 1 extra performance for high school students during the day. We have already completed our work with the dancers in Japan and we are now moving into the digital phase - editing and creating special effects in the hologram.

“Uno spettacolo che per molti aspetti ha lasciato tutti a bocca

“[…] parole e gesti che colpiscono la sensibilità degli spettatori e
vanno a stuzzicare le corde più vulnerabili del sentimento […] persino il
racconto della morte di Lennon sembra, grazie alla straordinaria
interpretazione di Stefano Skalkotos, la migliore fra le morti possibili.”
“La bravura del “rappresentante della società” di Stefano Skalkotos e

con una concretezza e forza tale da lasciare il pubblico letteralmente
sconvolto emotivamente.”
“Ancora una volta il teatro ha da insegnarci qualcosa che ha a che fare con
l’essenza spietata della Vita […]”Oggi ho deciso che questa bel testo uscito dalla penna di Eric Bogosian, dovesse divenire uno Spettacolo vero e proprio. Per fare questo si è rivelata preziosa la collaborazione del Maestro Roberto Negri, al quale ho affidato la Regia dello Spettacolo. Oltre a lui ho avuto la fortuna di incontrare e poter coinvolgere nel Progetto due giovani e talentuose professioniste che si occuperanno di scene e costumi .Ci incoraggia, inoltre, la notizia  che il nostro progetto ha ricevuto l'approvazione dello stesso Eric Bogosian, che tramite il suo Agente Mr.William Morris, ci ha concesso i diritti di rappresentazione in Italia.
Lo spirito con cui verrà affrontata questa nuova messa in scena, è tradotto perfettamente dalle parole di un grande attore internazionale Vernon Dobtcheff, che un giorno di qualche mese fa in risposta a dei complimenti per una sua bellissima interpretazione in un film, alla veneranda età di settant'anni, mi ha risposto: ""Cerchiamo sempre di migliorarci."".Saremo in scena in Prima Assoluta a Roma dal 18 al 23 Marzo al Teatro Tordinona di Via degli Aquasparta, 16.  Anticipatamente GRAZIE A TUTTI COLORO CHE DECIDERANNO DI SOSTENERCI.Stefano Skalkotos",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I started identifying as genderqueer and using they/them pronouns in 2018, the same year (and almost the same time) that I started studying clown. I was inspired by increasing visibility and acceptance of gender minorities, especially as I started seeing more and more content about non-binary identities online, and it really made me think. I remember watching one particular video by this amazing activist named Riley Dennis and just starting to sob uncontrollably because I realized, ‘oh, that’s me too’. So I started the process of coming out to people that week, which included throwing myself a non-binary birthday party!</p>
<p>My experience made me realize how important representation is for those who may feel like they don't fit in with the gender binary. As I started making more clown work, I realized that I was consistently making work that examined gender and expressed my own genderqueer and nonbinary identity. In 2019 I took part in an arts incubator, Undiscovered Countries, to help me turn my short clown pieces into a longer show and thus my solo show <i>Transhumance</i> was born.</p>
<p>I am now taking <i>Transhumance</i> on tour to Texas, New Zealand and Australia. While on tour I plan to do advocacy work and engage with Trans and Gender Non-Conforming (TGNC) communities. My goal is to open up the dialogue around non-binary gender identities while telling my personal story through clown.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about my genderqueer identity or the show, please feel free to get in touch!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> Why I'm Fundraising</h3>
<p>All of the funds that I'm raising through this campaign will go to the amazing queer and TGNC artists who are helping me make this show. My dramaturg, scenic designer and sound designer have all be an integral part of this process and I want to make sure that I can pay them a stipend that is not dependent on ticket proceeds. They will also get a percentage of the overall proceeds of the show - if there are any! There's no guarantee that I will make any money at all from this show, and I'm willing to take on that financial risk, but I don't want to have to make them take the risk with me.</p>

<h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
<p>No worries if you don't want to or can't contribute monetarily. If you could just 'Like' the Facebook page for the show (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/transhumanceshow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/transhumanceshow</a>) and invite your friends to, that would be an immense help!</p>

My play <i>Mourning Sun</i> received its world premiere with Theatre167 in New York November 2015.  Through my non-profit organization, Shaggae Song's Performing Arts Collective*, I am raising funds to bring Theatre 167’s production* of the play to the Kampala International Theatre Festival in Uganda.  </p><p>The play  is an epic cross cultural love story that gives a unique immigrant experience tackling taboo subjects. With a first act set in Ethiopia and the second in New York, this play follows main characters <i>Biftu </i>and <i>Abdi</i> as they navigate young love with the mental, emotional and spiritual effects of irreversible fistula. Why did I choose to write a play about fistula?</p><p>Several years ago my sister, who is now a medical doctor, volunteered at the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia. Hearing the devastating stories of the young women she encountered there, I realized any of one of those women could have easily been me,  if not for my mother and the resources we had to leave the country. This realization hit me hard and I wanted to tell their stories, bringing awareness to those of us here in the United States.</p><p>My larger goal in writing the piece was eventually to present the piece throughout countries in Africa affected by the obstetric fistula epidemic. It is a dream of mine to  present the play to women who are fistula survivors, for them to see their experiences acknowledged.  Equally fulfilling is the idea of presenting it as an educational, possible preventative measure for those surrounding them. As artists, we would be given the chance to allow our art to reflect our deep care for the womens' wellness and desire to eradicate this condition throughout the globe.</p><p>The play's participation in the Kampala International Theatre Festival, an annual event that gives a platform to connect the East African theatre-making community as well as  develop new audiences, would be the first step in connecting the imaginary world created in the play and the real life struggles and hope it reflects. </p><p>As stated above, the Kampala International Theatre Festival is covering some of our costs. They are providing housing accommodations, in country transportation, as well as giving the artists a small daily stipend.

My name is Antu Yacob, I'm an Ethiopian born, American raised actor and playwright. My play Mourning Sun received its world premiere with Theatre167 in New York November 2015.  Through my non-profit organization, Shaggae Song's Performing Arts Collective*, I am raising funds to bring Theatre 167’s production* of the play to the Kampala International Theatre Festival in Uganda.  The play  is an epic cross cultural love story that gives a unique immigrant experience tackling taboo subjects. With a first act set in Ethiopia and the second in New York, this play follows main characters Biftu and Abdi as they navigate young love with the mental, emotional and spiritual effects of irreversible fistula. Why did I choose to write a play about fistula?Several years ago my sister, who is now a medical doctor, volunteered at the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital in Ethiopia. Hearing the devastating stories of the young women she encountered there, I realized any of one of those women could have easily been me,  if not for my mother and the resources we had to leave the country. This realization hit me hard and I wanted to tell their stories, bringing awareness to those of us here in the United States.My larger goal in writing the piece was eventually to present the piece throughout countries in Africa affected by the obstetric fistula epidemic. It is a dream of mine to  present the play to women who are fistula survivors, for them to see their experiences acknowledged.  Equally fulfilling is the idea of presenting it as an educational, possible preventative measure for those surrounding them. As artists, we would be given the chance to allow our art to reflect our deep care for the womens' wellness and desire to eradicate this condition throughout the globe.The play's participation in the Kampala International Theatre Festival, an annual event that gives a platform to connect the East African theatre-making community as well as  develop new audiences, would be the first step in connecting the imaginary world created in the play and the real life struggles and hope it reflects. As stated above, the Kampala International Theatre Festival is covering some of our costs. They are providing housing accommodations, in country transportation, as well as giving the artists a small daily stipend. The Festival, however, cannot cover our airfare costs.  This is where we could really use your help! We are seeking to raise $12,000.00 with our campaign to pay for the round trip airfare from New York to Kampala, Uganda. Right now the average cost of a single round trip ticket is ranging $950.00-$1200.00.  We are also including cost of travel for the artists to get to the airport in New York. There are 7 actors (including myself, the playwright), our director, and our stage manager attending the festival.  The closer we get to travel dates, the more the amount is likely to increase, which is why we would really appreciate your help in securing these tickets as soon as possible.  Every donation made here to Shaggae's Song P.A.C.  is fully tax-deductible and will go directly towards the airfare and travel costs. Take a sec to check out the Attending Flight, Main Cabin, Co-Pilot and Air Force One perks you will receive for helping us achieve our goal!

<h3>From The Page To The Stage</h3>
<p>I began writing this particular piece while sitting contemplating life in a Botanical Garden in Edinburgh, Scotland. I am constantly in search of a quiet spot, a moment of peaceful reflection, or a tiny slice of silence, especially having lived and worked in New York for over 15 years. I became intrigued by the idea that peace and quiet could be a state of mind, something one could carry with them, boldly trudging forward in a chaotic world. But the fact of the matter is, that peace is fragile, delicately held and fiercely protected in a world where it often seems everyone around you is ""taking the piss"" as they say.  Even in one of the world's most beautiful cities, in a royal botanical garden surrounded by plants and flowers and trees from every corner of the globe, my peaceful contemplation was hijacked by inconsiderate park dwellers, lawn mowers, defecating birds and swarming insects. This short play is my attempt at exploring these ideas, and I'm thrilled to bring it to life!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Putting on a show requires money. In this case, I'm doing it on the cheap! Still, some costs are unavoidable, and necessary for the success of a production. Those costs include festival fees (which go towards theater rental, marketing etc), studio rentals for rehearsals, costumes for the actors, props which are essential for telling the story, and printing of programs. All funds received will be used towards those costs.</p>
<p>As an expression of gratitude for you contribution, I've come up with some fun perks to give out! Take a look to the right to see what goodies are up for grabs!</p>

<h3>What Is Join our Family, Make an IMPACT?</h3>
<p>For IMPACT 17, we wanted to tell stories for youth that are as diverse as their own experiences. We are thrilled to introduce our Theatre for Young Audiences and Family Pavilion programming, bringing multicultural performances and activities from across Canada that are appropriate for the whole family.</p>
<p>From Whitehorse, comes Gwaandak Theatre with <i>Map of the Land, Map of the Stars</i>, a show that weaves together untold story-beads from our northern land.</p>
<p>Calgary’s Making Treaty 7 and Quest Theatre bring us <i>We are All Treaty People</i>, and the companion shadow play for an even younger audience, <i>As Long as the Sun Shines</i>. This play promotes healing and inspires positive relationships across cultures and generations.</p>
<p>From Montréal comes Geordie Productions’ award-winning play, <i>Jabber</i>, a story about friendship, bullying, racism, and beliefs.</p>
<p>Locally, we have Shadow Puppet Theatre’s <i>The Flood Project</i>, which explores finding the truth behind an ancient story that has been changed, and perhaps also stolen.</p>
<p>We also bring <i>Stories to Build a Home</i> from MT Space's own Young Company, a group of youth, travellers, lovers, survivors, immigrants, and settlers, telling vibrant and joyful stories full of heart and rooted in ancestry.</p>
<p>In partnership with the Schneider Haus National Historic Site, we have established the IMPACT 17 Family Pavilion in order to bring theatre, storytelling, crafts, and music to people of all ages, where together we can exchange histories, experiences, and perspectives.</p>
<p>It is important for every child to see themselves and their stories reflected on stage. Art has the power to be validating and affirming, as well as to instill empathy and understanding in those experiencing it. We need your support to bring these important stories to the youth of Waterloo Region.

- The Watah School
My name is d'bi.young anitafrika and I am the Founder & Artistic Director of The Watah School: a w/holistic Black trans-disciplinary arts institute and professional theatre company located in Distillery Historic District. The Watah School cultivates and nurtures artists as healers, mentors, and keepers of the sacred using The Sorplusi Method. 


Previously anitafrika dub theatre founded in 2008, The Watah School was officially incorporated as a not-for-profit in 2014.  Arts-engagement sits at the core of our commitment to providing world people’s who are newly emerged, mid-career and established artists such as Black womben, racialized young adults, new immigrants, First Nations and LGBTQQIP2SAA people, with the tools to self-actualize, create urgent art and uncover crucial mentorship skills for each one us to teach one of us.
Our flagship training program, Performing Arts Training Intensive (PATI) is a one year professional development process offered to emerging Black and racialized artists (18-29 years old) who are under-represented in mainstream theatre and who are challenged to find spaces where they can receive professional development as theatre practitioners without racially and economically restrictive selection practices. PATI is a bridge into professional theatre that provides both theoretical and practical performance training while enabling mentorship between emerging and established artists.

The Impact
Through this model of consistent training and mentorship, our mission is to encourage young emerging artists to cultivate an intersectional w/holistic approach to their lives, their art and their communities; telling their stories, creating art and leading others, from a place of compassion and authenticity. Youth engaged in this cyclical mentorship framework, develop not only as artists but as community leaders and arts educators.



From it’s inception (in 2008 as anitafrika dub theatre) to present, The Watah School has facilitated the growth and development of over 500 artists locally, nationally and globally through residencies, workshops, courses, conferences, events and one-on-one mentorship. 90% of these artists today, are leaders in their own creative fields. 
Incredible artist-instigators such as Liza Paul, Bahia Watson, Amanda Parris, Jamilah Malika, Natasha Adiyana Morris, Kim Katrin Crosby, Lishai Peel, Randell Adjei, Anthony Gebrehiwot, Cassy Walker, Natalyn Tremblay and Che Kothari (to name a few) have all studied The Sorplusi Method with anitafrika dub theatre/The Watah School. Help us nurture the present generation of storytellers.

<h3>Who We Are &amp; What We're Doing</h3>
<p>My name is Sloan Thompson, and I am directing the Echo Collective's production of ""Kayak"" by Jordan Hall. ""Kayak"" is a play about climate change, about family, and about the lengths to which we will go in order to deny the truths that terrify us. In a world careening closer and closer to a climate catastrophe, I cannot think of any more important story to tell, and I believe that theatre is the form in which to tell it. Theatre gets us all in the same room, it makes us look each other in the eye, and unlike the screens that are constantly isolating us, theatre allows us to come together on the same emotional journey, not just with our fellow audience members but with the performers as well. </p>
<p>Theatre has the power to provide emotional context to hard facts, and to make those facts urgent and memorable. With this in mind, I intend to use this play as a platform to engage our audience in a meaningful discussion about climate change, and as a vehicle for inspiring theatre-goers to participate in environmental activism. To accomplish this, I have organized a talk back on our opening night, October 29th, where Jordan Hall, myself, and two representatives from Extinction Rebellion Vancouver will answer questions about the play, its themes, and local climate activism. Also, a representative from Extinction Rebellion will attend each show to provide information to any audience members who are inspired by the play and want to take action. My formula is simple: show the audience a powerful story, get them emotionally engaged, and channel that engagement into action. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this play as successful as possible, we are hoping to raise $1000. Here's where that money will go:</p>
<p>- Advertising! This project WILL NOT WORK if no one hears about our show! We will have 5 performances in our 60-seat theatre, so that means we can get 300 people talking about climate change and local environmental activism. Your donation will help fill every seat and have those conversations!</p>
<p>- Compensation for actors and designers! I have put together a team of talented, hard-working artists to tell this story, and they deserve to be fairly compensated for their time and work. As I am not working with an established theatre company to produce this show, your donations will go a long way in ensuring a fair wage for our team. </p>
<p>-Materials! Our fantastic set designer, Cecilia Vadala, has designed a beautiful set for us, but she needs money in order to build it. Your donation will help her design become a reality!</p>
<p>As a thank you for your donation, we have some perks to offer you! These perks include:</p>
<p>- A personalized thank you email from the cast and crew!</p>
<p> - A personalized thank you video!</p>
<p>- A video montage of clips from the performance! </p>

<h3><strong>Our History<br/></strong></h3>
<p>The Sebastopol Shakespeare Festival was established in 1993. In February of 2011, The Sonoma County Repertory Theater was forced to close its doors due to financial hardship.  A non-profit corporation, The Performing Artists Coalition for Theater, was formed with a central mission to continue to provide the city of Sebastopol and West Sonoma County with professional theatrical performance at the 104 N. Main Street location.  Since 1993, the festival in Ives Park had served Sebastopol and has been run by the company housed at 104 N. Main Street.  In the summer of 2011, as a brand new company, it was not possible for PACT to shoulder the responsibility of both keeping 104 N. Main Street open and running the festival in the park.  For the summer of 2011 then, the Napa Valley Shakespeare Festival produced two shows in Napa, and then brought them to Sebastopol so that the festival could continue.  As of the summer of 2012, the responsibility for overseeing the festival has fallen back on the shoulders of PACT.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As illustrated above, Sebastopol Shakespeare has emerged from the brink of collapse and built a new organizational structure, developed a committed board of directors and advisory board, recruited and employed skilled actors, creative personnel, and academic scholars, and raised its public profile to insure the organization’s growth. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Each season of the Sebastopol Shakespeare’s short life has seen remarkable growth over its previous season. Sebastopol Shakespeare is on a steady upward trajectory, growing both its audience and its financial base, and it is crucial that the company continue to challenge itself and its patrons. $7000 in support from you for its 2012 production of <em>Peaseblossom</em> will assist Sebastopol Shakespeare in its mission. </p>

Main Street location.  Since 1993, the festival in Ives Park had served Sebastopol and has been run by the company housed at 104 N. Main Street.  In the summer of 2011, as a brand new company, it was not possible for PACT to shoulder the responsibility of both keeping 104 N. Main Street open and running the festival in the park.  For the summer of 2011 then, the Napa Valley Shakespeare Festival produced two shows in Napa, and then brought them to Sebastopol so that the festival could continue.  As of the summer of 2012, the responsibility for overseeing the festival has fallen back on the shoulders of PACT.
 
As illustrated above, Sebastopol Shakespeare has emerged from the brink of collapse and built a new organizational structure, developed a committed board of directors and advisory board, recruited and employed skilled actors, creative personnel, and academic scholars, and raised its public profile to insure the organization’s growth. 
 

The Impact
Each season of the Sebastopol Shakespeare’s short life has seen remarkable growth over its previous season. Sebastopol Shakespeare is on a steady upward trajectory, growing both its audience and its financial base, and it is crucial that the company continue to challenge itself and its patrons. $7000 in support from you for its 2012 production of Peaseblossom will assist Sebastopol Shakespeare in its mission.

<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></b></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Catapult Love</b> is a high-wire musical-comedy adventure of a woman in search of herself crow-barring her way through a catastrophic line-up of lovers. It is a head-to-head onstage throw-down between the comedic genius of Katie Goodman, her co-writer Soren Kisiel, and the high-energy, addictive wit and music of Pulitzer Prize-winning political cartoonist Tom Toles and his riotous band, Lethal Bark.</b></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></b></b></p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Who The Hell Are <i>We</i>?</b><br/><p></p>
<p>Okay, half of you know Tom and half of
you know Katie &amp; Soren. And we’re betting there’s some overlap due to their
careers and senses of humor. And if not, there is about to be. Ya love Tom?
You’ll love Katie and Soren. If you enjoy the
liberal-climate-change-feminist-satirical-anti-Tea-Party mischief of one of these guys you’ll love the same artistic shenanigans of the other. This unexpected and hair-brained
collaboration between three of the country's most dexterous comedy writers,
along with performances by Katie Goodman (it’s a one-woman show, people), Tom
Toles (the band leader and lead singer)
and Lethal Bark (the on-stage band), is a project that so far is proving to be
unique, smart, energetic and hilarious. </p>
<p><br/><b>Why This Show Matters</b></p>
<p>We’re all looking for ourselves, and most of us are looking
for ourselves in the wrong places. Does that resonate with you? No, not at all?
(Maybe you should ask your friends before you answer that one…)</p>
<p><b><i>Catapult Love</i></b><b> traces the
adventures of a woman trying to locate her authentic self. </b>Katie has made a career out of writing from her authentic
voice (okay she writes with her husband, but let’s not start out such a nice
relationship with you guys undermining things with ironic commentary, okay??).
Her TED Talk (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=7oT1aAk06G0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_em...</a>)
and her book (<a href=""http://katiegoodman.com/katies-book"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://katiegoodman.com/katies-book</a>) both stress the importance
of finding ones voice. But what happens when you want to connect deeply with
others but don’t want to merge so much that you lose yourself in it? </p>
<p><i>Catapult Love</i>
helps us answer the question: “Who The Hell Am I??”  A stage aswarm
with come-to-life cartoon art, a rare happy collision of collaboration of
artists with comic talent in tubfulls, strange and unexpected new takes on
stage traditions, and a narrative as
dense with humor as stand-up comedy. </p>
<p>Help us breathe some fresh life and fire
onto the stage, and create a show of pure delight, surprise and adventure.</p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p><p><span>In order to free up our time from other
paying projects, so we can focus on the development of this one, we need to
raise moolah. This is really simple and straight-forward. We are seeking $9,000
which breaks down to $3k for each writer: Tom, Katie &amp; Soren. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What you are helping us achieve:</b></p>
<p>This is stage one-- development of the
script which is what is going to make something like this a success or not. No
whipping out quick-o first drafts! (Well, actually Tom already did that but it
was far from ""quick-o."" It was terrific. Wait, now that we think about it, he
didn’t actually show us his veeeery first draft…) So, we need this support and
time to really work through it and get it into shape ready for our first
reading where we will shop it around to theatre companies that will want to
jump on board and produce it.</p>
<p><b>The Impact of Your Donation</b></p>
<p>Seriously, if we can’t raise this we
can’t do it. Plain and simple. The days of writing in a coffee shop for the fun
of it are, unfortunately, over. Please, please don’t make us take that job
writing funny slogans for Victoria Secrets' spring sale instead of writing this
musical. Okay, that comes with some perks and Soren is across from me saying,
“Did they offer?!?!?” Writing a musical is a long, hard, concentrated project.
We can’t do it in our spare ten minutes a day. Because by the time we’d finish,
well… we’d be dead. And then who the hell is gonna perform this thing?</p>
<p><b>What Will You Get?</b></p>
<p><b>#1: PERKS:</b></p>

<p><br/><b>Okay A Little More Detail on the Plot of
Catapult Love:</b></p>
<p>The story follows a smart yet utterly lost single woman, as she launches
herself into relationships with all the power and inaccuracy of a catapult.
Mid-air she questions her aim, her destination, her sanity and her mother as
she chronicles it all for the audience with her lacerating narrative and loopy
artwork. Yes, like co-author Tom Toles, she is a cartoonist and illustrates her
stories and struggles with a dizzying constellation of caricatures, which come
to life in animation and full-size two-dimensional puppets, designed by Toles.
Her fatal flaw? Wanting everything to be one-dimensional. Life doesn't seem to
want to comply.</p>
<p>The music, quirky original up-tempo quasi-rock, chronicles in song the
cast of narcissists and losers that Lurid has the uncanny talent for
attracting...and latching onto. Looking for wisdom in all the wrong places, she
has asked the audience’s help in making a fateful decision, as she tries to
sort out what she is learning in the middle of the maelstrom.</p><p>(Note: support of this project does not bestow or imply investment in or ownership of the material or production.)</p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Wanna see what we’ve done that’s rocked

<p>Each of our projects began during our Master of Fine Arts in Performance/Creation at York University in September 2017.   As we embark on our first post-graduation adventure, we want to take our learnings and share them with the Toronto community.  Much of this work has been self funded but we reach out to you now to help us make this dream a reality.  Our main priority is paying all artists involved for their labour and contribution.  Your donations will almost entirely go towards real, working artists.  </p>
<p>Our work will span the complex conversations of queerness and race, capitalism and consumption, faith and fear, and beyond.  While much of the work tackles important and complicated issues, we take deep care to make our work as emotionally alive as they are intellectually dynamic.  </p>
<p>Your contribution will help situate new and experimental theatre work in Toronto by enterprising theatre artists.  It is these kinds of stimulating offers from you that contribute to a dynamic and alive Toronto theatre landscape.</p>

<p><strong>Mallory Fisher</strong> is a Toronto-based theatre creator, director, songwriter, and gin drinker from Newfoundland. She holds a BFA in Musical Theatre Performance from the Boston Conservatory. Her solo show, <i>MAD GIRL'S LOVE SONG</i>, is a three-dimensional poem derived from a combination of autobiographical sources and the life and writing of Sylvia Plath. <i>MAD GIRL'S LOVE SONG</i> is a reclamation of illegitimacy and a defence of girlishness. Set in an oven, one woman fights extinction while navigating questions about queerness, isolation, daughterhood, mediocrity, and food.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone. My name is Ian Knowles and I have been working professionally as a dancer since I was 17. I started early in television and clubs in Perth until I moved to Sydney to persue my career in Musical Theatre, Film, Television, clubs... Alongside my performance career I also started to choreograph - both small and large events. My last position was as Artistic Director of a pre-profesional at The Space Dance and Arts centre in Melbourne. Sadly this role was cut short by a terminal brain tumour diagnosis. I am happy to report that that I am still her 5 years down the track and ready to create.</p>
<p>This work was inspired by a street performer in Melbourne playing the piano accordion. Her playing was so beautiful that it transported me to Paris. From there other inspirations came into play; my love for the art work of Toulouse Lautrec, and my obersvations of cycles of life - and in this case cycles of abuse.</p>
<p>This workshop will give the creative team the opportunity to explore how the narrative will read and how the music will work to drive the story. The show is both beautiful and tragic but does offer some hope, and hopefully will inspire more conversation about this important topic.</p>
<p>The wonderful creatives are:</p>
<p>Choreography - Juliette Verne (<a href=""http://j-foxx.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://j-foxx.com.au</a>) Check out her amazing work</p>
<p>Musical Director - David Pritchard -Blunt (<a href=""http://www.davepb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.davepb.com</a>) The master of music</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of the money raised goes to paying all of the artists in the room; choreographer, musical director and the dancers. I am committed to always paying artists as they are so often asked to do this type of work for free. Because this is a passion project for me, I am taking no fee. I just want the show to begin to come to life.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal we will have to reduce the amount of days we can workshop not the amount people get paid. We are not working to a particular outcome, it is an exploratory process for both the team and the dance artists.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we have nothing to offer as a perk aside from a shout out on social media and the gratitude of all of us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only risks and challenges are raising the money we need. This process is so important to develop the story for maximum impact. The story is strong and the message is clear, now we need to give it life.</p>

<p><strong>Who Are we?</strong></p>
<p>From a small town nestled amongst the golden hills in the Southern part of Humboldt County, California, come an amazing group of highly talented and extremely excited women with an impressive vision! Combining bold entertainment with conscientious giving, we sing, dance, flirt and fundraise. With your generosity, we can continue to bring laughter, joy and inspiration to the many.</p>
<p>We are the Bada Bling! Burlesque. A troupe made up of fifteen unique and talented women who write, choreograph, dance and produce our own shows. Mixing the sultry and the sexy in with the comedy and the cabaret, we infuse our performances with variety. From hip-hop and jazz, to new world beats and burlesque classics, we perform in front of hundreds, bringing a professional show that has the crowd whooping and hollering, giggling and roused every time. Believing that all women deserve to shine, we offer an opportunity for ladies of many ages, shapes, styles and backgrounds to have their moment in the lime light .We believe we can uplift women to be the beautiful sexy gals that they are. </p>
<p><strong>What do we do?</strong></p>

So far we have raised funds for our local volunteer fire department, and our 430-acre community park as well as to raise funds to continue to protect an important and diverse primary rainforest in the mountains of Ecuador. In the works are shows to benefit our local historic town theatre.</p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help?</strong></p>

</h4>
<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">Mitch and Murray Productions is a new Vancouver theatre company with a mandate to present west coast premieres of plays from Canada and around the world.   Our focus is on intimate, gritty, realistic, character-driven comedy/drama with small casts, focusing on modern relationships as a reflection of the world at large.  Our mission is to stage these works in unconventional aesthetic ways, while attracting new audience members to the theatre.  <br/></span></h4>
<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">In 2009, the company staged the Vancouver premiere of Neil Labute's ""Fat Pig"" at Performance Works in Vancouver.  The play was nominated for three Jessie Richardson awards and it attracted several packed houses.</span></h4>
<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our next production is the Vancouver premiere of Michael Weller's ""Fifty Words"", Michael Weller's haunting new play detailing one night in the life of a married couple, alone for the first time in years as their son is at his first sleepover.  The play goes on an emotional roller coaster and never gets off for the full 90 minutes, examining every beautiful and ugly detail of a troubled marriage.  It will be directed by Jessie Award winner John Murphy and it features Vancouver actors Kirsten Robek and Aaron Craven.  The design team includes the brilliant Itai Erdal and Naomi Sider.  The play runs October 25th - November 5th at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre Culture Lab.</span></h4><div>We'll be staging the play in the intimate confines of The Culture Lab and our concept is hyper-realism.  That is, you as the audience will be walking into a set which is completely non-theatrical.  Every light, every bit of food cooking, every prop will be real and functioning.  As you watch the two characters descend into a most unexpected night, you will smell the cooking and literally be on top of the action as if you were a fly on the wall of the living room.  This is what theatre can do!</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h4 style="""">WHY WE NEED YOU:</h4>
<h4 style=""""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-weight: normal;"">The theatre scene in Vancouver has been devastated by public arts funding cuts, plain and simple.  As a young emerging theatre company, we are finding innovative ways to engage audiences and raise money privately. You, the individual, are both our audience member and our lifeblood, which is why we strive to produce work which appeals to audiences on a universal level while pushing the boundaries of what theatre can be as an entertainment experience.</span></h4>
<h4 style=""""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-weight: normal;"">When you see a play, you sit in a theatre with a relatively small group of people and you connect to something that you are very much involved in.  Your reactions - your laughter, your tears, your applause, they have the ability to change the dynamics of that particular performance.  No two performances are exactly the same, and as an audience member, you are part of an experience that is completely unique to that moment, that is vital and that is very much alive in front of your eyes.<br/></span></h4>
<h4 style=""""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77); font-weight: normal;"">When we buy ""limited edition"" clothing, wine, paraphernalia, etc, we feel a bit of an extra buzz as we feel we have purchased something rare or special.  When you invest in theatre, you are buying into something that is always limited edition, captured only by the eyes and the minds of that night's audience.</span></h4>
</div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><i><br/></i></span></div><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: 800;"">WHAT YOU GET OUT OF IT:</span></div>

</h4>
<h4><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">Funders on this site, staring at an investment of only $5, will automatically be entered in our monthly prize draws and will be listed as a patron on the site. You will have the opportunity to comment on our fundraising campaign as well as be involved in the goings on of our show through all of it's production phases, including a website blog and audience feedback page. Higher levels of contribution will receive mention in the playbill, discounted tickets, sponsor prize packages, dinner for two, wine and much more!  We have received amazing support from the business community in the form of in kind donations - all as an incentive for you to support our fundraising drive.</span></h4><div>Prizes include one night's stay at The Sakinaw Lake Lodge, dinners for two, free tickets to the show and much more!</div>
<h4>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">We will also be organizing a wide-ranging audience outreach campaign, including a contest associated with the production.  Because the play is, at its core, about love, we plan to do a play on words with our title and start a contest related to our production.  People will have the chance to email us and use ""fifty words"" or less to describe love.  Any form will be accepted - poetry, prose, stream of consciousness, personal anecdotes, etc.  The winner will win free tickets to the show as well as a prize package from our participating sponsors.  At the theatre itself, the lobby will be plastered with the best letters we receive from participants.  This is the type of creative marketing that we believe local theatre is in need of.</span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">!</span>

Our next production is the Vancouver premiere of Michael Weller's ""Fifty Words"", Michael Weller's haunting new play detailing one night in the life of a married couple, alone for the first time in years as their son is at his first sleepover.  The play goes on an emotional roller coaster and never gets off for the full 90 minutes, examining every beautiful and ugly detail of a troubled marriage.  It will be directed by Jessie Award winner John Murphy and it features Vancouver actors Kirsten Robek and Aaron Craven.  The design team includes the brilliant Itai Erdal and Naomi Sider.  The play runs October 25th - November 5th at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre Culture Lab.We'll be staging the play in the intimate confines of The Culture Lab and our concept is hyper-realism.  That is, you as the audience will be walking into a set which is completely non-theatrical.  Every light, every bit of food cooking, every prop will be real and functioning.  As you watch the two characters descend into a most unexpected night, you will smell the cooking and literally be on top of the action as if you were a fly on the wall of the living room.  This is what theatre can do!
WHY WE NEED YOU:
The theatre scene in Vancouver has been devastated by public arts funding cuts, plain and simple.  As a young emerging theatre company, we are finding innovative ways to engage audiences and raise money privately. You, the individual, are both our audience member and our lifeblood, which is why we strive to produce work which appeals to audiences on a universal level while pushing the boundaries of what theatre can be as an entertainment experience.
When you see a play, you sit in a theatre with a relatively small group of people and you connect to something that you are very much involved in.  Your reactions - your laughter, your tears, your applause, they have the ability to change the dynamics of that particular performance.  No two performances are exactly the same, and as an audience member, you are part of an experience that is completely unique to that moment, that is vital and that is very much alive in front of your eyes.
When we buy ""limited edition"" clothing, wine, paraphernalia, etc, we feel a bit of an extra buzz as we feel we have purchased something rare or special.  When you invest in theatre, you are buying into something that is always limited edition, captured only by the eyes and the minds of that night's audience.
WHAT YOU GET OUT OF IT:

For our upcoming production of ""Fifty Words"", our funding goal for individuals investing on this site is $3000.  We are purposeful in our use of the term ""investing"".  We are not asking for help for a charity.  We think of it as investing in a young, energetic company that will involve you not only as audience members but in other means of audience outreach.

Funders on this site, staring at an investment of only $5, will automatically be entered in our monthly prize draws and will be listed as a patron on the site. You will have the opportunity to comment on our fundraising campaign as well as be involved in the goings on of our show through all of it's production phases, including a website blog and audience feedback page. Higher levels of contribution will receive mention in the playbill, discounted tickets, sponsor prize packages, dinner for two, wine and much more!  We have received amazing support from the business community in the form of in kind donations - all as an incentive for you to support our fundraising drive.Prizes include one night's stay at The Sakinaw Lake Lodge, dinners for two, free tickets to the show and much more!

We will also be organizing a wide-ranging audience outreach campaign, including a contest associated with the production.  Because the play is, at its core, about love, we plan to do a play on words with our title and start a contest related to our production.  People will have the chance to email us and use ""fifty words"" or less to describe love.  Any form will be accepted - poetry, prose, stream of consciousness, personal anecdotes, etc.  The winner will win free tickets to the show as well as a prize package from our participating sponsors.  At the theatre itself, the lobby will be plastered with the best letters we receive from participants.  This is the type of creative marketing that we believe local theatre is in need of.!

Invest what you can, ultimately.  You might think of it as a drop in the bucket, but if we get a lot of drops, we'll have a bucket.  Your support will mean the world to our company as we look to gain a further foothold in the city's arts scene.
You can also invest anonymously on this site or by sending a cheque to:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Christina Giannelli, Founder of Dance Source Houston, began producing Weekend of Texas Contemporary Dance seventeen years ago in an effort to boost both the quality and profile of contemporary dance seen in Houston.  She created a platform to showcase 8-10 small to medium sized contemporary dance companies each year in front of a very broad and diverse audience.  Weekend of Texas Contemporary Dance takes place each September at Miller Outdoor Theatre, a world class outdoor venue dedicated to presenting quality performing arts performances in Houston. Every event at Miller Outdoor Theatre is FREE, thereby granting access to great art to those without the means to purchase a ticket.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In order to get a spot on the program for Weekend of Texas Contemporary Dance,  individual choreographers, dance artists and dance companies from anywhere in Texas must apply and submit a video of the work they want to see produced.  Dance Source Houston assembles a curatorial committee to review the applications and select a program that accurately represents the breadth and high caliber of contemporary dance in Texas.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This year, Dance Source Houston is happy to present the following companies for the 17th Annual Weekend of Texas Contemporary Dance on September 23rd and 24th.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span></h3>
</div><div>
<br/>Weekend of Texas Contemporary Dance makes an impact in both the dance community and general populations of Houston.  For the dance community, it is an opportunity to perform on a world class stage, in front of an audience that doesn't often attend contemporary dance.  And most importantly it is an opportunity for them to get paid.   <br/><br/>Most of the dance companies performing in Weekend of Texas Contemporary Dance rarely get a chance to dance on a stage of the quality of Miller Outdoor Theatre and rarely dance in front of such a large and diverse crowd.  It is an unfortunate fact as well, that dancers of small to medium size contemporary dance companies frequently do their job without getting paid.  Many are forced to work in other jobs, in other fields in order to support their time in the studio and on the stage.  Weekend of Texas Contemporary Dance is one of the few showcase events where the companies involved know they will be compensated for their work.  <br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Although all the events at Miller Outdoor Theatre are free to attend, they are not free to produce.  One of our biggest expenditures are the fees we pay to the artists and companies to perform and that is what we're asking for your help with.  <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Our goal is $3,000</span> which is close to half of what we need to cover the artist fees.  Every penny we raise through this campaign will go directly to paying the artists for their craft.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Weekend of Texas Contemporary Dance is the single biggest program that 
Dance Source Houston produces.  It represents a huge portion of our 
budget. We believe strongly in paying artists for their work and will pay all the companies/artists the full amount we have contracted with them.  However, not meeting our fundraising goal will mean using funds intended for other programs and activities essential to the Houston dance community.  This will place a great strain on our organization.  Your support will help ensure that the artists performing at Weekend of Texas Contemporary Dance are properly compensated and that the rest of Dance Source Houston's programming  will continue as planned. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Beyond our enduring gratitude and the warm fuzzies you'll feel for supporting dance, we've set up a few perks for you.  All the details can be found on the right.  <br/></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>As a group of Houston's High School for the Performing and Visual Arts juniors and seniors, we want to take on responsibility for creating our own theater to share with our community. Our beginnings as a production company originated this past August when, through solely student efforts, we produced <i>Rabbit Hole</i> by David Lindsay-Abaire. Always looking for more and more ways to express our style of art, we have decided to put on David Auburn's fantastic show<i> Proof. </i>We strive to give artistic opportunities that may not always be available to our age group, and to create entertaining and engaging theater for our community to enjoy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Proceeds of this campaign to support the production of <i>Proof</i> will allow us to afford more extensive scenery and costumes, as well as pay for the printing of posters and flyers and other forms of advertisement. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All profit from this show, once all of the fees from this production have been paid, will go towards the National MS Society and help fund their own efforts towards researching cures for multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $1500 dollars we hope to raise through this campaign would go towards making this production a reality. Expenses include a performance space, technical elements to add to the production, advertisement, and acquiring legal rights to the show.</p>

<p>Spread the word! Through our production we hope to plant the idea in people of all ages everywhere that they are able to make their own art, that their imagination is the limit.

<h3>About Fringe NYC</h3>
<p>It is one of the largest multi-arts festivals in North America.  More than 200 companies gather to perform in more than 20 theatres located in Downtown Manhattan. In other Fringe festivals, as long as the applicants pay their participation fee applicants are given an equal chance to perform by lottery. However in New York they employ the jury-based selection process and so the acts are selected based on their artistic qualities. Notable shows that premiered at the New York Fringe include “Urinetown” and in recent “Silence! The Musical!”, a parody musical of the movie”Silence of the Lambs” has been premiered in this festival and has been a long hit off Broadway. Every year more than 75000 people gather to the New York Fringe Festival. </p>

<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""> Dreaming to be someday performed in New York this    performance was first performed after 2week workshop in October 2011.We received many favorable reviews and so it was performed again as an official theatre performance in February 2012. We performed for 2 weeks which is a long-run for fringe theatres in Japan. In August 2012 we brushed up this performance and moved our theatre to Nakano the Pockets and made our revival performance. We have topped 2600 audience in total.</p>

<h3><strong>       The necessity of your support!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong><span>         (How You Can Help Us)</span></strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We have been requested by the NYC Fringe organization to perform our show “in Japanese with the Japanese cast”. Therefore we must invite the Japanese cast and staff to travel abroad to the United States. This production includes 5 cast members and 5 musicians including the composer.</p>
<p>For travel fee and accommodation fee for 10 people to stay in New York for 10 days,</p>
<p>we would need <strong>$20,000</strong> at the least.</p>
<p>We have been asking for support in Japan as well,</p>
<p>but we hope to raise<strong> $10,000</strong> here. We ask you for your generous support!</p>
<p><strong>________________________________________________________________</strong> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create a worldwide recognized musical and to raise the standard of Japanese theater industry. Compared to the United States and Europe, Japan has low standard of recognition and understanding for theatre culture. Rather than just importing foreign shows to Japan, we must start to export our shows to the world. Therefore despite all the possible risks, we have decided to take the offer and perform in this festival. We believe that this is a big chance for us and for other theatre creators in Japan. To support the chances for Japanese theatre creators and to be able to bring more Japanese born talent into the world, we ask for your generous support!</p>

About Fringe NYC
It is one of the largest multi-arts festivals in North America.  More than 200 companies gather to perform in more than 20 theatres located in Downtown Manhattan. In other Fringe festivals, as long as the applicants pay their participation fee applicants are given an equal chance to perform by lottery. However in New York they employ the jury-based selection process and so the acts are selected based on their artistic qualities. Notable shows that premiered at the New York Fringe include “Urinetown” and in recent “Silence! The Musical!”, a parody musical of the movie”Silence of the Lambs” has been premiered in this festival and has been a long hit off Broadway. Every year more than 75000 people gather to the New York Fringe Festival.

       About Count Down My Life
 Dreaming to be someday performed in New York this    performance was first performed after 2week workshop in October 2011.We received many favorable reviews and so it was performed again as an official theatre performance in February 2012. We performed for 2 weeks which is a long-run for fringe theatres in Japan. In August 2012 we brushed up this performance and moved our theatre to Nakano the Pockets and made our revival performance. We have topped 2600 audience in total.

       The necessity of your support!
         (How You Can Help Us)
 
 
We have been requested by the NYC Fringe organization to perform our show “in Japanese with the Japanese cast”. Therefore we must invite the Japanese cast and staff to travel abroad to the United States. This production includes 5 cast members and 5 musicians including the composer.
For travel fee and accommodation fee for 10 people to stay in New York for 10 days,
we would need $20,000 at the least.
We have been asking for support in Japan as well,
but we hope to raise $10,000 here. We ask you for your generous support!
________________________________________________________________ 
The Impact
Our goal is to create a worldwide recognized musical and to raise the standard of Japanese theater industry. Compared to the United States and Europe, Japan has low standard of recognition and understanding for theatre culture. Rather than just importing foreign shows to Japan, we must start to export our shows to the world. Therefore despite all the possible risks, we have decided to take the offer and perform in this festival. We believe that this is a big chance for us and for other theatre creators in Japan. To support the chances for Japanese theatre creators and to be able to bring more Japanese born talent into the world, we ask for your generous support!

THE PEOPLE BEHIND THIS
Do you remember the first time you fell head over heels for music?  Heather Jopling does. She was three years old. Listening to the concept album for Jesus Christ Superstar, she held the libretto and traced her fingers over the ink drawings of the cast, wondering which drawing was Ian Gillan.  She begged her parents to play the record over and over again.   Fast-Forward 40 years.  In the spring of 2011, Heather, a playwright for 2 decades, starts writing songs.  She writes one and then another and by July, she has completed the libretto for a vampire rock opera.  A... (wait for it) DRAMATIC vampire rock opera.  Yep, you read that right.  In a world of ironic genre send-ups and comic remakes of established films, she creates Mythos: The Crimson Chorus  -  an original dramatic vampire rock opera in two acts.  Problem is, she doesn’t have a composer who can put music to her libretto... yet.Enter composer David Velarde – the friend of a friend of a friend who is just crazy enough to say “Sure I’ll give it a go.” By Halloween of 2011,  he creates melodies for the entire show and sucks in (pardon the pun) more orchestrator friends of friends to flesh out the music. David Hoare, Jerry Steelfox, Jim Maresca, Martin Bejerano all contribute orchestrations to this project.   THE SHOWThe score runs the gamut: from traditional 1970s-inspired rock, to blues, dance, musical theatre and modern alternative-rock.   
Listen to sample demo tracks from our show in the gallery or on YouTube
The action takes place in an urban dance club, catering to the gothic set, in the sub-basements of a refurbished factory.  We are introduced to Aethan, a vampire. Through his selfish arrogance, he has been cursed to love and lose the same human for all eternity.  We watch as he struggles for salvation and to save the woman he loves. Abandoning camp, the plot is steeped in rich human emotion and drama: vengeance, love, hope, betrayal, redemption.  Mythos: The Crimson Chorus is told through music, recitative, movement and dance. The cast is comprised of 2 male rock tenors, 2 rock mezzo-sopranos, 1 rock soprano and a large chorus.   OUR GOALSWe have the show, now we need to get this sucker on its feet!  That’s where you can help.   Your donations will allow us to realize our dream: a creative development workshop and showcase performance of Mythos: The Crimson Chorus.  In August of 2012 we will be working with outside rock vocalists, session musicians, and a musical director to create a cohesive sound for our show in a week-long workshop in Toronto at Buddies In Bad Times Theatre.  Our workshop will culminate is a showcase performance of the production, on Saturday, August 25, @ 7:00pm.
WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES:Funds raised are for production costs of the workshop and the showcase performance. At this stage in our process we need to have outside input from other professional actor/singers, musicians and director types to create a show with true BITE.  
We're aiming to raise $8,500.00 here on Indiegogo to cover 75% of our total production budget.  Our budget includes:


Renting our audition venue 

Renting our workshop/showcase venue
Paying Collaborative Artists(musical director, musicians, actor/singers) 
Creating costumes for the showcase performance
Marketing (ads, fundraising, programs, posters, press releases)
Equipment rentals (mics, projectors etc.)
Find lodging for out-of-town collaborative artists
In the span of 9 short months, we have created a piece of theatre with engaging characters, global themes and great musical scope.  Working in our spare time, late into the night, we have come very far on our own.  We need a little more help to get this sucker ready to hit the big stage.  Please help make our vampire dream come true!",2.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>The Importance of Being Earnest features the handsome gentlemen John Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff, as they pursue the fair ladies Gwendolen Fairfax and Cecily Cardew.

This amorphous book musical, drawing on sea chanties and operetta, has been in gestation for many years. It's one of those crazy pet projects. And, not surprisingly, it's a project about pirates. More accurately, it's a project about our blatant cultural infatuation with piracy. We love the fighting, we love the fashion, we love the adventure, the lingo, the exotic locales, and, most of all, we love the fantasy of becoming pirates ourselves; the tantalizing prospect of shedding all moral, legal, and social obligations simply to bask in the freedom of the open seas.
 
We call the piece a fantasia in reaction to the slew of pirate oriented films and musicals that have attempted to stuff the concept of piracy into a traditional narrative arc – a choice we consider anathema to piracy’s inherent anarchy. Instead we want to trace three analogous stories in three different time periods – the Bahamas (1717), Hollywood (1943), and present day Manhattan and Somalia – music, text and movement chaotically interweaving in an epic poor-theatre experience that asks: is our romance with piracy – built upon a factual foundation of rape, pillage, rebellion and murder – a legitimate expression of our unquenchable thirst for freedom?
 
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU'LL GET
For the upcoing workshop, we are thrilled to have free rehearsal space and a brilliant crew of musicians and actors on board.

</p><h3><b>ABOUT THE SHOW:</b></h3>
<h4><b>INSPIRATION</b></h4>
<p>We all ride elevators. Some of us multiple times a day. And every time we get inside, trapped in the corner or squished next to the huge-summer-sweaty-guy, our bubble space invaded, and listening to the Muzak drone on we think, even if it is just a flash through our minds, we think, “Is this the time I’m going to get stuck?” And we scan the elevator to see who our fellow ragtag inmates will be. And we wonder if we might escape through the trapdoor in the ceiling. And we wonder if we have anything to eat because we missed breakfast. And we pray to God that we won’t have to pee. Or worse. And what about the overly pregnant woman by the buttons? Is she going to blow? </p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4>
<p>Going Up is a musical comedy that plays on our collective thoughts and fears; a musical that takes place entirely within a seven by seven space. Five New Yorkers on an average day in the city get into an elevator. There is an overweight animator who is going to pitch his newest idea for a cartoon about vampire kittens, a bicycle courier from the Middle-East with his bike and heavy package, an angsty teenager meeting her boyfriend for a sex-romp in her mother’s office, a hard-nosed pregnant business woman and a woman overcoming her fear of elevators. In mid-travel the elevator gets stuck between floors and they must deal with the troubles of being in cramped quarters including: stir-craziness, fatigue, hunger, bladder control and climaxing with an unplanned elevator birth.</p>
<p>
</p><h4><b>THEME</b></h4>
<p>Going Up explores the moment when strangers become friends, when differences are accepted, and all within a fun situation that everyone can recognize. Going Up is deliciously uncomfortable, amusingly awkward, with songs you will hum to yourself every time you get into an elevator much to the chagrin of your fellow riders.</p><h4>CREATIVE TEAM</h4><div>

<p>Then, why, you ask, are we asking for $3300? Fees. Up to 10%. Indiegogo (4%), plus paypal and credit card fees (3% ea.). In order for us to get the full $3000 we need to help pay our hardworking actors, we need to add the additional cost for the fees.</p>

<p>Vallejo Shakespeare in the Park is preparing for our sixth season! Once again our production will be directed by Clinton Vidal. Performances will be held at the Hanns Park Amphitheater in Vallejo July 25 and 26, at the Martinez Waterfront Amphitheater in Martinez, August 1 and 2, and the Peralta Hacienda Historical Park in Oakland on August 8 and 9, 2015. All performances at 3 pm.</p>
<p>Our 2015 show will be another “bare-bones” production, concentrating on the actors performances, with minimal set and modern dress. As is our tradition we will be announcing which show in April on Shakespeare's possible birthday. Drop us a line at vallejoshakespeare@gmail.com to be put on our email list and receive the announcement. <br/></p>
<p>Vallejo Shakespeare in the Park is proud to bring professional live theater to the residents of Vallejo, Martinez and Oakland. Our aim is to provide an inspiring and educational experience for our audience through intensive preparation and high quality performance.  </p>

<h4>Performance opportunities for the Bay Area theater community!</h4>
<p>One of our goals is to provide professional performance opportunities through non-traditional casting to Bay Area actors of color and varying backgrounds. Our casts are made up of multi-ethnic and diverse actors from around the Bay Area. Characters in the plays are often switched from male to female, as well as casting females to play male roles, providing more acting opportunities for women. Smaller roles are also given to novice actors to give opportunities to a wide range of actors at every level. We want our productions to reflect our diverse community where we perform and help our audience connect to classical theater with exciting contemporary staging.</p>
<p>We pay our stupendous actors a small stipend for their hard work and time, but we need help to do this. Please help. Thank you.</p>

</div></div>","Shakespeare for Everyone!
Vallejo Shakespeare in the Park uplifts and enriches the lives of local residents through a classical theater experience. We believe the arts are an important part of the fabric of a community and we want to do our part to ensure a thriving arts environment and help foster the value of the arts as a public good. 
Residents of all ages and economic backgrounds are invited to come together for free outdoor theater in Vallejo, Martinez and Oakland. We are passionate about creating, producing and presenting live theater, and introducing non-theater goers to the visceral, cathartic experience of watching a live performance in the company of other audience members. Because this is a free event, all funds to pay company members and operations must be raised through grants and other fund raising sources such as asking generous community members like you to contribute to this campaign. 




Your contribution will go directly to paying our fabulous and well deserving actors. 

Matinee performances, using natural light and sound, means we will not use or need lighting and sound equipment or techs, keeping our production costs low and our performance values high! Still, we need $3000 to cover our 20 actors' pay for our upcoming free performances. 
Then, why, you ask, are we asking for $3300? Fees. Up to 10%. Indiegogo (4%), plus paypal and credit card fees (3% ea.). In order for us to get the full $3000 we need to help pay our hardworking actors, we need to add the additional cost for the fees.






A free community event.
Vallejo Shakespeare in the Park is preparing for our sixth season! Once again our production will be directed by Clinton Vidal. Performances will be held at the Hanns Park Amphitheater in Vallejo July 25 and 26, at the Martinez Waterfront Amphitheater in Martinez, August 1 and 2, and the Peralta Hacienda Historical Park in Oakland on August 8 and 9, 2015. All performances at 3 pm.
Our 2015 show will be another “bare-bones” production, concentrating on the actors performances, with minimal set and modern dress. As is our tradition we will be announcing which show in April on Shakespeare's possible birthday. Drop us a line at vallejoshakespeare@gmail.com to be put on our email list and receive the announcement. 
Vallejo Shakespeare in the Park is proud to bring professional live theater to the residents of Vallejo, Martinez and Oakland. Our aim is to provide an inspiring and educational experience for our audience through intensive preparation and high quality performance.

STaG is the largest student theatre company in Scotland based in the University of Glasgow. We put on a variety of shows each year ranging from Shakespeare to new pieces written by our own members such as Styx. We have taken a new show to the Edinburgh fringe for the past eight years and we want to make sure we continue to bring new pieces of theatre to life on stage at the Edinburgh Fringe, with the murderously funny Styx. 




STYX:
Styx is a tragi-comic thriller about love and accidental murder. James Orphan musters his courage and ventures to the windswept and isolated village of Styx. His mission: to win back ex-girlfriend Eilidh and prove that he isn’t nearly as wet as everybody thinks. However, the weather is foul and he must first negotiate a fearful prophecy, cantankerous villagers and the malevolent plotting of disturbed local post-boy Eric Spinge. Can James accomplish his mission before tragedy strikes? Will disaster ruin any chance of love and a happy ending? Will the egg of fate be overcooked? Winner of the 2015 New Works Festival, Styx is not to be missed; expect thrilling grotesquery, whirlwinds of emotion and occasional bad puns in this tragi-comic tale of love and murderous intent.





What your money will go to:

Going to the fringe is not easy and costs quite a bit. When you donate you will be helping cover the cost of the venue, giving our cast and crew a place to live while in Edinburgh as well as the licence to allow us to perform at the fringe! Any amount of money you want to donate to the show will be greatly appreciated by all of the Styx crew.

By exploring an old story through the intersection of their artistic forms, we hope to discover a deeper understanding of this story of faith.WHERE?We will spend the month of July working and performing in 408A Colonels Row on Governors Island, a residency granted to us by the Trust for Governors Island.  The structure was originally established as housing for officers and their families in the 1870s. We invite our audience to meander, skip, and run through the grand architecture of this historic space as they join us in exploring an iconic story.WHY?Genesis 22 will hold open rehearsals every week and offer pay-what-you-can ticketing in order to create a theatrical environment that is participatory, challenging, and accessible to all.  By prioritizing stylistic, racial, and cultural diversity, we strive to subvert expectations and cast old narratives in a new light as we explore visceral honesty, ecstatic spirit, and communal empathy. The Woolgatherers always seek to make theater that shatters assumptions about the heights storytelling can reach. WHO?We are thrilled to have assembled a team consisting of both old friends and new collaborators! Part of The Woolgatherers' mission is to foster a community of like-minded artists in New York City who support, engage with, and inspire each other, no matter their approach, technique, or methodology. This team is a giant step towards establishing and growing that community.HOW?Art could never happen without the support and generosity of its audiences. This summer, we're exploring how to craft a big theatrical experience from a tiny budget. But we still need some funding for our minimal set, publicity, rehearsal space before our residency starts. We ask that you give within your means and garner yourself a little #ArtKarma along the way, or if you're unable to give financially, help us out by spreading the word on social media. And, of course, we hope to see you on Governors Island come July!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The Santa Barbara Ring Shout Project has been invited to participate in the historical first closeout of the Lorenzo Dow Turner's exhibit, July 23, 2011. The event will be held at the Smithsonian Institute's Anacostia Community Museum, Washington, D.C.     
 
Ring Shout was a dance-like form of religious worship done by African-American slaves, mostly before the Civil War.  It involves moving in a counterclockwise circle, call & response singing, clapping, stomping and beating on the floor rhythmically with a stick or broom.  Our blues, jazz, and rock & roll stem from Ring Shout.  Today Ring Shout is being revived into a cultural art form.  
 
Frances Moore of  will be one of the delegates to this event where they plan to create the largest Ring Shout circle in history by having all four of the U.S. Ring Shout performance groups in attendance.  There are three groups in  and one in .  The S.B. Shouters will be representing all of  in this celebration.  We look forward to becoming an item in the Guinness Book of World Records.  We are planning on leaving for  on July 19, 2011.
The Impact
Today, Ring Shout is being revived into a cultural art form.  The goal of the revival is to have a Ring Shout group in every state so that African Americans can celebrate and pass on to future generations this part of their rich heritage.
 
What We Need & What You Get
The Santa Barbara Ring Shout Project needs your financial assistance to provide transportation and hotel accommodations for ten local ring shout dancers from the ages of four to sixty seven to participate in this historical event in  from July 19th - July 25th.  
 
Our participation will enable us to learn all we can from the few remaining practitioners of Ring Shout, and the people who have studied and written about Ring Shout. We will learn to do Ring Shout in as authentic a manner as is possible. Upon our return to , we will continue a small performance troupe which will incorporate our new skills and demonstrate and share Ring Shout at local schools, churches, and special events.

For those who don't, our concept of training capoeira is much the same as anywhere else, but Mestre Beiçola's concept of life is based in vedic culture - helping  one another, being true to oneself, and being good to people. I can relate to that because that is basicaly what ""Aloha"" means.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This event is for no personal gain; I do not make any money what so ever. My goal is to provide an opportunity for the people of Toyama (the small country town I live in) to be exposed to the beauty of Brazilian culture and, at the same time, break the stereotype that Brazil is just soccer and scantily clad women dancing in the streets with fruit baskets on their heads. I am giving free workshops in capoeira, dança afro, and percussion, and ending the day with Toyama's first ""presentação da cultura Brazileira"" (presentation of Brazilian Culture), complete with Capoeira, Maculelê, Bossa Nova, Samba, and Batucada.</p>
<p>I have been teaching Capoeira in Toyama for 3 years. I have put on  many of my own shows with my students, but we just dont have the ""star power"" to pull off a show like this by ourselves.  That's why I need to bring in professionals whom I have been working with over the last 13 years to help make this an unforgettable event. In all honesty, I need much more than I am asking for in this campaign. (The entire event is going to cost, in Japanese Yen, the equivalent of 3,500 US dollars, but this campaign will help me raise $1000.) The International Association of Toyama is donating $1000 to us, and the remainder of the money I am trying to raise myself through numerous fundraisers, cook-outs  and bake sales. Sponsers are hard to come by, but that's not going to stop me from trying.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I said this will only cover a portion of the entire event but every little bit helps enormously. However, even if you are unable to donate money, please be a conduit and pass this on to someone who might be able to lend a hand in some way. Moral support is also greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>Help us to keep our theatre going!</h2>
<p>King's Town Players is a totally independent company that has always been privately funded...no grants! To enable us to stage the quality productions that we are known for takes far more money than you might probably imagine. Ticket sales and advertising only account for a portion of our income so we have to raise the rest by fund raising events and personal donations.</p>
<p>We need your help to keep our company going!</p>
<p>And, in exchange, we can offer you:</p>
<p>The satisfaction of helping to keep arts and artists in the Kingston community alive and kicking... oh and tons of tickets and other perks too!</p>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>King's Town Players was founded in 2010 with the belief that we love what we do and want to share that love of theatre with Kingston. In three short seasons we have produced fifteen plays, four beer dinners, one radio show and one 'found space' production. We have brought one original play to the stage and four Kingston premieres (with several more planned for this season). We have worked (played) together with several other local theatre groups, and we believe that working together is the best way to ensure our collective futures.</p>
<p>But something is missing... A Home. We want to develop a space where not only the King's Town Players can continue its growth, but a space where we can bring the Arts Community together. A place where ideas can be shared and developed.</p>
<p>We are currently working on finding that home. A spot that rehearsals, set building and Community projects can take place under one roof. Our current fundraising campaign will help us achieve this goal, but only with your support.</p>
<p>Please help if you can... spread the word.</p>
<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>We created the King's Town Players with the goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>To produce engaging theatrical presentations of the highest possible quality for our audience;</li>
<li>To entertain, inspire and enrich the cultural life of our community by providing rich theatre experiences;</li>
<li>To educate and nurture community members by providing hands-on 
learning experiences in various aspects of theatre arts for youth and 
adults;</li>
<li>To celebrate the creativity of those involved in theatre as actors, technical crew, playwrights, etc.; and</li>
<li>To join with other community theatres and artists for mutual assistance and enrichment.</li>
</ul>
<p>We feel strongly that theatre is a vital part of the cultural fabric 
of the community and that the practice of theatre can provide an outlet 
for creative community involvement.</p>
<p>Our promise to you is that King's Town Players will continue to work hard to present top quality arts programing. We will strive to be an inclusive group working with the whole of the arts community in Kingston.</p>
<p>The sky's the limit. Thank you.</p>

<h3>Save the Stage!</h3>
The Stage was built in 1903 as the Farman Theater and began showing films in 1911. Over the years, the theater has gone through several renovations and name changes. We are now a non-profit theater, unique in offering both film and live performances in our large 450+ person auditorium. Our mission is to provide quality, affordable entertainment to our community and the surrounding areas.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We depend on our income from first-run films to continue serving our community. Unfortunately, Hollywood is making the switch to digital distribution, meaning that 35mm films are much more difficult to obtain and our current projector will soon be obsolete. Without a new projector, we'll be forced to close our historic theater.</div>
<div>
<h3>How you can help:</h3>
<p>We need $15,000 for the down payment and installation of a new digital projector. We've already raised part of the money, but we need at least $8000 more before we can begin. Even the smallest donation can help us stay afloat.</p>
<p><br/>What will you get in return? Besides knowing that you've contributed to a great cause, your name will appear on our website with one of the perks below. If you prefer, we'll send you memorabilia from one of our many shows in place of tickets.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a donation of $25, you will receive 2 VIP passes, good for any show at The Stage.</li>
<li>At the $100 mark, you'll receive 2 VIP passes, and a beautiful <em>The Stage</em> t-shirt (black with our logo).</li>
<li>For a $500 donation, you will receive 2 season passes, two <em>The Stage</em> t-shirts, a signed poster from The Stage Players, and your name on the big screen! You can also elect to showcase your business or cause on the big screen for a whole year.</li>
<li>Pledge $2500 or more and you'll get a private screening or event at The Stage for up to 400 people! You will also receive two season passes, two <em>The Stage</em> t-shirts, a signed poster from The Stage Players, and your name will appear on the marquee and in our lobby as a contributor. You can also elect to showcase your business or cause on the big screen for a whole year.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, the funds gained will still go toward the projector upgrade and we will continue to raise funds throughout our community.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How your contribution helps:</h3>
We are the only year round theater in Wyoming County, New York and the contiguous areas of five surrounding counties. We offer a variety of entertainment options to our community, including first run and classic film, live theater, music performances (we've recently hosted Lone Star, Tracey Lawrence and Kendall Phillips), fundraisers, and children's activities and events.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Without the income from first run films, we can no longer afford our operating expenses and will be forced to close. Our community will no longer have access to local, quality entertainment, and Warsaw will have a large, empty building on Main Street. Your contribution can directly help the arts in a small town.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other ways you can help:</h3>
<p>How else can you help? We are always looking for volunteers! You can also share this campaign and spread the word to your friends and family. Even a quick post on Facebook might make the difference if we are able to make our goal or not!</p>

<p>Hi! I'm Kiva Hewett, professionally known as burlesque performer Sheila Starr Siani. I have been dancing since I was a little girl, specializing in the forms that are for and about being feminine and sensual. My students are moms, wifes, teachers, police officers, professionals all trying to stay in touch with their inner temptress. I teach everything from pole dance and striptease to hula and latin jazz. I also hold workshops on how to walk in high heels, lap dance and the art of flirting.</p>
<p>For the last 4 1/2 years, I have been teaching out of various studios, simply renting time and space. I have been for the most part managing one of them for a couple years now. All this experience under my belt has been great in learning ropes of how to run a space, but limits me in what I can do in the space.</p>
<p>Last year, I decided it was time for Velvet Circus to have a home so I can fully serve my students all that I have to offer in the realm of feminine arts and dance.</p>
<p>In order to start I need to secure the space, put in flooring, mirrors, poles (for the striptease and pole dance classes), ballet bars, get yoga mats, hook up sound, get some sort of signage and advertising.</p>
<p>I have found a space. It is double the size of the studio I have been managing with parking and enough space for students to wait inside (as opposed to out in the cold like they do now). In order to secure it, I only need $1200 more. I will be signing a 1-year lease.</p>
<p>Floors I have priced at about $2500. Mirrors at about $1000. Poles I would need four more (I have one) and they tend to run at about $350 each. The rest of the needs can wait. plus I have a little funding coming in.</p>
<p><br/>I want to open up March 1st. If I can get at least the floor and mirrors in, I can do a soft open. So I am offering a bunch of perks for people who are in the area and may want to take classes. The biggest being a who year of unlimited classes. For those of you not in the area or who are male, I have T-shirts and am working on a couple of other perks for you and will post those soon.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your support and even consideration. When i started teaching dance I didn't know how much I would love it. I really didn't expect that teaching dance would expand to include educating and empowering women in what we were built to be... Sexy! It is amazing.</p>

<div>We can guarantee that you have never seen anything like <b>Geryon</b> before! Our production is going to be site-specific, which means that we'll be performing somewhere besides a traditional theatre, specifically, at the Coach House (one of Evanston's beautiful, big, old buildings). Also, our actors will be using some unconventional performance techniques. Instead of a play filled entirely with simple dialogue and ""traditional"" blocking, they'll be using music, movement, and DANCING to interpret the story! </div>
<div>We cannot wait to show this amazing production to the world, but because we're an independent student group, we need to come up with all of our own funds... And that's where YOU can help us!</div>

<p>Literally any donation helps! Think of it this way, your contribution could become that cool mask that one actor wears, or maybe it will power the speakers through a dance sequence.

Hi! We are a group of student actors, designers, and directors at Northwestern University. But, together, we are the team of GERYON, a strange and exciting new play that's coming to Evanston this November!


The Impact
We can guarantee that you have never seen anything like Geryon before! Our production is going to be site-specific, which means that we'll be performing somewhere besides a traditional theatre, specifically, at the Coach House (one of Evanston's beautiful, big, old buildings). Also, our actors will be using some unconventional performance techniques.

We cannot wait to show this amazing production to the world, but because we're an independent student group, we need to come up with all of our own funds... And that's where YOU can help us!


What We Need & What You Get
So, our total budget is only $500. It's not much, and we are not wasting a single dollar! No matter what, the show must go on, but if we don't have enough money, then our production will not be at the quality we want it; our designers might not be able to provide necessary props, costumes, or set pieces. Oh no!

<h3>About the Play</h3>
<p class=""style22""><strong><em>ROEBLING: The Story of the Brooklyn Bridge</em></strong> brings to the stage the human drama surrounding the herculean construction effort to complete one of the most endearing and enduring engineering icons in the world. German immigrant John Roebling sets out to build the most ambitious engineering project of the Industrial Revolution—The Brooklyn Bridge. This would be the longest, tallest bridge in the world with new, innovative construcion techniques required for successful completion. But the effort is beset with setbacks and tragedies that leave the Roebling family and the bridge project in crisis.</p>
<p class=""style22"">After the sudden death of John Roebling and then the debilitating illness of his son Washington who took over as chief engineer, it becomes Emily Roebling, Washington’s young wife, who provides a surprising response and challenges all 19th century assumptions about the abilities and traditional roles of women.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Goal</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to have an New York City equity showcase production of ROEBLING in March 2013. This may be preceded by an additional production(s), readings and/or other promotional events to raise awareness and/or additional funds to facilitate production.</p>
<p>Funds raised from this IndieGoGo campaign will be directly used to facilitate this goal.</p>

<p>The NW New Works Festival brings together companies and individual artists from around the Northwest to premier original, short pieces to highlight the challenging, creative, and exceptional work being created in the NW.  It is an excellent opportunity for PWT to demonstrate our work, to increase our visibility in the regional theatre community, to come together with other artists, and to experiment with a story that has interested the company for over a year. </p>

<p><strong>PLAYLAB NYC IS BRINGING A <em>BLIZZARD TO</em> <br/> THE NEW YORK INTERNATIONAL FRINGE FESTIVAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blizzard '67</strong><span><br/></span>by Jon Steinhagen</p>
<p>Four carpooling businessmen are lost in the horrific 1967 Chicago blizzard. <span><br/></span>When they happen upon a stranded car, should they assist a stranger or protect themselves? Their decision is sure to haunt you long after you've left the theater.</p>
<p><strong>An award winning playwright </strong></p>
<p><span>Back home, Jon Steinhagen is a staple of the independent theater scene. He is known to Chicago theater goers as an actor, playwright, composer, and pianist.  He has</span> received four Jeff Awards, five Jeff Nominations, and six After Dark Awards for musical direction, writing or acting. He was a finalist for the first Noel Coward Award (2010) and winner of the Julie Harris Playwriting Award in 2009 for his comedy The Analytical Engine.  He received a producer-author initiative grant from NAMT in 2005 and received an After Dark Award for Best New Work for his musical The Teapot Scandals.</p>
<p>We are very lucky to have had a lot of history with Jon, and his work as a playwright is near and dear to us.  In 2009, we produced <em>Perfectly Natural</em>, four fables from a different perspective, and a reading of his musical <em>The Arresting Dilemma of Mr. K</em> at the TRU Voices New Musical Series under the direction of Gorilla Rep’s Christopher Carter Sanderson.  In 2010, we brought Jon’s unusual portrait of composer Erik Satie, <em>The Altoona Dada Society Presents: The Velvet Gentleman to FringeNYC</em>.  While earlier this year we had a reading of his torn from the headlines one-act play <em>Seventeen Heads at O'Hare.</em></p>
<p><strong>Blizzard's Beginning</strong></p>
<p>The Chicago Blizzard of 1967 struck on January 26, 1967 with a record-setting 23 inches of snow falling before the storm ended the next morning.  The snow storm stranded tens of thousands of people and left an estimated 50,000 automobiles abandoned on the city streets and expressways. </p>
<p>Playwright Jon Steinhagen used local papers, as well as friends and family for background for the play, “It wasn’t hard to get people talking about the storm at all. Everyone had a story, a memory, photographs.”</p>
<p><em>Blizzard '67 </em>centers on four men who share a carpool every day to and from work, not friends, but coworkers for a large corporation.  Trying to drive home during the horrific snow blizzard, the coworkers find themselves caught in the snow and lost. When they happen upon a stranded car, should they assist a stranger or protect themselves?</p>
<p>Steinhagen said, “Nothing else tests our humanity towards others or reveals our inhumanity quite like our response to natural disasters; likewise, when we do the right things for the wrong reasons (and vice versa), can we live with our choices?”</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help?</strong></p>
<p>A show that is as ambitious as this one takes a great deal of passion and resources.  We have a put together a fabulous team of designers and actors to bring this play to New York.  Your pledges will help us cover our festival fees and support production and marketing costs.  This includes things like: rehearsal space, costume pieces as well as compensating our crew and artistic staff for their tireless help during the production.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of our costs to help you see how your donation will assist us:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Actors/Artistic Team/Crew:  $2700</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Rehearsal Costs: $1000</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Production Costs: $400</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Office /Marketing Costs: $1300</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong>Total Costs:  $5400</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, we're looking to raise less than what it will cost to actually produce this show.  This is because we know it's hard.  Money is a delicate topic, and putting on a show is a hard sell, so we're trying to make it as easy as possible.  You can pledge a $1 or $100 toward our project!</p>

Blizzard '67by Jon Steinhagen
Four carpooling businessmen are lost in the horrific 1967 Chicago blizzard. When they happen upon a stranded car, should they assist a stranger or protect themselves? Their decision is sure to haunt you long after you've left the theater.
An award winning playwright 
Back home, Jon Steinhagen is a staple of the independent theater scene. He is known to Chicago theater goers as an actor, playwright, composer, and pianist.  He has received four Jeff Awards, five Jeff Nominations, and six After Dark Awards for musical direction, writing or acting. He was a finalist for the first Noel Coward Award (2010) and winner of the Julie Harris Playwriting Award in 2009 for his comedy The Analytical Engine.  He received a producer-author initiative grant from NAMT in 2005 and received an After Dark Award for Best New Work for his musical The Teapot Scandals.
We are very lucky to have had a lot of history with Jon, and his work as a playwright is near and dear to us.  In 2009, we produced Perfectly Natural, four fables from a different perspective, and a reading of his musical The Arresting Dilemma of Mr. K at the TRU Voices New Musical Series under the direction of Gorilla Rep’s Christopher Carter Sanderson.  In 2010, we brought Jon’s unusual portrait of composer Erik Satie, The Altoona Dada Society Presents: The Velvet Gentleman to FringeNYC.  While earlier this year we had a reading of his torn from the headlines one-act play Seventeen Heads at O'Hare.
Blizzard's Beginning
The Chicago Blizzard of 1967 struck on January 26, 1967 with a record-setting 23 inches of snow falling before the storm ended the next morning.  The snow storm stranded tens of thousands of people and left an estimated 50,000 automobiles abandoned on the city streets and expressways. 
Playwright Jon Steinhagen used local papers, as well as friends and family for background for the play, “It wasn’t hard to get people talking about the storm at all. Everyone had a story, a memory, photographs.”
Blizzard '67 centers on four men who share a carpool every day to and from work, not friends, but coworkers for a large corporation.  Trying to drive home during the horrific snow blizzard, the coworkers find themselves caught in the snow and lost. When they happen upon a stranded car, should they assist a stranger or protect themselves?
Steinhagen said, “Nothing else tests our humanity towards others or reveals our inhumanity quite like our response to natural disasters; likewise, when we do the right things for the wrong reasons (and vice versa), can we live with our choices?”
How You Can Help?
A show that is as ambitious as this one takes a great deal of passion and resources.  We have a put together a fabulous team of designers and actors to bring this play to New York.  Your pledges will help us cover our festival fees and support production and marketing costs.  This includes things like: rehearsal space, costume pieces as well as compensating our crew and artistic staff for their tireless help during the production.
Here is a breakdown of our costs to help you see how your donation will assist us:
Actors/Artistic Team/Crew:  $2700
Rehearsal Costs: $1000
Production Costs: $400
Office /Marketing Costs: $1300
Total Costs:  $5400
As you can see, we're looking to raise less than what it will cost to actually produce this show.  This is because we know it's hard.  Money is a delicate topic, and putting on a show is a hard sell, so we're trying to make it as easy as possible.  You can pledge a $1 or $100 toward our project!

<p>We are Open Heart Surgery a new and innovative theatre company and I am Coleen MacPherson the Artistic Director.   After leaving Paris having studied physical theatre for two years and writing, I have decided to launch into making work in London.  Open Heart Surgery came out of a desire to make original theatre that is both physical, poetic and also experimental in form and content.  I want to bring stories to audiences that are visceral and relevant, to invigorate debate and ignite the desire to share our lives with each other!  I want to tickle you and make you ponder while also opening your hearts to imagining this world in a new way.</p>
<p>The first play I wrote was <i>First Draft</i>, a play that stimulated debate in Toronto and won several awards, and a standing ovation at Hart House Theatre to a sold out crowd.  It was a happening of sorts, as it was something that happened and then disappeared but people then talked about it and wondered when it would happen again.  The play grew out of the team at the time and of course the incredible talent of now Film Director Sarah Warren, whose simplicity in direction and striving for authenticity is truly admirable.   </p>
<p>Sarah and I find ourselves in London now and we thought:  why not bring this play to London audiences, a newer version with the same spirit of experimentation and devising process of creation!  </p>
<p>And so this is what we did ... and this is why we need you!  But, before telling you what we are hoping your contribution can help with.  Let me tell you a little more about our play, it's evolution, and what we hope for the future.</p>
<p><b><i>First Draft</i></b> written by Coleen MacPherson is a play that explores a fast-paced world in contrast to a future world that exists in a protection unit far away from the Earth's surface.  Inspired by conversations on the street about war and EM Forster's The Machine Stops, <i>First Draft</i> brings you into a visceral world that speaks against the apathy of our time.<br/></p>
<p>The play invites its audiences into a very special world, an empty space where characters emerge and disappear and speak about a world that exists far into the future where everything has become deserted and empty, where a student yearns to see the sky again after so many years of darkness.  Directed by Sarah Warren and Performed by up and coming talented actors Charlotte Baseley and Louise Callaghan, the two grace the stage and flit between characters taking us through a whirlwind of people and places ... from a morning bicycle ride to a date in a jazz bar filled with the music of Miles Davis we hope to tickle our audiences while simultaneously riling them up.</p>

Cozzubbo, Assistant Artistic Director, Banff Centre for the Arts)</p>
<p>I am very excited for <i>First Draft</i>’s London Debut at CPT. This play
began out of questioning the necessity of war and has now grown through it’s
rework into a satirical play of many voices, jumping from present to future and
journeying through big questions like – can politicians be honest? Or is
war truly a means for peace?  As I
consistently watch in the media: a world of violence seems more and more the
status quo.  This play speaks against
this reality and tries to open our hearts and minds to another world and the
possibilities for peace.</p>

You Get to Keep Yours.</h3><p>As solo performer Mike Daisey recently said during a keynote address I attended, “The arts are in major trouble… This is the hardest time to be an artist.” I couldn’t agree more and as we all scramble to achieve our dreams, we are in a narrow chasm, trying to figure out how to survive. This funding will help keep me afloat while I continually build my career trajectory towards actual sustainability. I spend 40-50 hours week working to mainly build relationships with arts presenters who will hire me while playing exhausting festivals and smaller venues, including self-produced runs, that hardly cover my expenses.</p><p>Your contributions go directly to keeping <b>The Seth Lepore Project</b> afloat and covering a little over half of the monthly administrative costs which includes all the time I spend marketing and promoting my work, researching the best festivals to work with as well as the hours it takes to develop relationships with the media and arts presenters who are the gatekeepers to the industry.</p><p>This is what $10,000 will afford me:</p><p><i><b>A guarantee of $833.33 per month for 2014 that I don’t have to scramble for.</b></i></p><p>I know it’s simple math and you’re like, huh?

</ul>Thanks doesn’t cut it but it’ll have to do for now.<p></p></div>","This May Be a Flop. That’s O.K.My name is Seth Lepore. I’m a solo theater artist, provocateur and absurd humorist on the edge of shifting from emerging artist to mid-career performer. This actually means something to people in the field but the point of this project is to lay out the sorry state of affairs in the performing arts and the possible mortality of my chosen profession through Kickin’ Ass and Takin’ Names, a 12 hour live streaming web-a-thon fundraiser on December 7th from 10AM to 10PM EST!Originally meant as a scripted finalé to my trilogy on the underbelly of the self-help movement, I decided to open my creative process to the public as a mash-up workshop/ laboratory/ talk show/ performance experiment in order to find the essence of what will become an interactive touring piece. The audience will have a first hand account of what it’s like to create a show under an extreme amount of pressure, and insights into what is usually not seen until the final end product.The Show/ Fundraiser/ Documentary/ PR Stunt will deal directly (in real time) with the fact that this piece could be an utter and complete flop, blowout success or worse… neither. It will ultimately try to accomplish too much at once on purpose. I will embrace and simultaneously repel America’s fascination with social success and rubbernecking train-wrecks.My goal is to raise $10,000 in the half-day span. That very goal is in itself an examination of failure and/or success in the moment.Watch the live stream December 7th from 10 AM to 10 PM (EST) right here. Download the full schedule of topics and special guests.I Lose My Mind. You Get to Keep Yours.As solo performer Mike Daisey recently said during a keynote address I attended, “The arts are in major trouble… This is the hardest time to be an artist.” I couldn’t agree more and as we all scramble to achieve our dreams, we are in a narrow chasm, trying to figure out how to survive. This funding will help keep me afloat while I continually build my career trajectory towards actual sustainability. I spend 40-50 hours week working to mainly build relationships with arts presenters who will hire me while playing exhausting festivals and smaller venues, including self-produced runs, that hardly cover my expenses.Your contributions go directly to keeping The Seth Lepore Project afloat and covering a little over half of the monthly administrative costs which includes all the time I spend marketing and promoting my work, researching the best festivals to work with as well as the hours it takes to develop relationships with the media and arts presenters who are the gatekeepers to the industry.This is what $10,000 will afford me:A guarantee of $833.33 per month for 2014 that I don’t have to scramble for.I know it’s simple math and you’re like, huh? Let me explain. Over the last few years there have been four to five months during each year where I bring in zero dollars. I have times of year where I make a few thousand but I’ve never gone over $10,000 in the last five years in income because I spend so much on the expenses. Seems ridiculous? It is. $1600 is the minimum it really takes to just run the operation and sometimes that doesn't even happen so you're helping me get a little over half of that taken care of which is a big big deal.Check it. I’ve got some perks because people like perks, and perks get people excited, and we all like excitement.What happens if I don’t reach my goal?I have this set up as a flexible funding campaign so no matter how much I make during this 12 hour madness, I will still be able to use it towards my monthly nut. Your donations will go a long way because I’m an artist and know how to stretch money.I Am Nothing Without You.We could get all existential and say that I’m nothing regardless of you or not, but let’s face it: Without an audience, without people who have a stake in my work, who show up and participate in the experience, there is... No. Point. You, then, are everything.We’ve reached jaw-dropping statistics: the theater audience has grown -12% since 2008, the audience itself has dropped over 50% in the last decade. This whole campaign is an experiment in understanding the future of theater. Questions I’m positing:
Can I cut through the noise to get enough attention so people know about the web-a-thon, never mind actually watching it?

Can I demonstrate the strange notion of commodified theatrical “value” through the process of an end of the year fundraiser?


Can I show the full scope of possible actions in terms of failing and succeeding on a cultural level, as well as the process of personal past reflections and observations?

Lou was operating as a waist gunner on a B-24 Liberator when his plane was shot down during a bombing mission for Steyr, Austria.

</div></div>","A message from the Playwright..
Luft Gangster is a play based on the true story of my relative Louis Fowler. Lou was operating as a waist gunner on a B-24 Liberator when his plane was shot down during a bombing mission for Steyr, Austria. What ensued is truly a remarkable story and sure to live with you long after the performance ends. After meeting Lou for the first time in 2009 and learning about his incredible story, I decided I had to do something to share it with a larger audience. I have spent the last eight years crafting this play through readings and workshops, and have finally found the perfect theater for production in New York City. 
With just under 6% of World War II veterans still alive today, our greatest generation will soon be gone. These are the individuals I greatly admire. The brave souls who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and persevered to overcome the odds. Luft Gangster is my tribute to all those brave souls.
With Utmost Appreciation,
Lowell Byers

<h3>The Play</h3>
<p><i>Shatter the past, uncover the future. </i></p>
<p><i>Mirrors </i>by Azure D. Osborne-Lee was a 2018 winner of The Annual Parity Commission and will have a wold premiere run for 22 performances at Next Door @ New York Theatre Workshop February 29 through March 22, 2020.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573753424/bc5vpyj5qisaq0dzh82x.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our story begins in the fictional town of Etheridge, Mississippi in the summer of 1960 with Bird – a Black, queer woman (and the town pariah) who is mourning the death of her former love, Belle, and attempting to bond with Belle’s 17-year-old daughter, Alma Jean, who is now Bird's ward.</p>
<p>Though it began with an exploration of death rituals, <i>Mirrors</i> has become a work about the importance of love in the face of grief. And while it is funny and spiritual,  it also is an unsparing reminder as to what happens when a larger community deems someone “unacceptable.” Unfair judgments. Isolation. Violence. Discrimination and prejudice at all levels of society are far worse for LGBTQ+ Americans of color. (Still.)</p>
<p><i>Mirrors</i> is a personal story about death and life in the American South, but it’s also a poignant contribution to the ongoing conversation on social and racial justice, and about the love we find for ourselves and each other when we have the courage to look.</p>
<p>At its heart, <i>Mirrors</i> reminds us of the importance of family and community, and about letting go of the past in order to let in the present (and love).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Story </h3>
<p>Parity Productions' mission is to elevate the voices of women and trans and gender nonconforming (TGNC) artists in the cultural dialogue of theatre. </p>

<p>We produce compelling new plays that give voice to individuals who rebel against their marginalized place in society, and support artists’ work with two annual playwriting Commissions, with intense and dedicated play development, and by connecting and promoting artists with our advocacy programming.</p>
<p>With three productions under our belt, Parity is thrilled to be diving into <i>Mirrors</i> by Azure D. Osborne-Lee with a growing creative team, of which at least 80% will identify as women or TGNC artists. The play epitomizes our artistic mission, focusing on the experiences of often-ignored LGBTQ women of color, who refuse to change who they are no matter how forcefully society demands it. </p>
<p><i>Mirrors</i> was Azure's very first full-length play, and while it has received numerous staged readings and won multiple awards, Parity is thrilled to be able to give it its world premiere.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We’re Crowdfunding </h3>
<p>This play is Parity’s most ambitious production yet with a cast and creative team that is double the size of our past two productions, and some very special effects around The Mirror. (You’ll have to come to a performance to find out what happens.) </p>

<p>Our full budget is $82K+, but we’re raising $10K here to raise money towards stipends for our creative team (playwright, designers, director, choreographer, etc.). </p>
<p>If we reach our stretch goal of $15K we’ll be able to cover a portion of sets, props, and costumes! </p>
<p>Theatre (even Off-Off Broadway theatre) is expensive: just one week of theatre rental is over $3K. So, as a small but mighty company, we need all the help we can get. </p>
<p>As a company that advocates for theatre artists, we make it a priority to pay our artists fairly. Even if we don’t meet our full campaign goal, any money raised will go straight into the pockets of our our artists. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The ultimate impact of <i>Mirrors—</i>as with all of Parity’s productions—is to increase the visibility of women and TGNC artists both on and off stage, proving that their stories are as popular, impactful, and important as those that already make up a significant portion of the American Theatre lexicon. </p>
<p>Parity’s work is driven by the knowledge that, statistically, women and TGNC folx are less likely to stay in creative positions due to financial strain, pay inequity, and family responsibility. </p>
<p>This production is not only about bringing an exquisitely touching script, breathtakingly talented cast, and stunning theatrical design to the stage. It’s also about <strong>inclusion<i>. </i></strong>It’s about bringing this story to as many hearts as possible.  </p>

<p>Our producers have brought over two dozen plays to New York City over the last twenty years to audience and critical acclaim: the art is easy; the funding is the hard part. </p>

<h3>Here's Our Story</h3>
<p>Three years ago, a chance meeting of three theatre artists in New York spawned a dream.  A director from Italy, an actor from Colombia and an actress from Australia began an epic journey of cross-cultural collaboration. Our idea was to create a theatrical experience exploring the disparity between the rich and poor which would speak to a wide ranging audience. The result, Miss Julia, is a modern re-imagining of August Strindberg's Miss Julie, performed in English and Spanish. Our dream was to eventually perform in the Iberoamericano Festival in Bogotá. That came true in 2014. We have since traveled throughout Colombia, Spain and Italy and are so excited to be premiering in New York at La MaMa Theater.<br/><br/>This new bi-lingual adaptation by SITI Company's J.Ed Araiza brings together 7 artists from 4 different countries! Miss Julia is an international collaboration between renowned Colombian film and television actor Jhon Alex Toro, Australian theatre artist Tina Mitchell and Colombian actress Gina Jaimes. Music by US violinist Helen Yee and percussionist Martin Vejarano. Directed by Italian Stage Director Lorenzo Montanini.</p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>La MaMa presents Miss Julia</p>

<p>Set in Colombia on Midsummer Eve, Miss Julia and her servant Juan have an encounter that will change their lives forever. As Juan tries to rise from the depths of his servile life, Miss Julia wants to escape the bonds that tie her to a meaningless upper-class existence. The result is a power play of love, lust and a battle of the classes which becomes violent and seemingly out of control.</p>
<p>Performed in English and Spanish, Miss Julia is a clash of cultures, a dance of death combining heightened physicality and rich naturalistic text. This unique take on Strindberg's text makes Miss Julia as profound today as it was 100 years ago.</p>

<h3>About La MaMa</h3>
<p>La MaMa is dedicated to the artist and all aspects of the theatre. The organization has a worldwide reputation for producing daring performance works that defy form and transcend barriers of ethnic and cultural identity. Founded in 1961 by award-winning theatre pioneer Ellen Stewart, La MaMa has presented more than 5,000 productions by 150,000 artists from more than 70 nations. A recipient of more than 30 Obie Awards and dozens of Drama Desk, Bessie, and Villager Awards, La MaMa has helped launch the careers of countless artists, many of whom have made important contributions to American and international arts milieus.</p>
<p>La MaMa’s 55th season celebrates the creative and collective histories of La MaMa’s local and global communities. Since its beginning, La MaMa has forged creative partnerships with artists based in different parts of the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.  In recent years, these long-term relationships have taken on new life through distance collaborations over the Internet.  The 55th season embraces new pathways forged in performance and technology to connect the myriad experiences, politics, conflicts, aesthetics, intimacies and dreams of people and communities participating in an increasingly globalized world.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div><p>To make our dream of performing at La MaMa in New York a reality, we have to raise funds. International plane tickets, set construction and many other production costs. We have a number of exciting perks including unique photographs of our time in New York, personalized behind the scenes DVD's, a sunset sailing cruise on the Hudson river, unique Miss Julia t-shirts and personal concerts in your home. </p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is to promote cultural exchange between Colombia, the US, Australia and Italy by presenting a classic piece of drama that is accessible to both Spanish and English speakers and to those who are not regular theatre goers. Our goal is to reach as many diverse audiences as possible and New York marks our 8th season and 6th city to which we have toured. In today's political climate, the themes of class and gender disparity, inherent in the classic text continues to resonate with people from all walks of life and we believe that this important work will have a lasting impact.</p>
</div><div><p>Miss Julia was an ambitious undertaking from the outset. Creating high quality independent theatre is hard at the best of times, with international collaboration almost a pipe dream. We have worked tirelessly to make this project come to life and we are all greater artists and human beings as a result. A successful season at La MaMa will put us on the map as a company of artists committed to making high quality work that incorporates cultural exchange and help us leverage further performance opportunities here in the United States and across the world.</p></div><div>
<h3>Levels of Support</h3>
<p>All levels count - whether it's $10, $20, whatever. All contributions support our cause. We hope you’ll join our effort by donating, spreading the word, and coming to see us at the show in June. </p>

<p><i><b>SYNOPSIS: </b>Welcome to Independence, Iowa - the lifelong home of Evelyn Briggs, and generations' worth of familial misconnections. Evelyn's oldest daughter, Kess, a university professor, has long since decided to cut her family ties, but has come home at the sudden request of her sister; Jo, an incurable romantic, has become pregnant and is increasingly worried about Evelyn's mental health; while Sherry, salty-tongued and proudly amoral, wants only to finish high school so she can leave home for good. The sisters struggle to meet the expectations of their demanding mother, while the fight to pursue their individual aspirations for life and love test the bounds of family loyalty. INDEPENDENCE, by Lee Blessing, is a powerful, disturbing study of a family divided against itself.</i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact You'll Make</h3>
<p>We want to build a creative process that uplifts and showcases women in the industry, and your contribution will help to bring this exciting female-led project to NYC stages. <i>INDEPENDENCE</i> focuses on four unique women, their relationships with each other, and their individual struggles with independence, codependence, and interdependence.</p>
<p>Every dollar raised with this campaign will go directly to the show's expenses; primarily rehearsal and venue fees - and compensating all of our artists and crew members (something we're very passionate about)! Our total budget for this production sits at $11,000, so any dollar you can help us towards that goal would be so greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>As young female theatre-makers, we face a few challenges in bringing <i>INDEPENDENCE </i>to life:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Paying our artists. </strong>It has been a commitment of this project from Day 1 that we compensate every artist who is involved with the piece. We have an incredible group of (primarily women) actors, directors, stage managers, technicians, graphic artists, and more! Making sure we keep this commitment comes as a challenge for a low-budget showcase project like this one. You can help!</li>
<li>
<strong>Renting a theater. </strong>Finding a venue that suits our productions' needs and meets all Equity requirements costs money. That's the name of the game! Your contribution will help us raise the funds necessary to pay for the perfect theatre to bring this show to life. Our venue costs make up $5,000 of our budget.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rehearsal space. </strong>In order to bring this production to its fully-realized potential, we need to rehearse! And for that, we need to rent rehearsal space. While on a slightly smaller scale than the performance venue, this is still such a vital piece to the <i>INDEPENDENCE </i>puzzle.</li>

If our entire goal isn't obtained, we will purchase the rights of the play, and adopt a more minimalist set/props/costume concept. This will still allow us to perform, while challenging us to create a different vision with what we are given. Perks!There are different kinds of perks that you can get depending on how much you donate to our production; you can look over on the side of this page to see the details of those perks. Besides the perks that we can provide you, but all donations are written off as a tax deduction on your taxes! Not only can we give you perks, but our government does as well!The Ask:The Theatre and Performance program at SUNY Purchase provides $0 to their senior project performances, requiring the students to strategize methods to raise the money themselves. We are asking you to donate whatever you can to our project. Even a donation as small as $5 can make a huge difference in our production and performance. However if you can't donate, you can always share this page on Facebook, Twitter, or Email; or, you can follow our Instagram or Facebook !Thank You!Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about our project. We hope you can support us and can see our show March 1-3 in the Underground Theatre at SUNY Purchase.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns
