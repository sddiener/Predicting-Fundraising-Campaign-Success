<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Experimental Farm Network (EFN) is asking for your help to raise $132,000. These funds will enable us to build on our groundbreaking work, and in particular to launch an open-source online platform connecting an army of volunteer growers with plant breeders and other agricultural researchers. </p>
<p>Over the past two and a half years, we've amassed a large and diverse seed collection, developed our flagship farm into a hub for the network, and recruited hundreds of participants already collaborating on important projects. We consider this past work a successful test of our operational model and we look now to you to help us take our next major steps forward.</p>
<p>EFN's chief purpose is to accelerate the pace of innovation in agriculture. We're especially focused on the development of sustainable, carbon-sequestering alternatives to the destructive GMO-corn-&amp;-soy paradigm, which will be of critical importance in this era of accelerating climate change.</p>
<p>Enormous companies like Monsanto &amp; Cargill spend billions each year on agricultural research aimed at little more than corporate profits. We firmly believe that by tapping into our greatest resource—people power!—we can use your investment in this project to change the world for the better.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How EFN Works to Breed Better Plants</h3>
<div>
<b>Participatory Plant Breeding</b><br/>
</div> <p></p>
<p>The most important research we facilitate involves good old-fashioned plant breeding (quite distinct from unnatural genetic engineering). Without plant breeding, we would all still be hunter-gatherers. It is a science and an art that requires time, patience, and lots of repetitive work. Success or failure rests on an ability to recognize beneficial traits and rogue mutations, and the chances of success go up with every seed planted. The more seeds you plant, the more likely you'll find something new and useful.</p>
<p>Imagine an ingenious part-time plant breeder working to develop perennial eggplants, for instance. Her perennial eggplants would sequester carbon in the ground and prevent its release by avoiding annual tillage. One summer she might cross a tasty heirloom eggplant with a wild perennial eggplant relative and produce a few dozen fruits through her efforts. Each fruit contains hundreds of seeds. Her little experiment might easily yield 20,000 seeds. Unfortunately, she only has room in her small field for a hundred plants the next year, and even that amount would be challenging for her to plant, weed, evaluate, harvest, and taste-test.</p>
<p>Now imagine this plant breeder is part of a nationwide network of farmers and gardeners like the Experimental Farm Network. She can log on to a website and post her project. Volunteers can sign up to grow for her and she can vet them based on their profile (which would include a score based on past participation). If a volunteer grower has room for 10 plants, she might mail them 30 seeds, with instructions to plant out only the 10 strongest seedlings. A volunteer with space (and time) to grow 100 plants might be mailed 300 seeds, with similar instructions.</p>
<p>With just a couple dozen volunteers and a small investment in postage, her chances for success increase exponentially. She can see grown out in one year what would otherwise take her a lifetime to do herself. Maybe only one of those 20,000 seeds has just the combination of traits she needs—and by tapping into a network like the EFN, she can make sure she finds that one special seed. </p>

<p><strong>Building Community, Building Power</strong></p>
<p>This year, EFN recruited volunteer growers and experiment designers using an online form that plugged participants' information into a giant spreadsheet. Pilot projects included ""do nothing"" okra, perennial leek breeding, <i><a href=""https://www.cultivariable.com/catalog/oca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">oca</a></i> for the northern hemisphere, <a href=""http://civileats.com/2014/09/05/this-breeder-is-working-on-organic-ready-corn-that-blocks-gmo-contamination/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""organic ready"" corn</a>,  and improving <a href=""http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Crambe+tatarica"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tartarian bread plant</a>. EFN co-founders Dusty &amp; Nate spent weeks poring over the spreadsheet, then personally connecting researchers with volunteers by email and telephone. With the first funds raised by this campaign, we plan to build a social network into our website that makes it easy for participants to connect directly to each other.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our goal is to build a massive community of agricultural researchers and volunteers. We believe this is important not only for the development of new crops and growing systems, but for creating new organizational models and regional economies, and building power to counter the short-sighted profit-seeking corporations that have for too long dictated agricultural policy in this country. We need to create viable alternatives to the dominant forces in agriculture, and give farmers the confidence and support to make the switch. If we're ever going to have a climate-stabilizing agricultural system, we need to help farmers wean themselves from GMO-based monoculture—and we believe the best way to do this is through an interconnected community based on mutual aid and solidarity. That's the dream of EFN.</p>

<p><b>Preserving Genetic Diversity at Our Flagship Farm</b></p>
<p>At our flagship research farm in southern New Jersey, we produce seeds of rare varieties from around the world with a focus on little-known heirlooms, landraces, and crop wild relatives from communities threatened by war, climate change, industrial agriculture, and poverty. Our plants contain within them thousands of years of human history. If they were to disappear, it would mean the loss of precious genetic diversity that could help us both adapt to climate change and fight it. Many of our seeds were received from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Agricultural Research Service, which has been collecting plants from around the world for over a century. Only in recent years has their entire collection become searchable through an online database, which we believe makes this a moment in history ripe for unparalleled agricultural innovation (plant breeders from just a few decades ago would hardly be able to imagine this incredible resource), but only if we take full advantage of it.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, we've grown out over a thousand different accessions on a few acres—generously provided for us rent-free by a pair of like-minded family farmers—and in the process we've identified some potentially important crops that would otherwise still be languishing in seed banks. Some of our favorites include two perennial sorghum varieties from Zambia, two melons from the Maldives, a cucumber from Bhutan (see below), various perennial cabbage relatives, four frost-hardy jojoba accessions, and a perennial green-bean-equivalent from Turkey and Syria. We're excited to be growing these plants not simply for what they might hold for the future, but for their links to the past. We are eager to return seeds to the communities from which they originated in as many cases as possible (we're already working to return sorghum varieties from South Sudan to the war-torn communities from which they were collected by scientists many decades ago). </p>
<p>We know there are untold treasures in the USDA's seed banks and in similar institutions throughout the world. We need to develop the capacity among ordinary citizens to engage with these institutions, support their work, and bring valuable lost seeds back from obscurity and into circulation. The agricultural heritage of humanity cannot be preserved in seed banks alone: it must be nurtured, preserved, and improved upon through use. This is a generational task, and none of us can do it alone.</p>

Introduction
EFN aims to fight global climate change by breeding new crop plants and developing improved growing systems with a focus on carbon sequestration and mitigating the effects of climate change. We plan to do this the only way we know how: through facilitating widespread collaboration and cooperation.
The climate crisis threatens life as we know it on this planet. It has already contributed to instability and natural disasters around the world, from Syria and Sudan to New Orleans and New York/New Jersey. While no single solution is big enough to solve this problem, fixing our broken agriculture system would be a huge start. We envision an agriculture that relies on carbon-sequestering perennial plants and organic, agroecological, and permaculture-based systems, as opposed to the energy-intensive, chemical and GMO-based industrial systems that currently dominate farming.
You can read more about climate-stabilizing agriculture on our website.
Founded in 2013 by young farmer/activists Nate Kleinman and Dusty Hinz, EFN is a 501(c)3 non-profit cooperative incorporated in Pennsylvania as The Experimental Farm Network Cooperative. From our home base in the Philadelphia area, including our flagship farm in Elmer, New Jersey, we're building a grassroots army of plant breeders, researchers, and volunteers. For 2015, our pilot year in wide operation, we recruited participants from 44 US states, 4 Canadian provinces, and 15 countries. 


EFN's work with Syrian seeds was covered by The Guardian, Nov. 2015.


Among our successes thus far: we've introduced new crop varieties to American growers (like the Nerum Boer popping sorghum from South Sudan) and saved others from obscurity or extinction (like the 'Tracy' mayapple from Pennsylvania); we've gathered together a world-class Board of Directors, including two living legends, Dr. Vandana Shiva and Dr. William Woys Weaver; and our work has been featured in The Philadelphia Daily News, The Organic Broadcaster, and The Guardian.
Yet despite these successes, we still have a long way to go. If we're to achieve our ambitious goal—crowdsourcing a climate-stabilizing agricultural system—we'll need to expand the network exponentially.
We can't rely on corporations or governments to do this work. We can only rely on ourselves. If we come together on an unprecedented scale, there's no telling what we can achieve.

    How EFN Works to Breed Better Plants

Participatory Plant Breeding
 
The most important research we facilitate involves good old-fashioned plant breeding (quite distinct from unnatural genetic engineering). Without plant breeding, we would all still be hunter-gatherers. It is a science and an art that requires time, patience, and lots of repetitive work. Success or failure rests on an ability to recognize beneficial traits and rogue mutations, and the chances of success go up with every seed planted. The more seeds you plant, the more likely you'll find something new and useful.
Imagine an ingenious part-time plant breeder working to develop perennial eggplants, for instance. Her perennial eggplants would sequester carbon in the ground and prevent its release by avoiding annual tillage. One summer she might cross a tasty heirloom eggplant with a wild perennial eggplant relative and produce a few dozen fruits through her efforts. Each fruit contains hundreds of seeds. Her little experiment might easily yield 20,000 seeds. Unfortunately, she only has room in her small field for a hundred plants the next year, and even that amount would be challenging for her to plant, weed, evaluate, harvest, and taste-test.
Now imagine this plant breeder is part of a nationwide network of farmers and gardeners like the Experimental Farm Network. She can log on to a website and post her project. Volunteers can sign up to grow for her and she can vet them based on their profile (which would include a score based on past participation). If a volunteer grower has room for 10 plants, she might mail them 30 seeds, with instructions to plant out only the 10 strongest seedlings. A volunteer with space (and time) to grow 100 plants might be mailed 300 seeds, with similar instructions.
With just a couple dozen volunteers and a small investment in postage, her chances for success increase exponentially. She can see grown out in one year what would otherwise take her a lifetime to do herself. Maybe only one of those 20,000 seeds has just the combination of traits she needs—and by tapping into a network like the EFN, she can make sure she finds that one special seed.

Building Community, Building Power
This year, EFN recruited volunteer growers and experiment designers using an online form that plugged participants' information into a giant spreadsheet. Pilot projects included ""do nothing"" okra, perennial leek breeding, oca for the northern hemisphere, ""organic ready"" corn,  and improving Tartarian bread plant. EFN co-founders Dusty & Nate spent weeks poring over the spreadsheet, then personally connecting researchers with volunteers by email and telephone. With the first funds raised by this campaign, we plan to build a social network into our website that makes it easy for participants to connect directly to each other.
Ultimately, our goal is to build a massive community of agricultural researchers and volunteers. We believe this is important not only for the development of new crops and growing systems, but for creating new organizational models and regional economies, and building power to counter the short-sighted profit-seeking corporations that have for too long dictated agricultural policy in this country. We need to create viable alternatives to the dominant forces in agriculture, and give farmers the confidence and support to make the switch. If we're ever going to have a climate-stabilizing agricultural system, we need to help farmers wean themselves from GMO-based monoculture—and we believe the best way to do this is through an interconnected community based on mutual aid and solidarity. That's the dream of EFN.

In particular, we plan to initiate a pilot regional cooperative in southern New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania to produce and sell rare seeds, plants, and a few select food products. The proceeds from these sales will support the ongoing work of further growing and maintaining the EFN. Your donations now will allow us to achieve self-sufficiency far into the future.Our budget includes (in order of priority):1. EFN's online network development - $5,0002. Improved seed storage facilities & refridgeration - $4,000 3. Seed packaging & shipping supplies - $3,5004. Greenhouse with winter heating capability - $6,5005. Small grain mill - $8006. Oilseed press - $7007. Sorghum cane press & evaporator - $2,5008. Walk-behind tractor & attachments - $5,000 9. Two full-time staff positions for two years - $80,00010. Part-time seasonal labor (at $15/hr) - $14,00011. Solar-powered irrigation system expansion - $2,00012. Miscellaneous supplies & travel expenses - $8,000TOTAL: $132,000A tunnel protects rare heirloom sweet potatoes from groundhogs at the EFN flagship farm in Elmer, NJ, as our solar-powered irrigation system feeds pond-water to various seeds in June 2015.We Promise:
To work every day to see the Experimental Farm Network reach its full potential. 
To maintain our focus on sustainability, climate change mitigation, and climate stabilization. 
To spend your money wisely and report back to you with all of our successes and failures. 
To continue working cooperatively and transparently at every turn. 
To keep fighting for better agriculture policy in the United States.
To stay committed to social, racial, and economic justice. 

To make a difference.

a nutshell, a PV-diesel-battery microgrid makes usable energy from the sun, and
it can be directly used by loads, and stored by batteries for later use. If
there is not enough energy being produced by the PV array due to cloud cover,

<p>The <b>NE MN Women of the ELCA</b> (Evangelical Lutheran Church of
America) mobilize women to act boldly on their faith in Jesus Christ. The Women
of the ELCA traveled to be inspired by the bold women of Liberia who played a
significant role in ending the civil war there, and they indeed got inspired.
During their stay in Liberia, they visited Phebe Hospital, and asked Medical
Director Dr. Sibley what his biggest challenge was. Expecting disease, or some
other issue to be the biggest difficulty, they were shocked when he responded,
“power.” With bountiful sunshine as a resource, Dr. Sibley and the Women of the
ELCA resolved that solar power could bring relief to Phebe’s health care
infrastructure. And the Women of the ELCA determined to do something about it.
The NE MN Women of the ELCA pledged to raise $200,000 for the project. </p>

<p>The area of the world we know today as Liberia was founded and controlled by former African American slaves.  Liberia declared independence in 1847.  The country continued to be in the American sphere of influence, and became dominated by the small minority of black colonists and their descendants.  Ultimately, this continued domination by a few and suppression of the majority helped lead to the protracted civil war which significantly contributed to unrest leading to a coup d'etat in 1980.</p>
<p>The women in Liberia organized, including all religious groups and classes, and throughout 2002-3 successfully forced the warring factions to make peace, without any weapons beyond their force of will. Two Liberian women won Nobel Peace prizes as a result of their incredible efforts, the current President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and Leymah Gbowee.</p>
<p>The area where Phebe Hospital is located was one of the strongholds for some of the fighting groups, and Phebe had to evacuate on numerous occasions due to the chaos taking place around them. The dedicated staff evacuated to a safer area, and reopened there, returning to the hospital grounds when the situation calmed, refusing to close operations throughout the entire civil war.

</div>","Phebe Hospital in Liberia spends $35,000 every month on diesel fuel to run its generators and provide essential electricity for its operations. For the first hospital in Liberia that faced a patient with Ebola, this is incredibly expensive, unsustainable, and unreliable.
Our Goal of $35,000 = one months' diesel fuel bill at Phebe Hospital




 


""Many
times, so many times Dr. Sibley has gone into the operating room in darkness
because there is no power. Sometimes the generators are down, sometimes the
diesel has not arrived yet."" -Josephine Kantan, Head of Generator Operations
at Phebe Hospital

Phebe Hospital and School of Nursing used to be part of Liberia’s central electric grid infrastructure. The hospital used to be one of the most advanced in the country.  Then the bloody and destructive civil war started, and subsequently destroyed much of the infrastructure in Liberia, which including the dismantling of central power grid. The war ended in 2003, but Liberia has struggled to rebuild, with still only about 1% of Liberians having access to the electric grid in Monrovia.



""Sometimes
especially in the rainy season, the roads get so bad that the trucks bringing
the diesel get stuck in the mud for days. Since they are unable to reach us, we
are working in the darkness. Hospitals need electricity to operate, so if we
had access to solar energy that would be a lifesaver."" -Dr. Sibley,
Medical Director


Phebe Hospital serves a population of 450,000
in rural Liberia, seeing over 30,000 patients every year. They spend $35,000
every month on diesel fuel to run their generators. It would take the average
Liberian 77 years to earn enough money to pay for one months' worth of Phebe
Hospital's power bills!                                                       


                         

                  
Delivery expenses of diesel fuel add to the already high cost, while the environmental costs are not only limited to what comes out of the smoke stack, but what leaks onto the ground.
The Ground around the
generator building is saturated with diesel fuel.

                  
                       
Opportunities
for a new model of development are created where there is a lack of central
electric grid. Just as many countries in Africa have skipped the telephone landline
infrastructure and gone straight to cell phone communication, rural communities
have the opportunity to Skip the electric Grid. Local communities can take
control of their energy future by generating their own renewable power, right
where it is consumed.
We
can change the situation for Phebe! We will empower Phebe Hospital and School
of Nursing, Liberia, West Africa with solar energy.
Help
us provide Phebe with access to reliable zero emissions renewable energy to
save lives and make the planet a little more green.

In
a nutshell, a PV-diesel-battery microgrid makes usable energy from the sun, and
it can be directly used by loads, and stored by batteries for later use. If
there is not enough energy being produced by the PV array due to cloud cover,
then the system will turn on a back-up generator. 


PV for Phebe is a project of RREAL, the Rural
Renewable Energy Alliance, and our partners. RREAL was founded in 2000, to
solve fuel poverty with solar energy, balancing the use of advanced technology
with the interests of our environment while bringing lasting independence,
economic and social change to communities. RREAL is a 501(c)(3), tax-exempt
nonprofit organization that has been delivering solar energy to low-income individuals
and communities since our inception.
                         
Our staff electricians, contractors, technicians and engineers have over
50 years’ experience specifically in solar project management and development,
and have NABCEP (North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners)
certification.

We tackle social, economic, and environmental
justice issues with solar power. We believe that solar energy can be used as a
vehicle to address poverty in America and on the rest of the planet. Solar
is a powerful and empowering solution!

Phebe
Hospital is like a miniature city, with masons,
electricians, cabinet builders, and more. Phebe will do site preparation work
prior to the arrival of equipment and the RREAL team, including construction of
the balance of system facility. Phebe’s electricians will complete the system
installation, and operations and maintenance training with RREAL’s team. Phebe electricians
already have experience in completing off-grid solar electric installations on
rural health clinics affiliated with Phebe, so they come with valuable
experience. Phebe will further supply room and board while the RREAL
installation and training team is on the ground.




The NE MN Women of the ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church of
America) mobilize women to act boldly on their faith in Jesus Christ. The Women
of the ELCA traveled to be inspired by the bold women of Liberia who played a
significant role in ending the civil war there, and they indeed got inspired.
During their stay in Liberia, they visited Phebe Hospital, and asked Medical
Director Dr. Sibley what his biggest challenge was. Expecting disease, or some
other issue to be the biggest difficulty, they were shocked when he responded,
“power.” With bountiful sunshine as a resource, Dr. Sibley and the Women of the
ELCA resolved that solar power could bring relief to Phebe’s health care
infrastructure. And the Women of the ELCA determined to do something about it.
The NE MN Women of the ELCA pledged to raise $200,000 for the project. 
Global
Health Ministries has a vision to change the world through building
partnerships that result in thriving community health systems that are
measurably stronger, more effective and sustainable. With their considerable
experience in international logistics and years of sending shipments to
Liberia, including solar systems, they will help ensure products arrive safely
and in a timely fashion to Liberia. Global Health Ministries regularly sends
shipments of medical and other supplies to Phebe Hospital and supports many
other clinics and hospitals around the globe.
University of St Thomas’ Dr. Greg Mowry, Director
of the Renewable Energy and Alternatives Laboratory, is experienced in
designing renewable energy microgrids, with completed projects at the
University of Moldova, for a 150-bed hospital in Tanzania, rural villages in
Uganda, as well as microgrid projects in the United States. Dr. Mowry’s power
engineering team provides technical assistance. 


                                                    
 The Lutheran Church in Liberia owns the land at Phebe Hospital.  The equipment shipped will be consigned to the Lutheran Church in Liberia and as such will not be subject to duties and tariffs.  Liberian Customs consistently treats shipments with courtesy and expedites the process.

                             

We’ve developed a proven way of reducing
energy poverty. We need your help to buy, ship, and assemble the photovoltaic
systems at the Phebe Hospital. The Women of ELCA have adopted a resolution to
support this project, but we still do not have enough money to afford the
equipment necessary for this project.


     
      
  
The area of the world we know today as Liberia was founded and controlled by former African American slaves.  Liberia declared independence in 1847.  The country continued to be in the American sphere of influence, and became dominated by the small minority of black colonists and their descendants.  Ultimately, this continued domination by a few and suppression of the majority helped lead to the protracted civil war which significantly contributed to unrest leading to a coup d'etat in 1980.
The women in Liberia organized, including all religious groups and classes, and throughout 2002-3 successfully forced the warring factions to make peace, without any weapons beyond their force of will. Two Liberian women won Nobel Peace prizes as a result of their incredible efforts, the current President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and Leymah Gbowee.
The area where Phebe Hospital is located was one of the strongholds for some of the fighting groups, and Phebe had to evacuate on numerous occasions due to the chaos taking place around them. The dedicated staff evacuated to a safer area, and reopened there, returning to the hospital grounds when the situation calmed, refusing to close operations throughout the entire civil war. The hospital grounds were looted and ransacked repeatedly, with combatants ultimately removing almost everything they could, including connections to the central grid and wire, to generators, light bulbs and even toilets. Phebe Hospital & School of Nursing has been slowly rebuilding since that time, and then Ebola emerged, setting the entire country back.
       
Phebe Hospital & School of Nursing was founded by Lutheran, Methodist, and Episcopalian Churches in 1921. Lutheran Church support has dwindled over the years, and Methodist and Episcopalian Church support has all but evaporated as they focus on other priorities.
         
What is the goal?

This project will install a PV-diesel-battery microgrid that will cover
the majority of Phebe Hospital, Phebe School of Nursing, and the Bong County
Health Department daytime energy needs. The solar electric array will include a
small amount of battery back-up for periods without direct sunlight, and will
have the capability to turn on the backup generator when needed.  
Will Phebe staff be able to maintain the
system?
Phebe staff have the experience, tools, and skill set required in order
to maintain the system. The generator building is currently staffed 24 hours
per day, 7 days per week, and these staff will be utilized in order to maintain
the PV microgrid. Staff electricians have already installed over 20 small solar
electric systems for the regional health clinics, and this experience will
facilitate learning a similar system.
When will it be completed?
The system will be installed and commissioned 5 months after we achieve
the required funding level to ship components and complete the system
installation and training, once we have $600,000 in hand. 
Is this complicated?
Significant time and dedication is required to design the system
properly, and ensure it is executed correctly. But, systems like this are
becoming more and more common, and they are deployed all over the world where
there is no central electric grid.
Where do your people come from?
A small team from RREAL will join the Phebe staff during the installation
and training.
Do you need permission from local
authorities to install solar?
Because this system will be installed on private property held by the
Lutheran Church in Liberia, we will not need permission from local authorities.
Are you worried about someone stealing the
equipment?
The site selected for the installation will be conveniently located
directly across from the security gate at Phebe, which is always staffed. It
will also be fenced in and topped with razor wire.

 Redefining Sustainability

""Hō Mai Ka Pono"" is a Hawaiian phrase that emphasizes the profound healing process needed to restore the environment to a sustainable state.  The word pono describes the bare essence of our connection to ourselves and the natural world.  The feeling of pono guides our sense of balance, harmony and connection.  The understanding of pono guided traditional sustainability practices which allowed for the land and people to thrive.   Pono is the timeless universal principle underneath all the layers of environmental sustainability.

We plan to do this by publishing a photo book and do a traveling photographic exhibition around a controversial local tradition, called the “largateada”. The objective is to raise awareness and educate local communities. At same time we mean to sensitize governmental and environmental actors to the challenges local communities face when they cohabit with crocodiles. <strong>Our primary goal is education in order to raise awareness.</strong> We believe that only through awareness will we be able to guarantee the conservation of the species and a sustainable interaction between crocodiles and humans.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">But <strong>WE NEED YOU</strong> in order to get this book in the hands of those who most need it.</h3><p align=""justify"">We are a multidisciplinary team. I am a documentary photographer with many years of work accompanying social causes and fighting for human rights and Gabriela Segura<strong> </strong>is a psychologist with experience working with communities. We care about communities, especially the ones that are more vulnerable, and we care also about nature and wildlife. We firmly believe that sustainable conservation can only happen, if communities and wildlife find a way to coexist. And that is what this project is about.</p><p align=""justify"">The <i>Crocodylus</i> acutus is a species that exists from the south of the United States to the north of Perú and is one of the larger crocodile species. This impressive animal can reach lengths of 6.1 m (20 ft), weighing up to 907 kg (2,000 lb) and can live up to 70 years. One of the largest populations of <i>Crocodylus</i> acutus in Costa Rica can be found in the Tempisque River, in the north west of the country, in Guanacaste Province.</p><p align=""justify"">Along the banks of this river also live many men, women and children who are in constant contact with these giant lizards. Those are small vulnerable communities that subsist working in the sugar cane and watermelon plantations or extracting sand from the river. According to official statistics, poverty affects 23.6% of the population in Guanacaste, among then the communities along the Tempisque River.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511724378/jwm9taagkrlovyselh3t.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">This is one of the three EXCLUSIVE images of the ""Lagarteada"" that you will get as a postcard when contributing with US$ 25 to the campaign. You can also take a look at the other nice perks that we are offering to you.</p><h3 align=""center""><strong>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</strong></h3><p align=""justify"">In the Tempisque area of Costa Rica people have always hunted crocodiles in order to eat their meat, trade their skins and use their fat, which is believed to have medicinal power (especially that of the females). Another reason why the crocodiles have been hunted is the fear of attacks and the protection of livestock. In the last two hundred years, the hunting of the crocodiles took the species to the brink of extinction.</p><p align=""justify"">40 years ago the costarican government prohibited hunting crocodiles and as a result the species recovered. It is by no means out of danger, but its status has changed to vulnerable, and no longer in danger of extinction. Studies are currently being done to determine whether the population is stable or not yet.</p><p align=""justify"">The destruction of its natural habitat, due to development, deforestation, agricultural monoculture, destruction of wetlands and river pollution, to name but a few, causes that today the crocodile population is concentrating in ever smaller territories closer to human populations. This is the reason why the relationship between local communities and crocodiles is becoming more conflictive.  There are more incidents of people being attacked by crocodiles as well as crocodiles eating livestock. Economic and recreational activities along and in the river like fishing or bathing are increasingly more dangerous. Because of the vicinity of habitats crocodiles are more visible giving an erroneous impression of overpopulation. Lack of shade along the riverbanks and less than ideal nesting habitat leads to higher temperature in the nests, causing a gender imbalance. Higher temperatures lead to more males being born, increasing the aggressiveness of the animals. Another factor negatively affecting the gender ratio appears to be the use of the hormone 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) in the large scale fish farms raising Tilapias along the river.</p><p align=""justify"">In our experience in working with these communities, all the crocodile attacks against humans have something in common: lack of knowledge about the animal’s behavior in the communities living closest to them, leading to poor safety measures and ever more deteriorated habitats. People often don't know basic facts about the species, like for example how to distinguish males from females or when mating and nesting seasons take place. All of this is due to lack of attention, education and communication to these communities by the Costa Rican authorities.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OF OUR MODERN SOCIETIES</h3><p align=""justify"">The human-crocodile conflict in the Tempisque River is emblematic of the larger global context. It speaks about the global challenge our modern societies confront in terms of the tension between human development and the reduction of natural areas for wildlife. It also reflects the conflict between marginal communities with their traditional way of life and modern development. When it comes to conservation measures, local communities are often not taken into consideration, rendering protection policies less effective while leaving people affected by them with fewer options. It is urgent to find a balance that allows communities, especially marginal ones, to cohabit with these impressive animals whose habitat is continually shrinking. Costa Rica has made a good effort to save the crocodiles with some noticeable effect, but we firmly believe that education and knowledge in the people of those local communities is what can help to create the necessary and sustainable balance between humans and nature.</p><p align=""justify"">Let this project be emblematic for the alternatives and solutions that it implies.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513649213/ddzgpb9q9s0qvelkv4bs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">This beautiful crocodile-shaped ocarina, courtesy of the Chietón Morén indigenous market, is one of the perks that you will get as a very sincere “thank you” for supporting this important project. You can also take a look at the other nice and exclusive perks that we are offering to you.</p><h3 align=""center""><strong>THE LAGARTEADA AS THE EXEMPLIFICATION </strong></h3><h3 align=""center""><strong>OF THIS CONFLICT </strong></h3><p align=""justify"">The surroundings of the Tempisque River are a region that was inhabited by the indigenous Chorotega people long before the Spanish arrived to conquer the land. For the Chorotegas the crocodile was a sacred animal and a symbol of fertility. They used to have a big celebration during the spring equinox in which they hunted crocodiles in order to harvest their fat, meat and blood, which in their view had magical powers. During the colonization they protected their tradition with the religious syncretism that many indigenous populations used in these situations: they merged the crocodile hunting ceremony with the Holy week of the Spanish Catholic religion.</p><p align=""justify"">The historical records are spotty, but at some point about 200 years ago, when the Chorotegas were slowly being replaced by the ""criollos"", the mix between the indigenous and spanish races, a tradition started that resembles the ancestral one – the 'Lagarteada'.</p><p align=""justify"">The local word for the <i>Crocodylus</i> acutus is ""lagarto"", which basically means lizard, and the hunting of the lagarto is what is called the lagarteada. For decades it was an extremely cruel activity. The animal suffered because it was captured using harpoons and after the capture it was killed with knifes and its meat and fat distributed in the community. After the government prohibited crocodile hunting there has been an effort to preserve the tradition in a way that doesn´t harm the animal. The community of Ortega agreed to change several aspects of the activity, for instance the modern lagarteada no longer involves killing these great beast. After capturing the animal they bring it to the town, where a special pool has been built. The community gathers around the animal. The next morning, the same group of men bring the crocodile back to the river and set it free in the same place where it was captured, alive and without injuries. It has been done like this for many years already.</p><p align=""justify"">Then, in 2017 something went wrong: The animal died in captivity during the late night, causing outrage among environmentalists and conservationists. As a result, the community has been vilified, a national scandal erupted and environmental groups mobilized to prohibit the tradition. We are three months away from the next lagarteada and it´s not clear whether the activity will be carried out or not in 2018.</p><p align=""justify"">In a sense, the largateada tradition is at a crossroads. While some people see in this a conflict that needs to be resolved by repression and prohibitions, for us the conflict around the largateada is an educational opportunity that has the potential to benefit both, the <i>Crocodylus</i> acutus and the communities living near it.</p><h3 align=""center""><strong>OUR PROPOSAL: </strong></h3><h3 align=""center""><strong>TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CONTROVERSY</strong></h3><p align=""justify"">In May 2013, a group of scientist from the National University of Costa Rica conducted a research project in the Tempisque River Area.

We plan to do this by publishing a photo book and do a traveling photographic exhibition around a controversial local tradition, called the “largateada”. The objective is to raise awareness and educate local communities. At same time we mean to sensitize governmental and environmental actors to the challenges local communities face when they cohabit with crocodiles. Our primary goal is education in order to raise awareness. We believe that only through awareness will we be able to guarantee the conservation of the species and a sustainable interaction between crocodiles and humans.But WE NEED YOU in order to get this book in the hands of those who most need it.We are a multidisciplinary team. I am a documentary photographer with many years of work accompanying social causes and fighting for human rights and Gabriela Segura is a psychologist with experience working with communities. We care about communities, especially the ones that are more vulnerable, and we care also about nature and wildlife. We firmly believe that sustainable conservation can only happen, if communities and wildlife find a way to coexist. And that is what this project is about.The Crocodylus acutus is a species that exists from the south of the United States to the north of Perú and is one of the larger crocodile species. This impressive animal can reach lengths of 6.1 m (20 ft), weighing up to 907 kg (2,000 lb) and can live up to 70 years. One of the largest populations of Crocodylus acutus in Costa Rica can be found in the Tempisque River, in the north west of the country, in Guanacaste Province.Along the banks of this river also live many men, women and children who are in constant contact with these giant lizards. Those are small vulnerable communities that subsist working in the sugar cane and watermelon plantations or extracting sand from the river. According to official statistics, poverty affects 23.6% of the population in Guanacaste, among then the communities along the Tempisque River.This is one of the three EXCLUSIVE images of the ""Lagarteada"" that you will get as a postcard when contributing with US$ 25 to the campaign. You can also take a look at the other nice perks that we are offering to you.PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONIn the Tempisque area of Costa Rica people have always hunted crocodiles in order to eat their meat, trade their skins and use their fat, which is believed to have medicinal power (especially that of the females). Another reason why the crocodiles have been hunted is the fear of attacks and the protection of livestock. In the last two hundred years, the hunting of the crocodiles took the species to the brink of extinction.40 years ago the costarican government prohibited hunting crocodiles and as a result the species recovered. It is by no means out of danger, but its status has changed to vulnerable, and no longer in danger of extinction. Studies are currently being done to determine whether the population is stable or not yet.The destruction of its natural habitat, due to development, deforestation, agricultural monoculture, destruction of wetlands and river pollution, to name but a few, causes that today the crocodile population is concentrating in ever smaller territories closer to human populations. This is the reason why the relationship between local communities and crocodiles is becoming more conflictive.  There are more incidents of people being attacked by crocodiles as well as crocodiles eating livestock. Economic and recreational activities along and in the river like fishing or bathing are increasingly more dangerous. Because of the vicinity of habitats crocodiles are more visible giving an erroneous impression of overpopulation. Lack of shade along the riverbanks and less than ideal nesting habitat leads to higher temperature in the nests, causing a gender imbalance. Higher temperatures lead to more males being born, increasing the aggressiveness of the animals. Another factor negatively affecting the gender ratio appears to be the use of the hormone 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) in the large scale fish farms raising Tilapias along the river.In our experience in working with these communities, all the crocodile attacks against humans have something in common: lack of knowledge about the animal’s behavior in the communities living closest to them, leading to poor safety measures and ever more deteriorated habitats. People often don't know basic facts about the species, like for example how to distinguish males from females or when mating and nesting seasons take place. All of this is due to lack of attention, education and communication to these communities by the Costa Rican authorities.THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OF OUR MODERN SOCIETIESThe human-crocodile conflict in the Tempisque River is emblematic of the larger global context. It speaks about the global challenge our modern societies confront in terms of the tension between human development and the reduction of natural areas for wildlife. It also reflects the conflict between marginal communities with their traditional way of life and modern development. When it comes to conservation measures, local communities are often not taken into consideration, rendering protection policies less effective while leaving people affected by them with fewer options. It is urgent to find a balance that allows communities, especially marginal ones, to cohabit with these impressive animals whose habitat is continually shrinking. Costa Rica has made a good effort to save the crocodiles with some noticeable effect, but we firmly believe that education and knowledge in the people of those local communities is what can help to create the necessary and sustainable balance between humans and nature.Let this project be emblematic for the alternatives and solutions that it implies.This beautiful crocodile-shaped ocarina, courtesy of the Chietón Morén indigenous market, is one of the perks that you will get as a very sincere “thank you” for supporting this important project. You can also take a look at the other nice and exclusive perks that we are offering to you.THE LAGARTEADA AS THE EXEMPLIFICATION OF THIS CONFLICT The surroundings of the Tempisque River are a region that was inhabited by the indigenous Chorotega people long before the Spanish arrived to conquer the land. For the Chorotegas the crocodile was a sacred animal and a symbol of fertility. They used to have a big celebration during the spring equinox in which they hunted crocodiles in order to harvest their fat, meat and blood, which in their view had magical powers. During the colonization they protected their tradition with the religious syncretism that many indigenous populations used in these situations: they merged the crocodile hunting ceremony with the Holy week of the Spanish Catholic religion.The historical records are spotty, but at some point about 200 years ago, when the Chorotegas were slowly being replaced by the ""criollos"", the mix between the indigenous and spanish races, a tradition started that resembles the ancestral one – the 'Lagarteada'.The local word for the Crocodylus acutus is ""lagarto"", which basically means lizard, and the hunting of the lagarto is what is called the lagarteada. For decades it was an extremely cruel activity. The animal suffered because it was captured using harpoons and after the capture it was killed with knifes and its meat and fat distributed in the community. After the government prohibited crocodile hunting there has been an effort to preserve the tradition in a way that doesn´t harm the animal. The community of Ortega agreed to change several aspects of the activity, for instance the modern lagarteada no longer involves killing these great beast. After capturing the animal they bring it to the town, where a special pool has been built. The community gathers around the animal. The next morning, the same group of men bring the crocodile back to the river and set it free in the same place where it was captured, alive and without injuries. It has been done like this for many years already.Then, in 2017 something went wrong: The animal died in captivity during the late night, causing outrage among environmentalists and conservationists. As a result, the community has been vilified, a national scandal erupted and environmental groups mobilized to prohibit the tradition. We are three months away from the next lagarteada and it´s not clear whether the activity will be carried out or not in 2018.In a sense, the largateada tradition is at a crossroads. While some people see in this a conflict that needs to be resolved by repression and prohibitions, for us the conflict around the largateada is an educational opportunity that has the potential to benefit both, the Crocodylus acutus and the communities living near it.OUR PROPOSAL: TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CONTROVERSYIn May 2013, a group of scientist from the National University of Costa Rica conducted a research project in the Tempisque River Area. After hundreds of interviews they concluded that:
80% of surveyed residents said that they had not received any information about the crocodiles and approximately the same proportion said that they were interested in environmental education activities.
There was an inefficient communication process between scientists, environmental educators, Ministry of Environment, wildlife managers, and those who really need the information (being the communities).

<p>Gris Gris Gardens is a hydroponic farming company that provides fresh produce to the local food community in New Orleans, Louisiana. We will grow produce and herbs for restaurants and local apothecaries and aim to support the growing local food movement in New Orleans. The city lacks resources for urban farming and future programs that will lead to better nutrition for the community. With a container farm, GGG can convert an entire acre of food production within 320 square feet. What a great movement for our future?! </p>
<p>Our world is changing. More people than ever are now living in tightly populated, urban areas, and there’s an increasing demand for locally grown and sustainably produced food. People want to know the story behind the meal on their plates and the products they use. And even city dwellers want their food to be fresh and full of nutrients, not pre-packaged and shipped from thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Our climate is also continuing to evolve. Extreme weather conditions are becoming more common, and land and water are becoming scarcer. Large-scale food production and distribution has had a significant impact on the earth’s ecosystem, and it’s continuing to affect our water levels and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Transparency is key to understanding where and how food is produced and Gris Gris Gardens is committed to improving transparency in the restaurant industry by growing ‘hyper-local’ produce in one of the most innovative hydroponic systems available, Freight Farms’ Greenery.  Growing in the Greenery enables us to provide unparalleled transparency in all operations from seed to harvest and provides our customers with the certainty that they are purchasing produce grown via the best agricultural practices available.</p>
<h3>Personal Connection to the Company </h3>
<p>Gris Gris Gardens has become a project of mine that aligns with my love for education. I have been in the teaching profession for 13 years and looking for movement outside of the walls of a classroom. I want to use the container farm as a source of income, by selling crops to businesses in need of fresh local produce. I am looking to set up programs to educate children/young adults (and possibly even adults) on the hydroponic growing system that can turn any person into a modern-day farmer.  It is an important mission of mine to contually connect kids to the power of nature. This would be through teaching young generations that they can make small movements to be more self-sustainable with growing food.  </p>
<h3>Our Product</h3>
<p>We will initially grow greens, herbs, and vegetables and sell it to local food suppliers.  This type of cash crop takes just a couple weeks to reach maturity and we estimate harvesting every month of the year.  </p>
<p>Our crops are hyper-local, meaning that our crops are grown in the community where it will be consumed, and is thus considered a premium and differentiated product by the market, commanding a higher price point that even organic foods.  This differentiation is what enables us to command the higher price as opposed to the general wholesale price.</p>
<h3>Funding </h3>
<p>The funding of the container farm will allow me to set up this project within the New Orleans community and provide learning experiences that will benefit all ages. The funding I am looking for is the container farm itself, rental of urban land, transportation of the container, and additional start-up costs.</p>
<h3>Let's CHAT</h3>
<p>I am available to talk more about this project and answer any questions you may additionally have at this point. As you can tell, this is a project that fulfills a great need within our community.</p>

This would be through teaching young generations that they can make small movements to be more self-sustainable with growing food.  
Our Product
We will initially grow greens, herbs, and vegetables and sell it to local food suppliers.  This type of cash crop takes just a couple weeks to reach maturity and we estimate harvesting every month of the year.  
Our crops are hyper-local, meaning that our crops are grown in the community where it will be consumed, and is thus considered a premium and differentiated product by the market, commanding a higher price point that even organic foods.  This differentiation is what enables us to command the higher price as opposed to the general wholesale price.
Funding 
The funding of the container farm will allow me to set up this project within the New Orleans community and provide learning experiences that will benefit all ages. The funding I am looking for is the container farm itself, rental of urban land, transportation of the container, and additional start-up costs.
Let's CHAT
I am available to talk more about this project and answer any questions you may additionally have at this point. As you can tell, this is a project that fulfills a great need within our community.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>WHO’S IN CHARGE OF INTERNATIONAL GOVERNANCE OF THE CLIMATE?</strong></p>
<p>Is it the UN? Is it the Paris Accords or the IPCC? Is it USA and China? Is it a world parliament? Or, maybe we are doing great jobs nationally in many countries, but not internationally. The answer to the problem might just be that no one person or institution is responsible or accountable at the global level to ensure we do not reach the climate catastrophe point of no return. GLOBAL PROBLEMS REQUIRE GLOBAL SOLUTIONS.</p>
<p><strong>JOIN US </strong>at the CLIMATE DEMOCRACY &amp; JUSTICE SUMMIT in Greece, this 22-26 July. We will start in the Island of Corfu, and move to the mountains of Epirus, Greece, for 5 days of seminars, training, and brainstorming workshops conducted with a panel of international experts on international law, environment, and global governance.</p>
<p><strong>SUPPORT US </strong>to train <strong>youth climate activists into ambassadors</strong>. This year, we will be selecting two youth climate defenders from each continent plus the sinking islands, to attend the summit with their expenses fully paid and become our ambassadors. Armed with this knowledge, they will engage with people and national governments and to become stakeholders and representatives to the international institutions. They can fight for all of us to be represented in climate governance. Let ""we the peoples,"" especially our youth,  govern the climate!</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>We expect the entire seminar to cost about €100 000. Half of that will just be the costs of sponsoring the participation of the twelve climate ambassadors from around the world, and that’s what we want your help in raising. We have been talking to prominent youth defenders from Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the South Pacific, incredible and passionate young people who want to come together to make real change. It can’t happen without your help to pay for the logistics – transportation, meals, accommodation, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What do you get for contributing? </strong>In the <strong><i>short run, </i></strong>you get what we all get:  youth ambassadors that would represent us in governance of the climate, fighting to make all of our voices heard.

<h3>Resumen</h3>
<p>Somos, Alicia Arribas Moyano y Federica Frenda, guardianas de <strong>el</strong> <strong>S</strong><strong>antuario de las Abejas</strong> fundado hace 8 años en el Valle Sagrado de los Incas en Perú por Jerry Freeman, un maestro apicultor que sentía la urgencia de proteger a las abejas: animal  sagrado e indispensable para el equilibrio de la vida y en grave peligro y con ella, toda la humanidad.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Las verdaderas beneficiarias de la campaña van a ser 500 000 abejas.</strong><br/>La labor de el Santuario de las Abejas consiste en proporcionarles las condiciones ideales para su salud y fortaleza, dándose el aprovechamiento de sus productos como la miel, sólo en momento de mucha abundancia. </p>
<p><br/>Es un proyecto<strong> totalmente auto-sostenido</strong> por las actividades de sensibilización que organizamos trabajando con escuelas, creando eventos, con círculos de sanación y generando productos naturales de cosmética y medicina. También difundimos la importancia del cuidado de la abeja y lo hacemos concreto introduciendo colmenas en el hogar para que cada vez seamos más guardianes conscientes de la importancia de esta misión. <br/><br/>Durante estos 8 años, <strong>hemos tenido que cambiar de espacio 4 veces</strong>. El terreno donde nos encontramos actualmente está en venta y sentimos, guardianas y abejas, que ya ha llegado el momento de conseguir un terreno propio para que todo el proyecto esté por fin seguro y pueda crecer tranquilo. </p>
<p>Tenemos 4 meses para recaudar los fondos, tiempo que nos queda de alquiler del terreno. </p>

<h3>El impacto</h3>
<p>Conservar a la abeja implica muchos <strong>beneficios para la comunidad local y el mundo entero</strong> a distintos niveles:  </p>
<p>- la abeja es la polinizadora fundamental indispensable para el mantenimiento de la biodiversidad y de la que dependen el 70% de los alimentos que consumimos.<br/>- la abeja nos brinda medicinas naturales de excelente calidad (miel, propoleo y cera).<br/>- la abeja tiene una vibración que permite conectarse con el Todo</p>
<p>No todos podemos tener colmenas en nuestro hogar y cuidar directamente a las abejas pero, apoyando esta campaña,  todos podemos volvernos guardianes de este Santuario y de esta manera contribuir en la disminución de la extinción de este ser indispensable. </p>
<p>El proyecto existe desde hace más de 8 años y está funcionando cada vez con más éxito. Lo único que falta es un terreno propio y una infraestructura que garantice la continuidad estable  del proyecto donde crear una escuela de guardianes de las abejas y de la biodiversidad. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Riesgos y desafíos</h3>
<p>El mayor riesgo del proyecto son las mudanzas a las que nos vemos obligadas por no tener un terreno propio, ya que es en estos movimientos donde las colmenas se ven impactadas y algunas no son capaces de sobrevivir a la mudanza, reduciéndose con ellas la población de abejas.</p>
<p>Nuestro mayor desafío reside realmente en el aspecto económico. Dedicarnos plenamente a la protección de las abejas no nos permite desarrollar muchas actividades lucrativas. Comprar un terreno en esta zona es hoy un gran reto. </p>

The World 2016 is a sailing mission to raise support and spread awareness of
<b>rhino preservation</b> to communities everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Short
Description:</b></p>
<p>Hugh

<p><b>Long
Description:</b> <br/></p>
<p>Rhino
poaching is driven by demand for rhino horn in Asia and, in particular, Vietnam.
It is used in traditional medicine, but more commonly now as a status symbol to
display success and wealth.</p>
<p>It
is unfortunately on the increase – spiraling since 2007 and pushing the
remaining 20,000 Rhino closer to extinction, with the possibility of <b>deaths
overtaking births during 2016.</b></p>
<p>Hugh
and Sara hope to reverse and reduce the demand for rhino horn by <b>developing
international awareness and support</b> against the illegal syndicates who are
responsible for the continued slaughter of these magnificent animals.</p>
<p><b>Plans: </b></p>
<p><b></b>The boat is our environmentally-friendly and
economical mode of transport, home and office. It will serve as accommodation
for working guests and a source of income to sustain her and raise funds for projects
back home. </p>
<p>We plan to deliver our message through
the following platforms:</p>
<p><b>Fund Raising</b>: </p>
<p>Rhino conservation needs
financial resources to close the gap with the poaching syndicates. The <b>funds
raised locally nowhere near match the funding</b> required to stop poaching. Rhino
Ocean Warriors intends to gain one million individual paid commitments of 1
Euro through our declaration, of which <b>42% will be awarded to</b> <b>Project Rhino
KZN</b>. All future funds raised and in excess of the initial €136,000.00 for the boat will be split 42%
with Project Rhino KZN and the balance retained for operational costs.

<h3>The Issues &amp; how we can ALL help</h3>
<p>Serenity Acres will not be just a farm, just an animal sanctuary, just a plant nursery.  It will bring all of these businesses and causes together to confront some of the worst problems that affect our world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutritious food availability- Many communities around the U.S. and the world are classified as ""Food Deserts"", this means that the people have little or no access to fresh produce and nutritious food.  We at Serenity Acres believe that with the proper support and community education programs, we can drastically increase the quality of life for millions of people around the globe.  Starting here at home.</li>
<li>Animal cruelty and abandonment- Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized.  thankfully this number has been decreasing significantly since 2011, but we at Serenity Acres have the training and the will to help.  We just need your support.</li>
<li>Climate change- Scientists have confirmed that if we do not drastically change our CO2 emission rate in the next 10 years, there will be irreversible harm done to our planet.  At Serenity Acres, we are dedicated to leaving the planet healthier for future generations.  Ethiopia has recently taken the initiative and planted a record shattering 350 million trees in 1 day, ALL to help tackle the climate change crisis.  Your donation will help us attempt to one day break that record with a global day of tree planting!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Our goal is to raise $2,000,000.  This will allow us to...</h3>
<p>We have the training, the will power and the passion.  We just need your financial support to jump start us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase 40+ Acres in the California desert and build infrastructure for animal housing and rehabilitation, staff housing, community education rooms and farm equipment.</li>
<li>The California desert is not the ideal farm location, but it is not a lost cause and it deserves a chance at being revived with sustainable agriculture practices and consistent reforestation.</li>
<li>We set a high goal because the more funds we can secure, the more good we can do!  No matter what is raised Serenity Acres will come to life.  Your donations now will just give us the boost to start NOW and start STRONG.  Help us so we can help you.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Immediate Impact</h3>
<p>Some issues, like climate change obviously cant be fixed overnight, but thousands of Americans, including the family behind Serenity Acres, will benefit from the almost immediate availability of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to access and low cost fresh, nutritious produce including annual and perennial vegetables plus, rare and tropical fruit.</li>
<li>Consistent produce donations to local food banks and homeless shelters.</li>
<li>Our family will be able to stop struggling paycheck to paycheck, and can begin fighting to make life better for everyone else in return.</li>

<h3>The Living Corals Initiative</h3>
<p>Many are aware of coral reef depletion around the world but they also tend to underestimate the extent of damage. As it stands, we have already lost 27% of the worlds coral reefs.

<h3>Why The Need To Save The Corals?</h3>
<p>Apart from looking pretty underwater, coral reefs are a <strong>hugely vital</strong> part of the marine ecosystem.</p>
<p><i>Fun Fact: Coral reefs protect coastlines from the damaging effects of wave action and tropical storms. </i></p>
<p>Did you know the Indian Ocean earthquake and Tsunami disasters in 2004 which hit Indonesian shores cost the lives of vast swaths of coral reef. The existence of coral reefs in strategic areas prevented more coastline damage from occurring, particularly in Malaysia and Thailand. This came at the expense of coral reefs which were horribly damaged in the process!</p>
<p><i>Coral reefs provide habitats and shelter for many marine organisms</i></p>
<p>Save Nemo! A diverse range of marine life species call these coral reefs home, giving natural communities survival options when environmental conditions and climates change. The destruction of coral reefs poses a great threat to species for which there is limited diversity. The logic is simple: the destruction of coral reefs contributes to the destruction of marine life which then provides the catalyst for structural disruptions to the global ecosystem.</p>

Many are aware of coral reef depletion around the world but they also tend to underestimate the extent of damage. As it stands, we have already lost 27% of the worlds coral reefs. Should the present rate of destruction continue, 60% of the world's coral reefs will be destroyed over the next 30 years!
We are a social enterprise driving efforts to promote marine life conservation programs via:
1) coral planting activities; 
2) biodiversity conservation programs; and 
3) the promotion of ethical diving expeditions

We have been in business educating about cob and Natural Building for 4 years, and we are now ready to open our doors to an influx of new students with your support.We’re ready to build a working model for the future. Our educational workshops are ready to triple in numbers, but we just need to create the space for this to happen in.Additional funds are needed to purchase some acres of land, build school infrastructure, and to construct our first code-approved earthen buildings.Cob Guest HouseRammed Earth HouseThis Cob House, LLC, our students, and our supporters are committed to building a unique place of learning in order to serve the world with the skills of earthen construction methods and sustainable systems.Our Indiegogo campaign goal of $100,000 will help us reach our Phase One funding requirements. If we can raise more than $100,000 here, then GREAT! We aim to have the school open for students by April 2017. After that, we aim to reach our Phase Two goal of $200,000 in order to build a permanent classroom for students and to purchase some heavy machinery. Our Phase Three goal of $250,000 will be for a two-story Georgian-style home constructed with rammed earth (all code-approved).Your financial support – small or large - could ensure that the target is met.
The heart that gives, gathers.-  Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching
Donations over $100 will be recognized with their names engraved on our school’s adobe block “Wall of Supporters”. These hand crafted adobe blocks represent the building blocks contributed by our supporters who make the vision of our school a reality. The proposed “Wall of Supporters” will become a stunning representation of the support from students, friends, and our global community.It will showcase the depth of support our school has received and its visual impact will make everyone proud of what we’ve been able to build together. It’s a step toward helping restore Nature and to be more responsible with how we treat the environment. And of course we get some amazing building technology for our future!The perks offered are listed on the right column of the page. Every individual has the ability to make a difference in the world. Your support to our school will show how true this can be. Together, we can have a future where we are conscious of our use of natural resources and we can become proper stewards to nature and our planet.Your support will contribute to a future with:
Increased use of earth as a building material
A decrease of toxic materials used in common household building materials
A decrease in deforestation by less demand for lumber
Your support will carry these benefits:

We can hold many state of the art educational workshops each year

We can offer free learning opportunities to the disadvantaged, and to children
We can contribute to an official building code for cob in the United States
We can continue to provide free knowledge and services to our thousands of online followers

We can continue to produce new cutting edge educational video courses and DVDs

We will be able to offer classes on gardening, permaculture, homesteading, and healthy living
We will be able to continue to offer some of the lowest workshop prices
Students will be able to experience living in cob/earthen buildings during their workshop stay
We will have potential national TV show production opportunities. We can reach a much bigger audience this way to promote earthen building in a good light.
We will be able to create jobs for other Natural Builders
We need your support. Even if you are unable to contribute a financial donation, you can still help us:

</div><p><strong>Our story</strong></p><p>The goal of the CGS project is to revive an entire region which has huge potential, but is repeatedly hit by drought due to deforestation. Long term human mismanagement is the cause of this situation and it is now our duty to ensure water returns to Caatinga.</p><p>This is why we are going to set up an agroforest predestined to grow bigger and bigger.</p><p>We believe that the participation of people from several indigenous ethnic groups in the realization of our project will also strongly motivate others to follow this imprint. Indeed, in the beginning our plantation will be in the form of a footprint. This symbol brings us to reflect on the imprint that our everyday actions leave behind us…The Caatinga Giant Steps project will be implemented as a living entity and will therefore become a constantly growing imprint.    </p><p>                                                                                                                                                                                          Caatinga is a magical place just waiting to blossom once again!</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>Nossa história</strong></p><p> </p><p>O objetivo do projeto Passo Gigante da Caatinga é fazer reviver uma região que possui um imenso potencial, mas que é frequentemente atingida pela seca devido ao desmatamento. Muito tempo de má gestão humana é a causa da atual situação mas agora é nosso dever fazer a água retornar para a Caatinga.</p><p>Por isso nos vamos reconstruir a agrofloresta que será predestinada a crescer cada vez mais.</p><p>Nos acreditamos que a participação dos povos provenientes de várias etnias indígenas no nosso projeto será também fortemente motivadora para outros seguirem nosso trabalho de reflorestamento, nossa pegada. De fato, o começo da plantação será na forma de uma pegada. Este símbolo nos leva a refletir sobre a impressão que nossas ações cotidianas deixam para trás. O projeto “Passo Gigante da Caatinga” será implementado como uma entidade viva e, portanto, vai se tornar uma crescente marca.</p><p>Caatinga é um lugar mágico apenas esperando para florescer outra vez.</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>Team:</strong></p><p>Our Caatinga team was formed during the realization of the project Giant Steps in Roraima in Amazonia.

Our storyThe goal of the CGS project is to revive an entire region which has huge potential, but is repeatedly hit by drought due to deforestation. Long term human mismanagement is the cause of this situation and it is now our duty to ensure water returns to Caatinga.This is why we are going to set up an agroforest predestined to grow bigger and bigger.We believe that the participation of people from several indigenous ethnic groups in the realization of our project will also strongly motivate others to follow this imprint. Indeed, in the beginning our plantation will be in the form of a footprint. This symbol brings us to reflect on the imprint that our everyday actions leave behind us…The Caatinga Giant Steps project will be implemented as a living entity and will therefore become a constantly growing imprint.                                                                                                                                                                                              Caatinga is a magical place just waiting to blossom once again!_________________________________________________________________________________Nossa história O objetivo do projeto Passo Gigante da Caatinga é fazer reviver uma região que possui um imenso potencial, mas que é frequentemente atingida pela seca devido ao desmatamento. Muito tempo de má gestão humana é a causa da atual situação mas agora é nosso dever fazer a água retornar para a Caatinga.Por isso nos vamos reconstruir a agrofloresta que será predestinada a crescer cada vez mais.Nos acreditamos que a participação dos povos provenientes de várias etnias indígenas no nosso projeto será também fortemente motivadora para outros seguirem nosso trabalho de reflorestamento, nossa pegada. De fato, o começo da plantação será na forma de uma pegada. Este símbolo nos leva a refletir sobre a impressão que nossas ações cotidianas deixam para trás. O projeto “Passo Gigante da Caatinga” será implementado como uma entidade viva e, portanto, vai se tornar uma crescente marca.Caatinga é um lugar mágico apenas esperando para florescer outra vez._________________________________________________________________________________Team:Our Caatinga team was formed during the realization of the project Giant Steps in Roraima in Amazonia. We grouped together on a nowadays rather unusual principle: mutual trust. And it worked!!! This is why we continue together and have every good reason to think that we will succeed again ...!                                                                                                                                                              Since we started working on the Caatinga project, our team considerably expanded.For the creation of the giant footprint in Caatinga, our team will be assisted by people from a wide variety of backgrounds ( cowboys, artists, farmers, university researchers, musicians, minstrels, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, translators, historians, etc.) and ethnicities: Atikum, Baniwa, Fulni-ô, Kiriri, Makuxi, Pankara, Pankararé, Pankararu, Pipipa, Trukà, Tukano, Tuxà, Quilombolas: Catolé, Luanda and Mirandiba.Professor Martinho Carvalho, in addition to being a professor at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, coordinates the CRad - Reference Center for the recovery of degraded areas in the Caatinga Biome, also connected to the university's activities. Among his activities at CRad, is the research and development of forest recovery models, in particular the study of animals from the Caatinga biome that contribute decisively to the propagation and germination of seeds.__________________________________________________________________________________ Equipe: Nossa equipe Caatinga foi formada durante a realização do projeto Pegada Gigante em Roraima na Amazônia.  Nos agruparemos agora sob um novo princípio: mútua confiança.

The SAD Reality



In the last 20 years old, natural grown forests were literally massacred all over the Romanian territory. Forests occupy only 27 % of the country, with 6 % below the European average, and timber harvesting in Romania is in a much faster rate than the rest of Europe.
Romania had 6.515 million hectares of forest, occupying 27.4% of the country where 51 % of the forest belongs to the state, the remaining being private property. During the period 1990-2011 there were 366,000 hectares of forest cleared, both from state forestry departments or private ones, as stated by a report made by the Romanian Court of Auditors, but according to a same study conducted by Greenpeace Romania the situation is much worse meaning that over 3 hectares of forest are being cleared every single hour!

The ""TREE Revolution""campaign
 

Our main Goal for this campaign is to successfully plant 6850 Red Oaks (Quercus rubra) on a total surface of 100.000 sqm (10 Hectars). On each hectar we will plant 685 saplings each of them having enough space for optimal development (16 sqm).If we manage this, we can then go to a next level, setting our goals even higher.Calculations have been made in order to define the total funds needed:
for each 10 USD you donate a new Red Oak Tree is born. Beside this amount, all other costs (until the sapling is safely planted into the ground) will be provided by us (transportation, necessary planting tools, fertilizer, watering, etc.)
furthermore we have created simple but unique Perks that will make you remember this campaign and the fact that YOU helped NATURE! 

if the total funds are not raised, we will plant as much as possible, meaning that for each 6.850 USD collected, a hectar (10.000 sqm) of a young Red Oak forest will be borned, 

   
Importance of trees - General facts 
 1. trees help regulate the Earth's climate because they store nearly 300 billion tons of carbon - 40 times more than the annual emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. When forests are destroyed, the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere as greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change - the carbon dioxide;
2. trees live longer than all organisms on Earth;
3. trees get about 90% of their food from the atmosphere and only 10% from the soil;
4. trees cover nearly 30% of the earth's surface;
5. securing land by planting trees is the best way to fight soil erosion and landslides.
  
Why Red Oak?
 The Red Oak tree (Quercus rubra) is a species originating from North America and was introduced in Romania in the 1900's throughout the country, using both decorative purposes as well as forest trees.

Red Oaks are not only simple trees but also a food source for both domestic and wild animals, due to its fruits, the well known acorns. Humans have also found throughout time, different uses for acorns, ranging from medical purposes to recreational, spiritual ones.

</h3><p><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong></p><p>We are a team of scientists from the Department of Geography, Ecology and Natural Protection in the South West University ""Neofit Rilski"" Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria. We have been working on numerous Environmental projects in the field of Hydrology, Climatology, Geology,  Geomorphology and many others.</p><br/><br/> <h1>Help us to develop a web based Flood forecasting and warning system for small river basins!</h1><p> </p><p> </p><h3>
<b></b> </h3><h3 align=""left""><b>What is this?</b></h3><p><br/>Traditional flood forecasting and warning systems are based on manual calculations made by hydrologists or through standalone computer programs. The main drawbacks of these methods are long forecasting times due to their time-consuming nature, reliance on individual knowledge, lack of communication, or in the absence of experts, etc. </p><p>We propose:</p><p>A Web-based flood forecasting system (WFFS) for small river basins, that includes five main modules: </p><p>real-time rainfall data conversion, model-driven rainfall-runoff forecasting, model calibration, precipitation forecasting, and flood analysis, </p><p>as presented here in this project. </p><p>The WFFS brings significant convenience to personnel engaged in flood<br/>forecasting and control, allowing real-time contribution from a wide range of<br/>experts who may be located elsewhere in times of emergency.

We have been working on numerous Environmental projects in the field of Hydrology, Climatology, Geology,  Geomorphology and many others. Help us to develop a web based Flood forecasting and warning system for small river basins!  
 What is this?Traditional flood forecasting and warning systems are based on manual calculations made by hydrologists or through standalone computer programs. The main drawbacks of these methods are long forecasting times due to their time-consuming nature, reliance on individual knowledge, lack of communication, or in the absence of experts, etc. We propose:A Web-based flood forecasting system (WFFS) for small river basins, that includes five main modules: real-time rainfall data conversion, model-driven rainfall-runoff forecasting, model calibration, precipitation forecasting, and flood analysis, as presented here in this project. The WFFS brings significant convenience to personnel engaged in floodforecasting and control, allowing real-time contribution from a wide range ofexperts who may be located elsewhere in times of emergency. The conceptualframework and detailed components of the proposed WFFS, which employs amulti-tiered architecture, are illustrated. Our multi-tiered architecture offersgreat flexibility, portability, reusability and reliability.

We are a small team of engineers from Trinity College Dublin who, over the past 5 years, have developed and field tested a technology that can produce electricity from a low cost and locally made efficient biomass cookstove. The stove is much more efficient than the traditional 3-stone open fires currently used in many developing countries and thus slows down deforestation and CO2 production and dramatically improves people's health and safety. The electrical generator is simple, robust and locally made and can charge mobile phones, LED lanterns and radios...all this while simply preparing the daily meals.







Collaborating with the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs (Irish Aid) as well as the NGO Concern Universal, we have been developing the technology in Malawi, Africa. We have done this by learning from the Malawian people who have used trial versions of the stove generator and then adapting the design so it is suited for the people who want and need them. In a way, the technology is being designed by the Malawian people themselves.



Our dream is a clean hybrid heat and electricity generating technology that reduces deforestation, improves health & safety while saving and possibly earning  precious income. It will be locally manufactured and sold making it low cost and maintainable while creating jobs and income: it will be truly sustainable.

We believe that the  µPower Cookstove can provide the Power to Change Lives.

Note: This is an OPEN SOURCE PROJECT. All data, technical specifications, designs, hardware and software and any other relevant information is free and accessible to anyone!


What We Have









We have been developing this technology since 2011, spending many months every year in Malawi performing field trials and adapting the design to its current embodiment.

The µPower Cookstove works and there is a huge demand for them already. Word has spread throughout Malawi and even other parts of Africa. 


We have the technology, we have the demand and now we need the supply.

“It has to be something people can make and sell in Malawi and that others will want to buy.”  Professor Anthony Robinson, as quoted in a recent article in the Irish Times.



What we need now is the spark that will ignite a wildfire roll out of µPower Cookstoves across all of Malawi; who knows where it may go from there? With numbers potentially in the millions in Malawi alone, this requires infrastructure:


● $160,000 will finance the people, material and equipment needed to build close-to-consumer assembly plants, train local women's groups in the assembly, maintenance and repair of the stoves and micro-finance small entrepreneurial businesses for sales and distribution.
● $70,000 will provide the funding for the first 1000 µPower Cookstoves which will be targeted at the most vulnerable families in the remote regions of the Thyolo district of Malawi. This is also where the current ceramic production facility for the µPower Cookstove is located (see picture below).





Albeit a moderate initial volume of 1000 units, the important thing is that the campaign will have established the infrastructure needed to produce and sell the next 1000, then 10,000 then 100,000. Help us make it to a million homes where having electricity  is not even a dream.
Every cent raised above our target will allow us to expand infrastructure to other regions in Malawi and hugely accelerate deployment to all those in need.Here is a short video telling the whole story, enjoy!



What You Get Our perks include a mixture of personal messages, real Malawian recipes from the remote villages, audio and video files and thermoelectric generator do-it-yourself manuals and kits. For larger donations, come to Malawi and take part in the project for a few days; see the assembly plants and enjoy a meal with a family using the µPower Cookstove...maybe charge your phone while you are there! See the real impact of your contribution while enjoying the hospitality of these generous people in the beautiful country of Malawi.





The Impact
 


""90% of people in Malawi have no access to electricity"" BBC correspondent Roger Harrabin reports on BBC World Service about the energy and environmental crisis in Malawi during the recent United Nations COP21 climate conference in Paris.
In fact, only about 1% of the rural poor of Malawi have access to grid electricity. Almost every family cooks over a 3-stone open fire. This means,  Malawi is almost completely deforested and still losing over 2000 square kilometres every year. Smoke and toxic gas from indoor cooking ranks ahead of unsafe water as a cause of death in developing countries. It is the world's #1 killer of children under 5 years old. Poorest quality light or complete darkness which translates into lost income and studying opportunities.
Time and lost income opportunities scavenging and transporting firewood and walking for hours to phone charging stations...several times every week!
Precious income spent on phone charging; could be a month's income or more every year!

Efficient cooking on a simple stove together with a robust and sustainable thermoelectric generator system SAVES TIME, SAVES MONEY, SAVES LIVES.

The Open source Model of Technology Development



This is an OPEN SOURCE project: there are no patents, trade secrets or any other type of intellectual property protection. 
We strongly believe that the free and open communication of ideas, knowledge and experience is the only way that a technology like this can evolve into something viable and impactful. Below are some examples of how our open source model has been carried out so far;

We publish all of the technical information of the design and performance in the top academic Energy journals e.g. Applied Energy, Energy for Sustainable Development.
The Burn Design Lab wanted to test a thermoelectric generator system for their ""plancha"" style stove. They reached out to us and we designed, constructed and shipped a system to them that was then trialled in Guatemala.
We have had many voice and video calls with groups from around the world; ranging from NGOs to high school students, including a team from the East Salem High School in Oregon who were recently awarded a 2015-16 Lemelson-MIT InvenTeam grant to generate electricity from cooking in the developing world.
We have assembled and shipped various hardware components to groups trying to design their own electricity-producing cookstoves.
We have commissioned small video documentaries about the project in order to reach out through social media. Check out this documentary of our very first field trial in the Balaka District of Malawi in 2011.



Below shows examples of how knowledge is dissemination in peer reviewed academic journals...notice how far reaching knowledge can be!






Risks & Challenges

 This is an ambitious project and with that there are real risks and significant challenges. Some of these we already understand and anticipate from our years of experience, whereas others are yet to reveal themselves, and be assured, they will. These may be technical, behavioural or even societal. However,  we do not see risks and challenges as barriers, we see them as opportunities to learn and discover. This is precisely why we are where we are today.

We are a team of engineers
and development professionals that have worked together for many years on this
project. Through thick and thin we have brought the technology to the point
where it is now at the stage where we believe it is ready for mass deployment.
Despite the challenges that lay ahead, we are ready and prepared to take them
on because the people we are serving deserve it.
    Other Ways You Can Help Awareness and education is so important. Even as seasoned world travellers, our preconceived notions about  Malawi and the Malawian people  were so wildly off the mark that it goes to show that only education and experience can truly open your eyes and heart to the beauty and bounty of the earth and its people. The Malawian people are some of the kindest, most generous, hard working family and community orientated people we have ever had the pleasure of knowing.

If we raise extra funding we will increase the capacity as soon as we have perfected the first phase. We have enough land available to create production in excess of 10 tons per month of fish plus vegetables.


    The Impact If we can start this exciting project it will have a profound impact on our small village. Jobs will be created not only in the production and sales of the produce, but also in the construction and maintenance of the site. The ultimate goal is to expand production and have an onsite processing/packing plant for export sales.
    Risks & Challenges The main risk lies in the maintenance of the correct water quality. This is achieved by testing the water twice daily and making any necessary adjustments to the water flow through the filters. The main challenge will be training the staff to understand the importance of this. Due to the inconsistency of the local electricity supply, our own generator will provide an automatic back-up supply in the event of power cuts 24/7
I have been researching the Aquaponic production methods for over four years and believe that I have the knowledge to overcome any pitfalls that may arise.

<p>""We live in a defining moment in history — a moment where the international community has come together to agree on an ambitious framework to resolve some of the world’s most daunting challenges. Today, <strong>95% of plastic packaging</strong> material valued at over <strong>$100 billion annually</strong>, is lost to the economy after a short first use, pollute our nature, which will create huge problems for the future generation."" H. E. Mogens Lykketoft  <u>We want to contribute and change this!</u></p>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>We at <strong><a href=""https://www.opnplatform.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Open Packaging Network</a></strong> have built a new digital ecosystem for the packaging industry.  A <strong>Circular Economy Solution</strong> for both packaging manufacturers and brands across the globe. We have served more than <strong>800 companies</strong> to date.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to revise the whole packaging material lifecycle with a new initiative called<strong> <a href=""https://www.opnplatform.com/add-on"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FULL CYCLE</a>. </strong>A<strong> </strong>cutting-edge software that offers a revolutionary solution in the packaging waste management approach. Transform <u>packaging materials from a product into a service</u> and rethink the traditional life cycle of raw materials. Such an approach suggests the formation of a <u>new sharing economy within the packaging industry.</u> In which the manufacturer doesn’t sell packaging material definitely, but leases and then tracks the supply chain of its entire life cycle via sophisticated technology. </p>
<p><u>This is all possible thanks to accumulated experience, a skilled team and thorough data flow.</u></p>
<p>The <strong>FULL CYCLE</strong> innovative project moves the packaging industry into a positive spiral of value, stronger economics, and better environmental outcomes. In this way, manufacturers assume responsibilities for the reuse of waste and have an elevated interest in getting the after-use packaging materials back from consumers as a raw material for future production cycles.</p>
<p><strong>We invite you to invest with us on this timely opportunity.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We plan on raising an initial <strong>$815 000</strong> for the next 12 months of the development and implementation process. Backers deploy capital and contribute through donations inline with the <strong>UN’s Sustainable Development Goals</strong> and <u>becoming a catalyst for positive climate change and a new zero waste society.</u></p>
<p><u>Consumers will receive free access to a sophisticated web and mobile app</u> to allow <strong>FULL CYCLE</strong> to be successful. This will contribute positively to the planet and humankind in the long run. The platform will be based on a sustainable packaging waste management mechanism in which every participant of the packaging life cycle contributes to its <i>reuse in a circular, zero-waste production cycle. </i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Consumers</strong> may benefit from such an innovative system in many ways: </p>
<ul>
<li> Reduced price of products due to minimized materials costs</li>
<li> Eco-friendly involvement</li>
<li> Lesson carbon footprint by improving sustainability</li>
<li> Be a part of a revolutionary solution within the packaging manufacturing process</li>
<li>Tackle Climate Change</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manufacturers can benefit from:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Doing business responsibly</li>
<li>Accelerate transition to Circular Economy</li>
<li>Implement a zero-waste production cycle</li>
<li>Increase their use of sustainable materials in production of packaging</li>
<li>Connect with consumers via individualized packaging solutions</li>
</ul>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>The Process</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Consumer:</strong></p>
<p>Input requested data about the used packaging, based on location, into the <strong>FULL CYCLE</strong> system through scanned QR labels of businesses supporting the <strong>FULL CYCLE</strong> initiative. This contributes to full transparency of all packaging waste locations and stages of reuse in the circular economy. </p>
<p><strong>2. Manufacturers, Converters or Resellers</strong></p>
<p>Input data via unique identifiers in the <strong>FULL CYCLE</strong> system- packaging that remains immutable across all stages of the materials’ use and reuse. In this way, all manufacturers can track the location and condition of their materials via the <strong>FULL CYCLE </strong>app by using those unique identifiers. This system guarantees effective location of after-use packaging and prevention of its disposal into landfills or oceans.  </p>
<p><strong>3. Recycling Companies</strong></p>
<p>Register in the <strong>FULL CYCLE</strong> system to be added to the global map of facilities to ensure of recycled packaging waste. Gain access to deposits of packaging waste mapped by users in their location or become manufacturer service partner. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><strong>The Time Is NOW</strong></h2>
<p>Sustainable change doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a process of integration. We refer to this process as <strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong> and propose a new approach and action plan to get there. Now is the time for implementation. We must begin to practise what we have preached. Changing our production and consumption patterns in order to create virtuous cycles rather than depletive ones. Harnessing the global interconnectedness, communications technology and breakthroughs in materials science, we are now one step closer to a greener future!</p>

</div></div>","""We live in a defining moment in history — a moment where the international community has come together to agree on an ambitious framework to resolve some of the world’s most daunting challenges. Today, 95% of plastic packaging material valued at over $100 billion annually, is lost to the economy after a short first use, pollute our nature, which will create huge problems for the future generation."" H. E. Mogens Lykketoft  We want to contribute and change this!
Executive Summary
We at Open Packaging Network have built a new digital ecosystem for the packaging industry.  A Circular Economy Solution for both packaging manufacturers and brands across the globe. We have served more than 800 companies to date.
Now we are ready to revise the whole packaging material lifecycle with a new initiative called FULL CYCLE. A cutting-edge software that offers a revolutionary solution in the packaging waste management approach. Transform packaging materials from a product into a service and rethink the traditional life cycle of raw materials. Such an approach suggests the formation of a new sharing economy within the packaging industry. In which the manufacturer doesn’t sell packaging material definitely, but leases and then tracks the supply chain of its entire life cycle via sophisticated technology. 
This is all possible thanks to accumulated experience, a skilled team and thorough data flow.
The FULL CYCLE innovative project moves the packaging industry into a positive spiral of value, stronger economics, and better environmental outcomes. In this way, manufacturers assume responsibilities for the reuse of waste and have an elevated interest in getting the after-use packaging materials back from consumers as a raw material for future production cycles.
We invite you to invest with us on this timely opportunity.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We plan on raising an initial $815 000 for the next 12 months of the development and implementation process. Backers deploy capital and contribute through donations inline with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and becoming a catalyst for positive climate change and a new zero waste society.
Consumers will receive free access to a sophisticated web and mobile app to allow FULL CYCLE to be successful. This will contribute positively to the planet and humankind in the long run. The platform will be based on a sustainable packaging waste management mechanism in which every participant of the packaging life cycle contributes to its reuse in a circular, zero-waste production cycle. 
 
The Impact

Consumers may benefit from such an innovative system in many ways: 

 Reduced price of products due to minimized materials costs
 Eco-friendly involvement
 Lesson carbon footprint by improving sustainability
 Be a part of a revolutionary solution within the packaging manufacturing process
Tackle Climate Change

Manufacturers can benefit from:

Doing business responsibly
Accelerate transition to Circular Economy
Implement a zero-waste production cycle
Increase their use of sustainable materials in production of packaging
Connect with consumers via individualized packaging solutions

 
The Process
1. Consumer:
Input requested data about the used packaging, based on location, into the FULL CYCLE system through scanned QR labels of businesses supporting the FULL CYCLE initiative. This contributes to full transparency of all packaging waste locations and stages of reuse in the circular economy. 
2. Manufacturers, Converters or Resellers
Input data via unique identifiers in the FULL CYCLE system- packaging that remains immutable across all stages of the materials’ use and reuse. In this way, all manufacturers can track the location and condition of their materials via the FULL CYCLE app by using those unique identifiers. This system guarantees effective location of after-use packaging and prevention of its disposal into landfills or oceans.  
3. Recycling Companies
Register in the FULL CYCLE system to be added to the global map of facilities to ensure of recycled packaging waste. Gain access to deposits of packaging waste mapped by users in their location or become manufacturer service partner. 
 

The Time Is NOW
Sustainable change doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a process of integration. We refer to this process as Sustainable Development Goals and propose a new approach and action plan to get there. Now is the time for implementation. We must begin to practise what we have preached. Changing our production and consumption patterns in order to create virtuous cycles rather than depletive ones. Harnessing the global interconnectedness, communications technology and breakthroughs in materials science, we are now one step closer to a greener future!

<p>At TreeLife, we offset your carbon footprint through our uniquely devised strategy. Our platform allows you to purchase CO2 that will be permanently stored in trees, until the same amount of CO2 is offset by another renewable source. Unlike other tree planting organisations, we promise to <strong>indefinitely </strong>store the purchased amount of CO2. When a tree dies, it releases CO2 back into the environment . In this event, TreeLife plants a new tree in it's place; hence the CO2 allocated to a purchase will always be conserved. </p>
<p>A more detailed outline of our operation is described below: </p>
<p>i) Land Acquisition</p>
<p>The land is acquired directly and also by contracted leases with respective land owners. </p>
<p>The acquisition process is carried out by taking into consideration a number of factors, such as the conservation of natural habitats and indigenous species.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that some environmental companies may base their conservation services on plots of land which are already protected by government. At TreeLife we only work with land that is unprotected by such authorities, and hence, which is vulnerable to exploitation.  </p>
<p>ii) Planting trees </p>
<p>By employing local communities, not only will be doing something good for the environment but also creating local jobs.</p>
<p>Plant species will be dependent on the chemistry of the soil, the local climate and other environmental factors. However, we will only grow trees having long life spans and which are beneficial to the overall ecosystem (i.e. non-invasive).  We will also attempt to grow local species with a view to reclaiming forest and rain-forest land. </p>
<p>iii) Maintenance of the trees </p>
<p>Personnel from local communities will be hired to protect and maintain the trees, in order to ensure healthy growth and to allow wildlife to thrive.  </p>
<p>Our promise of storing the CO2 permanently will require replacement of dead trees. Hence the health and status of the tree will be moinitored on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Our scheme and operations are fully transparent, and we ensure this by means of the following actions:</p>
<p>a) We will open our sites to universities and research institutions in order to conduct any ecological and environmental research work or studies.</p>
<p>b) Every quarter, we will provide a quantitative statement showing the CO2 that has been stored in the trees grown. This will make it easy and straightforward for people to track the progress of the overall project.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our project is hugely valuable to the world because ecosystems are under threat, half of the world's biodiversity has been lost according to WWF in the past 40 years. The photographer, Dr Stanislav Shmelev has worked for the International Union for Conservation of Nature and proposed a new way to assess ecosystems and biodiversity using multi-criteria tools.  This book will illustrate the multiple dimensions of what ecosystems 'do', from oxygen production to water purification, production of food, generation of soils, carbon sequestration and pollination but also inspiration for artists and cultural and educational values.</p>
<p>Dr Stanislav Shmelev (<a href=""http://stanislav.photography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stanislav.photography</a>) is an award-winning photographer and ecological economist and has been leading Environment Europe since its foundation in 2004. He is the author and editor of bestselling books, 'Ecological Economics: Sustainability in Practice' (Springer, 2012): <a href=""https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9789400719712"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9789400719712</a> and 'Green Economy Reader' (Springer, 2017): <a href=""https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319389172"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319389172</a>. Dr Shmelev exhibited his photography in Austria, Dubai, Germany, Peru, Russia, Spain and the UK at venues, which include the United Nations, Global Landscapes Forum, Royal College of Art, Price Galitzine Library, Brighton Photo Biennial, Fotonoviembre de Tenerife, Format, St Ives Arts Club, Debut Contemporary, O3 Gallery etc.</p>
<p>The endorsements from the leading environmentalists the 'Ecosystems' photobook received already include:</p>
<p>“The great challenge of our time is to build and nurture human communities that honor, respect, and cooperate with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life. To do so, it is critical to understand how ecosystems work — not only intellectually, but also emotionally and spiritually. Artists have an essential role to play to foster such deep, multidimensional understanding, and Stanislav Shmelev’s magnificent book succeeds admirably in this task.” — Prof. Fritjof Capra, author, The Tao of Physics (1975), The Web of Life (1996), The Hidden Connections (2002), Learning from Leonardo (2007), coauthor, The Systems View of Life (2014).</p>
<p>“Our life depends on our ability to protect the home, which so generously hosts us. We should all contribute to our best. Sharing the captured moments of intrinsic beauty is certainly one of the most effective ways to raise awareness”, Janez Potočnik, former European Commissioner for the Environment, co-chair of the International Resources Panel, UN Environment.</p>
<p>“Stanislav Shmelev displays consummate skill in combining both art and science to produce his exquisite and captivating photo album, describing the essence of sustainability.” Prof. Mohan Munasinghe, Vice Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4), joint recipient of the 2007 Nobel Prize for Peace.</p>

<p>“It is essential for us to appreciate not only the beauty of Nature but also its critical life-support services to our planet and to all of its inhabitants. This book inspires us to a deeper understanding of our important responsibilities to protect, restore and nurture ecosystems so that they can continue to provide us with the comforts we cannot take for granted.”</p>

<p>“This is an outstanding collection of photographs. Stanislav’s wonderful and imaginative book and sensuous photographs show how the economy is entirely a subsidiary of the environment.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Shot in Colombia, Brazil, USA, Dubai, France, Spain, UK, Germany, Austria, Italy, Albania, Russia, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Malaysia and Singapore, this album speaks about the complexity, diversity and the true value of ecosystems. Professionally designed, this book will be published to the highest standard by the main partners of Thames and Hudson and Phaidon, National Geographic and Aperture.
Environment Europe is a sustainability think tank based in Oxford. It has been instrumental in providing cutting-edge research and education in sustainability, the programme of executive Summer and Winter Schools in Ecological Economics has been attended by participants from 54 different countries, including Canada, USA, Mexico, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, UK, France, Germany, Austria, Switzeland, Spain, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Albania, Latvia, Ghana, Nigeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, China, India, Bhutan, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, Australia and New Zealand. The participants of our programmes included representatives of UNEP, UNDP, ILO, WWF, OECD, IUCN, European Commission, GGGI, GIZ, government departments, companies and leading universities.
We are aiming to raise £10000 to allow our audience to pre-order 'ECOSYSTEMS', a beautiful coffee-table photo album that will communicate the beauty, unique functions and diversity of world's ecosystems and illustrate a simple idea that we entirely depend on the ecosystems and the natural world and that money cannot be a measuring rod to assess its value..
The book has already been produced and a tall white ship will bring the first 500 copies to the UK in five weeks time. It is already listed on Amazon: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ecosystems-Complexity-diversity-contribution-humanity/dp/1999624106

What We Need & What You Get
The £10000 we seek will go towards covering the cost of producing the first 500 copies of the album, many of which will be distributed in universities, libraries and NGOs all around the world.

The Impact
Our project is hugely valuable to the world because ecosystems are under threat, half of the world's biodiversity has been lost according to WWF in the past 40 years. The photographer, Dr Stanislav Shmelev has worked for the International Union for Conservation of Nature and proposed a new way to assess ecosystems and biodiversity using multi-criteria tools.  This book will illustrate the multiple dimensions of what ecosystems 'do', from oxygen production to water purification, production of food, generation of soils, carbon sequestration and pollination but also inspiration for artists and cultural and educational values.
Dr Stanislav Shmelev (stanislav.photography) is an award-winning photographer and ecological economist and has been leading Environment Europe since its foundation in 2004. He is the author and editor of bestselling books, 'Ecological Economics: Sustainability in Practice' (Springer, 2012): https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9789400719712 and 'Green Economy Reader' (Springer, 2017): https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319389172. Dr Shmelev exhibited his photography in Austria, Dubai, Germany, Peru, Russia, Spain and the UK at venues, which include the United Nations, Global Landscapes Forum, Royal College of Art, Price Galitzine Library, Brighton Photo Biennial, Fotonoviembre de Tenerife, Format, St Ives Arts Club, Debut Contemporary, O3 Gallery etc.
The endorsements from the leading environmentalists the 'Ecosystems' photobook received already include:
“The great challenge of our time is to build and nurture human communities that honor, respect, and cooperate with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life. To do so, it is critical to understand how ecosystems work — not only intellectually, but also emotionally and spiritually. Artists have an essential role to play to foster such deep, multidimensional understanding, and Stanislav Shmelev’s magnificent book succeeds admirably in this task.” — Prof. Fritjof Capra, author, The Tao of Physics (1975), The Web of Life (1996), The Hidden Connections (2002), Learning from Leonardo (2007), coauthor, The Systems View of Life (2014).
“Our life depends on our ability to protect the home, which so generously hosts us. We should all contribute to our best. Sharing the captured moments of intrinsic beauty is certainly one of the most effective ways to raise awareness”, Janez Potočnik, former European Commissioner for the Environment, co-chair of the International Resources Panel, UN Environment.
“Stanislav Shmelev displays consummate skill in combining both art and science to produce his exquisite and captivating photo album, describing the essence of sustainability.” Prof. Mohan Munasinghe, Vice Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR4), joint recipient of the 2007 Nobel Prize for Peace.

“It is essential for us to appreciate not only the beauty of Nature but also its critical life-support services to our planet and to all of its inhabitants. This book inspires us to a deeper understanding of our important responsibilities to protect, restore and nurture ecosystems so that they can continue to provide us with the comforts we cannot take for granted.”

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are working to revitalize a neglected piece of property into a state of the art Eco friendly recycling center.  Garbage is one of the biggest contributors to pollution worldwide and we are on a mission to develop a facility dedicated 100% to recycling various materials.  We have the property and all required permits already which are the hard part.  Big problem is the facility was leased to a company that went into bankruptcy and left the site full of their debris.  Plan is to revitalize the property and roll out different processes for recycling of various materials. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are working towards cleaning the facility as well as catching up on property taxes to create a full cycle green Eco friendly recycling facility. In addition to those two major reasons for the campaign we will do our part to find ways to reuse every items we have coming into the facility.  Our first major development plan will be equipment that can recycle asphalt shingles and tires.  </p>

What I offer in exchange is more than money, I am inviting you to witness and be on this journey with me, you will have the opportunity to dive into the process of transformation and spiritual development in community living, as well as become part of raising awareness internationally about the importance of preserving the indigenous communities that are under threat.</p><p>I am deeply grateful to the experiences that led to this project, they opened me to the world as a whole and offered me prodigious sense of belonging to humanity rather than one geographical region. I found myself useful to serve humankind and the earth in such ways that I could find meaning and inspiration. Therefore, I feel a profound need to give back whilst discovering the ancient indigenous knowledge with therapeutic potential of shamanic diets and master healers.  I am offering my skill, experience, outreach and most importantly myself as a research subject. The research will start in the November of 2019 and will potentially continue for 18 months. </p><p>With the community permissions am going to develop a thorough on-line presence of my project through daily live updates from the community life on<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/healing_amazon/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Instagram</a>, as well as keep a detailed diary<a href=""https://florestasagrada201.wixsite.com/healingamazon"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> blog</a>, both of these will become the main resource for my research and are currently under construction.

What I offer in exchange is more than money, I am inviting you to witness and be on this journey with me, you will have the opportunity to dive into the process of transformation and spiritual development in community living, as well as become part of raising awareness internationally about the importance of preserving the indigenous communities that are under threat.I am deeply grateful to the experiences that led to this project, they opened me to the world as a whole and offered me prodigious sense of belonging to humanity rather than one geographical region. I found myself useful to serve humankind and the earth in such ways that I could find meaning and inspiration. Therefore, I feel a profound need to give back whilst discovering the ancient indigenous knowledge with therapeutic potential of shamanic diets and master healers.  I am offering my skill, experience, outreach and most importantly myself as a research subject. The research will start in the November of 2019 and will potentially continue for 18 months. With the community permissions am going to develop a thorough on-line presence of my project through daily live updates from the community life on Instagram, as well as keep a detailed diary blog, both of these will become the main resource for my research and are currently under construction. Yet the most exciting product is series of short documentaries, that I am planning to work on the go. I will be able to talk about community benefit more when I find hosts and have a change to understand what they need from their perspective as well.The budget for the trip is around $8,000 USD see the cost breakdown below (not including Indiegogo fees), the trip will be built depending on the raised amount. ANY FUNDS RAISED ON TOP OF THIS, WILL BE DONATED DIRECTLY BACK TO THE COMMUNITY NEEDS.Read more about the struggles of indigenous people in Amazon.***Hi all!

Inserting the Andean Condor in its original habitat in central South America. Agricultural and livestock educate people about the importance of sustaining this new population.

Generate a sustainable space for species and biodiversity that contributes to economic activities.


Because Donate?The Andean Condor is in serious danger of extinction. Whole populations have disappeared. In the center of Argentina, in South America, specifically in the province of Cordoba, its habitat has been greatly reduced.Erroneously for years, farmers and ranchers fought this animal considering it a threat to their livestock. Today it was found that their presence is vital for biological control because it feeds on the main carriers of the virus Anta rodents and other animals that damage crops.Our IdeaFirst Stage:

Acquiring a field in Villa Berna, Córdoba, Argentina, to build a breeding farm and insertion of CONDOR in the Calamuchita valley at the foot of the hill Champaqui, the highest of the shut Cordoba.


The center will have a set of incubators for breeding and feeding puppets of the hatchlings (no contact with man).

  

A school to chat and information about the importance of the Condor open to the community and educational institutions.

<p><b>Inspiration</b></p>
<p>As pet lovers, visiting the pet spa was once our weekly routine.
However, it was a hassle to make appointments, commute (often in traffic), and
wait around. We then tried grooming our pets at home with the existing scissors
and electric clippers on the market. It was challenging for us as non-pros, not
to mention the mess left behind. We thought, what about a vacuum-powered
clipper that sucks in all the hair while trimming? We searched, and what we
found were that the vacuum grooming tools already on the market were all heavy,
inflexible, imprecise, and too noisy for our pets. Could we produce something
better ourselves?</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468672305/Milestones-tu0_2_ovzy28.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></b></p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Development</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Starting in 2013, we brought together a group of talented designers and engineers to reinvent the in-home pet grooming experience. At first, we tried to integrate a vacuum with a few existing grooming attachments but we still struggled with the weight and comfort of the tool as well as experiencing poor grooming results. </p>
<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468672319/Milestones-tu4_1_virknp.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In October 2014, inspired by nature, we considered tapping into wind
power. By using wind as a single power source, the grooming attachment might
not need a second motor. We studied the turbo engine and developed a turbo
wind-driven motor that weighs only 0.09lb, which turned out to be a vital
breakthrough! Our new-patented air-touch technology not only reduced the overall
product weight by 30%, but also led to more flexibility and accuracy in
trimming.</span><br/></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><b>Iteration</b></p>
<p>During the next 18 months, GroomPal continued to evolve, expanding the canister capacity with dust compression and improving the filtering
system. By June 2016 we were already making our 5th prototype whose appearance
closely resembles our current product. It’s by far our lightest version, with the
highest cleaning rate and largest canister capacity. Outperforming all

<br/>
<h2><b><span>FAQ</span></b></h2>
<p><b>1.  How long does the GroomPal last?</b></p>
<p>After many rounds of testing, most parts of the current
GroomPal prototype function up to 800 hours, while the trimming attachment
lasts 500 hours. On average, if used an hour every week at home, it will
continue to work well for 7-8 years. </p>
<p><b>2.  My pet doesn't like loud sounds. How is the noise level of the GroomPal?</b></p>
<p>We specifically designed the GroomPal for the comfort of our pets, who often got nervous about grooming at pet spas and vet appointments. Because the motor is situated in the canister and designed to be quieter, it makes a pleasant experience for the pet. We have tested it on hundreds of pets, and as you can see from our videos and pictures, the pets were quite relaxed during the grooming process.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3.  What is the trimming blade made of? How do I maintain it?</b></p>
<p>The blade is made of durable high-carbon steel. The material is temperature resistant but we have also designed a unique cool airflow system for peak performance. We suggest applying professional lubricant regularly to prevent dullness and jamming. The blade may get dull every 5-6 sessions. We have included at least one set of 3 replacement blades in each package that’s good for over one-year of usage. You can purchase replacement blades separately on our website after the Indiegogo campaign. We will keep you posted once they become available.</p>
<p><b>4. Can I purchase
the attachments separately and attach them directly to my vacuum machine at
home?</b></p>
<p>We currently do not sell attachments separately. With its
unique air-touch technology, the GroomPal vacuum device has been optimized over
time for the smoothest operation of all attachments. Using these attachments
with other branded vacuum devices may damage the attachments or affect the
parts’ longevity. However, for users who own a 500-800W powered vacuum with
speed control, GroomPal’s attachments will perform relatively well on this type
of vacuum device. The attachments may be sold separately in the future and we
will keep you updated with further information on our website.</p>
<p><b>5.  
How does the hair straightening technology work?</b></p>
<p>The ""hair-straightening"" technology has gone
through extensive testing and upgrading. It doesn’t pull the hair at all,
instead gently straightening it for an even cut. When you use it for the very
first time, please start with the lowest speed and increase the speed gradually
as you become comfortable. The suction uses a unique trapezium-shaped design,
and doesn't jam if used properly.</p>
<p><b>6.  Does the
one-year warranty cover anywhere in the world? How do you define “used as
intended”? Where is your repair center?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the warranty covers global purchases. Within one
year of the purchase, if used as intended, any breakage or quality issue arises, you can send it
back for free repair or part replacement. The user will only need to pay the
shipping fee. The warranty doesn't cover the blade, as it will naturally wear
out during normal usage.</p>
<p>Not using as “intended’ examples can include:</p>
<p>• Dropping or hitting the attachments when they are
operating</p>
<p>• Continuously operating the device at the highest
speed for more than 2 hours straight</p>
<p>• Frequent use in a professional spa, including
resulting damage of the carbon brush or gears of the turbo engine</p>
<p>Our repair center is located in China. </p>
<p><b>7.  Can GroomPal be
used on cats or people?</b></p>
<p>Yes, but the hair diameter needs to be less than 0.15mm.
Within the next few months on our social media channels we will share more
videos about grooming cats properly and examples of use on kids and adults.
Stay tuned.</p>
<p><b>8.  Can I trim my
pet if its hair is tangled badly?</b></p>
<p>You should brush its hair first with the included brush
attachment. If the hair is tangled from the roots, and is difficult to brush
through, we suggest cutting off the tangles/knots first without any combs.
Afterwards, you can attach combs of the desired length to the clipper for a
stylish hair cut. </p>
<p><b>9. Is GroomPal patented?</b></p>
<p>We already have a registered utility model patent and three
pending patents on the technology as well as a pending global PCT patent.</p>
<p><b>10. How do you ensure GroomPal's high </b><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>manufacturing quality?</b></span></p>
<p>Our manufacturing director has 15 years experience in
hardware development, manufacturing, and design. We’ve selected one of the best
manufacturing partners, experienced in working with established brands such as
Shark, Karcher, and Hoover. This partnership will ensure GroomPal is
manufactured at a very high quality.</p>
<p><b>11. Has GroomPal obtained any safety certifications?</b></p>
<p>The product has passed tests on hundreds of pets with
different coat types and lengths. Not one potential safety issue has ever been
detected. The only precaution owners need to take is not to use the blades
within the pet’s skin folds. The product has been submitted for North American
65 and European RoHS certifications, which we expect to have by September 2016.</p>

Llegar a acuerdos con la administración pública para la gestión de los puntos de aportación y de recogida selectiva y dar una segunda vida a los plásticos recogidos, evitando así posibles quemas de plásticos y contaminación ambiental.Nuestro sistema consiste en:Recogida y recepción de plásticos en nuestro almacén.Triturado y desecado de plásticos.Impresión de plásticos con nuestras impresoras 3D.Venta posterior de  estos productos a nivel nacional:- Mobiliario de interiores y exteriores económicos- Material de construcción para viviendas económicas y sostenibles- Venta de plásticos en forma de pellets para la industria.Una medida que la empresa crezca, la parte mayor de los recursos económicos va a ir destinada a la creación de nuevos puntos de recogida e impresión a lo largo de todo el territorio nacional.En este sentido, creemos que es una empresa con una gran capacidad de crecimiento ofreciendo como resultados, nuevos lugares de trabajo (transportes, recogida y separación de plásticos, impresores, diseñadores 3D...), que colaboran con asociaciones locales y ayuntamientos, para conseguir reutilizar plásticos que de otra forma resultan en muchos, muy contaminantes contaminantes contaminantesNecesitamos ayuda para poner en marcha el proyecto.Ya contamos con almacén, máquinas de impresión y furgoneta para recogida, también hemos empezado una ronda de contactos con diferentes alcaldes de la zona y podemos decir que en general, el proyecto cuenta con la simpatía y el apoyo de mucha gente, pero no es suficiente. Necesitamos adquirir varias máquinas para que la empresa empiece a funcionar.Una trituradora de plásticos de capacidad industrial cuyo coste es de 3.000 euros.Una máquina para hacer filamentos: 6.000 euros.4 Extrusoras de Pellets: 2200 euros.Contenedores para puntos de aportación: 80 euros cada uno.Campaña publicitaria: 2.000 euros.Actualmente somos 2 personas trabajando, pero si va bien, necesitaremos a:1 Conductor para traslado plásticos.1 Recolector, triturador.1 Técnico de Impresoras 3D.1 Diseñador 3D.Esta seria la plantilla media por municipio de 6000 a 10000 habitantes.Ecofilament, se compromete a mantener la información de forma clara y transparente a todos los interesados a través de nuestra página web, aún en construcción.Llevamos tiempo estudiando las posibilidades de la impresión 3D.

<p>The inception of Project Eco Earth can be traced back to when we were walking through one of the famous nature trails of Uttarakhand, India. We identified the problem of how those areas are not at all able to manage the plastic being generated by the tourists. Almost all the plastic waste is either disposed of in drains or is burnt away. We went on to other trails and found large heaps of plastics being dumped in every corner of the mountains.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The issues revolving around plastic waste have long been acknowledged. However, the efforts made to combat it have been minimal. While the rates of plastic consumption are rising alarmingly, developments in its waste management have not picked up. It is well known that once introduced into the environment, plastic is capable of staying in the system for over 500 years. Before degrading entirely, plastic disintegrates into tiny particles that have hazardous impacts. According to UN estimates India generates about 15,342 tons of plastic waste per day (TPD) if we talk particularly in the tourism circuits of Uttarakhand the number. Even when statistics state that India recycles 60% of its plastic, a major chunk of plastic waste in the oceans comes from India. Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in our country. More tourists equal more waste, and more waste inevitably translates into a larger environmental footprint. This is not just a problem for the areas where establishing an efficient waste management system is challenging, like small islands or remote, sparsely populated areas. Even major tourist sites fail to pay heed to this alarming issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This plastic waste is capable of traveling hundreds of kilometers, getting lodged into the ecosystem, leeching out chemicals that affect every possible life form. Many studies have investigated the potential uptake of hydrophobic contaminants emerging from mismanaged plastic waste, which then get bioaccumulated in the food chain. Plastic is made using toxic additives like BPA, BPS, and Phthalates which can easily dissolve out into whatever material is kept inside it. Scientists have studied and illustrated how this can serious health defects like thyroid, mental breakdown, bad stomach, cell disruptions, DNA mutation and even higher stages of cancer. The harmful chemicals like PCBs, DDT, and PAH, which get absorbed in the plastic debris that floats in the sea water, have a varied and harmful range of chronic effects like endocrine disorders. The plastic that flows out in water bodies gets ingested by marine life forms exposing them to dangers of either poisoning or choking. Besides this, waste dump sites attract animals which feed on the easily available food waste and in the process, ingest the plastic interspersed with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A lot of single-use plastic is thrown in the tourism circuits and due to lack of resources and ideas on how to deal with it, therefore, it either ends up in the rivers, chokes nallahs, litter around the trails or just lies somewhere in the corner of the mountains. Project Eco Earth is an environment-friendly solution to tackle the plastic problem around the globe by introducing easy to handle portable and efficient machines to up-cycle plastic and develop products which can be used for a long duration. As previously stated, we are going to develop a set of four machines namely Shredder, Extrusion, Injector, and Compressor. The shredded plastic flakes go into the extrusion machine to create threads of plastic which directly can be used to make door handles, vases, baskets, etc. Similarly, the injector gives out the melted plastic directly inside small molds to make small products like wall tiles. The compressor is a device which comes in the picture when we need to create big products like chairs, buckets, sheets, bricks, etc.</p>
<p>The main Goals and Objectives of this project, therefore, are -</p>
<p>• Reduce Plastic in the urban and rural landfills, mainly starting with tourist hotspots</p>
<p>• Create sustainable material from the plastic waste collected</p>
<p>• Promote DIY machines to set micro entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>• Create employment</p>
<p>The Machines are uniquely designed by our team throughout the globe to fit in a small workspace in order to be easy to handle, maintain and deliver the most efficient outcomes, before starting with the machine handling it should be very clear of what type of plastic we are going to deal with and whether it is pre segregated or not so that we can keep the products categorically as every category of plastic melts at a different temperature and if not understood properly can cause serious damage to the machine as well as will degrade the quality of the outcome.</p>
<p>The Shredder is designed in such a way that it can shred even the hardest plastic with a motor of 3Hp and 70 RPM, it goes slow and steady and gives equal pressure at every blade to a perfect same sized flakes of plastic the pain is to get used to segregate plastic categorically and use only one at a time the idea is to keep all the categories segregated so that in future the products can again be recycled and keep up the vicious circle.</p>
<p>Now these flakes enters the Extrusion machine where these shredded plastic flakes takes a new shape all together the machine is basically a heating tube with a 1.5 Hp motor connected at 60-70 RPM .once the temperature reaches the melting point of a particular category of plastic ,the flakes of the same categories goes inside the machine and keeps throwing a thread of the same material which either can be rolled in a thread form, or cut continuously at an interval to get pallets of the category which can be used as a secondary virgin material and molded into other shapes and forms . This machine is also capable of creating rod-like the structure of various shapes and castes you want to and have a nozzle to decide what shape coming out of the tube and of course the dimension of it.</p>
<p>These pallets now can be used to put into the third machine i.e. Injection machine which is small similar heating tube machine as that of the Extrusion but doesn’t have a motor (its manual) and also is standing vertical, pointing downwards which once preheated to a certain temperature it intakes the pallets into its semi funnel fitted in the rod and goes straight into the tube, a mould is already fixed in the nozzle and is waiting to be injected, the melted plastic then pushed and pooped into the cast to take desired shapes. This machine can process only a limited quantity and that is the reason why we can only make small products out of this machine and for big products we use a compressor.</p>
<p>The Compressor creates products like baskets, tubs, vases, big tiles etc. The machine is a uniquely finished design which is fitted with an oven at the top of it with a small circular hole at the floor of the oven and a solid 5mm steel sheet at the ceiling inside, once a cast of product filled with flakes/ pallets enters into the oven chamber its is pushed from below wising a mechanical jack manually and given the shape provided the oven was preheated and was set to a temperature already.</p>
<p>All the machines are equipped with temperature controllers where heating takes place and speed regulator where the motor runs sometimes both using PID controllers and latest temperature regulators, in the shredder there exists a controller device which sometimes allows the motor to automatically reverse the shredding if stuck with a thick plastic piece.</p>

</ul><p> </p></div>","WE NEED YOUR SUPPORTEach purchase of an OCEANPLASTIK perk contributes to the development of an innovating ecosystem to cleanup and recycle (ocean) plastic debris on a global scale.With your support we can start to develop this ecosystem to battle the global plastic pollution problem by cleaning up and recycling as many plastic as possible.All our backers will be listed on our website.Our main target is to give collected and recycled plastic waste a real value and reward all participants using their smartphone.OCEANPLASTIK aims to cleanup and recycle approximately 19,500,000 kilos of (ocean) plastic waste through its ecosystem in the next 4 years.In April 2020 we expect to have the OCEANPLASTIK ecosystem live, including a recycling, production center and a network of waste collection points in Bali (Indonesia) before we expand to other regions around the world.We need to cleanup our beautiful planet from the insane amount of plastic waste we have created before its too late. Our children's children deserve a future! LOCALIZE AND CLEANUP PLASTIC OCEANPLASTIK empowers you and everyone else with a smartphone to combat (ocean) plastic debris using PTAGGER, a mobile app (Android and iOS) to tag, localize and collect plastic waste.From April 2020 everyone can download the PTAGGER app and earn exchangeable crypto tokens by tagging, collecting and dropping off plastic waste at connected waste collection points and recycling centers. FEATURES
Easy-to-use interface
Localization (available in multiple languages)
Tag, collect and drop off plastic objects
Navigational instructions (Google Maps Platform API)
Real-time collection queue
Notification services
Using QR codes for drop off activities
App users are rewarded with crypto tokens
Levels, scores and achievements (gamification elements)
Social media functions (profile, timeline, activity feed, follow and albums)
Education aspects (create awareness and learn more about plastic)
Issue crypto debit cards for PTAGGER app users
 FUTURE ADD-ONS
Automated drone solution to collect tagged plastic that is ready to be picked up
Smart trash bin solution to increase the number of waste collection points within the OP ecosystem
 Note:With the PTAGGER app we aim engage local communities and motivate millions of people.For example many people in Indonesia (and other countries) have a smartphone with Internet access but have a lack of income.We aim to give all our app users a safe and secure source of income by cleaning up plastic waste (tag, collect and drop off plastic objects).By installing the PTAGGER app, our users (locals) are automatically notified if someone in their area has tagged plastic waste that is ready to be collected and dropped off.We expect this method will engage millions of people to be part of the ecosystem and doing their contribution to cleanup (ocean) plastic waste. In the next 4 years we aim to have 13,5 million active PTAGGER app users and 2,250 collection points, where our users can drop off collected plastic waste. RECYCLED PLASTICCollected plastic waste will be processed at one of the connected recycling centers.Recycling companies can enlist their batches of recycled plastic on RPNDEX, a decentralized marketplace for recycled plastic where plastic manufacturers can get their production material for the lowest prices.This way we encourage plastic manufacturers to avoid using virgin plastic resin for their production purposes and purchase recycled plastics.Both plastic recycling companies and manufacturers can use specific B2B features within the RPNDEX marketplace to accelerate their business activities. NEW ENDURABLE PRODUCTSOCEANPLASTIK will set up collection points, recycling and production centers in areas that are heavily affected by plastic pollution to manufacture new endurable plastic products.By manufacturing endurable plastic chopsticks made out of ocean plastic debris we aim to minimize deforestation with an alternative for disposable wooden chopsticks.Later we will manufacture other endurable products using recycled plastic like cutlery, building bricks, lunchboxes (for children) and additional semi-finished products for our partners.OP products will be sold over various sales channels including our own B2C - B2B webshop and promoted using our affiliate program (for resellers). OCEANPLASTIK will use its generated sales profits as followed:
To increase the cleanup and recycle process
To create awareness about the global plastic pollution problem
To educate people about plastic pollution
Create job opportunities
Involve local economies and governments
Buy back crypto tokens from the crypto exchanges

<p>Nambiti is situated in a malaria-free zone - so there's no need for medication. It is also the only reserve in the area that can boast of having the Big 5, along with 40 other game species. Nambiti's 22000 acres offers incredible biodiversity, with grasslands, riverine bush, savannah and thornveld. Game viewing, birding, and fishng (for yellowtail) in the river are the main activities at Nambiti, which is also close to the renowned battlefields.</p>
<p>""Conservation has to be a business. It can't run on fluffy stuff; it has to run on real things.""</p>
<p>There are nine game lodges, with facilities ranging from self catering to the pampered. Our Lodge will be the tenth and final Safari  lodge on Nambiti, which will boast 5 star service. </p>
<p>The long-term goal of our Bush Lodge is creating a differentiated experience capitalising on personal service, the historical nature of Nambiti, and its unique location in one of the most attractive parts of South Africa. We plan to be more than a great lodge. We plan to create an environment of pampered luxury that surpasses the standard.  A place where you can leave the stresses and worries of everyday life behind you and allow the magic of the bush to captivate your soul. Introducing the Lodge to people that have not yet discovered this year-round paradise will allow us to maintain a higher than average occupancy rate and above average profits. A new bush lodge is a perfect symbiosis of wildlife conservation by raising international awareness, creating jobs for the local people and maintaining a safe sanctuary for the animals. Since the reserve was founded it created over 400 jobs for the local community and is now home to hundreds of animals. Our lodge will create 15 more sustainable jobs for the local community and through the payment of levies to the reserve will contribute towards conservation and protection of these magnificent animals. </p>
<p>Our Lodge will exude a warm, welcoming atmosphere that invites guests to submit to the magic of the African bush. Visitors will accommodated one of only 5 exclusive, free standing  suites, offering maximum privacy each with it's own splash pool and spectacular views of the bushveld.  After a game drive, visitors can enjoy a massage or take a dip in the magnificent infinity pool. Meals will be prepared to perfection by a new Executive Chef and are served in the traditional boma or in the elegantly decorated dining room. The lodge will have four Luxury Suites with one Honeymoon Suite each having it's own unique theme and design. Suites will consist of  a plush bedroom with a walk-in cupboard and spacious lounge area. The open-plan bathrooms will house a feature bath that invites long indulgent soaks. There are 'His' and 'Hers' showers in both the bathroom as well as outdoors for an added touch of magic under the African sky. Glass folding doors invite the bush to be the main focus of the lodge. We will use natural, eco friendly and recycled materials to reduce the environmental footprint without compromising on the quality. We want our guests to feel pampered and homely at the same time. We will create a space that will allow you to escape the rat race, take off your shoes and immerse yourself fully in the magic of Africa.</p>

<p>The number of rhinos poached in South Africa in 2017 was lower than 2016’s. Last year, 1028 rhinos were killed compared to 1054 in 2016, a decrease of 26 animals (2.5%). </p>
<p>Any fall in the numbers is welcomed, but it’s the fifth year running that over 1000 rhinos were killed.</p>
<p>TRAFFIC, the international wildlife trade monitoring group, states that 5476 rhinos were killed in South Africa over a five year period. This is from an estimated rhino populations at the end of 2010 of 18 796 white and 1916 black rhino in the country. South Africa has about 93% of the world’s white rhino population and 40% of its black rhinos.</p>
<p>Though recorded deaths have dropped for three years in a row, there is still a crisis on hand. Tom Milliken, TRAFFIC’s Rhino Programme Leader, said</p>

<p>Anti-poaching operations in the world famous Kruger National Park have achieved considerable success. But rhino poaching has soared in KwaZulu-Natal and several other provinces. The Kruger has increased patrols, the size and sophistication of anti-poaching units and worked with the South African army to secure the areas with the largest rhino populations, but smaller parks and reserves do not have the resources to do this.</p>
<p>Your pledge will directly help to fight poaching though our monthly donation to the reserve which will help to maintain anti poaching team on the reserve. </p>

<p>Both Nadia and myself are nature lovers, South Africa and Nambiti especially has captured our hearts. We believe that through small acts of kindness you can accomplish great change, and the time to give back and preserve this planet is now.</p>
<p>We both worked in hospitality and corporate environment as well as ran successful businesses. Each time we went to Nambiti we realised that we never want to leave.

<p>It is time to make a difference. Now you can show that you care. This is the chance to DO something. Everybody can afford to buy a tree. Do it NOW and share it with the wold.</p>
<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">How it works</span></h3>The business model is very
simple and transparent. You can buy a share of the company that owns the forest. You'll get all the documents such as a share certificate, company
titles, and GPS coordinates of your tree/s.  The
Australian legal system guarantees long term safety of the forest and your
investment.</span></div>
<div>
<p>As a non-for-profit company we would also guarantee by our company constitution to reinvest any
surplus into reforestation. </p>
<p>The best thing is that you get immediate value for your investment. If the campaign is successful (= $250 000 AUD invested), you own the trees which you have already paid for. If not, you'll <b>get your money back</b>. This is how we want to set up the project.</p>
<p>We are very excited about our project, because this has never been done on a global basis before.  We could create a public market for<b> living</b> trees and that would help our environment tremendously.</p>

<p>According to a study (<a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2013/11/14/342.6160.850.DC1/Hansen.SM.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2013/11...</a>) based on Google Earth we have estimated that there are only 100 trees to each human on this planet left today. With our project you can buy one of these trees for as little as $25. You would get 25 sqm of forest with a guaranteed minimum of 1 tree on it. With an investment of as little as $2500 you can secure enough trees for a lifetime supply of oxygen for yourself.</p>

<h3>Perks</h3>
<h4>1. $25AUD one living tree</h4>
<p>You'll get a share certificate and GPS coordinates of the tree. You'll be a proud owner of a living tree, that cannot be cut.</p>
<h4>2. $250AUD ten living trees</h4>
<p>You'll get ten share certificates and GPS coordinates of the trees. You'll be a proud owner of a tiny living forest that cannot be cleared. You would also get a preview of the tree allocation map and a photo of your trees. </p>
<h4>3. $2500AUD hundred living trees</h4>
<p>You'll get one hundred share certificates and GPS coordinates of the trees. You'll be a proud owner of a small living forest that cannot be cleared. You would also get a preview of the tree allocation map and a photo of your trees. If you want to visit your forest, we can organize free entry to the property/forest.</p>
<p>During this visit, you would have the option to place an ownership stone in the middle of your trees with your name carved onto it. It would also say, that you bought those trees in order to protect them. This stone will be placed with the intent to keep it standing for many many generations to come.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Where the money goes</h3>
<p>You buy a share of the company. This money will go into buying forests, maintaining forests, reforesting, and company administration. The company, by its constitution, will assign one tree to all shares released by the company.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Your return on investment</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Since 1993 we are observing Australian forest pricing. A forest worth $17,000AUD in 1993 is worth today $115,000AUD. If
you compare with interest rates today, or the share market even, this is an incredible
return of 9.5% per year! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/894974/files/20140930220221-Investment.JPG?1412139741"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With taxes on carbon emission coming soon worldwide, forest
owners will get money for their oxygen production. Hence the prices for forests
will rise. So next year you can expect the share price for one tree to be $27
already.</p>
<p>As it stands, this investment could be an excellent addition to a retirement fund for job starters. Keep buying one tree each week and you have saved over $200,000 after 30 years. (providing value for trees goes up by 9.5% each year)</p>

<div>The constitution of the company would guarantee to reinvest any surplus into reforestation and buying forests. It would also state that any trees which get destroyed by natural forces (flood, diseases, ...) will be replaced with other trees at a new location (so you will never loose your trees). The company will cover all costs of maintaining the forests, and keep extending the assets of the company by buying new forests (<a href=""http://www.abetterperspective.com.au/BuyTrees/Budget-Goals.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">business plan</a>).

<h3>The Founder</h3>
<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Walter Gith. I was born in Germany and living in Australia now. I studied physics in Germany. After starting an IT career with a consulting company I later worked as a manager in a large corporation for 10 years. For 14 years now, I have been running a small software company in Australia. For as long as I remember I loved trees.

</div>
<h4>Can I pay with credit or debit card?</h4>
<div><p>Yes,
first select ‚Pay with PayPal‘. Then there is an option ‘Pay with a credit or debit
card’. After you entered the Card details, you will be asked to use the
details to open a PayPal account. But in the same window there is a button that
allows you to “Continue’ without creating a PayPal account. Choose this option.  </p></div>
<h4>Can I contribute any amount?</h4>
<div>Yes, you don't need to choose a PERK. Any contribution amount that is a multiple of $25AUD will be used to issue shares and attracts the benefits of a $25 PERK. If you contribute $250AUD we will automatically handle this as PERK 2 (accordingly for $2500AUD).   </div>
<div>For obvious reasons please choose multiples of $25 as your contribution/payment amount.</div>
<h4>Can I sell, donate, bequeath or give away the share?</h4>
<div>Yes. An ownership change request will be necessary. The company register change causes a fee. If you want to give away the share as a present, just put the receivers email address in the first email box that comes up.</div>
<h4>Is this campaign restricted to Australia? </h4>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">No, this is a worldwide campaign. Everybody in the world is allowed to buy company shares. There is also a German translation of this page further down. Many browsers like Chrome also provide a 'translate page' feature.</span></p>
<h4>How is the relation between tree and share?</h4>
<p>You can only buy a living tree (we are not talking about trees form nurseries), if you own the land where it is on. The company buys the land with the trees on it. The share represents the part of the company that equals 25 sqm. The company guarantees by its constitution that there is a minimum of one tree per 25 sqm (this could be verified for you through Google earth).</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Where would the forest be bought?</h4>We will start in Australia. Other regions could follow as the company grows.</div><div>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What is in it for the founder?</span><br/>
</div><div>
<div>The founder is happy that forest is saved. But in case of success he also gets a salary for the administration work. The company's financial reports will be sent to all shareholders.</div>
<h4>When the campaign fails, would I get the whole $25AUD back?</h4>
<div>YES</div>
<h4>What is INDIEGOGO?</h4>
<div>It is a crowd-funding platform: Many small single contributors together make an investment in a company. Often is the investment lost. Not in our case. The company would only be founded if the critical sum of $250000 investment is reached. If it is not reached, all participants will get their money back, which is guaranteed by Indiegogo (fixed funding). If reached, everybody gets a share with tree rights attached.</div>

<h3>Leistungen (PERKS)</h3>
<h4>1. $25AUD ein lebendiger Baum</h4>
<p>Du bekommst ein Aktienzertifikat und die GPS Koordinaten von Deinem Baum. Dann bist Du ein stolzer Besitzer eines lebendigen Baumes, der nicht gefällt werden kann.</p>
<h4>2. $250AUD zehn lebendige Bäume</h4>
<p>Du bekommst ein Aktienzertifikat und die GPS Koordinaten von Deinen Bäumen. Dann bist Du ein stolzer Besitzer eines kleinen Waldes, der nicht gerodet werden kann. Du bekommst auch vorab eine Karte mit der Position deiner Bäume und ein Photo. </p>
<h4>3. $2500AUD hundert lebendige Bäume</h4>
<p>Du bekommst ein Aktienzertifikat und die GPS Koordinaten von Deinem Baum. Dann bist Du ein stolzer Besitzer eines kleinen Waldes, der nicht gerodet werden kann. Du bekommst auch vorab eine Karte mit der Position deiner Bäume und ein Photo. Wenn Du deinen Wald besuchen möchtest, können wir nach Absprache eine kostenlose Besichtigung vor Ort organisieren. </p>
<p>Während des Besuches wirst Du die Möglichkeit haben, einen Besitzerstein mitten in deinen Wald zu legen. Er wird Deinen Namen und Deine weitsichtige Entscheidung den Wald zu kaufen, eingraviert haben. </p>
<br/>
<h3>Wo das Geld verwendet wird</h3>
<p>Du kaufst eine Aktie einer australischen Aktiengesellschaft. Das eingenommene Geld wird für den Waldkauf, Waldpflege, Aufforstung und Firmenunkosten verwendet. Die Firma wird, festgeschrieben in der Firmensatzung, jeder Aktie die ausgegeben wird einen Baum zuordnen.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Vorteil deiner Investition</h3>

<p>Wir beobachten seit 1993 australische Waldpreise. Ein Wald der 1993 für $17,000AUD angeboten wurde, ist heute $115,000AUD wert. Wenn Du das mit Zinsen oder sogar dem Aktienmarkt vergleichst, ist das eine Rendite von sage und schreibe 9,5% pro Jahr! </p>

<p>Auf weltweiter Ebene werden in allen Ländern bald Steuern auf CO2 Emission erhoben werden. Waldbesitzer werden eine Steuergutschrift für ihre Sauerstoffproduktion bekommen. (In Australien gab es das schon -carbon tax- und wird es wahrscheinlich mit der nächsten Regierung auch wieder geben :)) Daher werden die Preise für Wald weltweit ansteigen. Du kannst erwarten, dass nächstes Jahr der Preis für eine Aktie (ein Baum) schon $27AUD sein wird.</p>
<p>Wie es aussieht, kann dieser Baumkauf als langfristige Anlage gesehen werden, die sogar als Rentenbeitrag geeignet wäre. Kaufe jede Woche einen Baum und Du wirst in nach 30 Jahren über $200,000AUD besitzen. (vorausgesetzt der Wert von Bäumen steigt jedes Jahr um ca. 9.5%)</p>

Buy a living tree,
and reduce climate change!

Deforestation
and Global Warming are prevailing! These are the simple facts: 
Deforestation
Climate Change 1 
Climate Change 2

It is important to keep our environment as livable as it is today for our future generations. Therefore we want to sell living trees to
the public. 

25 sqm of forest will sell for $25AUD with a guaranteed minimum of
one tree on it.

A tree that you own can not be cut.
Be a hero
It is time to make a difference. Now you can show that you care. This is the chance to DO something. Everybody can afford to buy a tree. Do it NOW and share it with the wold.
How it worksThe business model is very
simple and transparent. You can buy a share of the company that owns the forest. You'll get all the documents such as a share certificate, company
titles, and GPS coordinates of your tree/s.  The
Australian legal system guarantees long term safety of the forest and your
investment.

As a non-for-profit company we would also guarantee by our company constitution to reinvest any
surplus into reforestation. 
The best thing is that you get immediate value for your investment. If the campaign is successful (= $250 000 AUD invested), you own the trees which you have already paid for. If not, you'll get your money back. This is how we want to set up the project.
We are very excited about our project, because this has never been done on a global basis before.  We could create a public market for living trees and that would help our environment tremendously.

Benefit for the climate


Trees produce oxygen and take vast amounts of CO2 and
other greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. Trees moderate Earth's temperature; - keeping Earth
cooler in Summer and warmer in Winter.
70% of the world's forests have already been cut down and
continue to be cut down faster than they are currently being replanted. This is causing extreme Climate Change and
Desertification globally.

Reforestation is the ONLY solution!
A tree that you own can not be cut.
According to a study (http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2013/11...) based on Google Earth we have estimated that there are only 100 trees to each human on this planet left today. With our project you can buy one of these trees for as little as $25. You would get 25 sqm of forest with a guaranteed minimum of 1 tree on it. With an investment of as little as $2500 you can secure enough trees for a lifetime supply of oxygen for yourself.





Perks
1. $25AUD one living tree
You'll get a share certificate and GPS coordinates of the tree. You'll be a proud owner of a living tree, that cannot be cut.
2. $250AUD ten living trees
You'll get ten share certificates and GPS coordinates of the trees. You'll be a proud owner of a tiny living forest that cannot be cleared. You would also get a preview of the tree allocation map and a photo of your trees. 
3. $2500AUD hundred living trees
You'll get one hundred share certificates and GPS coordinates of the trees. You'll be a proud owner of a small living forest that cannot be cleared. You would also get a preview of the tree allocation map and a photo of your trees. If you want to visit your forest, we can organize free entry to the property/forest.
During this visit, you would have the option to place an ownership stone in the middle of your trees with your name carved onto it. It would also say, that you bought those trees in order to protect them. This stone will be placed with the intent to keep it standing for many many generations to come.

Where the money goes
You buy a share of the company. This money will go into buying forests, maintaining forests, reforesting, and company administration. The company, by its constitution, will assign one tree to all shares released by the company.  

Your return on investment

Since 1993 we are observing Australian forest pricing. A forest worth $17,000AUD in 1993 is worth today $115,000AUD. If
you compare with interest rates today, or the share market even, this is an incredible
return of 9.5% per year! 

With taxes on carbon emission coming soon worldwide, forest
owners will get money for their oxygen production. Hence the prices for forests
will rise. So next year you can expect the share price for one tree to be $27
already.
As it stands, this investment could be an excellent addition to a retirement fund for job starters. Keep buying one tree each week and you have saved over $200,000 after 30 years. (providing value for trees goes up by 9.5% each year)
A tree that you own can not be cut.

Non-For-Profit

The constitution of the company would guarantee to reinvest any surplus into reforestation and buying forests. It would also state that any trees which get destroyed by natural forces (flood, diseases, ...) will be replaced with other trees at a new location (so you will never loose your trees). The company will cover all costs of maintaining the forests, and keep extending the assets of the company by buying new forests (business plan). The long term goal is to reforest deserted areas, which we have plenty of in Australia.
The Founder

My name is Walter Gith. I was born in Germany and living in Australia now. I studied physics in Germany. After starting an IT career with a consulting company I later worked as a manager in a large corporation for 10 years. For 14 years now, I have been running a small software company in Australia. For as long as I remember I loved trees. I recognize that trees play a large part to keep us alive on this planet as they provide the air we breathe.
You can visit us on Facebook to follow the project.



FAQ

Can I pay with credit or debit card?
Yes,
first select ‚Pay with PayPal‘. Then there is an option ‘Pay with a credit or debit
card’. After you entered the Card details, you will be asked to use the
details to open a PayPal account. But in the same window there is a button that
allows you to “Continue’ without creating a PayPal account. Choose this option.  
Can I contribute any amount?
Yes, you don't need to choose a PERK. Any contribution amount that is a multiple of $25AUD will be used to issue shares and attracts the benefits of a $25 PERK. If you contribute $250AUD we will automatically handle this as PERK 2 (accordingly for $2500AUD).   
For obvious reasons please choose multiples of $25 as your contribution/payment amount.
Can I sell, donate, bequeath or give away the share?
Yes. An ownership change request will be necessary. The company register change causes a fee. If you want to give away the share as a present, just put the receivers email address in the first email box that comes up.
Is this campaign restricted to Australia? 
No, this is a worldwide campaign. Everybody in the world is allowed to buy company shares. There is also a German translation of this page further down. Many browsers like Chrome also provide a 'translate page' feature.
How is the relation between tree and share?
You can only buy a living tree (we are not talking about trees form nurseries), if you own the land where it is on. The company buys the land with the trees on it. The share represents the part of the company that equals 25 sqm. The company guarantees by its constitution that there is a minimum of one tree per 25 sqm (this could be verified for you through Google earth).

Where would the forest be bought?We will start in Australia. Other regions could follow as the company grows.
What is in it for the founder?

The founder is happy that forest is saved. But in case of success he also gets a salary for the administration work. The company's financial reports will be sent to all shareholders.
When the campaign fails, would I get the whole $25AUD back?
YES
What is INDIEGOGO?
It is a crowd-funding platform: Many small single contributors together make an investment in a company. Often is the investment lost. Not in our case. The company would only be founded if the critical sum of $250000 investment is reached. If it is not reached, all participants will get their money back, which is guaranteed by Indiegogo (fixed funding). If reached, everybody gets a share with tree rights attached.

Kauft lebendige Bäume
und schützt unser Klima!

Waldrodung und Klimawandel sind Tatsachen: 
Rodung
Klimawandel 

Es ist wichtig, unsere Umwelt so lebenswert wie sie heute ist, auch für zukünftige Generationen zu bewahren. Deshalb wollen wir lebendige Bäume zum Kauf anbieten. 

25 qm Wald werden $25AUD kosten, mit einem garantierten Minimum von einem Baum auf dieser Fläche.

Ein Baum den Du besitzt, kann nicht gefällt werden.
Das Geschäftsmodel ist einfach und durchsichtig. Du kannst eine Aktie der Firma kaufen, die den Wald besitzt. Du wirst alle Dokumente, so wie Aktienzertifikat, Eigentumsrecht und GPS Koordinaten deiner Bäume zugesendet bekommen. Das australische Rechtssystem garantiert die Sicherheit der Bäume und die Stabilität der Eigentumrechte über lange Zeit.

Als eine Firma, die über die Firmensatzung keinen Gewinn erzielen darf, garantieren wir alle Uberschüsse in Waldaufforstung zu investieren. 
Das beste ist, dass Du einen direkten Gegenwert für deine Investition bekommst. Wenn die Kampagne erfolgreich ist (= $250 000 AUD erreicht), wirst Du die Bäume besitzen, die Du schon bezahlt hast. Wenn nicht, bekommst Du dein Geld zurück. So ist diese Kampagne mit Indiegogo gestaltet.
Wir sind stolz auf dieses Projekt, weil so etwas auf globalem Level noch niemals zuvor gemacht wurde. Wir können einen öffentlichen Markt für lebendige Bäume kreieren und dadurch der Umwelt helfen.

Vorteile für die Umwelt

Bäume erzeugen Sauerstoff und nehmen eine große Menge CO2 und andere Treibhausgase aus der Atmosphäre auf. Bäume mässigen die Temperaturen auf der Erde.
70% der Weltbaumbestände sind bereits gerodet und die Rodungen halten an. Es wird mehr gerodet als wieder angebaut. Dies verursacht Klimawandel und Versteppung weltweit.

Aufforstung und Bestandssicherung ist die EINZIGE Lösung!
Ein Baum den Du besitzt, kann nicht gefällt werden.
Nach einer Studie (http://www.sciencemag.org/content/suppl/2013/11...), basierend auf Google Earth, haben wir geschätzt, dass es heute nur ungefähr 100 Bäume für jeden Mneschen auf dieser Welt gibt. Mit unserem Projekt kannst Du einen dieser Bäume für nur $25AUD kaufen und sichern. Du wirst 25 qm Waldfläche mit einem garantierten Baum darauf bekommen. Mit einer Ausgabe von nur $2500AUD kannst Du genug Bäume sichern, um Dich dein Leben lang mit Sauerstoff zu versorgen.





Leistungen (PERKS)
1. $25AUD ein lebendiger Baum
Du bekommst ein Aktienzertifikat und die GPS Koordinaten von Deinem Baum. Dann bist Du ein stolzer Besitzer eines lebendigen Baumes, der nicht gefällt werden kann.
2. $250AUD zehn lebendige Bäume
Du bekommst ein Aktienzertifikat und die GPS Koordinaten von Deinen Bäumen. Dann bist Du ein stolzer Besitzer eines kleinen Waldes, der nicht gerodet werden kann. Du bekommst auch vorab eine Karte mit der Position deiner Bäume und ein Photo. 
3. $2500AUD hundert lebendige Bäume
Du bekommst ein Aktienzertifikat und die GPS Koordinaten von Deinem Baum. Dann bist Du ein stolzer Besitzer eines kleinen Waldes, der nicht gerodet werden kann. Du bekommst auch vorab eine Karte mit der Position deiner Bäume und ein Photo. Wenn Du deinen Wald besuchen möchtest, können wir nach Absprache eine kostenlose Besichtigung vor Ort organisieren. 
Während des Besuches wirst Du die Möglichkeit haben, einen Besitzerstein mitten in deinen Wald zu legen. Er wird Deinen Namen und Deine weitsichtige Entscheidung den Wald zu kaufen, eingraviert haben. 

Wo das Geld verwendet wird
Du kaufst eine Aktie einer australischen Aktiengesellschaft. Das eingenommene Geld wird für den Waldkauf, Waldpflege, Aufforstung und Firmenunkosten verwendet. Die Firma wird, festgeschrieben in der Firmensatzung, jeder Aktie die ausgegeben wird einen Baum zuordnen.  

Vorteil deiner Investition

Wir beobachten seit 1993 australische Waldpreise. Ein Wald der 1993 für $17,000AUD angeboten wurde, ist heute $115,000AUD wert. Wenn Du das mit Zinsen oder sogar dem Aktienmarkt vergleichst, ist das eine Rendite von sage und schreibe 9,5% pro Jahr!

Ein Baum den Du besitzt, kann nicht gefällt werden.

Die Satzung der Firma wird vorschreiben, dass anfallende Gewinne in Waldpflege und Waldaufbau reinvestiert werden. Die Satzung wird ebenfalls garantieren, dass Bäume die durch Naturgewalten zerstört worden sind (z.b. Waldbrand) durch neue Bäume ersetzt werden.

We’ve been on Earth2 since January 2021, with over 1500 tiles owned and a property value of 7000 dollars , and our dream is to build  “OP”  fully immersed in nature...in a complex of several paradisiac islands (info about coordinates will be released in the next phase),  designed to be futuristic and innovative at the same time, but as the price of land goes up daily we need your help to acquire the entire designated area and to create a solid team made up of experts in human rights, engineering, architecture, social coexistence, urban developments, wellbeing, pollution and environment, that can ensure the correct development of “OP ”.
Our goal is to create a perfect model of cities that are green, modern, colorful  and totally self-sustainable... to create a community made of people investing in the future, still believing in a better future
                                      
We know that the only way to be successful in this ambitious project is to ensure that every detail is perfectly executed
We are what we repeatedly do, therefore excellence is a habit not an act. Even though we know it's just a virtual starting point, we aim to create a new way of communicating and living in real life
We are simply faced with a choice...We can rise again as humanity, or we'll be slowly cleared away, one by one, as humans. Our time is limited, the future depends on what we do today
We still believe that not everything is lost , We can turn this vision into reality
We need you to make some noise out of there...tell your family, friends, colleagues and strangers about OP...share this page on your social networks 
Every single act, even the smallest one, can make the difference, nothing change unless you do
 
We need you to believe again
We need you to hOPe again",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Pencils are used in learning and creative works by students, designers, architects, planners and for some office duties. Pencils have stood the test of time. Without doubt, they will continue to be important components of our daily activities.   BUT DO YOU KNOW?  About 15 billion pencils are made worldwide every year. This means about 88,000  trees are cut down yearly. This is tragic, and its environmental impact is devastating! Trees are life. Quality of life on Earth depends on the number of trees around. Less trees is undoubtedly a threat to human survival.  Global warming is seriously challenging life on Earth.  Cutting down this huge numbers of trees contribute greatly to this disturbing phenomenon.  We've got to change.   This is the reason why as a group of young and enterprising individuals in Ghana that are yearning to contribute our quota towards saving our Earth  from the worsening climatic condition, We came up with the idea of making pencils from recycled newspapers and magazines which are usually littered or improperly disposed and hence, creating serious environmental problems.   Our ECOLOPH pencils are as hard as wood but easy to sharpen.  They don't contain any chemicals and are of higher quality.   AND MORE ABOUT OUR ECOLOPH PENCILS IS THAT.....We prioritise the demands and feelings of people. So we do customised branding on every ECOLOPH  pencil we make to satisfy the taste of people.     We do this to create some form of attachment between a person and an ECOLOPH  pencil we create.  ECOLOPH  pencils can therefore be used as special presents to your loved ones, as gifts and donations and also as portable billboards for the dissemination of information to people.   WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT to get standard machines  to perfect our manufacturing process and also increase our production capacity to make our impact significant.  The project will be far from being successful without your SUPPORT.   Here are few reasons why you should be part of this life changing project; . 1. For every 30 inch stack of Newspaper  recycled for these pencils a 20 feet tall tree will be spared. This will contribute towards the improvement of the ecosystem and thus combating global warming.  2. Also recycling a ton of Newspaper saves 3 cubic yards of landfill space, 7,000 gallons of water and enough energy to power an average home for six months.  3. For every $5 (or above)  you support us with, we will make a number of pencils (depending on the amount) , brand them according to your taste and give them to a needy child on your behalf.  This will go a long way to help the many needy children in Ghana struggling with basic educational materials such as pencils. ( Details of our various perks can be found in the perks section of this campaign ) 4.  Finally apart from the fact that this will promote and conserve the ecosystem, it will provide jobs for people( Especially the youth and women) and thus alleviating poverty. This is important.  More people will have an opportunity to a decent and productive life.   Remember every cent that will be spent on this project will be fine-tuned into  GREENING our world again

<h3>Greenhouse gases emissions caused by human activities</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Humankind has emitted more than 2,000 gigatons of CO₂ since 1750 (1 gigaton = 10⁹ metric tons) and has destroyed more than 3.5 x  10⁹ hectares of previously vegetated ecosystems in the approximately 10,000 years since agriculture became widespread. After the widespread implementation of agriculture, only a very small number of people have led completely sustainable lifestyles, and since fossil fuels became the most potent energy source exploited by humankind an ever smaller number of individuals have led sustainable and carbon neutral lifestyles. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>All of us who live in industrialized, consumerist societies generate significant greenhouse gases emissions from all the industrially produced goods and services we consume every year. Data generated by the US Department of Energy's CDIAC for 2011 shows that the most efficient economies among developed nations are located in the European Union, as their populations only average 8.6 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent emissions per capita per year while having some of the highest standards of living in the world. Japan, in turn, averages 9.3 MT CO₂ e per capita per year, while Russia is at 12.6 MT CO₂ e. Canada, Australia and the USA all are among the largest polluters in the world with 14.1, 16.5 and 17 MT CO₂ e per capita per year respectively. The Arab petroleum exporting countries have the least efficient economies in the world in terms of production to emissions, with all of them averaging significantly more than 20 MT CO₂ e per capita per year. India and China, which are the two countries with the largest populations in the world, are still far below this levels of emissions, with only 1.7 and 7.2 MT CO₂ e per capita per year respectively. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Highly accurate estimates of the annual and cumulative historical emissions generated by any individual, household or corporation can be obtained at any of the myriad of carbon footprint calculators that are freely available over the internet. </p>

<h3>
<br/>The city of Las Vegas and unsustainability</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is perfectly known and established that Las Vegas is one of the cities furthest away from financial and ecological sustainability in the history of the world. Las Vegas is one the largest desert cities in the world, it has a permanent population of around 2.5 million people and receives more than 40 million visitors each year. Food consumption is consequently huge, but local production in Clark County is practically nonexistent. USDA data shows that less than 1% of the edibles consumed in Las Vegas are produced locally as the city is instead supplied from distant places at a huge financial and ecological cost. Las Vegas's entire water supply is diverted a great distance all the way from the Colorado River and practically 100% of the products it collectively consumes are supplied from distant locations at a steep financial and ecological cost . Las Vegas also consumes energy and electricity nowhere near the levels of what it could produce sustainably from renewable sources on its own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>– greening Las Vegas – is a project about ecosystem regeneration and the USA is the perfect country to start regenerating ecosystems in. The USA is the biggest originator of greenhouse gases emissions in world history and the USA also has the largest current emissions of all countries at both an aggregate and per capita levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480474279/j2vn05jkwnu9wygc3hwa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Destruction of forested areas is another one of the main causes of anthropogenic global climate disruption and the USA is also among the countries that have degraded the most land in history. From approximately 1600 to 1920, the immigrants of European origin who colonized the land that eventually became the USA caused the permanent deforestation of around 30% of the forested area in the territory (122,000,000 hectares or 1,220,000 km² of forests were lost) and destroyed 90% of what previously had been virgin forests.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<br/>Methodologies and impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>– greening Las Vegas – would be a demonstration site for the USA that would aim to prove to an audience as wide as possible that it is perfectly feasible to sustainably and productively regenerate ecosystems in large scale anywhere in the world. The principal objective for this project is to sustainably afforest 8 hectares of land that are currently permanent desert, permanently sequester more than 4,000 metric tons of CO₂ and sustainably and locally produce tens of tons of superior quality organic food in Las Vegas. All this would be achieved by increasing the biomass on the site to the maximum levels at which the regenerated ecosystem can be self sustaining and self sufficient. Carbon is the main building block in biomass, constituting 45% of the dry mass of plants in average. Humus, or topsoil, is an even more concentrated deposit of carbon, with 58% of its its mass being carbon in average.  Therefore, forests act as carbon sinks with up to 50% of their total biomass and humus being made up of carbon. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480474429/u5hsne3msy8zqblcwmmw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>The designed forests that this project would establish would utilize no agrochemicals, no motorized irrigation from the city's water supply, would need no agricultural machinery to do work on them and their yields would require no processing or long distance transportation to reach their destination. These systems would be truly sustainable as they would rely only on naturally occurring local resources like: naturally occurring sunlight incidence, rainfall and condensation, natural fertilizers like compost and plant nutrients that are freely available in the atmosphere. As sustainable designed forests rely exclusively on renewable energy and resources, make no use of fossil fuels or external inputs once established and the amount of CO₂ / C they sequester can exceed the amount of CO₂ that is emitted to set the whole system up by a factor of more than 30 times, these setups are heavily carbon negative.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>In our selected location, the first operations would be to carry out earthworks on the plot to improve the landscape's water retention and storage capacities. Hardy plants that are adapted to the local conditions would then be distributed throughout our setup to support the establishment of the similarly adapted productive species that would also be present. Another important factor to note is that collaborative plants would be selected so that competition for resources is minimal and species instead complement one another. Progressively, zero runoff landscapes with total ground covers will become established and ecosystems will be regenerated. Other elements like seedlings, saplings, compost, mulching material, plastic sheets, shading cloth, tubing, rainwater storage tanks, fencing, and other infrastructure would also be deployed as was necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>The systems, techniques and methodologies used to regenerate ecosystems and set up designed forests are perfectly known and established by science and previous experience. Ecosystem regeneration has been successfully carried out in small and large scales; with two of the most decisive and well-known extensive large scale examples being the reclamation of the Les Landes de Gascogne former desert in France and the Huangtu Gaoyuan (Loess Plateau) Watershed Rehabilitation Project in China.  Other similar projects to regenerate degraded ecosystems have been carried out in Zimbabwe, as well as in other places in Africa. These regenerative systems, techniques and methodologies are also adaptable to completely different locations all over the world; whether they have temperate, humid, boreal, tropical or any other kind of local climate. The following is a merely illustrative list of the very diverse locations where designed forests have been successfully established in the USA:  Asheville, North Carolina; Boston, Massachusetts; Los Angeles and San Francisco, California; Austin, Texas; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Glendale and Youngstown, Ohio; Viola and Madison, Wisconsin; Tacoma and Seattle, Washington; Bloomington, Indiana; 2 sites in Chicago, Illinois; Moretown, Vermont and many more. Around the world, designed forests have been set up in the Lungau Region in Austria; New South Wales, Australia; Waiheke Island, New Zealand; London, England; Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta; Cowichan Valley, British Columbia; Toronto, Ontario, all these in Canada and some of the most studied and modeled after designed forests were set up in Iyo, Ehime, Japan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Many regeneration projects like the ones included in my illustrative videos have been successfully carried out all over the world with good results even when they were severely underfunded. Such lack of funding has meant that even though biomass at the locations was successfully increased and ecosystems were indeed regenerated, these projects ended up not being as productive as they could have been. At the – greening Las Vegas – location, once the designed forests that would be set up had reached maturity, this regeneration project over its 8 hectares could be annually producing more than 11 metric tons of tomatoes, 12 tons of potatoes, 5 tons of grapes, 16 tons of lettuce, 6 tons of cantaloupe, 5 tons of maize, 13 tons of hot peppers, 14 tons of onions, 16 tons of squash, 8 tons of eggplant, 5 tons of okra, 1 ton of capsicum, and 7 tons of cucumber. In turn, once the perennial systems that would be established had matured fully, they could annually yield more than 1 metric ton of figs, 5 tons of pomegranates, 13 tons of oranges, 6 tons of apricots, 2 tons of tangerines, 10 tons of apples, 16 tons of pears, 4 tons of olives, 6 tons of dates, 8 tons of mangoes, 10 tons of guavas and 23 tons of lemons.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Ecosystem regeneration transformations like the one proposed for the – greening Las Vegas – project are far superior in terms of efficiency and effectiveness and are not at all equivalent to the mere planting of tree saplings. The first consideration is that it would be necessary to plant at least 23 tree saplings to sequester 1 metric ton of CO₂ in two years. Additionally, tree saplings plantations in arid regions / drylands commonly suffer from very elevated mortality rates, that can range anywhere from 70 to 95% of plantings dying before 5 years. Therefore, it would be necessary to plant as many as 80 to 460 tree saplings to sequester 1 metric ton of CO₂ in two years in comparable locations to – greening Las Vegas – (while our project would capture 4,000 MT CO₂ over 8 hectares). The survival rates for ordinary plantations can only be increased by expending large amounts of energy and irrigation water on the saplings (which imply higher greenhouse gases emissions), and this also makes those kind of plantations unsustainable as the vegetation is completely dependent on those outside inputs and has no chance of surviving on its own when human intervention is halted. Even when some trees manage to survive on their own, a small number of sparsely interspersed trees on their own will have a very limited beneficial impact on the ecosystem in the short- and medium-term, and consequently, the amount of biomass that would be created from rudimentary tree plantations would be far smaller even in the best case scenario. Designed, integral ecosystem regeneration projects, on the other hand, can afforest land that is currently a permanent desert in 3 to 5 years or less with passive technologies and methodologies that help establish self-sustaining, self-sufficient and self-replicating ecosystems.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding target</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>$ 400,000 USD would be a nice funding target. The main elements of the project and their  preliminary estimated proportions of the total expenditure are as follows:  </p>
<p>            <br/>land                                                                                                                                            15%<br/>all research and design costs  *                                                                                       20%<br/>earthworks and all other structural work                                                                        7%<br/>planting and all other transformation related costs over 20 acres                     30%<br/>legal, logistics and other miscellaneous expenses                                                      8%<br/>operating costs for 6 months                                                                                            15%<br/>indiegogo and payment services fees and costs                                                    6 - 8%</p>
<p>* the research and design costs would cover a master design that could, with minor modifications, be applied in any location around Las Vegas and Clark County.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There definitely will be other additional costs like permits, fees, applications, commercial, fiscal and legal expenses, etc. Also, a temporary drip irrigation system and other equipment could represent a sizable expenditure but it can't be designed or projected before the location has been secured (an atmospheric water condenser might be necessary, or not). A building on site could also become necessary as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>We would offer only one class of rewards: proportional credit for the carbon / CO₂ captured by the regeneration project according to the sum donated by each contributor. A third party would be asked to verify that the biomass and carbon in the location have been increased and by how much. This project is all about sustainability, ecology and local consumption, therefore, sending cheap mementos around the world as rewards for contributors would defeat its purpose and would be a waste of resources.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>The methods and techniques to set up productive designed forests are well researched and established. Given the appropriate conditions plants will grow, zero runoff landscapes with total ground covers will become established and ecosystems will be regenerated. Effective, top level design and sufficient funding can ensure the regenerative transformations are successful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only possible obstacles could be laws and regulations that restricted this kind of projects. The solution would be to adapt as was necessary to the legal requirements of each location.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<br/>Other Ways People Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Well, yes, any and all publicity and social media promotion would be great.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Also, if someone with legal expertise would know of cheaper ways to procure vacant land in the metropolitan area of Las Vegas and Clark County that could be used to plant trees and designed forests, that would be hugely helpful. Maybe there could ways to secure long term leases or donations for idle public lands. Reducing the cost of land would help the project cover more hectares and have a greater impact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/>Everybody can also help global ecology by growing their own food, consuming local products, adopting an ecologically and financially sustainable lifestyle, reducing waste, and reducing their greenhouse gases emissions.</p>

            land                                                                                                                                            15%all research and design costs  *                                                                                       20%earthworks and all other structural work                                                                        7%planting and all other transformation related costs over 20 acres                     30%legal, logistics and other miscellaneous expenses                                                      8%operating costs for 6 months                                                                                            15%indiegogo and payment services fees and costs                                                    6 - 8%
* the research and design costs would cover a master design that could, with minor modifications, be applied in any location around Las Vegas and Clark County.
 
 
There definitely will be other additional costs like permits, fees, applications, commercial, fiscal and legal expenses, etc. Also, a temporary drip irrigation system and other equipment could represent a sizable expenditure but it can't be designed or projected before the location has been secured (an atmospheric water condenser might be necessary, or not). A building on site could also become necessary as well.
 
We would offer only one class of rewards: proportional credit for the carbon / CO₂ captured by the regeneration project according to the sum donated by each contributor. A third party would be asked to verify that the biomass and carbon in the location have been increased and by how much. This project is all about sustainability, ecology and local consumption, therefore, sending cheap mementos around the world as rewards for contributors would defeat its purpose and would be a waste of resources.
 

Risks & Challenges
 
The methods and techniques to set up productive designed forests are well researched and established. Given the appropriate conditions plants will grow, zero runoff landscapes with total ground covers will become established and ecosystems will be regenerated. Effective, top level design and sufficient funding can ensure the regenerative transformations are successful.
 
The only possible obstacles could be laws and regulations that restricted this kind of projects. The solution would be to adapt as was necessary to the legal requirements of each location.
 

Other Ways People Can Help
 
Well, yes, any and all publicity and social media promotion would be great.
 
Also, if someone with legal expertise would know of cheaper ways to procure vacant land in the metropolitan area of Las Vegas and Clark County that could be used to plant trees and designed forests, that would be hugely helpful. Maybe there could ways to secure long term leases or donations for idle public lands. Reducing the cost of land would help the project cover more hectares and have a greater impact.
 
Everybody can also help global ecology by growing their own food, consuming local products, adopting an ecologically and financially sustainable lifestyle, reducing waste, and reducing their greenhouse gases emissions.",2.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h3><strong>Save the woods on the beach</strong></h3>
<p>The woods on East Beach are home to beautiful well established Oak trees right on the beach. The land is approximately a third of an acre but it's now up for sale, as with most of the surrounding areas it will most likely be bought by a developer that will pull all the trees out and put up a really flashy modern beach house that will probably be a second or third house for someone very well off.</p>
<p>The land has been empty for over 20 years after a previous development application was refused. I'm sure they will eventually change the planning policy as more new housing is needed.</p>
<p>I enjoy walking along the beach with my family and dog and if the weather is good, we go swimming in the sea. Unfortunately the woods have always been fenced off with razor wire on the top so no one enjoys them. I think this is quite sad as the atmosphere under the canopy of oak trees on a sunny day is magical. I want to save the trees from future development and create a space that can be enjoyed by people that love being in nature.</p>

He met Nana, by now his wife, who gave up the comfort and security of an European life to join Abdoul in his fight for his dream: trees to give shade and to stop the ongoing desertification.Together they raised the money to dig a second well in a more promising spot. The hole is there, but no possibility to buy a pump, as funds are empty like the old well.Now this is where you can help: the old diesel pump, which Abdoul and Nana named ""The Old Lady"" beside being unecological, is not reliable, breaking continually.To supply the thirsty trees without causing emissions that will in the end hurt them, they want to raise the money for a solar pump with appliances. All in all, this will cost around 4000 euro. If each of us would contribute with only a small amount, we could raise this reasonable sum of money in no time. In exchange, Abdoul and Nana would be happy to have you as guests in the desert camp.And if you don’t see yourself getting there too soon, I am personally happy to give something in exchange for your donation.You can choose between:
a printed set of film photography postcards from the desert camp and surroundings.
a HQ image file for you to print as small or as big as you desire.
Thank you for helping us keep the desert alive!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The IE Homestead is launching our first agricultural project on a bit earlier timeline than expected, beekeeping. These tiny critters are some of the hardest and most important workers in nature. </p>
<p>This project is important to us to strengthen the land that we are homesteading on. We've recently joined the Texas Beekeeper's Association and are working with experienced beekeepers to properly work with our bees.</p>
<p>While the home site isn't complete - the colonies will be placed in areas that will not be disturbed by the building process. By supporting us, you are investing in Texas AG, local farming, and your friends. </p>
<p>We think you'll enjoy supporting us and the fun donation tiers that we have created. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The campaign is asking for a total of $4000. We plan to start with 8 colonies.</p>
<p>The cost breakdown is roughly, 2650 for 8 double hives+ super, 160 for hive placement materials, and 675 for basic beekeeper supplies for the family. The remaining 500 is buffer &amp; tangible items from this promotion. </p>
<p>We're asking for support because the beekeeping timeline and costs have cut into the home-site budget. Your donations will 100% go to our bee-keeping endeavor. Any unused donations from this campaign will be donated to the local chapter of the Texas Beekeeping Association. </p>
<p>We will be completely transparent by sharing updates through our vlog, e-mails from this platform, and a final cost sheet of where all monies were spent.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are little risks to donating to our bee-launch project. The funds will be used 100% towards our beekeeping efforts on the homestead &amp; any unused funds are going to the local chapter of the Texas Beekeepers Association.</p>
<p>We've sourced bees from a farm about 40 minutes north of us and are working with the local beekeepers association to learn proper bee-handling techniques. Due to COVID-19, we may or may not get to work hands-on with a beekeeper prior to picking up our own bees (mid-April).

<p>Water concerns nationwide and globally are continuing to grow, with car washing being sited as a major contributor to water use and pollution.

Utilizing our Waterless Wash and Wax the typical family sedan can be cleaned with around 16 ounces. Compared to over 100 gallons used in your typical home car wash. This is a <strong>MASSIVE</strong> difference, that can really make an impact! <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467482689/ss0v4r6k2hhagz3g1ave.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> products will save millions of gallons of water every year.</p>

<p><i>Photo (CM Images): The recycling process beginning in Cambodia, separating absolutely everything by hand!</i></p>
<p>I’m an individual with 15 years experience in recycling and an interest in helping the local environment. I grew up in England working for my family’s recycling business but I’ve now been living in Siem Reap, Cambodia for the last 4 years.  During this time, I’ve seen a real need for a similar recycling system to be set up in the local community. </p>
<p>Through the approximate 250 tonnes of rubbish discarded and collected for landfill daily, a large proportion of this will contain various materials such as paper, plastic bottles, cans, and numerous other recyclable materials. Instead of having the potential to be created into new products, they will simply be buried under the earth, discarded on the street or burnt by locals (a common practice found out here).</p>
<p>Being able to recycle is a brilliant way for businesses to reduce their environmental impact, the amount of poisonous gases being created through the rubbish being burnt, and to protect environmental habitats for local flora and fauna.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To do this, I am looking to raise $150,000 for the construction of a warehouse and purchase of a machine that will compact and bale the different materials. The baled materials will then be sold and profits made will be re-invested back into the local community. The land is purchased and ready to be utilised!</p>
<p>As I initially offered 20% to potential business investors, I will donate 20%-30% of what the project makes on a yearly basis to community projects that provide clean drinking water for impoverished villages and free schooling for local children.  </p>
<p>Depending on the size of contributions from our generous donors, we will look to offer meaningful 'perks' that will show the difference your donation has made. </p>
<p>I will provide project updates through the funding page, social media, and meetings to keep everyone interested up-to-date. I’ll try my best to provide details around materials collected and how much is prepared for recycling on a monthly basis - just so everyone out there knows what a huge difference their support is making! </p>
<p>So, to break it down, the money raised will get the bare basics of the project going.</p>
<ul>
<li>A warehouse for storage, delivery of materials to be sorted and protection for staff from mother nature.</li>
<li>A fence to enclose the project site.</li>
<li>The baler / machine needed to compact and bale the various materials.</li>
<li>Set up and maintenance of utilities, such as electricity and running water.</li>
<li>Running costs to remove the materials once they are compacted and baled.</li>
<li>The employment and training of local staff to support the delivery of the recycling project. </li>
</ul>
<p>In return, the team will offer small rewards and perks on the successful running of the campaign!</p>
<ul>
<li>Good karma!</li>
<li>A clean city when you decide to come and visit!</li>
<li>Donations made on your behalf to properly run charities and NGOs.</li>
<li>Hand painted pictures of the city and its iconic landmarks.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Being so close to the Angkorian ruins, tourism in Siem Reap has expanded at an enormous rate. Huge expensive, lavish, as well as budget hotels have popped up everywhere, with tourism becoming a vast and lucrative industry. To meet the demand, local business, bars, restaurants, and cafes continue to open up to feed the increased number of visitors to the city every year.</p>

<p><i>Photo (CM Images): Siem Reap is a gateway to the amazing temples, visited by millions of tourists every year.</i></p>
<p>As a result of this tourism boom, the amount of rubbish generated has also increased to alarming levels in a community that is not familiar with the term 'recycling'. Rubbish is discarded in a number of ways in the city, as many can not afford to have the rubbish collected. You can find bottles and cans littered on roads and footpaths, while plastics can be found in the city's rivers and waterways. A common practice also used by locals is to burn household rubbish out in the open, this results in poisonous gases entering the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Due to high levels of poverty in the area, many have no choice but to go through rubbish bags and waste sites to collect cans, plastic bottles and other materials of value. These loose materials are then transported 5 to 7 hours away for little reward to those who collected it. Children are especially made vulnerable as they are exposed to dangerous situations and unhealthy environments as a means to support their struggling families. </p>
<p>To prevent this, we want to recycle as many materials as possible, regardless of value, to prevent adults and children from wandering the streets and entering waste sites. While this can not be stopped from day one, we will look to offer a profitable, safer and easily accessible means for individuals to deposit any materials they do collect, which will hopefully include materials considered of lesser value. The purchase of the machine will allow us to take all materials that people bring us. While we have begun working with a couple of businesses in the area with their recycling, we aim to expand this further as the project goes on. </p>

<p><strong>Premises and principles</strong></p>
<p>The project concerns the ethical sector of safeguarding the natural heritage.</p>
<p>In particular, the focus is on the figures: more than 15 billion trees a year are cut down in the world, often without any preliminary dendrological evaluation.<br/>This means, for example, that the criterion for the selection of trees to be cut takes into account maximum economic yield and minimum effort, therefore relying to prefer the older trees strongly involved in preserving the forest balance.</p>
<p>A WWF alert since 2015, to give an idea of ​​the phenomenon: <a href=""https://www.wwf.it/news/notizie/?15340"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.wwf.it/news/notizie/?15340</a></p>
<p>However, limiting the situation to an ecological issue could be misleading.<br/>It is woth to notice that the structure that until now has characterized many of the ""green revolutions"" has miserably failed getting their bearings reabsorbed into the system.<br/>Aware of this, the ARGO Project does not therefore only advance an ecological proposal, but aims to give voice to the ever more emerging need of an anthropological revolution.</p>
<p>The sociologists, in fact, has noticed that the new generations are investing a large part of their efforts in trying to create new social models, where they can find a satisfying relational environment, also with regard to work and professions. <br/>In this way, phenomena such as coworking, coliving, teamworking, ecovillages and digital nomads are becoming more and more frequent.</p>
<p>These new models are rediscovering and re-identifying in nature a substantial factor for psychophysical rebalancing, recognizing it as the elective habitat for the general well-being of the individual, if only for necessity.</p>
<p>The principle from which the ARGO project proposes to leave is to ""restore freedom"" to trees [and extensively to the whole nature] which, like slaves, belong to the owner of the land that hosts them. Their life belongs to a master, who for his maximum profit prevents trees from living and prospering freely.</p>
<p>More extensively, ARGO aims to make Nature obtain the right to be recognized as a legal entity and thus to have a legal personality.<br/>A pioneer in this sense is New Zealand where the original population of the Mahori in 2017 get this credit on a sacred river, thanks to the promulgation of a law that recognizes the deep connection between the people and its land, creating something strong for the future we have born in mind.</p>
<p>Although it may sound a little theatrical, the evaluations supporting this principle are, on the contrary, decidedly mathematical. The survival habitat of our species is progressively getting smaller under our astonished and confused gaze. The state of the art in the sector, in fact, is detecting alarming statistics and exponentially expanding charts, and the international community is constantly involved in buffer-solutions to the most known eco-sociological problems: deforestation, intensive agriculture, irreversible loss of biodiversity, electromagnetic pollution, urban social alienation, technology pervasiveness in everyday life, suicidal instincts downed on the new generations, old people abandoned to vices, drugs and television, children offered in feed to the vacuum of identity.</p>
<p>Each of us knows well what is happening to our Home.</p>
<p>It is necessary, as soon as possible, to create a mechanism of inversion of tendency: this is what the ARGO Project proposes for attributing to nature its role of primary human necessity.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
<p>The ARGO Project therefore proposes a patented model of transversal protection, which allows the collective participation in the purchase, so liberation, of vast areas of land, and of consequent ecological and social rehabilitation of the liberated lands, with attractive crypto-speculative repercussions for the public, which so incentivized makes itself a supporter of the whole virtuous mechanism.</p>
<p>Argo looks towards the rebirth of big trees, surface waters, and a new and more evolved ecological compromise.</p>
<p>It briefly includes:</p>
<p>-GAIAN: the name of the ICO, and consequently of the first legalized cryptocurrency, designed to ""free the land"".</p>
<p>-ARGOLANDS: areas of ""free land and human preservation"" where to flourish better ideas for our future, protected for 99 years (foresting).</p>
<p>-ARGO.BASE: a Protection Body, with blockchain-based transparent administration, set up to protect the Argolands in the form of a non-profit Trust according to Anglo-Saxon Law.<br/><br/> </p>
<p><strong>The main accessory projects are:</strong></p>
<p>- QEVA: the first earthship in a mounting box, designed to be printed through 3D technologies using rapid geopolymer mortars (totally biocompatible, studied with Gilberto Quarneti).</p>
<p>- ADAM: the centrifugal permaculture model applicable in Argolands (similar to the Demeter model, but characterized by the adoption of the Distributed Land Clustering).</p>
<p>- GLIV: an innovative E-CO-Living model on the Argolands border-limits, for digital nomads and more, adjacent to:</p>
<p>- JURASSICS: nurseries and forests highly characterized by flora-fauna biodiversity.</p>
<p>- SHINING CAMPS: training and socialization areas for young people.</p>
<p>- VERTICAL RETREATS: places dedicated to spiritual retreat, meditation and well-being.</p>
<p>- JOURNEISM: a travel ""guided by Kairos"", timeless, through the Argolands.</p>
<p>- IAD (Internet Addiction Disorder) detox protocols: to come back from the depersonalizing effects that technology has generated on us</p>
<p>- BLOCKSTONE®: an exclusive and patented validation procedure for legal blocks (AgID and equivalent territorial authorities), with smart-contracts maintained according to the international standard of notary level.<br/><br/>Within the Argolands, however, technology is not present, much less money. Anthropization is extremely sweet and rarefied, and will therefore be constituted oases for retreats, trials including experiments of metaculture, pilgrimages, excursions, as well as of course tje presence of those who will live there.</p>
<p>Safeguard is entrusted to all of us, as the foundation will assign the ""Essent"" (minimum units of land per person) in custody to volunteers whose whish is LIVING NATURE in friendship with it: the Custodians.<br/>Within the limits of the strict preservation and surveillance protocols provided by Argo.Base, they will be able to experiment new and free forms of anthropization.</p>
<p>The time schedule provides, as early as the 12th month after the ICO, the establishment of a ranking and so the selection and training of Custodes for the assignment of the liberated lands.</p>
<p>The Argo.Base trust device includes the White-paper of the ARGO project, which contains the philosophical cornerstones offerred through the translation in its operative focus, including each metric.</p>
<p>Among other things, it defines in detail the safeguarding constraints and the measures of the penetration of the communities in the territories, but maintains maximum respect towards individual freedom, creativity and cooperation initiatives.</p>
<p>The Trust therefore administers the economic assets so that they reach their maximum valorization in compliance with the aims set out in the Device Act.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><strong>How does it work:</strong></p>
<p>The proposed dream is to allow the main public to invest in the liberation of the earth; to gain and at the same time ""going to heaven"" by ensuring future generations better corners of the world.</p>
<p>What does it mean to invest in the Argo project?</p>
<p>Investing in Argo means investing in the most revolutionary ECO-ICO of this century, that is a cryptocurrency of the latest-generation, consolidated by an innovative method of legalization of the contents referred to in the hash-code inside any node of the “blockchain” chain used, which is called Blockstone.</p>
<p>In addition, the use of Blockstone allows to link a real estate value to the currency, ensuring stability.<br/>The “countervalue in lands” allows to connect the public's need for a safe and high-yield investment, to the ""liberation of the land"", in a mechanism of exponential growth, by making sure - why not? - that the speculative anxiety inherent the human being can become a lever of radical changes, rather than a destructive engine.</p>
<p>The Argo.Base Trust therefore supervises the liberated areas (Argolands), to allow them to experience a slow process of biological reactivation, so that no one will take over the next few years the elements that could perhaps represent a possibility of survival in the future.</p>
<p>The last century has seen the overcoming of many scientific boundaries. Among the emerged awareness, there is the direct dependence of human well-being on the quality and congeniality of the habitat that hosts it. This, translated in terms of ecological balance and sustainability, leads to the definition of the measure of the Essent:</p>
<p>1 E = 100,000 square meters</p>
<p>ESSENT is therefore the measure of natural soil necessary not only to feed and drink physically, but also to nurture and support psychophysiologically an individual, in respect of all its basic needs, to be understood in the broadest and most comprehensive meanings, to arrive at a harmonic and fulfilling health and balance condition.</p>
<p>The Essent is therefore the existential unity sufficient to the passive sustenance of an individual.</p>
<p>ECONOMIC VALUE which a single ESSENT is composed by:<br/>€ 15000: maximum purchase cost per hectar (ha), multiplied per 10<br/>€ 8000: administration costs, outsourcing, taxes, brokerage, power of attorney<br/>€ 2000: reinvestment in new lands to issue additional currency<br/>€ 100: G reserve for re-use in transverse labs</p>
<p>Total: 25.100 euros</p>
<p>Obviously they must be NATURAL soils, or free from abuse and irreversible speculation, or vegetative sourcless such as deserts, pantanal, etc. Building lands, or characterize by strong construction susceptibility, or limited by historical constraints, high agricultural productivity lans, high tourist attractiveness land, etc., are also excluded.</p>
<p>Each Essent is therefore equal to 10 ha, 100,000 square meters.<br/>The Essents in the Argo model are then divided into small units of 100 square meters, called Argo-cluster.<br/>The ARGO-CLUSTER (Acl) are therefore small patches of land, indicative extension 10 x 10 m, digitally identified by means of georeferenced planialimetric coordinates.</p>
<p>1 E = 1000 Acl<br/><br/> </p>
<p><strong>The GAIAN (G) token</strong></p>
<p>Token in the language of ICO means “item of currency other than coins and paper money”, in this case it is digital.</p>
<p>The Argo token, which will be issued and offered for purchase during the ICO period, is called GAIAN.</p>
<p>Each token (Gaian) issued corresponds to an Acl. As we told, an Acl (Argo-cluster) is a clustered fraction of an Essent, equal to 1/1000th part of its extension.</p>
<p>1 Acl = 0,001 E = 100 square meters</p>
<p>The value of the token G can therefore be calculated as a thousandth part of the value of an Essent:</p>
<p>25.100 / 1000 = € 25.1</p>
<p>Thetotal supplyof tokens, which represents the amount to be reached through the ICO, is fixed on the basis of a pre-set target of 100 Essent to be released, about 1000 hectares, for a total of 100,000 Gaian, 2,510,000 euros.</p>
<p>The time-lasting of the ICO is ment to be of about 4 weeks.</p>
<p>The ICO is approximately scheduled for March 2019, and will be preceded by a few months of auditing and pre-ICO.<br/>During these preliminary phases it will be possible to obtain friendship-bonuses by actively participating in the project start-up, convertible in Gaian after the consolidation of the currency on the exchanges.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><strong>The counterpart of the token</strong></p>
<p>The user, by purchasing a G, acquires the Bare Ownership of the Acl unit of land, in order to protect it. This Right is obviously also a guarantee that, like a mortgage, allows the investor (Argo Angel) to have a recourse in the event of non-compliance by the obligations of Argo.Base, and a rescue-solution in case of more serious problems.</p>
<p>At the same time as the purchase, the Argo Angel grants the Leasehold estate of the corresponding Acl, and therefore the physical availability, to the Argo.Base.</p>
<p>The non-profit Argo.Base Trust is designed to minimize the costs of maintaining the ArgoLands, including taxes, only and exclusively for the 99 years of its Mission of Safeguarding; at the end however, if the Uses and the legal guidelines will be evolved, the land will be formally released, returning it to earth itself.<br/>If this won’t be the case, it will be necessary to provide otherwise, primarily by perpetuating the protection.</p>

<p>The platform (Argolands.com), through IT systems and proprietary applications, distributes the land to be safeguarded - whose Property was previously acquired by the Argo Trust.Base - in Acl (Argo-cluster 10x10 mt), assigning and legalizing an ID-code per Acl.</p>

<p>Buying these lands at low cost, freeing them, and keeping them, represents a hope for present and future generations.</p>
</div></div>","Premises and principles
The project concerns the ethical sector of safeguarding the natural heritage.
In particular, the focus is on the figures: more than 15 billion trees a year are cut down in the world, often without any preliminary dendrological evaluation.This means, for example, that the criterion for the selection of trees to be cut takes into account maximum economic yield and minimum effort, therefore relying to prefer the older trees strongly involved in preserving the forest balance.
A WWF alert since 2015, to give an idea of ​​the phenomenon: https://www.wwf.it/news/notizie/?15340
However, limiting the situation to an ecological issue could be misleading.It is woth to notice that the structure that until now has characterized many of the ""green revolutions"" has miserably failed getting their bearings reabsorbed into the system.Aware of this, the ARGO Project does not therefore only advance an ecological proposal, but aims to give voice to the ever more emerging need of an anthropological revolution.
The sociologists, in fact, has noticed that the new generations are investing a large part of their efforts in trying to create new social models, where they can find a satisfying relational environment, also with regard to work and professions. In this way, phenomena such as coworking, coliving, teamworking, ecovillages and digital nomads are becoming more and more frequent.
These new models are rediscovering and re-identifying in nature a substantial factor for psychophysical rebalancing, recognizing it as the elective habitat for the general well-being of the individual, if only for necessity.
The principle from which the ARGO project proposes to leave is to ""restore freedom"" to trees [and extensively to the whole nature] which, like slaves, belong to the owner of the land that hosts them. Their life belongs to a master, who for his maximum profit prevents trees from living and prospering freely.
More extensively, ARGO aims to make Nature obtain the right to be recognized as a legal entity and thus to have a legal personality.A pioneer in this sense is New Zealand where the original population of the Mahori in 2017 get this credit on a sacred river, thanks to the promulgation of a law that recognizes the deep connection between the people and its land, creating something strong for the future we have born in mind.
Although it may sound a little theatrical, the evaluations supporting this principle are, on the contrary, decidedly mathematical. The survival habitat of our species is progressively getting smaller under our astonished and confused gaze. The state of the art in the sector, in fact, is detecting alarming statistics and exponentially expanding charts, and the international community is constantly involved in buffer-solutions to the most known eco-sociological problems: deforestation, intensive agriculture, irreversible loss of biodiversity, electromagnetic pollution, urban social alienation, technology pervasiveness in everyday life, suicidal instincts downed on the new generations, old people abandoned to vices, drugs and television, children offered in feed to the vacuum of identity.
Each of us knows well what is happening to our Home.
It is necessary, as soon as possible, to create a mechanism of inversion of tendency: this is what the ARGO Project proposes for attributing to nature its role of primary human necessity.
 
Mission
The ARGO Project therefore proposes a patented model of transversal protection, which allows the collective participation in the purchase, so liberation, of vast areas of land, and of consequent ecological and social rehabilitation of the liberated lands, with attractive crypto-speculative repercussions for the public, which so incentivized makes itself a supporter of the whole virtuous mechanism.
Argo looks towards the rebirth of big trees, surface waters, and a new and more evolved ecological compromise.
It briefly includes:
-GAIAN: the name of the ICO, and consequently of the first legalized cryptocurrency, designed to ""free the land"".
-ARGOLANDS: areas of ""free land and human preservation"" where to flourish better ideas for our future, protected for 99 years (foresting).
-ARGO.BASE: a Protection Body, with blockchain-based transparent administration, set up to protect the Argolands in the form of a non-profit Trust according to Anglo-Saxon Law. 
The main accessory projects are:
- QEVA: the first earthship in a mounting box, designed to be printed through 3D technologies using rapid geopolymer mortars (totally biocompatible, studied with Gilberto Quarneti).
- ADAM: the centrifugal permaculture model applicable in Argolands (similar to the Demeter model, but characterized by the adoption of the Distributed Land Clustering).
- GLIV: an innovative E-CO-Living model on the Argolands border-limits, for digital nomads and more, adjacent to:
- JURASSICS: nurseries and forests highly characterized by flora-fauna biodiversity.
- SHINING CAMPS: training and socialization areas for young people.
- VERTICAL RETREATS: places dedicated to spiritual retreat, meditation and well-being.
- JOURNEISM: a travel ""guided by Kairos"", timeless, through the Argolands.
- IAD (Internet Addiction Disorder) detox protocols: to come back from the depersonalizing effects that technology has generated on us
- BLOCKSTONE®: an exclusive and patented validation procedure for legal blocks (AgID and equivalent territorial authorities), with smart-contracts maintained according to the international standard of notary level.Within the Argolands, however, technology is not present, much less money. Anthropization is extremely sweet and rarefied, and will therefore be constituted oases for retreats, trials including experiments of metaculture, pilgrimages, excursions, as well as of course tje presence of those who will live there.
Safeguard is entrusted to all of us, as the foundation will assign the ""Essent"" (minimum units of land per person) in custody to volunteers whose whish is LIVING NATURE in friendship with it: the Custodians.Within the limits of the strict preservation and surveillance protocols provided by Argo.Base, they will be able to experiment new and free forms of anthropization.
The time schedule provides, as early as the 12th month after the ICO, the establishment of a ranking and so the selection and training of Custodes for the assignment of the liberated lands.
The Argo.Base trust device includes the White-paper of the ARGO project, which contains the philosophical cornerstones offerred through the translation in its operative focus, including each metric.
Among other things, it defines in detail the safeguarding constraints and the measures of the penetration of the communities in the territories, but maintains maximum respect towards individual freedom, creativity and cooperation initiatives.
The Trust therefore administers the economic assets so that they reach their maximum valorization in compliance with the aims set out in the Device Act.
 
How does it work:
The proposed dream is to allow the main public to invest in the liberation of the earth; to gain and at the same time ""going to heaven"" by ensuring future generations better corners of the world.
What does it mean to invest in the Argo project?
Investing in Argo means investing in the most revolutionary ECO-ICO of this century, that is a cryptocurrency of the latest-generation, consolidated by an innovative method of legalization of the contents referred to in the hash-code inside any node of the “blockchain” chain used, which is called Blockstone.
In addition, the use of Blockstone allows to link a real estate value to the currency, ensuring stability.The “countervalue in lands” allows to connect the public's need for a safe and high-yield investment, to the ""liberation of the land"", in a mechanism of exponential growth, by making sure - why not? - that the speculative anxiety inherent the human being can become a lever of radical changes, rather than a destructive engine.
The Argo.Base Trust therefore supervises the liberated areas (Argolands), to allow them to experience a slow process of biological reactivation, so that no one will take over the next few years the elements that could perhaps represent a possibility of survival in the future.
The last century has seen the overcoming of many scientific boundaries. Among the emerged awareness, there is the direct dependence of human well-being on the quality and congeniality of the habitat that hosts it. This, translated in terms of ecological balance and sustainability, leads to the definition of the measure of the Essent:
1 E = 100,000 square meters
ESSENT is therefore the measure of natural soil necessary not only to feed and drink physically, but also to nurture and support psychophysiologically an individual, in respect of all its basic needs, to be understood in the broadest and most comprehensive meanings, to arrive at a harmonic and fulfilling health and balance condition.
The Essent is therefore the existential unity sufficient to the passive sustenance of an individual.
ECONOMIC VALUE which a single ESSENT is composed by:€ 15000: maximum purchase cost per hectar (ha), multiplied per 10€ 8000: administration costs, outsourcing, taxes, brokerage, power of attorney€ 2000: reinvestment in new lands to issue additional currency€ 100: G reserve for re-use in transverse labs
Total: 25.100 euros
Obviously they must be NATURAL soils, or free from abuse and irreversible speculation, or vegetative sourcless such as deserts, pantanal, etc. Building lands, or characterize by strong construction susceptibility, or limited by historical constraints, high agricultural productivity lans, high tourist attractiveness land, etc., are also excluded.
Each Essent is therefore equal to 10 ha, 100,000 square meters.The Essents in the Argo model are then divided into small units of 100 square meters, called Argo-cluster.The ARGO-CLUSTER (Acl) are therefore small patches of land, indicative extension 10 x 10 m, digitally identified by means of georeferenced planialimetric coordinates.
1 E = 1000 Acl

<p>We are here to source fund in order to enable us start our

of the<a href=""#44630212"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by ExstraCoupon""> country<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a>. We have lived in Europe and we have seen how clean and healthy
the environment can be and we also know the health benefit of a clean
environment and also the health risk and environmental hazards associated with
waste littered environment. We have gathered experience in waste management by
working in some of the reputable waste management companies in Europe.</p>
<p>Looking at what waste can do and what can be done with waste
in terms of recycling and knowing fully well that many people are not aware of
the danger that locks behind every waste littered on the roads, rivers, dumpsites
and every nook and cranny of the environment. It is difficult to control and
manage the level of waste being dumped on every road side you walk by. This
waste has grown to the level of blocking all the drainage systems and rivers in
the city and<a href=""#47714876"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by ExstraCoupon""> states<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> thereby causing unseen harm to the people and the
environment at large.</p>
<p>Many people are yet to know the extent these wastes can go
in endangering their lives and the natural environment due to their lack of
knowledge on how to manage waste, so our aim is to educate and create awareness
on how to handle waste and manage it effectively. In the villages and local
areas where the poor people and uneducated once are living is where this danger
locks the most. This people don’t have enough to eat not to talk of knowing
what to do or how to keep the environment clean in order to avoid diseases and
other sickness that comes with unclean environment there is need to educate
those at the rural areas.</p>
<p>How can someone whose
daily lively hood is below $2.00 afford to pay for hospital treatment when he
or she is ill, they simply keep quiet and die slowly in pains? We weep for them
and we believe that when the environment is cleaned up the less privileged even
without money to feed can still survive and live long in a cleaner environment.</p>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><b>Our goals:</b></p>
<p>Creating awareness on the hazards and harmfulness of unclean
environment</p>
<p>Eliminating waste on the roads, rivers, lakes and through
rivers to avoid contamination</p>
<p>Reducing environmental pollution which is the originator of
some health issues facing us today</p>
<p>Creation of job opportunity for the local people and the
poor masses that can barely feed </p>
<p>Installing a deep waste collection container in every area of
the states</p>
<p>Providing a regular waste collection services all over the
state</p>
<p>Set up waste collection center in every local area of the
states</p>
<p>Generating revenue into the states purse through waste
collection, sorting and recycling.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED:</b></p>
<p>Not to mince words, we need money:</p>
<p>We are upcoming company and we need financial support to
carry out our project </p>
<p>We need money to pay wages to employees who are going to put
in their hearts and body to clean all the wastes off the roads and river side
and every dump areas that are posing threats to lives</p>
<p>We also need infrastructure support.</p>
<p><b>What we will do with the money:</b></p>
<p>Buy lots of deep waste collection containers and install
them in every local areas, market places and city centers of every state in the
eastern part of Nigeria.</p>
<p>Buy also a small waste collection container for every
residential building in the states</p>
<p>Buy waste collection vehicles or trucks that collect waste
from every municipality in the states</p>
<p>Educate the people on the benefit and usefulness of clean
environment and also on how to use the deep waste collection containers (how to
separate waste and putting the waste in the right container).</p>
<p>Train the employees on how to collect and transport waste
and also how to separate or sort wastes.</p>
<p>Purchase few acres of lands in every municipality for the
setting up of the waste collection center.</p>
<p>Build a recycling facility in a separate but not too distant
location where all the collected and sorted recyclable items can be recycled
and bagged for further use</p>
<p>Lease a vast land for dumping non recyclable waste thereby
inviting expert in energy plant building to come in and create energy from the
waste for the locals living close to the area.</p>

We are Enviro clean face ltd, we are team of three and we
studied facility management in the University.
We are here to source fund in order to enable us start our
waste management and recycling facility in Nigeria basically the eastern part
of the country. We have lived in Europe and we have seen how clean and healthy
the environment can be and we also know the health benefit of a clean
environment and also the health risk and environmental hazards associated with
waste littered environment. We have gathered experience in waste management by
working in some of the reputable waste management companies in Europe.
Looking at what waste can do and what can be done with waste
in terms of recycling and knowing fully well that many people are not aware of
the danger that locks behind every waste littered on the roads, rivers, dumpsites
and every nook and cranny of the environment. It is difficult to control and
manage the level of waste being dumped on every road side you walk by. This
waste has grown to the level of blocking all the drainage systems and rivers in
the city and states thereby causing unseen harm to the people and the
environment at large.
Many people are yet to know the extent these wastes can go
in endangering their lives and the natural environment due to their lack of
knowledge on how to manage waste, so our aim is to educate and create awareness
on how to handle waste and manage it effectively. In the villages and local
areas where the poor people and uneducated once are living is where this danger
locks the most. This people don’t have enough to eat not to talk of knowing
what to do or how to keep the environment clean in order to avoid diseases and
other sickness that comes with unclean environment there is need to educate
those at the rural areas.
How can someone whose
daily lively hood is below $2.00 afford to pay for hospital treatment when he
or she is ill, they simply keep quiet and die slowly in pains? We weep for them
and we believe that when the environment is cleaned up the less privileged even
without money to feed can still survive and live long in a cleaner environment.

Our goals:
Creating awareness on the hazards and harmfulness of unclean
environment
Eliminating waste on the roads, rivers, lakes and through
rivers to avoid contamination
Reducing environmental pollution which is the originator of
some health issues facing us today
Creation of job opportunity for the local people and the
poor masses that can barely feed 
Installing a deep waste collection container in every area of
the states
Providing a regular waste collection services all over the
state
Set up waste collection center in every local area of the
states
Generating revenue into the states purse through waste
collection, sorting and recycling.
WHAT WE NEED:
Not to mince words, we need money:
We are upcoming company and we need financial support to
carry out our project 
We need money to pay wages to employees who are going to put
in their hearts and body to clean all the wastes off the roads and river side
and every dump areas that are posing threats to lives
We also need infrastructure support.
What we will do with the money:
Buy lots of deep waste collection containers and install
them in every local areas, market places and city centers of every state in the
eastern part of Nigeria.
Buy also a small waste collection container for every
residential building in the states
Buy waste collection vehicles or trucks that collect waste
from every municipality in the states
Educate the people on the benefit and usefulness of clean
environment and also on how to use the deep waste collection containers (how to
separate waste and putting the waste in the right container).
Train the employees on how to collect and transport waste
and also how to separate or sort wastes.
Purchase few acres of lands in every municipality for the
setting up of the waste collection center.
Build a recycling facility in a separate but not too distant
location where all the collected and sorted recyclable items can be recycled
and bagged for further use
Lease a vast land for dumping non recyclable waste thereby
inviting expert in energy plant building to come in and create energy from the
waste for the locals living close to the area.
Purchasing standard collecting and processing infrastructure
with any leftover fund.

Recycling as a future project:
Our company is a diversified one; we are also going into
recycling of all the recyclable materials ranging from: plastics, paper,
cardboards and metals. The company intends to open a collection centers all
over the states where all the recyclable items can be collected bagged and
transported to the recycling plant in future.
We will appreciate the little you are able to donate but if you can not help us financially we will also appreciate if you can help us to tell your friends and families to support us in starting this company which will help to creat jobs for the less privelege thanks",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>I am Sande Allan, a graduate of IBA  from Unites states International University.  I am a hustler, seasoned businessman, business development consultant and a firm believer in social enterprise.</p>
<p>This campaign comes as an opportunity to enable us engage marginalized members of our community into gainful employment, wealth creation and community economic transformation using simple low cost technologies.</p>
<p>This is after over 3 years effort seeking local funding to move our concept to reality.</p>
<p>We already have over 500 youth organized under a local community based organization engaged in waste collection to the dumpsite.

<p>As a funding partner, we seek both cash and physical equipment to achieve our goals and being the founding funders we shall travel the entire journey together and ensure a full update of the entire project.</p>

<p>This is the first private total waste recycling solution engaging local community in the value chain and already had received local acceptance and ownership.</p>
<p>Whatever little fund we manage to secure on this platform will go towards moving the project forward even if its purchase of one item. We believe every step, is a step forward.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project first will use the funders support to contribute towards a better leaving environment where what we call waste is converted into permanent value thereby improving the social economic lifestyles of the community members we engage.</p>
<p>As a business development consultant i have so far contributed to the success of two social enterprises engaging the girl child in low cost sanitary pad manufacturing, marketing, distribution and mhm capacity building training.</p>
<p>This project is a continuation of my passion towards collective efforts to achieve the much needed economic transformation across africa.</p>
<p>In its first year of operation this project will directly impact 500 community members among women and youth which will grow as we scale up.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we want to create a feeling of ownership for the project among the citizens, whose waste is managed and whose local environment is improved by the Project. Our Youth will be collecting waste from community homesteads at a maximum of 1.5 to 2.0 usd per month. We also seek to engage the community to participate the waste segregation at site program to make the recycling process easier.</p>
<p><strong>MEASURABLE IN NUMBERS</strong></p>
<p>• 300 full time employment opportunities;</p>
<p>• One decentralized SWM project covering 5,000 people, or 2,000 households and commercial premises;</p>
<p>• 400 grams of biodegradable waste per household per day to be composted into organic manure;</p>
<p>• 600 grams of non-biodegradable waste per household per day to be recycled or reused.</p>

<p>One such risk is linked to the hand-over of the project to the community. There is a risk of the community not prioritizing the project after it has been handed over to them.</p>
<p>We hope to mitigate this risk by creating a solid support for the project among various Community actors, e.g. the public government officials, private corporations, school pupils, volunteers, employees, and etc, and thereby increasing the expectations on the community administration.</p>

<p>As projects are handed over to the NSSWM, they also run the risk of becoming politicized and the Self Help Group members risk being used to gain political sympathies in different groups. It is important that all parties are aware of this risk and that it is reduced as</p>
<p>much as possible through community participation, transparency, and local ownership.</p>
<p>The household collection fee of USD 1.5-2 per month is another obvious risk factor. Since government budgets for SWM systems generally are covered by the overall property tax, there will most probably be an initial resistance towards the monthly fee to be paid by the Households from the current 0.5-1.5 usd.</p>
<p>It will take some time to convince the public of the project benefits. Hence, in order to get the project rolling, the first months of waste collection will be at the same fee with some subsidy coming in to support from the county government and other project promoters.</p>

This project first will use the funders support to contribute towards a better leaving environment where what we call waste is converted into permanent value thereby improving the social economic lifestyles of the community members we engage.

vertically position?  </b></p>
<p><b><span>A: A standard paint tray is filled with
paint and laid on the floor. The open configuration of the tray dries the paint
and the roller out and exposes the paint and roller to airborne debris. The
enclosed nature of the Enviro paint tray eliminates that problem. </span></b></p>
<h2><b>Work Place Hazard </b></h2>
<p><b>An open tray of paint and a
roller laid on the floor of a busy work site is an obvious hazard for passing
foot traffic. Securing the paint and the roller, vertically within the Enviro
paint tray eliminates that problem.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Q</b><b>: What stops the paint and the roller from drying out?  </b></p>
<p><b><span>A: The Enviro
paint tray has unique internal features that create a terrarium effect; this
stops the paint from skinning over and the roller from drying out. </span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b>Q</b><b>: How long can I leave the paint and the roller in Enviro
paint tray before they dry out?  </b></p>
<p><b><span>A: The paint and the roller can be left over night, a
couple of days or a week depending on conditions etc.   NB:
Store The Enviro paint tray inside out of direct sun light and strong wind! </span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b>Q:</b><b> Can I use any paint roller frame with the Enviro paint tray  </b></p>
<p><b><span>A: No! The Enviro paint roller frame must be used to
complete the system.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b>Q:</b><b> Can I transport the Enviro paint tray in my vehicle with
paint in it?  </b></p>
<p><b><span>A: Yes, make sure it is firmly secured in
a fully protected position in the vehicle out of direct sun light and strong
wind</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b>Q</b><b>: What type of paint can I use in the Enviro paint tray?  </b></p>
<p><b><span>A: For best results I recommend quality
water based paints and coatings.  NB: Oil or solvent based paints and coating may be
used but have limited storage time.   2Pack paints and coating are not recommended
at this time. </span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b>Q</b><b>: Do I have to put 6 litres of paint in the Enviro paint tray
every time? 
 </b></p>
<p><b><span>A:
No you can put as little as 1 litre of paint OR whatever is required to a
maximum of 6 litres. </span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b>Q</b><b>: What size roller sleeve can I use?   </b></p>
<p><b><span>A:
The Enviro paint tray will accommodate 230mm 270mm or 360mm roller sleeves. </span></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Q</b><b>: Can I use an extension pole with the Enviro paint roller?  </b></p>
<p><b><span>A:
Yes, if required.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b>Q</b><b>: What size extension poll can I use?  </b></p>
<p><b><span>A: The Enviro paint tray is very stable and you can
use fixed polls from .5m/ 2Ft up to 1.8m/ 6Ft and extension polls form .5m/ 2Ft
right up to 3.6m/ 12Ft.  </span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b>Q</b><b>: How do I clean the Enviro paint tray?   </b></p>
<p><b><span>A: The
paint tray detaches from the external housing for easy cleaning access.  </span></b></p>

work site like open paint trays?   </b><br/></p>
<p><b><span>A: No it’s easy; just secure the roller in the slot on
top of the housing. Close up the paint tray, grab the handle and off you go. </span></b></p>

Works
The paint
and the roller are enclosed inside the Enviro paint tray. The tray has unique
internal humidifying features that create a terrarium effect.  

               This stops the paint and roller from                             drying out! 

                            Advantage


 With the paint and the roller protected there is no need to wash the roller or tray at the end of the day.
 
Its so easy 
I just close it up and that’s it! I can
lock it up and leave it on site or pop it in the van and go home.  It can be left over night, a couple of days
or a week for that matter and the paint and the roller are still  good to go.  

If you are a a painter you will know just how 
cool that is!


 




Productivity

   The Enviro
Paint Tray doesn’t eliminate cleaning rollers and trays, but not having to wash them up
every day and then set up again the next day has 

increased the productivity of  my business. 

Not washing up and setting up rollers and paint trays has saved my business $5000 AUD per year per painter.

Goal
My goal right now is to produce the Enviro Paint Tray by injection molding and make the worlds first Eco friendly painting system more affordable and available to everyone.
  

Ready to Go.

I’ve been working with a first class Australian company to converted my designs from costly aluminium to injection molding. Their high tech plastic is as tough as
nails and will stand up to the rigors of any heavy handed painter. The mold designs, CAD drawing, branding, packaging, costing and production time line
have been completed and the project is  
on track and ready to go.

The
tooling and set up required for injection moulding is incredible expensive and
that is why we are asking for your financial support through  crowd funding.

Frequently
asked Questions
                                                                                                                                                             Q: Why does the Enviro paint tray close up and stand in a
vertically position?  
A: A standard paint tray is filled with
paint and laid on the floor. The open configuration of the tray dries the paint
and the roller out and exposes the paint and roller to airborne debris. The
enclosed nature of the Enviro paint tray eliminates that problem. 
Work Place Hazard 
An open tray of paint and a
roller laid on the floor of a busy work site is an obvious hazard for passing
foot traffic. Securing the paint and the roller, vertically within the Enviro
paint tray eliminates that problem.

Q: What stops the paint and the roller from drying out?  
A: The Enviro
paint tray has unique internal features that create a terrarium effect; this
stops the paint from skinning over and the roller from drying out. 

Q: How long can I leave the paint and the roller in Enviro
paint tray before they dry out?  
A: The paint and the roller can be left over night, a
couple of days or a week depending on conditions etc.   NB:
Store The Enviro paint tray inside out of direct sun light and strong wind! 

Q: Can I use any paint roller frame with the Enviro paint tray  
A: No! The Enviro paint roller frame must be used to
complete the system.

Q: Can I transport the Enviro paint tray in my vehicle with
paint in it?  
A: Yes, make sure it is firmly secured in
a fully protected position in the vehicle out of direct sun light and strong
wind

Q: What type of paint can I use in the Enviro paint tray?  
A: For best results I recommend quality
water based paints and coatings.  NB: Oil or solvent based paints and coating may be
used but have limited storage time.   2Pack paints and coating are not recommended
at this time. 

Q: Do I have to put 6 litres of paint in the Enviro paint tray
every time? 
 
A:
No you can put as little as 1 litre of paint OR whatever is required to a
maximum of 6 litres. 

Q: What size roller sleeve can I use?   
A:
The Enviro paint tray will accommodate 230mm 270mm or 360mm roller sleeves. 

Q: Can I use an extension pole with the Enviro paint roller?  
A:
Yes, if required.

Q: What size extension poll can I use?  
A: The Enviro paint tray is very stable and you can
use fixed polls from .5m/ 2Ft up to 1.8m/ 6Ft and extension polls form .5m/ 2Ft
right up to 3.6m/ 12Ft.  

Q: How do I clean the Enviro paint tray?   
A: The
paint tray detaches from the external housing for easy cleaning access.  
Q: Is the Enviro paint tray hard to lift and carry around a
work site like open paint trays?   
A: No it’s easy; just secure the roller in the slot on
top of the housing. Close up the paint tray, grab the handle and off you go. 

Q:
Will the plastic model of the Enviro paint tray work as efficiently as the aluminium
premium model shown in the video? 
 


A:
Yes, and it will perform to the highest possible standard faultlessly every
time.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Save Australia's Wildlife during this Wildfire Catastrophe</span></h3>
<p>The current fire season is the worst on record in Australia, with millions of hectares of bushland destroyed, dozens of people killed or missing, and reports of up to a billion animals dead and injured. Koalas are one of Australia's most beloved animals, but are now critically endangered native animals.</p>
<p>When you back this campaign, 100% of the profits will go towards the WIRES Australian Wildlife Rescue Organisation (<a href=""https://www.wires.org.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wires.org.au</a>).</p>
<p>I designed this #SaveKoalasPin pin as a perk to specifically to help raise awareness and urge everyone to take action in contributing donations to save the animals impacted by this catastrophe in Australia. </p>
<p><strong>Important! </strong>To contribute &amp; claim a pin, make sure to select the #SaveKoalasPin perk on the right hand side. Do not directly enter your own amount to back the campaign, otherwise I cannot give you the pin!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need at least 100 pins to meet the minimum production requirement from the supplier so this is a <strong>Fixed Funding</strong> campaign and will only kick off once we meet the goal; if we don't meet the goal, all of the funds will be refunded as per Indiegogo's rules. This campaign will be activated for Indiegogo's <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204092046-InDemand-FAQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">InDemand function</a>, so that you can still claim the #SaveKoalasPin perk after the first 100 goal is met, to generate as many donations as possible. Production takes about 1 month, and approximately 2 weeks for delivery after the campaign ends. However, all profits after expenses will immediately go to WIRES as soon as the goal is met.</p>
<p>To give full visibility into how where your money will go, see this estimated expense break-down per pin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Koala Pin Price for Indiegogo backers: US$15 (US$21 after shipping costs)</li>
<li>Estimated factory cost to produce: ~US$1.25-1.85 per pin</li>
<li>Estimated shipping cost: ~US$5-6.50</li>
<li>Indiegogo platform cost: US$1.05 (5% of the funds raised)</li>
<li>Indiegogo payment processor cost: US$1.32 (3.9%+USD$0.50)</li>
<li><strong>Estimated Proceeds to WIRES Australian Wildlife Rescue: ~US$10.28-$12.37 per pin; total US$1,028~$1,237 for first 100 pins.</strong></li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As reported by CNN <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/01/australia/australia-fires-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>, Australia is being ravaged by the worst wildfires seen in decades, with large swathes of the country devastated since the fire season began in late July.</p>
<p>A total of 27 people have died nationwide, and in the state of New South Wales (NSW) alone, more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged. State and federal authorities are struggling to contain the massive blazes, even with firefighting assistance from other countries. All this has been exacerbated by persistent heat and drought. New South Wales has been hit the hardest.</p>
<p>WIRES Australian Wildlife Rescue Organisation (<a href=""https://www.wires.org.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wires.org.au</a>)'s mission is to actively rehabilitate and preserve Australian wildlife. They have been rescuing and caring for wildlife for over 30 years and is the largest wildlife rescue organisation in Australia. They have a strong reputation in Australia to support the current wildfire catastrophe and in the past, they have responded to more than 90,000 rescues each year.</p>
<p>With a focus on New South Wales which is the area that's being hit the hardest, that's the reason I've chosen to start this campaign &amp; donate all the profits from this campaign to WIRES.</p>
<p>Below is a rough calculation of amount of money raised to WIRES below based on amount of pins backed:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 pins ~ US$1,237 in proceeds to WIRES</li>
<li>200 pins - US$2,474 in proceeds to WIRES</li>
<li>500 pins -  US$6,185 in proceeds to WIRES</li>
<li>1000 pins - US$12,370 in proceeds to WIRES</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Production will kick off as soon when campaign finishes at 45 days assuming we meet the 100 pins goal ($2,100 USD or $16,500 HKD). As I haven't produced any of the pins yet and it’s my first time, the production &amp; shipping costs may fluctuate, but through my extensive research and contacting multiple suppliers, I have confidence in the reasonable estimation of the amount of money that can directly go towards WIRES with each Koala Pin backed. As well, since it will take time to produce the pins, please expect around 1 month for production and 2 weeks for shipping, however all of the proceeds received after expenses (at least the US$11.60 per pin) will be donated as soon as the first 100 pins goal is met.</p>
<p>I will also try my best to ensure that the actual pin looks exactly like the design of the  mock-up but please be mindful that there may still be discrepancies after actual production due to the that handmade items may still have minor imperfections. In addition the mock up is not to scale, actual size of pin will be 1” in width. </p>
<p>Since this is a Fixed Funding campaign type, If we don't meet the 100 pins goal, all amounts will be refunded 100% as per Indiegogo's guidelines.</p>
<p>I will make sure to keep updating the progress on this page on donations to WIRES, actual costs of the expense,  as well as the fulfilment timelines.</p>

<p>No fancy credentials here. Just two sustainably-minded graduate students finishing up their journeys with the VCU da Vinci Center.

<p>Green Wheels' founders, Ian Ragland and Alan Vollmer, both have ambitions of a greener future for generations to come. We notice wasteful practices, and a severe lack in sustainable infrastructure all around us every day. More specifically, we've come to recognize the void of agricultural knowledge among children born into the digital era, especially those living in urban areas. </p>
<p>We think the best way to revitalize earth-consciousness is to collaborate with their school teachers, and develop an agricultural learning experience that caters to the needs expressed by their academic advisors. To do this, we've developed a mobile greenhouse capable of being easily transported to, from, and around schools and other areas throughout Richmond.</p>
<p>As accessibility to fresh food seems to be a common major issue in most urban settings, we believe this product could even become a sustainable solution that will help combat food deserts once we can scale up our operations.</p>
<p>And that's where you all fit into this.</p>
<p>We are calling on the good faith of our community to make this program a reality. We've developed one prototype for a proof of our concept. So far, schools love it. <strong>Binford Middle School and Patrick Henry School of Science &amp; Arts want to partner with us!</strong> However, we have met the limit of our development budget and now we are at a standstill until more sufficient funding starts to come through. We want wheel more of these things out all across Richmond, and we want to perfect our design in the process. We're finally in a great spot to make this thing happen.</p>

<h3>Our Immediate Goal</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To make this happen, we want to develop five complete mobile greenhouses (this includes the GreenWheelBarrow and the detachable greenhouse) over the next couple months.</p>
<p>Our first prototype turned out great! But we're perfectionists and want to keep making tweaks until everyone thinks our design is flawless. </p>
<p>To meet our next milestone, we're setting a fundraising goal of $10,000 over the span of two months. This will be enough to entirely cover the development, experimentation, and material cost of five mobile greenhouses.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal by that set time, all of our backers will be refunded their money and our project will not commence as expected. Tragic.. but true. </p>

A vast country with a low population, much of it is a wilderness, host to boreal forests spanning to the Arctic Circle, Acadian forests at its eastern Maritime and southern temperate regions, and rainforests along the British Columbian coast. The forest seems to go on forever, endless and beautiful.<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444131592/bzivessnd2qpyihmz1ug.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If only it were so.</p>
<p>Over the last two decades Canada has devolved to be the world's leading deforestation nation. Loggers in British Columbia push into protected old growth rainforest and even attempted to clear cut the ancient trees of near legendary scale at Castle Grove on Vancouver Island. The huge province of Ontario has less than .07% forest over one hundred twenty years of age remaining in any accessible southern region, yet loggers have pushed heavily into what little remains, going after the Temagami and anything else they can reach by road or water. In the Atlantic provinces, there is virtually no old growth forest remaining. Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have less than 1% of their original Acadian forests, and while New Brunswick sports a bit more, it is under constant threat. Indeed, in the past twenty years, a quiet environmental holocaust has begun in the Maritime provinces, with government consistently catering to the demands of Big Industry for wood pulp and more recently for the biofuel fiasco.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444131692/m9bcbwkbg5th7qiktnuq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Mills like Northern Pulp, in Pictou County, Nova Scotia, are operated by parent corporations such as Asia-based Paper Excellence, a company with a substantial history of environmental abuse around the world. To feed the pulp mill, the forests of the region are being cut at an impossible-to-sustain rate in order to satisfy investors' desire for cheap pulp and easy profit. No one outside the mill can say quite for certain exactly what the market is for this pulp, though suspected uses range from paper to pelletized fuel for overseas power plants.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444131754/nwgbxjexslbomcup1bgw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The demands of the pulp mills alone were unsustainable. In December, 2014, retired Natural Resources biologist Robert Bancroft wrote in Halifax's Chronicle-Herald that the government is turning Nova Scotia forests into an over-harvested pulp farm. But about that time, other forces of Big Industry--operating behind closed doors--created the biomass power plan. The idea they pandered was that the forests of Atlantic Canada could be cut and burned to produce cheap power. A great deal of backroom dealing went on between Big Industry and political circles, conservation science was dismissed, and ultimately the Nova Scotia government bought into this idea, allowing biomass companies to raze forests to the ground for a mere $8 and change per ton of wood fiber.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444131833/nop4sh0f3ylqaarrpxoy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Not a decade ago, the world tried an experiment: turning crops into oil for cars and industry.  Ecologists had long warned the biofuel experiment would end in failure. And that it did, and hugely so.  Earth's thin zone of topsoil could not possibly produce energy sufficient to feed the population while also powering cars and heavy machinery. The biofuel experiment caused food prices to skyrocket globally, and most adversely affected the poor who already could barely afford to eat, as well as decimating land that served as major carbon sinks, i.e., encouraging clearing of rainforest for room to grow cheap biofuel crops.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia's biomass experiment will burn the forest itself to run major power plants, and it is resulting in the same fiasco. The thin biosphere of topsoil cannot possibly regenerate the forest faster than it is destroyed. And though vast swaths of woodlands have been razed right down to the roots in the ground in an attempt to get every last bit of burnable material, the hunger of the power plants is insatiable. Last year, investigative reporters learned the biomass plants had quietly been importing some 25% of their timber to feed their impossible demands.</p>

<p>The forest of Canada stretches far and wide. Canadians live with it and tend to see it as an immutable part of life. Beyond their cities they have a distant awareness of a vast expanse of green. They drive highways and byways and see it rising on either side of the road. It is a comforting sight, that beautiful wood that seems to go on forever.</p>
<p>But it doesn't, and that it seems unscathed is a carefully orchestrated deception. No place that can be reached by road or water is safe from the depredations of loggers in service of Big Industrys' pulp mills and biomass power schemes. Most anywhere you travel, just beyond sight and hidden by cleverly placed cosmetic hedges, are devastated forests, cut to the ground. Other clear cuts--more than you can possibly imagine--have turned back country, highlands and any place else off the beaten path into a patchwork of dead fields of jagged stumps, hidden by thin hedges of trees left to hide the environmental holocaust. But when companies get reputations for environmental abuse, it hurts public perception, and that hurts investment, so Big Industry has learned to avoid public outcry by keeping its activities on the down low.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of challenges in creating such a documentary. Many of the woodcutting sites are difficult to reach. Documenting the destruction of these forests will require a considerable amount of time in the bush getting through challenging terrain. It will wear on both people and equipment. But the biggest problem point will be Maritime Canada's fickle weather. It can rain for weeks at a time, turning back roads and trails into impassable muck. At most, that will only somewhat slow the progress of this documentary. Those involved in the making of this documentary have many years of experience in back country, and we'll manage despite whatever the weather throws at us. It is possible we'll meet up with hostile persons. Canada has a long history of opposing environmentalists, to the point the RCMP has even tried to frame dirty oil protesters ( <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/rcmp-bombed-oil-site-in-dirty-tricks-campaign-1.188599"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cbc.ca/news/canada/rcmp-bombed-oil-site-in-dirty-tricks-campaign-1.188599</a> ), but the risk is manageable and barring locking us in a cage forever, the documentary will still be made. I've been involved in environmental issues for a long time, and I've developed an incredibly hard head.</p>
<p>The other great challenge to the production of this video is Canada's long history of political and Big Industry opacity. Back scratching and backroom dealing are common. Burying information is almost a time-honored tradition. Fortunately, we have good resources to help us navigate the the obfuscating white noise of corruption and get to the heart of the matter.</p>

</div></div>","Canada is geographically the second largest nation in the world. A vast country with a low population, much of it is a wilderness, host to boreal forests spanning to the Arctic Circle, Acadian forests at its eastern Maritime and southern temperate regions, and rainforests along the British Columbian coast. The forest seems to go on forever, endless and beautiful.

If only it were so.
Over the last two decades Canada has devolved to be the world's leading deforestation nation. Loggers in British Columbia push into protected old growth rainforest and even attempted to clear cut the ancient trees of near legendary scale at Castle Grove on Vancouver Island. The huge province of Ontario has less than .07% forest over one hundred twenty years of age remaining in any accessible southern region, yet loggers have pushed heavily into what little remains, going after the Temagami and anything else they can reach by road or water. In the Atlantic provinces, there is virtually no old growth forest remaining. Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have less than 1% of their original Acadian forests, and while New Brunswick sports a bit more, it is under constant threat. Indeed, in the past twenty years, a quiet environmental holocaust has begun in the Maritime provinces, with government consistently catering to the demands of Big Industry for wood pulp and more recently for the biofuel fiasco.

Mills like Northern Pulp, in Pictou County, Nova Scotia, are operated by parent corporations such as Asia-based Paper Excellence, a company with a substantial history of environmental abuse around the world. To feed the pulp mill, the forests of the region are being cut at an impossible-to-sustain rate in order to satisfy investors' desire for cheap pulp and easy profit. No one outside the mill can say quite for certain exactly what the market is for this pulp, though suspected uses range from paper to pelletized fuel for overseas power plants.

The demands of the pulp mills alone were unsustainable. In December, 2014, retired Natural Resources biologist Robert Bancroft wrote in Halifax's Chronicle-Herald that the government is turning Nova Scotia forests into an over-harvested pulp farm. But about that time, other forces of Big Industry--operating behind closed doors--created the biomass power plan. The idea they pandered was that the forests of Atlantic Canada could be cut and burned to produce cheap power. A great deal of backroom dealing went on between Big Industry and political circles, conservation science was dismissed, and ultimately the Nova Scotia government bought into this idea, allowing biomass companies to raze forests to the ground for a mere $8 and change per ton of wood fiber.


Not a decade ago, the world tried an experiment: turning crops into oil for cars and industry.  Ecologists had long warned the biofuel experiment would end in failure. And that it did, and hugely so.  Earth's thin zone of topsoil could not possibly produce energy sufficient to feed the population while also powering cars and heavy machinery. The biofuel experiment caused food prices to skyrocket globally, and most adversely affected the poor who already could barely afford to eat, as well as decimating land that served as major carbon sinks, i.e., encouraging clearing of rainforest for room to grow cheap biofuel crops.
Nova Scotia's biomass experiment will burn the forest itself to run major power plants, and it is resulting in the same fiasco. The thin biosphere of topsoil cannot possibly regenerate the forest faster than it is destroyed. And though vast swaths of woodlands have been razed right down to the roots in the ground in an attempt to get every last bit of burnable material, the hunger of the power plants is insatiable. Last year, investigative reporters learned the biomass plants had quietly been importing some 25% of their timber to feed their impossible demands.


The forest of Canada stretches far and wide. Canadians live with it and tend to see it as an immutable part of life. Beyond their cities they have a distant awareness of a vast expanse of green. They drive highways and byways and see it rising on either side of the road. It is a comforting sight, that beautiful wood that seems to go on forever.
But it doesn't, and that it seems unscathed is a carefully orchestrated deception. No place that can be reached by road or water is safe from the depredations of loggers in service of Big Industrys' pulp mills and biomass power schemes. Most anywhere you travel, just beyond sight and hidden by cleverly placed cosmetic hedges, are devastated forests, cut to the ground. Other clear cuts--more than you can possibly imagine--have turned back country, highlands and any place else off the beaten path into a patchwork of dead fields of jagged stumps, hidden by thin hedges of trees left to hide the environmental holocaust. But when companies get reputations for environmental abuse, it hurts public perception, and that hurts investment, so Big Industry has learned to avoid public outcry by keeping its activities on the down low.

This documentary in the making will tell the story of Canada's beleaguered forest. Focusing especially on the damage done to the unique Acadian woodlands of the eastern provinces, a genetically rich region where temperate and boreal biomes meet, we will explore the hidden damage Big Industry doesn't want you to see or know about. We will delve into a decade of backroom deals that have allowed an ecological holocaust in Canada's three Maritime provinces. And we will explore the dirty politics that have been used to silence the scientists, naturalists and environmentalists who would speak out against this.
This will be the untold story of Canada's forests under siege.

What We Need & What You Get
 

Funds raised will provide travel and production costs to obtain on-site footage and interviews, as well as post production costs to create and master the documentary, and any fees necessary for archived footage or music bites.

A number of unique perks are available to donors.  Signed copies of Cliff Seruntine's popular books on the spirit and joy of living well with nature, Seasons of the Sacred Earth and The Wildwood Way, are available, along with limited edition art, production T-shirts and opportunities to appear in the credits.
This campaign is flex funded, meaning if the full goal is not reached, those funds raised will go toward the making of the documentary.  Canada is in the midst of an environmental holocaust--the worst deforesting nation in the world and the leading polluter among G-20 nations--and we are committed to bringing this to light.  We will launch new fund raisers, pursue grants, and do whatever is necessary to inform the world about Canada's quiet environmental holocaust.
    The Impact The environmental holocaust can only occur because it is kept on the down low.  News of it appears here and there in the media, but no one has put together all the pieces.  Government downplays it.  Canada's current PM has established a reputation for suppressing scientists and interfering with the work of environmental investigators.  And government and business have become adept at obfuscating the facts.  It is our hope to let the world know, to make people angry, and incite people to work toward change.  But that all starts with telling the real story . . .

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In order to protect the island, we need the general public to be aware of it. This awareness promotes stewardship, and this in turn promotes environmental caring, preservation and conservation. Hinchinbrook Island is a part of the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef and is adjacent to Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. It has an extremely high diversity with mountains, rivers, waterfalls, mangroves, beaches all with rare and endangered species such as the irrawaddy dolphin, mahogany glider or ground orchids. 2kms offshore are some of the largest and presumably oldest corals found anywhere on earth. We need more global awareness.</p>
<p>Our charter is to offer an island escape for everyone and support charitable causes. In building a low cost glamping style retreat we will make this affordable to the general public and provide accessibility for everyone. We aim to fund holidays for families with special needs adults in other states which have nothing like Hinchinbrook. We also hope to offer the local community significantly discounted pricing in the low season which is during the summer break, we are in discussions with council regarding this.</p>
<p>In building a centre of excellence for environmental studies we hope that we can have an impact on introduced pests such as the cane toad. If we can find a solution on Hinchinbrook, perhaps the island can save Australia from this plague.</p>
<p>There are many modern applications that we can introduce with our guests such as PlantSnap, FishTag and FrogID. There are so many species that will not be documented on these apps that it will be a veritable treasure hunt!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Forests are home to 80 percent of the world’s terrestrial species of plants, animals, and insects. And 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood, including 70 million indigenous people. Forests supply water, mitigate climate change, and are essential for sustainable food production. Yet deforestation and forest degradation continue at alarming rates. Between 2015 and 2020, the rate of deforestation was estimated at 10 million hectares per year. And the area of primary forest worldwide has decreased by over 80 million hectares since 1990.</p>
<p>This month, Indiegogo donated $6,800 to support reforestation efforts to help make our planet a little greener, literally. The planet wouldn’t be able to survive without our forests, which is why we are excited to choose two incredible organizations dedicated to deforestation as part of our ongoing promise to support causes that matter to the Indiegogo community.</p>
<p>We want to thank the Indiegogo community for allowing us to make a difference and support causes that help the greater good. Last year, Indiegogo launched Tips for Indiegogo, a feature that allows backers to add a small additional donation to their campaign contributions. Indiegogo donates a portion of the money raised from Tips to important causes that need immediate attention. Earlier this year, Indiegogo donated $17,000 to the Asian Americans Advancing Justice – Asian Law Caucus, and we also donated 100% of the revenue raised from our March 15, 2021 newsletter to Stop AAPI Hate.</p>
<p>Supporting Reforestation</p>
<p>Since our inception, helping the planet has been a prime concern for Indiegogo backers and campaigners. Hundreds of ideas that aim to protect the planet have found their home on Indiegogo’s platform, and reforestation efforts are crucial to keeping our planet habitable. On September 15, 2021, we donated a total of $7K to the following 2 organizations to support reforestation:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632476287/isupvgguufoi4xwwbvc9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>One Tree Planted, a non-profit organization focused on global reforestation. Their mission is to make it simple for anyone to help the environment by planting trees. Indiegogo’s donation of $1,800 will be put into the reforestation efforts in North America, Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Pacific. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632476348/zdsnnwfelxhtvlntbfjf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>American Forest Foundation, a non-profit organization that works on-the-ground with families, teachers, and elected officials to promote stewardship and protect the forest heritage of the United States. Indiegogo’s donation of $5K will help deliver meaningful conservation impact through the empowerment of family forest landowners. </p>
<p>Green Campaigns on Indiegogo</p>
<p>Indiegogo has been home to hundreds of innovative projects that protect the planet. Green projects like at-home composters, solar powered generators, and accessible eBikes have all found funding on Indiegogo. </p>
<p>Check out these green campaigns that are currently live on Indiegogo:</p>
<div></div>
<p>Lomi: Turn Waste To Compost With A Single Button</p>
<p>Lomi makes it simple to turn your food scraps, organic waste, and compostable packaging into compost. It can even break down bioplastic into compost that’s safe to use in your garden, which is what sets this home composter apart. Simply put in your garbage, press a button, and out comes nutrient-rich compost for your plants. </p>

<p>The Briiv Air Filter: Unlock the Power of Plants</p>
<p>Air pollution is linked to an increased risk of respiratory conditions, including asthma and even lung cancer. Meet Briiv. As the world’s most sustainable air purifier, Briiv works to remove pollutants from your home to help you live, work and breathe healthier, happier, and safer lives.</p>

I have always loved gardening and taking care of living things, ever since i was a kid living in Missouri. I also love good food and care deeply for our planet. I went to college for zoo keeping so that I could learn more about animals and how to care for the more exotic ones. My greatest motivation is that I want my newborn son to be able to have a healthier planet to live on and flourish.<p> </p>
<p>        My campaign is called the Sustainable Ag Project, I started it so that i could open a commercial size greenhouse so that I can grow tropical fruits here in Colorado. Growing fruit from the tropic regions here in Colorado would reduce the distance they have to ravel, it would also allow people to see the process of growing them and educate them on why sustainable farming practices are important, and why they should grow locally. One of my biggest personal goals for my project is to show people that there are other ways to do things, that they can themselves make this world a better place with a brighter future for all.</p>
<p>        You the contributors will be able to help get this business started, if i get the funding not only will I be starting this greenhouse, I will be using the profits from it to open more and more, so that one day every city will have one, that is my goal. They will be bigger and better with each one created. All of you, can help me achieve these lofty goals, this project of mine had the potential to change how things are done.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>           As far as funding is concerned I set the goal to ten million, I can do the project for much less but such a high goal will help pay for higher quality materials and a faster construction time. I know its a lot of money, but I believe firmly that people will see it as a worthy cause and help with whatever they can.</p>
<p>               The perks for donating will be very variable, they range from a basket of high quality fruit all the way to having a personal tour of the place and lunch with me, maybe even let you help plan the future of the business and at the very least let ALL who donate have input on future expansions/business ideas.</p>
<p>              If I do not reach my entire goal, the funds will be used to at least start construction and get things going. I can at the very least downscale the facility to ensure that it does get built and start producing, then work on expanding it and adding new areas over time.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>             My project if completed, will have a big impact on the world. Everyone's eyes will be opened up to new ways to do things and new ideas for ways to improve how our food is grown. The possibilities for improvement upon our current agricultural model are huge, and if my project is completed, businesses throughout the world would see that new ways of producing goods can catch on and effect not only the quality of peoples lives, but also the planets health.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>             There are of course risks, and challenges just like every other endeavor. The greatest of which is finding suitable land for the project, Colorado has lots of hills and uneven land, ideally I would want a flat site that does not require heavy machinery to smooth it down. The second part of finding the land is that I believe something in the city would be best for visibility and awareness of the business.</p>

<p>My name is John Magiro and I built a mini hydropower station from scratch for my village in Murang’a, Kenya. I have set up this fundraiser page to help me achieve my next goal which is to build another hydropower station in the next small village that is still without electricity.</p>
<p>My project seeks to empower the local communities to have better living conditions by increasing their opportunities for making productive economic investments while promoting a culture that uses eco-friendly power. To date, I have connected 350 households in my village to electricity. But this is not enough; there are many more households that still use lantern lamps for their lighting. These people live below the poverty line and therefore cannot afford to seek other alternatives. However, I do not have the funds to reach them all.  </p>
<p>It is for this reason that I appeal to you, seeking your help to transform the lives of those living in Murang’a and Kenya at large. I want to scale up my project to reach an additional 200 households (1,000 people) and also commence the construction of the next mini hydropower station. It is in this regard that am asking for your help in raising USD 150,000. This will be used to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boost current production capacity to reach more homes</li>
<li>Purchase necessary equipment and machinery</li>
<li>Purchase and install power poles to reach 200 households</li>
<li>Purchase and install power cable lines to reach 200 households</li>
<li>Purchase safety gear for the Magiro team</li>
<li>Set up a new power plant in a neighbouring village</li>
</ol>
<p>My desire is to see each and every household lit up with clean, reliable and affordable energy. I want to see a world where even the rural poor are empowered to alter their realities. I want to see children read at night. I do not want to see trees cut and women and girls walk long distances in search of wood fuel. I want to see my village look like the big towns. I desire a world where energy poverty gap is so minimal it cannot form a statistic anymore. But to achieve this, I need your help.</p>
<p>I alone cannot change the world. Change will not come if we wait for some other person, or if we wait for some other time. We are the change that we seek and we must make our little footing in making the world a better place. I am already more than grateful for the support you have granted me so far, for I know, together we can change this world.

<h3>Short Summary                   </h3>
<p>Niger Delta mangroves, the most biodiverse of all ecosystems and the best carbon storage available on the planet, are being destroyed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585919222/mingzqfhajzizrgkvocq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>However, there exist people willing to restore it, planting the new seedlings. Young <strong>volunteers </strong>from close villages, they have the will, but lack food to be able to work.  The goal is to plant <strong>100,000 mangrove trees </strong>in the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve in the south of the Akwa Ibom region. 2,000 trees have already been planted. </p>
<p>One hundred volunteers are organized in a local <strong>Tropical Research Conservation Center (TRCC)</strong>. Between Czech innovator <strong>myELEN.com</strong> and TRCC, we developed a donation-barter system, the <strong>Food for Mangroves Adoption System</strong>, providing meals to volunteers through targeted micro-donations. The system permits to trace every dollar - and link it to planted mangrove seedlings.</p>
<p>The donor finances food to hardworking mangrove saviors and receives a report on the number and placement of mangrove seedlings. <br/><br/>Currently, we count with 100 young volunteers who participate in the plantation of mangroves. If we support them with food, large surfaces of mangroves will be restored. </p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>•        Every <strong>2 EUR</strong> will translate in a <strong>meal for a volunteer</strong> - responsible for the plantation of 15 seedlings. A mangrove tree absorbs an average of 12.3  kgCO2/year for the West Africa region (Donato et al., 2011). Thus, 4 EUR will help to capture <strong>360 kg CO2/year.</strong></p>
<p>•        For 4 EUR of support, each volunteer will plant approximately 30 mangrove trees per day. </p>
<p>•        If you would support 1 volunteer for 1 month of mangrove plantation, it would lead to the absorption of more than 7,400 kg CO2 per year. </p>
<p>•        The purchase of meals provided for volunteers will be coordinated by TRCC and will be produced by local suppliers. The guarantor and supervisor of local operations will be TRCC.</p>
<p>•         The meals will be nutritive, produced locally in systems with sustainable practices. Thus, we support the virtuous circle of consumption. </p>
<p>•        The information channel and coordinator of information to donors will be myELEN.com.  Every donor will be informed on the use of the donation per email / on the internet wall. </p>
<p>•        Production of food for self-consumption by small farmers in rural areas of the Niger Delta will make them secure mangroves rather than exploiting them in an unsustainable way. <strong>The volunteering work will be empowered by good meals. </strong></p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>•         Reaching the goal of supporting 1 TRCC volunteer with 1 month of his food = 7,400 kg CO2</p>
<p>•         The benefitted region will be the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve (SCFR) in Akwa Ibom State, Niger Delta Region of Nigeria in communities Eket, Esit Eket, Onna, Ibiono.</p>
<p>•        Restoration of mangroves will recreate habitat for fish, crustaceans, sponges, algae, mammals, aquatic birds, reptiles, and endangered species such as pygmy hippopotamus (<i>Choeropsis liberiensis</i>), manatees (<i>Trichechus senegalensis</i>), crocodiles (<i>Crocodylus niloticus</i>), or white-throated monkey (<i>Cercopithecus erythrogaster</i>) and many others. </p>
<p>•        Mangroves regulate local ecosystem processes such as <strong>blue carbon sink,</strong> water depuration, and protection against hurricanes, among others. It hosts <strong>high biodiversity</strong> for being a wetland in the transition of terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems. </p>
<p>•         We need to put to work a mechanism able to transform targeted micro-donations into meals - and trace them efficiently - make this a massive channel. The creation of the food adoption system on a credible and efficient level can lead to the formation of a channel of support to other organizations.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are risks related to this reforestation project.</p>
<p>•        The area may be affected by tropical cyclones.</p>
<p>•        Political instability can affect the restoration of mangroves and can affect the local                            organization. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute with donations, but that doesn't mean they can't help. </p>
<p>It would be of great help if you <strong>share this campaign</strong> on <strong>social media </strong>with your family, friends, colleagues, or anyone that has an interest in environmental and social issues. Ask folks to get the word out and make noise about our campaign.</p>
<p>We also need volunteers of all kinds, as well as distributors who can distribute sustainable products. Just write us to <u>info@myelen.com</u> and let us seek a way how can we collaborate. </p>

<h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
<p>We believe that supporting the proactivity of individuals gives them a lifetime chance. We believe that the prosperity of individuals leads to the prosperity of the whole society. We believe that <strong>small amounts </strong>can make a <strong>big difference</strong>. We believe that every single one of us has the power to make a <strong>positive impact</strong> in this world.</p>
<p>With time being such a coveted commodity in the fight against <strong>Climate Change</strong> and the global ecological depletion, <strong>wise investments</strong> (be it time, money or skills) need to be channeled correctly for the most beneficial (sustainable) output. In line with our values, in myelen.com we offer a clear way of channeling money without bluffing or empty promises.</p>
<p>What is needed to recreate mangroves is just to organize a few euros for food  - isn't it a wise action to do? More so, if that could become an example for other similar actions. </p>

<h3>Technical / Additional Characteristics </h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Type of mangrove to be planted</strong></p>
<p>Red mangroves, <i>Rhizophora</i>, known as “ the true mangrove"".  The Red mangrove (<i>Rhizophora</i> mangle) is the tallest of all mangrove species. It grows as high as 80 feet (25m). The wood of the trunk has a high density, making it attractive for industrial use. During the life of a <i>Rhizophora</i> mangle tree, the stem can reach a diameter of 20 to 50cm. It has large broad leaves grow to 5 inches (12cm) and terminate with a blunt point. The leaves are waxy, dark green above and pale green below. The trunk and limbs have grey bark that covers a dark redwood and with oblong or oval-shaped leaves.

<p><strong>Tipo de manglar a plantar </strong></p>
<p>Manglares rojos, <i>Rhizophora</i>, conocido como ""el manglar verdadero"".  El manglar rojo (<i>Rhizophora</i>) es el más grande de todas las especies de manglares. Crece hasta 80 pies (25m) y la madera del tronco tiene una alta densidad, por lo que es atractiva para el uso industrial y para captura de CO2.</p>
<p>Durante la vida de un árbol de <i>Rhizophora</i>, el tallo puede alcanzar un diámetro de 20 a 50cm. Tiene grandes hojas anchas crecen hasta 5 pulgadas (12cm), terminan en punta redonda y son hojas brillantes, de color verde oscuro por encima y verde pálido por debajo. El tronco y las extremidades tienen una corteza gris que cubre una madera roja oscura y con hojas oblongas u ovaladas. La cubierta sirve de hábitat para muchos animales arbóreos, especialmente aves, ardillas, pottos (lémures africanos) y monos.</p>
<p><strong>Tipo de árboles multipropósitos/frutales que crecen en zonas de manglares </strong></p>
<p>Nuez de cola (<i>Cola nitida</i>), cola amarga (<i>Garcinia kola</i>), mango silvestre (<i>Irvingia gabonensis</i>), fruta de pan africana (<i>Treculia africana</i>), árbol de aceite de haba (<i>Pentaclethra macrophyllal</i>) manzana estrellada (<i>Chrysophyllum albidum</i>), pera africana, (<i>Dacryodes edulis</i>) y la algarroba africana (<i>Parkia clappertoniana</i>).<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Densidad y distribución de plantaciones de manglares y árboles frutales</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>200 manglares por hectárea para la zona de manglares</li>
<li>100 árboles por hectárea para la zona de los árboles multiusos/frutales.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Propagación y manejo de manglares </strong></p>
<p>El manglar rojo crece en árboles grandes entre dos a tres años. Los manglares se propagan principalmente por propágulos y semillas. Las flores se cree que son auto polinizadas o polinizadas por el viento. Después de la polinización, los propágulos de los manglares experimentan un desarrollo continuo de flor a plántula germinada. Las plántulas o propágulos se pueden después llevar al vivero para después ser trasplantadas a las zonas de reforestación.</p>
<p><strong>Plan de reforestación</strong></p>
<p>El objetivo es la plantación de 100.000 manglares y 20.000 árboles siendo el tamaño total de la superficie forestal de 10.000 hectáreas. La reforestación se llevará a cabo principalmente en lugares muy desgastados dentro del bosque (700 hectáreas aproximadamente).</p>
<p>Las porciones menos degradadas se dejarán para su restauración por sucesión ecológica. El proyecto ayudará a conservar toda la superficie forestal, evitando una mayor degradación. El área de reforestación está situada entre las latitudes 4032' N y 40 38'N y las longitudes 7054'E y 8018'E, y se encuentra en el extremo sur del estado de Akwa Ibom, que se extiende desde Enwang hasta James Town.</p>
<p>Forma una zona de amortiguamiento entre la costa atlántica y ecosistemas de tierra firme. La vegetación es un mosaico de una selva tropical de tierras bajas y un bosque de pantanos de manglares. En el estado de Akwa Ibom, Stubbs Creek representa el único bosque de pantanos costeros naturales de tamaño significativo restante (Ohimain, 2003; Omo-Irabor et al., 2011). Hay 39 aldeas o asentamientos en las cuatro comunidades circundantes (Eket, Esit Eket, Ibeno y Mbo) que obtienen muchos beneficios del bosque.</p>

Short Summary                   
Niger Delta mangroves, the most biodiverse of all ecosystems and the best carbon storage available on the planet, are being destroyed.

However, there exist people willing to restore it, planting the new seedlings. Young volunteers from close villages, they have the will, but lack food to be able to work.  The goal is to plant 100,000 mangrove trees in the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve in the south of the Akwa Ibom region. 2,000 trees have already been planted. 
One hundred volunteers are organized in a local Tropical Research Conservation Center (TRCC). Between Czech innovator myELEN.com and TRCC, we developed a donation-barter system, the Food for Mangroves Adoption System, providing meals to volunteers through targeted micro-donations. The system permits to trace every dollar - and link it to planted mangrove seedlings.
The donor finances food to hardworking mangrove saviors and receives a report on the number and placement of mangrove seedlings. Currently, we count with 100 young volunteers who participate in the plantation of mangroves. If we support them with food, large surfaces of mangroves will be restored. 
 


 
What We Need & What You Get
•        Every 2 EUR will translate in a meal for a volunteer - responsible for the plantation of 15 seedlings. A mangrove tree absorbs an average of 12.3  kgCO2/year for the West Africa region (Donato et al., 2011). Thus, 4 EUR will help to capture 360 kg CO2/year.
•        For 4 EUR of support, each volunteer will plant approximately 30 mangrove trees per day. 
•        If you would support 1 volunteer for 1 month of mangrove plantation, it would lead to the absorption of more than 7,400 kg CO2 per year. 
•        The purchase of meals provided for volunteers will be coordinated by TRCC and will be produced by local suppliers. The guarantor and supervisor of local operations will be TRCC.
•         The meals will be nutritive, produced locally in systems with sustainable practices. Thus, we support the virtuous circle of consumption. 
•        The information channel and coordinator of information to donors will be myELEN.com.  Every donor will be informed on the use of the donation per email / on the internet wall. 
•        Production of food for self-consumption by small farmers in rural areas of the Niger Delta will make them secure mangroves rather than exploiting them in an unsustainable way. The volunteering work will be empowered by good meals. 

 

The Impact
•         Reaching the goal of supporting 1 TRCC volunteer with 1 month of his food = 7,400 kg CO2
•         The benefitted region will be the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve (SCFR) in Akwa Ibom State, Niger Delta Region of Nigeria in communities Eket, Esit Eket, Onna, Ibiono.
•        Restoration of mangroves will recreate habitat for fish, crustaceans, sponges, algae, mammals, aquatic birds, reptiles, and endangered species such as pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis), manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), or white-throated monkey (Cercopithecus erythrogaster) and many others. 
•        Mangroves regulate local ecosystem processes such as blue carbon sink, water depuration, and protection against hurricanes, among others. It hosts high biodiversity for being a wetland in the transition of terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems. 
•         We need to put to work a mechanism able to transform targeted micro-donations into meals - and trace them efficiently - make this a massive channel. The creation of the food adoption system on a credible and efficient level can lead to the formation of a channel of support to other organizations.  
 


 
Meet some of the volunteers

Edikan, Bassey, and Charles volunteer for the plantation of new mangroves in degraded areas of the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve (SCFR). They work 3 days per week, Your support will encourage them to keep doing this noble action that brings development to their communities.  
Risks & Challenges
There are risks related to this reforestation project.
•        The area may be affected by tropical cyclones.
•        Political instability can affect the restoration of mangroves and can affect the local                            organization. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute with donations, but that doesn't mean they can't help. 
It would be of great help if you share this campaign on social media with your family, friends, colleagues, or anyone that has an interest in environmental and social issues. Ask folks to get the word out and make noise about our campaign.
We also need volunteers of all kinds, as well as distributors who can distribute sustainable products. Just write us to info@myelen.com and let us seek a way how can we collaborate. 
 

 
Why do we do this?
We believe that supporting the proactivity of individuals gives them a lifetime chance. We believe that the prosperity of individuals leads to the prosperity of the whole society. We believe that small amounts can make a big difference. We believe that every single one of us has the power to make a positive impact in this world.
With time being such a coveted commodity in the fight against Climate Change and the global ecological depletion, wise investments (be it time, money or skills) need to be channeled correctly for the most beneficial (sustainable) output. In line with our values, in myelen.com we offer a clear way of channeling money without bluffing or empty promises.
What is needed to recreate mangroves is just to organize a few euros for food  - isn't it a wise action to do? More so, if that could become an example for other similar actions. 
 

 
Technical / Additional Characteristics 

Type of mangrove to be planted
Red mangroves, Rhizophora, known as “ the true mangrove"".  The Red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) is the tallest of all mangrove species. It grows as high as 80 feet (25m). The wood of the trunk has a high density, making it attractive for industrial use. During the life of a Rhizophora mangle tree, the stem can reach a diameter of 20 to 50cm. It has large broad leaves grow to 5 inches (12cm) and terminate with a blunt point. The leaves are waxy, dark green above and pale green below. The trunk and limbs have grey bark that covers a dark redwood and with oblong or oval-shaped leaves. The canopy serves as a habitat for many arboreal animals, especially birds, squirrels, pottos, and monkeys.
Type of multipurpose/fruit  trees growing in mangrove areas
Kola nut (Cola nitida), bitter cola (Garcinia kola), wild mango (Irvingia gabonensis), african breadfruit (Treculia africana), oil bean tree (Pentaclethra macrophyllaI) star apple (Chrysophyllum albidum), african pear, (Dacryodes edulis) and locust bean tree (Paria clappertoniana).Density and distribution of plantation of mangrove and multipurpose trees
• 200 mangroves trees per hectare for mangroves
• 100 trees per hectare for the multi-purpose/fruit trees.
The life cycle of mangrove The mangrove grows into tall trees within two to three years, mainly propagated by propagules. The flowers are thought to be self-pollinated or wind-pollinated. Following the pollination, mangrove seeds undergo continuous development from flower to germinated seedling when it is still attached to the mangrove tree. The seedlings or propagules can then be collected for nursery and transplanting.
Reforestation plan
The objective is 100,000 mangrove stands and 20,000 multipurpose trees. The entire size of the forest area is 10,000 hectares. The reforestation will mainly be carried out at highly degraded spots within the forest (~700 hectares ). Less degraded portions will be let for natural succession. 
The project will help to conserve the entire forest area, preventing it from further degradation. The plot lies between latitudes 4032’ N and 40 38’N and longitudes 7054’E and 8018’E and is located at the Southern end of the Akwa Ibom State, stretching from Enwang to James Town. It forms a buffer zone between the Atlantic coast and the Akwa Ibom State mainland. The vegetation is a mosaic of a lowland rain forest and mangrove swamp forest. In Akwa Ibom State, Stubbs Creek represents the only remaining natural coastal swamp forest of any significant size  (Ohimain, 2003; Omo-Irabor et al., 2011). There are 39 villages or settlements in the four surrounding communities (Eket, Esit Eket, Ibeno, and Mbo ) that derive many benefits from the forest.

Resumen
Los manglares del Delta del Níger, uno de los ecosistemas más biodiversos y el mejor almacén de carbono disponible en el planeta, está siendo destruido.

Sin embargo, existen personas dispuestas a restaurarlo plantando nuevas semillas. Jóvenes voluntarios de poblados cercanos que tienen la voluntad, pero falta de alimento suficiente para poder trabajar plenamente. La meta es plantar 100,000 manglares en la Reserva Forestal Stubbs Creek en el sur de la región de Akwa Ibom. De los cuales, 2,000 manglares ya han sido plantados.
Cien voluntarios son organizados por el Tropical Research Conservation Center (TRCC, por sus siglas en inglés). Entre el innovador Checo myELEN.com y el TRCC, desarrollamos un sistema de donación-trueque, el Sistema de Adopción de Alimentos para Manglares. Para proveer de alimento a los voluntarios a través de micro donaciones dirigidas. El sistema permite seguir cada euro – y ligarlo a plántulas de manglar plantadas. 
El donante financiará alimentos para rescatistas de manglar muy trabajadores, y recibirán un reporte del número y la ubicación de las plántulas de manglar.
Actualmente, contamos con 100 voluntarios jóvenes que participan en la plantación de manglares. Si los apoyamos con alimentos, se restaurarán grandes superficies de manglar.

Lo que se necesita para restaurar los manglares es sólo reunir unos cuantos euros para alimentos - ¿no es esta una acción inteligente por hacer? Más aún, si eso pudiera convertirse en un ejemplo para otras acciones similares.

 
Características adicionales / técnicas 


Tipo de manglar a plantar 
Manglares rojos, Rhizophora, conocido como ""el manglar verdadero"".  El manglar rojo (Rhizophora) es el más grande de todas las especies de manglares. Crece hasta 80 pies (25m) y la madera del tronco tiene una alta densidad, por lo que es atractiva para el uso industrial y para captura de CO2.
Durante la vida de un árbol de Rhizophora, el tallo puede alcanzar un diámetro de 20 a 50cm. Tiene grandes hojas anchas crecen hasta 5 pulgadas (12cm), terminan en punta redonda y son hojas brillantes, de color verde oscuro por encima y verde pálido por debajo. El tronco y las extremidades tienen una corteza gris que cubre una madera roja oscura y con hojas oblongas u ovaladas. La cubierta sirve de hábitat para muchos animales arbóreos, especialmente aves, ardillas, pottos (lémures africanos) y monos.
Tipo de árboles multipropósitos/frutales que crecen en zonas de manglares 
Nuez de cola (Cola nitida), cola amarga (Garcinia kola), mango silvestre (Irvingia gabonensis), fruta de pan africana (Treculia africana), árbol de aceite de haba (Pentaclethra macrophyllal) manzana estrellada (Chrysophyllum albidum), pera africana, (Dacryodes edulis) y la algarroba africana (Parkia clappertoniana). 
Densidad y distribución de plantaciones de manglares y árboles frutales

200 manglares por hectárea para la zona de manglares
100 árboles por hectárea para la zona de los árboles multiusos/frutales.

Propagación y manejo de manglares 
El manglar rojo crece en árboles grandes entre dos a tres años. Los manglares se propagan principalmente por propágulos y semillas. Las flores se cree que son auto polinizadas o polinizadas por el viento. Después de la polinización, los propágulos de los manglares experimentan un desarrollo continuo de flor a plántula germinada. Las plántulas o propágulos se pueden después llevar al vivero para después ser trasplantadas a las zonas de reforestación.
Plan de reforestación
El objetivo es la plantación de 100.000 manglares y 20.000 árboles siendo el tamaño total de la superficie forestal de 10.000 hectáreas. La reforestación se llevará a cabo principalmente en lugares muy desgastados dentro del bosque (700 hectáreas aproximadamente).
Las porciones menos degradadas se dejarán para su restauración por sucesión ecológica. El proyecto ayudará a conservar toda la superficie forestal, evitando una mayor degradación. El área de reforestación está situada entre las latitudes 4032' N y 40 38'N y las longitudes 7054'E y 8018'E, y se encuentra en el extremo sur del estado de Akwa Ibom, que se extiende desde Enwang hasta James Town.
Forma una zona de amortiguamiento entre la costa atlántica y ecosistemas de tierra firme. La vegetación es un mosaico de una selva tropical de tierras bajas y un bosque de pantanos de manglares. En el estado de Akwa Ibom, Stubbs Creek representa el único bosque de pantanos costeros naturales de tamaño significativo restante (Ohimain, 2003; Omo-Irabor et al., 2011). Hay 39 aldeas o asentamientos en las cuatro comunidades circundantes (Eket, Esit Eket, Ibeno y Mbo) que obtienen muchos beneficios del bosque.

Produced by a professional film crew on board, equipped with top tier visual technology and with the approval of one of the most influential documentary selectors in Croatia, Mr. Đelo Hadžiselimović. Detailed scenery of the expedition, cultural, geographical, and ecological diversities will portrait the current state of the expedition route. Entertaining the lively atmosphere of the crew’s journey will give the films a narrative of an organic story about how the team grows together as the journey goes by. The emotions of the filmed participants, their thoughts, work and reactions will be inscripted and then moulded into a film series which will converge all of the above elements into key proactive statements which will provide its viewers with a valuable asset to take back home. Ultimately inspiring and encouraging the audience to become the awaken citizens of the world, appealing to rethink their current interaction with the environment and its consequences, inspiring to act and live consciously and better aligning their life with the universal values that this project promotes.</p><p><strong>This is where you come in; the international community.

Produced by a professional film crew on board, equipped with top tier visual technology and with the approval of one of the most influential documentary selectors in Croatia, Mr. Đelo Hadžiselimović. Detailed scenery of the expedition, cultural, geographical, and ecological diversities will portrait the current state of the expedition route. Entertaining the lively atmosphere of the crew’s journey will give the films a narrative of an organic story about how the team grows together as the journey goes by. The emotions of the filmed participants, their thoughts, work and reactions will be inscripted and then moulded into a film series which will converge all of the above elements into key proactive statements which will provide its viewers with a valuable asset to take back home. Ultimately inspiring and encouraging the audience to become the awaken citizens of the world, appealing to rethink their current interaction with the environment and its consequences, inspiring to act and live consciously and better aligning their life with the universal values that this project promotes.This is where you come in; the international community.

Penelope Williams, executive chef and owner of Bali Asli, a cooking school and restaurant on the foothills of Mt Agung in East Bali, decided she had to do something. Working alongside the chiefs from the villages surrounding Bali Asli, she’s found a hands-on solution that she believes will inspire the government to take action.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521524508/obohqe7yciy5drqyvkd8.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><h3>What is Bali Asli?</h3><p>Bali Asli, which means “authentic” or “genuine” Bali, is a restaurant with a cooking school located in East Bali near the foothills of Bali’s infamous volcano, Mt Agung.</p><p>Bali Asli came to life in June 2011, with the purpose of not only providing visitors with authentic Balinese cuisine so that they can taste the ‘real’ Bali, but also creating adventures that allow them to see, touch and experience the island’s culture in a way that provides an immersive experience that nourishes the body and the soul, and provides a greater understanding of the Balinese way of life. Penelope Williams, the owner of Bali Asli, found that authentic Balinese cuisine was almost impossible for visitors to the island to access. As a chef who had been living in the region for several years, she had begun to explore the vitality and intricacies of the cusinese and was deeply saddened that people would come to Bali, eat chicken sate with peanut sauce, nasi goreng and mie goreng and think that they had eaten Balinese food. Bali Asli is her way of sharing the soul of Balinese cuisine.</p><p>In keeping with her vision of providing a traditional experience, Penelope constructed Bali Asli to be at one with its environment. An eco-friendly establishment, the building and its underlying concepts use natural materials and traditional Balinese design and has no electrical appliances (everything is made using good old fashioned elbow grease), to ensure minimal impact on the environment.</p><p>Penelope would now like to take this eco-friendly ethos to the wider community, making social change and giving back to the Balinese community a greater extension of Bali Asli’s purpose.</p><h3>Why Bali Asli Needs Your Help</h3><p>As you walk up the dark stone staircase that marks the entrance to Bali Asli and pass through the carved timber doorway at the top, you will find yourself breathless, and not due to the stairs you have just climbed. The long earth-toned restaurant space opens out seamlessly into an expansive deck that overlooks lush green wrinkles of rice paddy fields, while Bali’s most sacred mountain, Mt Agung, rises like a mystical guardian in the distance.</p><p>But beneath the surface of this beauty and tranquility lies a darker underbelly. Bali, the paradise island, is now drowning in its own rubbish. Over her 10 years in Bali, Penelope has witnessed how a lack of rubbish management, education and infrastructure available to the Balinese people, and an increasing influx of tourists, has seen the rivers and oceans increasingly being inundated with waste. When it rains, all the rubbish that is disposed of without care is washed up out of the blocked rivers, drains and roadside gutters onto beaches, roads, footpaths, gardens, parks where children play and further into the ocean.</p><p>The current, “out of sight, out of mind” mantra isn’t working and Bali is in a state of crisis with the island having recently declared a garbage emergency.</p><h3><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521523764/y55ws5qhqouklkc0nbvf.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></h3><h3><strong>The Facts</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Up to 75% of Bali’s garbage is not collected by official services.</li>
<li>There are only five legal garbage dumps on the entire island. Because it is so far to transport waste, 50% of it is dumped.</li>
<li>Makeshift rubbish dumps are everywhere due to poor governance.</li>
<li>Every 24 hours, 15,000 cubic meters of trash is disposed of along Bali’s roadsides and at illegal dump sites, enough to completely fill six Olympic sized swimming pools every day.</li>
<li>Indonesia is the second biggest maritime plastic polluter in the world after China.</li>
</ul><p>Really, this problem is the responsibility of the Indonesian government, just the same as other governments around the world have to take responsibility to educate the population and put in place the infrastructure to support education. But to make this a focus for authorities is a difficult task. There comes a point, when matters have to be taken into our hands as citizens of planet earth in order to inspire change and do the right thing. Just waiting on local government initiatives to take action isn’t the solution especially when things have become so dire.</p><p>Penelope  knows she must do something to help. Something that can help create tangible positive change to Bali’s massive rubbish problem. And she needs your help to do it.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521605725/jmh0pleqglyl0fqgr8jq.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><h3>Starting Locally</h3><p>The rubbish problem in Bali is monumental and Penelope wants to start by first cleaning up her own backyard. The three villages (Gelumpang, Jeruk Manis and Tauka) that surround Bali Asli need support and education to manage their rubbish.</p><p>Currently there is no rubbish collection service provided by the government to collect rubbish from these villages. The people have created a designated area for dumping and then burning the rubbish, and worse - there are additional places where it gets thrown in the river. The schools in these villages comply with the government and try to teach the children about rubbish management and recycling, and most Sundays the school and the children’s family join to clean up the streets. However, like so many other cases, the community doesn’t yet understand that this has to become a way of life.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521609241/ue7uvgaoffwqiwneb2cm.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><h3>Proposed Solution</h3><p><strong>Bali Asli Rubbish Education Program</strong><br/>Penelope will launch the Bali Asli Rubbish Education Program, a sustainable program which focuses on strategies that are based around education, discussion and action. The initiative will work with village chiefs and their communities to get them involved by playing active roles in the scheme. Sturdy rubbish bins will be built in each village with separate sections for organic, non organic and plastic bottles. Cane rubbish baskets will be delivered to every home in the three villages surrounding Bali Asli (Gelumpang, Jeruk Manis and Tauka) and tricycles will be provided to pick up rubbish from these villages’ central bins, and taken to legal refuse centers.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/261098363?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div>
<strong>Bali Asli Eco Refillery</strong><br/>Penelope aims to launch refill stations at local markets across Bali, starting with the local Amlapura market. The ‘refillery’ station will sell shampoo, shower gel, washing liquid and other household goods from bulk purchased containers using recycled refill bottles. The locals would come to these stations with their own bottles (or we will provide them with free bottles) and fill/refill them with whatever daily essentials they require. In doing so, there would be a reduction in the amount of plastic waste created by single portion shampoo and shower gel sachets and single-use plastic bottles. There will also be an incentive program put in place to encourage people to keep re-using their bottles. </div><p>Every purchase will come with an educational pack around sustainable living and 50% of all profit from the refillery will go directly back into the education program to assist in ongoing education.</p><h3><strong>What your contribution will fund</strong></h3><p><strong>Launch Rubbish Education Program<br/>Cost:  </strong>73,900<br/>The program will be launched across the three villages surrounding Bali Asli (Gelumpang, Jeruk Manis and Tauka and will include:</p><ul>
<li>Hiring locals for regular rubbish collection for a period of one year.</li>
<li>Environmental educators for a period of one year.</li>
<li>Buying the rubbish bins and tricycles.</li>
<li>Creating educational packs.</li>
<li>Creating a refreshed website that includes the initiative and online resources.</li>
<li>Marketing collateral including a series of short films that help build awareness around the problem in order to drive change throughout Bali and beyond. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Launch Eco Refillery</strong><br/><strong>Cost: </strong>13,900</p><p>The Refill Station will be launched in Amlapura market and if successful, will be pushed out in markets across Bali.</p><ul>
<li>Initial setup costs for market, including stall rent for 1 year.</li>
<li>Staff salary for 1 year.</li>
<li>Bulk goods including soaps, shampoo, shower gel, dishwashing liquid, clothes washing liquid.</li>
<li>Reusable recycled bags (made from old sarongs and cloth) which will be given out to locals for free to assist them in moving towards a more sustainable future.   </li>
<li>Marketing collateral, to help spread the message.</li>

The next day, venture into Bali’s spiritual heart on a 2.5 hours hike to the top of Lempuyang temple. This sacred journey will wind through misty ancient pandan forests, vanilla vines, native orchids, along a combination of grassy paths lined with lemongrass and steep rocky tracks. Once you reach the summit you are rewarded with breathtaking views overlooking the Karangasem valley to the ocean and across to mighty Mount Agung, Bali’s famous volcano. After a morning coffee and some jajan cakes, you will be taken into the temple where the priest will bless you with holy water collected from the insides of the bamboo growing near the temple. Your descent will be via the 1700 steps, passing many other sacred temples and places of spiritual importance. You will then be taken back to Bali Asli for a well earned megibung lunch, served in the style of the Royal family of Karangasem. In the afternoon, you’ll be able to enjoy some time in a Balinese beauty salon; learn about the healing herbs of Bali, make traditional skin and beauty products from ingredients such as coffee, chocolate, honey, coconut, and exotic flowers, and test them out on yourself or your friend.<br/><i>*Does not include flights or airport transfers. However, Bali Asli would be happy to help you arrange your transfers once you arrive in Bali.</i></p></div>","Short SummaryAt the end of 2017, Bali declared a garbage emergency as the island reached crisis point after struggling to get on top of its rubbish management issues. Penelope Williams, executive chef and owner of Bali Asli, a cooking school and restaurant on the foothills of Mt Agung in East Bali, decided she had to do something. Working alongside the chiefs from the villages surrounding Bali Asli, she’s found a hands-on solution that she believes will inspire the government to take action.What is Bali Asli?Bali Asli, which means “authentic” or “genuine” Bali, is a restaurant with a cooking school located in East Bali near the foothills of Bali’s infamous volcano, Mt Agung.Bali Asli came to life in June 2011, with the purpose of not only providing visitors with authentic Balinese cuisine so that they can taste the ‘real’ Bali, but also creating adventures that allow them to see, touch and experience the island’s culture in a way that provides an immersive experience that nourishes the body and the soul, and provides a greater understanding of the Balinese way of life. Penelope Williams, the owner of Bali Asli, found that authentic Balinese cuisine was almost impossible for visitors to the island to access. As a chef who had been living in the region for several years, she had begun to explore the vitality and intricacies of the cusinese and was deeply saddened that people would come to Bali, eat chicken sate with peanut sauce, nasi goreng and mie goreng and think that they had eaten Balinese food. Bali Asli is her way of sharing the soul of Balinese cuisine.In keeping with her vision of providing a traditional experience, Penelope constructed Bali Asli to be at one with its environment. An eco-friendly establishment, the building and its underlying concepts use natural materials and traditional Balinese design and has no electrical appliances (everything is made using good old fashioned elbow grease), to ensure minimal impact on the environment.Penelope would now like to take this eco-friendly ethos to the wider community, making social change and giving back to the Balinese community a greater extension of Bali Asli’s purpose.Why Bali Asli Needs Your HelpAs you walk up the dark stone staircase that marks the entrance to Bali Asli and pass through the carved timber doorway at the top, you will find yourself breathless, and not due to the stairs you have just climbed. The long earth-toned restaurant space opens out seamlessly into an expansive deck that overlooks lush green wrinkles of rice paddy fields, while Bali’s most sacred mountain, Mt Agung, rises like a mystical guardian in the distance.But beneath the surface of this beauty and tranquility lies a darker underbelly. Bali, the paradise island, is now drowning in its own rubbish. Over her 10 years in Bali, Penelope has witnessed how a lack of rubbish management, education and infrastructure available to the Balinese people, and an increasing influx of tourists, has seen the rivers and oceans increasingly being inundated with waste. When it rains, all the rubbish that is disposed of without care is washed up out of the blocked rivers, drains and roadside gutters onto beaches, roads, footpaths, gardens, parks where children play and further into the ocean.The current, “out of sight, out of mind” mantra isn’t working and Bali is in a state of crisis with the island having recently declared a garbage emergency.The Facts
Up to 75% of Bali’s garbage is not collected by official services.
There are only five legal garbage dumps on the entire island. Because it is so far to transport waste, 50% of it is dumped.
Makeshift rubbish dumps are everywhere due to poor governance.
Every 24 hours, 15,000 cubic meters of trash is disposed of along Bali’s roadsides and at illegal dump sites, enough to completely fill six Olympic sized swimming pools every day.
Indonesia is the second biggest maritime plastic polluter in the world after China.
Really, this problem is the responsibility of the Indonesian government, just the same as other governments around the world have to take responsibility to educate the population and put in place the infrastructure to support education. But to make this a focus for authorities is a difficult task. There comes a point, when matters have to be taken into our hands as citizens of planet earth in order to inspire change and do the right thing. Just waiting on local government initiatives to take action isn’t the solution especially when things have become so dire.Penelope  knows she must do something to help. Something that can help create tangible positive change to Bali’s massive rubbish problem. And she needs your help to do it.Starting LocallyThe rubbish problem in Bali is monumental and Penelope wants to start by first cleaning up her own backyard. The three villages (Gelumpang, Jeruk Manis and Tauka) that surround Bali Asli need support and education to manage their rubbish.Currently there is no rubbish collection service provided by the government to collect rubbish from these villages. The people have created a designated area for dumping and then burning the rubbish, and worse - there are additional places where it gets thrown in the river. The schools in these villages comply with the government and try to teach the children about rubbish management and recycling, and most Sundays the school and the children’s family join to clean up the streets. However, like so many other cases, the community doesn’t yet understand that this has to become a way of life.Proposed SolutionBali Asli Rubbish Education ProgramPenelope will launch the Bali Asli Rubbish Education Program, a sustainable program which focuses on strategies that are based around education, discussion and action. The initiative will work with village chiefs and their communities to get them involved by playing active roles in the scheme. Sturdy rubbish bins will be built in each village with separate sections for organic, non organic and plastic bottles. Cane rubbish baskets will be delivered to every home in the three villages surrounding Bali Asli (Gelumpang, Jeruk Manis and Tauka) and tricycles will be provided to pick up rubbish from these villages’ central bins, and taken to legal refuse centers.
Bali Asli Eco RefilleryPenelope aims to launch refill stations at local markets across Bali, starting with the local Amlapura market. The ‘refillery’ station will sell shampoo, shower gel, washing liquid and other household goods from bulk purchased containers using recycled refill bottles. The locals would come to these stations with their own bottles (or we will provide them with free bottles) and fill/refill them with whatever daily essentials they require. In doing so, there would be a reduction in the amount of plastic waste created by single portion shampoo and shower gel sachets and single-use plastic bottles. There will also be an incentive program put in place to encourage people to keep re-using their bottles. Every purchase will come with an educational pack around sustainable living and 50% of all profit from the refillery will go directly back into the education program to assist in ongoing education.What your contribution will fundLaunch Rubbish Education ProgramCost:  73,900The program will be launched across the three villages surrounding Bali Asli (Gelumpang, Jeruk Manis and Tauka and will include:
Hiring locals for regular rubbish collection for a period of one year.
Environmental educators for a period of one year.
Buying the rubbish bins and tricycles.
Creating educational packs.
Creating a refreshed website that includes the initiative and online resources.
Marketing collateral including a series of short films that help build awareness around the problem in order to drive change throughout Bali and beyond. 
Launch Eco RefilleryCost: 13,900The Refill Station will be launched in Amlapura market and if successful, will be pushed out in markets across Bali.
Initial setup costs for market, including stall rent for 1 year.
Staff salary for 1 year.
Bulk goods including soaps, shampoo, shower gel, dishwashing liquid, clothes washing liquid.
Reusable recycled bags (made from old sarongs and cloth) which will be given out to locals for free to assist them in moving towards a more sustainable future.   
Marketing collateral, to help spread the message.
What We Will Achieve
Over 3,000 locals living in the three villages surrounding Bali Asli are empowered to harness a more sustainable way of living.
Garbage is disposed of sustainably in the three villages surrounding Bali Asli.
Locals and tourists have a more profound appreciation for the land, where a cleaner environment and sustainable living becomes a priority, and a new sense of pride is given to locals.
The Rubbish Education Program is supported by the local Mayor within 12-months and receives financial support to continue the cost of refuse collection, educational resources are boosted and the initiative is widened to cater to the entire island. 
Additional refilleries are launched across Bali that encourage sustainability, create jobs and empower the Balinese people.
A greener, cleaner and healthier Bali for the inhabitants of the region and everyone that visits it.

<h3>What's Better Than Recycling? Letting the Store Refill It! </h3>
<p>Like everyone else, I want to keep my home clean and I use personal care products like shampoo, and like most of us I end up having to buy those products in single-use plastic bottles. I try to recycle but <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/13/702501726/where-will-your-plastic-trash-go-now-that-china-doesnt-want-it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">China</a> doesn't want our plastic recycling anymore. It's piling up, overflowing waste facilities, and being sent to places that aren't prepared to handle it correctly. Plastic garbage is <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/03/18/704471596/stomach-of-dead-whale-contained-nothing-but-plastic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">killing sea mammals</a>, and even ending up in our <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/microplastics#what-they-are"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">food</a>. </p>
<p>I used to wish I could take those plastic bottles back to the store and they would just wash and refill them, so the containers could be used over and over. I wanted to buy the product itself, not another bottle! And, most of all I wanted it to be as fast and convenient as buying a new one off the shelf at the grocery store. That's why we're starting Blue Dot Refillery. </p>
<p>I'm so excited about this opportunity to really change the way we use plastic packaging. If we can get this first Refillery going, refine our model, and show it can be sustained, we could expand the concept to other cities and regions. This would result in keeping millions of tons of plastics out of the waste stream, and has the potential to dramatically revolutionize the way we use packaging for many products. </p>
<p>This is your opportunity to be a part of a brand new retail model that could revolutionize how we think about and use plastic packaging. A business model that <i>makes even more sense than recycling </i>and could result in keeping millions of plastic containers out of the waste stream. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Business Plan</h3>
<p>I worked closely with the local SBA Small Business Development Center to prepare a detailed, solid business plan using conservative estimates to minimize risk. Forecasting moderate sales, our plan showed a consistent growth in profits over three years of projections. If you would like more information about the plan, and our calculations and pro forma projections, you can email me at info@bluedotrefillery.com.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Based on our detailed business plan, we will need about $65,000 to get our first modest Refillery started. That means we need an additional $40,000. If more is donated, we'll be able to start bigger and move faster to stop the flow of plastic. If you live in the Bellingham area, you can donate and get some great perks like a starter basket of Blue Dot products in our branded containers, and refills for a year.</p>
<p>If you are not in our area, but you like this innovative idea and want to support our efforts, even a $5 donation will help. We'll keep you informed about our progress. If you donate $25, we'll send you a sturdy, recycled cotton grocery bag with out fabulous Blue Dot logo! Check the perks section for more. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our crowdfunding goal of $40,000, it will tell us the time is not yet right for this idea and funds will be returned to the donors. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What You Can Do...</h3>
<p>Help support our efforts financially- even a small donation will bring us that much closer to showing that you CAN buy what you need without buying another plastic bottle! </p>
<p>GET THE WORD OUT! Let your friends know! Tell your co-workers! All those people that you know are freaking about about plastic garbage in the oceans. All of you who hate having to dispose of another plastic bottle. Tell the world! It's time! </p>
