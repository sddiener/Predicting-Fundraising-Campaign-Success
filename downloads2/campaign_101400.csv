<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Terraforma Project was born in August 2013 based on the need for economic and social development in the region, based on the local opening to foreign tourism. While the project was being developed and new skills were acquired, in March 2016 we arrived at the desired concept and decided to dedicate ourselves to the project full time with self-financing, and at the end of the year we were able to approve an application that gave us the support Create with a more detailed business plan and some initial financing for what will be the formation of the Cooperative, but to be able to develop the job and create stable jobs this is not enough.</p>

<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>The Terraforma Project aims to evolve from a project to promote the region to Cooperative Terraforma, a non-profit cooperative focused on ecotourism, agrotourism and rural tourism, whose objective is to offer tourist animation services such as walking and cycling rails, The village festivals, and the agricultural life, not forgetting, of course, the canoe trips. In addition we also offer workshops in various areas such as construction of urban gardens, photography, observation of fauna and flora. During the low seasons of tourism we have already planned a series of small events that aim at traditional activities like Carnival and the Janeiras. Also in the summer our Festivals: the Fountain Festival, an ecological festival in a village with a long tradition of festivals in São João and the Festival RPM, a sports festival that aims at the competition of ecological sports.<br/>As a non-profit cooperative, we have no profits but surpluses, which will be applied to our conservation projects such as river clearing, pond cleaning and reforestation, as well as our social projects such as sports and artistic clubs and distribution Of agricultural surpluses.

It's essential to have a breathable jacket that blocks rain while simultaneously allowing moisture (aka your sweat) to escape. Our jacket is exceptional in its ability to compress. See it for yourself!! We were excited that our backers loved the many pockets on our first jacket, so we decided to do it again. There are 4 inner and three outer pockets that can hold all your gear.  Our jacket is the best packable, lightweight, all year-round jacket that will keep you feeling warm and looking stylish anywhere. Perfect for travel and adventure because it doesn’t require much packing space.  Traditional jackets are bulky and awkward, and usually not very eco-friendly. Here’s how the Satori Jacket compares.No water gets through, and we mean that! While Satori is breathable, allows moisture to escape and provides much comfort to its users, protecting your valuables is of the utmost importance. The YKK zippers and the outer protective ripstop membrane don't allow a single drop of water to penetrate to damage your electronics. See it in action!  According to a report in The BMJ, a leading peer-reviewed medical journal, a person loses 7% to 10% of their body heat through their head. Our double sided, adjustable, helmet-compatible, stretchable, thermal insulated hood with its soft lining for maximum protection and comfort, will keep you warm and protected in every season. Never adjust your hood again when it's windy, rainy or stormy. Our double sided hood is built to keep you safe and protected. See it for yourself:  You don't even have to adjust the draw strings, you just stretch the hood and cover your helmet, that's it. See for yourself: For safety reasons, we have designed the hood to adjust around any size helmet.  High neck design for added warmth, comfort and protection.Ventilation is always as important as the fabric itself. Our jacket is designed with a state-of-the-art under-arm ventilation system that is stretchable and allows moisture to escape to keep you cool. Mobility is very important when outdoors or traveling. While many jackets feel stiff, our jacket is stretchable and allows you full mobility without any restrictions. Both lightweight and durable, our jacket is constructed with premium fabric and state of the art stitching and is set to protect you while outdoors working, traveling or simply enjoying life.    Level G-III inspection provides assurance of top-quality workmanship and function, and avoiding any issues during production. We have used this type of inspection service before. Our manufacturer's clients include some of the top brands in the world like a Arc'teryx, REI, Patagonia, Columbia, and more.A fabric must have a UPF of 30 to qualify for The Skin Cancer Foundation’s Seal of Recommendation. A UPF of 30 to 49 offers very good protection, while UPF 50+ rates as excellent.  High quality knitted ripstop fabric is woven; and fade, wrinkle, and crack resistant. The Satori jacket is so light and sleek and will look amazing on you. Support us today; back this project!!If you love to travel and explore other places then you MUST have The Satori Jacket. It is light and easy to pack. One of our ambassadors, Sarah Griffith, is sharing her thoughts about Satori. Sarah travels the world and has been to many countries throughout Asia and South America. Take a listen: Patent pending unmatched 5-in-1 design: provides superior warmth and balanced heat throughout your body. You do not need to have multiple layers to feel the power of SATORI: Every jacket comes with a washing instructions label. For best results: please wash in maximum temperature of 40°C/104°F; do not bleach; hang to dry; do not tumble dry; iron on low temperature; do not dry clean. We know that spills happen, especially when you are out and about enjoying dinner or sipping a glass of wine on a chilly night with your family and friends. So, we made Satori stain resistant! Be it salsa, coffee, beer, wine, soda, or cocktails, our jacket will help you come out of every gathering stain free.   We have compared our jacket with Arc'teryx, Cerium LT, and The North Face Summit L3. Our comparisons are below:Our Satori™ Jackets are made per standard US sizing. If you are between sizes, we suggest you size up for a comfortable fit.The Early Bird special prices are available for a limited time, so get yours early! We’re dedicated to delivering an amazing product just like we did with our previous campaign, and you can rest assured that the Satori™  Jacket is also top quality. We are expecting to deliver The Satori™ Jacket in November 2020. We will keep you updated of the progress after the end of our campaign. If you have any questions related to Packsture during or after the campaign, you can always reach out to us at contact@packsture.comWe have accounts with major shipping companies such as UPS, FEDEX, DHL, and USPS. We shipped most jackets using UPS and FEDEX. Our U.S. backers received their rewards within two (2) to three (3) days of shipping.For our International backers, we used a combination of FEDEX, DHL, and UPS, and most backers received their jackets within two (2) to (3) weeks of shipping.COVID-19: As of today, we are not aware of any delays in worldwide shipping. We use commercial accounts, and our packages have been getting to their destinations without any issues. For international backers, customs and duties are charged by your country but never by us. Many of our backers received their parcels without any additional charges. We will offer worldwide FREE shipping including insurance and VAT as we did with our first campaign. If you follow the sizing chart carefully, the Satori™ jacket will fit you.  Please order a size up if you're between sizes, or your size fluctuates. Still, if you wish to exchange your jacket, we will allow exchanges, but you’ll have to pay for the two way shipping. The item must be unworn and still have the tags attached to it. We have a 30 day exchange policy. Our warranty means that you have 10 years to open the package and inspect it for manufacturing defects and send it back to us for a replacement. All garments eventually show signs of wear, and damages and wear-and-tear are not covered under Satori's 10 year warranty. The item must be unworn and still have the tags attached to it. We will collect needed sizing and shipping information from you after the campaign ends. We have our own in-house staff that is in charge of fulfillment.  We ship from the United States; we include insurance and tracking for your parcels.Social media is the best way to connect and communicate with us. You get to tag and follow along on some of our amazing adventures.",90.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>I've been going to Camp Wanapitei since I was 11 years old. It is a canoe tripping camp in Northern Ontario. This coming summer is my last year of camp, Voyageurs II, a 2 month canoe trip up to the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>I am earning as much money as I can through working various part-time jobs and hoping to supplement that with this campaign. I need to raise and earn $6000 I need to pay for my portion of the camp fees and travel expenses. I sincerely appreciate your help and support.</p>

</div><h2><b>Not a
long time ago…</b></h2><p></p>
<p>We discovered Drift Trikes during a journey abroad and we totally fell in love
with the sensation this little vehicle can offer you. It’s right between rally
and kart racing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like most people, we cannot use this amazing vehicle at home because there is
no proper hills to ride. We thought there should be a way to ride these even
without hills.</p>
<p>During our research process we tried a lot of options from thermic motors to electrical propulsion. But there is one design that really gave us the best feelings: electrical traction. This is how the e-Trike Flat Drifter is born.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/693908/files/20140704045106-IMG_3116.1.jpg?1404474666"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p><b></b></p><h2><b>We need
you to help us launching the most amazing electric drift trike!</b></h2><p></p>
<p>We
truly believe this electric vehicle is an amazing way to enjoy cities, nature and
landscapes with more fun than ever. To let people all over the world like you
discover it, we need some funds to launch the production!</p>
<p>We need
your help to raise 25 000€ to produce the first e-Trikes:</p>
<p>Those 25 000€ will help us to buy the
raw materials, such as motors, frames, powerful batteries, PVC wheel covers...
They will also cover the Crowdfunding expenses (payments fees and website
fees).</p>
<p>To convince you to help us we prepared a
list of rewards that will blow your mind, from our very unique T-Shirts to a fully
equipped e-trike with 2 batteries.</p>
<p>And if you really want to get your hands
on this electric drift trike enjoy the early bird reward that let you get a
fully equipped BeeRide e-Trike flat drifter for only 1 290€ instead of 1 690€
(limited to 5).</p>
<p>If this project is successfully funded
we will be pleased to ship your rewards for Christmas for the apparel &amp; early birds and late January for all others!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/718238/files/20140715013814-IMG_3316.JPG?1405413494"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2><b>About the Electric Drift Trike Flat Drifter</b></h2><p>We worked over two years on the perfect Drift Trike. This research has lead us to what the Flat Drifter is going to be. A 1000W motor on a 100% high resistance steel frame and a 48V15Ah Battery. The least you can notice is that it is the most powerful Drift  Trike ever produced.</p><p>The combination of this 48V 15Ah battery with the 1000W front motor is just unbelievable. It goes fast, it climbs hills, it can ride every solid ground surface from asphalt to grass. It is the most powerful electric drift trike on the market!</p><h2><b>You
will make the difference</b></h2><p></p>
<p>We
started this amazing project with the idea that we wanted to have fun and share
the fun with as many people as possible. But beyond the fun part we want to do things
properly.</p>
<p>We
chose an electric system to avoid any CO2 emission while using our products.
Also we designed a product that is strong enough to let you play with it as
much as possible. With a single battery charge you’ll be able to enjoy over 2
hours of fun drifting, and if speed is what you're looking for, then you’ll be
happy to know that our e-Trike Flat Drifter can go up to 35km/h uphill or 45km/h on flat ground and of course even faster downhill.</p>
<p>We
tested it in several conditions and we are proud to have a very strong product
that never failed any of our rough tests.</p>
<p>We are
also starting partnerships to recycle your old batteries when they’re dead in
an ecological way. It really matters to us that our products have the minimum
impact on the environment.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/693918/files/20140704050045-bowl_grind.jpg?1404475245"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><b></b></p><h2><b>A well
thought project</b></h2><p></p>
<p>Before putting this project online we
studied all aspects of it. We invested our savings to develop several prototypes

The Rider Post (French)                            Alliancy le mag (French)
Not a
long time ago…
We discovered Drift Trikes during a journey abroad and we totally fell in love
with the sensation this little vehicle can offer you. It’s right between rally
and kart racing.
Unfortunately, like most people, we cannot use this amazing vehicle at home because there is
no proper hills to ride. We thought there should be a way to ride these even
without hills.
During our research process we tried a lot of options from thermic motors to electrical propulsion. But there is one design that really gave us the best feelings: electrical traction. This is how the e-Trike Flat Drifter is born.
We need
you to help us launching the most amazing electric drift trike!
We
truly believe this electric vehicle is an amazing way to enjoy cities, nature and
landscapes with more fun than ever. To let people all over the world like you
discover it, we need some funds to launch the production!
We need
your help to raise 25 000€ to produce the first e-Trikes:
Those 25 000€ will help us to buy the
raw materials, such as motors, frames, powerful batteries, PVC wheel covers...
They will also cover the Crowdfunding expenses (payments fees and website
fees).
To convince you to help us we prepared a
list of rewards that will blow your mind, from our very unique T-Shirts to a fully
equipped e-trike with 2 batteries.
And if you really want to get your hands
on this electric drift trike enjoy the early bird reward that let you get a
fully equipped BeeRide e-Trike flat drifter for only 1 290€ instead of 1 690€
(limited to 5).
If this project is successfully funded
we will be pleased to ship your rewards for Christmas for the apparel & early birds and late January for all others!About the Electric Drift Trike Flat DrifterWe worked over two years on the perfect Drift Trike. This research has lead us to what the Flat Drifter is going to be. A 1000W motor on a 100% high resistance steel frame and a 48V15Ah Battery. The least you can notice is that it is the most powerful Drift  Trike ever produced.The combination of this 48V 15Ah battery with the 1000W front motor is just unbelievable. It goes fast, it climbs hills, it can ride every solid ground surface from asphalt to grass. It is the most powerful electric drift trike on the market!You
will make the difference
We
started this amazing project with the idea that we wanted to have fun and share
the fun with as many people as possible. But beyond the fun part we want to do things
properly.
We
chose an electric system to avoid any CO2 emission while using our products.
Also we designed a product that is strong enough to let you play with it as
much as possible. With a single battery charge you’ll be able to enjoy over 2
hours of fun drifting, and if speed is what you're looking for, then you’ll be
happy to know that our e-Trike Flat Drifter can go up to 35km/h uphill or 45km/h on flat ground and of course even faster downhill.
We
tested it in several conditions and we are proud to have a very strong product
that never failed any of our rough tests.
We are
also starting partnerships to recycle your old batteries when they’re dead in
an ecological way. It really matters to us that our products have the minimum
impact on the environment.
A well
thought project
Before putting this project online we
studied all aspects of it. We invested our savings to develop several prototypes
and we now are ready to commercialize our e-Trike in early 2015.
This funding will be the first step in a
long run and we would love to have you trying to make history with BeeRide!About BeeRideBeeRide is a young innovative company specialized in electric vehicles.

<p>Hi Friends and Supporters, thanks for your interest in my project. I have been trying to find the support to finish my invention but, as we all know, the current economy doesn't allow for many people to believe in a new product. I'm asking for not only your help but also to believe in me and my product. I hope you checked out the video and saw ""The Sniper"" in action! As a lifelong ball player and coach, I love all kinds of sports. But the bottom line is I am a teacher and I have a burning passion for making people better at what they do. I have invented and designed a number of successful baseball training devices. They are used at all levels from tee ball to the professional level.</p>
<p>I’ve also spent a fair amount of time on the golf course and played with men and women of a wide range of abilities. If I had to paint them all with one brush, it would be that everyone could drop 5-10 strokes from their game, if they could just drain a higher percentage of putts. Now I’m not talking only longer putts, say outside of 15 feet. I’m primarily talking in the 6 to 15 foot range. That is where the majority of strokes are wasted whether you are an amateur or professional. And its not that their putting stroke is necessarily bad. It's that they just don't have the correct alignment. That's where the Sniper laser comes in.</p>
<p>My research showed that most golf training aids have a very short lifespan. The primary complaints I found is that they do not work for a wide enough range of abilities, and they cannot be used legally on the course. In developing the Sniper Laser Putting System, I took this into consideration. That’s why the same putter you practice with and get the feel for with the laser guidance, is the identical putter you can use on the course, without the lasers installed.</p>
<p>Now I can’t promise you will sink ridiculous putts, like the famous Chevy Chase scene in Caddyshack, <a href=""http://youtu.be/qNVU23knqZw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/qNVU23knqZw</a> but I can guarantee you will not only become a better putter and more competitive player, you’ll have a lot more fun, and as <strong>YOUR</strong> coach that’s my bottom line! Finally, I'm asking you to join the ""TEAM"" because it is going to take a team to get this done, I clearly see that now. Thank you so much.</p>

What We Will Use the Funds For

<p>The SWAYY Premus™ and Eira™ are your all-in-one hammock camping systems. What started out as a bunch of crazy ideas has now come to fruition in the form of an amazing outdoor experience. Let us SWAYY you to go anywhere and do anything, outside.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Problem</strong></h3>
<p>When you put a sleeping bag in the hammock with you, the insulation compresses on your backside and you get cold.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527531860/atgpyucde3c5yfv339se.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You don't hammock camp? Let us ask a question:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Solution</strong></h3>
<p>We use ""Loft"" technology to hang insulation lower than your bum... No more CBS (Cold Butt Syndrome). </p>
<p>Loft is the ability of insulation to trap air between the fibers (synthetic insulation) or feather dander (down). Loft allows for the trapped air pockets to be warmed up. For our synthetic insulation, this is achieved by allowing the insulation to Loft without any compression below your backside. The down insulation follows the same model, it just uses a different material.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527532196/njvzunvdnlgqw81542vo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The SWAYY Premus™ and Eira™ work using 3 main layers of material. </p>
<ul>
<li>The 1st holds your weight. (Up to 400lbs!)</li>
<li>The 2nd insulates you using ""loft"" so that it does not compress against your backside, in essence, the insulation drapes a little lower than the hammock-body fabric (load-bearing layer). </li>
<li>The 3rd layer is a shell that breaks the wind.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus we give you:  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527532336/e2uocyirkdxtfsy14xjd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Premus™ is constructed using four parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is the weight bearing layer, or hammock body, is constructed using a 1.6oz per square yard, 40 Denier, nylon fabric with a 6-way ripstop to increase strength and durability. </li>
<li>The second is the insulation layer. This layer consists of two layers of Primaloft Silver 3.0oz insulation to keep opulent warmth. Each insulation layer is cut, sewn, darted and pleated in a specific way to create three specific air gaps under your backside that won't compress.</li>
<li>The third is the shell layer. This wind breaking layer is made of a .9oz per square yard, 15 Denier, nylon fabric that is designed to be lightweight and breathable enough to prevent moisture build-up.</li>
<li>The fourth and final piece is the full-length zipper. When zipped up, this allows for total warmth for the chilly nice. When unzipped, this allows for a steady warmth under your bum but keeps it cool enough for summer camping. The zipper is a #8 zipper that is strong, durable, and lightweight.</li>

</div></div>","The SWAYY Premus™ and Eira™ are your all-in-one hammock camping systems. What started out as a bunch of crazy ideas has now come to fruition in the form of an amazing outdoor experience. Let us SWAYY you to go anywhere and do anything, outside.
 
The Problem
When you put a sleeping bag in the hammock with you, the insulation compresses on your backside and you get cold.

You don't hammock camp? Let us ask a question:
 
The Solution
We use ""Loft"" technology to hang insulation lower than your bum... No more CBS (Cold Butt Syndrome). 
Loft is the ability of insulation to trap air between the fibers (synthetic insulation) or feather dander (down). Loft allows for the trapped air pockets to be warmed up. For our synthetic insulation, this is achieved by allowing the insulation to Loft without any compression below your backside. The down insulation follows the same model, it just uses a different material.

The SWAYY Premus™ and Eira™ work using 3 main layers of material. 

The 1st holds your weight. (Up to 400lbs!)
The 2nd insulates you using ""loft"" so that it does not compress against your backside, in essence, the insulation drapes a little lower than the hammock-body fabric (load-bearing layer). 
The 3rd layer is a shell that breaks the wind.

 
Thus we give you:  
The Premus™ is constructed using four parts.

The first is the weight bearing layer, or hammock body, is constructed using a 1.6oz per square yard, 40 Denier, nylon fabric with a 6-way ripstop to increase strength and durability. 
The second is the insulation layer. This layer consists of two layers of Primaloft Silver 3.0oz insulation to keep opulent warmth. Each insulation layer is cut, sewn, darted and pleated in a specific way to create three specific air gaps under your backside that won't compress.
The third is the shell layer. This wind breaking layer is made of a .9oz per square yard, 15 Denier, nylon fabric that is designed to be lightweight and breathable enough to prevent moisture build-up.
The fourth and final piece is the full-length zipper. When zipped up, this allows for total warmth for the chilly nice. When unzipped, this allows for a steady warmth under your bum but keeps it cool enough for summer camping. The zipper is a #8 zipper that is strong, durable, and lightweight.

U.S. Provisional Patent App. No. 62/595,254









The Premus™ Suspension is constructed using 3 main parts: The carabiners, CD101 aluminum alloy cinch buckles, and Poly/Dyneema webbing. 

The carabiners are made of high grade A6061 cold-forged aluminum alloy. Each biner weights 25.7g. The closed gate strength is 10kN and the open strength is 3kN.
The CD101 cinch buckles are crafted for easy tensile adjustability of the hammock and are made using an aluminum alloy for the perfect balance of strength and weight.
The high-tensile strength webbing is made from a polyester and Dyneema blend. This keeps the weight and wearability low and the strength high. Our webbing is 1"" wide and is 4.9g per foot.

Entire System Tech Specs:

Weight Maximum: 400 lbs / 182 kg
Length: 10 ft (11ft for long option)
Stuff-Sack Dimensions: 19"" x 8"" x 16""

The Eira™ is constructed using four parts. 

The first is the weight bearing layer, or hammock body, is constructed using a 1.6oz per square yard, 40 Denier, nylon fabric with a 6-way ripstop to increase strength and durability. (Up to 400lbs!)
The second is the insulation layer. This layer consists of 20 tubular baffles that hold 800FP DownTek storm treated goose down. Each baffle is filled with precisely 1.25oz of down.
The third is the shell layer. This wind breaking layer is made of a .9oz per square yard, 15 Denier, nylon fabric that is designed to be lightweight and breathable enough to prevent moisture build-up.

At 2.8 grams per foot, the ridgeline is made of 1/2"" high-tensile strength polyester that yields low stretch and 500lbs of breaking strength.
The rain-fly is made of 2.7oz Wide Sil Nylon. It is a low stretch fabric with a ripstop grid. It has at least 1500 mm of head pressure. This fabric is a lightweight and waterproof.
The quick deploy sock cover is made of a 1.6oz 6-way ripstop nylon designed for ease of access to shelter when the storms come rolling in. When the sun comes out, simply place the four titanium nail stakes in their respective channels and pull the sock back to encase your shelter.
The 6"" and 2.8g ultralight titanium nail stakes can be driven into hard soil without getting bent or damaged.

<p>There are lots of people like me. I had an idea to create a community of all fixed gear enthusiasts from the entire world. The main task is to promote the fixers and the way of life, behind it. I just want to make riding popular, and fixed gear riding as well. But we don't have a platform, where you may easily find guys to ride around your town in the evening, chat and relax after a hard working day. And even find soul mates in another town. Or imagine you need to find a spare part for your bike. Currently we are split into FB groups, forums, which no one knows and can’t find them.

It comes in a stable package, and it helps guarantee your clean feeling while and after showering. The Travelshowerhero is only 6.7 inches long and 1.4 inches wide. The package is only 7 inches long and 1.7 inches wide.But I already have a hand shower; do I need the Travelshowerhero?The standard hand shower is great for one place: your home.

It fits in all your suitcases, in your hand luggage, and even in your handbag. The Travelshowerhero is very helpful for globetrotters because of the small space it takes. Just look how small the package is compared to the toothbrush.How do I use the Travelshowerhero? You don’t have to be an expert to install it. The principle is very simple.

<p>The FUNCTION flashlight was designed for the person that doesn't want a specific light for every task. Because of the light's dual 1/4-20 tripod threads and unique form factor, it's much more versatile than the standard stick flashlight configuration. The Function flashlight can output up to 1600 lumens but since its output is infinitely variable, you can turn the brightness down to exactly where you need it. This light can be used for biking, hiking, camping, and videography just to list a few. Support our project to take advantage of the introductory pricing! </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mode 0</strong> - The light will be OFF in Mode 0.</p>
<p><strong>Mode 1</strong> - The light will be On in Mode 1 and adjusting the knob will change the output brightness of the light.</p>
<p><strong>Mode 2</strong> - Rate control strobe mode allows the user to change the strobe rate via the control knob. By default, the brightness is 100% but the brightness will be saved when adjusted in Mode 3.</p>
<p><strong>Mode 3</strong> - Brightness control strobe mode allows the user to change the strobe brightness via the control knob. The strobe rate is determined by the setting in Mode 2.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Lockout</strong> - Soft lockout will prevent accidental activation of the light. </p>
<p><strong>Mechanical Lockout</strong> - Mechanical lockout will prevent accidental activation of the light by physically disconnecting the battery. Using the mechanical lockout is recommended when the Function flashlight will be stored away for a long period of time.</p>

Battery Compatibility - The Function light can be used a single Lithium Ion  18650, two Primary CR123A, or two Lithium Ion 18350 batteries.
Battery Life (on Max)
Lithium Ion 18650 - 1 hr 40 min
CR123A Lithium - 1 hr
IMR18350 - 40min
Reverse Polarity Protection - The light's driver circuitry is designed to protect itself if the battery is ever installed backwards.

1/4-20 Tripod Mounting Threads - Two 1/4-20 tripod threads on the top and back of the light allows fo easy mounting with commonly available camera mounts.
Anti-Reflective Coated Glass - The mineral glass lens has an anti-reflective coating on both surfaces to maximize the light output.
Water Resistant - The Function light is designed with O-rings and gaskets so that it can function in any weather condition.
Battery lockout - A half turn counter-clockwise on the battery cap will lock out the light to prevent accidental activation
Thermal Protection - An on board temperature chip allows the microcontroller to manage the heat generated by the LED's.
Microcontroller Powered - The functionality of the light is all programmed via an ATTINY microcontroller. With a 8-SOIC clip, the Function flashlight can be reprogrammed such that it meets your specific needs.
 
 
Operation

 
Mode 0 - The light will be OFF in Mode 0.
Mode 1 - The light will be On in Mode 1 and adjusting the knob will change the output brightness of the light.
Mode 2 - Rate control strobe mode allows the user to change the strobe rate via the control knob. By default, the brightness is 100% but the brightness will be saved when adjusted in Mode 3.
Mode 3 - Brightness control strobe mode allows the user to change the strobe brightness via the control knob. The strobe rate is determined by the setting in Mode 2.
Soft Lockout - Soft lockout will prevent accidental activation of the light. 
Mechanical Lockout - Mechanical lockout will prevent accidental activation of the light by physically disconnecting the battery. Using the mechanical lockout is recommended when the Function flashlight will be stored away for a long period of time.

Project Progress
We have a few fully functioning prototypes at the moment. We are still in the process of improving the driver and refining the code. We aim to have two more revisions to work out any issues before the final production run. We want to make sure the electronics and code work together seamlessly to create an easy to use and efficient flashlight. In tandem, we will be working hard to provide a wide range of accessories to accompany the Function light at it's launch.

It started with just a pair of hands crafting a new kind of skateboard. A board designed so friends and family would have an easier time learning and riding together.The design has grown with our founder, Tom Wang, and the initial concept from 2003 has evolved to become a skateboard that fits easily into an out-and-about urban lifestyle.On Oct. 18, 2016, the well-refined concept named Elos, which stands for ""Effortless Lifestyle of Skateboarding,” became a reality with the support of over 600 Kickstarter visionaries around the world.Today, we are announcing the new Elos 2018 model. We kept all the features people told us they loved, then we made it lighter and cruise smoother so the next generation of Elos enthusiasts can continue the story of learning and riding together.Are you in? Running around town or getting to the office has never been so easy or efficient.Perfect for college campuses. Turn heads as you zip around in style, then dock your board next to you for easy storage.Discover a fun new way to spend time with your friends and bond with your family.
  
Ultra-portable  At only 4 lbs, you can easily carry Elos with your backpack, or messenger bag, for hands-free travel. Easy to learnThe iconic extra-wide deck design makes Elos stable and user-friendly even for absolute beginners. Cruisability Elos is a lightweight cruiser with big soft wheels built for the smoothest ride in the city! 
Everyday usability  Dress the way you need, still able to ride everywhere while looking sharp. Our special surface coating will not scratch up your suit. Once you are there, easily put your Elos next to you with our patented Table-Dock system. Ride safe at nightBuilt-in reflectors on the trucks make the rider visible to pedestrians and cars for night ride safety. 
Maneuverability  The race car-inspired design makes Elos handle sharp turns smoothly. Experienced users can turn on a dime.

<p>We are the Guardian Geese – a project team passionate about
developing ideas that help the world be a better, safer place.</p>
<p>Many of us have travelled as hitchhikers or in dangerous
countries and situations. The fear of something bad happening while travelling
and the unease our friends and families felt, paved the way for the idea behind
Guardian Goose – the travel safety app.</p>
<p>We have developed the complex back-end technology behind
Guardian Goose, and are now asking for <b>YOUR HELP</b> in the final steps towards
launching Guardian Goose to the world, and thus making travel safer. </p>
<p><span><b>WHAT IS GUARDIAN GOOSE?</b></span></p>
<p>Guardian Goose is a travel safety app, developed to keep its
users safe and give their friends and families peace of mind.</p>
<p><span><b>DEVELOPMENT OF GUARDIAN GOOSE.</b></span></p>
<p>The back-end technologies upon which Guardian Goose is based,
are pretty complicated. These include GPS tracking, mobile phone status checking
technology, intelligent decision making capabilities, automated messaging and
call technology, and many more. <br/>
Our team has more than a decade experience in developing these elaborate systems,
including the artificial intelligence elements which we have integrated into
the Guardian Goose technology. </p>
<p>Most of the Guardian Goose technology has been completed or
is close to completion. It is only the app design and development which still
needs to be completed and localised into the languages which we would like to
offer our service in. </p>
<p><span><b>WHY USE GUARDIAN GOOSE?</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Two words: Travel Safety. </i></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The world has become a dangerous place. </span><br/></p><p></p><p>Not only hitchhikers are at risk. Lone travelling business
travellers, especially women, are vulnerable to attacks or worse. </p>
<p>Friends, family, and sometimes co-workers, are often left
worrying if their loved ones have arrived safe and sound.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a simple thing such as a dead cell-phone battery
can cause stress, worry and even panic, as Neal Bruewer, Co-Creator and CEO of
Guardian Goose, the travel safety app, tells: “I have been in sales for a long
time, which means I travel a fair bit. When I travelled, I made it a habit to
call my wife when I arrived at the hotel. On one occasion, my battery went flat
on the way to the hotel, just after I had arranged to meet a client straight
after arriving. Once there, I realised I had forgotten my charger at home, and
a quick ask around for a suitable charger came up empty. Since my business
partner was waiting, I decided to find a solution later and concentrate on the
business at hand. Later that evening, much to my surprise, the phone of my
client rang and he handed it to me, saying I should take the call. On the other
end was my panicked wife, having spent the last couple hours calling all of my
colleagues, desperately trying to find out what had happened to me.”</p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Knowing that you have a Guardian Goose watching over you,
gives you, your family and friends peace of mind.</span>
<p><i>WHO SHOULD USE GUARDIAN GOOSE?</i></p>
<p>Travelling alone, or in vulnerably small groups, can be
perilous.<br/>
Whether hitchhiking your way across the world alone – or with a friend –,
travelling alone for business or pleasure or any other unsecure travel
situation, it is comforting to know that someone is watching over you, and your
friends and family know all is well. </p>
<p><span><b>HOW GUARDIAN GOOSE WORKS.</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Guardian Goose app is free to download, however each trip you use Guardian Goose to monitor your travels with, is paid through the usual payment options.</span></p><p>1. First, you set up your user account in a few simple steps
and prepare Guardian Goose to look after you.</p>
<p>2. Once the user account is set up, you can start a trip
profile. Guardian Goose automatically calculates all possible routes.</p>
<p>3. When Guardian Goose notices an unplanned deviation from
the given route, it activates its elaborate alarm system (EAS).</p>
<p><b>- How does our EAS work?</b></p>
<p>1. As soon as you deviate from the most likely routes, EAS
sends a message to you. If you answer that message with a code word of your choice in a predefined amount of time EAS is turned off and it
asks you whether you would like to abort the journey or pause for some time, in
order to get back on track.</p>
<p>2. However, if you fail
to answer, or do so in an unexpected way,
EAS will activate alarm code orange. That means it calls you, and asks for
another code word. If you do not answer the call or answer in an unexpected
way, EAS acitvates the alarm code red.</p>
<p>3. When EAS activates
the red alarm, it autonomously sends a message to your predefined contacts to
inform them of the situation, and request for them to call you immediately. If necessary, GUARDIAN
GOOSE provides them with the stored photos, your location and a log of where
you started and what happend so far.</p>
<p>There is also a panic
button which, if pushed somewhere along the way, immediately elevates the alarm
code to red and initiates the emergency procedures.</p>

We are the Guardian Geese – a project team passionate about
developing ideas that help the world be a better, safer place.
Many of us have travelled as hitchhikers or in dangerous
countries and situations. The fear of something bad happening while travelling
and the unease our friends and families felt, paved the way for the idea behind
Guardian Goose – the travel safety app.
We have developed the complex back-end technology behind
Guardian Goose, and are now asking for YOUR HELP in the final steps towards
launching Guardian Goose to the world, and thus making travel safer. 
WHAT IS GUARDIAN GOOSE?
Guardian Goose is a travel safety app, developed to keep its
users safe and give their friends and families peace of mind.
DEVELOPMENT OF GUARDIAN GOOSE.
The back-end technologies upon which Guardian Goose is based,
are pretty complicated. These include GPS tracking, mobile phone status checking
technology, intelligent decision making capabilities, automated messaging and
call technology, and many more. 
Our team has more than a decade experience in developing these elaborate systems,
including the artificial intelligence elements which we have integrated into
the Guardian Goose technology. 
Most of the Guardian Goose technology has been completed or
is close to completion. It is only the app design and development which still
needs to be completed and localised into the languages which we would like to
offer our service in. 
WHY USE GUARDIAN GOOSE?
Two words: Travel Safety. The world has become a dangerous place. Not only hitchhikers are at risk. Lone travelling business
travellers, especially women, are vulnerable to attacks or worse. 
Friends, family, and sometimes co-workers, are often left
worrying if their loved ones have arrived safe and sound.
Sometimes, a simple thing such as a dead cell-phone battery
can cause stress, worry and even panic, as Neal Bruewer, Co-Creator and CEO of
Guardian Goose, the travel safety app, tells: “I have been in sales for a long
time, which means I travel a fair bit. When I travelled, I made it a habit to
call my wife when I arrived at the hotel. On one occasion, my battery went flat
on the way to the hotel, just after I had arranged to meet a client straight
after arriving. Once there, I realised I had forgotten my charger at home, and
a quick ask around for a suitable charger came up empty. Since my business
partner was waiting, I decided to find a solution later and concentrate on the
business at hand. Later that evening, much to my surprise, the phone of my
client rang and he handed it to me, saying I should take the call. On the other
end was my panicked wife, having spent the last couple hours calling all of my
colleagues, desperately trying to find out what had happened to me.”Knowing that you have a Guardian Goose watching over you,
gives you, your family and friends peace of mind.
WHO SHOULD USE GUARDIAN GOOSE?
Travelling alone, or in vulnerably small groups, can be
perilous.
Whether hitchhiking your way across the world alone – or with a friend –,
travelling alone for business or pleasure or any other unsecure travel
situation, it is comforting to know that someone is watching over you, and your
friends and family know all is well. 
HOW GUARDIAN GOOSE WORKS.
The Guardian Goose app is free to download, however each trip you use Guardian Goose to monitor your travels with, is paid through the usual payment options.1. First, you set up your user account in a few simple steps
and prepare Guardian Goose to look after you.
2. Once the user account is set up, you can start a trip
profile. Guardian Goose automatically calculates all possible routes.
3. When Guardian Goose notices an unplanned deviation from
the given route, it activates its elaborate alarm system (EAS).
- How does our EAS work?
1. As soon as you deviate from the most likely routes, EAS
sends a message to you. If you answer that message with a code word of your choice in a predefined amount of time EAS is turned off and it
asks you whether you would like to abort the journey or pause for some time, in
order to get back on track.
2. However, if you fail
to answer, or do so in an unexpected way,
EAS will activate alarm code orange. That means it calls you, and asks for
another code word. If you do not answer the call or answer in an unexpected
way, EAS acitvates the alarm code red.
3. When EAS activates
the red alarm, it autonomously sends a message to your predefined contacts to
inform them of the situation, and request for them to call you immediately. If necessary, GUARDIAN
GOOSE provides them with the stored photos, your location and a log of where
you started and what happend so far.
There is also a panic
button which, if pushed somewhere along the way, immediately elevates the alarm
code to red and initiates the emergency procedures.

<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>My name is TJ, and I want to bike across the country. It has always been one of those things I see people doing and think ""wow, I really want to do that"". I have come up with many different reasons to not do it, but the other night I realized I will always have an excuse to not do something. So I am going to do it. In the spring of 2013 I will start in Los Angeles and bike to New York City.</p>
<p>I don't just want to spend 2.5 months on my bike for no reason, so I will be doing it all to raise money for my non profit organization, Sport Against Poverty. Money raised will be used to start soccer programs in underdeveloped areas of Kenya. That is what I call a win win.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Although it sounds simple, riding across the country is actually a very complex and costly endeavor. I am raising money to help cover some of the expenses I will incur on the trip:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Supplies (Tent, repairs, etc.)</li>
<li>Biking equipment</li>
<li>A website for people to follow, make pledges, etc. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This bike trip will allow me the opportunity to meet one of my lifetime goals, as well as to help other people. I am a huge fan of sports, and the power they can have. Raising money on this trip will allow me to work in Kenya with schools to develop soccer programs to give underprivileged youth opportunities both on and off the field. You can read all about the organization and its goals <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that not everyone can contribute, and that is fine. If you can't contribute, I ask that if you believe in what I am doing then you will just share it with your Facebook or Twitter friends, you never know who might come across it.</p>

<p>We would like you to meet the Crua Tribe. Here at Crua Outdoors we are constantly looking for new ways to make your lives (and ours) better. When we go on a camping trip, out to the beach or around the city, a few things that really annoy us are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not having enough space to pack our stuff</li>
<li>Making multiple trips to the car or house</li>
<li>Not having a place to sit</li>
<li>Keeping our gear protected in the rain </li>
<li>Being able to bring our tech and keep it safe</li>
</ul>
<p>So we thought, what if, like our modular tents, we had modular bags… plural. Bags for different uses, that are, in their own right, multi-functional, but also come together to work in perfect harmony? That’s so Crua! </p>

We would like you to meet the Crua Tribe. Here at Crua Outdoors we are constantly looking for new ways to make your lives (and ours) better. When we go on a camping trip, out to the beach or around the city, a few things that really annoy us are:

Not having enough space to pack our stuff
Making multiple trips to the car or house
Not having a place to sit
Keeping our gear protected in the rain 
Being able to bring our tech and keep it safe

So we thought, what if, like our modular tents, we had modular bags… plural. Bags for different uses, that are, in their own right, multi-functional, but also come together to work in perfect harmony? That’s so Crua! 
Up first, Cargo or skip ahead to   Thermo  |  Nomad  |  Armour 
 

This holdall is big enough to fit all the bits and bobs you need for a picnic, camping trip or just around the backyard. It has a collapsible rigid frame so when the top is closed, it became a sofa that can seat 2 people. PLUS… well thought out pockets, ease of use, and all terrain wheels!!





 
From the Shop Floor: A deeper dive into the product features of the Cargo.

 

We are Crua.  We HAVE to have an insulated bag! This bag excels at keeping the cold things cold and the warm things warm. Only the best insulation for this bag, boasting an R value or insulating capability to rival even the heavy hitting hard-sided coolers. And, fits right into the holdall so they can be seamlessly used together.

Everywhere I go, I always ask myself where do all the people around me come from? What language do they speak? What country are they from? Very often, I'd like to start a conversation, but I don't want to disturb them and I end-up regretting not having done it.</p><p>When travelling one day, I thought why not create an app that not only lets you see other tourists, but also their positions on a map! Wouldn't it be cool to see all the tourists around you on a map and seeing where they are from just by looking at their country flags? Then just click on their flags to see their profiles? You then would know what language they speak and what they like to do.  You can choose to contact them at your convenience and chat with them! Meet people from different nationality, origin and culture, or just find people from your country around you somewhere in the world.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556591487/gxqoiesfypfhac0glxwn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>What WAYFmobile gives you</h3><p>There are many usefulness of the application. Of course, you just learn that you can chat with other people, but you also can need someone to help you in case your are lost, you lost your money or luggage or you are ill or injured. With WAYFmobile, you can easily find someone close to you who speaks your language and could help you. Every frequent traveler knows that, in another country, it can be very difficult to find someone who speaks your language outside touristic areas. Even in large cities, like Bangkok or Tokyo, it can be often troublesome. </p><p>Another usefulness of the app is to find a friend to share a great moment, to share your nice pictures, or to travel with. You can find fellow travelers for life, even from another country to meet on your next trip somewhere in Asia or South America or elsewhere.</p><p>Sometimes, you may need a translator. Your are eating in a Vietnamese restaurant in Thanh Hoa, and you just don't understand the menu at all. With WAYFmobile, you can easily find someone who can translate the menu for you! You can even send a picture of the menu to one close user who would write you if this is chicken or squid! You can make a search through all users according to the name, the country or the language you are looking for.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565278258/edcnpxkprkpirstiq3k6.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>You may also need a guide or just a direction. You can quickly ask one other user your way if you are lost. Just look on WAYFmobile's map at people around you and tap on his or her shoulder! Someone could be happy to help you and even guide you for a few hours or more in a city that they know well! Even locals can use the app to be a guide or a translator in their own city or country. Even you can be a WAYFmobile guide in your own city or country! </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565277966/loakeldlyh6hirpdb6ew.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>How WAYFmobile works</h3><p>The application is free and will remain free. The goal is to get the most people around the world using the app so it would be easy to find someone who can help you anywhere you are. You just download the app from the Apple Store or the Google Store, and subscription is quick and easy. You can start using the app right away. You can enter more information in your profile whenever you want. You don't want to be followed? Easy, just click on the icon ""inactive"" and no user could see you, but you can continue to use WAYFmobile.</p><p>We already are planning to develop a  new version of WAYFmobile that gives you information about the countries or the cities you are visiting. This could be a Premium version that will be at a low cost.</p><h3>Why WAYFmobile needs your contribution</h3><p>We are planning of using publicity into the app to finance WAYFmobile (updates, customer service, servers, etc.).

Everywhere I go, I always ask myself where do all the people around me come from? What language do they speak? What country are they from? Very often, I'd like to start a conversation, but I don't want to disturb them and I end-up regretting not having done it.When travelling one day, I thought why not create an app that not only lets you see other tourists, but also their positions on a map! Wouldn't it be cool to see all the tourists around you on a map and seeing where they are from just by looking at their country flags? Then just click on their flags to see their profiles? You then would know what language they speak and what they like to do.  You can choose to contact them at your convenience and chat with them! Meet people from different nationality, origin and culture, or just find people from your country around you somewhere in the world.   What WAYFmobile gives youThere are many usefulness of the application. Of course, you just learn that you can chat with other people, but you also can need someone to help you in case your are lost, you lost your money or luggage or you are ill or injured. With WAYFmobile, you can easily find someone close to you who speaks your language and could help you. Every frequent traveler knows that, in another country, it can be very difficult to find someone who speaks your language outside touristic areas. Even in large cities, like Bangkok or Tokyo, it can be often troublesome. Another usefulness of the app is to find a friend to share a great moment, to share your nice pictures, or to travel with. You can find fellow travelers for life, even from another country to meet on your next trip somewhere in Asia or South America or elsewhere.Sometimes, you may need a translator. Your are eating in a Vietnamese restaurant in Thanh Hoa, and you just don't understand the menu at all. With WAYFmobile, you can easily find someone who can translate the menu for you! You can even send a picture of the menu to one close user who would write you if this is chicken or squid! You can make a search through all users according to the name, the country or the language you are looking for.  You may also need a guide or just a direction. You can quickly ask one other user your way if you are lost. Just look on WAYFmobile's map at people around you and tap on his or her shoulder! Someone could be happy to help you and even guide you for a few hours or more in a city that they know well! Even locals can use the app to be a guide or a translator in their own city or country. Even you can be a WAYFmobile guide in your own city or country!   How WAYFmobile worksThe application is free and will remain free. The goal is to get the most people around the world using the app so it would be easy to find someone who can help you anywhere you are. You just download the app from the Apple Store or the Google Store, and subscription is quick and easy. You can start using the app right away. You can enter more information in your profile whenever you want. You don't want to be followed? Easy, just click on the icon ""inactive"" and no user could see you, but you can continue to use WAYFmobile.We already are planning to develop a  new version of WAYFmobile that gives you information about the countries or the cities you are visiting. This could be a Premium version that will be at a low cost.Why WAYFmobile needs your contributionWe are planning of using publicity into the app to finance WAYFmobile (updates, customer service, servers, etc.). However, to start, we need your help! The production of the app cost a lot of money and then it needs some people to make it works! We need to find a server in order to keep confidential all users' information. We need someone to keep it updated, and someone to answer any question in case of problems.

Why waste space and time carrying multiple bags, or worrying about whether you brought the right bag in the first place?We set out to create a new line of bags that are not only completely versatile and tough as nails, but adaptable to what you need to carry across multiple environments. One Backpack. Three Configurations.The Adventurer is the first backpack that changes to fit your plans. Zip in one of three distinct center panels to create an entirely new backpack, ranging in volume from 1450 to 2300 cubic inches (24-38 liters).In our campaign, you can purchase the Adventurer with just one panel (the Standard) or with all three panels (Standard, Hunter, and Out & Back).Keep things simple and allow the light hiker or minimalist traveler to stash essentials without added weight or volume. Features an extra grab handle. Volume: 24 liters / 1450 cu. in.With a touch of tacti-cool features and MOLLE/PALS webbing, the Hunter is built for the practical rifleman seeking to fill a tag or the summit seeker with enough experience to know exactly what they need for their trip. Volume: 34 liters / 2100 cu. in.The Out & Back is perfect for carrying essentials for an unplanned overnighter while still remaining compact and versatile for longer trips where every item is needed or desired. The stash pocket is great for adding/removing layers due to changing weather. Volume: 38 liters / 2300 cu. in.Everyday FeaturesNo matter which panel you're using, the Adventurer always includes:
Laptop sleeve
Water bladder sleeve and hose holes
Horizontal and vertical mounting loops on all padded shoulder straps
Waist belt with mounting loops
Erector and sacrum padding with internal frame reinforcement
#10 zippers
  ""Whoa. Tell Me About That Carrier.""Rugged and versatile, Wrascal Carrier is our first product which converts into any of six configurations by simply zipping and unzipping side panels.Designed for ultimate durability and adaptability, Wrascal Carrier is built to military specifications, can lift over 400 pounds, and attaches to any backpack, daypack, or luggage. It includes:
Removable laptop sleeve with multiple pockets
Two large, zippered outer pockets
Pockets inside each side panel
Handles, shoulder strap, and waist belt
Easy to clean, water-resistant interior lining

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Our story isn’t unique. Every lake in America has a group of buddies who have a week exactly like ours. It's our yearly trip to the Belgrade Lakes in Maine, where we do nothing but fish, eat, sleep, laugh—and desperately try to figure out how we could extend the trip, adding an extra day or somehow (anyhow) make that week we love so much, be a bigger part of our lives.</p>
<p>Like the ancient proverb states, ""Choose a job you love and you'll never work a day in your life."" As such, we decided to start a business that would let us do more of the things we love most with the people we love most—and that’s how Revolutionary Baits Company was born.</p>
<p>We are also a group of amazing friends with wildly different backgrounds that are passionate about fishing, family, community and the environment. We feel fishing is much more than just a rod and reel with a hook and a bait. Fishing is a way of life, an experience, whether it’s your first time or your thousandth—it’s an opportunity to make a lifelong memory.</p>
<p>Our focus is laser sharp—design and engineer custom baits at the highest quality, that are an asset to any pro's tackle box and equally simple for any family of first time anglers to use. Let us welcome you to join in our passion—and our friendship—and to be Revolutionary in everything you do!</p>

The Bayonet was designed to mesmerize and cut through water with one goal in mind—Catch fish. Lastly, but equally important as catching fish, is how easy is it to use? The answer....Very! It's as simple as driving the hook through the center logo. Enjoy!</p>

<br/>Hi, we're David &amp; Shaun. We're both product esigners and have a combined 30 years experience in product development. We launched Colapz together in 2010 and were blown away by the positive response from our first customers with our initial products. Now we’re excited to bring you the 4-in-1, which we hope every person and their dog will want this year.<br/>
</div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<b>Risk &amp; Challenges</b><br/><br/>
<div>
<p>We have been working with our manufacturer for many years now, so we are very confident the project will run smoothly. There are always unexpected hurdles to face, but we will always be transparent and ensure regular communication between us and our backers about any challenges we face.</p>
<p>We have been very generous with our expected ship date, as we know it causes frustration for backers when projects run over. Therefore we have accounted for delays and are confident we can deliver on time. If in the unlikely event it does take a little longer, we will keep you updated.</p>
<p>Building something that will last is very important at Colapz HQ. To ensure this, we will have built a final production quality sample and tested it to destruction. Any amendments to the design will be incorporated. When production finally starts we have our own QC team based at source who will be checking everything at the various stages of manufacture, right up to when the product is dispatched. The product and materials will be tested to ensure they comply with all the food and safety regulations.</p>

<p>Two dozen Kuzzles come in a package. You simply figure out how many your drawer will hold and start fitting them together. They work like any other puzzle you have assembled. It doesn’t matter what size drawer you want to use, Kuzzles will give you a neat, organized way to store your K-Cups.</p>
<p>You can assemble them as a single color, checkerboard or let your creativity run wild.</p>
<p>We have Perks ranging from 1 box all the way up to wholesale quantities.</p>
<p>If you want to support this project but don’t want to order wholesale quantities of Kuzzles, there are experiential options.</p>
<p>I enjoy creating fused glass platters and am offering them as a choice. You can see samples in the video above.</p>
<p>I also live in Montana, if you want to float a river, fish or hike, I will devote 2 to 4 days helping you enjoy the splendor that Montana has to offer.</p>
<h1><strong>Why we need your help.<br/></strong></h1>
<p>We have our patent pending.</p>
<p>We have our prototypes made.</p>
<p>We need your help to create the 24 cavity die to make the Kuzzles and to produce our first high volume production run.</p>
<p>We also need funding to help design and produce our packaging. We want a simple, minimal, efficient packaging. We have located several companies to print and cut our boxes. We have the flat, unfolded template for the box. We simply need some of our local designer's time to finish the layout.</p>

<p><span><b>Will I really only have to charge Aer once a year?<br/></b></span><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Answer: Yes and no. It really depends how often you use Aer to blow air into things. One standard charge will give you enough juice to inflate forty balls. </span></p>
<br/><p><b>What else can Aer do?</b><br/><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Answer: Every product has its limitations. Unfortunately, we did not design Aer with the intention of it slicing, dicing, making Julienne fries or preparing your taxes. We did, however, discover a viable need in the market to alleviate the trouble most people have with older ball pumps. Thus spoke Aer.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>How long must I wait before I can buy this product in retail stores?<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Answer: March 2017. Perhaps if we do fare well enough on this particular crowdfunding campaign, we may, in fact, be able to expedite the release of the product to merchandisers.</span></p>
<br/><p><b>Does it come with a warranty?<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Answer: One year. You have 365 days to break it before we ship you a new one, on the house. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>

Introducing Aer: the All-In-One Precision Ball Pump. Precision pumping power. Aer is the last ball pump you’ll ever need. Its precision inflation technology gets any ball ready at the touch of a button. Simply use Aer’s easy-to-read, LCD screen to select from a wide range of regulation PSI presets, insert the retractable (and replaceable) needle into any ball with the proper port, hit ‘inflate” and voila! Aer fills the ball to the specified PSI level and stops automatically. It’s that simple.Stop wasting your time pumping. Aer gets you ready for the game faster without all the manual labor or trial and error of traditional ball pumps.  



Step 1: Charge


Step 2: Carry

Step 3: Select


Step 4: Inflate















Lots of designing, refining and defining went into the creation of the Aer ball pump. We developed the device with curved edges so that it would adapt and mold to the varying spherical contours of different ball shapes.
After speaking with many athletes and coaches, we also learned that the needles in older ball pumps that deliver the air are easily lost or misplaced. That’s why we thought it was important to provide Aer with a retractable needle that hides safely ensconced inside the body of the product when it’s not being used.

And, of course, we cannot forget the secret sauce that makes Aer the unique and innovative product that we claim it to be: the built-in motor that facilitates the actual pumping mechanism (and makes your life easier). It can’t run a car, but it gets the job done.

<p>Note: Click on Packadoo sizes to see weight suggestions for your doggo!</p>
<p>I'm a co-parent of twin human babies and two very non-twin fur buddies. We love taking our dogs to explore the great outdoors. Unfortunately, anyone who walks in an area or trail where dogs are common can agree: poop is a problem. Studies have shown that people are only willing to walk 75 feet to throw away garbage. Now compare a dirty napkin to a warm, stinky bag of the brown stuff. This is why there's an epoodemic (see what I did... never mind) of number 2 and even BAGGED poops littered all around our beautiful neighborhoods and hiking trails.</p>
<p>But what if you could do the right thing AND not have to carry that miserable bag of squishy buzzkill? ENTER THE <strong>PACKADOO</strong>. Simply bag it up like normal (preferably in a biodegradeable bag), put the bag in your Packadoo, clip it to your dog's harness or collar, and let that rascal carry their own mess! Boom. You're free to enjoy your adventure, AND feel like an amazing citizen of a suddenly more beautiful planet. Later, either toss the bag when you see a can or dumpster, or bury it in your own compost. We've done our testing and can promise: they don't mind carrying it as much as you do. Help us make the world a little less poopy... With <strong>PACKADOO</strong>!</p>
<p>Final product will be slightly more stylized and branded (cool) than the prototypes shown here. Manufacturing is already arranged and Packadoo will be <strong>MADE IN THE USA</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>- We are producing four sizes of the Packadoo for different sized dogs. Between the cost of the molds and minimum manufacturing number of each size, sales tax and Indiegogo fees,  our cost to get launched is just under $60,000.</p>
<p>- Our perks include your choice of any of the Packadoo sizes and/or our custom sticker. They will be in different colors, but due to limitations, we won't be able to take color requests.</p>
<p>- If we don't reach our goal, money will be refunded and we'll try another route to market.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>- For anyone who walks or hikes with their dog, this makes carrying their poop out with you a completely painless experience.</p>
<p>- When this product becomes popular among dog owners, there will be a visible (and ""smellable"") improvement in our public dog areas. Our ultimate dream is to see more areas opened up to dogs because of more responsible owners enabled by Packadoo.</p>
<p>- With our manufacturing being already arranged, this campaign will make it possible to get your Packadoo to you &amp; your loved ones in time for the holidays.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Our campaign budget is pretty straightforward and our working prototypes have proven successful. The only forseeable risks for us would be issues with the USPS. However, we believe they will continue to operate as usual and delivery to our supporters will be efficient and painless.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>- You may not have a dog, or may be strapped for cash (thanks Covid!) but you can still help!</p>
<p>- share our link on your social media and make some noise about Packadoo.</p>
<p>  use the super helpful Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>- We're offering a fun custom sticker for $7 that you can use to remind others to ""pick it up!""</p>

Simply bag it up like normal (preferably in a biodegradeable bag), put the bag in your Packadoo, clip it to your dog's harness or collar, and let that rascal carry their own mess! Boom. You're free to enjoy your adventure, AND feel like an amazing citizen of a suddenly more beautiful planet. Later, either toss the bag when you see a can or dumpster, or bury it in your own compost. We've done our testing and can promise: they don't mind carrying it as much as you do. Help us make the world a little less poopy... With PACKADOO!
Final product will be slightly more stylized and branded (cool) than the prototypes shown here. Manufacturing is already arranged and Packadoo will be MADE IN THE USA. 
What We Need & What You Get
- We are producing four sizes of the Packadoo for different sized dogs. Between the cost of the molds and minimum manufacturing number of each size, sales tax and Indiegogo fees,  our cost to get launched is just under $60,000.
- Our perks include your choice of any of the Packadoo sizes and/or our custom sticker. They will be in different colors, but due to limitations, we won't be able to take color requests.
- If we don't reach our goal, money will be refunded and we'll try another route to market.
The Impact
- For anyone who walks or hikes with their dog, this makes carrying their poop out with you a completely painless experience.
- When this product becomes popular among dog owners, there will be a visible (and ""smellable"") improvement in our public dog areas. Our ultimate dream is to see more areas opened up to dogs because of more responsible owners enabled by Packadoo.
- With our manufacturing being already arranged, this campaign will make it possible to get your Packadoo to you & your loved ones in time for the holidays.
Risks & Challenges
Our campaign budget is pretty straightforward and our working prototypes have proven successful. The only forseeable risks for us would be issues with the USPS. However, we believe they will continue to operate as usual and delivery to our supporters will be efficient and painless.
Other Ways You Can Help
- You may not have a dog, or may be strapped for cash (thanks Covid!) but you can still help!
- share our link on your social media and make some noise about Packadoo.
  use the super helpful Indiegogo share tools!
- We're offering a fun custom sticker for $7 that you can use to remind others to ""pick it up!""",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Although digital FPV solutions that could eliminate all of the above issues are available, here are the main reasons why FPV Flying enthusiasts still use analog technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Low latency<br/></strong>Analog links often have a low latency. Digital solutions usually need buffering or use inter-frame compression algorithms (H.264 / MPEG4) that are not built for low latency video or unreliable connections. Furthermore they are transferred on network protocols that are not suitable for real time video transfer (e.g. TCP).</li>
<li>
<strong>Reliability<br/></strong>Analog video is known to “just work” and even if it doesn’t work, it usually does not stop completely but just gives you noisy or distorted images. Digital solutions on the other hand are often not fault tolerant. Image errors often make the image unrecognizable or would require re-transmission of faulty video-frames which makes a live transmission impossible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Price<br/></strong>Analog solutions are cheap compared to Digital Video solutions that are currently on the market. Many of the available digital CODFM based systems target the military sector and cost multiple thousand dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sky Drone FPV solution combines the reliability, low latency and low price of an analog FPV system with the video quality of a digital FPV system!</p>

<p>You are probably wondering, if it's all so simple, why hasn't this been done before? After all, there are some commonly known problems with live video transmission over 3G/4G networks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carriers often only provide heavily firewalled 3G/4G connections</li>
<li>Bandwidth can vary greatly from second to second</li>
<li>When routed via multiple hops there is a high latency</li>
<li>Transmission methods and compression algorithms weren't designed for 3G/4G networks</li>
<li>Link Reliability</li>
</ul>
<p>After more than a year of research, development and testing we've have solved the above mentioned problems and have come up with some clever solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a customized video format streamed via UDP to achieve low latency.</li>
<li>Using NAT Traversal / “hole punching” techniques to create a direct peer to peer connection even if the link is firewalled.</li>
<li>Custom USB camera driver to allow frame by frame resolution changes to quickly adapt to bandwidth demands.</li>
<li>Mediation Server to let both peers find each other.</li>
<li>Fallback to proprietary Proxy Server if NAT Traversal / “hole punching” fails to establish a direct connection.</li>
<li>Synchronization mechanism guaranties that the MAVLink telemetry data matches video timestamp.</li>
<li>FPV pilot safety features:</li>
<ul>
<li>Auto-reconnect</li>
<li>Configurable alarms in ground station</li>
<li>An auto-bandwidth adaptation mechanism can instantly change frame rate, resolution and compression parameters to guarantee a snappy video stream even on very slow connections.</li>
<li>Current Latency displayed on HUD</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://skydrone.indiegogo.s3.amazonaws.com/headers/header-7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The Sky Drone FPV system is a great solution for any FPV flying enthusiast. However, in achieving a low cost, reliable digital solutions we had to make some tradeoffs:</p>
<ul>
<li>You always need Cell Tower coverage. So if you have plans flying in the Gobi Desert or on the South Pole, you probably want to use a different FPV solution.</li>
<li>A data flat rate or high volume contract is highly recommended to avoid costly phone bills.</li>
<li>You need a smartphone or tablet running either Android, iOS or BlackBerry 10 / PlayBook Tablet OS (but we assume this won't be much of an issue).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://skydrone.indiegogo.s3.amazonaws.com/headers/header-8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The FPV system works flawlessly as of today. However, in order to finish the “final” product and start production we still have some work to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still Image functionality is not finished yet</li>
<li>Our current development platform is BlackBerry. We still need to port the ground station application to Android &amp; iOS. As the UI is mainly OpenGL ES based we expect the porting process to be relatively straightforward.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Stretch Goals - if we get more funding than our initial funding goal we will add:</p>
<ul>
<li>on-groundstation video recording</li>
<li>on-device video recording</li>
<li>augmented reality overlays</li>
<li>Oculus Rift Support (starting with 2D)</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://skydrone.indiegogo.s3.amazonaws.com/headers/header-9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>We have put our heart and soul and a staggering amount of work in the project. To take the last hurdles we need you to support us. The financial support will cover the production costs and contributes to the remaining development.</p>
<p>Schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>September: obtain funding</li>
<li>October: Finish Still Image Functionality + some tweaks</li>
<li>November: Port Ground Station Application to Android &amp; iOS</li>
<li>December: App Store Submissions &amp; Deliver final product</li>

<p><strong>Project Risks: <br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This project is challenging on the software side. On the hardware side we only use standard components.</li>
<li>Hardware sourcing won't be in issue. We're based in Hong Kong, The world's largest electronics manufacturing factories are just next door.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technology risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a direct peer-to-peer connection fails and our proxy infrastructure is used, the latency will be higher and fly by wire / autopilot assisted flight is recommended. This might happen if different carriers are used. To prevent this we recommend to use SIM cards from the same carrier on both sides.</li>
<li>Safety issues: your carrier might stop the connection after a bandwidth limit has been reached. Make sure to get a contract that does not shut off the connection. It is no problem if your carrier lowers the bandwidth after a certain amount of data transfer is reached though.</li>
<li>Cell congestion / availability might unexpectedly lower the video quality.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: How much data is usually been transmitted per hour?</b></p>
<p>A: With good HD quality at 30 fps you will run through 5GB of data within one hour.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Does 4G/LTE provide enough bandwidth? How can I increase it?</b></p>
<p>A: 
4G/LTE networks are capable of carrying full-HD
(1920x1080p with 30fps). The Sky Drone FPV software automatically adjusts to the network's capabilities and always tries to ensure a smooth video stream. </p>
<p><b>Q: Does the cellular network cause high latency?</b></p>
<p>A: No, in fact it does not. There is a lot of prejudice in cellular networks and their latency these days. In extensive network tests we have discovered that ordinary ""ping"" latency between two endpoints is usually around 20 milliseconds. However, this is only the network latency and does not include any payload (video+telemetry) yet. Our goal is to deliver a FPV system that comes with less than 150ms End-To-End Latency by using cellular (3G, 4G/LTE) networks. 
We are already very close to this. You can check out
our latency test info in the “Updates” section of our campaign.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is there any way to control my drone / UAV with this?</b></p>
<p>A: No. This is a FPV system only. It allows you to see what the drone is seeing in real-time with virtually unlimited range. While telemetry data is also being transmitted from the UAV to the groundstation app, controlling the UAV through the groundstation app is currently not available.</p>
<p><b>Q: Will you publish the source code as Open Source?</b></p>
<p>A: We truly believe in open standards like POSIX, AES, MAVLink and we are building our software to be compatible with those open standards. At a later stage we will be evaluating which parts of our software we might publish as open source. Right now we do not have any immediate plans for that, though.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I use this with my analog video gear?</b></p>
<p>A: As mentioned in the video, we are using a BlackBerry PlayBook to run our groundstation app. The PlayBook, BlackBerry 10 phones as well as some Android devices have a micro-HDMI output which can be used with any standard HDMI-to-Analog converter for example. So it should be rather easy to hook that up to your analog gear and view the output on there. 
For high quality and lowest latency we highly
recommend digital video gear though.</p>
<p><b>Q: How is it NSA proof?</b></p>
<p>A: We wrap our custom built video codec and telemetry stream into a AES-256 encrypted data channel. ""AES is available in many different encryption packages, and is the first publicly accessible and open cipher approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for top secret information when used in an NSA approved cryptographic module."" source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES-256"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES-256</a></p>
<p>The security of AES-encrypted data only depends on keeping the cypher secret while the encryption algorithm is public. You can read more about the security aspects of AES on Wikipedia in the ""Security"" section of the AES article: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#Security"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#Security</a></p>
<p><b>Q: Which drone / UAV is included?</b></p>
<p>A: The Sky Drone FPV set is a FPV (first person view) system only. Therefore, it only includes the camera, controller, usb hub, 3G/4G/LTE modem, cabling for such and the Sky Drone FPV software as well as access to the groundstation app for BlackBerry, Android and iOS.</p>

Digital solutions usually need buffering or use inter-frame compression algorithms (H.264 / MPEG4) that are not built for low latency video or unreliable connections. Furthermore they are transferred on network protocols that are not suitable for real time video transfer (e.g. TCP).

ReliabilityAnalog video is known to “just work” and even if it doesn’t work, it usually does not stop completely but just gives you noisy or distorted images. Digital solutions on the other hand are often not fault tolerant. Image errors often make the image unrecognizable or would require re-transmission of faulty video-frames which makes a live transmission impossible.

PriceAnalog solutions are cheap compared to Digital Video solutions that are currently on the market. Many of the available digital CODFM based systems target the military sector and cost multiple thousand dollars.

The Sky Drone FPV solution combines the reliability, low latency and low price of an analog FPV system with the video quality of a digital FPV system!


 


The Sky Drone FPV system is optimized for FPV flying but can be used standalone for any use case e.g. remote controlled ground vehicles; you can put it in a car for vehicle remote monitoring; as a security cam; …

The Sky Drone FPV groundstation provides you with a low latency First Person View and an optional HUD Overlay. The telemetry data to be displayed is highly configurable. Furthermore it allows the user to set up alarms to ensure safety. By clicking the photo button a high resolution still photo is captured and transmitted to the groundstation in the background.

You are probably wondering, if it's all so simple, why hasn't this been done before? After all, there are some commonly known problems with live video transmission over 3G/4G networks:

Carriers often only provide heavily firewalled 3G/4G connections
Bandwidth can vary greatly from second to second
When routed via multiple hops there is a high latency
Transmission methods and compression algorithms weren't designed for 3G/4G networks
Link Reliability

After more than a year of research, development and testing we've have solved the above mentioned problems and have come up with some clever solutions:

Using a customized video format streamed via UDP to achieve low latency.
Using NAT Traversal / “hole punching” techniques to create a direct peer to peer connection even if the link is firewalled.
Custom USB camera driver to allow frame by frame resolution changes to quickly adapt to bandwidth demands.
Mediation Server to let both peers find each other.
Fallback to proprietary Proxy Server if NAT Traversal / “hole punching” fails to establish a direct connection.
Synchronization mechanism guaranties that the MAVLink telemetry data matches video timestamp.
FPV pilot safety features:

Auto-reconnect
Configurable alarms in ground station
An auto-bandwidth adaptation mechanism can instantly change frame rate, resolution and compression parameters to guarantee a snappy video stream even on very slow connections.

The Sky Drone FPV system is a great solution for any FPV flying enthusiast. However, in achieving a low cost, reliable digital solutions we had to make some tradeoffs:

You always need Cell Tower coverage. So if you have plans flying in the Gobi Desert or on the South Pole, you probably want to use a different FPV solution.
A data flat rate or high volume contract is highly recommended to avoid costly phone bills.
You need a smartphone or tablet running either Android, iOS or BlackBerry 10 / PlayBook Tablet OS (but we assume this won't be much of an issue).

 


 
The FPV system works flawlessly as of today. However, in order to finish the “final” product and start production we still have some work to do:

Still Image functionality is not finished yet
Our current development platform is BlackBerry. We still need to port the ground station application to Android & iOS. As the UI is mainly OpenGL ES based we expect the porting process to be relatively straightforward.

Stretch Goals - if we get more funding than our initial funding goal we will add:

on-groundstation video recording
on-device video recording
augmented reality overlays
Oculus Rift Support (starting with 2D)

  

We have put our heart and soul and a staggering amount of work in the project. To take the last hurdles we need you to support us. The financial support will cover the production costs and contributes to the remaining development.
Schedule:

September: obtain funding
October: Finish Still Image Functionality + some tweaks
November: Port Ground Station Application to Android & iOS
December: App Store Submissions & Deliver final product

 

 

Project Risks: 

This project is challenging on the software side. On the hardware side we only use standard components.
Hardware sourcing won't be in issue. We're based in Hong Kong, The world's largest electronics manufacturing factories are just next door.

Technology risks:

If a direct peer-to-peer connection fails and our proxy infrastructure is used, the latency will be higher and fly by wire / autopilot assisted flight is recommended. This might happen if different carriers are used. To prevent this we recommend to use SIM cards from the same carrier on both sides.
Safety issues: your carrier might stop the connection after a bandwidth limit has been reached. Make sure to get a contract that does not shut off the connection. It is no problem if your carrier lowers the bandwidth after a certain amount of data transfer is reached though.
Cell congestion / availability might unexpectedly lower the video quality.






Q: How much data is usually been transmitted per hour?
A: With good HD quality at 30 fps you will run through 5GB of data within one hour.

Q: Does 4G/LTE provide enough bandwidth? How can I increase it?
A: 
4G/LTE networks are capable of carrying full-HD
(1920x1080p with 30fps). The Sky Drone FPV software automatically adjusts to the network's capabilities and always tries to ensure a smooth video stream. 
Q: Does the cellular network cause high latency?
A: No, in fact it does not. There is a lot of prejudice in cellular networks and their latency these days. In extensive network tests we have discovered that ordinary ""ping"" latency between two endpoints is usually around 20 milliseconds. However, this is only the network latency and does not include any payload (video+telemetry) yet. Our goal is to deliver a FPV system that comes with less than 150ms End-To-End Latency by using cellular (3G, 4G/LTE) networks. 
We are already very close to this. You can check out
our latency test info in the “Updates” section of our campaign.
Q: Is there any way to control my drone / UAV with this?
A: No. This is a FPV system only. It allows you to see what the drone is seeing in real-time with virtually unlimited range. While telemetry data is also being transmitted from the UAV to the groundstation app, controlling the UAV through the groundstation app is currently not available.
Q: Will you publish the source code as Open Source?
A: We truly believe in open standards like POSIX, AES, MAVLink and we are building our software to be compatible with those open standards. At a later stage we will be evaluating which parts of our software we might publish as open source. Right now we do not have any immediate plans for that, though.
Q: Can I use this with my analog video gear?
A: As mentioned in the video, we are using a BlackBerry PlayBook to run our groundstation app. The PlayBook, BlackBerry 10 phones as well as some Android devices have a micro-HDMI output which can be used with any standard HDMI-to-Analog converter for example. So it should be rather easy to hook that up to your analog gear and view the output on there. 
For high quality and lowest latency we highly
recommend digital video gear though.
Q: How is it NSA proof?
A: We wrap our custom built video codec and telemetry stream into a AES-256 encrypted data channel. ""AES is available in many different encryption packages, and is the first publicly accessible and open cipher approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) for top secret information when used in an NSA approved cryptographic module."" source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES-256
The security of AES-encrypted data only depends on keeping the cypher secret while the encryption algorithm is public. You can read more about the security aspects of AES on Wikipedia in the ""Security"" section of the AES article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard#Security
Q: Which drone / UAV is included?
A: The Sky Drone FPV set is a FPV (first person view) system only. Therefore, it only includes the camera, controller, usb hub, 3G/4G/LTE modem, cabling for such and the Sky Drone FPV software as well as access to the groundstation app for BlackBerry, Android and iOS.

Unfortunately, stainless steel bottles lacked squeezability, while squeezable plastic bottles lacked the BPA-free water that is healthiest for our bodies.</p><p>RIPURI includes the amazing functionality of a squeezable center while still offering the durability that a stainless steel water bottle provides. An evolution in drinking on-the-go, you will see just how convenient it is on your next outdoor adventure!</p><p><strong>4) ERGONOMIC SILICONE MOUTHPIECE</strong></p><p>We wanted to create the perfect mouthpiece for RIPURI. One that felt great on your lips, while providing excellent water flow to keep you hydrated.

<p>Hey there fellow sports enthusiasts, Nic here representing Hat Trick Lacrosse working to bring a brand new piece of lacrosse equipment to the market place. For the past year we have been working with an optical engineer to create an optically correct form fitting helmet visor for the sport of Lacrosse.</p>
<p>A protective helmet visor is nothing new, they have been around for a while and been made most notably for sports like football and hockey. The problem is when it comes to lacrosse, there are zero visors that are made to be worn with a modern day lacrosse helmet!</p>
<p>There are many reasons why someone would want a helmet visor while playing Lacrosse, shielding the eyes from the elements and debris such as turf rubber, rain, cold, dirt, sun, glare. Another reason someone would want a helmet visor is for aesthetics, lets be honest, a tinted face mask looks intimidating! The aesthetics of the visor always has been, and will continue to be of great importance to the company. When working with engineers to design this project, we had two main objectives, create a visor that is engineered with optically correct geometry &amp; make sure the visor is form fitting and will look sleek on a helmet.</p>

<p>Like we said before the technology of a helmet visor is nothing new, safety lenses have a variety of applications such as construction, military, sports, consumer wear, aviation, ect. The polymer of choice for safety lenses is Polycarbonate, a nearly shatterproof plastic that is incredibly versatile. To ensure this visor would function as an optical piece, we worked with an optical engineering firm located just outside of Seattle. With their expertise, we have created a truly form fitting optically correct Helmet visor.</p>
<p>Our first model Visor will ONLY fit on the Cascade Pro 7.  Again, This visor is designed to fit perfectly into the Cascade Pro 7 model helmet.  We are already working on a visor to fit the Cascade CPX-R as well as other brand helmets, but for now we have focused on bringing this first Pro 7 model to production.</p>

<p>What we are asking for?</p>
<p>We are seeking funding to help pay for the high sunk cost of manufacturing this product. The best way to manufacture optical parts is by injection molding.

<p>With your help, we hope to get this project up and running, we have a lot of cool ideas we plan on bringing to the market, with tint colors and coatings to advance the sports of lacrosse.</p>

<br/>
<i> <div style=""font-weight: bold;""><i><b>""The GoVe™ stretches the imagination and it expands the conventional way of traveling.""  - Rod Blair, Inventor</b></i></div>
<br/></i> Recreational and work application uses are limitless. <br/><br/>
<div>Drive through water, mud, ice, marshes/everglades, sand, snow, rocky terrain, and even on the wide open ocean. The GoVe™ drone can be dropped from a plane and inflate in midair prior to landing. </div> <blockquote>The original concept came from watching a life guard on the beach fight against the surf to help someone. Why not just send a GoVe™ drone out that can drop a ring or raft in order to immediately help them. In situations where tide is too high or the surf is impossible for an individual to get through, sending the GoVe™ drone will help identify and assist how rescuers can be prepared and equipped to respond.</blockquote> <blockquote> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467232128/Screen_Shot_2016-06-29_at_1.28.24_PM_ecga1a.png"" src="""" style=""width: 372.72727272727275px;height: 328px;""/><span><br/></span>
</blockquote> <blockquote>The inventor of the GoVe™ drone had a strong interest in ice rescue. When conceptualizing the applications for the GoVe™ drone, he wanted to create a device that was capable of saving a person's life when trapped in ice, without risking the life of a rescue respondent. The difficulties in ice rescue is that the ice can break as soon as you crawl on top of the surface, and fall through. If the ice cracks with the GoVe™ drone, the pilot of the GoVe™ drone can continue to propel it towards the victim and provide aid.</blockquote>
</div>
<div>Use the GoVe™ for adventure. Make home movies by utilizing the 360-degree feature. Capture every moment of those thrill seeking experiences.  <br/><blockquote>Imagine as a video producer, you can have five GoVe™'s all with 360 cameras, getting angled shots you can't get anywhere else. In water scenes, adventure scenes, by taking the GoVe™ right behind the actor obtaining a more dynamic view point. You don't have to have an expensive helicopter, or boat, there are unlimited uses at a very low cost.</blockquote> The GoVe™ drone is compact, small enough to fit in the trunk of a car, and can be easily assembled after inflation onsite. <b>The GoVe™ drone was designed to be scalable.</b> It can be made big enough for an individual pilot to ride, or it can be made small enough to drive remotely.  </div><br/>

<h4><b>FAQs:</b></h4>
<p><b>What do you mean by all surface drone?</b></p>
<p>GoVe™ is the only drone capable of driving through mud, snow, ice, sand, rocks and even water. No other drone can quickly and safely go from land or ice to water at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p><b>Why not just use a flying drone?</b></p>
<p>Flying drones typically have trouble in bad weather and limited ranges because of their weight restrictions or FAA regulations. With the GoVe™ we will be able to carry much heavier payloads for longer distances and longer periods of time in all kinds of weather.</p>
<p><b>What are the applications?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The GoVe™ is a unique remotely controlled all surface drone capable of driving through mud, ice, snow, marshes, everglades, sand, rocky terrain and even the wide open ocean. This makes it perfect for rescue missions, package delivery, recreation, adventure, and cinematography. </p>
<p><b>How long will I be able to use the </b><b>GoVe™ on a single charge?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thanks to lithium technology in the GoVe™'s batteries you will be able to drive around for up to 50 minutes at a time. The rechargeable battery packs are easily switched out to keep the fun going.</p>
<p><b>What kind of cameras and equipment can I mount on the </b><b>GoVe™? </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A variety of sensor and camera capabilities will be integrated into GoVe™'s electronics. You can use sports cameras, thermal sensors, motion sensors, custom payloads or enough controls to make it autonomous. </p>
<p><b>Can you swap out power sources like batteries or gasoline engines?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At this time we are not able to swap out power sources for the GoVe™. We will be developing the electric and gas versions separately. </p>
<p><b>Is the </b><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;"">GoVe™</span><b> environmentally friendly or green?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Yes. The low-pressure footprint on solid surfaces would allow the craft to <b>travel in environmentally sensitive areas without compaction</b>. Due to the nature of the craft, there is limited hull drag under propulsion so surface speeds can be extreme <b>on the water up to 80mph</b>. Even at such high speeds, there is no need for a cooling exhaust that would put hydrocarbons in the water. In areas where propellers or jets are used, there would be <b>no clogging or entanglement</b> with the environment that would disrupt local habitats. </p>
<p><b>How does it work?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The GoVe™ can be manually piloted or remotely controlled.  Each wheel is powered independently, making it easier to maneuver and giving it a unique braking system which uses the reverse operation mode. Since the center of gravity of the craft is below the center plane there is no effective way to capsize the craft. It can be outfitted with powerful cameras and sensors for all sorts of adventures, reconnaissance, surveying, data collection and custom package or payload delivery. </p>
<p><b>How big is it?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>GoVe™ is inherently simple to operate and can be made compact enough to go into the trunk of a vehicle. The first production versions will be about the size of a small dog but the GoVe™ was also designed to be scalable. We can make the GoVe™ big enough for people to ride in; you could replace both your <b>Rhino™</b> and Jet Ski with a single GoVe™. </p>
<p><b>What is the funding for? </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At this time, the GoVe™ drone has been designed and a working prototype has been built. With the funds raised, we will be able to miniaturize the electrical components, select the optimum batteries and develop the motors along with their respective drive trains. The rest of the funding will go towards building the first production versions. The heavy lifting has been done, now it’s just a matter of delivering so other people can benefit from it.  </p>
<p><b>How do I order my </b><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;"">GoVe™</span><b>? </b></p>
<p>You can be among the first to receive a GoVe™ drone  if you select the $3,000 donation option in the perks section. </p>

GoVe™ : Application


 ""The GoVe™ stretches the imagination and it expands the conventional way of traveling.""  - Rod Blair, Inventor
 Recreational and work application uses are limitless. 
Drive through water, mud, ice, marshes/everglades, sand, snow, rocky terrain, and even on the wide open ocean. The GoVe™ drone can be dropped from a plane and inflate in midair prior to landing.  The original concept came from watching a life guard on the beach fight against the surf to help someone. Why not just send a GoVe™ drone out that can drop a ring or raft in order to immediately help them. In situations where tide is too high or the surf is impossible for an individual to get through, sending the GoVe™ drone will help identify and assist how rescuers can be prepared and equipped to respond.  
 The inventor of the GoVe™ drone had a strong interest in ice rescue. When conceptualizing the applications for the GoVe™ drone, he wanted to create a device that was capable of saving a person's life when trapped in ice, without risking the life of a rescue respondent. The difficulties in ice rescue is that the ice can break as soon as you crawl on top of the surface, and fall through. If the ice cracks with the GoVe™ drone, the pilot of the GoVe™ drone can continue to propel it towards the victim and provide aid.

Use the GoVe™ for adventure. Make home movies by utilizing the 360-degree feature. Capture every moment of those thrill seeking experiences.  Imagine as a video producer, you can have five GoVe™'s all with 360 cameras, getting angled shots you can't get anywhere else. In water scenes, adventure scenes, by taking the GoVe™ right behind the actor obtaining a more dynamic view point. You don't have to have an expensive helicopter, or boat, there are unlimited uses at a very low cost. The GoVe™ drone is compact, small enough to fit in the trunk of a car, and can be easily assembled after inflation onsite. The GoVe™ drone was designed to be scalable. It can be made big enough for an individual pilot to ride, or it can be made small enough to drive remotely.

GoVe™ drone: How it works 

 

·  Suitable power sources include gasoline, alcohol, batteries and fuel cells.
· 50 min charge time on battery operated ASD 
·  Each wheel is powered independently forward and reverse 
·  Outfitted with cameras, sensors, or custom payloads 
·  Radio controlled with Wi-Fi & Bluetooth enabled
·  Speeds up to 80 mph 
·  Center of gravity is below the center plane, so it’s self-righting (cannot be flipped)
·  Can be deployed from an aircraft
·Suitable for propulsion with various power sources from JP, gasoline, alcohol, batteries, fuel cells, or propane  

GoVe™ drone: Going Green


It is environmentally friendly. The low-pressure footprint on any surfaces would allow the craft to travel in environmentally sensitive areas without compaction.No exhausts are transmitted through the water, so hydrocarbon contamination will not come in contact with the water or vegetation. 


 




GoVe™ drone: Funding Expectations
·  Miniaturize the electrical components 

·  Select the optimum for batteries and motors

·  Manufacturing and tooling 

·  Programming 

·  App development

We are seeking sponsors to produce a larger GoVe™ for an individual to pilot and set the precedent for the first all surface vehicle (ASV). 

We invite you to be part of this experience. This is an amazing opportunity to be at the forefront of technology, as well as support an eco-friendly initiative. Your contribution will go a long way in making the GoVe™  a reality. Within three -six months of receiving the full funding we need, we will be able to produce the first batch of the GoVe™ drone , and place this exciting product within your reach.

FAQs:
What do you mean by all surface drone?
GoVe™ is the only drone capable of driving through mud, snow, ice, sand, rocks and even water. No other drone can quickly and safely go from land or ice to water at a moment’s notice.
Why not just use a flying drone?
Flying drones typically have trouble in bad weather and limited ranges because of their weight restrictions or FAA regulations. With the GoVe™ we will be able to carry much heavier payloads for longer distances and longer periods of time in all kinds of weather.
What are the applications?


The GoVe™ is a unique remotely controlled all surface drone capable of driving through mud, ice, snow, marshes, everglades, sand, rocky terrain and even the wide open ocean. This makes it perfect for rescue missions, package delivery, recreation, adventure, and cinematography. 
How long will I be able to use the GoVe™ on a single charge?


Thanks to lithium technology in the GoVe™'s batteries you will be able to drive around for up to 50 minutes at a time. The rechargeable battery packs are easily switched out to keep the fun going.
What kind of cameras and equipment can I mount on the GoVe™? 


A variety of sensor and camera capabilities will be integrated into GoVe™'s electronics. You can use sports cameras, thermal sensors, motion sensors, custom payloads or enough controls to make it autonomous. 
Can you swap out power sources like batteries or gasoline engines?


At this time we are not able to swap out power sources for the GoVe™. We will be developing the electric and gas versions separately. 
Is the GoVe™ environmentally friendly or green?


Yes. The low-pressure footprint on solid surfaces would allow the craft to travel in environmentally sensitive areas without compaction. Due to the nature of the craft, there is limited hull drag under propulsion so surface speeds can be extreme on the water up to 80mph. Even at such high speeds, there is no need for a cooling exhaust that would put hydrocarbons in the water. In areas where propellers or jets are used, there would be no clogging or entanglement with the environment that would disrupt local habitats. 
How does it work?


The GoVe™ can be manually piloted or remotely controlled.  Each wheel is powered independently, making it easier to maneuver and giving it a unique braking system which uses the reverse operation mode. Since the center of gravity of the craft is below the center plane there is no effective way to capsize the craft. It can be outfitted with powerful cameras and sensors for all sorts of adventures, reconnaissance, surveying, data collection and custom package or payload delivery. 
How big is it?


GoVe™ is inherently simple to operate and can be made compact enough to go into the trunk of a vehicle. The first production versions will be about the size of a small dog but the GoVe™ was also designed to be scalable. We can make the GoVe™ big enough for people to ride in; you could replace both your Rhino™ and Jet Ski with a single GoVe™. 
What is the funding for? 


At this time, the GoVe™ drone has been designed and a working prototype has been built. With the funds raised, we will be able to miniaturize the electrical components, select the optimum batteries and develop the motors along with their respective drive trains. The rest of the funding will go towards building the first production versions. The heavy lifting has been done, now it’s just a matter of delivering so other people can benefit from it.  
How do I order my GoVe™? 
You can be among the first to receive a GoVe™ drone  if you select the $3,000 donation option in the perks section.

Easy Drone XL Pro can easily lift a mirrorless back camera on a gimbal with combined weight of up to 3 lbs (1.4 Kg). Check below for a list of example cameras you could use. 


What stayed the same?
Same modular design - Easy Drone XL Pro has the same modular design as the previous versions L and XL that allows it to fit into the same size backpack. 


Same Control Unit - Even though the new Fly Bot has some new and upgraded features it is still backwards compatible with all our previous frame versions. Same goes for our previous FlyBots - they can be used with the new frame with a simple wireless profile update.
Same Travel Backpack - The XL Pro still fits in the same backpack that pack the L and XL. If you happen to own one of our previous versions all you need is a custom insert for XL Pro.

<p>Our goal is to work with organizations like The Ocean Cleanup, Greenpeace, and 4Ocean as they are on the cutting edge of technology and in need of as much assistance as possible. Today we are actively working in the local Columbia area trying to do our part. If you are interested in joining us please send us an email.</p>

It's not breaking news...
Trash is a serious problem that affects the health of people, wildlife, local business and the surrounding areas. Trash in the water and on the shore can harm and or kill marine animals, birds, injure swimmers and beach goers. By 2050, plastic in the oceans will outweigh, predicts a report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, in partnership with the World Economic.

We've done away with a lot of the rubbish that's included in typical First Aid kits.

</div><div>
<p>We have funded the costs of prototyping this kit and now have this at a level where we're ready for production.

<h3>Where the Idea Came From</h3>
<p>The Travel Halo was born after lots of traveling, sore necks and sleepless flights. I have always loved to travel. But I’ve never been able to fall asleep in the car or on a plane. I’ve tried almost every travel pillow on the market with little relief. Regular c-shaped “neck pillows” just don’t work. They still allow your head to move, and neck to bend. And they're not very ergonomic. Just about everyone has tried a conventional travel/neck pillow, but I’ve yet to meet anyone who says they like them.</p>
<p>So, one day after riding shotgun during a long and sleepless car ride, I had the idea. I jumped out of the car, grabbed some old socks, an old tennis headband, lots of tape, and here’s what I came up with:</p>
<p><img alt=""Pictures of the design and development process"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16274810/TH%20Indiegogo%20Images/Dev%20Pictures.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""dev pictures""/></p>
<p><span>It was truly ugly, but it worked well! I spent the next year and a half fine tuning the design, researching materials, and finding an appropriate manufacuturer who could produce something to my standards.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Travel Halo is for People Who:</strong></h3>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Like things that actually work</li>
<li>Can't sleep while traveling or sitting up</li>
<li>Don't want to turn into a travel zombie</li>
</ul><p><img alt=""Travel Halo vs. other travel pillows comparison image"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16274810/TH%20Indiegogo%20Images/side%20by%20side.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Travel Halo vs. the other guys""/></p>
<h3>The Design</h3>
<p>I have spent the last two years testing dozens of different designs and materials with one goal in mind: create a comfortable and easy to use travel pillow that actually works. </p>
<p><img alt=""travel halo Patent drawings"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16274810/TH%20Indiegogo%20Images/patent%20drawings.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""patent drawings""/></p>
<p><span>The Travel Halo is made from a high quality polyester/spandex blend sports cloth. The material is very breathable, lightweight and soft to the touch providing maximum comfort. The Travel Halo features a stretchable band designed to fit any head-size. Two cotton pillows, secured inside the band, are positioned so that they cradle your head and prevent it from rolling to either side while you sleep. </span></p>
<p><span>When traveling, I often found myself trying to sleep in brightly lit environments with little success. To address this, the Travel Halo includes a fold-down eye mask to block out ambient light. </span></p>
<p>The Travel Halo is designed with portability in mind. It sports a super comact, minimalist design that folds up easily when not in use. It can then be stored in the travel pouch included with every Travel Halo.</p>

<h3>Help me help you sleep better!</h3>
<p>I have the final design, prototypes and pre-production samples finished. I need your help to make sure that I can meet the minimum order quantity (MOQ) required by the manufacturer to go into production. Our website and interested retailers are ready. Your pledge will help me get our first full-scale production run under way and bring the Travel Halo to market!</p>
<p>To have the minimum pieces produced to get this project off the ground translates to about $35,000 - our funding goal. This money will be used exclusively for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing, production and associated costs</li>
<li>Packaging design and production</li>
<li>Shipping costs and materials</li>
</ul><p>Please know that this campaign is all-or-nothing; meaning if we are unable to meet our funding goal, no money will be collected.</p>
<p>So please back this project! We have some awesome rewards for our backers ranging from the limited edition travel mug (below) to a Travel Halo from our first big production run!</p>

</li></ul>
<p>The U.S. and China  announced an agreement on November 10 2014
that will lengthen the term of tourist visas from 1 year to 10 years. That
means that as long as Chinese travelers apply for their visas for one time, they can
travel to United States for the next ten years whenever they want. That will
bring a huge convenience for the Chinese travelers meaning that there will be more
Chinese travelers visiting the U.S. for their second or third time. They may want a different travel experience upon their second or third visit. Our company
can meet their needs.</p>

services:</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Our services are internet based, concentrating on Chinese travelers
who want travel to the U.S. by themselves. Initially our services will begin in
Florida, then expand to other states in the U.S.. We will offer all the famous travel locations in Florida and unique
events such as bicycle renting, diving services, fishing services, and even
experiencing local U.S. culture by living with American families. Customers can choose
their desired locations and unique events in the U.S. and our company will help
them make those travel ideas come true. Our services will allow foreign
travelers to gain unique travel experiences not offered by generalized travel
agencies.</p>
<p>Presently, our online travel services is in the introductory stage.
It will become a travel innovation for modern people. It competes primarily
based on our unique travel services and one to one travel planning for Chinese
travelers.  </p>

market:</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Our target market will be Chinese travelers. The total amount of
Chinese travelers in the U.S. was approximately 1.8 million in 2013. New
Chinese travelers are travel- savvy, well-educated, and mostly under 45 years of
age. </p>
<p>This number is expected to grow by 20% per year. As of now, no particular
travel agencies offer this kind of travel experience to consumers so we are
the first. What’s more, due to the new 10 year travel visa, many customers must
be second, third, or even fourth time travelers to the U.S. These customers may desire
different experiences and truly gain the feeling of what it’s like to live with
an American family for several days.</p>

</li></ul>
<p>Our main competitions are travel agencies already in existence. They
offer broad travel packages to consumers such as: Florida 10 day travel
package, it includes everything such as hotel, transportation, parks, and

worry about anything and just follow their travel guide everywhere. They go see
famous places, take pictures, shop, and stay in the hotels. This travel option
may be boring and redundant for the second and third time travelers who
seek new experiences.</p>

<p></p></div>","Hello, everyone
My name is Amanda Zhang, My
partner is Andrew Wang. We are seeking $6,000 to start up our online travel
service company in Florida which will help Chinese travelers plan their unique trip to the United States. 
I grew up in china, finished my
bachelor's degree in Tourism management and have a firm background of the Chinese travel
market. I'm currently studying my MBA at Barry University, which is located at Miami Shores, FL (will
graduate in 2016). 
My partner, Andrew, grew up in the U.S. has both a Chinese and American travel market background. He studied hotel
management himself in 2013. Now, he is studying his master degree at Barry
University (will graduate in 2015).
We
need your help to start up our online travel service company! 

  The
Company:

SPARK TRAVEL is an online travel service company. The latest
fashion in traveling, where you decide where you want to go and what you want
to do and we’ll take care of all the bookings, reservations, and more! Our main
consumers are travelers from China who don’t want to be stuck in a large tour
group by a travel agency, with a generalized travel plan. Different people want
to have different travel experiences in United States, but aren’t accustomed to
the U.S. environment. We are the right company to offer them a variety of personalized
services they need. 


  Our
Mission:

To help Chinese fashion travelers accomplish their travel dreams in
the U.S. and help them break the language, culture, geographical barriers. To offer
them a variety of online services from everyday travel plans to local
restaurant suggestions or renting of basic transportation. You tell us your
travel ideas, and we’ll make it a reality.

  Background:

The U.S. and China  announced an agreement on November 10 2014
that will lengthen the term of tourist visas from 1 year to 10 years. That
means that as long as Chinese travelers apply for their visas for one time, they can
travel to United States for the next ten years whenever they want. That will
bring a huge convenience for the Chinese travelers meaning that there will be more
Chinese travelers visiting the U.S. for their second or third time. They may want a different travel experience upon their second or third visit. Our company
can meet their needs.

  Our
services:

Our services are internet based, concentrating on Chinese travelers
who want travel to the U.S. by themselves. Initially our services will begin in
Florida, then expand to other states in the U.S.. We will offer all the famous travel locations in Florida and unique
events such as bicycle renting, diving services, fishing services, and even
experiencing local U.S. culture by living with American families. Customers can choose
their desired locations and unique events in the U.S. and our company will help
them make those travel ideas come true. Our services will allow foreign
travelers to gain unique travel experiences not offered by generalized travel
agencies.
Presently, our online travel services is in the introductory stage.
It will become a travel innovation for modern people. It competes primarily
based on our unique travel services and one to one travel planning for Chinese
travelers.  

Our
market:

Our target market will be Chinese travelers. The total amount of
Chinese travelers in the U.S. was approximately 1.8 million in 2013. New
Chinese travelers are travel- savvy, well-educated, and mostly under 45 years of
age. 
This number is expected to grow by 20% per year. As of now, no particular
travel agencies offer this kind of travel experience to consumers so we are
the first. What’s more, due to the new 10 year travel visa, many customers must
be second, third, or even fourth time travelers to the U.S. These customers may desire
different experiences and truly gain the feeling of what it’s like to live with
an American family for several days.

  Competition:

Our main competitions are travel agencies already in existence. They
offer broad travel packages to consumers such as: Florida 10 day travel
package, it includes everything such as hotel, transportation, parks, and
tickets. This may be convenient for some first time consumers since they don’t need to
worry about anything and just follow their travel guide everywhere. They go see
famous places, take pictures, shop, and stay in the hotels. This travel option
may be boring and redundant for the second and third time travelers who
seek new experiences.

  Risk/opportunity:

We differentiate ourselves from those existing travel
agencies which are too stable to gain an interesting travel experience. Some
Chinese travelers want to experience more, they want try more new things, and they
want make their own travel plans. We are the right company which can meet all
their requirements. We realize the huge potential travel market where Chinese
travelers want to plan their own trip and experience more American cultures.
They want their trip to be different from others. We offer all the information
to our consumers first, and let them choose their trip. They can choose where
they want to live, where they want to eat, where they want go, and what they
want do in what place. Everything is dependent on the consumers, then we make
their trip come true. 
Right now, there is no such online travel service company
existing. We are the first one. It can be a risk but also an opportunity for
us.

  Capital
requirement:

We are seeking $6,000 which will enable us to build our
website ($600), set up our services and write contracts with local American house owners ($2500). Set up with local transportation
company and write contacts ($1200). Electricity ($200). Transportation cost ($500). Emergency
spending ($1000).

<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.linkandfound.com/cfunding_tig-tag/platja.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
    Link &amp; Found is an object identification system that speeds up the
    notification, location and recovery of lost items. If you have whatched
    the video you already know how it works!
  </p>
<p>
    Link &amp; Found was officially presented at the <i>IV Fòrum Tecnològic</i>
    organized by <i>Parc Científic i Tecnològic</i> of the University of
    Girona, in Catalonia, Spain. It was a great success, and Link &amp; Found was
    also present in the media:

<h1 style=""margin-top: 2em;"">THE SYSTEM</h1>
<h3>Link &amp; Found Codes</h3>
<p>
    The system is based on the registration of objects identified with a
    unique code in the Link &amp; Found database. The Codes are digitally signed
    to avoid falsification and to certify that they have been generated by
    Link &amp; Found. That is to say, not just any random combination of letters
    and numbers is a valid code.

</div>
<h3>Link &amp; Found Tags</h3>
<p>
    Link &amp; Found tags serve to contain a Link &amp; Found code. For every
    application you are going to produce the most appropriate tags, all
    having in common:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>anonymity of owners is always preserved</li>
<li>they are produced in the most appropriate form for its final
        use</li>
<li>no batteries required, no maintenance</li>
<li>they are made to last in time</li>
<li>easy to identify</li>
<li>they contain additional instructions addressed to the person that
        finds a lost item</li>

<li>the system acceptance</li>
<li>the Tig and Tag plates acceptance</li>
<li>user feedback and response</li>
</ul>
    If the global response is positive and we reach our funding goal, we will
    start to mass produce Tig and Tag plates, and will create new
    distribution and commercialization channels. We will design and produce
    new products based on aluminium or other materials for different
    applications.
  

  <h3 style=""margin-top: 1em;"">Current State</h3>
<p>
    With respect to our business model, we are about to reach investment
    sources. To this end, we need the acceptance of the model and the
    products in the market.
  </p>
<p>
    With respect to technology, we have completed 97% of our first
    developmental stage. We still have to finish:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>mobile application for iPhone (currently almost done!)</li>
<li>some web functionality, planned to be finished before this
        crowdfunding campaign completes</li>
</ul>
    As we said before, mobile app for Android is finished and 100% functional!

<h3>Delivery</h3>
<p>
    We expect to:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>Run the indiegogo campaign for 5 weeks</li>
<li>Production and handling, 4 weeks</li>
<li>Preparation of shipments, 1 week</li>

  <h3>Risks</h3>
<p>
    If this campaign reaches its goal, the main risk we face is a delay in
    the Tigs or Tags manufacturing. This will produce a lag in the shipment
    of your packages.

    But be assured we work with good suppliers. Any issue will be notified

INTRODUCTION



    Link & Found is an object identification system that speeds up the
    notification, location and recovery of lost items. If you have whatched
    the video you already know how it works!
  

    Link & Found was officially presented at the IV Fòrum Tecnològic
    organized by Parc Científic i Tecnològic of the University of
    Girona, in Catalonia, Spain. It was a great success, and Link & Found was
    also present in the media:
  


THE SYSTEM
Link & Found Codes

    The system is based on the registration of objects identified with a
    unique code in the Link & Found database. The Codes are digitally signed
    to avoid falsification and to certify that they have been generated by
    Link & Found. That is to say, not just any random combination of letters
    and numbers is a valid code.
  



Link & Found Tags

    Link & Found tags serve to contain a Link & Found code. For every
    application you are going to produce the most appropriate tags, all
    having in common:
    

anonymity of owners is always preserved
they are produced in the most appropriate form for its final
        use
no batteries required, no maintenance
they are made to last in time
easy to identify
they contain additional instructions addressed to the person that
        finds a lost item




Apps

    You can use the free Link & Found mobile app or the website to set up and
    manage your account. If you have the mobile app you will not only
    recevice notifications in your email, but also on your device.
  

    Android app is fully functional, you can download it right now!
  





 
    


PRODUCT CATALOG

    The very first products we present are the identifying plates Tig
    and Tag, made of anodized aluminium, 1.5mm thick, resistant to
    scratches, solvents, gasoline, oils and other chemical agents. They are
    made to last without maintenance.
  







Tig

      Tig is an identification plate ideal for keychains and
      briefcases. Unobtrusive and stylish. We have already tested the initial
      prototype and we are pleased with the results.
    






Tag

      Tag is the ideal plate for bags and luggage identification, with the
      same features as the Tig plate, but more visible.
    


Other Products
Card



    Card to carry in your wallet. Although your wallet may contain your
    identification and is possible to contact you, Link & Found notifications
    will arrive faster!
  


Note

    For companies and institutions we can customize Tig, Tag
    and cards with your name and logo. An original gift for your employees or
    customers and a way to promote your company.
  
FUNDING

    Your help will be useful for us to validate, evaluate and estimate
    

the potential market
the system acceptance
the Tig and Tag plates acceptance
user feedback and response

    If the global response is positive and we reach our funding goal, we will
    start to mass produce Tig and Tag plates, and will create new
    distribution and commercialization channels. We will design and produce
    new products based on aluminium or other materials for different
    applications.
  

  Current State

    With respect to our business model, we are about to reach investment
    sources. To this end, we need the acceptance of the model and the
    products in the market.
  

    With respect to technology, we have completed 97% of our first
    developmental stage. We still have to finish:
    

mobile application for iPhone (currently almost done!)
some web functionality, planned to be finished before this
        crowdfunding campaign completes

    As we said before, mobile app for Android is finished and 100% functional!

FINANCIACIÓN

    Vuestra ayuda nos servirá para validar, evaluar y estimar
    
el mercado potencial
la aceptación del sistema
la aceptación de las placas Tig y Tag
la respuesta de los usuarios

    Si la respuesta es positiva y la campaña es un éxito, pasaremos a
    producir Tig y Tag a gran escala y a buscar otras vías de distribución y
    comercialización. Diseñaremos y crearemos nuevos productos basados en
    placas de aluminio y otros metales o materiales para distintas
    aplicaciones.
  

  Situación Actual

    Por lo que respecta al modelo de negocio, estamos cerca de atraer a otros
    inversores. Para ello necesitamos la aceptación en el mercado del sistema
    y de los productos.
  

    Por lo que respecta al desarrollo tecnológico, está completado al
    97%. Sólo nos falta terminar:
    
aplicación móbil para iPhone (actualmente está casi completada!)
parte de la funcionalidad en la web (tenemos previsto terminarla
        antes que termine esta campaña de crowdfunding)

    Como ya hemos comentado más arriba, la aplicación para android es 100%
    funcional!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2 class=""p2""><strong>Cycling in the night of the city can be perilous.</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">Vehicles move too close to you, as they cannot judge your width. Signalling your intention to turn is impossible on dark roads, making executing turns near vehicles dangerous. Even after the journey, bicycle lights that are left on the bicycle can be stolen, or damaged from exposure to the elements. </p>
<p class=""p2"">The benefits of cycling are aplenty, and with more people adopting cycling as a form of commuting and leisure, we need to make this healthy activity more safe and convenient. </p>
<p class=""p2"">As industrial design majors from National University of Singapore seeking to provide a solution to these problems, we have created a unique set of bicycle lights that we believe can enhance the experience of night cycling.<br/> </p>
<h2 class=""p2"">
<strong>INTRODUCING</strong><strong style=""font-size: 10px;""> </strong>
</h2>
<p class=""p4""><strong><img alt=""Profile"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s575/uonlights/Profile-text_zps370663cd.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Profile""/></strong></p>
<h2 class=""p4""><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2 class=""p4""><strong>What is it?</strong></h2>
<p class=""p4"">Uon lights are not passive bicycle lights. They also function as signal lights to allow you to signal your intentions to execute a turn while cycling safely. Coupled with Uon bar end plugs, the magnetic bicycle lights can be attached and removed conveniently, while staying strongly adhered to your bicycle while riding. </p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<h2 class=""p2""><strong>Usage<br/></strong></h2>
<p class=""p2""><strong><img alt=""Attaching Uon Lights"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s575/uonlights/attachment_zpsda8d2c21.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Attaching Uon Lights""/></strong></p>
<p>1. Install the Uon bar end plugs onto your bicycle bar ends.</p>
<p>2. Secure the bar end plugs with a hex key.</p>
<p>3. Attach Uon lights to the bar end plugs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""p1""><img alt=""Usage of Uon Lights"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s575/uonlights/using_zps06e173b5.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Usage of Uon Lights""/></p>
<p class=""p1"">4. Activate lights by pressing the power button on the bottom.</p>
<p class=""p1"">5. Activate signal lights by pressing the top button</p>
<p class=""p1"">6. Remove lights from plugs for storage or charging.</p>

<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Expandable bar end plugs<br/></strong></h3>
<p>Uon bar end plugs are designed to fit into most handlebars with inner diameters of <span class=""st"">22mm (<span class=""st"">7/8</span></span><span class=""st"">""). The cap is designed for road &amp; track bicycles, with a diameter of 25mm (a<span class=""st"">pproximately 1''</span>). The plugs can be tightened using a hex key.</span><strong><span class=""st""><br/></span></strong></p>
<p><span class=""st""><img alt=""Uon Lights"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s575/uonlights/Joined_zps2c5b1288.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Uon Lights""/></span></p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Structure</strong></h3>

Vehicles move too close to you, as they cannot judge your width. Signalling your intention to turn is impossible on dark roads, making executing turns near vehicles dangerous. Even after the journey, bicycle lights that are left on the bicycle can be stolen, or damaged from exposure to the elements. 
The benefits of cycling are aplenty, and with more people adopting cycling as a form of commuting and leisure, we need to make this healthy activity more safe and convenient. 
As industrial design majors from National University of Singapore seeking to provide a solution to these problems, we have created a unique set of bicycle lights that we believe can enhance the experience of night cycling. 

INTRODUCING 


 
What is it?
Uon lights are not passive bicycle lights. They also function as signal lights to allow you to signal your intentions to execute a turn while cycling safely. Coupled with Uon bar end plugs, the magnetic bicycle lights can be attached and removed conveniently, while staying strongly adhered to your bicycle while riding. 
 
Usage

1. Install the Uon bar end plugs onto your bicycle bar ends.
2. Secure the bar end plugs with a hex key.
3. Attach Uon lights to the bar end plugs.
 

4. Activate lights by pressing the power button on the bottom.
5. Activate signal lights by pressing the top button
6. Remove lights from plugs for storage or charging.
 
FEATURES

Expandable bar end plugs
Uon bar end plugs are designed to fit into most handlebars with inner diameters of 22mm (7/8""). The cap is designed for road & track bicycles, with a diameter of 25mm (approximately 1''). The plugs can be tightened using a hex key.

Structure
Uon lights are made of anondised die-casted aluminum and the overall body will be weather-sealed to withstand the elements while riding. That means you can work the buttons even in rainy conditions. Strong neodymium magnets will be used to ensure that the light stays on even during the roughest of rides.
Light modes
Uon lights have 3 modes: on, flashing and off state. Each light unit contains frontal white light and a rear red light, both that are triggered simultaneously. These lights are engineered to adhere to road traffic conventions, so any road user can understand them.

Signal lights
When the signal lights are in operation, a yellow blinking light will be triggered for 5 seconds after activation, after which the lights will revert to the previous setting.
Brightness
We are using 4 bright directional one-colour LEDs in our prototype, and we will be using RGB LEDs for our final product to maximize brightness.
Charging
To make charging convenient and reduce the environment impact incurred from using disposable batteries, we intend to use lithium-ion polymer batteries in our lights, that can be charged by using our USB cable.

 
DEVELOPMENTS
Technology
Currently the size of our prototyping materials is large due to the current circuit board and battery unit we are using for testing. Once we have the funds to invest in reducing our component size, we will be improving 
With regards to battery life, we are looking into using rechargeable batteries that can be charged via USB / Micro USB cables, so as to the environmental impact of our product and eliminate the need to purchase new batteries. 
We will be tapping on current technology to create a more sustainable system, such that future Uon add-ons can be used with our current lights in the future without modifications.
Design
After minimizing the internal components as much as we can, we will continue to make improvements to our light design to deliver a sleeker, cooler product to you. We intend to slightly reduce the overall size of our lights so that they are more portable, and look sleeker on your bicycle.
In addition, we will be adding prisms to the lens face so as to diffuse light and make the lights more visible in different directions.

Nonetheless Ion thought through all this time that his potential is not fully used as the orders were of purely technical innovative sort, and the human factor was also very important for him. Disregarding his stable position he wanted more: to realize himself and use his personal ideas and experience: „I always wanted to surprise people, help them and add bright colors to their lives.“ says Ion Cuzmescu.

One time during their travels in Malaisia Cuzmescu’s wife hurt her foot bones, they put on the cast in a wrong way and the bone didn’t grow back well. The foot started to hurt and tire easily from walking. His daughter also had certain issues: because of the flat feet her legs were getting tired very quickly. This was the moment the inventor started thinking about the Thai foot massage that has healing effects on the human body. He turned to the experts in the field and the massages started to take effect.

He then decided to research this topic to the full and mainly to use his experience in electronics and try to help with the flat feet issue.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513497580/p4ylmkv3ulixyb7f6mpk.png"" src=""""/><br/>Ion decided to create smart insoles that would themselves affect the needed points on feet. He left his job and dedicated himself to the new research useful to people. Countless scientific studies proved that there are many active points in human body containing blood vessel ties and these points have higher temperature. They can actively absorb ultraviolet light and have high levels of electric potential. When stimulated, these active points show higher production of useful elements that take part in all crucial processes of the human body. No wonder that reflexotherapy is used in when treating many diseases. Using the reflective massage it’s impossible to harm the human body. Furthermore it’s a fantastic way to diagnose the current state of the body. The swelling and hurting of the certain reflective zones starts long before the body itself develops any pathological signs, which means it’s possible to discover the errors in different exchange processes, and then, using the smart insoles stepG we can help the system start working correctly once again.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513369116/qkls4ey2rsdhp5sddy8p.png"" src=""""/><br/><strong>What will we do with $500?</strong><br/>This is the minimum amount we need when combined with our other sources of financing to develop the product, perform any required modifications, manufacture it and ship it to our backers.</p><p>By helping us get this very valuable funding and voting with your feet, we can put all the pieces of the puzzle together and provide you with your very own stepG system.</p><p><strong>Why you should support us</strong></p><p>We really think that this product will be a disruptive force in the recovery industry.

This is due to the fact that each and every of our nerve endings is connected to a different organ somewhere else in the body. For instance our big toe is responsible for our head and the index and middle toes for our eyes. Foot massage strenghtens the whole organism: it improves blood flow, works as a prevention of arthritis,and removes fatigue, tension and stress.Give yourself pleasure with a foot massage, it will bring you better health and charge you with good mood.  Basic foot reflexology chartEach reflective point on our foot is connected to a certain organ via 300 nerves.Every foot has about 72 000 nerve endings.
Improving blood circulation.
Strenghtening metabolism processes.
Stimulation of food digestion.
Fighting extra weight.
Removing musle fatigue and soreness.
Improving work stamina.
Healing constipations, hemmorhoids and urinary incontinence.
Removing tension, faster healing of injuries, fractures and traumas.
Helping with chronic tiredness, depression, stress and insomnia.
Helping with neurosis, depressive states and apathy.
Helping with diseases of the nervous system: migraines, frequent headaches, neuralgia, neuritis, vegetative-vascular disorders.
Helping with disorders of stomach, intestines, esophagus, disorders in secretion of the gastrointestinal tract.
Helping with pathologies and disorders of the musculoskeletal system: sciatica, osteochondrosis, allergic, rheumatoid arthrosis, arthritis.
Foot massage by smart insoles is especially necessary for seniors to support the alertness and heal a number of diseases.Smart insoles StepG with infrared radiation can work in three modes:MANUALLY ACTIVATED MASSAGE(complete foot massage, activating the blood circulation in all the parts of the foot, according to the time needed for every part of the foot to achieve the maximum effectivity)AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATED MASSAGE(16 nano sensors analyze the blood pressure, puls and muscle tension. The insoles will massage the biologically active points automatically according to the readings of the temperature and micro-vein puls frequency.)MANUALLY ACTIVATED HEATING(In cold seasons thanks to the infrared radiation* the insoles help create a comfortable feeling, choosing and optimal temperature setting )*Infrared radiation is used with the goal of warming up the tissues up to 1,5 cm depth. Infrared rays widen the blood vessels, strenghten micro-circulation of blood, which prevents blood clots and removes slags. The drainage is improved, and the oxygen is better difused in the tissue cells. Metabolism and tissue regeneration is improved as well.Built in accummulator battery lasts up to 3 days according to the intensity of the usage. Built in battery works up to 3 days – depending on the intesity of usage.Inductive wireless charging technology.Simply put the insoles on the chargerSmart insoles withstand high physical loads thanks to kevlar fibers(Kevlar fibers are also used as a protective component, adding the durability to the product in terms of protecting from any abrasive and cutting effects, this material is also often used to create protective gloves and padding for the apparel used in motorsport and snowboarding.)Flexible enough, fit to use in high heel shoesThey are safe to be used, as the electronics are protected by humididty resistant materials. You can wash the StepG in any ordinary washing machine in temperatures up to +140 °F (+60 °C)During the production of StepG we use the technology of micro-porous membranes. Microporos-membranes have hydrophobic and breathing features and create a certain „microclimate“. They are made out of a quantity of small micro pores that have less than 1 μm (Micron) in dieamter. The unique contents of the polyuretan microstructure guarantees that micro-porous membranes remain waterproof even after countless washings and steam sterilization.Test resultsFoot massage using the the smart insoles StepG is a safe technique, during which is impossible to harm the body, unlike when taking medication. Thanks to StepG the biologically active points receive dual massage – magnetic and physiologic.When using the smart insoles our experience shows us that cold hands and feet become warm, the radiculitis pain in the spine is decreased, using the insoles improves the immune durability of the body, restores blood circulation in arteries and the passability of the veins, puffiness is gone, and thanks to improved circulation the blood supply is higher in case of lung diseases. Smart insoles can be used to treat all kinds of illnesses, because the magnetic massage way of healing is effecting the organism in a complex way.Use the StepG for prevention. Primarily, the usage of the insoles is necessary for people, whos professional life is linked to higher levels of exhaustion and the ones with sitting jobs.ConclusionsIt is no secret that massage is very useful, although not everyone can truly relax under hands of the masseur as this pleasure tends not to be cheap.Step G – it’s your personal masseur whom you pay only once.Step G provides the right position of the heel area and the middle part of the foot during walking, it softens impacts on the whole surface of the foot, creates comfortable conditions when walking, takes off the pressure, improves blood circulation, brings the vegetative nervous system into harmony, supports life strenght of the whole body. The insoles, while massaging our feet, stimulate biologically active points, helping to improve the blood circulation. They are flexible and elastic enough to fit any kind of footwear, including high heel shoes.Life expectancy not less then 3 years. The accompanying app effortlessly complements and enhances every feature of StepG. Packed with dynamic features, the app gives users total control over the insole.You can see the full statistics over the whole period you were using the smart insoles stepG. Useful graphs include information from all 16 sensors. You can watch the dynamics of improving your own well-being after the massage, and much more.In February of 2018 the app will be available on the App Store and Google Play MarketIon Cuzmescu spent more than 20 years as an electronic engineer on a secret project, where the bravest innovative ideas were used for the needs of his customer – the government. He had many orders and projects, and Cuzmescu, along with his creative group, always preceeded all the expectations. Nonetheless Ion thought through all this time that his potential is not fully used as the orders were of purely technical innovative sort, and the human factor was also very important for him. Disregarding his stable position he wanted more: to realize himself and use his personal ideas and experience: „I always wanted to surprise people, help them and add bright colors to their lives.“ says Ion Cuzmescu. Even more so, that he had personal predisposition for this.Ion had a wonderful house, a beautiful wife and a daughter. The whole family loved to travel to different countries, get to know the world, people in it, and absorb new knowledge. One time during their travels in Malaisia Cuzmescu’s wife hurt her foot bones, they put on the cast in a wrong way and the bone didn’t grow back well. The foot started to hurt and tire easily from walking. His daughter also had certain issues: because of the flat feet her legs were getting tired very quickly. This was the moment the inventor started thinking about the Thai foot massage that has healing effects on the human body. He turned to the experts in the field and the massages started to take effect. Then Ion remembered the images of the human feet divided into parts, where each segment is responsible for one internal organ. He then decided to research this topic to the full and mainly to use his experience in electronics and try to help with the flat feet issue.Ion decided to create smart insoles that would themselves affect the needed points on feet. He left his job and dedicated himself to the new research useful to people. Countless scientific studies proved that there are many active points in human body containing blood vessel ties and these points have higher temperature. They can actively absorb ultraviolet light and have high levels of electric potential. When stimulated, these active points show higher production of useful elements that take part in all crucial processes of the human body. No wonder that reflexotherapy is used in when treating many diseases. Using the reflective massage it’s impossible to harm the human body. Furthermore it’s a fantastic way to diagnose the current state of the body. The swelling and hurting of the certain reflective zones starts long before the body itself develops any pathological signs, which means it’s possible to discover the errors in different exchange processes, and then, using the smart insoles stepG we can help the system start working correctly once again.What will we do with $500?This is the minimum amount we need when combined with our other sources of financing to develop the product, perform any required modifications, manufacture it and ship it to our backers.By helping us get this very valuable funding and voting with your feet, we can put all the pieces of the puzzle together and provide you with your very own stepG system.Why you should support usWe really think that this product will be a disruptive force in the recovery industry.

<h3>Forged Steel Upper Control Arms</h3>
<p>Guys, you've been looking at lift kits.  Everybody is telling you that in order to run the lift you want to run you'll need aftermarket upper control arms: ""Your caster is going to be whack"".  So, you hit your favorite forums, Facebook groups, and subreddits to find the recommended brands.  You get some info and hit your favorite retailer.  You see the price...  W.H.A.T.?!  </p>
<p>Here's the thing - quality aftermarket upper control arms are expensive.  Really expensive.  They range from $500 to $800 to the end user and in most cases they're required if you're running more than 2"" of lift on a vehicle with independent front suspension.  We're here to tell you it doesn't have to be this way. </p>
<p>We can bring you upper control arms which correct for lift.  We can do this for almost half the cost.  We can do this leveraging American manufacturing and North-American raw materials.   We've been in the automotive aftermarket industry for a decade.  We can do it all.  Well... almost all.  What we can't do?  Tooling costs.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need You</h3>
<p>What we're talking about here is a paradigm shift in aftermarket upper control arm manufacture.  Most of the OEMs are currently manufacturing upper control arms with stamped sheet metal.  Most aftermarket manufacturers are currently manufacturing upper control arms as weldments - DOM tubing bent with bushing and ball joint / uniball cups welded together. </p>
<p>OEM's used to manufacture upper control arms as steel forgings but have gradually moved away from this process as a cost-cutting measure over the last two decades.  There are forging facilities in the USA who will be without contracts as the OEM's continue their transition.  </p>
<p>We're here to kill two birds with one stone: save America and bring you a better, stronger, cheaper aftermarket upper control arm.  We need you.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583851921/bmsryq6to9x9l0zweddy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Forging produces a stronger, more precise, and longer lasting piece than alternatives at a significantly lower cost per unit.  The flip side to this is forging requires extremely high up-front tooling costs to manufacture the dies used in the forging process.  Forging also requires high moq's (minimum order quantities).  </p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We're a 4x4 consumer cooperative in Lincoln, Nebraska and we've been shaking things up since the summer of 2018.  We're member governed and we're here to support a lifestyle of active adventure and exploration.  We've been tapping American manufacturers to bring awesome and affordable products to market, starting with lift coil springs and leaf springs.  We'll soon be bringing affordable shocks and coilovers to market for select applications. </p>
<p>We don't come to this campaign empty-handed.  We've been awarded a NIF Prototype Grant by the Department of Economic Development in the great state of Nebraska to help us make this project a really real reality.  The grant award is in the amount of $27,000.  </p>
<h3>What We're Going To Do</h3>
<p>We're going to start with manufacturing forged upper control arms for the following applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>2005-2020 Toyota Tacoma</li>
<li>2003-2020 Toyota 4Runner</li>
<li>2007-2014 Toyota FJ Cruiser</li>
<li>2003-2009 Lexus GX470</li>
<li>2010-2020 Lexus GX460</li>
<li>2005-2020 Nissan Frontier</li>
<li>2005-2015 Nissan Xterra</li>
</ul>
<p>These arms will be caster-corrected for 3"" of lift (roughly 3 degrees, depending on application).  As this campaign progresses and as funds allow we will add additional applications.  Voting on additional applications will be conducted via polling on our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/alldogsoffroadcoop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alldogs Offroad Coop Facebook page</a>.  This campaign has five tiers and a single add-on perk.  </p>

<li>An Awesome Sticker, T-shirt, Assembled Forged Upper Control Arms, and an ADO Membership</li>
</ol>
<p>Our upper control arms will be manufactured to use readily-available OE-style bushings and ball joints.  They will also be treated for corrosion resistance.  Bare arms can be purchased by DIY-types who will need to source and assemble bushings and ball joints.  Assembled arms will be furnished with high quality bushings and ball joints assembled with loving care in Lincoln, Nebraska by yours truly.  </p>
<p>Our timeline is to run this campaign for 50 days.  If the campaign is successfully funded we will move to production.  Our forge has a 6 week lead time.  If all goes as planned we will have product on customers' doorsteps before the end of July 2020.  If the campaign is not successfully funded, funding will be returned to the customer.  </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;color:rgb(0, 111, 50);'>The Problems We Address</span></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Classic cars are deteriorating due to lack of investment and use</strong></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543138660/tbadfspwwefk6maahowe.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p><strong>Problems for classic car owners: </strong>Most classic cars are used as second vehicles and spend most of the time not being used (which is bad for any car). The Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs reports that 27% of historic cars are not driven at all, with a further 30% used fewer than ten times a year! It's not surprising that many owners end up selling their classic because they cannot justify the cost of ownership.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/7OVSnX2W24sgXe1q7L/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p>
<p><strong>Problems for non-owners</strong>: Your options to drive a classic are extremely limited; you basically have to buy one (and maintain, and store it). And what if you like lots of classics? You can't buy them all. Many classic car enthusiasts are put off by the need to store and maintain a car they'll hardly use.</p>
<p><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/ZOiO6U5F2amEpEeURH/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p>
<hr/>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;color:rgb(0, 111, 50);"">How We Solve These Problems</h3>
<p>OldenCars bridges this gap and offers a revolutionary way to enjoy classic cars. We provide owners a secure way to earn money from their car and meet fellow enthusiasts. We help owners keep their cars on the road, not stuck in the garage. We provide the platform, marketing, bespoke person to person car sharing insurance, payment gateway, and support between owner and driver.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540749070/pigveh8nyccysfja1xly.png"" src=""""/></p>
<div><p><strong>For car owners: </strong>Our platform enables classics owners to earn money from their car by sharing it with fellow enthusiasts in a safe and secure way when they're not using it. This helps to offset the cost of ownership. </p></div>
<p><strong>For car renters: </strong>We provide convenient and secure access to a wide choice of everyday classics without long-term commitment, maintenance overheads, and storage requirements. Whether renters need a car for a special occasion, or just to try one out, we connect them with owners who want to share their passion.</p>
<div><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">OldenCars creates</span><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> a community of enthusiasts, including all those people who've never had the opportunity to try out classic </span>motoring<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> first-hand. </span></font></p></div>
<hr/>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;color:rgb(0, 111, 50);"">Trust and Security</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540324888/ies5l4a779vs6kx3xvoy.jpg"" src=""""/><p>We understand it is critical for us to<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> build trust and offer a secure solution. </span></p>
<p>Some classics owners may not feel comfortable letting other people drive their car. To address this we:</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>Focus on 'everyday' practical classics with a value less than £40,000.</li>
<li>Arrange insurance that covers owners and renters for the period of the rental (so each owner's insurance policy is unaffected). </li>
<li>Undertake stringent checks on renters (including information from DVLA) and operate a 'member rates member' review process.</li>
<li>Give owners complete control as to when their car is available, how much they charge and who they rent it to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our booking process will be straight-forward and pricing transparent so renters can easily make their choice from all the appropriately located cars.</p>
<p>Renters may feel nervous about their ability to drive a classic car. We encourage the owners to provide detailed information about their car, including any of its individual characteristics. Renters meet the owners in person when they collect the keys - this is another opportunity to learn about the car.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;color:rgb(0, 111, 50);"">Response and Feedback</h3>
<p>We have received an encouragingly positive response to date, with key themes being: </p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of time on the road is a well-acknowledged (and expensive) problem for classics. Having a way to do this securely to pre-vetted drivers with a member review system was welcomed as a solution to this problem.</li>

<p>The UK has thriving classics market with significant interest in, and demand for, classics.</p>
<p>In the UK alone there are an estimated 500,000 owners and a further 1.5 million 'highly interested' enthusiasts who spend time and money in the world of historic vehicles (figures courtesy of The Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs). Today there are over one million UK historic vehicles (30 years and older) registered with the DVLA.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Of these, only 10% are in concours condition and clearly treasured. We do not expect these owners to post to our site, but </span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>their likely exclusion will not prevent OldenCars from succeeding in its mission.</span></p>
<p>The vast majority of registered historic cars are in a condition suitable for person to person car hire, with 56% being 'very good all round, but not perfect'. This is unsurprising: it is well-known that classics owners often live with niggles, putting off the expense of getting such issues rectified. OldenCars offers them a way to derive earnings to offset this expense (and for the owners to enjoy the car more too).</p>
<p>These numbers do not include the more modern classics (20 - 30 years old), increasing our opportunity to build a large, active community of enthusiasts.</p>
</div></div>","The Problems We Address
Classic cars are deteriorating due to lack of investment and use

Problems for classic car owners: Most classic cars are used as second vehicles and spend most of the time not being used (which is bad for any car). The Federation of British Historic Vehicle Clubs reports that 27% of historic cars are not driven at all, with a further 30% used fewer than ten times a year! It's not surprising that many owners end up selling their classic because they cannot justify the cost of ownership.

Problems for non-owners: Your options to drive a classic are extremely limited; you basically have to buy one (and maintain, and store it). And what if you like lots of classics? You can't buy them all. Many classic car enthusiasts are put off by the need to store and maintain a car they'll hardly use.


How We Solve These Problems
OldenCars bridges this gap and offers a revolutionary way to enjoy classic cars. We provide owners a secure way to earn money from their car and meet fellow enthusiasts. We help owners keep their cars on the road, not stuck in the garage. We provide the platform, marketing, bespoke person to person car sharing insurance, payment gateway, and support between owner and driver.

For car owners: Our platform enables classics owners to earn money from their car by sharing it with fellow enthusiasts in a safe and secure way when they're not using it. This helps to offset the cost of ownership. 
For car renters: We provide convenient and secure access to a wide choice of everyday classics without long-term commitment, maintenance overheads, and storage requirements. Whether renters need a car for a special occasion, or just to try one out, we connect them with owners who want to share their passion.
OldenCars creates a community of enthusiasts, including all those people who've never had the opportunity to try out classic motoring first-hand. 

Trust and Security
We understand it is critical for us to build trust and offer a secure solution. 
Some classics owners may not feel comfortable letting other people drive their car. To address this we:

Focus on 'everyday' practical classics with a value less than £40,000.
Arrange insurance that covers owners and renters for the period of the rental (so each owner's insurance policy is unaffected). 
Undertake stringent checks on renters (including information from DVLA) and operate a 'member rates member' review process.
Give owners complete control as to when their car is available, how much they charge and who they rent it to.

Our booking process will be straight-forward and pricing transparent so renters can easily make their choice from all the appropriately located cars.
Renters may feel nervous about their ability to drive a classic car. We encourage the owners to provide detailed information about their car, including any of its individual characteristics. Renters meet the owners in person when they collect the keys - this is another opportunity to learn about the car.

Response and Feedback
We have received an encouragingly positive response to date, with key themes being: 

Lack of time on the road is a well-acknowledged (and expensive) problem for classics. Having a way to do this securely to pre-vetted drivers with a member review system was welcomed as a solution to this problem.
Our decision to focus on modern, practical classics was validated in talking to hundreds of classics owners. Older cars are deemed too delicate and awkward for trouble-free hires.
Enthusiasts who don't yet own a classic told us they see our platform as a gentle way to get more actively involved in classics without having to dive in at the deep end and buy a car.
Owners who are very protective about their car will not post them (not a surprise), but we met  many other owners who would like to earn towards the upkeep of their car.



The Plan

Should our campaign reach its goals and demonstrate we have sufficient interest we'll start first thing in the New Year building our platform and implementing the marketing plan.

Complete our prototype by adding the payment gateway and review system
Run extensive tests on the rental platform and payment systems
Post advertisements and articles in the classic motoring press
Work with classic owners to get their cars registered and accounts setup
Deliver perks to our supporters
Go live!

I currently sell my portraits and since visiting Paris Foto last year, I made the decision that my next big project would be to make a book. </p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I made a very last minute decision to travel from Australia to France. The short version of the story is that I received an email on a Friday saying that I had won a First, Second and Third Prize in a Parisian Photographic Competition. I was invited to attend the exhibition opening which would be in Paris and then to travel to Arles for the best Photography Festival in France where more of the work would be shown. So that Monday I made the decision to leave for France, alone. My ticket was booked only a few hours before my departure and I left with $2 in my bank account. I had to borrow money so that my bank account wasn't empty when I arrived in France - otherwise I may not even get into the country! (I have since been payed!!)</p>
<p>Being at the Arles photography festival has been an amazing experience. I have met some amazing industry people and have been given some amazing opportunities - including the offer of a projection of my works. Discussions with the people that I have met and just being here has cemented in my mind the fact that I want to make a book. </p>
<p>I want to share the amazing places that I have seen, introduce the beautiful people I have met and share the funny stories that I have encountered along the way. The book would be a combination of photographs and words. Portraits of people, photographs of the stunning scenery and a description of each photograph included in the book. </p>
<p>Now that I am here, I want to continue to travel for as long as I can so that I can keep adding to the book. I hope that this will be the first of many travel journals. I hope that it will make a beautiful coffee table book and be a different take on travel books. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Any funding will be incredibly helpful in making this dream happen. Already being in Europe, I feel its better to stay for as long as I can and continue to add to my body of work, so that, in the end I can put together a fantastic presentation. </p>
<p>Currently I am staying in budget accommodation and have been making salads and eating fruit. I don't want to waste money on eating out! I will continue to do this for the rest of the trip. I have also been lucky in that I have had offers from friends, new and old for free accommodation which is great. It means I can stay a little longer and will have some local knowledge! </p>
<p>My plan is to head from Arles to Spain, Spain to Morocco, Morocco back through France, France to Italy, Italy to Belgium, Belgium to Germany. Maybe not in that order but those are the places that I would like to go. </p>
<p>When I first began taking photos, my intention was to take photos that could be used to help people. Whether this be through sharing a story or raising awareness of a particular issue. This would also be a goal of creating this book. I will seek out minorities that need help exposing an issue, get to know locals in smaller communities and help them in any way I can. </p>
<p>Funding will be used to help with travel costs and the costs involved in putting my book together and getting it out there. I will be putting the book together with or without the help of funding so any funds raised will be going towards this cause, nothing will be wasted. Contributors perks will include photographic prints and copies of the book. </p>
<p>Back in Australia, I own a fine art Photographic Printer and would use this to print the images myself, thus ensuring they are of the best possible quality. All photographs would be printed on Archival Photographic Cotton, ensuring the colours are most vibrant and the prints most impressive. The book will be a collection of A4 prints that can be framed and hung on the wall if this is your intention.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will make it a whole lot easier and quicker for the project to come together. The project is something I intend to carry out with funding or without but any contributions will help immensely. </p>
<p><b>My Track Record</b></p>
<p>I am currently represented by and Art Gallery in Brighton Australia for the sale of my portraits. I have also been selected for numerous exhibitions throughout Australia, Paris, Arles, Aspen and New York.</p>
<p>I have also been lucky enough to receive a number of Photography Awards both nationally and internationally. These include:</p>

<p>The other challenge is getting people to let you into their world. So far, I have found everyone incredibly warm and welcoming. I think that being in a place long enough that people start to become familiar with you also helps. On the plus side, this is the way I like to travel. I am not that interested in running around like a crazy person trying to see all the monuments and famous places in one day. In fact, I'm not even all that interested in that side of things. Yes it is great to see, but I am much more interested in getting to know the locals, making friends with them and living like them. I think by travelling in this way, I will have no trouble finding interesting content for my book. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>This Comfortable</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>With the busy pace of everyday life, it has become nearly impossible to enjoy the present moment. For us, camping is the best way to disconnect from the daily madness and connect with the simpler things in life. As much as we love the outdoors, our camping experience always seems to be deprived of one thing: comfort. Even though we have driven hours away from home to sleep in nature, we find ourselves secretly wishing we were sleeping in our own bed. </p>

This Comfortable
 
With the busy pace of everyday life, it has become nearly impossible to enjoy the present moment. For us, camping is the best way to disconnect from the daily madness and connect with the simpler things in life. As much as we love the outdoors, our camping experience always seems to be deprived of one thing: comfort. Even though we have driven hours away from home to sleep in nature, we find ourselves secretly wishing we were sleeping in our own bed. 
 

 
Given our fanatical obsession with technical gear and our vast experience in the mattress and bedding industry, we sought out to solve the problem of sleeping comfortably outdoors.

</div><p><b>Seek N</b><b>’ </b><b>Sneak</b> is an Arduino powered self-controlled robot which is able to run around, find objects, grab them, relocate them and do many other useful and funny things.</p><h3>- <b>Motivation.</b>
</h3><p>Why did we develop this robot? There is a very short answer: kids! </p><p>They need 10 to 30 minutes (depending on their temper) to scatter literally all the toys they have over their rooms, so initially we were looking for some way to automate a tedious process of daily toys collection. We solved this problem, but we realized that there are many other cool applications for this robot. We found that our robot can be smart, fast, strong, fearless and funny, just like a badger, and we named it <b>Seek N’ Sneak</b>.</p><p> 

</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/gh2T_w8otec?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">- </span><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Seek N’ Sneak robot at a glance.</b><br/></p><p>The two driving wheels of this robot are powered by independently controlled motors and equipped with 128-steps-per-revolution encoders allowing for precise control of the angular position of the wheel, as well as its velocity and acceleration. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/XEY1RXZ6FGU?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<p></p><p>An independent 2D orientation of the rover is provided by two side mounted IR proximity meters. Objects are detected by the third centered IR proximity meter. The three IR sensors can be replaced by one PING)))™ Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/6MuAQy3KAyk?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<p></p><p>The arm is run by 3 super-strong servo-motors, so it is fast and powerful enough to push up about 3 pounds, or even lift the robot itself, or throw objects.</p><p>
</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/sh7i1j7Uxlg?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<p></p><p><b>Seek N’ Sneak</b> is an Arduino Mega 2560 powered robot. The robot software is completely open sourced, so you can either use the original software which has already been developed for you, or you can modify it as you please to meet your demands. You can then use commands like LOOK FOR AN OBJECT, GRAB or THROW instead of writing low-level code to control the sensors, motors and servos directly or develop your own way of thinking for the robot from scratch using the Arduino integrated development environment.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/870718/files/20140920134833-OpenSource.png?1411246113"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Though <b>Seek N’ Sneak </b>was designed as a fully autonomous, upgradable robot. There is plenty of space inside the body of the robot to extend Arduino board with extra sensors or with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth shields to establish communication with a computer or remote control.</p><p><b>Seek N’ Sneak</b>’s body and arm parts, depending on the kit you choose, are made of either 5mm laser cut black acrylic glass, 3mm laser cut galvanized aluminum or 2mm milled carbon-fiber composite. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/867811/files/20140919002429-All.jpg?1411111469"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>8.4 - 9.6V accumulator (not included*) is used as the only power supply.</p><h3>- <b>What can Seek N’ Sneak robot do?</b>

</h3><ul>
<li>it can't fly... yet,</li>
<li>it has no any ""+18"" application, at least we did not try,</li>
<li>we did not integrate the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Three Laws of Robotics</a> in the robot's brain yet, so be careful :). </li>
</ul><h3>- <b>Can you use it?</b>
</h3><p>Yes, if you have a very basic knowledge in electronics and programming OR if you are able to accurately follow simple instructions. <b>Seek N’ Sneak</b> robot is provided as a kit, so you will need some basic tools including wrenches, screwdrivers, diagonal cutter and soldering set. For young technicians supervision is recommended.</p><p>The <b>Seek N’ Sneak</b> robot can also be a great gift to get your child interested in robotics. Since the databank of free softw­­­­are will be continuously replenished, people with no programming background can also enjoy the fun of robotics.</p><p>No matter if you are an experienced programmer, a robotics fan, or a school teacher trying to interest kids in robotics, the <b>Seek N’ Sneak</b> is a great way to learn about mechanics, electronics and programming… All in one!</p><h3>- <b>What does SN’S kit include?</b>

The next task mainly focuses on finding suppliers and packing service.</p><br/><p></p></div>","Seek N’ Sneak is an Arduino powered self-controlled robot which is able to run around, find objects, grab them, relocate them and do many other useful and funny things.- Motivation.
Why did we develop this robot? There is a very short answer: kids! They need 10 to 30 minutes (depending on their temper) to scatter literally all the toys they have over their rooms, so initially we were looking for some way to automate a tedious process of daily toys collection. We solved this problem, but we realized that there are many other cool applications for this robot. We found that our robot can be smart, fast, strong, fearless and funny, just like a badger, and we named it Seek N’ Sneak. 

- Seek N’ Sneak robot at a glance.The two driving wheels of this robot are powered by independently controlled motors and equipped with 128-steps-per-revolution encoders allowing for precise control of the angular position of the wheel, as well as its velocity and acceleration. 
An independent 2D orientation of the rover is provided by two side mounted IR proximity meters. Objects are detected by the third centered IR proximity meter. The three IR sensors can be replaced by one PING)))™ Ultrasonic Distance Sensor.
The arm is run by 3 super-strong servo-motors, so it is fast and powerful enough to push up about 3 pounds, or even lift the robot itself, or throw objects.

Seek N’ Sneak is an Arduino Mega 2560 powered robot. The robot software is completely open sourced, so you can either use the original software which has already been developed for you, or you can modify it as you please to meet your demands. You can then use commands like LOOK FOR AN OBJECT, GRAB or THROW instead of writing low-level code to control the sensors, motors and servos directly or develop your own way of thinking for the robot from scratch using the Arduino integrated development environment.Though Seek N’ Sneak was designed as a fully autonomous, upgradable robot. There is plenty of space inside the body of the robot to extend Arduino board with extra sensors or with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth shields to establish communication with a computer or remote control.Seek N’ Sneak’s body and arm parts, depending on the kit you choose, are made of either 5mm laser cut black acrylic glass, 3mm laser cut galvanized aluminum or 2mm milled carbon-fiber composite. 8.4 - 9.6V accumulator (not included*) is used as the only power supply.- What can Seek N’ Sneak robot do?
The most impressive thing is that the robot runs as a fully independent  unit:

it can find and collect objects on the ground,


chase and attack other robots


you can make it organize your living space, placing things back in place whenever they are found where they should not be.

You are only limited by your imagination.- What Seek N’ Sneak robot can not do:

it can't fly... yet,
it has no any ""+18"" application, at least we did not try,
we did not integrate the Three Laws of Robotics in the robot's brain yet, so be careful :). 
- Can you use it?
Yes, if you have a very basic knowledge in electronics and programming OR if you are able to accurately follow simple instructions. Seek N’ Sneak robot is provided as a kit, so you will need some basic tools including wrenches, screwdrivers, diagonal cutter and soldering set. For young technicians supervision is recommended.The Seek N’ Sneak robot can also be a great gift to get your child interested in robotics. Since the databank of free softw­­­­are will be continuously replenished, people with no programming background can also enjoy the fun of robotics.No matter if you are an experienced programmer, a robotics fan, or a school teacher trying to interest kids in robotics, the Seek N’ Sneak is a great way to learn about mechanics, electronics and programming… All in one!- What does SN’S kit include?
The standard Seek N’ Sneak kit contains everything* you need to complete the assembly of the robot including 

laser cut body parts along with 


DC motors with encoders, 


dual motor shieldand wheels, 


arm powering servos, 


IR proximity meters, 


an Arduino Mega 2560** or analog control board, 


screws, nuts and spacers, flanged bearing wheels, wires, connectors, breadboard and other minor parts.

You will be provided with a full step-by-step tutorial explaining how to assemble your Seek N’ Sneak robot. Moreover, you will get the intermediate programming sketches that will help you to properly connect and test all the electronic parts one by one.

* Accumulator is not included; see recommended type of accumulator here (9.6V) or here (8.4V).** You can replace it with Arduino UNO as it has exactly as many pins as needed. However we strongly recommend Mega 2560 board because it gives you a lot of room for experiments with additional drives, sensors, screens, pushbuttons or LEDs.- Seek N’ Sneak evolution.

</div>
</div></div>","The biggest reason to back the HUB is …
Because it will give you the POWER to escape the rat race.
Designed in Australia and solidly constructed to withstand
the elements, the HUB Chair's unique design incorporates the powerful ability to charge
your electronic gadgets when you just want to get away from it all in the great outdoors.Easily the smartest camping chair ever made, the HUB is
genius!
Having one of these chairs can totally save your day:


When you’re watching the kids play football and your camera
battery fails!


When you’re at the beach finishing your murder mystery eBook
and your tablet dies!


When you’re camping out for the weekend and have forgotten
to charge the camp lantern!


There are in fact plenty of other reasons to back the HUB, like
weatherproof Bluetooth speakers, an LED flashlight, a portable solar panel or
an easy access cooler… But being able to escape and get away from it all and still have the convenience of having POWER on hand, is the one
you will love the most.Here's what people have said about the HUB
 Christine King. Brisbane, Australia.
""(It's) what I’ve been saying ie. These days everyone in
your group will have things they’ll still want to take with them that require
charging. And also, just think about the amount of stuff you pack to take with
you to “get a way from it all” and end up bringing it with you anyway. The HUB
simplifies that!""





The Hub packs power

Never again worry about having forgotten to pre-charge your electronic gadgets before making your escape from the Big Smoke!

Built in to the HUB table top is a massive 10,000Mah power bank that could run the bluetooth speakers alone for up to 7hrs non-stop or fully charge your iPhone 5 times over. The polymer battery pack is lightweight, water and dust resistant and puts out a 'fast charge' through two x 2.5amp USB ports that will happily charge a couple of your electronic gadgets simultaneously! 
Here's a list of gadgets you might want to charge up:


Camera  Fitness Band  GoPro  Drone  Mobile Phone  GPS        Video Sunglasses  eBook Tablet, iPad  Camping Lantern

Recharging your HUB power bank is also easy. 


Standard with every chair, comes an extra long 3m micro/USB cord and Car Charger that plugs into your car's 12V cigarette socket. Monitor how charged you are with the LED indicator lights and juice up if you need to while you're driving or when you get there. 


Portable Solar Panel

Even if your vehicle's 12V socket is miles away, you can always whip out your trusty fast-charging 18W Solar Panel wallet (conveniently stowed in the armrest pannier where you won't forget it) and charge your HUB power bank using the sun's free rays! This lightweight, waterproof, highly efficient mini panel is dead easy to use; just position it in the full sun and plug it into the micro USB port (with the cord supplied) on the side of the table.  
Make yourself truly self-sufficient when you next head off the beaten track.




Built-in Bluetooth Speakers




Really set the mood and groove to your favourite tunes!



Fully waterproof in the event of an unexpected shower, the superior quality speakers and subwoofer produce sounds with a smooth baseline quality, clear mids and plenty of volume to fill your outdoor spaces. Let your music play for hours using the built-in power bank and take or make phone calls directly from the table top (if you really want to that is!)



 Party Connect Technology

Two HUBs are better than one! Create a surround sound party atmosphere when you're in the middle of nowhere with this leading edge technology that connects the speakers from two HUB chairs to a single music source. That means you can play your party tunes with double the volume and outdoor reach; surely the best reason to own two HUBs!


Stable Pivoting Table
What really sucks about eating outdoors is when you've just managed to carefully balance the plate of food on your lap and it decides to take a nosedive into the sand! And don't you just KNOW how impossible it is to properly wash sand from a juicy steak?

For this feature alone, it's worth having a HUB Chair with your own stable personal table that swings to the front for eating and to the side for sharing a bowl of nuts with your drinking buddy. Position the sticky silicon grip-mat on the table surface and pivot it at an angle to create a non-slip easel for sketching or hands free e-reading.





Detachable LED Flashlight

They say we ""eat with our eyes"" and nothing makes camp food more enjoyable than being able to see what's on the plate in front of us... but when the sun's gone down and there's only starlight to see by, it ain't so easy!
The HUB's 80 Lumens LED torch will likely make your food taste better by giving you hands-free tabletop illumination with it's magnetic attachment and unique bendable shaft for directing the light where you most need it. The flashlight easily detaches for BBQ checking duty or for finding your tent in the dark!
Tough Chair Construction

The last 
thing you need in the great outdoors is a cheap, flimsy excuse for a camping 
chair with fabric you can shoot peas through and a frame that can't cope with a 
bit of rough treatment.

Be confident in knowing that we consider a strong, well-balanced, sturdy and durable structure to be an essential foundation element of the HUB chair; one that will never be compromised. We have used lightweight curved and moulded aluminium tubing with a tough, anodised, powder coat finish in an easy-to-fold-up oversized director's chair style. Hard plastic elbows on the leg corners stop your chair from sinking in the sand and tipping you out, whilst the heavy UV-protected polyester canvas seat and back is padded in just the right spots for maximum laid-back comfort.



Armrest Cooler Bag

Don't get up, stay right there in your seat... reach lazily to your left, flip up the quick-access lid and pull out another icy cold one. RELAX!

It is so EASY to stay refreshed in the HUB! Fit up to 12 cold cans or other snacks and beverages in the detachable soft-sided cooler for possible all-day personal supply. The comfy adjustable shoulder strap makes for an easy BYO to your neighbour's beach party or convenient refill from the mother icebox.


Detachable Trolley Wheels

How much other stuff have you got to cart to your favourite picnic spot?Turn your HUB into a very handy packhorse:  attach the wide-tread off-road wheels, load up the seat with up to 30kgs of gear, tip and pull/push your HUB cart with the sturdy webbing handles off into the wild!  When you get there, simply detach the wheels, sit down, put your feet up and ENJOY!

<br/><h3>About LifeDisc</h3>
<p>LifeDisc started with the goal of having a compact fishing kit on hand whenever you need it, but has evolved into much more.<br/> <br/>Measuring just 37mm in height and 200mm in diameter, LifeDisc builds into a personal life sustaining toolkit that can be neatly stowed in your backpack, glove box or bug-out bag so it's always within easy reach. 
</p>
<p>LifeDisc features a tough signalling mirror that's built to withstand the outdoors and usable without needing to open the disc. If you find yourself in need of rescue, being able to draw the attention of rescuers quickly is key to survival.<br/> <br/>A simple twist reveals a watertight storage unit with 240 cubic centimetre capacity. The contents of the storage unit have very deliberately been left to your own personal choice. Whilst we would expect that most survival kits would include an emergency water filter, fire starter, compass, etc., opinions vary widely when selecting personal survival items. So whether your preference is for GPS locators or insulin, the best thing that we feel we can offer with LifeDisc is freedom of choice.<br/> <br/>That said, we plan to offer you the option of purchasing the following ready-made kit of the basics we feel you would need in a survivalist situation. And yes, all of these items fit  within the LifeDisc storage unit : <br/><a href=""http://www.aquamira.com/preparedness/aquamira-frontier-filter"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Ready For Production</h3>
<p>We have been quietly perfecting the LifeDisc design for over a year now and have created working prototypes to ensure the final design works flawlessly (see photos). Now that the design is safely covered by patent, it's time to release it to the world.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>To take LifeDisc into full production, we need to raise $48,000 to cover the injection mould tooling. Our funding goal has been calculated to cover this initial up-front tooling cost, plus the cost of producing the LifeDiscs that you, our backer (read savior) will be receiving as part of your perk.<br/><br/>We have chosen a fixed funding model for our Indiegogo campaign. This means that all of your contributions are refunded by Indiegogo if this campaign doesn't raise at least enough to fund the production of the LifeDiscs promised to you in your perks. </p>There are two Early Bird perks for backers 
that are quick off the mark. We're offering 1000 LifeDiscs at $10 off, 
and another 1000 at $5 off the expected retail price as an extra

<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The most time consuming process in getting production up and running is the creation of the injection mould tooling which will take around 12 weeks to complete 5 moulds. We will be using that time to ensure that the other components (Paracord, fishing line, etc.) are ready for assembly when production starts in February, 2014. Below is our expected timeline and we will ensure that every backer is kept up to date by email as things progress :</p>
<ul>
<li>Nov, 2013 - Commence Injection Mould Tooling</li>
<li>Feb, 2014 - Start Production and Assembly</li>
<li>Mar, 2014 - Begin Shipping LifeDiscs to Indiegogo Backers<br/>

LifeDisc started with the goal of having a compact fishing kit on hand whenever you need it, but has evolved into much more. Measuring just 37mm in height and 200mm in diameter, LifeDisc builds into a personal life sustaining toolkit that can be neatly stowed in your backpack, glove box or bug-out bag so it's always within easy reach. 

LifeDisc features a tough signalling mirror that's built to withstand the outdoors and usable without needing to open the disc. If you find yourself in need of rescue, being able to draw the attention of rescuers quickly is key to survival. A simple twist reveals a watertight storage unit with 240 cubic centimetre capacity. The contents of the storage unit have very deliberately been left to your own personal choice. Whilst we would expect that most survival kits would include an emergency water filter, fire starter, compass, etc., opinions vary widely when selecting personal survival items. So whether your preference is for GPS locators or insulin, the best thing that we feel we can offer with LifeDisc is freedom of choice. That said, we plan to offer you the option of purchasing the following ready-made kit of the basics we feel you would need in a survivalist situation. And yes, all of these items fit  within the LifeDisc storage unit : 
** The Following Optional Items Are Not Included In The Indiegogo Perks **

Aquamira Frontier Emergency Water Filter System 

Virogard Personal Protective Mask


SOL Fire Lite With Tinder Quik

Multi-Tool (Can Opener, etc.)

Fox 40 Micro Safety Whistle 

CRKT RSK Mk5 Knife 
20mm AA Grade Compass
Needle and Thread

Alcohol Swabs

Survival Snare

Wire SawThe retail value of this ready-made kit is $90, however we hope to have enough customer interest to qualify for volume discounts (see how you can help below).





The signalling mirror and storage unit can be detached, which then allows the outer covers to be removed. Inside you'll find a rope spool wound with 12 metres of 550 Paracord which can also be removed and used separately. The central reel, wound with 100 metres of Platypus 30lb fishing line, is enclosed behind the rope spool ensuring that it remains tangle free and ready for use. The two outer covers turn over and bayonet back onto the central reel forming a full size hand reel ready to catch your next meal.LifeDisc is manufactured in Australia from an ultra-tough plastic alloy that is chemical and UV resistant, making it virtually indestructible. LifeDisc also includes a drawstring net carry bag which doubles as a holding net for your catch. ""Safety Orange"" is the default LifeDisc color, but you also have the option of White, Black or Military Green if you would prefer.


So whether you're looking for a compact fishing kit for your next outdoor adventure, or a personal life sustaining tool for emergency preparedness, LifeDisc is up to the task.

Co-founder, KS Jin, currently stays in Korea to ensure the continued development and quality manufacturing. As MyCanoe grows, our plan is to manufacture in the United States. We've already identified a few partners that could take on the job here in Knoxville, TN. </p><p>Q. What is made of and how long will the MYCANOE last ?</p><p>A. MYCANOE is made of a 5 mm double-layer custom polypropylene that is lightweight and extraordinarily strong. It is manufacturer rated for 20,000 fold cycles. We've tested in a various water/weather conditions and haven't yet found any issues. With proper care, a MYCANOE can last for years of paddling. Every component piece can be replaced in the event of breakage.</p><p>Q. How do I care for MYCANOE?</p><p>A. We recommend treating your MYCANOE as you would a fiberglass, wood, or skin-on-frame canoe: don’t drag it or bump into sharp things, store out of direct sunlight, and rinse the canoe thoroughly with fresh water after each use.</p><p>Q. How stable is a MYCANOE?</p><p>A. The MYCANOE is quite stable and difficult to capsize. However, we recommend that inexperienced paddlers go with a companion, and don't attempt to use the MYCANOE in conditions beyond their skill level.</p><p>Q. Does the MYCANOE float?</p><p>A. Yes, the MYCANOE is buoyant and will float even if it capsizes. However, we recommend taking every safety precaution, including personal flotation devices and equipping bow and stern with floating bags.</p><p>Q. Will repeated folding weaken the hull?</p><p>A. The body of MYCANOE is manufacturer rated for 20,000 fold cycles - that's a lot of folds!</p><p>Q. Can I take MYCANOE on a plane?</p><p>A. Yes, MYCANOE can be checked as luggage, and the best way to protect MYCANOE during transport is to cover with a protective material (e.g. blanket).</p><p>Q. Can It Be Used For Fishing?</p><p>A. Yes. With minor modifications the MyCanoe can be outfitted with a rod holder. Another great choice for outfitting your MyCanoe is with one of RAM's mounts— RAM Mounts makes a Tough Claw, that works perfectly on the MyCanoe. Clamps down tight without drilling any holes, and you can then attach a rod holder, or cup holder,camera mount, fish finder, etc. The RAM Mount can then be paired with a YakAttack or RAM rod holder. We recommend a stabilizer kit for added stability when fishing.</p><p>Q. Can I attach a trolling motor to the MyCanoe?</p><p>A. Yes. We recommend a small lightweight motor to properly protect the hull and gunwales from damage. For MyCanoe, you will need either a DIY mount (e.g., see YouTube) or buy one from online - search for ""Canoe trolling motor mount"".</p><p>Q. Can I take the MyCanoe in salt water?</p><p>A. Salt water will not damage the MyCanoe. Just make sure to rinse the inside and outside of the hull, all joints, parts and accessories after each use. Dry before folding.</p><p>Q. What if I hit a rock?</p><p>A. Avoid rocks.

The case itself becomes the canoe’s floor, adding structural support and ensuring they won’t get lost throughout the day.""  - Digital Trends -MyCanoe is made to go with you on all your adventures. MyCanoe is a lightweight, patented origami folding canoe. It is a high quality folding canoe that turns into a beautiful Canadian canoe in 10 minutes. Its full sized 14.5 ft with two seats are perfect for sharing with family and friends for a quick trip to water. When it is folded to a case, it fits in most small sedans.  
MyCanoe unfolds into a quality 14 ft canoe in only 10 minutes, and takes only 5 minutes to fold back up.
At only 52 lbs, MyCanoe is easy to take with you wherever you go!
The optional paddles are two-piece for easy carrying. If you ever drop one in the water, they float!
The two-piece carrying covers are used as the floor of the canoe so you don't leave anything behind.

The body of MyCanoe is made from a marine-grade custom polypropylene with a 15 year UV treatment that will withstand 20,000 folds!
On the off-chance that your MyCanoe capsizes, there is no need to worry as your canoe will still floats.
The main body comes with 15-year warranty and 1 year for the other parts. Even after 1 year, if a part deemed a defect rather than wear and tear, we will send out a replacement part at free of charge. 
Premium quality material everywhere.
MyCanoe can hold up to 440 lbs. With the stabilizers, it can hold up to 750 lbs.
The award winning MyCanoe is TUV certified, comparing stringently both better and/or similarly to other canoes.
On the off-chance that you have the misfortune of capsizing, there is no need to worry as MyCanoe still floats when capsized!
With 8 different seat positions, the possible ways to enjoy your MyCanoe are limitless.MyCanoe was specifically built to be a top performing canoe.  Although it folds up small for easy transport, make no mistake, it is at home in the water and has now problem surging forward with the help of a paddle.   See MyCanoe owners' reviews""The benefits of having a light folding canoe are tremendous, the more time you paddle the MyCanoe, the more you appreciate them."" See full review here.Click the photo to read another review, ""Sea Trial"". MyCanoe also offers additional options, including stabilizers and rowing system for added enjoyment, such as fishing or other activities. The stabilizer attachments take your canoe to the next level. Use them during regular nature wandering for extra steadiness or attach to your canoe for some relaxing stand-up fishing time.  The rowing system works brilliantly to keep paddles attached to the canoe so you can row effortlessly and easily without fear of the paddles floating away.Why paddle when you can row?  Our innovative oar lock kit allows you to row your canoe in style.  Slide gracefully through the water with speed! 


 Assembly and folding back is very quick and easy.  To demonstrate just how easy, we made this little video for you that shows every step.  From a carrying pack to a canoe in 10 minutes or less!

 

The inspiration for MyCanoe struck when founders, KS Jin and Jay Lee, were on vacation with friends. They brought a canoe with them and after having to stop multiple times to retighten the straps that were holding the canoe to the car, they knew there must be a better way. This is when they started experimenting with different folding canoes using origami. After settling on a design that they knew was a winner, Team MyCanoe then transformed that paper into the highly technical design your see now. However, despite being highly technical, it's easy enough for anyone to pull out and quickly assemble for a day on the water.    MyCanoe isn't just an idea, or a concept, or even a prototype for that matter.  It's a full fledged product ready to hit mainstream production.  Our team of engineers and designers has worked very hard for three long years to get to this point.  We wanted to make sure we had worked out every possible product bugs.  We tested and retested different assembly protocols, materials, and manufacturing sequences.  All to ensure that once you back, you will be the proud owner of your very own MyCanoe.  On Time and as Promised!     Launch of first prototype in 2015Shown above are our productive past 3 years. To the right you will see the earliest version, say 0.5! It was a good start, but left us a list of things to improve. This led us to the version 1.0 which you see in the middle. More ribbing, sturdier design, but still lacking. Version 2.0 is seen on the left. Much better... rigid, sturdy, lightweight and fast to set up.  It's been a brutal process to improve (if not perfect) this boat over the last 3 years but it has been worth every single step! Our current version 2.5 with this Kickstarter support will have only 4 ribs which will make for a lighter and faster assembly.Each and every boat is handcrafted with the utmost care.  No cutting corners here!Unlike other campaigns, our funds will be used to drive down the cost of parts, supplies, and manufacturing process.  You see.  We've already done the R&D on our dime.  We're not going to use your money for that.  Our manufacturing facility has been selected and our suppliers have been interviewed and vetted.This ensures that you get a top quality product and that you get it on time! SHIPPING DETAILSThe United States shipping cost is for shipping to the contiguous United States. There will be additional charge for Hawaii or Alaska. If you are in Hawaii or Alaska, please contact us with your shipping address for your options. If you're looking for hi-res images, you've come to the right place!  Click here for hi-res images of MyCanoe.  For media inquiries, please contact info@oricanoe.comWe are a team of engineers, architect, and entrepreneurs located in Knoxville, TN. We love outdoor activities and worked hard for the past 3 years to make this dream product available to everyone.

Coovy is well known for premium quality products at affordable pricing with exceptional customer service. Thank you for your continued support and we promise to continue improving MYCANOE.Here's to your next adventure!-Team MYCANOEQ. Are the International shipping costs accurate? It seems high.A. They are fairly close. The costs are based on actual quotes from several carriers. We will include your shipping invoice with your package. If we can secure better deals for certain countries, we will issue a refund for the difference. Q. How and where is the MyCanoe made? A. The current MyCanoe prototypes are made in South Korea. Co-founder, KS Jin, currently stays in Korea to ensure the continued development and quality manufacturing. As MyCanoe grows, our plan is to manufacture in the United States. We've already identified a few partners that could take on the job here in Knoxville, TN. Q. What is made of and how long will the MYCANOE last ?A. MYCANOE is made of a 5 mm double-layer custom polypropylene that is lightweight and extraordinarily strong. It is manufacturer rated for 20,000 fold cycles. We've tested in a various water/weather conditions and haven't yet found any issues. With proper care, a MYCANOE can last for years of paddling. Every component piece can be replaced in the event of breakage.Q. How do I care for MYCANOE?A. We recommend treating your MYCANOE as you would a fiberglass, wood, or skin-on-frame canoe: don’t drag it or bump into sharp things, store out of direct sunlight, and rinse the canoe thoroughly with fresh water after each use.Q. How stable is a MYCANOE?A. The MYCANOE is quite stable and difficult to capsize. However, we recommend that inexperienced paddlers go with a companion, and don't attempt to use the MYCANOE in conditions beyond their skill level.Q. Does the MYCANOE float?A. Yes, the MYCANOE is buoyant and will float even if it capsizes. However, we recommend taking every safety precaution, including personal flotation devices and equipping bow and stern with floating bags.Q. Will repeated folding weaken the hull?A. The body of MYCANOE is manufacturer rated for 20,000 fold cycles - that's a lot of folds!Q. Can I take MYCANOE on a plane?A. Yes, MYCANOE can be checked as luggage, and the best way to protect MYCANOE during transport is to cover with a protective material (e.g. blanket).Q. Can It Be Used For Fishing?A. Yes. With minor modifications the MyCanoe can be outfitted with a rod holder. Another great choice for outfitting your MyCanoe is with one of RAM's mounts— RAM Mounts makes a Tough Claw, that works perfectly on the MyCanoe.

<p>It all started with a scorched table.  </p>
<p>My family lives all around the world, so when my dad visited my brother Malek in Ivory Coast, they decided to have a barbecue to celebrate. Because there was no grill at hand, my father improvised on the spot and created his own Do-It-Yourself grill. The dinner was delicious, but as a result of grilling on the table, the table-top was scorched and ruined. Fortunately, the story didn't end there... After the incident, my father decided to work on a solution. After many trials and errors, his prototypes became my inspiration to create UNA Grill, the table-top charcoal grill to carry anywhere.</p>

Even though you only went away for some minutes, the tow truck has already arrived. That can cost you a pretty penny. Don't you think it would be great if there was a simple and affordable solution to that expensive problem? What if your car could just call you when it is in the way? With your help this will be possible soon.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>About me - Daniel Kalliontzis</h3>
<p>
</p><p>Did you know that in
Hamburg, Germany, there are more than 40,000 cars each year
that are towed away due to parking violations? That is annoying and
expensive for car owners – and it's a problem for every driver
in large cities. I grew up in Stuttgart, a large city in
southern Germany. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/905301/files/20141005050654-d.jpg?1412510814"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Now I live and work in the banking metropolis Frankfurt / Main in central Germany. Therefore I know that problem
very well from my own experience. </p><p>When my car was towed away
once, I asked myself: Is that really necessary? To
me, a freelancing IT consultant and passionate nerd, the answer to
that question was a real challenge. There had to be a technical
solution to that problem. I have always been annoyed by the sometimes
too quick towing jobs in some major cities in Germany. Therefore a way
out of that dilemma was of particular importance to me. </p><p>That is why I
tinkered and puzzled  until my idea of the TowStop became ready for everyday use. Now it shall find its way into everyday life and
maybe it will protect your vehicle from being towed away.</p><p><br/></p><h3>And that is how it works</h3><p>You can attach your TowStop to the windshield pretty easily with its suction cups. Then, activate it and it is ready to use. Now you can hurry to care for your urgent issues. You don't need to worry about a tow service getting your car because you missed a clearway sign.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/899504/files/20141002134115-towstop.jpg?1412282475"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p><div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I can attach the TowStop simply by sticking it to my windshield with its suctions cups? Is it really that simple? Yes, it is! You can stick it to the windshield like a mobile navigation system and remove it without a trace afterwards whenever you want.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/899394/files/20141002125701-Fotolia_54411228_S.jpg?1412279821"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Once sticking to the windshield, the TowStop can be activated by the police by a simple touch. TowStop will then deliver a message to the police via its display about how quick you will be able to remove the car. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/903330/files/20141004053733-en_sms.jpg?1412426253"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>TowStop works similar to a mobile phone. Thus, you only need to send the message you want it to show by SMS. If, for example, you send a message like „I will be back in 2 minutes“ to your TowStop, it will inform the police accordingly via its display. You need to send that SMS for programming the message only once. Afterwards, the programmed message is shown every time.  By sending a new SMS to you TowStop you can change the message whenever you want.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/899395/files/20141002125729-Fotolia_28838354_S.jpg?1412279849"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When activated by the police, the TowStop is not only delivering your message to the police, it also calls you to inform you that you must remove your car as quickly as possible. Therefore you just have to program your number into the device.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/901988/files/20141003130920-en_back.jpg?1412366960"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 603px;""/></p>
<div><br/></div>Via a mini USB connection you can recharge the device easily. You can use that connection for software updates, too. That makes updates quick and comfortable.<br/><p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/899397/files/20141002125758-Fotolia_30017222_S.jpg?1412279878"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 465px; cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>But will the police use my TowStop anyway?</h3>
<div>What if you have a TowStop in your car but the police does not use it? In fact, law in Germany says that an officer has to choose the most efficient and inexpensive way for the car owner to remove the vehicle. And to call the driver to let him or her remove the car is not only cheaper. Usually, it is also a lot quicker than a tow service. So, seen from the judicial point of view, the TowStop is the best alternative.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/899401/files/20141002130009-Fotolia_54388800_S.jpg?1412280009"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The TowStop has a red edging. That is why the police will have no trouble to find it quickly. Also, the lettering says in round terms what you have to do when you want the car to be removed. It is as easy as it can get.<br/>
</div>
<div>However, not only the police can use TowStop. It is also helpful if you park your car in front of a gateway or you block another car from driving away.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>The advantages of TowStop</h3>
<div>
<p>Everybody whose car has ever been towed away knows the high costs and the hassle. Due to its low purchase price TowStop repays already on the first occasion in which it is used. So, if you need a parking space in a crowded city quite often TowStop will repay soon. The operating costs are extremely low as well: You only need a prepaid SIM card. You need to charge this card only once as you will not have a chat with TowStop when it is calling you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/899403/files/20141002130035-Fotolia_2225780_S.jpg?1412280035"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Another advantage of this little helper in everyday life is that police has to use it according to existing law in Germany. That is why you can rely on your TowStop.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/902132/files/20141003140903-Fotolia_54973543_S.jpg?1412370543"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Moreover, you are free to choose any phone number you like to program it to your TowStop. You only need to program that number and from that moment on you will get a call when you must remove your vehicle. The number can be changed easily.</p>
<p>Sometimes technical solutions are difficult to apply. But that is not true for the TowStop. You stick it to the windshield and that's it. You don't need any tools and you don't need to make any alterations to your car either. You can use TowStop in every car - even in rentals.</p>

musste. </p><p>Ein Weg aus dem Dilemma lag mir schon deshalb am Herzen, weil
mich die mitunter sehr flotte Abschlepperei in deutschen Innenstädten
schon immer ärgerte. Deshalb habe ich 3 Jahre gebastelt und

Maybe you know that: you are in a hurry and you park your car just for a moment anywhere you find a space – and you miss the clearway sign. Even though you only went away for some minutes, the tow truck has already arrived. That can cost you a pretty penny. Don't you think it would be great if there was a simple and affordable solution to that expensive problem? What if your car could just call you when it is in the way? With your help this will be possible soon.About me - Daniel Kalliontzis

Did you know that in
Hamburg, Germany, there are more than 40,000 cars each year
that are towed away due to parking violations? That is annoying and
expensive for car owners – and it's a problem for every driver
in large cities. I grew up in Stuttgart, a large city in
southern Germany. Now I live and work in the banking metropolis Frankfurt / Main in central Germany. Therefore I know that problem
very well from my own experience. When my car was towed away
once, I asked myself: Is that really necessary? To
me, a freelancing IT consultant and passionate nerd, the answer to
that question was a real challenge. There had to be a technical
solution to that problem. I have always been annoyed by the sometimes
too quick towing jobs in some major cities in Germany. Therefore a way
out of that dilemma was of particular importance to me. That is why I
tinkered and puzzled  until my idea of the TowStop became ready for everyday use. Now it shall find its way into everyday life and
maybe it will protect your vehicle from being towed away.And that is how it worksYou can attach your TowStop to the windshield pretty easily with its suction cups. Then, activate it and it is ready to use. Now you can hurry to care for your urgent issues. You don't need to worry about a tow service getting your car because you missed a clearway sign.

I can attach the TowStop simply by sticking it to my windshield with its suctions cups? Is it really that simple? Yes, it is! You can stick it to the windshield like a mobile navigation system and remove it without a trace afterwards whenever you want.


Once sticking to the windshield, the TowStop can be activated by the police by a simple touch. TowStop will then deliver a message to the police via its display about how quick you will be able to remove the car. 




TowStop works similar to a mobile phone. Thus, you only need to send the message you want it to show by SMS. If, for example, you send a message like „I will be back in 2 minutes“ to your TowStop, it will inform the police accordingly via its display. You need to send that SMS for programming the message only once. Afterwards, the programmed message is shown every time.  By sending a new SMS to you TowStop you can change the message whenever you want.


When activated by the police, the TowStop is not only delivering your message to the police, it also calls you to inform you that you must remove your car as quickly as possible. Therefore you just have to program your number into the device.


Via a mini USB connection you can recharge the device easily. You can use that connection for software updates, too. That makes updates quick and comfortable.


But will the police use my TowStop anyway?
What if you have a TowStop in your car but the police does not use it? In fact, law in Germany says that an officer has to choose the most efficient and inexpensive way for the car owner to remove the vehicle. And to call the driver to let him or her remove the car is not only cheaper. Usually, it is also a lot quicker than a tow service. So, seen from the judicial point of view, the TowStop is the best alternative.



The TowStop has a red edging. That is why the police will have no trouble to find it quickly. Also, the lettering says in round terms what you have to do when you want the car to be removed. It is as easy as it can get.

However, not only the police can use TowStop. It is also helpful if you park your car in front of a gateway or you block another car from driving away.

The advantages of TowStop

Everybody whose car has ever been towed away knows the high costs and the hassle. Due to its low purchase price TowStop repays already on the first occasion in which it is used. So, if you need a parking space in a crowded city quite often TowStop will repay soon. The operating costs are extremely low as well: You only need a prepaid SIM card. You need to charge this card only once as you will not have a chat with TowStop when it is calling you.




Another advantage of this little helper in everyday life is that police has to use it according to existing law in Germany. That is why you can rely on your TowStop.


Moreover, you are free to choose any phone number you like to program it to your TowStop. You only need to program that number and from that moment on you will get a call when you must remove your vehicle. The number can be changed easily.
Sometimes technical solutions are difficult to apply. But that is not true for the TowStop. You stick it to the windshield and that's it. You don't need any tools and you don't need to make any alterations to your car either. You can use TowStop in every car - even in rentals.

It consists of several project contributors who volunteered their time and gas money to complete the mountains of field work needed to confirm the site's location. We have been researching the area formally on foot since 2009. Recently, during the summer of 2011, we successfully located the original film site and completed a detailed survey of the surviving monuments and trees. This survey has been an enormous contribution to the Bigfoot research community and can now be used to exact dimensional data from the film and make accurate measurement of the creature's pathway and size.<br/><br/>Trail camera survey:<br/><br/>The trail camera project was launched in July of 2012, and successfully raised enough money to purchase four high-end trail cameras. We committed all of our personal trail cameras to the project as well, for a total of nine cameras installed at the site. The cameras were installed in late October 2012 on the 45th anniversary of the film. The cameras spent seven months in total down at the film site, capturing the movements of Bluff Creek's inhabitants. We had a few camera failures, but all of the newly purchased cameras performed flawlessly.</p><p>We have learned many lessons and fought several battles to pull off the project. We captured hundreds of videos of bears, deer, and a cougar. I hope to publish a small research paper containing the findings and data after the completion of a total of one year of deployment of the cameras. We think that the summer and fall months are the most active for the area and wish to include them in the paper. After all, ""Patty"" was filmed in the PGF in late October, with reported activity preceding that in August, yet we didn't install the cameras until late October.<br/><br/>What we need:</p><p>We would like to continue the trail camera project over the winter of 2013/2014, and have a few needs for our continued success. We would like to raise enough money to purchase a couple new cameras, some bear-safe camera housings, and fresh batteries for the other cameras we currently have. We had amazing success with the 2012 Bushnell Trophy Cam, and wish to purchase new 2013 models.<br/><br/><br/>A list of their features can be viewed here:<br/><br/><a href=""http://bushnell.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bushnell.com</a><br/><br/>The current price on Amazon.com for all items needed is:<br/><br/>$223.35  - Trophy can HD Max<br/>$31.99  - Bear box for cameras<br/>$20.37  - 32gb SD memory card<br/>$22.99  - 12pk of Energizer lithium batteries<br/><br/>We intend this trail camera survey to be an open-source project, where all media and data is published immediately after collection for all the world to see. The main problem with similar camera projects is that all media and data is subject to strict non-disclosure agreements and stipulations. This is to protect any cash value associated with a potential Bigfoot image or video. We believe as a team that the commercialization of such a project is fundamentally unscientific.

It consists of several project contributors who volunteered their time and gas money to complete the mountains of field work needed to confirm the site's location. We have been researching the area formally on foot since 2009. Recently, during the summer of 2011, we successfully located the original film site and completed a detailed survey of the surviving monuments and trees. This survey has been an enormous contribution to the Bigfoot research community and can now be used to exact dimensional data from the film and make accurate measurement of the creature's pathway and size.Trail camera survey:The trail camera project was launched in July of 2012, and successfully raised enough money to purchase four high-end trail cameras. We committed all of our personal trail cameras to the project as well, for a total of nine cameras installed at the site. The cameras were installed in late October 2012 on the 45th anniversary of the film. The cameras spent seven months in total down at the film site, capturing the movements of Bluff Creek's inhabitants. We had a few camera failures, but all of the newly purchased cameras performed flawlessly.We have learned many lessons and fought several battles to pull off the project. We captured hundreds of videos of bears, deer, and a cougar. I hope to publish a small research paper containing the findings and data after the completion of a total of one year of deployment of the cameras. We think that the summer and fall months are the most active for the area and wish to include them in the paper. After all, ""Patty"" was filmed in the PGF in late October, with reported activity preceding that in August, yet we didn't install the cameras until late October.What we need:We would like to continue the trail camera project over the winter of 2013/2014, and have a few needs for our continued success. We would like to raise enough money to purchase a couple new cameras, some bear-safe camera housings, and fresh batteries for the other cameras we currently have. We had amazing success with the 2012 Bushnell Trophy Cam, and wish to purchase new 2013 models.A list of their features can be viewed here:http://bushnell.comThe current price on Amazon.com for all items needed is:$223.35  - Trophy can HD Max$31.99  - Bear box for cameras$20.37  - 32gb SD memory card$22.99  - 12pk of Energizer lithium batteriesWe intend this trail camera survey to be an open-source project, where all media and data is published immediately after collection for all the world to see. The main problem with similar camera projects is that all media and data is subject to strict non-disclosure agreements and stipulations. This is to protect any cash value associated with a potential Bigfoot image or video. We believe as a team that the commercialization of such a project is fundamentally unscientific.

Due to its lightweight and versatility, LIGHT WATER is the perfect device to purify water from the nearest streams, puddles, or ponds for outdoor activities. LIGHT WATER is the world's first portable automatic outdoor water purification device. Just press the switch twice and LIGHT WATER will automatically filter the water for you. No pump/press or any wait for the chemicals to work and you will save time for more outdoor enjoyment.  The super power provided by LIGHT WATER and high accuracy of FLEX-FLITER make the entire water purification process faster and more efficient. It can easily purify 9L of water in 10 minutes. It is no longer difficult to bathe and cook outdoors with clean water. It can easily solve water problems for more than 3 people on camping. Comprehensive protection is achievable by removing all waterborne pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoan cysts), heavy metals, and even microplastics with advanced safety filtration technology. The FLEX-FILTER can also be used separately to meet your lighter requirements. Backwash with clean water to ensure safer and longer service. No need to disassemble, no other tools, just press the switch, LIGHT WATER will automatically clean the filter for you.   If you're more concerned about the weight and volume of your water purifier, we recommend the LIGHT WATER mini.

<p class=""full-description"">This project is for developing a program to generate and use a Lossy Hash Table (LHT). A LHT is a time-memory trade-off for breaking unsalted or poorly salted password hashes. It is just a Hash Table (an indexed list of the full hashes and their corresponding passwords) but with missing information. The missing information is then brute forced. Normal settings are 3 bytes/password and under 100 ms. Any algorithm where you can use a Rainbow Table, you can use a Lossy Hash Table. The differences are Rainbow Tables take minutes and are probabilistic (99.9%) vs Lossy Hash Tables are ""instant"" and are deterministic (100%).</p>
<p class=""full-description"">The generator will be able to generate the table in-place. This means you only need enough disk space to hold the final table.</p>
<p class=""full-description"">All the code will be open source and licensed under aGPLv2/GPLv2.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p class=""full-description"">The idea is to expand the Lossy Hash Table (LHT) I designed over a year ago to trillions of keys or passwords. You can see it in <a href=""http://www.tobtu.com/md5.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">action</a> with over 50 billion MD5ed passwords, takes about 10 to 100 milliseconds, and is only 119 GB (18.85 bits/password). That example can't scale very much since it took 800 GB of temporary disk to generate. LHTs are not magic, each bit/password stored cuts the search space in half. In the 50 billion MD5 database, there is an index that costs 1.85 bits/password which gets you down to only needing to brute force a few password ranges (four at most).</p>
<p class=""full-description"">The only thing left is to finish the generalized version of the program that I wrote over a year ago.

<h3><strong>About Us</strong></h3>
<p>I am Becky Deadman and my wife, of almost 18 years, is Brenda St. Clair. After working most of our adult lives for corporate America, we are looking forward to a new chapter in our lives. We are looking forward to doing something that will make a difference in our lives and in the community.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Want </strong></h3>
<p>We want to create a safe and comfortable vacation spot for LGBT families and their allies. Right now in Michigan there are very few LGBT campgrounds and they are only for those 18 years of age and older.  We want to change that.  We want to provide a campground for adults AND families with children.  A place that is fun, exciting and the first choice for everyone's vacation destination.</p>
<p>We want kids with LGBT parents to meet other kids in similar types of families, to be able to feel comfortable and free to play and have great experiences without discrimination. We want parents with LGBT kids to meet other parents with LGBT kids, to be able to create friendships and find support where needed and feel safe to express themselves.</p>
<p>We want the resort to be a judgment/discrimination free zone; a place where LGBT people can be themselves without fear of any kind.</p>
<p>And last but not least we want to partner with the community to educate and inform. </p>
<h3><strong>How We Are Going to do it</strong></h3>
<p>With your help and generosity we will be able to buy a campground that has already been developed but not in operation for some time.  There are a lot of upgrades and repairs that need to be completed before it can re-open.  In the end we will create the best campground resort for LGBT families in Michigan. The amenities will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tent campsites-rustic and water/electric</li>
<li>RV full hook-up</li>
<li>furnished cabins</li>
<li>shower facilities</li>
<li>game room</li>
<li>community event building</li>
<li>pavilions</li>
<li>playground</li>
<li>outdoor exercise park</li>
<li>pool</li>
<li>water park</li>
<li>basketball court</li>
<li>volley ball court</li>
<li>horseshoe pits</li>
<li>camp store</li>
<li>laundry facilities</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<p>We need to have a space for our community to gather, feel safe, comfortable and have a great time. </p>
<p>Our community events center will be equipped to handle small intimate affairs as well as very large parties.  We will make our resort the one that everyone thinks of first to plan events, fundraisers, day camps etc.</p>
<p>We will partner with schools, non-profits, and community organizations in order to meet their needs as well as our own. </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>The Busy Bs' Campground Resort will be a great one of a kind place for LGBT families and friends to be free.  A place to make lasting memories, it will be a place where the community can come together to celebrate diversity educate one another and inform the world that we are here and deserve to be treated like everyone else.</p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute finacially you can still help us by spreading the word.  Share our campign with family, friends, co-workers, and anyone else that wants to make a difference. </p>
<p>You can also be of help once the campground is purchased.  We will need a lot of people power to help get the camground up and running.  There will be lots of trees to move, lots of yardwork to complete, electrical and plumbing work to do and lot of other miscellaneous jobs.</p></div>","About Us

The Busy Bs' Campground Resort will be a great one of a kind place for LGBT families and friends to be free.  A place to make lasting memories, it will be a place where the community can come together to celebrate diversity educate one another and inform the world that we are here and deserve to be treated like everyone else.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to contribute finacially you can still help us by spreading the word.  Share our campign with family, friends, co-workers, and anyone else that wants to make a difference. 
You can also be of help once the campground is purchased.  We will need a lot of people power to help get the camground up and running.  There will be lots of trees to move, lots of yardwork to complete, electrical and plumbing work to do and lot of other miscellaneous jobs.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
