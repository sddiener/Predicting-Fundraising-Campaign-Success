<p>We are undecided on the future revenue model for the Facebook Beginner Kit – application, guide and tutorial. We would like it to be self-sustainable yet affordable to all – and 50% of isolated seniors are financially challenged. We hope to discuss the possible approaches with our supporter group – you!

<p class=""full-description"">P.S. An Unexpected Reward</p>
<p>This project started as a tribute to our parents, our mothers. They gave us this world, and it felt right to try and give them access of our new world – our life online.</p>
<p>Quite unexpectedly, two months into the project I received a special reward – and please decide how valuable it could be. While researching the aging segment, I came across some interesting studies suggesting that thanks to advances in biosciences and improved lifestyle options, people in their 40s – including myself – will live on average about 100 years. Prior to that I had a number of around 75-80 in mind. Those who are fortunate to be in their 20s and 30s will likely get to 110-115 mark.</p>
<p>Better still, as Greta, Francis, Franco and many other seniors proved beyond all doubt, we can live an active life that goes well beyond our sixties.</p>
<p>The Stanford Center for Longevity recommends planning for longer, and more fun-filled life. Taking year long mini-retirements now and then, and taking the time to enjoy life, is a viable option. My life plan is now being revamped – there’s more time left than I could have imagined.</p>
<p>Yet another reason to say ‘Thanks!’ to my Mom and Dad!</p>

End of Mother's Day Update
 
Why 17 Million Grandmas Initiative?
1. Being online helps stay in touch. Vital.


2. Our easy and safe app gets Grandma on Facebook in 30 minutes


3. The EasyFamily Social®app is available NOW for iPad, Mac, and Windows PC!
Grandma can be on Facebook this Mother's Day!
Please download the app for FREE at www.EasyFamilySocial.com 


 

Get your Grandma the best Mother’s Day Gift possible! 

 

 

Please help us develop the Android version!
4. Thank you! You will find the complete infographic and more interesting information on the project below.
We are now at mid private beta stage with a few features in the pipeline. We can commit the following timeline — App and User guide — release of the functional stable public beta to our supporter group by 1st of May — certainly in time for Mother's Day — 12 May 2013. Tutorial — 15 of June — Father's Day.

 


How we’ll allocate the budget
$8k is budgeted to go towards app development. $2k is budgeted towards User Guide and Tutorial . We hope to get features voted in/out by supporters – this will help us optimize the App and Guide/Tutorial budgets.
How will we make it sustainable?
We are undecided on the future revenue model for the Facebook Beginner Kit – application, guide and tutorial. We would like it to be self-sustainable yet affordable to all – and 50% of isolated seniors are financially challenged. We hope to discuss the possible approaches with our supporter group – you! One idea we had is ‘honor-ware model’ – pay as much as you feel fair – if you can pay at all.
5. Project expert support


Mary Furlong, Founder SeniorNet, Third Age Media, Mary Furlong and Associates, Expert in Aging
“The importance of being online is to connect generations, to connect people together, to mitigate the loneliness that some older adults feel as they are farther away from friends and family.
 


Jim Tobias, Inclusive Technologies, Strategies and Stakeholders at RaisingtTheFloor.org Mission: “To make the web and mobile technologies accessible to everyone with disability, literacy and aging-related barriers, regardless of their economic status.”
“The app is a great example of how an aggregating service can unify what the user experiences, and simplify both choices and layout so that users with limited abilities and low confidence can succeed.“

Laurie Orlov,Founder, Aging in Place Technology Watch, Leading Industry Analyst, VP, Forrester Research Expert in Aging Technologies
“I believe that 100% of older adults need to be online, that the Internet has enabled people to have access to other people, to information, to socialization that otherwise they will be completely missing.
The best thing you can do for an older adult as we come into Mother’s Day and Father’s Day is help people get the training they need, get the access they need, get the devices they need and help them get online.”

P.S. An Unexpected Reward
This project started as a tribute to our parents, our mothers. They gave us this world, and it felt right to try and give them access of our new world – our life online.
Quite unexpectedly, two months into the project I received a special reward – and please decide how valuable it could be. While researching the aging segment, I came across some interesting studies suggesting that thanks to advances in biosciences and improved lifestyle options, people in their 40s – including myself – will live on average about 100 years. Prior to that I had a number of around 75-80 in mind. Those who are fortunate to be in their 20s and 30s will likely get to 110-115 mark.
Better still, as Greta, Francis, Franco and many other seniors proved beyond all doubt, we can live an active life that goes well beyond our sixties.
The Stanford Center for Longevity recommends planning for longer, and more fun-filled life. Taking year long mini-retirements now and then, and taking the time to enjoy life, is a viable option. My life plan is now being revamped – there’s more time left than I could have imagined.
Yet another reason to say ‘Thanks!’ to my Mom and Dad!

<p>Stower is a leader in personal energy product engineering and design. Together with our manufacturing partner PCH, Stower makes smart, reliable energy products that 1) do their job and 2) do it well.</p>
<p>The Candle Charger contains two core pieces of technology: </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>A thermoelectric module, also known as a Peltier cooler. Thermoelectric modules are semiconductor devices that convert temperature gradients – one side hot, one side cold – into electricity. The Candle Charger uses nontoxic bismuth telluride-based modules, which have been in mass production for over twenty years for scientific, refrigeration, and automotive industries. </li></ul>
<ul><li>The Stower smart circuit that conditions the power coming from the module to match power requirements of the device being charged (e.g. a smartphone). </li></ul>
<p>What makes the Candle Charger an important innovation is the conversion efficiency of the device, its electrical strategy, and the focus on design for indoor use. </p>
<p><i>Conversion Efficiency</i></p>
<p>The Candle Charger achieves class-leading power output from thermoelectric modules, providing reliable USB power over extended periods of operation. We do this through a combination of patented mechanical engineering steps to optimize heat transfer from the candle, to the thermoelectric module, and into the water bath; careful control over thermal interfaces; and spatial design to position the Candle Charger relative to a heat source (i.e. the candle).</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447719186/rjl27rjjrzmyy1odzkxy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><i>Electrical Strategy </i></p>
<p>To increase cost savings and overall efficiency, Stower directly charges your electronic devices rather than charge an intermediate battery. We’re able to do this through circuitry developed exclusively for Stower products that</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">continually monitors the power output from the thermoelectric generator,</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">boosts the voltage to USB standard 5V,</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">conditions the power from the generator so it matches internal charging requirements of smartphones, switching between “bands” of acceptable current levels and gradually dropping the voltage so phones don’t drop the charge,</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">provides LED indicator sequences to clearly show power availability – a flashing light means power is available, while a stead light means steady power is achieved and the power output is “iPhone ready.” </span></li>

<p><i>Designed for Indoor Use</i></p>
<p>We began with energy - the candle - and built the Candle Charger from there. The Candle Charger is sturdy enough to work outdoors, but its sleek design fits in with other beautiful shelf items for in-home storage and use. </p>

<p>The handle and locking mechanism are necessary features that provide safe interface with the water bath during operation and collapsability for anywhere storage. The all-aluminum exterior - designed for maximum thermal efficiency - lends a modern look while being durable enough to take outdoors.</p>

<h2>Why EZstand ?</h2>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our hands are meant to be used for a variety of unlimited chores. The world has limited our freedom of movement as now we are all busy holding our devices, some of us for hours. Almost all of our information is inside this device which does have an advantage but we having to hold our Smartphone’s constantly brings inconvenience especially during the viewing. Even if we put our phone on a table or another surface, we still need to bend over with our heads in our screens, making this both limiting and uncomfortable.</span></h4>
<div>
<h4>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This reason alone led me to look for a combined solution and to come up with this exclusive design patent:</span> ""EZstand"".</h4>

   Welcome to  Project 
 

 



 













          



Why EZstand ?
Our hands are meant to be used for a variety of unlimited chores. The world has limited our freedom of movement as now we are all busy holding our devices, some of us for hours. Almost all of our information is inside this device which does have an advantage but we having to hold our Smartphone’s constantly brings inconvenience especially during the viewing. Even if we put our phone on a table or another surface, we still need to bend over with our heads in our screens, making this both limiting and uncomfortable.


This reason alone led me to look for a combined solution and to come up with this exclusive design patent: ""EZstand"".

<h3><span>Short Summary</span></h3>
<p><span>We had this idea back in September that we thought could change the world. We worked on it day and night, countless hours, for 7 months, until it finally grew into a Company called GetWithIt. Now we need your help with the next step to help my team and I push this dream forward.</span></p>
<p><span>GetWithIt is a mobile app that allows people to find &amp; post parties and events in real-time. The simple layout makes it as easy as an ""Instagram for Events""(see alpha demo video).</span></p>
<p><span>We would like to grow this product to the next stage. Our team has already proven that we can create an app with our alpha release designed for investors and promotion. And now we want to tweak it, implement the NEW &amp; slick design and launch it for the public this fall.</span></p>
<p><span>We already have 20,000 people on our Facebook page per week and 3,000 likes in a short period of time!</span></p>
<p><span>With the genius devlopment and design team we are outsourcing from India, we can literally see every dollar be spent to the different parts of creating the app. We WILL have this app in the store this fall and I am proud to finally be able to say it.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>We had a dream back in September. The dream was to make an app that would help students and other people be more active, find events that interest them and meet new friends. Our dream is to let GetWithIt change the world.</span></p>

<h3>What is Qurate?</h3>
<p>In 2013, we have more ways to communicate than ever. It can be quite a task to remember who is on what medium or which social network your cousin sent you their phone number on. It can get confusing because humans don’t think in terms of HOW they spoke with someone. They think about WHO they spoke with. </p>
<p>Enter Qurate. Qurate is a mobile-first iPhone application that helps you more easily communicate with each of your 30 closest relationships, no matter what social network they use. There’s three steps to using Qurate: sign-up to the social networks you use, choose the friends that you want to add, and start messaging! Qurate does all the work. It brings together your Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail accounts and reorganizes the communication based on the people you chose. You can respond to your best friend’s @mention on Twitter and your mother’s personal message on Facebook, all from within the same app. Here are some reasons you’ll love using it: </p>
<ul>
<li>Qurate is your favorites list on steroids</li>
<li>View your important communication across your Twitter, Facebook, and Gmail</li>
<li>Respond to friends on the same medium they chose to message you from one screen</li>
<li>Keep up with up to 30 friends who are on different social networks</li>
<li>Activate the optional language filter to protect if autocorrect tries to use unwanted profanities</li>
<li>Post directly to Facebook and Twitter simultaneously</li>
<li>Use one app to see your communication with those important to you</li>
<li>No more forgetting where your friend sent something to you</li>
<li>Automagically merge the contact information of your friends from your contacts, Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail</li>

<p>Qurate was started with the desire to revolutionize how technology views our human relationships. I've been very involved in social media for years and I've utilized different social networks due to their particular focus on communication. Problem was, it was always frustrating that my friendships seemed like they were locked away on each individual social network. There was no central hub to keep up with my interactions with my favorite people. After years of working on the concept, I took the plunge and started Qurate, a people-focused company. I've been incredibly amazed by the community that has begun to surround Qurate. </p>

<p>This is my first foray into the world of start-ups. My background is people. I've worked in the retail industry for years and one of the most important things that I've learned is that people simply want to be heard. With Qurate your voice doesn't diminish due to the sheer volume of communications that social media prompts daily. I've been able to look at the social media interactions I've had with my wife across multiple platforms going back months on one feed.

<h3>Spread the word to help you get more ABS sample filaments! The more kits we sell, the more free samples we can add and the closer you get to the Ultimate Sampler Pack!</h3>
<h3>The free sample of Makerbot ABS filament included in your kit will allow you to try this brand of ABS over your current brand. This will allow you to see how Makerbot's ABS polishes better then some other brands. We have not gotten any bubbles or imperfections when using Makerbot ABS, but we have had these issues with cheaply manufactured ABS filaments.</h3>
<h2>UPDATE on INFORMATION REQUESTED</h2>
<p>     The Touch-Up is a 0.5 gallon glass container. You can place items 6"" tall by 4-3/4"" wide.</p>
<h3>How The Touch-Up Works</h3>
<p>     The Touch-Up utilizes a<strong> vapor sanding process</strong> in which it uses<strong> Acetone vapors</strong> to smooth and  polish ABS plastic. Times of processing vary depending on the<strong> size</strong> and <strong>Layer thickness</strong> of each model printed. A very small model could take 15 to 25 minutes while a larger model could take 45 minutes. It is important that you often check your model often to ensure the desired amount of polishing. You want to be sure not to over-polish as Acetone melts ABS, making it softer.  <strong>(Check your model by <em>looking</em>, <em>do not remove</em> lid while product is warm. </strong><strong>If used in a well ventilated area you can open the lid to flip/rotate the model to get a better overall coverage) </strong></p>
<p>     Depending on the brand of ABS you are using, <strong>results may vary</strong> (as stated in the video credits). We recommend Makerbot's ABS filament because it responds very well the process everytime we've used it. Other brands of ABS may produce air pockets that cause tiny holes to form when going through the Acetone Vapor Process, ruining your models.</p>
<p>    The amount of Acetone also <strong>varies</strong> depending on the <strong>size</strong> of your model. I always start at <strong>1 Tablespoon</strong> for smaller models, and for larger surface areas I use <strong>2 Tablespoons</strong>. More may be needed. Time your process with the brand of plastic to get an understanding on how much acetone to apply. <strong>If correct amount is used you should have a beautifully polished ABS Model with no acetone left inside the glass container. </strong>   </p>
<p>     We posted an Instructional Video on YouTube when we started this campaign (found <a href=""http://youtu.be/m0ikuKum8Q4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a> and at the bottom of the page).</p>

<p>     The Touch-Up is a product used to smooth and polish rough edges due to the 3D Printing Process. Achieve amazing results using various print layers. Imagine a finish you can see yourself in! Literally! STOP WASTING TIME hand sanding and hand polishing your 3D printed ABS models. Let The Touch-Up do it for you! This product allows you to get professional looking models faster by letting The Touch-Up smooth your print for you while another model prints.</p>
<p>     We found that when using Makerbots ABS filament, we were able to get faster polishing times with a great overall consistency with each model polished. (Same filament used in our video and pictures)</p>

<p> </p>
<p>     I got into 3D Printing a year and a half ago. I mostly used my 3D Printer for misc. projects such as, custom snowflakes and ornaments for Christmas, fixing/creating parts for other devices and projects, and designing and printing my own Rep-Raps. I used to spend a lot of time finishing my models after they were printed to get a really clean and smooth surface. I tried different techniques from spray enamel to dipping the part in different chemicals. It took months until I figured out the best method for polishing 3D printed ABS models. That was to submerse the ABS model in Acetone vapor. From that came the idea of vapor sanding and The Touch-Up was conceived.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                       <img alt=""Building The Touch-Up"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1367.photobucket.com/albums/r781/3DCustomizationCo/Indiegogo/BuildingTheTouch-Up_zpsf7b17d5b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>     The first obstacle was the heating element. I used 32 Nickle-Chromium resistance wire (common heating element). This works by dispersing the electricity in the form of heat. To contain the heat I used two stainless steel plates (one coated with temp resistant paint). Then bolted the steel plates to a stainless steel wire trivet frame, which is used not only to raise the heating element off the ground as not to damage sensitive surfaces, but also provides a holder for the glass container. The container used is a 0.5 gallon glass container with lid. The lid does not seal to the container, as not to create/build pressure (which would be very dangerous). The lid is only held on by its own weight. This is so Oxygen gets pushed out of the top. The lid then contains the Acetone vapor inside the glass container. The glass container can then be removed from the heating unit to cool and condense any leftover Acetone. (If the proper amount of Acetone is used there should be no leftover Acetone, the ABS model should absorb the vapor). Always start with a small amount, add more if necessary. All that was left was to lift the model off the surface of the glass container, so we added a platform for the model to rest on. I also wanted to be able to turn the heating unit off, and know that was in fact, off. To do this, I was sure to include an ON/OFF switch cable, with LED light indicator in the 3D Printed electronics case. Then, The Touch-Up was born.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>     Our Goal is simple. After struggling to get professional looking finishes, we want to get The Touch-Up into as many hands as possible so that everyone can get professional looking ABS models. <em>Unleash your creativity</em> and show it off <em>in style</em>! (ABS is the choice of many Engineers due to its Strength and Resilience.)</p>
<p><strong>    Even if our ultimate goal is not obtained, everyone will still receive their pledged perk.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>     The Travel Tote was initially a stretch goal at $35,000 - but we wanted to be sure everyone got one, regardless of if we were able to reach that goal. We wanted those people who like to travel and/or plan to travel the ability to take The Touch-Up anywhere! It provides a nice case for The Touch-Up or it can be used as a re-usable grocery bag!</p>

Spread the word to help you get more ABS sample filaments! The more kits we sell, the more free samples we can add and the closer you get to the Ultimate Sampler Pack!
The free sample of Makerbot ABS filament included in your kit will allow you to try this brand of ABS over your current brand. This will allow you to see how Makerbot's ABS polishes better then some other brands. We have not gotten any bubbles or imperfections when using Makerbot ABS, but we have had these issues with cheaply manufactured ABS filaments.
UPDATE on INFORMATION REQUESTED
     The Touch-Up is a 0.5 gallon glass container. You can place items 6"" tall by 4-3/4"" wide.
How The Touch-Up Works
     The Touch-Up utilizes a vapor sanding process in which it uses Acetone vapors to smooth and  polish ABS plastic. Times of processing vary depending on the size and Layer thickness of each model printed. A very small model could take 15 to 25 minutes while a larger model could take 45 minutes. It is important that you often check your model often to ensure the desired amount of polishing. You want to be sure not to over-polish as Acetone melts ABS, making it softer.  (Check your model by looking, do not remove lid while product is warm. If used in a well ventilated area you can open the lid to flip/rotate the model to get a better overall coverage) 
     Depending on the brand of ABS you are using, results may vary (as stated in the video credits). We recommend Makerbot's ABS filament because it responds very well the process everytime we've used it. Other brands of ABS may produce air pockets that cause tiny holes to form when going through the Acetone Vapor Process, ruining your models.
    The amount of Acetone also varies depending on the size of your model. I always start at 1 Tablespoon for smaller models, and for larger surface areas I use 2 Tablespoons. More may be needed. Time your process with the brand of plastic to get an understanding on how much acetone to apply. If correct amount is used you should have a beautifully polished ABS Model with no acetone left inside the glass container.    
     We posted an Instructional Video on YouTube when we started this campaign (found HERE and at the bottom of the page).

     I got into 3D Printing a year and a half ago. I mostly used my 3D Printer for misc. projects such as, custom snowflakes and ornaments for Christmas, fixing/creating parts for other devices and projects, and designing and printing my own Rep-Raps. I used to spend a lot of time finishing my models after they were printed to get a really clean and smooth surface. I tried different techniques from spray enamel to dipping the part in different chemicals. It took months until I figured out the best method for polishing 3D printed ABS models. That was to submerse the ABS model in Acetone vapor. From that came the idea of vapor sanding and The Touch-Up was conceived.
 
 
 
 
                       
 
     The first obstacle was the heating element. I used 32 Nickle-Chromium resistance wire (common heating element). This works by dispersing the electricity in the form of heat. To contain the heat I used two stainless steel plates (one coated with temp resistant paint). Then bolted the steel plates to a stainless steel wire trivet frame, which is used not only to raise the heating element off the ground as not to damage sensitive surfaces, but also provides a holder for the glass container. The container used is a 0.5 gallon glass container with lid. The lid does not seal to the container, as not to create/build pressure (which would be very dangerous). The lid is only held on by its own weight. This is so Oxygen gets pushed out of the top. The lid then contains the Acetone vapor inside the glass container. The glass container can then be removed from the heating unit to cool and condense any leftover Acetone. (If the proper amount of Acetone is used there should be no leftover Acetone, the ABS model should absorb the vapor). Always start with a small amount, add more if necessary. All that was left was to lift the model off the surface of the glass container, so we added a platform for the model to rest on. I also wanted to be able to turn the heating unit off, and know that was in fact, off. To do this, I was sure to include an ON/OFF switch cable, with LED light indicator in the 3D Printed electronics case. Then, The Touch-Up was born.

<p><strong>FantasyLeagueOne</strong> is a one stop fantasy sports dashboard portal. Instead of being required to log in to multiple websites to manage your fantasy teams or monitor your scores, you simply log in to <strong>FantasyLeagueOne </strong>with a simple click and you're all set to do whatever you desire.</p>
<p><strong>FantasyLeagueOne, LLC </strong>is offering you the chance to support <strong>FantasyLeagueOne</strong> through our Indiegogo program. We've got a very good baseline website developed to show you but we need your help to launch and make it a reality! Your generous pledges will further fuel the development of the website, propel it's attention to the major players in the industry, and help make <strong>FantasyLeagueOne</strong> the best it can be!</p>
<p>We're looking to raise $15,000 to cover advanced development of the website, marketing/advertising, and incentives for larger fantasy websites to partner with. Every single penny pledged will be put towards each of these goals. The members of our team are working diligently to make this happen and in return for your support, we are offering a variety of rewards - check out the sidebar for details. In the event that we exceed our target, all additional funds will also be invested into the project for a sleek &amp; sexy design, smooth functionality, and an app for iPhone/Android. *Reward shipping set for US only, please contact us directly if you required shipping outside of the United States*</p>

<p><em>BACKGROUND</em><br/><br/> First, a little bit of background. We are avid sports fans and even crazier fantasy sports fans! Okay, that’s enough of the boring stuff. Let’s get onto the goodies! <br/><br/><em>GOODIES</em><br/><br/> Take a look at what our typical Sunday looks like. We have to either work in 5 tabs or 5 separate windows! What a mess.<img alt=""Tabs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/0tsv2k6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Yes, we are crazy and manage 5 teams in 5 different leagues on 3 different sites. Logging into each of these sites every time we need to check our roster, make a trade or do whatever, it can really add up. Half the time we can’t even remember our login credentials! This hassle really rains on our football parade as we lounge on the couch football Sunday with our computers in our laps. We should quickly be able to check out how bad we're dominating people and enjoy watching the football game at the same time!</p>

<p><strong>Mike Linquist</strong> <em><strong>Founder and Chief Marketing Officer</strong></em></p>
<p>Mr. Michael is considered to be synonymous with greatness in most countries. It is for this exact reason how he thought up this idea with his computer in his lap on his couch watching football on a very sexy Sunday. Now, here is how it all went down: Cursing out the crappy touch pad on his laptop scrolling through 6 internet tabs to observe how his 6 teams were doing in 6 leagues through a few different websites, he thought to himself, ""Why dafuq can I not have ONE page open where I can view the status of ALL my fantasy teams?""</p>
<p>Hence - the idea.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/397/963/76c9cd819f0e23bce5215c937fc50ecf_large.png?1361336340"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>James Raines</strong> <em><strong>Co-Founder and Chief Financial Officer</strong></em></p>
<p>James F'ing Raines is viewed, predominantly by most, as a nerdy nutritionist. He disguises his nutritionist career aspirations by day while he slaves away as a server administrator for meager pay. While pretending to provide server administrator support, he peruses his fantasy sports leagues where he typically boasts a less than .500 pct record. This website will become very ideal for James as he won’t need to waste much time to review his fantasy losses by traveling to a single website. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/397/964/df6ec6d1355e9c5068ea430856a7f693_large.png?1361336366"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Matt Lindahl</strong> <em><strong>Co-Founder and Chief Information Officer</strong></em></p>
<p>Nerd by day and nerd by night, Matthilda Lindahl has driven the term nerd to the extreme. This is good in our case, as he has the technical aptitude that has been the backbone of our website development. If we can somehow maintain his focus on the website and not shopping for suits to mingle at drinking events as if he were James Bond, his efforts and labor should provide a very superb outcome.</p>

<p>We foresee that Coding/Development bugs and acquiring API from other fantasy websites will be the biggest challenge, however, we will have much more leverage upon a successful Indiegogo funding, so we see this as a minor risk.</p></div>","Manage all your fantasy sports, and view all of your leagues, any way you want, from one source!



FantasyLeagueOne is a one stop fantasy sports dashboard portal. Instead of being required to log in to multiple websites to manage your fantasy teams or monitor your scores, you simply log in to FantasyLeagueOne with a simple click and you're all set to do whatever you desire.
FantasyLeagueOne, LLC is offering you the chance to support FantasyLeagueOne through our Indiegogo program. We've got a very good baseline website developed to show you but we need your help to launch and make it a reality! Your generous pledges will further fuel the development of the website, propel it's attention to the major players in the industry, and help make FantasyLeagueOne the best it can be!
We're looking to raise $15,000 to cover advanced development of the website, marketing/advertising, and incentives for larger fantasy websites to partner with. Every single penny pledged will be put towards each of these goals. The members of our team are working diligently to make this happen and in return for your support, we are offering a variety of rewards - check out the sidebar for details. In the event that we exceed our target, all additional funds will also be invested into the project for a sleek & sexy design, smooth functionality, and an app for iPhone/Android. *Reward shipping set for US only, please contact us directly if you required shipping outside of the United States*

So what makes FLO worth your pledge? At FantasyLeagueOne, LLC. we are, first and foremost, fantasy sports players! We love the idea of having a single, truly customizable experience regardless of which site you use. Since this doesn't exist, we decided to build it ourselves.
ABOUT US : COMPANY
BACKGROUND First, a little bit of background. We are avid sports fans and even crazier fantasy sports fans! Okay, that’s enough of the boring stuff. Let’s get onto the goodies! GOODIES Take a look at what our typical Sunday looks like. We have to either work in 5 tabs or 5 separate windows! What a mess.
Yes, we are crazy and manage 5 teams in 5 different leagues on 3 different sites. Logging into each of these sites every time we need to check our roster, make a trade or do whatever, it can really add up. Half the time we can’t even remember our login credentials! This hassle really rains on our football parade as we lounge on the couch football Sunday with our computers in our laps. We should quickly be able to check out how bad we're dominating people and enjoy watching the football game at the same time!

Dashboard *beta

Easily switch between leagues/sites

After switching leagues/sites with one click, notice league info changes
FUTURE
Focusing on the future, we are gearing to appeal to a broader range of audiences by adding features such as ""Pick'em games, Playoff challenges, March Madness, etc."" BOOM! THERE YA HAVE IT - One site, one login, and working on your next fantasy title. All the information and tools you need are pulled in from major fantasy sites into one single ""portal"" if you will. Want to rearrange your dashboards? No problem, move them around as you see fit. You'll never want to use another fantasy sports site again! Now go out there and kick some ass!
ABOUT US : FOUNDERS

Mike Linquist Founder and Chief Marketing Officer
Mr. Michael is considered to be synonymous with greatness in most countries. It is for this exact reason how he thought up this idea with his computer in his lap on his couch watching football on a very sexy Sunday. Now, here is how it all went down: Cursing out the crappy touch pad on his laptop scrolling through 6 internet tabs to observe how his 6 teams were doing in 6 leagues through a few different websites, he thought to himself, ""Why dafuq can I not have ONE page open where I can view the status of ALL my fantasy teams?""
Hence - the idea.

James Raines Co-Founder and Chief Financial Officer
James F'ing Raines is viewed, predominantly by most, as a nerdy nutritionist. He disguises his nutritionist career aspirations by day while he slaves away as a server administrator for meager pay. While pretending to provide server administrator support, he peruses his fantasy sports leagues where he typically boasts a less than .500 pct record. This website will become very ideal for James as he won’t need to waste much time to review his fantasy losses by traveling to a single website. 

Matt Lindahl Co-Founder and Chief Information Officer
Nerd by day and nerd by night, Matthilda Lindahl has driven the term nerd to the extreme. This is good in our case, as he has the technical aptitude that has been the backbone of our website development. If we can somehow maintain his focus on the website and not shopping for suits to mingle at drinking events as if he were James Bond, his efforts and labor should provide a very superb outcome.

85% of Ethiopian GDP comes from agriculture


The agricultural sector faces both natural and man-made problems – like
plant disease, flooding, deforestation and drought etc…

Farmers lack a means to know plant/crop and/or soil status, and environmental conditions - they simply relay on ineffective and inefficient traditional methods

The impact of these types of problems affects productivity of the sector
and the country’s GDP

Being able to monitor a farm field with reliable and actual data is a
key to prevent it from such problems



What we think can be done - Use of technology

Wireless
Sensor Networks   




Efficient

Affordable
Low power
consumption
Able to sense
environment and forward sensed data using wireless or mobile communication
technologies
Environmental
friendly


Mobile phones


The use of mobile phone is rapidly growing in Africa
Many of Ethiopian farmers own a mobile phone
But mostly use it only to access central market to check product prices



What we have done so far:



A research taking the case of irrigation farms in Eastern Showa zone in Oromia
region in Ethiopia


A prototype of the whole system using open source platforms (including a
web and mobile based applications) 



What we want to do next:
Develop a working product based on the prototype:



Develop improved mobile application


Program sensor devices and package them


Test sensor products in real time and in different environmental
conditions


Deploy the whole system and test with an actual user (a farmer in
Ethiopia)


Make
it ready for next phase (to mass production and market)



What we need
from you:

Be part of the campaign and help us realize this project by: 



Generously contributing


Spreading the news to others

Forwarding valuable ideas and tips to the success of the campaign 

Who we are:
We are a team of passionate Software Engineers who want to contribute our part in making farmers' life easier with the use of such technologies.

<p></p></div>","Follow us at thecrowdfundingcentre........click here We are a new startup called 'BluVapp' and we are launching our device & Smartphone application that will revolutionize the electronic cigarette and electric hub (Vape) market. We have developed  a screw-on Bluetooth component that fits most popular brands of existing electronic cigarette or electronic Vape devices. Our BluVapp device is Bluetooth enabled and communicates with any Android, Apple or Windows based smartphone. The smartphone downloadable application controls the add-on control component. Your funding  secures the next step of manufacture and supply worldwide.   






After deciding to quit smoking, David looked at all the available 'STOP SMOKING' products out there, and decided on an electronic Cigarette.  He bought an entry level starter pack and 1 2 3....... He was Vaping. As someone who loves new Technology this was just for him. His only concern was the articles he kept reading, stating how people are getting too much Nicotine from these devices.  But as he was happy with his new Vaping friend so this information drifted into the smoke in the background. Then it dawned on David... The  analogue cigarette has an 'off' switch... When you get to the cigarette filter... That was it!!!   No more until you lit another one. Then the question was asked... How can you do this in an electronic cigarette?  And the idea was born, put a Bluetooth controlled 'unit' between the battery and the coil. Then build a powerful smartphone application to control the 'unit'. The idea grew for you, the user, to have much more control over your Vaping experience.  This allows for the individual to have full control.
10 minutes smoking - 30 minutes break ... more / less... you decide via the settings on your smartphone BluVapp app.
The possibilities grew, and we began  adding features that make the experience so much better:
lost my e-cig on the first day.... Ok let's add a Bluetooth Finder then I'll never lose it again.
A habit tracking mechanism......lets the user see how much they have vaped in a day, a month or a year.

A voltage regulator allowing you to control the resistance to your atomizer, controlled by you, via your smartphone.
Now these ideas have become a reality, where everyone can bring there    e-cig into the digital age without changing there e-cigarette. Small, state of the art and easy to fit.  (Fits most popular brands, if it doesn't fit yours... Be sure we are working on it!!)If you want to Quit!

Helps you control your smoking/Vaping by only allowing you to use your e-cig or PV at specific times that you pre set via your smartphone app.


Design a program to help you quit.


Motivates you cut down with ease.

By designing a smart system that allows activity and rhythm to be recorded over time, you will have a safer and more effective way to monitor your juice use and enhance your experience.....The controls within the BluVapp Device and Application, can easily monitor and track data from your e-cigarette, including battery life, moderate flow by adjusting Voltage, monitor your activity and other trends in the e-cigarette environment. Extra features such as 'Find my Vape' and 'Lock my Vape' add to the list of benefits of the BluVapp.4.  DESIGN PRINCIPLES and  SERVICES OFFERED

<p>WhereverTV is defining a new era in television broadcasting history for subscribers (you). Our proprietary platform delivers US and International channels (the stuff you want to watch) without the need for a credit check, long term contracts, hidden price increases, or waiting all day for someone to install hardware in your home.</p>
<p>We’ve gone out and licensed (yes, we legally have the rights to broadcast) some of your favorite US television channels and are now busy planning our May 2013 launch. We will be launching with at least 100 US-based television and audio channels, including some names you are very, very familiar with.</p>
<p>And along the way, we found something else quite interesting – there is a lot of content that you want to watch from the comfort of your living room, but many content owners have been hampered by the traditional way of broadcasting directly to television sets inside the USA, let alone the rest of the world.</p>
<p>WhereverTV has solved that problem by developing a television viewing platform that can be used easily by subscribers (you) and content owners (the stuff you want to watch). While designing WhereverTV, we focused on creating a simple on-screen channel guide that is fully customizable by the subscriber (yeah, that’s you, too).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Television on your terms</strong></h2>
<p>12 and 24 month contracts? Not here. Power to the people!</p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<p>Q. What channels will be part of the US Service?</p>
<p>A. We will be making official announcements closer to launch but we can assure you that these are channels that you, your family, and friends are familiar with and will enjoy.</p>
<p>+ + + </p>
<p>Q. Do you have the rights to broadcast these channels or are you taking “free channels” from an antenna and recording them?</p>
<p>A. No, unlike other companies who have decided to broadcast first and license second, WhereverTV is doing it the right way. We are negotiating with each network, getting their approval, and signing a contract before we can turn on each channel.</p>
<p>+ + +</p>
<p>Q. How much bandwidth does WhereverTV consume?</p>
<p>A. International channels are broadcast at 800kbps. US channels are broadcast at 1.1.Mbps.</p>
<p>+ + +</p>
<p>Q. What kind of connection do I need to watch WhereverTV?</p>
<p>A. A broadband connection of at least 3Mbps is the suggested minimum speed to receive encrypted signals from WhereverTV’s proprietary platform.</p>
<p>+ + +</p>
<p>Q. Do you offer channels in HD?</p>
<p>A. No. Currently, all of our channels are broadcast in standard definition. Due to bandwidth caps in place today by most ISPs, you would only be able to watch a few hours of HD programming, which requires ~5Mbps, or pay excessive “overage fees”. To see WhereverTV’s CEO discussing this exact issue at a FCC hearing, please visit:<a href=""http://bit.ly/W5NBvC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bit.ly/W5NBvC</a>. As our delivery infrastructure and data compression technologies continue to evolve, we do expect live streaming television in HD will be available in the future.</p>
<p>+ + +</p>
<p>Q. How much does a set top box cost?</p>
<p>A. Most of the boxes that support WhereverTV cost $99.</p>
<p>+ + +</p>
<p>Q. What set top boxes work with WhereverTV?</p>
<p>A. The new &amp; improved WhereverTV Receiver (available at launch), the Vizio Co-Star, Netgear NEO Prime, Boxee Box, and Apple TV (via Airplay with a compatible iPhone or iPad).</p>

<p>A. Yes, for International content. No, for US content.</p>
<p>+ + +</p>
<p>Q. Can I watch WhereverTV on a smartphone or an iPad?</p>
<p>A. Yes, for international content. No, for US content, today. However, we do expect this feature to be available in the future and can turn it on within minutes, once we have the necessary broadcast rights. There are already a few US channels (and many international channels) who have given us the rights to deliver their content to any mobile device.</p>
<p>+ + +</p>
<p>Q. Is a 12 or 24 month contract required?</p>
<p>A. No. All of our services are month to month. However, we do offer discounts for prepaid 6 or 12 month packages.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 class=""dotty"">Risks and challenges </h2>
<p>The risks and challenges related to completing our project are related to both internal and external obstacles.</p>
<p>Internally, we develop and deploy software onto a variety of devices, so making sure our code is properly tested, debugged, and optimized prior to launch is critical. Since we have been developing software as a company for more than 5 years now, we have the necessary processes and contingency plans in place to handle any unforeseen issues that may arise.</p>
<p>Externally, we face a very rapidly changing landscape that includes Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and content owners. We cannot guarantee that every platform we intend to launch on will allow us to - mainly because each OEMs corporate goals and objectives might be in conflict with what we are trying to achieve as a company. Or maybe because an OEM signed a agreement with another company that prohibits distribution of our content on their platform. That is why we are platform agnostic. We have been approved on a number of platforms and will continue to add support for new platforms as they become available to the general public.</p>
<p>From a content licensing perspective, we have been working on obtaining necessary distribution rights for more than 3 years now and have learned a great deal over that time. We believe even if we do not reach terms with another content owner between now and the time we launch, we have sufficient content already aggregated to release an exciting and valuable product to our customers. However, we are confident that our content acquisition strategy will continue to pay dividends and expect even more high-profile content owners to join our channel line-up between now and our anticipated launch.</p></div>","Wherever you are….WhereverTV.
WhereverTV is defining a new era in television broadcasting history for subscribers (you). Our proprietary platform delivers US and International channels (the stuff you want to watch) without the need for a credit check, long term contracts, hidden price increases, or waiting all day for someone to install hardware in your home.
We’ve gone out and licensed (yes, we legally have the rights to broadcast) some of your favorite US television channels and are now busy planning our May 2013 launch. We will be launching with at least 100 US-based television and audio channels, including some names you are very, very familiar with.
And along the way, we found something else quite interesting – there is a lot of content that you want to watch from the comfort of your living room, but many content owners have been hampered by the traditional way of broadcasting directly to television sets inside the USA, let alone the rest of the world.
WhereverTV has solved that problem by developing a television viewing platform that can be used easily by subscribers (you) and content owners (the stuff you want to watch). While designing WhereverTV, we focused on creating a simple on-screen channel guide that is fully customizable by the subscriber (yeah, that’s you, too).
 
Television on your terms
12 and 24 month contracts? Not here. Power to the people!
Credit checks? Why, didn’t your credit card company already do that?
Hardware that is impossible to install without a certified company technician? What is this, 1999?
Calling off work and waiting all day for someone to arrive to complete your order? We know how disappointed you are that you won’t have to do that here. You’ll just have to use that extra vacation day to actually, hmmm….oh yeah, VACATION.

<strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (Dec 12, 2014)</strong>
<p></p><h3>Three Time Purple Heart Recipient Launches Crowdfunding Campaign
for Video on Demand Service to Overseas U.S. Military.</h3>
<i>Frederick A. Taylor, Jr., former National Commander of the Military Order of the Purple Heart and Chairman of the nonprofit organization, MOPS Networks, has launched an Indiegogo campaign to raise money for their organization's ""Freedom Stream"" initiative.</i> - <a href=""https://www.mopsnet.org/news/pr-crowdfunding-launch/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">View Full Press Release</a><p></p>
<h3>Why Freedom Stream?</h3>
<p>So many Americans support our men and women in uniform. What most Americans are not aware of is that when our brave men and women deploy overseas to defend your rights and freedoms, they surrender one of their most basic rights. The same news, sports and entertainment that you watch from the comfort of our home is blocked to them from viewing overseas.</p><p>At any given time, its estimated that over 800,000 U.S. soldiers and civilians are stationed overseas on behalf of the U.S. Government and Department of Defense. Maintaining an everyday connection with our U.S. Homeland is important in helping maintain morale and quality of life for these people. Access to television programming, just like that at home, is an important way to maintain this connection. MOPS Networks is a 501(c)(3) Non Profit Organization that provides Freedom Stream - a Video on Demand service dedicated to delivering U.S. broadcasts and cable television programming to our fellow citizens serving overseas in support of our National defense.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1059415/files/20141130212602-soldier1.png?1417411562"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<h3>What are we wanting to raise?</h3>
<p>We would like to raise $1 million towards providing 300,000+ U.S. service members and their families stationed overseas with free online access to high definition, premium Video on Demand and Live IPTV broadcasts. It will also go towards providing access to the 500,000+ U.S. civilians and their families living overseas in support of our troops. Our fundraising campaign is not 'all or nothing'.</p><p>Our campaign is setup for ""flexible funding"", so everything we raise, even if we don't reach our goal, will still go towards purchasing great content. As a non-profit, much of our content we can purchase at little to no cost through tax deductions to, and the generosity of, content owners, broadcast networks and distributors. So please, contribute what you can. The Video on Demand site is already complete, and will go online regardless of whether we reach our goal here or not in early 2015.  </p>
<h3>What is your donation used for?</h3>
<p>We will use your donation to acquire content and help bring FreedomStream.TV online. We have already built out our development site at <a href=""http://www.freedomstream.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.freedomstream.tv</a>, and your support will help MOPS Networks' take the Freedom Stream initiative from development to full operations. With our friends at iStreamPlanet, the folks that brought the entire world the 2014 Sochi Olympics, we are preparing to bring IPTV live streaming online to FreedomStream.TV in early 2015.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1059408/files/20141130212333-content-white.png?1417411413"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p>Your donations, our low administrative costs, non-profit discounts offered by many of our vendors, and the help of our volunteers (thank you vendors and volunteers!), enable us to provide a full month of streamed programming to our troops overseas for free.</p>
<p>In January, MOPS Networks will be attending the National Association of Television Producers and Executives (NATPE) conference in Miami to secure content agreements with major content and broadcast companies.</p>
<p>As a non-commercial, non-profit organization providing content strictly to overseas service members, we are uniquely able to secure most content at little or no cost, while providing those owning the intellectual property rights on that content with a tax deduction at the same time. Your support will provide our troops overseas with a vast library of prime time programming.</p>

<h3>MOPS Networks was founded by an amazing team of dedicated patriots and professionals.</h3>
<p>
<strong>Chairman of the Board:</strong> Frederick A. Taylor Jr. has spent his life in service to wounded and disabled veterans. With over 25 years as a director and board member for some of the largest, most influential and supportive non-profit organizations, Fred brings with him a wealth of experience. Wounded 3 times in combat, Fred is one of only 3 surviving Vietnam veterans with 3 Purple Hearts to his name. Along with nearly 20 other awards for valor and service, Fred is a former national commander for the Military Order of the Purple Heart. He has helped to raise millions of dollars over the last 15 years serving on the board of directors with the Purple Heart Foundation Services in support of veterans. He is a true hero and we are blessed to have Fred at the helm!
<br/><br/>
<strong>Executive Director, Co-Founder:</strong> Patrick Bergy, was the 3rd 40 year old to successfully complete basic training at Fort Benning. He has spent nearly 7 years in service overseas, both as an enlisted soldier in the Army, as well as a strategic civilian asset in support of the Department of Defense. With nearly 20 years’ experience in the IT field, he saw the need for fixing the problem with our overseas military being denied access to U.S. broadcasts, and with his knowledge in computers, he knew how to fix it.
<br/><br/>
<strong>President:</strong> Javier Ed Benavente is one of those guys that is literally a rocket scientist. For nearly 30 years, Ed has supported space and launch systems engineering programs and missions for NASA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and National Security Agencies. His work in simulation, visualization, and virtual reality environments for NASA programs led to work supporting commercial film and digital media projects. He served as President of Dynacs Digital Studios, which produced color enhanced versions of black and white film classics, such as “The Nutty Professor”, and digital effects for feature films and broadcast television commercials. Besides his continued consulting work in the U.S. Space and Defense, industries, Ed is currently launching a digital film effects initiative using cloud-based technologies.

Three Time Purple Heart Recipient Launches Crowdfunding Campaign
for Video on Demand Service to Overseas U.S. Military.
Frederick A. Taylor, Jr., former National Commander of the Military Order of the Purple Heart and Chairman of the nonprofit organization, MOPS Networks, has launched an Indiegogo campaign to raise money for their organization's ""Freedom Stream"" initiative. - View Full Press Release
Why Freedom Stream?
So many Americans support our men and women in uniform. What most Americans are not aware of is that when our brave men and women deploy overseas to defend your rights and freedoms, they surrender one of their most basic rights. The same news, sports and entertainment that you watch from the comfort of our home is blocked to them from viewing overseas.At any given time, its estimated that over 800,000 U.S. soldiers and civilians are stationed overseas on behalf of the U.S. Government and Department of Defense. Maintaining an everyday connection with our U.S. Homeland is important in helping maintain morale and quality of life for these people. Access to television programming, just like that at home, is an important way to maintain this connection. MOPS Networks is a 501(c)(3) Non Profit Organization that provides Freedom Stream - a Video on Demand service dedicated to delivering U.S. broadcasts and cable television programming to our fellow citizens serving overseas in support of our National defense.

What are we wanting to raise?
We would like to raise $1 million towards providing 300,000+ U.S. service members and their families stationed overseas with free online access to high definition, premium Video on Demand and Live IPTV broadcasts. It will also go towards providing access to the 500,000+ U.S. civilians and their families living overseas in support of our troops. Our fundraising campaign is not 'all or nothing'.Our campaign is setup for ""flexible funding"", so everything we raise, even if we don't reach our goal, will still go towards purchasing great content. As a non-profit, much of our content we can purchase at little to no cost through tax deductions to, and the generosity of, content owners, broadcast networks and distributors. So please, contribute what you can. The Video on Demand site is already complete, and will go online regardless of whether we reach our goal here or not in early 2015.  
What is your donation used for?
We will use your donation to acquire content and help bring FreedomStream.TV online. We have already built out our development site at www.freedomstream.tv, and your support will help MOPS Networks' take the Freedom Stream initiative from development to full operations. With our friends at iStreamPlanet, the folks that brought the entire world the 2014 Sochi Olympics, we are preparing to bring IPTV live streaming online to FreedomStream.TV in early 2015.
 Your donations, our low administrative costs, non-profit discounts offered by many of our vendors, and the help of our volunteers (thank you vendors and volunteers!), enable us to provide a full month of streamed programming to our troops overseas for free.
In January, MOPS Networks will be attending the National Association of Television Producers and Executives (NATPE) conference in Miami to secure content agreements with major content and broadcast companies.
As a non-commercial, non-profit organization providing content strictly to overseas service members, we are uniquely able to secure most content at little or no cost, while providing those owning the intellectual property rights on that content with a tax deduction at the same time. Your support will provide our troops overseas with a vast library of prime time programming.

About Us
Our mission is simple: to provide video on demand of U.S. broadcasts and IPTV live streaming of special events, free of charge to all overseas uniformed U.S. service members and family. Our services will also be provided to U.S. civilians and their families living overseas in support of our troops under the authority of the U.S. Government. MOPS Networks, Inc. is dully recognized by the IRS and state of Florida as a registered 501(c)(3) Non Profit Organization.

MOPS Networks was founded by an amazing team of dedicated patriots and professionals.

Chairman of the Board: Frederick A. Taylor Jr. has spent his life in service to wounded and disabled veterans. With over 25 years as a director and board member for some of the largest, most influential and supportive non-profit organizations, Fred brings with him a wealth of experience. Wounded 3 times in combat, Fred is one of only 3 surviving Vietnam veterans with 3 Purple Hearts to his name. Along with nearly 20 other awards for valor and service, Fred is a former national commander for the Military Order of the Purple Heart. He has helped to raise millions of dollars over the last 15 years serving on the board of directors with the Purple Heart Foundation Services in support of veterans. He is a true hero and we are blessed to have Fred at the helm!

Executive Director, Co-Founder: Patrick Bergy, was the 3rd 40 year old to successfully complete basic training at Fort Benning. He has spent nearly 7 years in service overseas, both as an enlisted soldier in the Army, as well as a strategic civilian asset in support of the Department of Defense. With nearly 20 years’ experience in the IT field, he saw the need for fixing the problem with our overseas military being denied access to U.S. broadcasts, and with his knowledge in computers, he knew how to fix it.

President: Javier Ed Benavente is one of those guys that is literally a rocket scientist. For nearly 30 years, Ed has supported space and launch systems engineering programs and missions for NASA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and National Security Agencies. His work in simulation, visualization, and virtual reality environments for NASA programs led to work supporting commercial film and digital media projects. He served as President of Dynacs Digital Studios, which produced color enhanced versions of black and white film classics, such as “The Nutty Professor”, and digital effects for feature films and broadcast television commercials. Besides his continued consulting work in the U.S. Space and Defense, industries, Ed is currently launching a digital film effects initiative using cloud-based technologies.

Director of Technology, Co-Founder Justin Losh, has spent 3 years in Iraq providing IT support for coalition and Iraqi forces. His background in development and design has provided the foundation for the Freedom Stream infrastructure. At only 25, Justin has seen more and done more than most men twice his age.

<p>Let's face it: these days we're pretty bogged down by all the chargers we have to lug around with us to keep our technology juiced up and running. Then, the new generation of MacBooks introduced an entirely new port type and brought USB-C dongles into the mix! What's more, with the new MacBook Pro's short battery life, you always have to carry a charger around anyway. So we thought, why not create a <i>better </i>charger that can solve all of these problems in one?</p>

<h3><b>Why Should You Help?</b></h3>
<p>I know being a nerd is an essential
part of my life, as I am sure it is in yours. That’s why Nerd Out is important.
This app is all about you! Nerd Out will not only help you discover and keep
track of events, it'll help you connect and make friends with fellow nerds. The
Nerd world is always growing. With all the new and interesting events out there
it's hard to keep track!<b> I need your help to fund this!</b></p>
<h3><b>Why is There a Need for This App?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Have you ever tried to find information on nerdy events? I'm sure you have. There's bits and bobs scattered everywhere (ie. Facebook, websites, twitter). But nothing centrally located. From the extensive research I've done,
there is no other app or website like Nerd Out. This will be a one of a kind
tool for you to use globally. It will also be available as a FREE app! Yep, that's right
<u>FREE!</u></p>
<h3><b>Do You Have an Event?</b></h3>
<p>Submitting your event to the app is
free! Submissions will be taken by email until the app is completed. Events
must be public events (ie. not your grandmother's birthday party) and be nerd
related (ie. Pop culture related, comic books, TV shows, films, etc.)  </p><p><a href=""nerdoutapp@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">nerdoutapp@gmail.com</a></p><p></p><h3><b>Nerd Out Cares About Your Security!</b></h3><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Did you know we have safety features build into Nerd Out? With our app there will be the ability to share your schedule with your friends. This will work by the use of codes generated by the app. If I want to share my schedule with a friend, all I have to do is select the 'add friend' option and the app will generate a code for you.

<h3><b>Where is the Money Going?</b></h3>
<p>The money will be used to create a
beta version of the app. Funds raised will be used to pay the developers coding
the app. Once a beta version is up and running, the money generated from ad
revenue (ads will be placed at the bottom of the app) will be used for further versions of
the app. All ads featured will be nerd related. Some of the money raised is
allotted for perks such as t-shirts and other nerd-tastic souvenirs. </p><h3>Would You Like to Advertise on Nerd Out?</h3><div>Ads will be placed at the bottom of the app. All ads featured must be nerd related. Make sure to check out the Clone Club and Bruce Wayne Perks for deals on ad space! They are one time only deals for the campaign. First come first served.<br/>
</div>
<h3><b>Why 10k?</b></h3>
<p>Why has the goal changed? I'm going with another company that has worked out a better deal. It's smaller company that I'm going to work one on one with. I will also now be doing some of the coding myself as I've had friends that reached out to help show me how. </p><p><strike>I've spoken to seasoned app
developers about Nerd Out and they estimate it will take $25-27k. This includes the development, design, and marketing costs.The other $3k

<h3><b>What Happens After the App is Funded?</b></h3>
<p>I'll get to work with the developers
building the app. It will take a few months for it to be developed, coded,
and tested. I hope to have it by late fall or early winter. The beta version
will be iPhone only, with android to follow. The reasoning is because iPhone
apps are less expensive to code. Supporters will be invited to participate in
the development process through a series of feedback surveys and
questionnaires. As a supporter, your input will help to shape the development
of the product after this campaign finishes. So you, as a supporter, can
influence the Nerd Out experience. <b>I'll also begin to take submissions for
events at this time as well.</b></p>

cosplayer, and, most importantly, a nerd. I am also the creator of this new

and tracking all the dates for different events, and it hit me! What I needed
was a one-stop shop to help me keep organized, and Nerd Out was born! <b>*BOOM*</b></p>
<p>My first love is and will always be Disney;
I'm a Disney dork! My first official fandom was Buffy, though to be honest, in

At Make It Private, we've developed the most secure online communication tool ever invented. We use tokenization – the same core technology that banks use to protect your credit cards online – but adapted for two-way and multi-party communication in the cloud. 
Three simple steps:
   1. Right-click any message or field in Facebook, Gmail, or other websites. 
   2. Select Make It Private. 
   3. Relax. 
Only your authorized readers will have access to your sensitive data.
We don’t collect or track your personal information. If anyone comes asking about you, we’ll have nothing to offer but randomized bits of data.
The less we know about you, the better we can serve you.

Our Campaign: we've been developing this patented product for more than two years. In the past six months, the stakes have been raised. Businesses violate your privacy every day because collecting, using and sharing your information is a justifiable way to make more money. And as Edward Snowden has shown, government agencies like the NSA routinely cross the line with their data collection practices.
At Make It Private, we've stepped up the urgency of bringing our revolutionary product to market. We've decided to release it to consumers, rather than exclusively to companies or agencies, as a way to level the playing field. We're on track to release a fully tested beta version to you in December.
We're conducting this campaign for three reasons: (1) to give you the chance to be an early user; (2) to raise awareness and grass roots support in the event that we encounter opposition; and (3) to finance our final testing and put us on a firmer financial footing so that we're prepared for any contingency when we launch.

<h1></h1>
<p>Welcome to our CleO project. Our mission (<i> should you accept it </i>)  is to create a family of smart TFT display controllers that can be easily programmed by almost anyone to give professional looking HMI / GUI's <i>with no prior knowledge of complex graphics programming or mathematics</i>. Mission impossible?<i> No, we don't think so...</i></p>
<p>With extensive tutorials ( 20 Chapters covering over 80 topics ) + 20 DIY projects included to show you how, CleO35 ( the 3.5in display version ) allows both hobbyists and professionals alike to add a HVGA ( 320x480 pixel ) resistive touch TFT display GUI to their Arduino UNO projects. We are delighted to offer our backers a very special price of  US$49 (+ US$10 postage )  - around 25% discount on the retail price and similar discounts on the accessories.</p>
<p><b>After meeting and exceeding our target funding we are pleased to announce that the following extra incentives have been awarded as a result -</b></p>
<p><b>1. A free 8GB micro SD card pre-loaded with tutorials and utilities now included with every CleO for our campaign backers.</b></p>
<p><b>2. A free resistive stylus pen for all - you know you'll need it!</b></p>
<p><b>3. We've upgraded the Camera sensor from a 2M pixel unit to a 5M pixel unit at no extra charge to our backers who have included one in their Perks selection.</b></p>
<p><b>Please see our updates for more details...</b></p>
<h3>Why Arduino?</h3>
<p>Well, it's fine developing a great display solution, but in real life you often need to connect the display to the outside world with sensors, switches, communications etc. Arduino is a great choice to <i>bridge </i>a display as there is a huge amount of peripherals ( shields in Arduino parlance ), tutorials and help already available for that platform. so, why re-invent the wheel? If you combine it with a FCC/CE certified UNO or compatible ( like our NerO for example ) well there is no reason it cannot be used for commercial projects as well as hobbyist ( Maker ) projects or **both**. One advantage of NerO over UNO is that NerO has an efficient on-board switcher PSU which can deliver 5V at &gt;1A current, great for when you are using the onboard audio and camera as well as the display. NerO can be supplied with <i>long</i> pins ( like an Arduino Shield ) so that CleO sits <i>underneath</i> NerO leaving the Shield IO connectors free for further expansion. Take a look at the photo below.</p>
<h3><b>Why UNO?</b></h3>
<p>Easy choice actually, <i>most common Arduino Shields today are UNO (5V ) compatible</i>. Some alternatives offer greater computing power but at the expense of backward compatibility or are restricted to 3V Shields only. We offload most of the extreme computational tasks, not only GUI but file system, camera, sound etc to the 310 DMIPs FT903 MCU , so the firmware footprint on the UNO is low, leaving it free to do what it is best suited for.</p>

<h3>After Indiegogo - what happens next ?<br/>
</h3>
<p>After shipping the Indiegogo perks, we plan to move the product into retail ( at a different price of course ), so yes it will be available post-Indiegogo as well. <br/>We are planning to add more tutorials and fun projects over the coming year ( and beyond ) so your early investment in CleO is well worthwhile. There may be some firmware upgrades required to update CleO to the latest capabilities but they will be backward compatible with earlier releases and easy to upgrade via our USB DFU ( Device Firmware Upgrade ) port. Further tutorials, projects, utilities and firmware upgrades will all be downloadable from our dedicated CleO site.</p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are a well known technology company with a good reputation to uphold. We are very experienced with product design, we've built and thoroughly tested the prototype so we are confident in the design. The development and tooling costs are paid for, the funding required is purely to cover the costs of the production runs. We've chosen a top quality manufacturer who has successfully delivered on other crowdfunded projects such as FlowPaw and with whom we work very closely, so we do not anticipate any production issues. The components we use are readily available in bulk so we don't anticipate any supply issues. In summary, we believe the risk in backing this project is extremely low.</p>
<p>There is a huge amount of ( Arduino ) software and ( FT903 ) firmware development required  to provide the projects and tutorials required for this project and it's an ongoing task. However, software updates can easily be provided over the internet and the firmware can easily be upgraded over the USB DFU interface using the supplied utility software.</p>

Welcome to our CleO project. Our mission ( should you accept it )  is to create a family of smart TFT display controllers that can be easily programmed by almost anyone to give professional looking HMI / GUI's with no prior knowledge of complex graphics programming or mathematics. Mission impossible? No, we don't think so...
With extensive tutorials ( 20 Chapters covering over 80 topics ) + 20 DIY projects included to show you how, CleO35 ( the 3.5in display version ) allows both hobbyists and professionals alike to add a HVGA ( 320x480 pixel ) resistive touch TFT display GUI to their Arduino UNO projects. We are delighted to offer our backers a very special price of  US$49 (+ US$10 postage )  - around 25% discount on the retail price and similar discounts on the accessories.
After meeting and exceeding our target funding we are pleased to announce that the following extra incentives have been awarded as a result -
1. A free 8GB micro SD card pre-loaded with tutorials and utilities now included with every CleO for our campaign backers.
2. A free resistive stylus pen for all - you know you'll need it!
3. We've upgraded the Camera sensor from a 2M pixel unit to a 5M pixel unit at no extra charge to our backers who have included one in their Perks selection.
Please see our updates for more details...
Why Arduino?
Well, it's fine developing a great display solution, but in real life you often need to connect the display to the outside world with sensors, switches, communications etc. Arduino is a great choice to bridge a display as there is a huge amount of peripherals ( shields in Arduino parlance ), tutorials and help already available for that platform. so, why re-invent the wheel? If you combine it with a FCC/CE certified UNO or compatible ( like our NerO for example ) well there is no reason it cannot be used for commercial projects as well as hobbyist ( Maker ) projects or **both**. One advantage of NerO over UNO is that NerO has an efficient on-board switcher PSU which can deliver 5V at >1A current, great for when you are using the onboard audio and camera as well as the display. NerO can be supplied with long pins ( like an Arduino Shield ) so that CleO sits underneath NerO leaving the Shield IO connectors free for further expansion. Take a look at the photo below.
Why UNO?
Easy choice actually, most common Arduino Shields today are UNO (5V ) compatible. Some alternatives offer greater computing power but at the expense of backward compatibility or are restricted to 3V Shields only. We offload most of the extreme computational tasks, not only GUI but file system, camera, sound etc to the 310 DMIPs FT903 MCU , so the firmware footprint on the UNO is low, leaving it free to do what it is best suited for.
What's Special?

Anti-Aliased graphics throughout for much finer image quality with no ""jaggies"".
Smooth animations at up to 60 frames/second.
Portrait and Landscape modes supported
Inbuilt PWM Audio and speaker amplifier.
File system supports up to 8 simultaneous file operations.

After Indiegogo - what happens next ?

After shipping the Indiegogo perks, we plan to move the product into retail ( at a different price of course ), so yes it will be available post-Indiegogo as well. We are planning to add more tutorials and fun projects over the coming year ( and beyond ) so your early investment in CleO is well worthwhile. There may be some firmware upgrades required to update CleO to the latest capabilities but they will be backward compatible with earlier releases and easy to upgrade via our USB DFU ( Device Firmware Upgrade ) port. Further tutorials, projects, utilities and firmware upgrades will all be downloadable from our dedicated CleO site.
Risks and Challenges

We are a well known technology company with a good reputation to uphold. We are very experienced with product design, we've built and thoroughly tested the prototype so we are confident in the design. The development and tooling costs are paid for, the funding required is purely to cover the costs of the production runs. We've chosen a top quality manufacturer who has successfully delivered on other crowdfunded projects such as FlowPaw and with whom we work very closely, so we do not anticipate any production issues. The components we use are readily available in bulk so we don't anticipate any supply issues. In summary, we believe the risk in backing this project is extremely low.
There is a huge amount of ( Arduino ) software and ( FT903 ) firmware development required  to provide the projects and tutorials required for this project and it's an ongoing task. However, software updates can easily be provided over the internet and the firmware can easily be upgraded over the USB DFU interface using the supplied utility software.",28.0,1,"1 Campaign

<b>Product </b>Description</h3><p></p><p><b>Dolry – 30-pin adapter compatible with AirPlay,
DLNA, Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi Direct</b></p>
<p>Transform your 30-pin
dock speaker into a wireless HiFi System with the Dolry 30-pin adapter,
compatible with AirPlay, DLNA and Miracast.</p>
<p>Dolry is a brand new
generation of wireless music receivers – no more pairing issues, low operation
range, poor sound quality or limited compatibility with the most popular music
docks – both digital and analog.</p>
<p>Dolry is a small
gadget, not wider than an iPhone, that you connect to the 30-pin connector of
your HiFi Stereo. Once connected, Dolry sets up an WiFi Direct network – no
router needed. Simply connect your f.e. iPhone to this network and stream music
via WiFi in full music quality with AirPlay and an operation range of 30
meters.</p>
<p>You can also connect
Dolry to your home WiFi network router. All devices running on iOS, Android and
Windows connected to the same network will then be able to stream music to the
Dolry unit via AirPlay, DLNA and Miracast while connected to the Internet at
the same time. Steam music from your favorite cloud music vendor, such as
Spotify, or you favorite Internet Radio App.</p>
<p>Dolry also supports
the multi room functionality. This means that you can stream music to several
Dolry units at the same time. Using iTunes on a Mac or PC you can stream to all
your docks simultaneously.</p>
<p>Dolry stream music
with lossless quality unlike competing Bluetooth devices which compress and
thus lower the sound quality up to 3 times. Dolry’s technology also has a much
greater range than Bluetooth. Bluetooth only offers a range of 10 meters, while
Dolry has the range of 30 meters on WiFi Direct and when Dolry is connected to
your home WiFi network, the range expands to the same range that your router
can handle.</p>
<p>After Apple’s removal
of the 30-pin connector from the iPhone 5 and future products, all docking
stations with the 30-pin connector have suddenly become obsolete. The Apple
lightning adapter is one solution, but it is visually unattractive and clumsy
to use. Dolry is designed to solve this problem, and also adds the tremendous
feature to make your HiFi Stereo wireless.</p>
<p>Thanks to Dolry’s WiFi
Direct and WiFi technology, you can both use Dolry in your home, in your car or
at the beach.</p>
<p>Dolry also supports
playback of Internet radio stations, using our iOS and Android App. From the
App, you can choose a list of Internet radio stations. The Dolry unit will then
start streaming music from your chosen station. The streaming is not dependent
on the iOS device, so once playback has started you can leave your home or take
a call without playback interruptions. Dolry will support a wider range of
radio stations soon throughout the world.</p>
<p>Dolry® has been
designed with the premise in mind that sound is all about simplicity, It is
simple and seamless to setup Dolry®.</p>
<p>Just connect Dolry® to
the WiFi network and follow the straightforward instructions on the Dolry®
control App. The process of setup is only necessary the first time – once done
just go ahead and play music from all compatible devices. No more headaches of
pairing your devices as required in Bluetooth devices.</p>
<p>And there is no
cumbersome power supply needed to charge your Dolry®. The device simply uses
the power supply of the docking station.</p>
<p>Download the free
Dolry® Control App. There are a few simple steps to connect Dolry® to your WiFi
network, and choose and manage your settings, all wirelessly. No more messing
about with cables or flicking through complicated manuals.</p>
<p>No 30-pin music Dock?</p>
<p>Don’t have a 30-pin on
your favorite speaker system but still want to enjoy the freedom of wireless
audio streaming?</p>
<p>Simply connect the
optional 30-pin to AUX 3.5mm + USB gold plated cable and use Dolry with any
3.5mm AUX input. Power is supplied via USB and audio delivered through 3.5mm
AUX jack. </p>
<p>THE PURPOSE OF
INDIEGOGO:</p>
<p>What the money is
needed for is to increase production to keep up with demand and also to
increase the cloud player and internet radio capability. Plus we’d like to
educate even more people about the superior technology with this product which
uses AirPlay and DLNA compared to less superior products that work with
Bluetooth technology, by increasing advertising! This all costs plenty of
money, and this too will increase production! One other thing the money would
be used for is to continue to improve the product, the “Dolry Hi-Fi Stone”</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><strong>Will Chargerito work if my device is in a case?</strong></p>
<p>Yes for the vast majority of cases. We built the connectors to stick up enough that Chargerito will not interfere with any cases. We abide by Apple's guidelines so as long as your case does too (most do), it will work with Chargerito.</p>
<p><strong>What types of electrical outlets does Chargerito work with?</strong></p>
<p>Right now it only works with U.S. standard electrical outlest (NEMA 110V AC outlets). Soon we plan to offer the chargerito for other types of electrical outlets found throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>How long does it take Chargerito to charge a device?</strong></p>
<p>In short, about twice as fast as an external battery or USB cable connected to another device like a laptop. It varies significantly according to the device being charged, room temperature, age of the battery, etc., but Chargerito charges as quickly as the leading in-wall chargers out there. It takes about one hour to charge an iPhone 7 from 0 to 100%.</p>
<p><strong>Why does the Apple version have a backstop arm on it?</strong></p>
<p>As part of our MFi (made for iPhone) certification, Apple requires dock accessories like ours to have a backstop to support your iPhone as it charges. Even though there will be a wall supporting your phone in the vast majority of cases, this provides and added level of protection.</p>
<p><strong>How is my device held securely as it charges?</strong></p>
<p>Chargerito fits firmly into the wall outlet and can support a lot of weight. We're so confident in it, we put our own laptop, tablet and phone at stake in this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lixy_Tcfvbc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">demo video</a>. Even something as heavy as an iPad will charge safely on it. That said, if something were to knock into the side of your device forcefully, such as a toddler, cat, or oblivious person, that could knock it off its perch. Chargerito is actually designed to break before your device does, so it's a much less expensive fix.</p>
<p><strong>What are the electrical specifications?</strong></p>
<p>In: 100 - 240VAC 50 - 60Hz 200mA</p>
<p>Out: 5 VDC 1A 7.5W</p>
<p><strong>What certifications does this product have?</strong></p>
<p>Chargerito has several certifications that hold it to high international standards.</p>

<p>We are going to build a Sales and Customer Relationship Management app for small and medium sized businesses. The design of our app allows for product and customer management and can even create an invoice for services or products sold. It will be built to be used on mobile phones and tablets (which are widely available and used in Africa) initially targeted at IOS devices and with time (and funding) we will make the application available on Android too. </p>
<p>The big difference between other apps and our <strong>awesome</strong> app is that we will be building <strong>fun</strong> into the application. We have recognised that there is an ocean full of boring systems and applications available that people hate to use. They are not engaging, they are not fun to use and there is very little reward for using them. In addition we believe that the users should have the opportunity to give feedback easily about those things that work for them, those that don't and make requests for additions to the application so that we continually improve it in the ways that the users actually want.</p>
<p>At this moment we have designed the app, defined the spec and registered the company so all we need now is <strong>your help</strong> to allow us to buy some additional equipment that we can use for building and testing the app as well as to pay the developers for their work. </p>
<p>Important to note: The founders are going to stay poor while this application is being developed. This is not about earning a salary for ourselves at the outset, it is about building and growing app development in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>This app is going to be FUN to use! </p>
<p>Somewhere as we grew up adults forgot that in order to really achieve, we should actually be having <strong>fun</strong>. We should enjoy the work we do, we should enjoy the people we interact with and we should avoid (wherever possible) the dreaded spreadsheet. Getting new deals, generating new sales and onboarding new customers should not only be <strong>easy</strong> but we should be <strong>rewarded</strong> for our success. Immediately.</p>
<p>As we reach targets or goals that we set, the app will award points, when we update our customers details we should get <strong>points</strong> and when we sign new deals, we should get a crown for the day on our <strong>avatar</strong> for everyone to see. Enough points gets you to level up, 'buy' upgrades for your avatar and a whole lot of other fun rewards that we have planned. Having fun for doing the things that we should be doing anyway should be part of our lives and this app is going to get us closer to that.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The simple concept is:</p>
<p>1. Reward people for the right behavior, which will encourage more of the right behavior</p>
<p>2. More of the right behavior creates additional opportunity for growth </p>
<p>3. More opportunities for growth means a greater probability of converting opportunities into sales</p>

<h3>With your help (of course).</h3>
<p>We have the knowledge and the know-how. We have the specifications and the diagrams and we have the technical ability to create the app but we need more developers to get it finished in as short a time as possible. With your help we will be able to bring on board more developers to get this project finished!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twentysixtwentyeight.co.za/images/4.%20Why%20support.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the environment we have in Africa, affordable tools to enable growth are few and far between and we want to change that. We are creating an app that helps people to enjoy the sales and CRM processes and supports their business growth by making the process engaging and easy to use. By building an app that encourages the right behaviors we know we can be part of helping Africans to help themselves.</p>
<p>Supporting this campaign means you are helping small businesses grow which means real impact into our communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twentysixtwentyeight.co.za/images/5.%20Why%20should%20you.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Pure and simple, you will be <strong>helping others to help themselves</strong>. </p>
<p>While we are not arrogant enough to claim that this app will be the driver for an African economic turnaround, we do believe that it will be <strong>part of a change</strong> that needs to happen. In this project, you have an opportunity to be part of that change and know that you are supporting a massively beneficial project.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>You will be able to <strong>download this app from anywhere!</strong> This is not going to be exclusive to African countries though, we want all small businesses to be using this app and will make it available wherever we can! Quite shamelessly in fact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twentysixtwentyeight.co.za/images/6.%20Our%20Vission.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Johannesburg is a wonderful city and is populated by the most fantastic people you can imagine. Warm and friendly and from all over Africa, it is the people that makes the city so special. We do however have a problem that is going to become more and more apparent as the years go by as the gold that is being mined underneath our feet is running out. We are going to have no choice but to grow alternative industries to support and sustain our people. </p>
<p>Apple, Google and Microsoft have been kind enough to show us the way to change our lives by providing us with platforms to create and distribute applications that can be useful to many. Our intention is therefore to create and distribute, to African countries (actually any emerging market), applications that can be used to support businesses.</p>
<p>In developing and growing the mobile application development skills in Johannesburg we can employ people immediately and within a few short months have an application available that can be used in local African markets to grow their own businesses. With time we will improve our application offerings, helping to grow more businesses and at the same time employ and grow our own local application development industry.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that in working for a model that specifically enables growth across the value chain we can fuel the creation of a new sustainable growth path for Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Also, we are going to have the most fun along the way because we should enjoy our lives!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twentysixtwentyeight.co.za/images/8.%20Funding%20goals.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our target for funding is currently set at $50000. This will allow us to purchase additional hardware (servers, computers and additional tablets) to be used by the development team for the creation and testing of the application. Probably most importantly it will allow us to pay the developers for the work that they do. </p>
<p>If we manage to get sufficiently beyond our initial funding goal then we will be making the application available for free to anyone who wants it. Our primary goal is to enable growth and we would hate for a price tag to get in the way of that so if we get beyond $60000, we wouldn’t charge for the core SalesX application we create, it would be FREE to download from the App Store.</p>
<p>If we are able to raise more than $70000 (ambitious, I know), we will purchase 5 iPad mini's, load up the application and get out to the people that count. We will work with the local communities to find 5 worthy businesses that would benefit from the application to load onto SalesX and give them the app and the iPad for free. For every additional $5000 that we raise beyond this, we will add another 5  iPad mini's to the shopping cart and really make a difference where it counts!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twentysixtwentyeight.co.za/images/7.%20Who.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>26:28 is a Johannesburg, South Africa, based company created to develop mobile applications for the corporate and personal markets in Africa. We are driven to not only create tools that can be used to enable business growth but also to grow the technical skills required to develop mobile applications. We believe in the potential of Johannesburg to become a centre for African innovation in mobile application development and are driven to see that become a reality.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.twentysixtwentyeight.co.za/images/26_28_logo%201%20a%20sml.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the same way that the gold of Johannesburg has driven economic growth and development in South Africa for the last (almost) 130 years, mobile application development must be entrenched in the culture of Johannesburg to drive the next wave of growth, not just for Johannesburg but for the African continent. With the explosion of the use of mobile technologies, primarily by individuals for their own personal use, we wish to expand that same pioneering spirit of making every-day life simpler through the entrenchment of application use into the business world. </p>
<p>Given the penetration of smartphones and tablets in South Africa and their increasing use throughout the rest of Africa, there is massive opportunity for the development of business tools by Africans for Africans. Our vision is to provide a platform from promising South Africans to excel and educate Business that outsourcing to other countries is not necessary when the expertise is available here in South Africa.</p>

Apple, Google and Microsoft have been kind enough to show us the way to change our lives by providing us with platforms to create and distribute applications that can be useful to many. Our intention is therefore to create and distribute, to African countries (actually any emerging market), applications that can be used to support businesses.
In developing and growing the mobile application development skills in Johannesburg we can employ people immediately and within a few short months have an application available that can be used in local African markets to grow their own businesses. With time we will improve our application offerings, helping to grow more businesses and at the same time employ and grow our own local application development industry.
We firmly believe that in working for a model that specifically enables growth across the value chain we can fuel the creation of a new sustainable growth path for Johannesburg.
Also, we are going to have the most fun along the way because we should enjoy our lives!
 

Our target for funding is currently set at $50000. This will allow us to purchase additional hardware (servers, computers and additional tablets) to be used by the development team for the creation and testing of the application. Probably most importantly it will allow us to pay the developers for the work that they do. 
If we manage to get sufficiently beyond our initial funding goal then we will be making the application available for free to anyone who wants it. Our primary goal is to enable growth and we would hate for a price tag to get in the way of that so if we get beyond $60000, we wouldn’t charge for the core SalesX application we create, it would be FREE to download from the App Store.
If we are able to raise more than $70000 (ambitious, I know), we will purchase 5 iPad mini's, load up the application and get out to the people that count. We will work with the local communities to find 5 worthy businesses that would benefit from the application to load onto SalesX and give them the app and the iPad for free. For every additional $5000 that we raise beyond this, we will add another 5  iPad mini's to the shopping cart and really make a difference where it counts!
 
 
26:28 is a Johannesburg, South Africa, based company created to develop mobile applications for the corporate and personal markets in Africa. We are driven to not only create tools that can be used to enable business growth but also to grow the technical skills required to develop mobile applications. We believe in the potential of Johannesburg to become a centre for African innovation in mobile application development and are driven to see that become a reality.

In the same way that the gold of Johannesburg has driven economic growth and development in South Africa for the last (almost) 130 years, mobile application development must be entrenched in the culture of Johannesburg to drive the next wave of growth, not just for Johannesburg but for the African continent. With the explosion of the use of mobile technologies, primarily by individuals for their own personal use, we wish to expand that same pioneering spirit of making every-day life simpler through the entrenchment of application use into the business world. 
Given the penetration of smartphones and tablets in South Africa and their increasing use throughout the rest of Africa, there is massive opportunity for the development of business tools by Africans for Africans. Our vision is to provide a platform from promising South Africans to excel and educate Business that outsourcing to other countries is not necessary when the expertise is available here in South Africa.
 

Dawie Botes:
Most importantly, he has awesome hair. With hair like that, you know you have a winner on your hands. With over 10 years’ experience in technology, in various roles spanning Systems Administration, Channel Delivery Ownership and Business Architecture, Dawie incubated the passion for intuitive, simple and value-add applications to customers. The majority of his career was spent in Financial business areas, where he would understand the fundamental requirements a user needs to fulfill their role. Applying financial principles in business allows the mindset of clear integrity in both business practice as well as data. As an avid Gadget enthusiast Dawie is excited about applying his knowledge and skill in building leading edge applications, spanning a wide customer base.
Anthony Poplett:
With different (but no less awesome) hair, Anthony is clearly a winner. How could you not want to support this guy? Seriously though, Anthony has been working with systems development teams within the Financial services sector to build applications on various platforms for the last 12 years. With a focus on delivering solutions he is highly motivated to make SalesX a reality and deliver the app as a solution to an African need for lower cost and portable business solutions.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>CoffeeConnect, or CoCo for short, answers a question that many of us have previously asked ourselves- how do I meet people in this crazy, busy, buzzing town?!</p>
<p> Some of us are new to where we live, others just want to meet new and interesting people.  We know that there are tons of great people right nearby that we could become fast friends with, that can help us in our career or we can hit it off with romantically.  But, and it's a big BUT, we are often too busy, too over-worked or too shy to actually start a conversation.</p>
<p>This is the problem that CoCo aims to solve.  CoCo is a location based mobile application that allows you to see others near you, wherever you happen to be, and connect with them over a coffee, face to face.  It's simple, it's fast and it's approachable. </p>
<p>So whether you are a busy professional who has no time to date, or a student who just moved to the city and looking to make new friends, you now have the tool to see others nearby who also want to meet new people and connect with them over a coffee. Easy. </p>
<p>We purposely don't include the Facebook Connect functionality because we want you to meet new people.  You already know your Facebook friends, now go out and make new ones!</p>
<h2><strong>Why Coffee?</strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong>Coffee has been connecting people for centuries; we are just giving it a little boost with today’s technology.</p>
<p>Coffee is an invitation for conversation, a chance to meet face to face, but is still quick enough to fit into our busy lives.</p>
<p>Coffee is professional, approachable and directs people to meet in public places, taking the 'sleaze factor' that many platforms attract.  We think that 'SexyGuy69' is not likely to use the platform based on its professional direction and of course, the security settings.  </p>
<p>The objective of the platform is for people to meet and form meaningful relationships. </p>
<p>What better way to do so than over a cup of coffee? </p>
<p>CoCo is being released on the iPhone in April 2012.</p>
<h2><strong>Why do we need funding?</strong></h2>
<p>We hope you are excited about CoCo and encourage you to help us raise funds for the expansion onto the Android platform, as well as the implementation of new features that will allow coffee retailers to provide promotions to loyal CoCo users.  It makes perfect sense that cafes should reward CoCo users for choosing their establishments and we want to see offers such as these distributed to CoCo users:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://findrgroup.com/offer.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We've started conversation with local retailers and they are excited to be able to reward CoCo users for choosing their establishments. </p>
<h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2>
<p>We need your help to expand CoCo onto the Android and to enhance the current features and spread the word about CoCo.</p>
<h3>Please share this project with your friends, family, colleagues and anyone else who'd enjoy a coffee and a chat!</h3>
<p>We can all benefit from more relationships in our lives.  After all, ask anyone, anywhere, what makes them happy, and people will always choose people.</p>

 fractal-based algorithm encode files using an extremely complex double-blind cross system of 2048 byte 
(16384 bit). This means the encryption is delivered using a matrix of 2048x2048 cell all factorial raised to 256, representing the highest encoding level 
available on the market. Following chart shows a simplified view of the encryption levels.Home banking systems and credit cards circuits uses a 128 bit encryption. This is enough safe, however it is possible to attack and brake the key.Military levels (RSA and AES) are much more secure, but for us it is not enough, because skilled military people can intercept you.KIUSO

<p>
My name is
Anton, I'm 35. I have an experience in programming C++ since 1996.
I’m an author and developer of the following open source projects:
tsdemuxer, ps3muxer, pshare and luasp.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Since 2011, I
have been developing an extendable DLNA media server for home routers
with multicast IPTV support. The program is distributed by GPL2
license in the original scripts and is included in the official
repository of OpenWRT.</p>

<p>
With a hope to
make the world a better place, using the accumulated knowledge and
taking into consideration the current needs of my program users, for
several months I have been developing a next-generation home media
server - xupnpd2.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Xupnpd2 is a complete cross-platform media server
with the ability to broadcast multicast IPTV into local network, as
well as video, photos and music from the home archive to any a
DLNA-compatible device.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Key features:</p>
<p>
<span><b>1.
The online TV and video playback on the game consoles </b>PlayStation
3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, SmartTV and other DLNA-compatible devices.</span></p>
<p><span><b>2. HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), multicast over UDP or RTP, HTTP and more.</b></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>3. Multiple platforms support: </b>Microsoft
Windows 7/8/10, Mac OS X 10.5.8 or higher (Intel / PPC), different
installation packages of GNU Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
embedded systems based on OpenWRT and DD-WRT.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>4. Low
system requirements.</b>
Software code is written entirely in C++, and there is almost no
dependence on the external libraries. This, in turn, led to a record
small size of the program with high functionality, performance, and
portability.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>5.
Intuitively understandable user interface.</b>
At this time there is no need to search answers on the Internet since
the new version will have an intuitively-understandable,
user-friendly interface, and the preparation for the work will take
only few minutes. The user doesn’t need to have any special
computer skills, all the user needs to do is to relax and enjoy
watching favorite television programs in the original quality.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What is already available</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At this stage,
there is already a working version for Microsoft Windows, GNU
Linux, FreeBSD and OpenWRT with online streaming, and it has the
functionality of a full-rate media server that supports Lua scripts
and the extensions.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I carried on
the testing of Windows, Linux and OpenWRT versions on: the LG TV, PlayStation
3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, media player Iconbit, Windows Media
Player and VLC.</p>
<p>
The process of
implementing in Mac OS X is in progress.</p>
<p>
At this point
the software package for GNU Linux takes only 270K, for Microsoft
Windows - 1.5M, and for OpenWRT - 300K.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>
During the
first month after the project starts the investors will receive early
access to the current version of the program.</p>
<p>
For $ 1 you will receive from me “Thank you very
much for supporting the project.”</p>
<p>
For $ 5 you will receive early access to the
program, an unlimited ability to watch your media files and multicast
IPTV.</p>
<p>
For $ 10 you will receive early access to the
program, and also all official additions that will appear during the
year, including HLS.</p>
<p>
For $ 25 you will receive early access to the
program, and also all official additions that will appear the
following two years, including HLS.</p>
<p>
For $ 50 you will receive early access to all the
existing software packages, all its possible capabilities and you
will receive all official additions for free for the life term.</p>
<p>
For $ 100 you will receive the program with all
the additions for all supported platforms and, if you wish, your name
will be mentioned on the project official web site. Also you will
receive a postcard from Russia with author’s gratitude.</p>
<p>
For $ 250 in addition to the program and its
plugins you will receive: the support in a VIP
forum group and the possibility to
participate in surveys concerning the feature request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
After
collecting all charges, license fees will be reviewed!</p>
<p>
The next
planned stage is the implementation of the support for OMDB for skins
downloading and video titles from home collection, multicast support,
HLS, possibly BitTorrent, SoundCloud, and so on. There will be a
possibility for FTP access to the collection and user-friendly
Web-based interface with a minimal set of settings for a device
control, the possibility to watch video in browser with a help of
HTML5 tools on the compatible devices, including the Nintendo Wii U.
There will be Android and iOS apps to control the watching process,
and also the media -server version for Mac OS X. In the future
prospect, we want to achieve compatibility with the Chromecast and
Apple TV. And this is not the limit, the structure of the program
allows to extend easily its functionality and to add new sources of
media content, and I have a lot more ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
For further
project development there is a need for community financial aid
because many years of personal experience in open source development
projects showed that all the costs are solely on the author’s
shoulders, and the advertisement can’t cover expenses. For this
reason the usability of the product is suffering because everything
has to be done by my own efforts, combining social activities with
the main work, and as a result there is no time even to prepare
documentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Taking into
consideration the growing public interest to the open source version
of the program and the emergence of newer requirements, the project
must exist and it must develop further. For this reason we need your
help, not necessarily material. I am ready to listen to any
suggestions and accept any possible assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
People all
over the world, especially not in very prosperous regions, want to
have access to the information.</p>
<p>
The purpose of
this project is to give people the ability to watch movies and TV in
high quality using network and with no additional cost, using the
equipment they already have. Thanks to xupnpd2 they don’t have to
buy a satellite dish and set-top boxes (Set-Top Box), they are free
to choose any provider the will pay to for the access to the content
or not to pay at all, limiting themselves with the free network
broadcasts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Investors,
depending on the size of the contribution, will receive early access
to the stable build of the program for all supported platforms, as
well as a full access to all functions of the program for the entire
duration of the product support and they will be able to participate
in the project development.</p>
<p>

Help to make
the world better!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>A little bit more about myself and my plans</h3><p></p><p>
</p><p>
I am fond of programming from the early childhood.
I began to study architecture of ZX Spectrum and programming for it
on Basic. I know such programming languages as: C / C++, Lua,
Assembler, Pascal and Java. I have programming experience in C++
since 1996. Professionally I have been developing software since
2001. From about 2003 I’m working with network technologies and
participating in the software development for highly loaded
distributed systems controlled by GNU Linux and FreeBSD.</p>
<p>
The first open source project started in 2009 as a
program for personal use, but I felt sorry for hiding the results of
the work from the world and I decided to share them for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
The current project is xupnpd. I have been working
on it alone since 2011 to the present. It is a home media server with
support for multicast IPTV, and the system of extensions in Lua
language, that is included into official repository of the operating
system for OpenWRT routers.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YomT03aNvro"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>
My program works on most routers, NAS-es, directly
on some SmartTV, the DreamBox satellite receivers, computers running
under GNU Linux and FreeBSD, and even on the Raspberry PI.</p>
<p>
It is compatible with many UPnP / DLNA-compatible
devices, such as: SmartTV of different manufacturers, PlayStation
3/4, Xbox One, smartphones, Microsoft Windows Media Player and
VideoLAN.</p>
<p>
With the help of xupnpd it is possible to playback
directly from your TV or high-definition IPTV game console of your
ISP without turning on your computer or any other content providers
on the nework.</p>
<p>
If you wish you could watch your own video from
home archive or through the use of system extensions you could turn
to online resources such as YouTube, Vimeo, GameTrailers, Giant Bomb,
IVI and Vkontakte.</p>
<p>
With a help of xupnpd it became possible to
discard the lease or purchase of set-top box in order to watch
digital TV at home. The program is written in C++ and the Lua, it
takes up little space, and it is able to work on many Posix systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Taking into consideration the current trends, I
have decided to review the functionality and get rid of the old code.
I also designed xupnpd2 on the basis of the mandatory requirements of
its native version on Microsoft Windows 7/8/10 (without Cygwin), Mac
OS X 10.5.8 or higher (Intel / PPC) , different GNU Linux packages,
FreeBSD and NetBSD and possibly OpenBSD. The embedded systems won’t
be neglected based on OpenWRT and DD-WRT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
In order to improve the performance, almost all of
the program core code was written in C++, the ability to write
custom Lua-scripts was retained, SQLite support appeared and the
possibility to build extensions (filters) in the chain for multistep
conversion of online video was added. Due to these facts the optional
transcoding or another stream modification in real time can appear in
future, and for example, the organization of the home surveillance
video system can appear as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Now xupnpd2 is a complete cross-platform media
server with the ability to broadcast to the local network without
transcoding video, photos and music from your home archive to any
DLNA-compatible device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
At this time, many players’ features were taken
into account and now it supports: rewind, pause, move to any moment
and resume watching on SmartTV, gaming consoles, PlayStation 3,
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
The user manual will appear in different
languages, as well as the FAQ on the program website. Advanced users,
as before, will be able to create their own extensions to tune the
behavior of the program when broadcasting the digital television to
the home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
There is a record small size of the program with
its high functionality, portability, absence of the need for the
program mandatory installation on the computer's hard drive as well
as the absence of a mandatory subscription for investors for the
program usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
After xupnpd2 release it will retain the
possibility of basic functions free use with some restrictions but
unlike its predecessor it will stop being an open source project and
it will become proprietary software.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Previous projects</h3><p>
</p><p><b>
luasp</b> (2011)  is Web programming language with
support of MySQL, CURL and JSON on Lua-based for embedded systems. It
was created for personal needs, with the following publication of
original scripts under the BSD license.</p>

<p>
</p><p><b>
pshare</b> (2010) is the first attempt to develop a
miniature DLNA compatible media server for personal use, which
allowed me to watch the Extreme Sports Channel in high quality on the
Sony PlayStation 3 without having to turn on the computer. Later I
published the original program codes and provided the community with
ready binaries for several models of home WiFi router running under
OpenWRT or DD-WRT. The program was notable for minimal consumption of
resources and worked without any problems on weak D-Link DIR-320.</p>
<p>
The program became a prototype for more functional
open source xupnpd product creation. Distributed by GPL2 license.</p>

support for multicast IPTV, and the system of extensions in Lua
language, that is included into official repository of the operating
system for OpenWRT routers.

My program works on most routers, NAS-es, directly
on some SmartTV, the DreamBox satellite receivers, computers running
under GNU Linux and FreeBSD, and even on the Raspberry PI.

It is compatible with many UPnP / DLNA-compatible
devices, such as: SmartTV of different manufacturers, PlayStation
3/4, Xbox One, smartphones, Microsoft Windows Media Player and
VideoLAN.

With the help of xupnpd it is possible to playback
directly from your TV or high-definition IPTV game console of your
ISP without turning on your computer or any other content providers
on the nework.

If you wish you could watch your own video from
home archive or through the use of system extensions you could turn
to online resources such as YouTube, Vimeo, GameTrailers, Giant Bomb,
IVI and Vkontakte.

With a help of xupnpd it became possible to
discard the lease or purchase of set-top box in order to watch
digital TV at home. The program is written in C++ and the Lua, it
takes up little space, and it is able to work on many Posix systems.


Taking into consideration the current trends, I
have decided to review the functionality and get rid of the old code.
I also designed xupnpd2 on the basis of the mandatory requirements of
its native version on Microsoft Windows 7/8/10 (without Cygwin), Mac
OS X 10.5.8 or higher (Intel / PPC) , different GNU Linux packages,
FreeBSD and NetBSD and possibly OpenBSD. The embedded systems won’t
be neglected based on OpenWRT and DD-WRT.


In order to improve the performance, almost all of
the program core code was written in C++, the ability to write
custom Lua-scripts was retained, SQLite support appeared and the
possibility to build extensions (filters) in the chain for multistep
conversion of online video was added. Due to these facts the optional
transcoding or another stream modification in real time can appear in
future, and for example, the organization of the home surveillance
video system can appear as well.


Now xupnpd2 is a complete cross-platform media
server with the ability to broadcast to the local network without
transcoding video, photos and music from your home archive to any
DLNA-compatible device.


At this time, many players’ features were taken
into account and now it supports: rewind, pause, move to any moment
and resume watching on SmartTV, gaming consoles, PlayStation 3,
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.


The user manual will appear in different
languages, as well as the FAQ on the program website. Advanced users,
as before, will be able to create their own extensions to tune the
behavior of the program when broadcasting the digital television to
the home network.


There is a record small size of the program with
its high functionality, portability, absence of the need for the
program mandatory installation on the computer's hard drive as well
as the absence of a mandatory subscription for investors for the
program usage.


After xupnpd2 release it will retain the
possibility of basic functions free use with some restrictions but
unlike its predecessor it will stop being an open source project and
it will become proprietary software.Previous projects

luasp (2011)  is Web programming language with
support of MySQL, CURL and JSON on Lua-based for embedded systems. It
was created for personal needs, with the following publication of
original scripts under the BSD license.

GitHub: https://github.com/clark15b/luasp


pshare (2010) is the first attempt to develop a
miniature DLNA compatible media server for personal use, which
allowed me to watch the Extreme Sports Channel in high quality on the
Sony PlayStation 3 without having to turn on the computer. Later I
published the original program codes and provided the community with
ready binaries for several models of home WiFi router running under
OpenWRT or DD-WRT. The program was notable for minimal consumption of
resources and worked without any problems on weak D-Link DIR-320.

The program became a prototype for more functional
open source xupnpd product creation. Distributed by GPL2 license.

PS3muxer (2010 - 2011 gg.) is a free program for
MS Windows, Mac OS X and GNU Linux with a lot of downloads. The
program quickly convert MKV video to fit the Sony PlayStation 3
watching format without loss of quality, taking into account the
original features. Also it is very useful if your player or TV set
does not know about the MKV container or DTS sound. License GPL2.

tsdemuxer (2009) is my first open source project
for MS Windows and GNU Linux. The main purpose of this tool is a
quick video conversion from AVCHD camcorders to MKV without losing
quality. MIT License.

<p> <img alt=""John of Avatwist"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/josh-sports-ads-follow-me.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I thought to myself: no big deal it is advertising, but when they started recommending places in my town and surrounding towns I began to wonder  “how do they know that”,  not even knowing for sure who “THEY” are...LOL</p>
<p> <img alt=""People with spy glasses"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Mag-people.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After talking with a few people who understand the web and technology, I realized that it was actually something that I had NO control over.  I was not happy for being such a fool and completely in the dark about how the internet operates. </p>
<p>Bottom line, I decided that I disagreed with this and wanted to figure out what to do to protect my privacy.  I had no idea where to begin, but I knew that if I was this upset, others would be too when they realize how vulnerable their personal information and privacy is in their daily web use.  I asked around and quickly realized that many others share my concerns about our information being saved FOREVER on a server somewhere, with a connection back to us and all of our personal information.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Infographic of internet access without AvaTwist"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/internet-access-without-AvaTwist-full-picture.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I used my contacts and other resources to arrange a few lunches to present to them and about 500 additional people the concept and logic behind AvaTwist; the response was amazing, and as a matter of fact, many of them including several law and accounting firms are working for almost nothing to help get this off the ground.  I figured that is a great start, and proceeded to ask a few talented people whom I am connected with to join me on this venture, and that is how AvaTwist began!  I have pretty good contacts with a vast array of skills, and have been able to accomplish quite a bit with my own money and their expertise.   </p>
<p> <img alt=""Surf Anonymously"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/surf-anonomously.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I had this really cool idea for a name; AvaTwist. This means Avatar with a twist-- Avatar meaning your alter ego, and Twist meaning changing your IP address. I had lawyers trademark three things to help us maintain our tag lines and company name. We trademarked “AvaTwist”, our marketing slogan: “Who do U want to be today"", and our pitch phrase which includes our new word “ForNEVER” (meaning it never happened).</p>
<p> <img alt=""ForNever"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ForNever.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This all happened before the summer, and I was afraid to tell anyone that I didn't know about my idea because I thought someone might steal it. Finally, in August after we built the first version of our website, I realized I have no reason to be afraid. I just need to put it out there. I am a big believer in the power of intention. Anyone not familiar with it; the basic premise is you put yourself out there openly and the things you need will come to you. That is exactly what has happened. I connected with a few people who joined the team and they have given me incredible insight into the technology and a much better understanding of the Internet.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Who Do U want to be today? "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/who-do-you-banner.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We were in the process of getting the website and desktop version of AvaTwist built when we had a discussion about how the world is going wireless and mobile. We determined that in order to cover all our bases we needed to have a mobile App available as soon as possible after our desktop version. That brings us to where we are today. I had known about Indiegogo but again was afraid of telling too many people, but I quickly realized it is a perfect fit for my project, building the App for AvaTwist. I do not mind competition because it just validates our concept even more. Additionally, we are working on other ideas for the future that should keep us ahead of any potential competitors.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Images of iphone App"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/apps-screenshots.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The end result of this tracking is that now I have lost some of my personal freedoms, because now the advertisers bombard me with the information that they think I am interested in. I get the feeling sometimes that my internet surfing becomes one big infomercial for some product a marketer thinks I want. I figured out how to answer my question of “How can I prevent them from knowing who I am AND where I am”. Once I found that answer I came up with the idea for AvaTwist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/avatwist-logo-small-size.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Ok so that is how I started AvaTwist . Now let us talk about what AvaTwist is all about. The Internet used to be a one way communication where we would go to a site and get information, but things have changed big time. Now the sites we visit are now connecting to us and building a profile and SAVING EVERYTHING!!!  To me, being tracked is not something I want or think is very ethical. The two things that I really do not like are when my PERSONAL INFORMATION is sold, and that EVERYTHING IS SAVED FOREVER!! Even if you think you deleted something, it is saved somewhere on the web and tied back to U!! Think of what it will be like in 20 years if we continue giving away all of our information online and our whole life story is there for the WORLD to see.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://avatwist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/eye-who-U-are.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So here are some general things I have learned about the Internet: I learned every Internet connection has a specific IP address that allows your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and anyone else with the right software to know your exact location. They then cross check this information with other records to find out the names of the individuals in the house or the name of the business. There are many other ways we are being tracked on the internet, anytime you put in your email address, every time you click on the “I agree” button or answer a question about your hair color, eye color, street address etc. With this information your service provider or any marketer now knows you and where you surf; and they keep track of it. If that isn't bad enough, here is where it gets scarier, the number of entities that are tracking you by the time you have gone to 4 or 5 different websites is now somewhere between 100 and 150. Then they take all the information that they have gathered from your searching habits and turn around and sell it to anyone who is interested in buying it. Worse, there are companies that combine the information from many marketers to get a better picture of you, which is then sold for more money. This is all LEGAL; never mind the companies and people that are illegally stealing your personal information!!</p>
<p>We have patent pending technology that combines two things we believe no one else has ever done before. We “twist” you, changing your IP address (where you are physically) and then mask the real U using Avatars. This also makes it fun because you can be someone else, and deep down we all want to be someone or something we are not.</p>

<p>You can have as many Avatars as you want.  In early beta testing my friend Brittni uses three Avatars; one for her friends and family to connect with her to share pictures and other things she doesn't want to share with the rest of the WORLD as Brittni.   The second one is for her to be whomever she wants to be and NO ONE knows who she is.   The third one is an Avatar of herself…. Brittni, so she can use Social Media and other types of Online services to stay connected with her business contacts and to reconnect with people from her past. </p>

<p>The big key to our success is ease of use. Our user interface is simple and easy to use, if it was complex like our back-end software, then no one would use it. We have developed a simple two step process to get “Twisted” and choose your “Avatar”. To me, this will be a big difference in how successful we are. We really think there is a need for our product but if it is hard to use people will just continue business as usual.</p>

<h3> </h3></div>","Hi, I am Josh Entner and I am excited to share the story of AvaTwist with you!  A quick background on me is that I am extremely outgoing and will talk, comment, or share on any topic-- no matter how taboo.  I often share my professional experiences and other stories about my life, however, when it comes to my personal information and family, I am VERY private.  Like most people, I use the web all the time for both work and fun.  One day I was looking for some sports stuff and noticed the advertisements were following me everywhere.
 
I thought to myself: no big deal it is advertising, but when they started recommending places in my town and surrounding towns I began to wonder  “how do they know that”,  not even knowing for sure who “THEY” are...LOL
 
After talking with a few people who understand the web and technology, I realized that it was actually something that I had NO control over.  I was not happy for being such a fool and completely in the dark about how the internet operates. 
Bottom line, I decided that I disagreed with this and wanted to figure out what to do to protect my privacy.  I had no idea where to begin, but I knew that if I was this upset, others would be too when they realize how vulnerable their personal information and privacy is in their daily web use.  I asked around and quickly realized that many others share my concerns about our information being saved FOREVER on a server somewhere, with a connection back to us and all of our personal information.
 
I used my contacts and other resources to arrange a few lunches to present to them and about 500 additional people the concept and logic behind AvaTwist; the response was amazing, and as a matter of fact, many of them including several law and accounting firms are working for almost nothing to help get this off the ground.  I figured that is a great start, and proceeded to ask a few talented people whom I am connected with to join me on this venture, and that is how AvaTwist began!  I have pretty good contacts with a vast array of skills, and have been able to accomplish quite a bit with my own money and their expertise.   
 
I had this really cool idea for a name; AvaTwist. This means Avatar with a twist-- Avatar meaning your alter ego, and Twist meaning changing your IP address. I had lawyers trademark three things to help us maintain our tag lines and company name. We trademarked “AvaTwist”, our marketing slogan: “Who do U want to be today"", and our pitch phrase which includes our new word “ForNEVER” (meaning it never happened).
 
This all happened before the summer, and I was afraid to tell anyone that I didn't know about my idea because I thought someone might steal it. Finally, in August after we built the first version of our website, I realized I have no reason to be afraid. I just need to put it out there. I am a big believer in the power of intention. Anyone not familiar with it; the basic premise is you put yourself out there openly and the things you need will come to you. That is exactly what has happened. I connected with a few people who joined the team and they have given me incredible insight into the technology and a much better understanding of the Internet.
 
We were in the process of getting the website and desktop version of AvaTwist built when we had a discussion about how the world is going wireless and mobile. We determined that in order to cover all our bases we needed to have a mobile App available as soon as possible after our desktop version. That brings us to where we are today. I had known about Indiegogo but again was afraid of telling too many people, but I quickly realized it is a perfect fit for my project, building the App for AvaTwist. I do not mind competition because it just validates our concept even more. Additionally, we are working on other ideas for the future that should keep us ahead of any potential competitors.
 
The end result of this tracking is that now I have lost some of my personal freedoms, because now the advertisers bombard me with the information that they think I am interested in. I get the feeling sometimes that my internet surfing becomes one big infomercial for some product a marketer thinks I want. I figured out how to answer my question of “How can I prevent them from knowing who I am AND where I am”. Once I found that answer I came up with the idea for AvaTwist.
 

Ok so that is how I started AvaTwist . Now let us talk about what AvaTwist is all about. The Internet used to be a one way communication where we would go to a site and get information, but things have changed big time. Now the sites we visit are now connecting to us and building a profile and SAVING EVERYTHING!!!  To me, being tracked is not something I want or think is very ethical. The two things that I really do not like are when my PERSONAL INFORMATION is sold, and that EVERYTHING IS SAVED FOREVER!! Even if you think you deleted something, it is saved somewhere on the web and tied back to U!! Think of what it will be like in 20 years if we continue giving away all of our information online and our whole life story is there for the WORLD to see.

So here are some general things I have learned about the Internet: I learned every Internet connection has a specific IP address that allows your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and anyone else with the right software to know your exact location. They then cross check this information with other records to find out the names of the individuals in the house or the name of the business. There are many other ways we are being tracked on the internet, anytime you put in your email address, every time you click on the “I agree” button or answer a question about your hair color, eye color, street address etc. With this information your service provider or any marketer now knows you and where you surf; and they keep track of it. If that isn't bad enough, here is where it gets scarier, the number of entities that are tracking you by the time you have gone to 4 or 5 different websites is now somewhere between 100 and 150. Then they take all the information that they have gathered from your searching habits and turn around and sell it to anyone who is interested in buying it. Worse, there are companies that combine the information from many marketers to get a better picture of you, which is then sold for more money. This is all LEGAL; never mind the companies and people that are illegally stealing your personal information!!
We have patent pending technology that combines two things we believe no one else has ever done before. We “twist” you, changing your IP address (where you are physically) and then mask the real U using Avatars. This also makes it fun because you can be someone else, and deep down we all want to be someone or something we are not.
 
You can have as many Avatars as you want.  In early beta testing my friend Brittni uses three Avatars; one for her friends and family to connect with her to share pictures and other things she doesn't want to share with the rest of the WORLD as Brittni.   The second one is for her to be whomever she wants to be and NO ONE knows who she is.   The third one is an Avatar of herself….

Power banks become the must-have companions you need to carry almost every day, but they are not all made equal. 


 
The Outxe W20 is designed to be the best outdoor power bank for modern travelers. Imagine if you can get IP67 rating 20000mAh portable power, wireless charging, quick charging & recharging, unlimited solar power backup that fit in your pocket or hang on your backpack. 

 
OUTXE is a creative and courageous brand aiming at providing you with specifically designed products for outdoors. With OUTXE, you will have great assistants on the go, and every single moment of your journey during the adventure will be unforgettable. 


 
You always used to be worrying about a running out of battery of your devices, in the outdoors, in the mountains, or even on the planes. With W20 power bank, your worry will be reduced to nothing. The capacity of 20000mAh/74Wh can charge your devices for several times with one recharge and it is also the largest capacity that you can take with your luggage onto a plane. 
 



 
What if all of your devices send out warnings of low battery at the same time? And there is only one output on your power bank? It might drive you mad at shifting the charging of those devices from time to time. But now, you can retreat to a reassuring state of mind with Outxe W20. Two quick charging outputs and one wireless charging pad for wireless charging enabled devices, W20 can charge 3 of your devices in a flash at the same time. 


 
For those, just like you,  who like outdoor activities, waiting means wasting time. But now, you don’t have to wait for a century before your power bank is fully charged. Recharge with both inputs on W20, and the needing time will be minimized down to 6.5 Hrs. 


 
This power bank is designed with IP67, the rating that gives a full range safeguard to the power bank against any water and dust threats. You won’t be stopped by any bad days when exploring outdoors. Being crushproof and dustproof, you can also take it with you in the mountains, in the desert or on the sea, using it as a backup, to take you back home safely.

 
The most obvious feature in our futuristic utopia is that people do not have to fumble with a cable to plug into the phone or other devices anymore. We are not there yet. But now, we have the prototype of such a magic device on our power bank. With a wireless charging pad in the center of the power bank, a simple placing of your devices on it will get them fully powered in the next morning. 

 
There is a solar panel on the backside of W20, acting as an emergency backup once your power bank is running out of battery. Under direct sunlight, the solar panel will charge the power bank automatically. Hold it on your hand or hang it on your backpack, then a trickle of power will flow into it. 


 
W20 is equipped with 3 LED lighting modes including strong, weak and SOS, bring you a  beam of bright light in the darkness when walking in the jungle, camping in the forest, or sailing on the sea. Longer than usual using time of 70 hours keeps your outdoor adventure always going on. 


 
To achieve a best secured capability, we designed it with many protective internal structures, including 3mm 4-corner cushion, over 2.5mm rugged casing, unibody water-tight ring, soft rubber lid with 3-layer groove pattern, 0.7mm foam pad and protective panel under the solar panel. Rugged enough for any outdoor challenge.


 
Camo always stands in the frontier of trend all the time, an everlasting symbol of outdoor activities and adventures. W20 has a Camo appearance to fit your taste in fashion,  a well integration of outdoor experience and fashion spirit.

 
We have prepared all the accessories you need or may need in future in our combo. You do not have to fumble around to get a right one.

There is lacking of an easy and simple way to measure the quality of charging cables and chargers for people.</div><p>In our daily life, USB cables and chargers are playing big role of mobile device charging, therefore their quality is critical for the charging. Low quality charging cables and chargers could cause serious damage on your mobile devices or might even burn down your house. You can easily find tons of images, videos and stories by simply search Google and YouTube with keywords like charging cable burning, charger on fire etc. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459846094/IGG_Burning_h4mibe.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Well, a burning or something on fire is very obvious to us to catch. The question is how can we find it out before it burns? or even before we buy it?</p><p>Furthermore, there are also other important but hidden impacts that most of people wouldn’t know in a easy way such as slow charging, strange behaviors on smart phone when charging, dropping data transfer and so on. The following Tip would give you some ideas about how a low quality charging cable will cause slow charging.</p><p><b><i>Tech Tips:</i></b></p><p><i>Wondering why is your charging so slow? A non-qualified charging cable could have a dramatic voltage drop. For example, if your charging cable's impedance is 500mΩ, which many low quality cables do. It will have 0.5v drop @1A charging current, that means you will only get 4.5v at the phone end when your charger provides 5v for charging. Most of smart phones won't even charge in this case. That explains a lot of charging issues we have.</i></p><p>A Low Quality Cable at Charging</p><p><i>In addition, the charging current is now getting higher and higher due to massive application of smart devices. Many devices are charged at 2A or above such as pads and tablets etc. <b>The quality of charging cable has become critical nowadays.</b> Take the given example above, it will have 1v dropping if you are charging at 2A current which leads to only 4v to the device end. Beside the safety issue you may have, there will be certainly no charging at this low voltage for smart devices.</i></p><p><i>FYI, Check out this USB charging cable review video from YouTube: </i><i>（</i><i>in case if you are not able to watch here, here is the link: <a href=""https://youtu.be/doMHmGatyYc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/doMHmGatyYc</a></i><i>）</i></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FdoMHmGatyYc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdoMHmGatyYc%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FdoMHmGatyYc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div>Unfortunately, like the above video, to evaluate the performance of the charging cable and charger is not really an easy task for most of non-tech people or even sometimes for tech people. It requires not only some electronic knowledge but also needs expensive testing equipment. People find it's very hard to deal with all different kind of massive charging products.<p></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459846574/Jumble_cables_s8o20m.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>QualMeter</b> is the easiest and smart way for you to rule the charging.</p><p><b>QooPow™ qualMeter series</b> was initially made for our own lab demanding as we are developing smart and fast charging products for mobile devices.

We gave Rebecca one of our qualMeter prototypes for testing. By using the qualMeter, she was able to find out this cable was in a bad condition before the wire burns on fire. She then checked rest of her cables and chargers, and was able to eliminate 2 other bad cables and 1 bad charger. The next day, Rebecca went shopping. With a little help from qualMeter she bought 3 good cables in a decent price. The businessman was shocked to see her using qualMeter and even asked her where to get one. Lol~ Rebecca was extremely happy with qualMeter, because she's smarter. </i></p><p>What makes the qualMeter so unique is that it comes along with a simple idea that everyone can measure the quality of random cable/charger in a simple way, an affordable way.

Thanks to our Kickstarter Angels, our project folded up with great applauses. It was fantastic experience and unforgettable! But we never ended up there though. We have been constantly receiving messages from a lot of people showing their interests in qualMeter series, thus, we decided to re launch qualMeter series as Pre-Sale project on Indiegogo In-Demand to serve more of our fans! QooPow™ qualMeter in the News: http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/qoometer-smart-usb-charger-hits-kickstarter-10-02-2016/ http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/1187836018/qoometer-finally-a-smart-usb-cable-charger-tester/ http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/charger-tester http://www.omicrono.com/2016/02/protege-tus-dispositivos-de-cables-usb-baratos-con-este-aparato/ (Spanish) http://www.shenzhenware.com/articles/10614 (Chinese-中文) http://www.eefocus.com/test-measurement/358677/r0 (Chinese-中文)  Introducing the QooPow™ qualMeter series  
 


QooPow™ qualMeter series are revolutionary, smart and cost-efficient DIY devices, which can simply help you to diagnostic and get to know the quality of your USB cables and chargers in a glance without any technical background. 
With a qualMeter product around, you will never need to worry about on getting wrong cables and chargers for your precious smartphone or tablet.
qualMeter series handle wide range of mainstream USB charging cables. It also tests loading capability of the 5v chargers to roughly define their quality.
 

  Why We Make qualMeter products?Our motivation for creating the QooPow™ qualMeter was from the observation that there are too many low quality and compromised charging products in the market, especially 3rd-party charging cables and chargers. There is lacking of an easy and simple way to measure the quality of charging cables and chargers for people.In our daily life, USB cables and chargers are playing big role of mobile device charging, therefore their quality is critical for the charging. Low quality charging cables and chargers could cause serious damage on your mobile devices or might even burn down your house. You can easily find tons of images, videos and stories by simply search Google and YouTube with keywords like charging cable burning, charger on fire etc. Well, a burning or something on fire is very obvious to us to catch. The question is how can we find it out before it burns? or even before we buy it?Furthermore, there are also other important but hidden impacts that most of people wouldn’t know in a easy way such as slow charging, strange behaviors on smart phone when charging, dropping data transfer and so on. The following Tip would give you some ideas about how a low quality charging cable will cause slow charging.Tech Tips:Wondering why is your charging so slow? A non-qualified charging cable could have a dramatic voltage drop. For example, if your charging cable's impedance is 500mΩ, which many low quality cables do. It will have 0.5v drop @1A charging current, that means you will only get 4.5v at the phone end when your charger provides 5v for charging. Most of smart phones won't even charge in this case. That explains a lot of charging issues we have.A Low Quality Cable at ChargingIn addition, the charging current is now getting higher and higher due to massive application of smart devices. Many devices are charged at 2A or above such as pads and tablets etc. The quality of charging cable has become critical nowadays. Take the given example above, it will have 1v dropping if you are charging at 2A current which leads to only 4v to the device end. Beside the safety issue you may have, there will be certainly no charging at this low voltage for smart devices.FYI, Check out this USB charging cable review video from YouTube: （in case if you are not able to watch here, here is the link: https://youtu.be/doMHmGatyYc）Unfortunately, like the above video, to evaluate the performance of the charging cable and charger is not really an easy task for most of non-tech people or even sometimes for tech people. It requires not only some electronic knowledge but also needs expensive testing equipment. People find it's very hard to deal with all different kind of massive charging products. QualMeter is the easiest and smart way for you to rule the charging.QooPow™ qualMeter series was initially made for our own lab demanding as we are developing smart and fast charging products for mobile devices. The purpose of making such tool was based on the situation that we needed to roughly measure the different qualities of the cables/chargers and their impact on our products’ performance. With qualMeter series, we are able to easily category the pile of cables and chargers without complicated reading and analyzing. When some of our friends were showing their great interests in this little device, we started to realize that it could benefit others. That's why we decided to take it to Indiegogo In-Demand project and to share with you.One of our friends, Rebecca, was suspecting on one of her new bought charging cables, which always felt hot when charging. We gave Rebecca one of our qualMeter prototypes for testing. By using the qualMeter, she was able to find out this cable was in a bad condition before the wire burns on fire. She then checked rest of her cables and chargers, and was able to eliminate 2 other bad cables and 1 bad charger. The next day, Rebecca went shopping. With a little help from qualMeter she bought 3 good cables in a decent price. The businessman was shocked to see her using qualMeter and even asked her where to get one. Lol~ Rebecca was extremely happy with qualMeter, because she's smarter. What makes the qualMeter so unique is that it comes along with a simple idea that everyone can measure the quality of random cable/charger in a simple way, an affordable way. It intends to provide an easy and simple solution in a fairly low cost. qualMeter series is designed for non-tech people but can certainly be used by tech-savvies for roughly testing as well. Who would need QooPow™ qualMeter series?If you…
Are unsure about the quality of your USB cable & charger;
Are looking for safe and faster charging; 
Don’t want to be cheated by those unscrupulous businessmen; 
Are tired with poor quality of charging cables and chargers; 
Have ever been in dilemma of choosing right USB cable/charger; 
Are dealing with USB cables/chargers as a business; 
Wanted to have easier and simpler solution to rank the pile of cables/chargers; 
More... The Features of QooPow™ qualMeter seriesDespite that versions vary slightly based on their functionalities, qualMeter is basically made for testing USB charging cables and chargers. It has two major functions:Cable Test Mode - Simply connect both ends of your USB charging cable with qualMeter and plug it into any 5v USB charging port. You can read the LED indicators to have an idea about the quality of your charging cable.Charger Test Mode - Simply plug qualMeter into any 5v USB charging port. You can read the LED indicators to have an idea about the quality of your USB Charger.QualMeter has embedded an ultra low power Micro-Processor, a brain, to provide the ability of being smart. Beside its main Cable Test and Charger Test features, it also comes with the following highlighted features:Cable Shielded Test – A shielded cable usually has better quality. It’s not only good for charging but also a benefit for data transferring.Cable Short Circuit Test - When you plug qualMeter at Cable Test Mode, the red LED indicator will start flashing If your cable is shorted. You should stop using this cable immediately!Reversible USB plug – With the reversible USB plug design, you don’t have to worried about the direction of plugging into a USB charging port.    Plug n Play – qualMeter comes with no switch or any control button. There is no manual operation needed to be done. It works automatically according to the status it detects. How does QooPow™ qualMeter work?qualMeter is designed to provide a simple and straightforward way to test cable and charger without any technical background. That means with qualMeter in hand, everyone is able to distinguish the quality of a cable or a charger.Simply connect the cable you want to test into corresponding ports as following diagramQooPow™ qualMeter has two main testing modes, cable test and charger test. It automatically switches between two modes. Charger Test Mode: Without cable plugged in, Charger test mode is enabled right away when qualMeter has been plugged into an USB power source. The orange charger test indicator lights up and it also confirms the testing current is 1A. You can find out the quality of this charger at 1A output by reading the Quality Indicators on the left. Cable Test Mode: Cable test mode will be enabled when both ends of a cable have been connected with qualMeter. Then plug qualMeter into an USB power source. The blue cable test indicator (the left one) will be turned on. You can find out the quality of this cable by reading the Quality Indicators on the left.  Shielded Indication: At the Cable Test mode, if the blue Shielded Indicator (the right one) lights up, it means this cable is shielded.  Cable Short Circuit Test - is as simple as other functions. Just plug both ends of the cable into qualMeter as usual, then plug qualMeter into any 5v USB port. The red LED indicator will start flashing If your cable is shorted. Otherwise, if the cable is not shorted, the qualMeter will automatically start the Cable Test mode to tell you how good is this cable. That’s it ! :)   How to read the testing results? Unlike regular testing devices, there are no numbers bother to read, no buttons, no extra operations, no calculations and no technical background are needed. All you need to know is just colors, the Green, Yellow and Red, which correspond to Good, Fair(OK) and Bad. That’s it! You see colors; you see the quality of your cable and charger. QooPow™ qualMeter is suitable for wide range of mainstream cables and is compatible with most of major 5v USB chargers.Specifications

The product details may be slightly different over the manufacturing process. Optimization is what it takes and more to lock off highest quality possible. The updates will be regularly sent out to our community.Delivery:Since all the manufacturing will be done in China, the rewards will be sent from China as well. We are aware that there may be issues that are unexpected when it comes to international shipping. Our solution is to set up second backup in logistics to avoid delivery failure. This way the shipping risk will be truly minimized. The issues such as on route delay and other unexpected things may happen that we are willing to do our best to avoid and to help solving them if it happened. However, we are not able to take the responsibility on the import duties you may be charged by the custom.",23.0,6,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>You want to use your office phone hands-free. You could buy an expensive unit that comes with its own headset OR you could use this!</strong></p>
<p><strong>With iConnect - you have way more hands-free choices AND save LOTS of money.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Works with ANY telephone AND ANY Bluetooth or Wired hands-free ear/head-set!<br/></strong></p>
<p>iConnect is an elegant solution to the dilemma 83% of the population of the world has: the convenience of a clear land line but no mobility. iConnect Hands-Free allows you to move away from your phone while receiving great reception up to 60-90 feet. It is as small as a two packs of gum and allows you to use the same headset or bluetooth that you already use for your mobile phone with a push of a button. If you use a landline for better reception at home, it turns it into a mobile unit that allows you to cook, clean or use the computer while on the phone. If you are at a desk that uses a landline, you can avoid the sore neck syndrome and move around the office without losing the quality of the sound. If you are in a hotel room, you can use the hotel's phone and move around the room for longer business and personal calls.</p>
<p>It's cheaper than other products out there that do similar tasks so you will save money and get a better quality of sound than what is on the market presently. If your mobile phone came with a wired ear set you can save even more money by using that!</p>
<p><br/> It works with any conventional telephone even if it’s a modern VoIP (Voice over IP) phone. It can be used with a single or multiple line telephone – the phone just has to have a cord between the base and its handset. The iConnect Hands-Free device connects easily in-line with that cord - anywhere. After plugging it in, the telephone operates normally and turns into a hands-free phone.</p>
<p>It is the size of two packs of gum and uses an internal rechargeable battery 1.5” W x 3” L x 0.75” H without a case or shell</p>

<p><strong>You ask - </strong></p>
<p><strong>What makes this device different than what's out there already??!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) ALL other products that are similar make you buy THEIR Bluetooth ear-set and is 'married' only to that unit they sell. If it fails, you have to buy that unique model's part at an inflated cost. With iC HF, you can use ANY Bluetooth ear-set of ANY style.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/> 2) NO other product gives you the option to use wireless OR wired. In fact, there are very few that have a wired unit that allows you to use YOUR wired headset.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) The closest competitive offerings are anywhere from 5 to 10 times more expensive! iC HF does ALL the same things for up to a 10th the cost. Remember you don't have to buy the ear-set, you already OWN IT!</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) iC HF is truly portable! It is much smaller than the competitive offerings. Easily fits in your pocket and can be used ANYWHERE in the world!</strong></p>

<p><strong>iConnect HF – the Basic info</strong></p>
<p>When you purchased your mobile/cell phone, it came with a wired plug-in ear piece with a microphone in the cord. With iConnect HF, you can use this <em>wired</em> ear-set! Or, you purchased a separate wireless Bluetooth earpiece so you could be hands-free with your mobile phone. With iConnect HF, you can use this <em>wireless</em> ear-set! This device can be used world-wide. Any standard or VoIP telephone can be made hands-free with iConnect utilizing the hands-free device you already own! Using a speaker phone is hands-free but think of a more private conversation using iConnect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where it is now …</strong></p>
<p>It exists as a working prototype that just needs a few tweaks. </p>
<p>I have invested a lot of personal funds already and am just at the point to being able to fully patent and market it. With your help, I can finish the engineering and provide samples to those who have already expressed an interest in marketing it, including major electronic resellers and TV product selling channels.  With your help I can aim for a world-wide market and have my dream of creating an invention that makes life easier for thousands of people around the world. </p>
<p>It has one bug (the wireless Bluetooth works fine; but with the plug-in wired head-set - you can hear the caller, but they can’t hear you). That means it has a fix as the wireless portion works just fine. The other is that the power supply charger portion needs to be updated from Nokia-type to the more ubiquitous mini 1A 5VDC USB type. The 3 LEDs are just not bright enough and need to be changed to more efficient ones. Last, a better battery solution needs to fit between the device’s two RJ9 jacks.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The good news is, it works and it's mostly functional. I built up three prototypes that need to be demonstrated to the major electronic stores as soon as I can get it to the 100% level. They have been contacted and are considering carrying it as a telephone and mobile phone accessory. From these royalties, I can pay off the remaining debt and finish the patent application. Or, with enough contributions; I can go directly into production and build both Asia versions for world-wide sales and US Built versions too from the same manufacturer that is based both here in the Silicon Valley with additional manufacturing capabilities in China. Also, any extra funding will be to get the extra wireless approvals (the BT chip is approved FCC and ETSI, but not the finished device). Any more funding and I can streamline its introduction and be able to patent iConnect worldwide.</p>
<p>I now need to move to the next phase of development which is the tooling for full production and making case molds. The investment in Marketing, Patenting, R&amp;D and bench testing has taken over 1 year so I know that the design is sound and all that remains is funding the final phase of our project.<br/><br/> By backing this project you will enable me to bring iConnect Hands-Free to the world and a dream to reality. You will also be enabling me to hire and bring on talented people to continue the work to bring other ideas for products that extend the use of things you already own and other re-use designs for the future.</p>
<p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>As a backer of our project you will be one of the first to get a brand new fully functional iConnect HF in your hand for use at the office, home or when you travel. By being a part of the project in its infancy, you will receive your very own signed (by me, the inventor) device and the knowledge that you were a part of something big that created something very small.</p>
<p><strong>Where will your funding go?</strong></p>
<p>First - Complete the initial product with the software fix, brighter LEDs and power supply. If I get more, I will get the PCB re-laid out so all components are on the top so it’s easier and much less costly to manufacture in higher quantities. If the funding I receive is SUPER, I will be able to complete the patent applications to the USPTO and build the better version for direct sales! I have already invested heavily in the development of this project. Your funding is the critical link to the completion of our project and will be used to realize a dream!</p>
<p>I have working prototypes and a supply chain that's ready to go. I need your help to take the next step(s).</p>
<p><strong>What is iConnect HF (Hands-Free)?</strong></p>
<p>It is a small dual capability (wired AND wireless) device to make a typical telephone hands-free when you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>How does iConnect HF work?</strong></p>
<p>It’s very simple to use. If you’re going to use the wireless Bluetooth option, you just have to one-time pair it within an inch (security feature so will not pair with devices you don’t want it to) on the iC HF with your ear-set or other BT enabled wireless device. After that, it works up to 60 feet or so away per the Bluetooth standard. If you want to use your wired hands-free ear-set, push the button twice. The second push will disable and turn off the wireless Bluetooth and enable both ear set jacks on the device (great for those who don’t want wireless near their body and want the extra security too).</p>

I started like most of us - just a guy watching Power Rangers and more often than not being mocked for it. My closest friends watched it with me, but it was pretty much only me that stuck with it.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Then the Internet happened. I found that I wasn't the only one in to this kinda stuff.  I found sites that sold fansubbed tapes, I found online communities and just a wealth of fans that actually wanted to discuss the lore of these silly/awesome shows. And through meeting and befriending incredibly heroic people that are now my geek family, HJU was born and we all got to hang together.  </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Literally hundreds of thousands of individuals have graced our humble halls of justice. Old fans, new born fans, and I know of one couple even that met on our boards and married. I can't thank you enough and now I ask for your help. </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span>I give you, the Power Up Justice Indigogo Campaign for HenshinJustice.Com. We've pulled together in the past to raise money for worthy causes.... and this time the fight... is for you. I have a lot of friends and connections that can help kick HJU in to overdrive, but coding, licenses, and some custom reprogramming is needed, and that will cost us some money. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>If we hit the goal of $1,200 we get our own dedicated server for a year. That means no more slowdowns and a lot more security.   </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>But I want to do a full-on overhaul. Fully customized HJU Store, gallery, podcasting, combining the blog and forum completely and several other cool ideas to make HJU all that it possibly can be. It will cost around $4,500 for all the improvements we need and the work needed to do it. Anything over that goes back into the site and related projects to make your experience more fun, interactive, enjoyable and what I hope will become the vehicle that continues to grow our fandom for many years to come. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>We've friends from ToonZone.Net willing to help with the redesign, our friends from Toku Access are helping supply the t-shirt rewards, Hypercats Network is working on some custom toys, and as time rolls on we'll see what else we can do to make this donation drive fun and in a show of thanks... see if we can't give you something in return for all of your help. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>So, that's it. Together we have made this dream of our fandom a reality and now let's work together to make an even greater dream for all of us that are a part of the HJU family and those that are still to come. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>$1,200 - Dedicated Server </span></p>
<p> </p>

<p><span> </span></p></div>","Henshin Justice Unlimited is beyond a dream come true. I started like most of us - just a guy watching Power Rangers and more often than not being mocked for it. My closest friends watched it with me, but it was pretty much only me that stuck with it.
Then the Internet happened. I found that I wasn't the only one in to this kinda stuff.  I found sites that sold fansubbed tapes, I found online communities and just a wealth of fans that actually wanted to discuss the lore of these silly/awesome shows. And through meeting and befriending incredibly heroic people that are now my geek family, HJU was born and we all got to hang together.  
Literally hundreds of thousands of individuals have graced our humble halls of justice. Old fans, new born fans, and I know of one couple even that met on our boards and married. I can't thank you enough and now I ask for your help. 
 
I give you, the Power Up Justice Indigogo Campaign for HenshinJustice.Com. We've pulled together in the past to raise money for worthy causes.... and this time the fight... is for you. I have a lot of friends and connections that can help kick HJU in to overdrive, but coding, licenses, and some custom reprogramming is needed, and that will cost us some money. 
 
If we hit the goal of $1,200 we get our own dedicated server for a year. That means no more slowdowns and a lot more security.   
 
But I want to do a full-on overhaul. Fully customized HJU Store, gallery, podcasting, combining the blog and forum completely and several other cool ideas to make HJU all that it possibly can be. It will cost around $4,500 for all the improvements we need and the work needed to do it. Anything over that goes back into the site and related projects to make your experience more fun, interactive, enjoyable and what I hope will become the vehicle that continues to grow our fandom for many years to come. 
 
We've friends from ToonZone.Net willing to help with the redesign, our friends from Toku Access are helping supply the t-shirt rewards, Hypercats Network is working on some custom toys, and as time rolls on we'll see what else we can do to make this donation drive fun and in a show of thanks... see if we can't give you something in return for all of your help. 
 
So, that's it. Together we have made this dream of our fandom a reality and now let's work together to make an even greater dream for all of us that are a part of the HJU family and those that are still to come. 
 
$1,200 - Dedicated Server

<div>It's a great time to be a driver.  With smartphones and maps apps, we can get anywhere in the world.  Drivers are embracing this technology, and relying on smartphones as their preferred navigation tool.  However, f<span>ar too often drivers stash phones in the car cupholder, and turn away from the road to check their next turn.  We believe that drivers deserve better, and set out to invent a convenient and safe way to navigate on the road.</span>

<div>We came up with DashIT, a simple way for drivers to keep smartphone maps within sight while driving.  We looked at all the methods available on the market, from the suction cup, to the sticky adhesive, and nothing did the trick.  So we designed, engineered and are producing the first run of this car accessory that <span>rests on the car dashboard propping the phone up at an angle so the driver can navigate with ease.  It's quite simple really: a mount that works with most any phone in just about any car, that keeps your maps within sight.  </span>

<br/><h2><b>4. The
tasks ahead </b></h2>
<p>
</p>
<h4>For GLBrain to finally become a
global brain we need to:</h4>
<p></p>
<h3><b>4.1.
Complete our communication and social network function </b></h3>
<p>(Time to finish: Q02/2014)</p>
<p>To increase our user base we plan to create a
new and unique communication function covering the most used functions of well
known social networks but based on our principals of user protection with respect to privacy and self control of his data.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Amongst them a special
personal profile with possibilities to post and uploaded content, posting,
chatting, newsfeed, searching, administrating and communicating with friends.</p>
<h3>
<b>4.2.</b> <b>Improve our user profiles</b><b>  </b>
</h3>
<p>(Time
to finish: End 2013)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Our standard profiles </b>will also be
updated with new functions enabling them to interact with the new communication
functions as well as to show and measure their actions in regard to sustainability and civic
value, enabling the normal user to show his interest and be actively involved
in sustainability and creating civic value.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our
profiles for professional use</b> will allow better presentation and get new
functions such as:</p>
<p>- creating and embedding direct access to
their internet shops</p>
<p>- selecting and showing categories and product ranges for
their activities</p>
<p>- easy advertising and communication with
anonymous users</p>
<p>- classification as CSR certified ISO 26000 </p>
<p>- similar GLBrain CSR Classification by self declaration</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>- special search
engine for organizations and companies by geographics, category,  product and
attributes like Social responsible, sustainable and more</p>
<p>- a system of
posting advertisement to all content of a category which can be focused by
country, city, sex and age group. Such advertising will open via a thumbnail its
own content and lead to the profile page, and online shop. A sample can be seen
already by advertising for this campaign on every GLBrain page.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<b>4.3. The
“Sustainability, Social Responsibility and Civic Value Mode”</b><b> </b>
</h3>
<p>(Time to finish:
Q01/2014)</p>
<p>The main focus of GLBrain is to promote
sustainability, social responsibility and create civic value through day
by day usage of the internet.</p>
<p>All  present or future services and
functions shown above are made to motivate our users to make GLBrain the
internet platform of their choice and to generate the user base and traffic
necessary to create positive effects by changing their own behavior to promote these principles on all levels.</p>
<p>This is a massive task but GLBrain has been
specifically designed for this and most of the main functions like the
categories, Global, Local and the MyBrain levels and possibilities for
movements and voting ballots are already implemented.</p>
<p>Some of the new functions have been mentioned
above in the new user profiles. Some more are:</p>
<p>-
creating a non public ""suggest and report"" function that allows
control of such declarations by the users</p>
<p>- creating special search functions to browse
by attributes like ""Socially Responsible Company"" or
""Sustainable Product"" and then showing only users, companies, stores,
products and GLBrain content matching such attributes</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>- this being linked to
the embedded internet shops will help users to make their decisions and buying sustainable
products from socially responsible companies</p>
<p></p>
<p>- we will also create tools and
statistics to easily show the effective change of behavior in millions of our
users</p>
<p>- and many more.</p>
<p>The interaction between the user's MyBrain and
general content on all countries Local and all Global Levels makes GLBrain
become the place where the individual user can take control of society and is
provided a better way to act socially responsible, change their behavior and
share their ideas.</p>
<h3><b>4.4. Some
additional technical issues</b></h3>
<p>To follow and promote our planned growth we
need to:</p>
<p><b>Expand
our server capacity</b> to match our increasing demand  (Time: 
as needed)</p>
<p><b>Add many
more languages</b>.   (We plan 5-7
per month)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our final goal is
to cover all languages natively spoken by more than 10 Million people. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Having already
translated GLBrain into 18 languages we reach about 35 % of the world population
in their native language. To reach this goal we have to add about 40 more
languages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quite a challenging and costly task, but
absolutely necessary. In addition we will implement a professional tool
managing all changes in so many languages.</p>
<p><b>Implement
a translation tool</b> also enabling direct translation of all content between all
languages available in GLBrain.</p>
<h3>4.5.  Summary of what we already have and what we will do</h3>
<p>Completing this tasks will make GLBrain to be a fully integrated internet platform and social network, offering many known functions in a unique and new way. All based on our principles with regard to privacy and data control by our users, and promoting sustainability, social responsibility and civic value.</p>
<p>This picture shows, what we already offer today and how GLBrain will look like, when the tasks described here will be completed in about 6-9 months time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/147662/files/20131022065726-indieGOGO-Headlines.jpg?1382450246"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>
<b>4.6.
Marketing Campaigns</b><b> </b>
</h3>
<p><b> </b>(Time: All year 2014)</p>
<p>We also need to run marketing campaigns on a
global and local level to further attract NGOs and Companies who would use
GLBrain and thus help us reach our goal of using the internet only in the best
interest of its users and to make this world a better place. We will spread out
our system of <a href=""http://www.glbrain.com/index.php?r=site/page&amp;view=careersAndPartnership"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">appointing local partners</a> ( now active in 10 countries) to many more
countries.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>5.
What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h2>
<h3><b>5.1.
We Need from you</b></h3>
<p>
To
cover all these tasks and costs necessary beyond our todays expense and to reach
a state of being self financed we would need <span>to
generate 50,000 Dollars through this campaign. Our normal operating expenses </span><br/></p>
<p>We know that at this point we could go on the
market to attract well known players in the internet business to invest in GLBrain,
yet this may not allow us to stay independent and follow our goal of being a
platform designed for the people and run it the way we and the users want to.</p>
<p>Any
money we receive will help us to reach our goals. Reaching
our target of 50,000 $ will allow us to perform all mentioned
technical and programming actions within the next 6-9 months as well as
enabling us to start a basic marketing campaign helping us to be a finished and
fully independent user controlled network at the end of 2014.</p>
<p>Any
money we receive in excess to our target will help us to run bigger
marketing campaigns and to faster expand GLBrain to many more countries. <br/></p>

<h2><b>6. FAQ</b></h2>
<p><b>Q:</b> <b>How can you improve
privacy knowing that almost all Internet and servers belong to big companies
influenced by powerful governments?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> It is difficult but
possible. We do not ask to use your actual name and address, your email is only
used for safe registration, then never again unless you forget your password.</p>
<p>The infrastructure was a major issue, as we could not use a
standard cloud and server infrastructure available on the market. We had to
build our own cloud system with the help of <a href=""http://www.dedicatedadmin.com/?page_id=30"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twinstar</a> and operate on dedicated servers only used forGLBrain.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> <b>Is it legal to allow
registration without the correct name?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> In many
countries like Germany, it is illegal to force a user to use his real name or to
delete his account for this reason. Facebook, for example, can only behave like
this as they are not operating under such countries' laws.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> <b>How do you prevent
illegal actions on GLBrain?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Our principles of
creating civic value will not allow illegal actions on our network. All content
of our <a href=""http://www.glbrain.com/index.php?r=site/page&amp;view=terms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">terms</a> of use and
<a href=""http://www.glbrain.com/index.php?r=site/page&amp;view=privacy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">privacy</a> policy are based on German law, the so far best and most user protective
Internet law. This goes along with a powerful <a href=""https://secure.glbrain.com/index.php?r=report/create&amp;toolId=5161&amp;reportType=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Suggest and Report Tool”</a> also matching German
law standards and allowing interaction with anonymous users or about content created
anonymously. We only allow embedding and linking to safe internet content.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> <b>Why is your headquarter located in
Dubai?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Globra FZ LLC, the
mother company is located in <a href=""http://www.dubaiinternetcity.com/#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dubai Internet City</a>, a Free Zone specially
created for these kinds of business and home to offices of almost all internet
companies and social networks like Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, Linked in,
Oracle and 500 more. Dubai Internet City hosts the biggest agglomeration of
Internet Companies in the world. </p>
<p><b>Q: Who is the real owner
of GLBrain?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Dr. Wolfgang Pinegger
and Dr. Walter Schwimmer.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> <b>What Banks and
Payment Providers do you use?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Our Bank accounts are
with Deutsche Bank AG and we are accepted by all major credit card and payment
service companies, as can be seen in our own payment system. <br/>For internet credit
card payments we use our Austrian Subsidiary Globra GmbH and the Austrian
Payment Provider <a href=""https://www.mpay24.com/web/pdf/en/mPAY24-Folder-EN.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mPay 24</a>.</p>

GLBrain, a new concept of a social network, using the
possibilities of the internet to form a global brain - informative,
communicative, creative, focusing on sustainability, social responsibility and
creating civic value, made to change our lives, the internet and this world for the better.


The basic idea was derived from
the following knowledge of how today's social networks
are structured:


The big social networks, have attracted a
huge user base, offering communication based services, creating user profiles
by watching and storing their behavior and interest. This profile data combined
with a totally identified user is sold and built the basis of their business
model. Sometimes such data is further used by governmental institutions for
their own purposes. They are not
interested in anything but their own
business without respect to privacy or any
specific interest to make the internet work for the better of society.


Content based webpages and networks, focus on sustainability, social responsibility and civic
values. They want to spread their ideas but lack the user base to do so.



We in GLBrain wanted use the internet to form a Global Brain and
make change happen. For this we needed to develop a platform attracting a big
user base by offering all well known functions of social networks but based on
our principles of privacy and data control by our users. On
such basis we offer new functionalities and a new business model allowing and
helping our users to follow our core values of sustainability, social
responsibility and creating civic value.

4. The
tasks ahead 


For GLBrain to finally become a
global brain we need to:

4.1.
Complete our communication and social network function 
(Time to finish: Q02/2014)
To increase our user base we plan to create a
new and unique communication function covering the most used functions of well
known social networks but based on our principals of user protection with respect to privacy and self control of his data.


Amongst them a special
personal profile with possibilities to post and uploaded content, posting,
chatting, newsfeed, searching, administrating and communicating with friends.

4.2. Improve our user profiles  

(Time
to finish: End 2013)


Our standard profiles will also be
updated with new functions enabling them to interact with the new communication
functions as well as to show and measure their actions in regard to sustainability and civic
value, enabling the normal user to show his interest and be actively involved
in sustainability and creating civic value.

Our
profiles for professional use will allow better presentation and get new
functions such as:
- creating and embedding direct access to
their internet shops
- selecting and showing categories and product ranges for
their activities
- easy advertising and communication with
anonymous users
- classification as CSR certified ISO 26000 
- similar GLBrain CSR Classification by self declaration


- special search
engine for organizations and companies by geographics, category,  product and
attributes like Social responsible, sustainable and more
- a system of
posting advertisement to all content of a category which can be focused by
country, city, sex and age group. Such advertising will open via a thumbnail its
own content and lead to the profile page, and online shop. A sample can be seen
already by advertising for this campaign on every GLBrain page.


4.3. The
“Sustainability, Social Responsibility and Civic Value Mode” 

(Time to finish:
Q01/2014)
The main focus of GLBrain is to promote
sustainability, social responsibility and create civic value through day
by day usage of the internet.
All  present or future services and
functions shown above are made to motivate our users to make GLBrain the
internet platform of their choice and to generate the user base and traffic
necessary to create positive effects by changing their own behavior to promote these principles on all levels.
This is a massive task but GLBrain has been
specifically designed for this and most of the main functions like the
categories, Global, Local and the MyBrain levels and possibilities for
movements and voting ballots are already implemented.
Some of the new functions have been mentioned
above in the new user profiles. Some more are:
-
creating a non public ""suggest and report"" function that allows
control of such declarations by the users
- creating special search functions to browse
by attributes like ""Socially Responsible Company"" or
""Sustainable Product"" and then showing only users, companies, stores,
products and GLBrain content matching such attributes


- this being linked to
the embedded internet shops will help users to make their decisions and buying sustainable
products from socially responsible companies

- we will also create tools and
statistics to easily show the effective change of behavior in millions of our
users
- and many more.
The interaction between the user's MyBrain and
general content on all countries Local and all Global Levels makes GLBrain
become the place where the individual user can take control of society and is
provided a better way to act socially responsible, change their behavior and
share their ideas.
4.4. Some
additional technical issues
To follow and promote our planned growth we
need to:
Expand
our server capacity to match our increasing demand  (Time: 
as needed)
Add many
more languages.   (We plan 5-7
per month)


Our final goal is
to cover all languages natively spoken by more than 10 Million people. 



Having already
translated GLBrain into 18 languages we reach about 35 % of the world population
in their native language. To reach this goal we have to add about 40 more
languages.

Quite a challenging and costly task, but
absolutely necessary. In addition we will implement a professional tool
managing all changes in so many languages.
Implement
a translation tool also enabling direct translation of all content between all
languages available in GLBrain.
4.5.  Summary of what we already have and what we will do
Completing this tasks will make GLBrain to be a fully integrated internet platform and social network, offering many known functions in a unique and new way. All based on our principles with regard to privacy and data control by our users, and promoting sustainability, social responsibility and civic value.
This picture shows, what we already offer today and how GLBrain will look like, when the tasks described here will be completed in about 6-9 months time.



4.6.
Marketing Campaigns 

 (Time: All year 2014)
We also need to run marketing campaigns on a
global and local level to further attract NGOs and Companies who would use
GLBrain and thus help us reach our goal of using the internet only in the best
interest of its users and to make this world a better place. We will spread out
our system of appointing local partners ( now active in 10 countries) to many more
countries.

5.
What We Need & What You Get
5.1.
We Need from you

To
cover all these tasks and costs necessary beyond our todays expense and to reach
a state of being self financed we would need to
generate 50,000 Dollars through this campaign. Our normal operating expenses 
We know that at this point we could go on the
market to attract well known players in the internet business to invest in GLBrain,
yet this may not allow us to stay independent and follow our goal of being a
platform designed for the people and run it the way we and the users want to.
Any
money we receive will help us to reach our goals. Reaching
our target of 50,000 $ will allow us to perform all mentioned
technical and programming actions within the next 6-9 months as well as
enabling us to start a basic marketing campaign helping us to be a finished and
fully independent user controlled network at the end of 2014.
Any
money we receive in excess to our target will help us to run bigger
marketing campaigns and to faster expand GLBrain to many more countries. 

5.2.
You Get from usWe wanted to start
this campaign only after having launched GLBrain and secured basic financing
until the end of 2014, to be able to better gain your trust and to be able to
offer already existing paid functions available on GLBrain in return for your sponsoring.
This way you get real value for your money and can use such functions of
GLBrain already at this early stage for much discounted rates.

5.2.1. Just
donating
For those who are not interested in such
benefits but still find our idea attractive to support we also offer a Perk for
just supporting us.
If they wish they also will be named in the
list of sponsors in the footer of GLBrain and published in a Glopinion of
thanks at the end of the campaign.
5.2.2. All other Perks consist of a combination of Customized Profile, Detailed
Statistics and Advertising packages on all levels
As a benefit we offer two versions of Customized Profiles 
(in new version as under 4.2 above by Jan. 1st 2014) on their own or
combined with the Statistic Tool  normally to be purchased as well as a great and more focused Advertising Function (GLAD) which already today can
be purchased in GLBrain. We offer this for different time periods being aware
of the fact that the value of these functions will increase with the expansion
of our user base. Please check in GLBrain or see here again the relevant
information.

Our perks for commercial users offer profile, statistic information and advertising
for different time periods in a very cost effective way. 

They also can be
used byOrganizations and NGO’s to spread their ideas along with our  content and are available in various versions
and include the following:

- full customized profile (New version as from 1.1.2014)  for 1, 2 or 3 years
- full access to all detailed statistics for 1, 2 or 3 years


- posting of GLADS
(GLobalADvertising) for 1 year 12 Glads, 2 years 24 Glads or 3 years 36 Glads.
The Glads can be
posted for 30 days maximum for the content of one of the 36 categories for all
users of one country, or focused further by city, sex and age group by the
detailed statistic tool. Such Glads will be shown on every Tool (Glopinion,
Lopinion, Article…) such selected users open in GLBrain. 

These perks will be available as from January 1st
2014.
Those using our perks to also receive a
customize profile will receive and show a medal of honor in 3 different
versions, Gold, Silver and Bronze identifying them as early contributors on
their customized profile. 
    
Further,
all participants will be listed in the list of sponsors structured by country,
alphabet and level of support they have been awarded. This list will always be
kept in the footer of GLBrain and published in a Glopinion of thanks at the end
of the campaign.
5.2.3. Just

transparency. With a special Glopinion and Lopinion active for all countries we
will inform our sponsors on a monthly basis about the progress of our actions
and how we spent the money.




6. FAQ
Q: How can you improve
privacy knowing that almost all Internet and servers belong to big companies
influenced by powerful governments?
A: It is difficult but
possible. We do not ask to use your actual name and address, your email is only
used for safe registration, then never again unless you forget your password.
The infrastructure was a major issue, as we could not use a
standard cloud and server infrastructure available on the market. We had to
build our own cloud system with the help of Twinstar and operate on dedicated servers only used forGLBrain.
Q: Is it legal to allow
registration without the correct name?
A: In many
countries like Germany, it is illegal to force a user to use his real name or to
delete his account for this reason. Facebook, for example, can only behave like
this as they are not operating under such countries' laws.
Q: How do you prevent
illegal actions on GLBrain?
A: Our principles of
creating civic value will not allow illegal actions on our network. All content
of our terms of use and
privacy policy are based on German law, the so far best and most user protective
Internet law. This goes along with a powerful “Suggest and Report Tool” also matching German
law standards and allowing interaction with anonymous users or about content created
anonymously. We only allow embedding and linking to safe internet content.
Q: Why is your headquarter located in
Dubai?
A: Globra FZ LLC, the
mother company is located in Dubai Internet City, a Free Zone specially
created for these kinds of business and home to offices of almost all internet
companies and social networks like Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, Linked in,
Oracle and 500 more. Dubai Internet City hosts the biggest agglomeration of
Internet Companies in the world. 
Q: Who is the real owner
of GLBrain?
A: Dr. Wolfgang Pinegger
and Dr. Walter Schwimmer.
Q: What Banks and
Payment Providers do you use?
A: Our Bank accounts are
with Deutsche Bank AG and we are accepted by all major credit card and payment
service companies, as can be seen in our own payment system. For internet credit
card payments we use our Austrian Subsidiary Globra GmbH and the Austrian
Payment Provider mPay 24.

We had a
dream and invested a lot of time and money to create GLBrain.
With your
help we all can continue to make the internet and this world a better
place.

<p>By using cunning edge technology being developed by our engineers, The Juicer , will be a one of a kind battery that is influenced from previous batteries, but with a reconstructed and innovative twist, which potentially could allow our battery to charge faster and last longer than anything available on the market. A special casing aluminum frame cover for the back of the phone is also being developed to make it more environmentally friendly, allowing it to be charged by any light source; all thanks to technology found on larger solar panels but on a micro scaled level. The Juicer will be a revolutionary battery that finally uses all of the technology available in today’s world. </p>

<ul><li><p>The Juicer is a small two person company influenced by the needs of our customer. We recognized how some people would carry chargers with them all the time. We also recognized how battery power is a huge consideration when buying a new cell phone. As a project for college, our lead German engineer, Vandal Schnizel, designed a micro prototype battery, which vastly exceeded his expectations. By modifying existing battery topologies to be more power efficient, he was able to record an astonishing power density that is 1900 times greater than other lithium ion batteries. Teaming up with me, Paul Bednard, lead business and marketing for The Juicer, we had a dream to use the technology Schnizel found on a macro scale to essentially create the worlds longest lasting cell phone battery. High on dreams but short on money, we came to indiegogo to help fund our revolutionary battery.</p></li></ul>

The world's highest capacity battery @ 13440mAh. More than 4 times than the original capacity & slimmer than other extended battery.  We estimate on heavy use, this battery can handle up to 40+ hours of internet browsing, 48 hours of HD movie watching, or 84 hours of 3g talk time.

     About the battery -                  
     

The Juicer uses the most innovative, groundbreaking lithium-ion battery available. 
Our battery reinvents typical electrode structure from standard li-ion batteries by adding a three-dimensional anode and cathode, replacing the modern two-dimensional anode and cathode, by doing so it increases the surface area; therefore, resulting in more chemical reactions to take place in the same amount of space, theoretically causing more discharge speed and charging. 
 Along with other groundbreaking things we can’t discuss, this would make our battery the best out there allowing it to last an estimated 25-70 percent longer than your generic smart phone battery.

that we can make CreoPopTM even better. We want to introduce new features and new types of inks after we finish the campaign, and we want to 

understand what you as a customer and a CreoPopTM owner would want. During and after the campaign we will send surveys to those who 

pledge to help guide our development. Joining us now makes you more than a simple contributor – you’re a partner in helping us making the world’s greatest 3D pen.
Our team has launched over 20 companies in 3D 

printing, consumer electronics, mobile communications, medical devices, vending machines and internet services. We’re not a bunch of kids with a vague idea – we’re used to getting things to the market. And we’re ready to 

do it again.Each ink cartridge can print a 14 meter line with the standard nozzle.Yes. Our logistics partner is able to 

ship to most locations around the world.Yes. 

The CreoPopTM pen is charged using a simple USB connection, and so it can be used anywhere in the world as long as you have access to USB 

charging through a computer or an adapter.Firstly, CreoPopTM uses light-sensitive photopolymers instead of heating and melting plastic at a high temperature. This 

makes the pen safe to use. Secondly, CreoPopTM works with an amazing selection of inks. Thirdly, CreoPopTM is totally cordless – nothing to knock your hand or pull the pen as you’re using it.Yes – safer than any other pen on the market. Our 

innovative photopolymer technology means that neither the pen nor the ink becomes warm. Other 3D pens heat to nearly 500 degrees Fahrenheit – nearly enough to break down a non-

stick cooking pan. To give you some context hot water at 156 degrees Fahrenheit will 

cause a burn in just one second.As well as making the safest pen on the market, we also make the safest ink. It does not contain any toxic material and does not emit any unpleasant or dangerous odors.

<p>SafeRide can be set to send you text alerts if the SafeRide system is disabled or not used as expected. </p>
<p>If you are a parent or employer, you can select how closely you want to monitor each SafeRide.  It can be as simple as checking to see it’s working every day, week or month.  </p>
<p>However, if you would like more oversight, you can set up a schedule specific to the user, so SafeRide can look for activity as it is expected and report if something is wrong.</p>

<p>If you receive a text message while your phone is locked, SafeRide will automatically respond, letting the other person know that you’re driving.  SafeRide can also be set to have a text sent to someone who calls you while driving, as long as they call from a phone that can receive your text.</p>

<p>We realize that there are a select group of apps that are designed to be used in the car.  The most obvious are your maps for navigation and internet radio.  If you use your phone as a GPS, you can enable that and up to 2 more Apps, which you feel are useful in the car.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>You can also allow for the use of a hands-free system (in-dash sync or headset), while the phone itself remains locked.  In this mode, the phone itself will not ring, but it will ring through your dash or earpiece.  </p>

<p>If you may be in your car as a passenger from time to time, you can enable Passenger Mode.  This mode allows you to use your phone one time (the audio stays on mute as a courtesy to the driver).  The next time you get in the car, the phone will lock again, just as it should.</p>
<p>You can also set a temporary PIN for Passenger mode that automatically expires after a specific date.</p>

<p>Of course, if there’s an emergency you can always call 9-1-1!  Our innovative approach allows you to call for help easily when in distress, however, it cannot be done accidentally.</p>

<p>We are working with a variety of insurance companies to offer you a discount if you are using SafeRide. In order to do this, we need to show hard data that proves that SafeRide works.  Your help now could help us get you a discount very soon!</p>
<p>SafeRide is not just for teen drivers either.  Possibly you just need a little help to remove the temptation, or if you want to set a good example for your kids.  Whether they are driving now or will be soon, SafeRide is a great way to show them that this is important for you too!</p>

<p>SafeRide works with nearly all Android phones.  Since Android makes up roughly 60% of the current US smartphone market by OS, we felt it made the most sense to start there.  </p>
<p>However, we are working diligently to develop an iPhone version of the SafeRide App, and expect to release it in the Spring of 2014.  At the same time, we are also developing solutions for Blackberry &amp; Windows devices, as well as non-smart phones.  With your help we can get there even faster.</p>

<p>We are just about ready to begin production on 1,000 units right now.  The design is complete - we have our FCC Certification and have been officially recognized by the Bluetooth SIG.  We need to finish our mechanical tooling and flip the switch.  </p>
<p>However, the only way will be able to truly test our technology and make improvements is by having it used in the real world.  We have tested it as thoroughly as we can on our own, now we need you to be one of our Beta Testers.  If you’re willing to beta test SafeRide, you'll be one of the first to get a SafeRide delivered to your door.  As soon as the first 1,000 are made (we are targeting January of 2014), we will send it to you, along with a Car Magnet to tell everyone that your ride is a SafeRide.  </p>
<p>We'll want to know how it goes, so we will need to communicate with you for at least the first month that you have your SafeRide.  We're looking for feedback on usability; we want to know of any issues you have, and any improvements you feel we should make.  </p>
<p>The SafeRide App is set up to be beta tested through the Google Play Store.  You'll be able to download, install and provide feedback, all from your phone - as long as you're not driving!  </p>
<p>As we make updates and improvements to the App, you'll have them sent to your phone. That way you will continually benefit from all of the data we collect from the entire group of Beta Testers.</p>
<p>After that, the SafeRide is your to keep.  We will even list your name in the App Credits as an official Beta Tester (unless, of course, you wish to remain anonymous).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/154050/files/20131025060323-sub_title_sr.jpg?1382706203"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Once we have gotten all of our Beta test results, we will need about one month to refine the App and complete our first official production run.  For everyone who contributes but would prefer not to be a Beta Tester, we expect to deliver your production SafeRide to you in February of 2014.  </p>

We realize that there are a select group of apps that are designed to be used in the car.  The most obvious are your maps for navigation and internet radio.  If you use your phone as a GPS, you can enable that and up to 2 more Apps, which you feel are useful in the car.
 

You can also allow for the use of a hands-free system (in-dash sync or headset), while the phone itself remains locked.  In this mode, the phone itself will not ring, but it will ring through your dash or earpiece.  
 

If you may be in your car as a passenger from time to time, you can enable Passenger Mode.  This mode allows you to use your phone one time (the audio stays on mute as a courtesy to the driver).  The next time you get in the car, the phone will lock again, just as it should.
You can also set a temporary PIN for Passenger mode that automatically expires after a specific date.
 

Of course, if there’s an emergency you can always call 9-1-1!  Our innovative approach allows you to call for help easily when in distress, however, it cannot be done accidentally.
 

We are working with a variety of insurance companies to offer you a discount if you are using SafeRide. In order to do this, we need to show hard data that proves that SafeRide works.  Your help now could help us get you a discount very soon!
SafeRide is not just for teen drivers either.  Possibly you just need a little help to remove the temptation, or if you want to set a good example for your kids.  Whether they are driving now or will be soon, SafeRide is a great way to show them that this is important for you too!
 

SafeRide is great for business owners too!  Whether you have a fleet of 500 trucks, or team of 5 sales people on the road every day, make sure they are not using their phone while driving a car for which you are responsible.
 
 
SafeRide is great for anyone who needs a little help resisting the temptation to use their phone while they drive their car!
  


SafeRide works with nearly all Android phones.  Since Android makes up roughly 60% of the current US smartphone market by OS, we felt it made the most sense to start there.  
However, we are working diligently to develop an iPhone version of the SafeRide App, and expect to release it in the Spring of 2014.  At the same time, we are also developing solutions for Blackberry & Windows devices, as well as non-smart phones.  With your help we can get there even faster.
 




We are just about ready to begin production on 1,000 units right now.  The design is complete - we have our FCC Certification and have been officially recognized by the Bluetooth SIG.  We need to finish our mechanical tooling and flip the switch.  
However, the only way will be able to truly test our technology and make improvements is by having it used in the real world.  We have tested it as thoroughly as we can on our own, now we need you to be one of our Beta Testers.  If you’re willing to beta test SafeRide, you'll be one of the first to get a SafeRide delivered to your door.  As soon as the first 1,000 are made (we are targeting January of 2014), we will send it to you, along with a Car Magnet to tell everyone that your ride is a SafeRide.  
We'll want to know how it goes, so we will need to communicate with you for at least the first month that you have your SafeRide.  We're looking for feedback on usability; we want to know of any issues you have, and any improvements you feel we should make.  
The SafeRide App is set up to be beta tested through the Google Play Store.  You'll be able to download, install and provide feedback, all from your phone - as long as you're not driving!  
As we make updates and improvements to the App, you'll have them sent to your phone. That way you will continually benefit from all of the data we collect from the entire group of Beta Testers.
After that, the SafeRide is your to keep.  We will even list your name in the App Credits as an official Beta Tester (unless, of course, you wish to remain anonymous).

Once we have gotten all of our Beta test results, we will need about one month to refine the App and complete our first official production run.  For everyone who contributes but would prefer not to be a Beta Tester, we expect to deliver your production SafeRide to you in February of 2014.  
Our customer & technical support are already available to answer any questions you have.  Whether you have questions about SafeRide or the Indiegogo campaign itself, call us at (855) 4-SafeRide today!
 


The best way to help us get SafeRide out in to the world is by making a contribution today.  For those that can contribute, we'll send you one of our great Perks!


I created SafeRide, not only for my family, but for everyone's... To make our roads a safer place to drive.  With your help, we can make this a reality.
Even if you can't support us through the perks, please help us spread our message - Share this campaign on Facebook and Twitter.  
You contribution can help us make the roads safer for you and your family! Help us reach our goal so we can begin saving lives!!!

<p>I have invented software technology – I call it magiXcan™ (pronounced ‘magic scan’) – that can decode media files, like digital photos, extremely fast using parallel processing. Prior to its invention, this may have been considered an extremely hard, if not impossible, problem to solve. This technology is showcased in our free Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 beta application and you can download it right now to experience its ultra-high speeds for yourself:</p>

<p>We need about $50K to conduct a one-year beta test run for Aros Magic Viewer with magiXcan. If we are able to attract more funding it will be possible to do much, much more – we can broaden the scope of the underlying magiXcan technology, get it into more devices, and indeed utterly revolutionize consumer computing – going way, way beyond the simple speeding up of photo viewing that Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 showcases. I will explain why and how below, but do start by giving Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 a twirl. Seeing is believing.</p>

<h1>THE SHORT STORY</h1>
<ul>
<li>magiXcan is currently implemented for JPEG photo viewing speedup on Microsoft Windows only. This you can use today: simply <a href=""http://download.arosmagic.com/beta/setupAMViewer.exe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">download Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 beta </a>and you're off. The $50K we're seeking here will help turn this beta into a finished/polished product.</li>
<li>magiXcan needs to be implemented for other file formats – photos, documents, audio, video, etc. It also needs to be ported to MacOS and Android. This requires substantially more funding. The more formats magiXcan supports, the faster your computer will become. This will enable the production of way faster, cheaper and lower-energy computers. We are hoping your support will go well beyond the basic $50K we’re asking for – the greater your support, the more we can do.</li>
<li>magiXcan needs to be deep inside an operating system for it to yield maximum performance. This requires even more engineering, thus funding. After your initial support, we intend to raise the funds we need by licensing magiXcan to 3rd parties in due course.</li>
<li>For your support, we are offering, among other cool items, unique high-resolution print T-shirts featuring the colorful magiXcan monkey. Check out the designs on <a href=""http://www.magixcan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.magiXcan.com</a>. You can also license our technology or rent our brains.</li>

<p>Some say that in the simple equation <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Z<sub>n+1</sub> = Z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + C</a> you can find any shape your heart may desire. To capture the soul of magiXcan, I went looking for a magic monkey using a <a href=""http://www.arosmagic.com/Fractals"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fractal generating program that I built long ago </a>(it’s free) – and found it! The magiXcan monkey image is built from an infinite number of smaller monkeys like itself – symbolizing parallelism in Space conquering Time.</p>
<p>If we already had magiXcan-enabled massively parallel computers available, this would have been a relatively quick task, but sadly we don’t (yet). It took many computers working simultaneously several weeks to number-crunch billions upon billions pixels to create the unique fractal that is the magiXcan monkey. Finding the right shape was only the first step, though. For its coloring, I devised novel formulas that, when wielded like an artist's toolbox, yield a vast range of colorful magiXcan monkeys that have never before been created in the history of the Universe!

<p>That is our campaign in a nutshell, but if you want to know more about magiXcan and our plans for it, please read on.</p>
<h1>THE LONG STORY</h1>
<p>Here is the general trend with CPU speeds, display resolutions and digital photo sizes:<br/><br/>1990: 0.05GHz CPU, 0.5MP display, 0.5MP photos.<br/>2000: 2GHz CPU, 2MP display, 2MP photos.<br/>2010: 4GHz CPU, 3MP display, 16MP photos.<br/>2020:  (6GHz CPU, 8MP display, 50MP photos)???<br/><br/>Notice a clear pattern – your CPU hasn’t been getting appreciably faster for over a decade now, but picture sizes have been getting a whole lot bigger. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Moore’s Law </a>famously states that the transistor-count on chips will double every couple of years – and this has certainly happened, in part explaining why the pixel count of your pictures has increased so dramatically. But CPUs have hit a clock frequency ceiling with manufacturers unable to crank up clock speeds in the way they have in the past, largely because of thermal limitations resulting from increased power consumption when clock speeds are raised further. So the increased transistor count we are getting as per Moore’s Law is essentially going into the ever-increasing number of cores in CPUs, while their clock speeds have stagnated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it comes to the using of these many cores with parallel algorithms, we run into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amdahl’s Law</a>. This roughly says that there are limits to how fast you can process data if certain parts of it are serial. Because clock speeds have languished and photo (and other media) files are largely decompressed sequentially, we have reached a limit in terms of how fast we can decompress, i.e. consume, them. Even if we had 32 MP displays available today, our present (and foreseeable) CPUs simply wouldn’t be able to decompress and feed images of that size to those displays fast enough, because conventional methods aren’t fast enough. The increased core counts that are available these days are of no help in this situation (and wouldn’t be even if we had 100-core CPUs).</p>
<p>When I excitedly took the iPad for a spin at an Apple store upon its launch, the very first thing I did was download a bunch of photos taken on a typical digital camera (at the time ~12 MP each). Besides them loading slowly, my attempt to view them full-size crashed the machine in no time at all. I suspect it ran out of memory and panicked. More recently, when I tried out a newer iPad, I noticed that upon using its compulsory iTunes photo transfer utility, it automatically reduced the size of stored images. I think the iPad is incapable of loading today's normal-sized photos without compromising speed and memory usage. I daresay photo display is a major reason tablet/phone processors need to run at high clock frequency with excess RAM and thus consume so much battery power.</p>
<h1>THE BREAKTHROUGH – MAGIXCAN™</h1>

</center>
<p>I have succeeded in parallelizing a major subclass of these problems of decompression, calling my solution magiXcan. You can read technical details in its <a href=""http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2011143585"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">patent filing</a>. MagiXcan is the secret sauce that makes Aros Magic Viewer3 so very fast. But faster photo viewing is only the tip of the iceberg. Ultimately magiXcan is technology that may enable your N-core computer to run N-fold faster for all the stuff that really matters than it currently does. If you are like most consumers, the single most taxing task your CPU does is digital media processing, which is fundamentally just decompression. A lot of the rest of the time your CPU is just idling. Thus, decompressing data N-times faster is, practically speaking, the same as speeding up your machine N-fold.</p>
<p>MagiXcan is a significant breakthrough, and it is not just sheer speed that is revolutionized. Say we have a 100-core machine and have effectively achieved all the speed improvement we care for – then this capacity for faster processing can be directly translated into reduced energy consumption – in other words we can trade off speed against energy consumed. So instead of processing photos 100X faster on this 100-core machine, we could process them merely 10X faster, but at the same time using up only a tenth of the original power required – by lowering the clock frequency by the same factor. You can see the disruptive potential of this breakthrough even if you aren’t a speed freak.</p>
<p>Besides the obvious ecological benefits of reduced energy consumption, consider that consumer computing is increasingly shifting towards portable computing platforms (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) that run on batteries. The battery life of your mobile computing device is determined by how much energy it consumes. Less energy consumption directly translates into longer battery life (or smaller, thus less polluting, batteries). With a judicious application of magiXcan, one can conceive of portable computers that last weeks on a single charge – and all without sacrificing great performance. Check out this <a href=""http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/tegra_white_papers/Benefits-of-Multi-core-CPUs-in-Mobile-Devices_Ver1.2.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">white paper from nVidia </a>that goes into details about these tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Just as the easy availability of a quad-core processor enabled a code-monkey like me to invent magiXcan, the greater availability of cheap massively parallel computers (imagine million+ core tiny computers available for pennies) will fuel the invention of hitherto fringe technologies like TRUE Artificial Intelligence, holo-physicians, nano-robots, full cybernetic augmentation, personalized genomic synthesizers and who knows what else. But that will not happen soon enough if we don’t find uses for processors with core-counts in the 10-1000 range. MagiXcan gives you a valid reason to purchase the highest core-count you can afford, thus accelerating the future availability of stuff that is merely fantasized about in Science Fiction today. Before magiXcan, the utility of massively parallel CPU-cores appeared marginal (how often do you do video transcoding?). Not any longer, making technology like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larrabee_%28microarchitecture%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Intel’s Larrabee </a>usable in every-day applications. After all, compressed media consumption is what most of us use computers for, most of the time.</p>
<p>The implications of pervasive magiXcan are such that our entire computing landscape could be turned upside down – subject to a good start from you, of course. End result: faster, cheaper and cooler computers. (And maybe a cylon of your own in this lifetime!)</p>

<h1>THE SUPPORT NEEDED</h1>
<p>Our hope is that millions will download and use Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 to browse their ever-larger collections of ever-bigger photos. However, supporting such a large number of users is costly, starting with high-speed servers and bandwidth in pricey data centers. So this is, in the first instance, an appeal to raise $50K to deliver Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 beta to users and support them for a year. To repeat, Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 is already built and ready for you to download and use – we don’t need funding to build a prototype, I have done that on my own steam. What we don’t have, and are asking you to help fund, is the capacity to handle what we believe will be a HUGELY popular FREE product, as there are many logistical and technical issues to be addressed to successfully operate a worldwide program of beta testing capable of handling hundreds of thousands of users, and to respond to their feedback and suggestions. The result will be a tested and refined product that will be adopted by millions more. Even if you don’t want to or can’t give monetary support, it helps if you simply download and use <a href=""http://www.arosmagic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aros Magic software </a>and recommend it to others.</p>
<p>This is how I envisage the logical evolution of magiXcan (and the rough costs and timeframes required for implementing the respective stages, the first three of which can potentially be enabled by Indiegogo alone):</p>
<ol>
<li>$50K / 12 months: Run online beta test cycle for Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 for Windows. Enhance back-end online services. Stabilize existing feature set.  Provide basic online support for beta users.</li>
<li>$250K / 12 months: Support a user-base of 10+ million, providing wider online support. Add more online services and features to Aros Magic Viewer 3.0(e.g., special-effects, image-processing filters). Enhancements for touch enabled devices.</li>
<li>$1M / 18 months:  Add more image file formats (e.g. TIFF, PNG, GIF, etc.). Develop a standardized high-performance media processing library usable by 3rd parties. We hope to reach this level at Indiegogo.</li>
<li>$5M / 24 months:  Develop Photo (and other digital media) Management/Editing/Consumption software. Port the technology to MacOS and Android(x86).</li>
<li>$15M / 36 months: Extend to other, non-video file formats. Web browser plugins, iOS and Android(ARM), embedded systems(e.g, cameras, TVs, digital frames) effectively making magiXcan available across multiple devices and platforms.</li>
<li>$50M/60 months: Video codecs. Create system modules so that an existing OS {BSD, Linux, Windows} can be turbocharged into becoming a scalable, extensible platform for massively parallel computers. This may form the basis of most future computing; at least until we get usable quantum/optical computers out of the labs.</li>
</ol><p>Note that Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 is just the first licensee of magiXcan. We will license magiXcan to other 3rd parties like OS vendors, device manufacturers/OEMs and app developers as the platform matures.</p>
<h1>THE SOFTWARE, THE COMPANY, ITS MAGIC-USERS &amp; THEIR PRIME DIRECTIVE</h1>
<center><a href=""http://www.arosmagic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Aros Magic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/465446/pictures/full/20120928211813-RoundLogo150.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></center>
<p>When I decided to launch my own venture to build and publish software, it took me a long time to choose an appropriate name for it. It always seems that the good ones are already taken. I sat down and deeply thought about my core values and what my activities were really about. I enjoy building AND sharing cool stuff. I am also grateful that countless mathematicians, scientists and engineers have provided me the necessary means so that I can do these magical things. I wish to give back in whichever way I can. This desire for wanting feelings of joy and happiness in others is my definition of Love.</p>
<p>So I founded Aros Magic. It’s all about “Love &amp; Magic”. Its mission is to lovingly create technology so magical that its primary effect is joy and happiness, i.e:</p>
<center><span style=""text-align: center; font-size: large;""><span style=""color: red;"">♥</span> → ∞</span></center>
<p>A successful Indiegogo launch will enable us to assemble a like-minded/hearted team of talented engineers and designers driven by the desire to build extremely fast, beautiful and fun magical technologies the likes of which have never been experienced before, but will make you extremely happy.</p>
<p>Movers, Shakers and Dreamers are encouraged to apply at <a href=""http://www.arosmagic.com/Jobs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.arosmagic.com/Jobs</a>. We are open to relocating magiXcan development to where most of you want to reside; though it is most likely going to be Seattle or the Bay Area.</p>

Besides them loading slowly, my attempt to view them full-size crashed the machine in no time at all. I suspect it ran out of memory and panicked. More recently, when I tried out a newer iPad, I noticed that upon using its compulsory iTunes photo transfer utility, it automatically reduced the size of stored images. I think the iPad is incapable of loading today's normal-sized photos without compromising speed and memory usage. I daresay photo display is a major reason tablet/phone processors need to run at high clock frequency with excess RAM and thus consume so much battery power.
THE BREAKTHROUGH – MAGIXCAN™

(more on magiXcan.com)

I have succeeded in parallelizing a major subclass of these problems of decompression, calling my solution magiXcan. You can read technical details in its patent filing. MagiXcan is the secret sauce that makes Aros Magic Viewer3 so very fast. But faster photo viewing is only the tip of the iceberg. Ultimately magiXcan is technology that may enable your N-core computer to run N-fold faster for all the stuff that really matters than it currently does. If you are like most consumers, the single most taxing task your CPU does is digital media processing, which is fundamentally just decompression. A lot of the rest of the time your CPU is just idling. Thus, decompressing data N-times faster is, practically speaking, the same as speeding up your machine N-fold.
MagiXcan is a significant breakthrough, and it is not just sheer speed that is revolutionized. Say we have a 100-core machine and have effectively achieved all the speed improvement we care for – then this capacity for faster processing can be directly translated into reduced energy consumption – in other words we can trade off speed against energy consumed. So instead of processing photos 100X faster on this 100-core machine, we could process them merely 10X faster, but at the same time using up only a tenth of the original power required – by lowering the clock frequency by the same factor. You can see the disruptive potential of this breakthrough even if you aren’t a speed freak.
Besides the obvious ecological benefits of reduced energy consumption, consider that consumer computing is increasingly shifting towards portable computing platforms (phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) that run on batteries. The battery life of your mobile computing device is determined by how much energy it consumes. Less energy consumption directly translates into longer battery life (or smaller, thus less polluting, batteries). With a judicious application of magiXcan, one can conceive of portable computers that last weeks on a single charge – and all without sacrificing great performance. Check out this white paper from nVidia that goes into details about these tradeoffs.
Just as the easy availability of a quad-core processor enabled a code-monkey like me to invent magiXcan, the greater availability of cheap massively parallel computers (imagine million+ core tiny computers available for pennies) will fuel the invention of hitherto fringe technologies like TRUE Artificial Intelligence, holo-physicians, nano-robots, full cybernetic augmentation, personalized genomic synthesizers and who knows what else. But that will not happen soon enough if we don’t find uses for processors with core-counts in the 10-1000 range. MagiXcan gives you a valid reason to purchase the highest core-count you can afford, thus accelerating the future availability of stuff that is merely fantasized about in Science Fiction today. Before magiXcan, the utility of massively parallel CPU-cores appeared marginal (how often do you do video transcoding?). Not any longer, making technology like Intel’s Larrabee usable in every-day applications. After all, compressed media consumption is what most of us use computers for, most of the time.
The implications of pervasive magiXcan are such that our entire computing landscape could be turned upside down – subject to a good start from you, of course. End result: faster, cheaper and cooler computers. (And maybe a cylon of your own in this lifetime!)

(Aros Magic Viewer3 breaks the speed limit!)
THE SUPPORT NEEDED
Our hope is that millions will download and use Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 to browse their ever-larger collections of ever-bigger photos. However, supporting such a large number of users is costly, starting with high-speed servers and bandwidth in pricey data centers. So this is, in the first instance, an appeal to raise $50K to deliver Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 beta to users and support them for a year. To repeat, Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 is already built and ready for you to download and use – we don’t need funding to build a prototype, I have done that on my own steam. What we don’t have, and are asking you to help fund, is the capacity to handle what we believe will be a HUGELY popular FREE product, as there are many logistical and technical issues to be addressed to successfully operate a worldwide program of beta testing capable of handling hundreds of thousands of users, and to respond to their feedback and suggestions. The result will be a tested and refined product that will be adopted by millions more. Even if you don’t want to or can’t give monetary support, it helps if you simply download and use Aros Magic software and recommend it to others.
This is how I envisage the logical evolution of magiXcan (and the rough costs and timeframes required for implementing the respective stages, the first three of which can potentially be enabled by Indiegogo alone):

$50K / 12 months: Run online beta test cycle for Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 for Windows. Enhance back-end online services. Stabilize existing feature set.  Provide basic online support for beta users.
$250K / 12 months: Support a user-base of 10+ million, providing wider online support. Add more online services and features to Aros Magic Viewer 3.0(e.g., special-effects, image-processing filters). Enhancements for touch enabled devices.
$1M / 18 months:  Add more image file formats (e.g. TIFF, PNG, GIF, etc.). Develop a standardized high-performance media processing library usable by 3rd parties. We hope to reach this level at Indiegogo.
$5M / 24 months:  Develop Photo (and other digital media) Management/Editing/Consumption software. Port the technology to MacOS and Android(x86).
$15M / 36 months: Extend to other, non-video file formats. Web browser plugins, iOS and Android(ARM), embedded systems(e.g, cameras, TVs, digital frames) effectively making magiXcan available across multiple devices and platforms.
$50M/60 months: Video codecs. Create system modules so that an existing OS {BSD, Linux, Windows} can be turbocharged into becoming a scalable, extensible platform for massively parallel computers. This may form the basis of most future computing; at least until we get usable quantum/optical computers out of the labs.
Note that Aros Magic Viewer 3.0 is just the first licensee of magiXcan. We will license magiXcan to other 3rd parties like OS vendors, device manufacturers/OEMs and app developers as the platform matures.
THE SOFTWARE, THE COMPANY, ITS MAGIC-USERS & THEIR PRIME DIRECTIVE

When I decided to launch my own venture to build and publish software, it took me a long time to choose an appropriate name for it. It always seems that the good ones are already taken. I sat down and deeply thought about my core values and what my activities were really about. I enjoy building AND sharing cool stuff. I am also grateful that countless mathematicians, scientists and engineers have provided me the necessary means so that I can do these magical things. I wish to give back in whichever way I can. This desire for wanting feelings of joy and happiness in others is my definition of Love.
So I founded Aros Magic. It’s all about “Love & Magic”. Its mission is to lovingly create technology so magical that its primary effect is joy and happiness, i.e:
♥ → ∞
A successful Indiegogo launch will enable us to assemble a like-minded/hearted team of talented engineers and designers driven by the desire to build extremely fast, beautiful and fun magical technologies the likes of which have never been experienced before, but will make you extremely happy.
Movers, Shakers and Dreamers are encouraged to apply at http://www.arosmagic.com/Jobs. We are open to relocating magiXcan development to where most of you want to reside; though it is most likely going to be Seattle or the Bay Area.
BTW…
If you have a 48-core (or higher) computer, please let us know how much faster images load on it. 100X?

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>Our Story</strong><br/> We're a group of golfers who started out with a website dedicated to providing quality golf equipment at prices ordinary golfers could afford. As we heard from thousands of our customers, it became apparent that what they really needed (and was completely absent) was a way to rate golf courses that ordinary golfers could use and make smart decisions, unlike current guides (the <strong>Hacker's Guide</strong>).</p>
<p>With the mobile revolution, we realized we could provide both equipment retailing and ratings, as well as many more tools, in a unique and intuitive fashion through the smartphone. With this ""secret weapon"" we could make golf more accessible to amateur golfers by taking all of the time &amp; hassle - and more than a little of the expense - out of finding a course, making a tee time and enjoying golf! That was the intellectual birth of the Mobile Golfer.<br/><br/><strong>The Problem</strong><br/> You’d think with over 650,000 apps in the Apple App Store and almost as many for the Android, you’d have already found the perfect app for a golfer. Yes, there are a number of apps out there, but most perform only one or two functions and then not very intuitively. Rather than making the golf experience better, they are inelegant and don't efficiently do the things you want them to do. They get downloaded once and then never used again. Ugh! Mobile devices are designed to empower users, not just put a screen and virtual buttons where paper, pencil and phone used to be.</p>
<p>Today, in order to get golfing, the typical golfer often has six or more apps open and none of the information is shared between them. Something as simple as taking the name of the golf course and dropping it into a scorecard automatically doesn’t happen. Can you say 'integration'? And where is the ability to send a simple invitation to friends? It doesn't exist in current apps.</p>
<p><strong>Our Solution</strong><br/> So we asked the question “can we make an app that combines all of these golf functions into one golf tool?”  Our tech team said “h*ll yeah!” so we decided to build the Mobile Golfer – the app that does everything for a golfer except swing the club.<br/><br/><strong>Here’s How it Works</strong><br/> Simplicity of design is essential, just as Steve Jobs envisioned. The very best features in the Mobile Golfer are the services performed in the background, enabling the golfer to spend time golfing instead of ordering, organizing and administering. Ever try to put together a simple foursome and match everyone's schedule to available tee times? It's nearly impossible and way too time consuming.<br/><br/> Remember we talked about simplicity? One click fires up the Mobile Golfer. Right in front of you are a series of functions…directory, scorecard, online tee time booking, etc. Each is integrated with the other. A course selected from the directory is used to make a tee time, populate the score card, register a USGA handicap and so on. The same data is shared across functions. You only have to launch one app.<br/><br/> View the <em><strong>Functions Chart</strong></em> in the gallery.</p>
<p><strong>Donation Levels</strong><br/> Our development team wants you to be involved from the beginning and help us create a great app. We also want to provide you with golf stuff that you can use right away as you are waiting for the beta and subsequently, Version 1.0. We've created a chart that shows what you should expect dependent upon what level you decide to participate. It corresponds to the level listed on the right column (see <strong><em>Contributors Chart</em></strong> in the gallery).</p>
<p><strong>Why We Need You</strong><br/> We can't do this alone. We've been planning, designing and specifying this app for much of the year. We've been talking to third parties getting them to agree to integrate their functions into our app. We've been building our database of golf course information and ratings to make it the best out there, but we can't begin to code without you and your support.</p>
<p>If you are a golfer, a techie, a philanthropist or you just like cool ideas, we think you'll appreciate what we are doing.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support!</p>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the Hacker’s Guide?</strong><br/> The Hacker’s Guide (<a href=""http://www.hackersguides.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hackersguides.com</a>) was started in 2007 to rate golf courses for the typical golfer (the ‘hacker’) who shoots over 90 on eighteen holes (that’s actually 78% of us according to the National Golf Foundation). In 2008 we rated 87 courses in the Twin Cities with our first book (the <a href=""http://www.hackerscentralonline.com/shop/vmchk/the-hacker-s-guide/hacker%E2%80%99s-guide-to-twin-cities"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>Hacker’s Guide to Twin Cities Golf Courses</em></a>), in 2009 we expanded our footprint by rating 283 public courses in Minnesota and western Wisconsin (the <em><a href=""http://www.hackerscentralonline.com/shop/the-hackers-guide/minnesota"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hacker's Guide to Minnesota &amp; Western Wisconsin Golf Courses</a></em>) and in our third season rated over 500 courses in the 5-state Upper Midwest region (MN, WI, IA, ND &amp; SD). Now we have over 600 rated courses and are expanding our ratings into markets like Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Las Vegas, Palm Springs and Phoenix.<br/><br/><strong>What is Hacker’s Central?</strong><br/> To create a more unified presence as well as establish a community of like-minded golfers, we launched a community-based website called Hacker’s Central (<a href=""http://www.hackerscentralonline.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hackerscentralonline.com</a>) in 2010. This website brings together our golf course directory, ratings, reviews, photos, coupons, a contributor’s network, and storefront. We expect our directory to have over 4,500 courses, over 800 reviews and expect to more than double our website traffic in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Mobile Golfer?</strong><br/> This is going to be our way to combine everything we’ve done to date by leveraging the power of mobile. In addition to everything that Hacker’s Guide currently brings to the table, we intend to build a suite of cool golf apps under the Mobile Golfer umbrella. A directory, review site, scorecard, tee time reservation, social media integration, USGA handicap tracker, 3rd party GPS and more – it will do everything for a golfer except swing the club (see <strong><em>Functions Chart</em></strong> in the gallery).<br/><br/><strong>Who is Bruce Stasch?</strong><br/> He is the founder and publisher of the Hacker’s Guide. He has been a blogger, a podcaster, an e-commerce website entrepreneur, a web advertising agency owner and he is also what he writes about…a hacker (golf that is). <br/><br/><strong>What will we use the money for?</strong><br/> We intend to use the proceeds from this funding effort to build and launch Version 1.0 of the Mobile Golfer. We have established a relationship with a mobile developer who will help us complete the beta-test version for both the iPhone and Android platforms. We expect to have a mobile version of our course directory, the course reviews and ratings, the ability to have golfers add their ratings and reviews, USGA handicap tracking, social media integration and our dynamic scorecard built within version 1.0 when it launches January, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help?</strong><br/> Although we’ve been in the golf industry building websites and rating courses since 2007, we have not moved into the mobile space….yet. For those of you who are golfers, techies, mobile geeks or just like to support a cool idea, we need you. We can’t do it alone.</p>
<p>It is true that we need your contribution, but we also need you to provide feedback. We want you to contribute so that you can be part of our beta-testing team and help us put our mobile app through its paces. We won’t launch anything that is second-rate and we want our testers to be active users of our technology.  You don’t have to be a golfer to appreciate and comment on good design.</p>
<p><strong>What's this about custom-built golf clubs?</strong><br/> For certain donation levels we will make you a custom-built golf club. We are able to do that because we have had relationships with wholesale suppliers of golf components for the last decade and we are able to assemble golf clubs based on how a contributor would want them. They can be almost anything you'd want in your bag from a putter to a full set of irons. What we would build for you is dependent upon what level your decide to participate. After you've decided to donate, we will contact you to get your specifications for the club you want. It typically takes 7-10 days for delivery. Additional international delivery charges are noted in the right column.</p>
<p><strong>Who is in your video?</strong><br/> We shot our video at Stonebrooke Golf Club, in Shakopee, Minnesota. It is a public golf course located in the southwestern part of the Twin Cities and they generously allowed us to run around their course, terrorizing their staff and thoroughly making a pest of ourselves all in the interest of our “art”.  Bob was played by Josh Will, a local actor and certified golf hacker. Nick Sweeney, Jeremy Doyle and Mary Doody were his golfing buddies. The man behind the camera was Aaron Gelperin, from <a href=""http://w-angle.com/#home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wide Angle Studios</a>. He’s a great video producer attested by the fact that he made even me look good on camera (I think).</p></div>","Our Story We're a group of golfers who started out with a website dedicated to providing quality golf equipment at prices ordinary golfers could afford. As we heard from thousands of our customers, it became apparent that what they really needed (and was completely absent) was a way to rate golf courses that ordinary golfers could use and make smart decisions, unlike current guides (the Hacker's Guide).
With the mobile revolution, we realized we could provide both equipment retailing and ratings, as well as many more tools, in a unique and intuitive fashion through the smartphone. With this ""secret weapon"" we could make golf more accessible to amateur golfers by taking all of the time & hassle - and more than a little of the expense - out of finding a course, making a tee time and enjoying golf! That was the intellectual birth of the Mobile Golfer.The Problem You’d think with over 650,000 apps in the Apple App Store and almost as many for the Android, you’d have already found the perfect app for a golfer. Yes, there are a number of apps out there, but most perform only one or two functions and then not very intuitively. Rather than making the golf experience better, they are inelegant and don't efficiently do the things you want them to do. They get downloaded once and then never used again. Ugh! Mobile devices are designed to empower users, not just put a screen and virtual buttons where paper, pencil and phone used to be.
Today, in order to get golfing, the typical golfer often has six or more apps open and none of the information is shared between them. Something as simple as taking the name of the golf course and dropping it into a scorecard automatically doesn’t happen. Can you say 'integration'? And where is the ability to send a simple invitation to friends? It doesn't exist in current apps.
Our Solution So we asked the question “can we make an app that combines all of these golf functions into one golf tool?”  Our tech team said “h*ll yeah!” so we decided to build the Mobile Golfer – the app that does everything for a golfer except swing the club.Here’s How it Works Simplicity of design is essential, just as Steve Jobs envisioned. The very best features in the Mobile Golfer are the services performed in the background, enabling the golfer to spend time golfing instead of ordering, organizing and administering. Ever try to put together a simple foursome and match everyone's schedule to available tee times? It's nearly impossible and way too time consuming. Remember we talked about simplicity? One click fires up the Mobile Golfer. Right in front of you are a series of functions…directory, scorecard, online tee time booking, etc. Each is integrated with the other. A course selected from the directory is used to make a tee time, populate the score card, register a USGA handicap and so on. The same data is shared across functions. You only have to launch one app. View the Functions Chart in the gallery.
Donation Levels Our development team wants you to be involved from the beginning and help us create a great app. We also want to provide you with golf stuff that you can use right away as you are waiting for the beta and subsequently, Version 1.0. We've created a chart that shows what you should expect dependent upon what level you decide to participate. It corresponds to the level listed on the right column (see Contributors Chart in the gallery).
Why We Need You We can't do this alone. We've been planning, designing and specifying this app for much of the year. We've been talking to third parties getting them to agree to integrate their functions into our app. We've been building our database of golf course information and ratings to make it the best out there, but we can't begin to code without you and your support.
If you are a golfer, a techie, a philanthropist or you just like cool ideas, we think you'll appreciate what we are doing.
Thank you in advance for your support!

FAQs
What is the Hacker’s Guide? The Hacker’s Guide (www.hackersguides.com) was started in 2007 to rate golf courses for the typical golfer (the ‘hacker’) who shoots over 90 on eighteen holes (that’s actually 78% of us according to the National Golf Foundation). In 2008 we rated 87 courses in the Twin Cities with our first book (the Hacker’s Guide to Twin Cities Golf Courses), in 2009 we expanded our footprint by rating 283 public courses in Minnesota and western Wisconsin (the Hacker's Guide to Minnesota & Western Wisconsin Golf Courses) and in our third season rated over 500 courses in the 5-state Upper Midwest region (MN, WI, IA, ND & SD). Now we have over 600 rated courses and are expanding our ratings into markets like Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Las Vegas, Palm Springs and Phoenix.What is Hacker’s Central? To create a more unified presence as well as establish a community of like-minded golfers, we launched a community-based website called Hacker’s Central (www.hackerscentralonline.com) in 2010. This website brings together our golf course directory, ratings, reviews, photos, coupons, a contributor’s network, and storefront. We expect our directory to have over 4,500 courses, over 800 reviews and expect to more than double our website traffic in 2012.
What is the Mobile Golfer? This is going to be our way to combine everything we’ve done to date by leveraging the power of mobile. In addition to everything that Hacker’s Guide currently brings to the table, we intend to build a suite of cool golf apps under the Mobile Golfer umbrella. A directory, review site, scorecard, tee time reservation, social media integration, USGA handicap tracker, 3rd party GPS and more – it will do everything for a golfer except swing the club (see Functions Chart in the gallery).Who is Bruce Stasch? He is the founder and publisher of the Hacker’s Guide. He has been a blogger, a podcaster, an e-commerce website entrepreneur, a web advertising agency owner and he is also what he writes about…a hacker (golf that is). What will we use the money for? We intend to use the proceeds from this funding effort to build and launch Version 1.0 of the Mobile Golfer. We have established a relationship with a mobile developer who will help us complete the beta-test version for both the iPhone and Android platforms. We expect to have a mobile version of our course directory, the course reviews and ratings, the ability to have golfers add their ratings and reviews, USGA handicap tracking, social media integration and our dynamic scorecard built within version 1.0 when it launches January, 2013.
Why we need your help? Although we’ve been in the golf industry building websites and rating courses since 2007, we have not moved into the mobile space….yet. For those of you who are golfers, techies, mobile geeks or just like to support a cool idea, we need you. We can’t do it alone.
It is true that we need your contribution, but we also need you to provide feedback. We want you to contribute so that you can be part of our beta-testing team and help us put our mobile app through its paces. We won’t launch anything that is second-rate and we want our testers to be active users of our technology.  You don’t have to be a golfer to appreciate and comment on good design.
What's this about custom-built golf clubs? For certain donation levels we will make you a custom-built golf club. We are able to do that because we have had relationships with wholesale suppliers of golf components for the last decade and we are able to assemble golf clubs based on how a contributor would want them. They can be almost anything you'd want in your bag from a putter to a full set of irons. What we would build for you is dependent upon what level your decide to participate. After you've decided to donate, we will contact you to get your specifications for the club you want. It typically takes 7-10 days for delivery. Additional international delivery charges are noted in the right column.
Who is in your video? We shot our video at Stonebrooke Golf Club, in Shakopee, Minnesota. It is a public golf course located in the southwestern part of the Twin Cities and they generously allowed us to run around their course, terrorizing their staff and thoroughly making a pest of ourselves all in the interest of our “art”.  Bob was played by Josh Will, a local actor and certified golf hacker. Nick Sweeney, Jeremy Doyle and Mary Doody were his golfing buddies. The man behind the camera was Aaron Gelperin, from Wide Angle Studios. He’s a great video producer attested by the fact that he made even me look good on camera (I think).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div class=""full-description"">
<p><strong>1) Our Screen Structure is 17 Years Old and Needs an Upgrade. </strong>Father Time and those awesome windstorms we have in Boulder do a lot of damage to the overall screen frame, most especially to the joints, and while we've been vigilant about getting it repaired every season, there's a better way to do this.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/399/221/a1118ca572bcdeea2da7ddc640ee9094_large.jpg?1361396465"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>2) The Smartest Way for Us to Upgrade is to Get an Inflatable Screen.</strong> The inflatable screen doesn't require a large metal frame, it only needs spots to be tethered to. Plus, if we can tear down the current structure, the area will look nicer, benefitting the entire neighborhood. </p>
<p><strong>3) An Inflatable Screen Protects Boulder Outdoor Cinema's Future.</strong> If our current space ever goes away, we can simply move the BOC to a park or somewhere else in town. This also gives us the option of growing the BOC. We could take that new screen lots of places: community parks, company picnics, fundraising events, you name it. That kind of mobility will keep us vital for the NEXT 17 years.</p>
<p><strong>4) Quality Inflatable Screens are Expensive. </strong>Because we are and have always been a donation-based business serving the community of Boulder, we don’t make the kind of money necessary for this upgrade. We have worked with inflatable screens before, we know what kind we need to get and all the accessories to pull it off, such as tethers, a generator, a trailer, etc. We’ve been doing everything we can to raise the money ourselves: saving donations, digging through our couches, cleaning out our savings, squirreling away day-job paychecks and we’re about a third of the way there. We need your help to get this accomplished. </p>

<p><strong>5) It Will Be Worth It for YOU. </strong>You may have been to the Boulder Outdoor Cinema. You've probably had a swell time. Boulder Outdoor Cinema is a tradition in Boulder, it's one of those things that shows up on a Bucket List of Things to Do in Boulder in the Summer. We want to keep it going just as badly as you want it to keep being there. We believe the inflatable screen is the key to our future in Boulder - the key to generating enough revenue on our own in future years to upgrade our AV gear. Yes, we're asking you to chip in some money now. You work hard for your money (so hard for it, honey!) so we better treat you right! (Oh, that's right!) So we researched which outdoor cinema fundraising programs around the country were successful. We learned from them. And then we talked to our friends around town and learned from them. And now we have this fundraising program all planned out, with a lot of pretty awesome rewards for our backers: some of them include us taking this new inflatable screen to you so you can show a movie to 900 of your best friends. Check out the rewards and if there's nothing listed that you're into, let us know. We're pretty sure you're gonna like what you see!</p>

<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h3>
<p>After our project is successfully funded, some of the challenges we expect to face include tearing down the current structure (it's been there for almost 2 decades and we don't know what it'll take to remove it), and setting up anchors for tethering the new inflatable screen. Hopefully, those two issues can be addressed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Another challenge will be figuring out where to store the new screen. Our current screen rolls up nicely and fits in our little basement room on top of our other gear. The new screen will need to be stored on a large rolling dolly and won't fit in our current space, so we'll have to find an appropriate place to keep it as well as figure out how to transport it back and forth to the BOC. These problems are not insurmountable and we're feeling confident we'll overcome them.</p>
<p>Our biggest concern is not getting funded. Our current business model keeps the BOC on the edge of financed, but there is no income for upgrading our gear. If we get the screen and can do a few off-site shows a year, that income will make the BOC safer financially and may mean we can stop throwing our paychecks at the business to keep it afloat. <br/><br/>If we don't succeed with this plan, we'll keep doing our best producing shows for the Boulder community this summer and come up with another plan to rebuild. But we're sticking with one of Walter Sobchak's most inspirational quotes (that he ripped off from Theodore Herzl): IF YOU WILL IT, DUDE, IT IS NO DREAM</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Wencoglobal has been in the electronics business for over 15 years.  This is a personal project of mine that I believe will be relevant to many people that use the iPhone or Android smartphones just like me.  Imagine being in your car and you are playing your music through your iPhone or Android smartphone: how do you change songs? How do you play/pause? How do you activate Siri to help you find something?  Unless your car is new and has the bluetooth functions built-in, it's not easy to power on the screen, swipe to unlock (or enter a password), and do these things.</p>
<p>If you play your music from your smartphone and you don't have bluetooth connectivity in your car, this is the best way to control your smartphone.  You will never settle for anything less.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$7000 will go towards tooling up the plastic shell and buttons</p>
<p>$15000 will go towards buying components such as battery and pcba and bluetooth modules.</p>
<p>$8000 will go towards assembly, packaging, and shipping.</p>
<p>There is no bluetooth remote this small that can fit your pocket, car, or home.</p>
<p>If the goal is not reached by the target date, I will contribute the remainder myself to make sure each backer gets a remote.</p>
<p>For each supporter, you will get 1 remote in full packaging delivered to your address.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping with this campaign, we can show the major electronics brands that we, the consumers, can come up with innovative products and not pay outrageous prices for it.  We can change our own lives.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please let me know if you are willing to be a beta tester for any of our upcoming products.  If you can do design, perhaps you can even help create the packaging and manuals.  </p>

If you play your music from your smartphone and you don't have bluetooth connectivity in your car, this is the best way to control your smartphone.  You will never settle for anything less.


What We Need & What You Get
$7000 will go towards tooling up the plastic shell and buttons
$15000 will go towards buying components such as battery and pcba and bluetooth modules.
$8000 will go towards assembly, packaging, and shipping.
There is no bluetooth remote this small that can fit your pocket, car, or home.
If the goal is not reached by the target date, I will contribute the remainder myself to make sure each backer gets a remote.
For each supporter, you will get 1 remote in full packaging delivered to your address.


The Impact
By helping with this campaign, we can show the major electronics brands that we, the consumers, can come up with innovative products and not pay outrageous prices for it.  We can change our own lives.


Other Ways You Can Help
Please let me know if you are willing to be a beta tester for any of our upcoming products.  If you can do design, perhaps you can even help create the packaging and manuals.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Rewards for backers
Now we need your help :) We are raising funds to launch BleepBleeps and make our products a reality.
Making hardware is hard! First of all we have to design the product and build the smartphone app. Then we have to source and pay for all the different components inside Sammy like the accelerometer and Bluetooth unit, the battery, the speaker. And we have to design and make our own unique printed circuit board to connect all the components. Then we have to work with a manufacturer to produce the very expensive tooling to make the plastic case. Then everything has to be assembled, shipped to BleepBleeps, tested and finally shipped to you. A complicated and expensive business. We've tried to be as fair as we can with rewards below. It's important to us that our backers pay a reasonable price.
We've included free worldwide shipping on all rewards!












Sammy Screamer is the first device created by BleepBleeps.

<h3><b>FAQs</b></h3>
<b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Q: My earphone does not have an embedded microphone. Can I still make a phone call after plugging my earbud cable into the device</span>
</b><p><b>A.</b> You are unable to make phone calls if you connect ASOME to an earbud with no Bluetooth receiver with microphone. This case your smartphone will ring when receiving incoming phone call.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Q. Does ASOME have a built-in microphone?</b></span></p>
<p><b>A. </b>Bluetooth receiver does not have an embedded microphone but earbud included in our product package does. In order to make phone call, you need to use earbud with embedded microphone.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Q. How long is the device warranty period?</b></span></p>
<p><b>A.</b> We offer one year warranty ONLY covering manufacturing defect and workmanship </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Q. I want to plug my smartphone earbud into ASOME. Is my ASOME compatible with the inline remote?</b></span></p>
<p><b>A.</b> ASOME is compatible with some Android earbuds (Ex. LG Quadbeat, Samsung). However, only the call button works with the Apple EarPod.  </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Q. Is the product waterproof?</b></span></p>
<p><b>A. </b>Unfortunately ASOME is neither waterproof nor water-resistant. So please be careful with water and if the product gets wet: </p>
<p>1) wipe the product out with linen 2) turn the power off 3) restart the product. </p>
<p>Please be aware of using handdryer because the heat over 60 degrees can cause damage to the the exterior material of the Product.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Q. Is ASOME compatible with other device?</b></span></p>
<p><b>A. </b>Any device with latest bluetooth 4.1 standard is compatible with Asome</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Q. Howcome I hear a white noise when I play music with low volume?</b></span></p>
<p><b>A. </b>impedance varies with the type of earbud you use and can cause the white noise. ASOME bluetooth receiver has passed qualification assurance tests with smarphone makers such as Apple, Samsung, and LG to optimize sound quality.

ASOME In The News



Features

We wanted to bring a product that people use in daily
life and is faithful to the basics. We designed ASOME, a bluetooth engine, to be simple, high performance, and truly wearable. 



Simple and Easy to Use









ASOME is easy to use. 
Simply plug in,




One click,

And then enjoy your music.


High Performance








ASOME is only 14.1 gram but still guarantees high performance. 

While designing the product with minimal elements, we built a product that does not compromise quality over design. 

ASOME includes a Qualcomm aptX chipset and a 210mAh battery, which delivers high quality sound for 10 hours of battery life.
ASOME also has a multi-pairing feature via Bluetooth 4.1, so you can connect two devices simultaneously.


Truly Wearable





ASOME can be worn just about anywhere.

Wear ASOME with various accessories and coordinate your
fashion.
You can wear ASOME as a necklace, clip it on your shirt, armband, or
pocket, or hook it on your bag or belt loop.


ASOME in your daily life
In the gym 




In the office 





At house parties





Specifications






We need your help 

Different from other hardware projects on Indiegogo, we’ve solved all the development and manufacturing issues with ASOME.  We only have two tasks to solve at this point:
1. Successfully finish the campaign with your support 
2. Begin manufacturing with Indiegogo funds and deliver ASOME to you right after the campaign ends.

FAQs
Q: My earphone does not have an embedded microphone. Can I still make a phone call after plugging my earbud cable into the device
A. You are unable to make phone calls if you connect ASOME to an earbud with no Bluetooth receiver with microphone. This case your smartphone will ring when receiving incoming phone call.

Q. Does ASOME have a built-in microphone?
A. Bluetooth receiver does not have an embedded microphone but earbud included in our product package does. In order to make phone call, you need to use earbud with embedded microphone.

Q. How long is the device warranty period?
A. We offer one year warranty ONLY covering manufacturing defect and workmanship 

Q. I want to plug my smartphone earbud into ASOME. Is my ASOME compatible with the inline remote?
A. ASOME is compatible with some Android earbuds (Ex. LG Quadbeat, Samsung). However, only the call button works with the Apple EarPod.  

Q. Is the product waterproof?
A. Unfortunately ASOME is neither waterproof nor water-resistant. So please be careful with water and if the product gets wet: 
1) wipe the product out with linen 2) turn the power off 3) restart the product. 
Please be aware of using handdryer because the heat over 60 degrees can cause damage to the the exterior material of the Product.

Q. Is ASOME compatible with other device?
A. Any device with latest bluetooth 4.1 standard is compatible with Asome

Q. Howcome I hear a white noise when I play music with low volume?
A. impedance varies with the type of earbud you use and can cause the white noise. ASOME bluetooth receiver has passed qualification assurance tests with smarphone makers such as Apple, Samsung, and LG to optimize sound quality. The sound is not guarenteed and could be differnet from the original sound when playing other maker's earbuds. 

Q. What color options are available?A. Dark gray, White are available. If total funds raised exceed $100,000, Khaki can be  available.",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Welcome to privacy, welcome to INCO.GNI.TO !</h3>
<p>As the video illustrates, we are currently developing an encrypted Wi-Fi application for making peer-to-peer calls on smartphones (and, eventually, a standalone device). In addition, <b><i>our code will be 100% open source</i></b> for community inspection and auditing.</p>

<h3>How in the world is this possible?</h3>
<p>For the most part, the same technology used to secure important governmental secrets or corporate trade secrets is very much available to the average person. However, the average individual lacks the time, knowledge, expertise, resources, etc., to apply this information security technology to our personal or professional lives. It's all there already, we just need to put it together correctly.</p>

<h3>How are you different than others?</h3>
<p>Almost all present secure communications systems were designed prior to the recent disclosures that have revealed intrusion at levels not previously considered (except by the most paranoid). Incognito aims to make the most secure communications platform, without making any assumptions on the security of any part of the ecosystem in which it operates including the hardware, firmware, operating system and the network infrastructure.

<p>We certainly are not recreating the wheel, we're putting together the pieces so you have a chance to use the wheel... currently, you don't. Encrypted VoIP services popped up over a decade ago, including both commercial and open source services. Some of the encrypted VoIP services had some flaws and none of them provided the ease of use demanded by the general public... that's what we're doing! We are smashing together the relevant technology, adapting to your way of life and at the same time providing the mechanisms for the secure communication you deserve.</p>

<p>It's a good point, but you'd be surprised how effective encryption is. If you want the real ""techy"" stuff, check the bottom of this page.

<p>Sure, I will discuss some security and networking features of incognito, along with a basic diagram of an incognito session. In addition, we've uploaded some comparison charts <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/freedom-phone-application-protecting-your-privacy/x/4217668?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Every contact as well as every peer in the Incognito network will have a strong identity based on an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EC-DSA) identity, and will be validated before communication begins.</p>
<p>All data pertaining to your communication (voice/video/text) will be encrypted both at the session level as well as at the transport layer. The transport layer between each peer pair will use TLS encryption. The communications sessions will be encrypted with full 256 bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Encryption and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (EC-DH) will be used for secure key exchange.</p>
<p>Further, we will use various other security techniques including padding messages into larger packets inter-mixed with noise, prior to encryption.</p>
<p>Incognito will use Wi-Fi to connect to the internetwork. It will never use GSM/CDMA/telephony networks as these networks can easily track the identity and location of a device. Where multiple Wi-Fi networks are available, Incognito can scatter session packets across multiple networks so that it is difficult to capture the sequence of session data packets at an infrastructure routing point.</p>
<p>Incognito will use a purely peer to peer network with no centralized servers, whatsoever. We will use a modified, highly secure adaptation of the DHT (Distributed Hash Table) peering technology for building its data communications network.</p>
<p>We will also introduce novel, advanced routing and tunneling technology that would make it statistically impossible for recording the session (already encrypted ) at a router or intermediary peer. Some of these techniques include breaking encrypted data buffers into smaller packets and scattering the packets across multiple networks and peer tunnels where available. This means collecting and assembling packets of your communications by a third party for carrying out brute force attacks later, will be made very difficult if not impossible. Optional facility to tunnel communications through random peers will enable masking of the originating peer.</p>

Our information is neither safe nor private, especially considering identity theft, corporate espionage, government surveillance, etc. Unfortunately, as individuals, there is very little we can do about it; politically or technologically.

Welcome to privacy, welcome to INCO.GNI.TO !
As the video illustrates, we are currently developing an encrypted Wi-Fi application for making peer-to-peer calls on smartphones (and, eventually, a standalone device). In addition, our code will be 100% open source for community inspection and auditing.


How in the world is this possible?
For the most part, the same technology used to secure important governmental secrets or corporate trade secrets is very much available to the average person. However, the average individual lacks the time, knowledge, expertise, resources, etc., to apply this information security technology to our personal or professional lives. It's all there already, we just need to put it together correctly.


How are you different than others?
Almost all present secure communications systems were designed prior to the recent disclosures that have revealed intrusion at levels not previously considered (except by the most paranoid). Incognito aims to make the most secure communications platform, without making any assumptions on the security of any part of the ecosystem in which it operates including the hardware, firmware, operating system and the network infrastructure. Compare us:



Encrypted Application Comparison

Identification and Information Leakage
Other Vulnerabilities


If the technology is “there already”, what exactly are you doing?
We certainly are not recreating the wheel, we're putting together the pieces so you have a chance to use the wheel... currently, you don't. Encrypted VoIP services popped up over a decade ago, including both commercial and open source services. Some of the encrypted VoIP services had some flaws and none of them provided the ease of use demanded by the general public... that's what we're doing! We are smashing together the relevant technology, adapting to your way of life and at the same time providing the mechanisms for the secure communication you deserve.

How could you actually secure communication when the NSA's budget is larger than the GDP of other Countries?
It's a good point, but you'd be surprised how effective encryption is. If you want the real ""techy"" stuff, check the bottom of this page. If you want the basics, search the internet for articles about how frustrated spy agencies have become with the rising use of encryption.

<p></p>
<p>One of the biggest problems with current E-Cigarettes/Personal Vaporizers is that they have become another device to have to carry around that are not as easy to come across as a conventional cigarette.</p>
<p>They may also die on you without a warning, leaving you craving just one more puff.</p>
<p> Worst of all if you lose an E-Cigarette/Personal Vaporizer its a major expense you may not want to afford and may turn you back to cigarettes.</p>
<p>Our competitors seem to only be creating heavier and bulkier E-Cigarette/Personal Vaporizers to be able to store bigger batteries to ensure it lasts the entire day.</p>

ELITE DAILY

BEST CROWDFUNDING-WEBSITES

As mankind leaves tobacco behind, they are looking for an alternative to turn to that can help them kick their nicotine addiction, but give them the same sensation that cigarettes do. E-Cigarettes/Personal Vaporizers have become the new/best alternative to smoking. 

One of the biggest problems with current E-Cigarettes/Personal Vaporizers is that they have become another device to have to carry around that are not as easy to come across as a conventional cigarette.
They may also die on you without a warning, leaving you craving just one more puff.
 Worst of all if you lose an E-Cigarette/Personal Vaporizer its a major expense you may not want to afford and may turn you back to cigarettes.
Our competitors seem to only be creating heavier and bulkier E-Cigarette/Personal Vaporizers to be able to store bigger batteries to ensure it lasts the entire day.
We hope to be the solution to all of these problems with The VQase.















It is our mission to
provide the most convenient vaping experience. We will provide you with the new

<h3>We are Multiple Score-Gasm!</h3>
<p>Don't let the silly name fool you, most the members of MS-G are actually young degreed engineers. Hailing from various engineering disciplines and with trained/untrained professionals we WILL qualify for the Red Bull Creation contest. We are looking for residents of Long Island and NYC that want to see a group of highly motivated Long Islanders take home the trophy and bring a fun, innovative, and interactive light display to Long Island and NYC..... Take that New Jersey!</p>
<p>Founding Team Members:</p>
<p>Philip Haasnoot - Team Captain (BSME)<br/>Michael Palazzolo - Twin 1 (BSME)<br/>Chris Palazzolo - Twin 2 (Aircraft Mechanic, HVAC Expert)<br/>Craig Morgan - Muscle Car Maniac (BSME)<br/>William Davis - Resident Hipster (BSME)</p>
<p>Supporting Team Members:</p>
<p>Anthony Tricarichi - Team Pirate (BSEE)<br/>Vin Calandrino - Drops the Bass (BSME)<br/><br/></p>
<p>The list is growing!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding, we only have a few short weeks to get this project off the ground and we need YOUR help to make this possible. We are looking for funds to break even on one events that will be held on LI (Location TBD). The events will be recorded and turned into a short film for submission to the Red Bull Creation contest committee. </p>
<p>We are builing an interactive light display that will accomodate 32 players, players will compete in three 5 minute games of intense light-displaying action; after which 32 more players will rotate in so we can accomodate everyone. We are planning to have a introductory BBQ and explain the game, as well as test the equipment and get everyone suited up; once the sun goes down the real fun begins!</p>
<p>What you get depends on what you give, most of the donors will be invited to take part in the food and drink portion of the festivities, higher level donors will get the chance to actually get into a suit and participate in a once-in-a-lifetime interactive display of lights and sweat.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates at the spectator level will have a chance to participate in the installation after all the higher tiers have had their chance; however due to time and venue restrictions we cannot make promises for this tier.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm going to keep this short, we want to win.... the more funding this project recieves the more successful it will be. We aren't looking to make a profit, we are looking to get enough funding to get our ideas into reality and really steal the show. Success in this competition will mean a lot for the future of our group, as I am sure this wont be our last competition together. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share with all your friends and also help us find sponsors!! If you know of anyone who you think can be of assistance please feel free to call our team captain Philip Haasnoot (516.528.8517). Equipment loans, discounts, anything and everything helps so please feel free to reach out. </p>

We are Multiple Score-Gasm!
Don't let the silly name fool you, most the members of MS-G are actually young degreed engineers. Hailing from various engineering disciplines and with trained/untrained professionals we WILL qualify for the Red Bull Creation contest. We are looking for residents of Long Island and NYC that want to see a group of highly motivated Long Islanders take home the trophy and bring a fun, innovative, and interactive light display to Long Island and NYC..... Take that New Jersey!
Founding Team Members:
Philip Haasnoot - Team Captain (BSME)Michael Palazzolo - Twin 1 (BSME)Chris Palazzolo - Twin 2 (Aircraft Mechanic, HVAC Expert)Craig Morgan - Muscle Car Maniac (BSME)William Davis - Resident Hipster (BSME)
Supporting Team Members:
Anthony Tricarichi - Team Pirate (BSEE)Vin Calandrino - Drops the Bass (BSME)
The list is growing!
 


What We Need & What You Get
We need funding, we only have a few short weeks to get this project off the ground and we need YOUR help to make this possible. We are looking for funds to break even on one events that will be held on LI (Location TBD). The events will be recorded and turned into a short film for submission to the Red Bull Creation contest committee. 
We are builing an interactive light display that will accomodate 32 players, players will compete in three 5 minute games of intense light-displaying action; after which 32 more players will rotate in so we can accomodate everyone. We are planning to have a introductory BBQ and explain the game, as well as test the equipment and get everyone suited up; once the sun goes down the real fun begins!
What you get depends on what you give, most of the donors will be invited to take part in the food and drink portion of the festivities, higher level donors will get the chance to actually get into a suit and participate in a once-in-a-lifetime interactive display of lights and sweat.
Anyone who donates at the spectator level will have a chance to participate in the installation after all the higher tiers have had their chance; however due to time and venue restrictions we cannot make promises for this tier.


The Impact
I'm going to keep this short, we want to win.... the more funding this project recieves the more successful it will be. We aren't looking to make a profit, we are looking to get enough funding to get our ideas into reality and really steal the show. Success in this competition will mean a lot for the future of our group, as I am sure this wont be our last competition together. 


Other Ways You Can Help
Share with all your friends and also help us find sponsors!! If you know of anyone who you think can be of assistance please feel free to call our team captain Philip Haasnoot (516.528.8517). Equipment loans, discounts, anything and everything helps so please feel free to reach out.

<h4>
<strong>WHAT IS THE iPOCKET™ DRIVE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(iPD)?</strong>
</h4>The iPocket™ Drive (iPD) allows you to quickly and safely move all your movies, music, documents, and files between all your devices (computers, iPhones, iPads, iTouches, Android, and Windows) with ease. No need for cellular data, Internet, wireless networks, or Cloud access when using the iPD.<div style=""text-align: justify;"">

</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<h4><strong>CONVENIENCE AND FUNCTIONALITY RIGHT OUT OF YOUR POCKET </strong></h4>Many users use a USB flash drive to transfer files from computer to computer; it’s easy, fast, and convenient. Other phones can transfer data through memory cards, but the iPhone has never had this feature since its release in 2007. Until now. At last a drive that fits all models of iPhone, iPad, iTouch, PC, MAC, Android, and Windows. What more do you need?<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1054247/files/20141128133255-iPhone-iPad-iPD-New.jpg?1417210375"" src="""" style=""""/> <br/>
<h4><strong>INTRODUCING...THE iPOCKET™ DRIVE</strong></h4>Apple iPhone users can now enjoy all the benefits of a USB hard drive with their Apple iPhone, iPad, iTouch, PC, MAC, Android, and Windows. The iPD supports most Apple iOS file types and all common file types in use today, storing everything in its fast all-flash memory. The iPD comes with everything you need to get started: An integrated Apple Lightning connector and a regular USB connector.</div>

</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<h4><strong>WHAT EXACTLY CAN IT DO?</strong></h4>With the iPD, users can move and add photos, videos, music, and other files to and from any device to their iPD. The iPD allows you to conserve space on your smartphone while also saving you money! iPhones with more storage space cost hundreds of dollars, external hard drives don't fit the iPhone, but the iPD can instantly double or triple the storage on your Apple or Android device for as little as $65.<div style=""text-align: justify;"">

</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<h4><strong>WORKS WITH MAC &amp; PC: </strong></h4>The iPD works with any Mac or PC models. With the 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB models, you can backup your entire desktop computer hard drive for easy access. Free up space on your iPhone or Android by backing up all of your photos, videos, and files to the iPD. No need to pay for recurring online Cloud storage subscriptions.</div>

</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<h4><strong>STREAM MUSIC:</strong></h4>Stop with the hassle of fitting your entire music library on your phone. The iPocket™ Drive can directly stream music for INSTANT playback on your Apple and Android devices without the lengthy process of syncing to iTunes. <div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<h4><strong>CHARGE YOUR iPHONE, iPAD, OR ANDROID PHONE</strong></h4>If all that functionality isn’t enough for you, the iPD also has the added convenience of being able to charge your iPhone, iPad, Android, or Tablet battery 100% directly from any USB outlet. Stop carrying compatible wires and chargers around— you can charge your iPhone, iPad, or iTouch directly from any USB port using the iPD.</div>

<strong><h4>SAFE AND SECURE</h4></strong> In this day and age, data breaches seem normal. Every week we see news stories of hackers breaking into our credit cards, personal information, and Cloud storage. With the iPD, you can eliminate that concern. The drive is safe and secure since zero information is sent through a third party service, transferred through the internet, or sent to the Cloud. This makes our drive perfect for conducting all matters private, personal or business related. iPD is always by your side, all your personal and private data, safe and secure, whenever you need it.</div>

WHAT IS THE iPOCKET™ DRIVE (iPD)?
The iPocket™ Drive (iPD) allows you to quickly and safely move all your movies, music, documents, and files between all your devices (computers, iPhones, iPads, iTouches, Android, and Windows) with ease. No need for cellular data, Internet, wireless networks, or Cloud access when using the iPD.




CONVENIENCE AND FUNCTIONALITY RIGHT OUT OF YOUR POCKET Many users use a USB flash drive to transfer files from computer to computer; it’s easy, fast, and convenient. Other phones can transfer data through memory cards, but the iPhone has never had this feature since its release in 2007. Until now. At last a drive that fits all models of iPhone, iPad, iTouch, PC, MAC, Android, and Windows. What more do you need?
 
INTRODUCING...THE iPOCKET™ DRIVEApple iPhone users can now enjoy all the benefits of a USB hard drive with their Apple iPhone, iPad, iTouch, PC, MAC, Android, and Windows. The iPD supports most Apple iOS file types and all common file types in use today, storing everything in its fast all-flash memory. The iPD comes with everything you need to get started: An integrated Apple Lightning connector and a regular USB connector.






WHAT EXACTLY CAN IT DO?With the iPD, users can move and add photos, videos, music, and other files to and from any device to their iPD. The iPD allows you to conserve space on your smartphone while also saving you money! iPhones with more storage space cost hundreds of dollars, external hard drives don't fit the iPhone, but the iPD can instantly double or triple the storage on your Apple or Android device for as little as $65.




WORKS WITH MAC & PC: The iPD works with any Mac or PC models. With the 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB models, you can backup your entire desktop computer hard drive for easy access. Free up space on your iPhone or Android by backing up all of your photos, videos, and files to the iPD. No need to pay for recurring online Cloud storage subscriptions.



 
STREAM MOVIES:For frequent travelers, the iPD streaming capabilities will make it an invaluable accessory. Movie files stored on it can be streamed directly for viewing on your iPhone, iPad, iTouch, Android and Windows. Now you can watch movies INSTANTLY anywhere, anytime!




STREAM MUSIC:Stop with the hassle of fitting your entire music library on your phone. The iPocket™ Drive can directly stream music for INSTANT playback on your Apple and Android devices without the lengthy process of syncing to iTunes. 




CHARGE YOUR iPHONE, iPAD, OR ANDROID PHONEIf all that functionality isn’t enough for you, the iPD also has the added convenience of being able to charge your iPhone, iPad, Android, or Tablet battery 100% directly from any USB outlet. Stop carrying compatible wires and chargers around— you can charge your iPhone, iPad, or iTouch directly from any USB port using the iPD.
 

 
FAST, POWERFUL, EASY-TO-USE APPThe first time you plug in your iPD you will be prompted to download our free app. The app requires no set-up, and you will immediately see four options: Contact Backup: Backs up all of your contacts 
Local Storage: Accesses files on your iOS, Android, and Windows devices 
External Storage: Accesses your iPocket™ Drive storage 
Dropbox: Accesses Dropbox 



ONE CLICK CONTACT BACKUPPress the Backup button and all your personal contact information is transferred immediately to the iPocket™ Drive. Not just names and phones numbers but all your complete contact information. You can then transfer them between any new device, iPhone, Android, Windows, PC, or MAC. There are no restrictions between operating systems.


 

SAFE AND SECURE In this day and age, data breaches seem normal. Every week we see news stories of hackers breaking into our credit cards, personal information, and Cloud storage. With the iPD, you can eliminate that concern. The drive is safe and secure since zero information is sent through a third party service, transferred through the internet, or sent to the Cloud. This makes our drive perfect for conducting all matters private, personal or business related. iPD is always by your side, all your personal and private data, safe and secure, whenever you need it.
It also comes in Metal!

<h3>Our Story</h3> <p>After watching my son sustain a head injury in 2010, I felt compelled to do something about it. I asked myself, if there was one product that could add protection against head injuries that could work in any sport or activity, what would it look like?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Doing Nothing is NOT an Option</h3>According to the CDC, every year there are between 1.6 and 3.8 million head injuries (including concussions) in the United States. While sports like football and hockey are top of mind, the reality is that head injuries are common across many other sports like soccer, baseball, skateboarding, basketball, BMX, etc. The bottom line is that kids and athletes are exposed to the risk throughout the year as they typically play or practice multiple sports or activities throughout the year.</div><div>
<br/><p>Recent research from the Cleveland Clinic indicates that even hits that do not result in a concussion can also lead to long term health issues. Ignoring or not doing anything to protect our kids and athletes is not an option. </p>

<p></p>
<h3>2nd Skull<sup>®</sup> Brand</h3>In order to make the coolest protective headgear in the market, we needed a strong brand identity that was memorable, descriptive, cool and elevated the overall experience for the athlete.

During the summer of 2013 I had some time to consider this question again.  I decided to look into it further and began to research what was available to protect the head and face from flash fire hazards.  During the course of my search I realized that there really wasn't anything available to protect the head and face.  There were FR balaclavas but who was going wear that unless it was extremely cold?
At this time I was pondering what type of person would be working in the oil patch and exposed to these hazards.  The image that came to mind was a young fellow, perhaps just recently graduated from high school and looking to make some big money to get a head start in life, come home and buy a house, meet a nice girl, start a family…whatever that looked like.  I know that sounds kind of corny and old fashioned but I think it resonates with a lot of people.  We like to think that we live in an enlightened society, but it’s pretty hard to meet someone if you don’t have a face.  I then began thinking about my own son, still 7 years from graduation, deciding to forego university and heading to the oil patch to make some big money.  What if he got burned?  It would be devastating!  At that moment I knew that I had to do something to help protect my son, and everyone else’s sons, or daughters, fathers, mothers, aunts or uncles. 
I began researching existing technologies and began putting the pieces together.  I knew that the system had to be passive so it wouldn't interfere with the worker’s everyday duties.  It had to be light, flexible and comfortable.  It had to be easy to put on and take off and it needed to work in all weather conditions.
What I came up with was the first version of what became the Flame Shield FX1.  It resembled a collar assembly that was worn like shoulder pads for hockey or football but without the weight or the bulk.  It had sensors to detect a high heat signature and CO2 canisters to rapidly inflate an FR fabric to surround the head and face of the worker.
By December 2013 I had enough drawings, sketches, diagrams and descriptions of my idea to apply for a patent.  In the spring of 2014 I applied for and received dollar matching funding from the National Research Council for the R & D portion of this project.  I hired an excellent engineering team who in turn brought in an excellent industrial designer and a great soft goods expert.  Through numerous design modifications and extensive testing we achieved proof of concept of my idea in March 2015.  We were able to prove that this device would work, will work…it works!

Well, after visiting all those institutions, we found out that a <b>shocking 5 of the 46 schools that we visited, had an understanding of electronics.</b>.. but these were only technical schools! We then investigated the reasons why these learners are not learning about electronics or even robotics, despite living in an age where t<b>echnology is changing at a rapid rate.</b> The core reason was that the teachers themselves do NOT understand how they work, and neither do they posses a degree in engineering or computer science.

Now Featuring on I4U News!About ButtonDuino
ButtonDuino is TINY!  At less than 18.64 mm x 18.25 mm (0.73in x 0.718in), Buttonduino is smaller than a quarter but still packs the power of the Arduino platform. It is small enough to be placed in any project. 

ButtonDuino is USB Powered and Programmable!  No need for those FTDI boards or IC's, USB programming is now integrated into the bootloader, this makes Buttonduino cost effective and programmable anywhere!  

ButtonDuino is Breadboard Mountable! No more messy wires to your breadboard like other tiny arduinos, Buttonduino is breadboard compatible, so it plugs, with no pin conflict, directly into any standard pitch (2.54mm) breadboard as well as vero-board. This makes it cleaner and perfect for prototyping. 

ButtonDuino is Stackable! Buttonduino can be stacked with any Buttonduino compatible ButtonShields (Coming Soon). Need more pins? No problem, Buttonduino can be expanded, via I2C or SPI. Need an SD card module or even wifi, then just stack it and program! Viola, no need to for hours of hardware debugging, Buttonduino gets you up and running in seconds.

ButtonDuino is Cheap! Most enthusiasts would love to leave their beloved Arduino boards in their projects if it wasn't for the price tag and size of the boards. ButtonDuino is cheap enough to pop into any project or swapped from one project to another. No need for PCB redesign. Dirt cheap but still excellent quality.
ButtonDuino Can Interface directly to NI LabVIEW! Create amazing Graphical User Interfaces using LabVIEW by National Instruments. All you need is the same micro-USB cable that you already have to program and power ButtonDuino.
ButtonDuino is Open-Source and Arduino Compatible! Best feature is that that ButtonDuino's schematics, code and bootloaders are all FREE and Open-Source. All the details will be released once the product is finalized.                  Our GoalLumina Inova set out on a journey around  South Africa, visiting just over 46 schools and colleges. We wanted the answer to the fundamental question, ""How many students know how to program a microcontroller or have a basic understanding of electronics?"". Well, after visiting all those institutions, we found out that a shocking 5 of the 46 schools that we visited, had an understanding of electronics... but these were only technical schools! We then investigated the reasons why these learners are not learning about electronics or even robotics, despite living in an age where technology is changing at a rapid rate. The core reason was that the teachers themselves do NOT understand how they work, and neither do they posses a degree in engineering or computer science. The last reason was that electronic development kits are so damn expensive that it would be impractical to give each student one to play and learn with. This made us ask ourselves how to make a development kit that is not only affordable but also teacher and student user-friendly. The  solution came to us when we thought of creating a tiny development kit that packs the easy to program Power of Arduino. After many months of development, the ButtonDuino was born. Now with your support we aim to introduce this Open-Source Platform to those same schools and show them how important electronics are in this day and age. Not only will it help develop society, but it will also improve the advancement of product development, which would make our tomorrow a better one. The biggest successes begin with something small. And so this journey to changing the world starts with our tiny ButtonDuino, along with your support.

Development of ButtonDuinoTake us take you on the progress of ButtonDuino:

The schematic and PCB design was planned carefully to ensure that ButtonDuino is safe and practical.             

The next step was to get the Printed Circuit Boards manufactured. This process involved getting the best quote and reviewing the quality of their boards. 
The boards were then populated and went through initial testing. The first test obviously being a simple LED blink and LED fade.



SUCCESS!!
Okay! So Whats Left to Do... And how you can Help?As enthusiastic as we are about ButtonDuino, there are still a few things to be done before it can launch ButtonDuino to the world.
We need to organized the packaging and source all the components for mass production
We need to create ButtonShields (Discussed in the next section)
Create an online store where ButtonDuinos can be sold and distributed easily and quickly. 
Organize the Pick-and-Place assembly for ButtonDuino.                          

   AND THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN! The designs are now well proven out and ready for production. Our production army has been selected for PCB manufacturing .With your support, we'll be able to ramp up to production of these boards and to get them out to all those innovators worldwide. Your contribution will help to fund:

Sourcing better Tools for prototyping, production and quality testing

<p>Short Summary<br/><br/>ZUST is the most popular Day-Z sanctuary (private hive) server currently running.

<p>we just upgraded our server! its now an 8 core with HT (meaning 16 virtual cores!) 8gb of ram and almost 1gbps connection!</p>
<p><br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>Realisticly, all we need is one months worth of funding, which is $360. ($169 for the server and $200 to hire 3 full time RDC admins) however, the more we collect, the better this server will become. more money means more slots, better uptime and less lag</p>
<p><br/>QUIRKS INCLUDE WEAPONS AND VEHICLES! depending on how much you donate, the owner of the server can give you weapons, and other items. if you donate a lot, we can even give you a helicopter permenantly!<br/>If we do not reach our goal of $260, the funds will be allocated to the next possible server restart stage. if its a few months away, this will aid in helping the server come back to life as much as possible.</p>
<p><br/>The Impact<br/>If ZUST gets shut down, players all across the world will lose their progress, vehicles and weapons. WE CANT LET THIS HAPPEN!<br/>Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).<br/>Krauterz, the owner of the server, assures us that with proper funding, and with a goal that is met, not only could the server stay up indefinitly, but he could double the slot count. increase performance and add more perks to the game.</p>

As a part of my battle-gear, required for all of these events, was a hydration system such as a ""CamelBak."" It was a very convenient source of water and worked well, but the maintenance required to keep it working properly took a lot of time. This was a CONSTANT source of irritation for me, so I decided to do something about it. Thus I invented the ""Pop N' Drop Hydration System."" It basically consists of a plastic bladder similar to that of the popular ""CapriSun"" drinks, only scaled and shaped to fit inside a hydration system such as a ""CamelBak,"" and recyclable. I also re-engineered the hose/straw attachment system as illustrated in the video to make storing, using, and replacing the bladder quick and easy. With this system you can have multiple ""back-ups"" in storage, rapidly replace empties, drink whichever beverage you choose (from those made available by the associated beverage company, of course), and NEVER have to clean the reservoir again!</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $17,000 to cover the costs of a provisional patent, development of my prototype into a marketable product design, and presentation of the idea to potential beverage distributors for implementation. I have selected a company called Davison Inc. in Pennsylvania which is willing to fine-tune, beautify, and tenaciously pitch my idea to a group of corporations until someone buys it. They have state of the art machine/electronic shops, as well as numerous design teams, and will use their resources to nurture my invention from baby idea to full-fledged product. The catch is that, unless I want to pay them a large percentage of my profits forever (which I certainly do not) their fees for the use of their facilities and the employ of their representatives are ... shall we say ... steep. Every penny gained from this project, whether I reach my goal or not, will be divided between providing the promised perks for those who help to make this happen, and paying the design costs (in that order).</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">This project is very, very significant for me because it touches on and addresses a significant need that I and thousands of others like me have personally felt. There are over two million Marines, Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen in the United States military; for most of these heroes, a hydration system is essential for safety and survival, whether they are deployed, or involved in a field exercise, or simply conducting daily physical training. In the life of a soldier there is very, very little free time to relax and wind down. It is infuriating, therefore, when tedious activities encroach or are imposed upon these precious few moments. The water reservoirs in the average hydration system are exactly this kind of imposition. Because they can ONLY be used to hold water, soldiers are required to carry multiple, ungainly bottles of sports beverages to balance electrolytes and refresh their energy, or risk damaging the reservoir (and make cleaning it incredibly difficult) by filling it with non-water. The “seal” on standard reservoirs is imperfect at best, and leaky at worst, so water cannot be kept in readiness for long-term because it goes rancid very quickly and can cause illness. Worse, the reservoir must be cleaned after being emptied as well as before being refilled to eliminate the build up of mildew. And, because the reservoir can contain only two liters at a time, and the recommended daily intake under average conditions is greater than two liters (on average), either the reservoir would need to be cleaned and refilled more than once every day, or the soldier would need to purchase multiple reservoirs (at $30 each) and clean them both later. These, among other inconveniences, discourage soldiers from properly hydrating with any kind of frequency. By helping fund this project, you will be helping to put a product on the market which will give soldiers back that free-time which we covet so much while eliminating at least one unnecessary stressor from a life practically defined by stress.</p>

<h2>What is the Android X?</h2>
<p>In the car industry, Formula 1 provides a commercial test bed for cutting-edge technologies. The Android X project aims to do the same for the mobile phone industry -- to provide a low-volume, high-technology platform, crowdfunded by enthusiasts and mobile computing professionals. A pioneering project that accelerates the adoption of new technologies and drives them down into the mainstream.</p>

<p>This beautifully crafted smartphone is a proving ground for the most advanced mobile technologies on the horizon, a showpiece for true mobile innovation. And at the heart of it all is convergence: connect to any monitor and this Android X phone transforms into an Windows 10 PC, with a fully integrated desktop OS and shared access to all files. We’re fascinated by converged computing, the idea that the smartphone in your pocket can also be the brain of the PC on your desk. We’ve shaped the Android X so you can transition seamlessly between the two environments. Now all that’s needed is a phone that’s designed from the ground up to be a PC as well. The Android X is our very own superphone, a catalyst to drive the next generation of personal computing.</p>
<h2>The Hardware</h2>
<p>We’ve scoured the research labs of the biggest companies and most exciting startups for the latest and greatest mobile technologies to specify the first-generation X. Crafted from cool, textured titanium metal, the Android X has a distinctive, and very precise look. Gestures are the next big thing in mobile, and our testing has found that a 4.7in screen is ideal for comfortable control of all four corners with one hand.</p>

<p>We also believe the race for ever higher resolution has become a distraction. Beyond 400ppi you’re adding overhead rather than improving display clarity. We think color, brightness and dynamic range are now the edge of invention so we’ll choose a display for its balance of resolution, dynamic range and colour accuracy. We’ll protect that gorgeous display with something vastly tougher than glass: pure sapphire crystal, a material so hard only diamond could scratch it. For a phone to run a full desktop OS, it must have the raw power of a PC. We’ll choose the fastest available multi-core processor, at least 16GB of RAM and a massive 500GB of storage. The battery will use silicon-anode technology, so we can squeeze more energy into the same dimensions.</p>

<p>Did you know 30 million
people play billiards in the United States
alone? I'm <b>Tommy Kennedy</b>, known in poolrooms worldwide as <b>TK</b>, the youngest-ever and sole unranked winner when
crowned the U.S. Open 9-Ball Champion in Chesapeake, Virginia. I beat the #2 player in the world then the #1 player 9-games-to-1 in the final match, in one of the
greatest upsets in billiards history--I
was barely “a kid” then as you can see in the photo below.</p>
<p>I’ve
won nearly 200 professional-level tournaments, been ranked as high as 
4th worldwide, and during my career I’ve defeated 99% of the world's top
 pool pros. I currently live in Florida, six-time Florida
Champion and a record five-time Florida Circuit Player of the Year.</p>
<p>As important, I know tournament play as longtime tournament director and marketer for the <a href=""http://southeastopen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Southeast Open 9-Ball Tour</a>, where peers voted me Sportsman of the
Year. I perform juggling and trick shots for the

Who never broke down his smartphone ? Like you we did! That's why we started considering this issue to find a true and sustainable solution. <br/>Looking around existing protections, we never found one resistant enough, combining design and reliability. The challenge was then: ""are we able to find a smart and long-lasting protection for our smartphone? </p>
<div>
<p>The next question was « How can we keep the original design of our lovely smartphones ? ».<br/>Therefore we focused our research on the thinest, most resistant materials but also able to preserve the look and feel of your smartphone. A true « second skin ».</p>
<p>We are happy to share with you  our new protection : Second Skin by  ThePhoneCoat, designed and mastered to bring back the real look and feel of your smartphone whilst sustainably protecting it for long !</p>

<h1>Development &amp; Prototype</h1>
<p>We took time to study, measure, calculate the dimensions. Because each device is different we had to restart this process for each protection. The hardest part was to find a solution to cover the frame and we’ve done a lot of attempts.
We’ve finally found the right process to create ultimate protections for all devices. </p>

<p>Nous n'avons jamais réussi à trouver une protection résistante alliant esthétique et fiabilité. Pour cette raison, nous avons imaginé et conçu une solution durable pour protéger nos smartphones. Cette seconde peau, modulable devait également s’adapter à votre smartphone. </p>
<p>Nous avons pensé à mille et une façons pour satisfaire ce besoin afin de retrouver le design originel de votre smartphone. Nous avons orienté nos recherches sur des matériaux ultra-fins qui protègent au plus près vos objets connectés.</p>
<p>Nous sommes heureuses de vous faire découvrir aujourd’hui notre nouvelle protection : Second skin by ThePhoneCoat étudiée et modélisée pour rendre le design originel de votre smartphone tout en le protégeant.</p>

What is ThePhoneCoat? 
ThePhoneCoat is made from a high density protection film. Nanotechnology is incorporated inside to increase the quality and the resistance of the raw material to ultimately deliver the best protection. It works like a second skin for your smartphone, your watch, your tablet, computer and even more.
ThePhoneCoat protection is auto-healing. All shocks, abrasions and daily scratches disappear.
Our technology is designed to absorb shocks and prevent damages. It is ultra thin (0.2mm) for a maximal comfort. 
With ThePhoneCoat you will discover again your device in its purest state.























Self regenerated material








Why is ThePhoneCoat so great? 










                           





Featured in : 









        









           
Easy to install





Every inch counts!





Almost invisible...





Improved grip for less drop










 ThePhoneCoat vs the rest










Crash test time!
Auto Healing test We used a metalic brush to visibly scratch our protection. Then we used a hairdryer to accelerate the regenerating processus. (The video wasn’t speed up)





Impact protection A classic screen protection does not resist neither to a fall nor a violent shock (like a hammer shock). ThePhoneCoat protection is shockproof ! it will preserve your phone from being damaged.





A real unbreakable second skinWe used a sander machine to test the abrasion resistance. After few seconds we pilled off the protection and the screen was not damage at all.

Stretch Goals










 The Team




Dorine and Maroussia (from left to right)




Who never broke down his smartphone ? Like you we did! That's why we started considering this issue to find a true and sustainable solution. Looking around existing protections, we never found one resistant enough, combining design and reliability. The challenge was then: ""are we able to find a smart and long-lasting protection for our smartphone? 

The next question was « How can we keep the original design of our lovely smartphones ? ».Therefore we focused our research on the thinest, most resistant materials but also able to preserve the look and feel of your smartphone. A true « second skin ».
We are happy to share with you  our new protection : Second Skin by  ThePhoneCoat, designed and mastered to bring back the real look and feel of your smartphone whilst sustainably protecting it for long !





What does our timeline looks like ?





 
At the end of the campaign, we will send you a survey to finalize your contribution. We aim to finalize all shipping by mid-July 2018.
We don't anticipate any issues with this timeline. However, if anything unexpected happens, we promise to keep you informed, both during and after the campaign. 





Development & Prototype
We took time to study, measure, calculate the dimensions. Because each device is different we had to restart this process for each protection. The hardest part was to find a solution to cover the frame and we’ve done a lot of attempts.
We’ve finally found the right process to create ultimate protections for all devices.

Qu'est-ce que ThePhoneCoat ?
Second Skin by ThePhoneCoat est conçu à partir d’un film de protection ultra résistant. Une nano-technologie est incorporée pour améliorer la qualité et la résistance de notre matière première pour obtenir la meilleure protection. Une réelle seconde peau pour vos smartphones, tablettes, ordinateurs et montres connectées.
Notre protection est auto-régénérante. Les chocs, rayures et frottements fait au quotidien seront absorbés et disparaitront. Notre protection est étudiée pour résister à tout types de chocs et prévenir vos appareils d'une éventuelle casse. Elle est ultra fine (0,2mm) et presque invisible pour un confort maximal.
Avec ThePhoneCoat, redécouvrez le design de votre smartphone à l'état brut.























Nano-technologie auto-cicatrisante

                            






Pourquoi ThePhoneCoat est fait pour vous ? 









                       

   





  




Facile à installer





 Chaque millimètre compte !





 Presque invisible...





 Surface adhérente pour limiter la chute










ThePhoneCoat vs les autres protections 










C'est l'heure du Crash Test !
Résistance aux chocsVous pouvez observez ci-dessous la différence entre une protection classique (type verre trempé) qui ne résiste pas à un choc violent (ex: coup de marteau-comparable à une chute de 1,2 m de haut) et notre produit ThePhoneCoat qui protègera votre smartphone de la plupart des chocs et des chutes du même type.





Auto-régénéranteNous avons utilisé une brosse métallique pour faire de profondes rayures sur la protection ThePhoneCoat. Ensuite, nous avons envoyé de l’air chaud avec un sèche-cheveux pour voir le processus de régénération et cicatrisation à l'oeil nu (la vidéo n’a pas été accélérée).





Une seconde peau incassable Nous avons utilisé une ponceuse pour tester la résistance aux frottements violents. Après quelques secondes, nous avons retiré la protection pour vous montrer que l’écran est resté intact. ThePhoneCoat est une réelle seconde peau protectrice pour votre smartphone !

 Les objectifs ciblés










L'équipe



Dorine et Maroussia (de gauche à droite)




Qui n’a jamais cassé/abimé son smartphone ? Nous les premières ! C’est pourquoi nous avons réfléchi à une vraie solution durable. 


Nous n'avons jamais réussi à trouver une protection résistante alliant esthétique et fiabilité. Pour cette raison, nous avons imaginé et conçu une solution durable pour protéger nos smartphones. Cette seconde peau, modulable devait également s’adapter à votre smartphone. 
Nous avons pensé à mille et une façons pour satisfaire ce besoin afin de retrouver le design originel de votre smartphone. Nous avons orienté nos recherches sur des matériaux ultra-fins qui protègent au plus près vos objets connectés.
Nous sommes heureuses de vous faire découvrir aujourd’hui notre nouvelle protection : Second skin by ThePhoneCoat étudiée et modélisée pour rendre le design originel de votre smartphone tout en le protégeant.





 Quelles sont les prochaines étapes ?






À la fin de la campagne, nous vous enverrons un formulaire pour finaliser votre achat. 
Nous espérons finir les envois pour mi-juillet 2018.
En cas d'éventuels imprévus, nous vous tiendrons informé de l'avancement de notre projet tout au long de la campagne.





 Développement & prototype
Chaque smartphone étant unique et différent, nous avons pris le temps d'adapter notre produit à tout vos appareils. Plusieurs phases de prototypages ont été nécessaires à la découverte de la meilleure couverture possible en terme de dimension et de cadrage.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thank you for taking your time to watch our video. We have been working on this project for the past year and can't be more excited to bring it to Indiegogo and show the world what we envision with our new smart alarm application OnTime. With you support we will be able to move forward from the product design to the software programming and bring to you a great tool for the use of our daily lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $200,000. With this money we can develop the application software for iOS and advertise our new application. Furthermore, we would be able to pay to start building the software for the Android.</p>
<p>Check out our perks! The personalized accessories will give your iPhone or iPad a unique look with the OnTime logo, your name and a message that will read, ""I supported the OnTime campaign,""</p>
<p>If we do not reach our $200,000 goal we will start to build the app for iOS and do our best to advertise the application ourselves. Any money that is contributed to our campaign will be used wisely and only for the use of the development of the software.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The OnTime application was designed for everyone. We all live very busy lives trying to get everything done on time and trying to stretch the minutes to avoid being tardy, but we all know that might not always be possible without help. </p>
<p>The application will help you, by alerting you in advance of any traffic delays that may put you behind schedule or late for work or school. I strongly believe this application will be a great contribution in keeping every one safer while on the highway. How is this possible? By giving you a ""heads up"" of what traffic looks like and giving you notice of  the extra minutes to leave before, you will not have to rush your way your destination.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Power Soccer Hayward</h3>
<p>Imagine a soccer ball flying around an indoor court propelled by athletes using power wheelchairs. Kicking the ball across the court, wheelchairs spinning, the frenzied activity of a great game. </p>
<p>This is what we do at Power Soccer Hayward – a part of the worldwide Power Soccer community. We create opportunities for people with disabilities to become athletes. And like all sports, we do it with the help of our families and communities. </p>
</div>
<div>Power soccer is an exciting sport, similar to indoor soccer. The sport involves strategy, teamwork, and intense competition – not to mention fun.  Each player uses a metal footguard attached to the front of their wheelchair to kick the ball, generally spinning the chair to get good momentum on the ball. There are 3 forwards and 1 goalie on each team, with players passing the ball up the court to each other.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Power soccer has developed in several different countries over the past 30 years, but 2012 marks the first time that Hayward had a team. We now have ten people with disabilities interested in playing power soccer in Hayward, ranging in age from 14 to 60, most being young women aged 18-22.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>YOU make the difference for our athletes. Your support allows us to take someone from non-athlete to world-class athlete or anywhere in between. With the proper resources, each athlete is limited only by their commitment and drive.</p>
<p>We need your help to get our team off the ground.</p>
<p>We need materials and funds to make metal soccer footguards (to kick those balls across the court), gym time (to practice), tires and batteries (we burn through them quickly), uniforms (we need to look like a team), and travel expenses (to improve our skills with games against other teams).</p>
<p>Our goal is $1,000, and we ask you to donate $100 if you can, or $5 if that's what works for you! If we don't reach our goal, we will use whatever we raise to start making guards, and we will continue fundraising.</p>

The Need & What You Get


The Need: WorldSong needs to raise $92,000 to fund this ground breaking app.  This will cover completing the app development, maintenance, upgrades and other related expenses, enabling us to support missionary communications around the globe. 


What you get: In return for your generosity and support, WorldSong is offering some great perks! Everything from small reminders to pray for your missionaries to sponsorship and advertising opportunities for individuals, corporations or in memoriam. 

The Contingency: WorldSong is using the flexible funding campaign through IndieGoGo which means we are able to use any amount that we raise. The priority will be funding the app development followed by other additional expenses as they occur.

<p>We were founded in 2014 by Takahiro Miyasaka, a Japanese entrepreneur and passionate snowboarder. He had the idea for the BONX Grip one day on the slopes in Nagano, and started building our team of veteran hardware and software rockstars.
</p>
<p>After spending a year on development, we completed one of the biggest ever crowdfunding campaigns in Japan raising upwards of $200,000 on GreenFunding.jp—and produced and shipped units to 1,344 backers in early 2016.
</p>
<p>We’ve since made steady progress fine-tuning the product and are now ready to bring the BONX Grip to the rest of the world.

Outdoor athletes. We’ve always had our own style. Our own rules. Our own community and culture. And definitely our own language. But we never had wearable group-talk technology that could keep up with us.

Until now.



The BONX Grip enables group conversations between outdoor athletes. It was built for the places we go. For the performance we need. For the way we talk.

Combining a rugged Bluetooth earpiece and innovative group-talk app, the BONX Grip was custom-designed to out-perform, out-comfort and outlast any VoIP app or standard Bluetooth headset. It goes anywhere your phone has reception, with completely unlimited range. 
That makes it perfect for:





BONX Grip offers the most robust group-talk system designed especially for outdoor sports enthusiasts. All you have to do is speak. Within a fraction of a second, the earpiece picks up your voice with built-in dual microphones, passes it to the smartphone app via Bluetooth, and the app sends the voice data to everybody in your group via cellular network.

Because wherever you go—terrain parks, 14ers, Class IV rapids, open roads—you’ve been there. You’ve had that moment, of total outdoor sports exhilaration, when you wanted to talk to your buddies. But the technology was inadequate. Or your friends were out of range. Or you didn’t want to get your phone (maybe because you were racing down moguls).

That all changes here. With your help, that is.

We did. We love outdoor sports. We love the exhilaration and the freedom. But what we love most is the community—bonding with our friends on the mountain or river or road. We developed the BONX Grip because we wanted a product like it.

We were founded in 2014 by Takahiro Miyasaka, a Japanese entrepreneur and passionate snowboarder. He had the idea for the BONX Grip one day on the slopes in Nagano, and started building our team of veteran hardware and software rockstars.

After spending a year on development, we completed one of the biggest ever crowdfunding campaigns in Japan raising upwards of $200,000 on GreenFunding.jp—and produced and shipped units to 1,344 backers in early 2016.

We’ve since made steady progress fine-tuning the product and are now ready to bring the BONX Grip to the rest of the world. Come join us!






			
				Is the BONX smartphone app required, or can the earpiece be used standalone?
			
		

			
				The free BONX app is required for group conversation, and is available for free on the iOS App Store and Google Play.
			
		



			
				Which smartphones are supported?
			
		

			
				iPhone 5 or newer (> iOS 8) and select Android devices with Android version 4.3 or greater
			
		



			
				How many BONX users can join a conversation simultaneously?
			
		

			
				The BONX app currently supports up to 10 simultaneous group members.
			
		



			
				What is the effective range between BONX users?
			
		

			
				As long as you have cell phone reception, members in your group conversation can be on opposite sides of the world!
			
		



			
				Is cell phone reception required to use BONX Grip?
			
		

			
				Yes, BONX Grip uses your smartphone's data connection to transmit voice data. The earpiece and your phone communicate via Bluetooth and can be up to 10 meters away.
			
		



			
				Can I use BONX Grip as a regular Bluetooth headset or headphones?
			
		

			
				Certainly! You can use BONX Grip for everyday phone calls or to listen to music at home.
			
		



			
				Can I use BONX Grip underwater?
			
		

			
				BONX Grip is rated IPX5 water resistant, which means you can use it above and around water, but not while submerged (i.e. scuba diving, snorkeling).
			
		



			
				Does BONX Grip come with a warranty?
			
		

			
				BONX Grip comes with a 1-year warranty against defects and malfunction. If anything goes wrong, we will replace the unit free of charge with proof of your pledge.
			
		



			
				How can I assign the color of BONX Grip?
			
		

			
				We will send you an e-mail about color preference once the campaign is finished. At this point, there is no function to choose colors at Indiegogo platform.

アウトドアスポーツには、独自のスタイルがある。独自のルールがある。独自のコミュニティと文化がある。そして間違いなく独自の言語がある。ただし、それにピッタリなウェアラブルグループトークテクノロジーはなかった。
今までは。
BONX Gripはアウドドアスポーツをしながら仲間と会話することを可能にする。リアルなフィールドのために、求めるパフォーマンスのために、そして自分たちが気持ちよく話すために、BONX Gripは作られている。


BONX GripはタフなBluetoothイヤフォンと革新的なグループ通話アプリを
組み合わせることで、既存の通話アプリやBluetoothヘッドセットを超えた
快適で安定したパフォーマンスを実現。
携帯電波が入るところならどこでも使えて、相手との距離も無制限だ。 
 こういうアクティビティには最高のアイテムになる。





BONX Gripの頑強なグループトークシステムは様々なシーンで使えますが、アウトドアスポーツには特にピッタリです。とにかく話せばいいだけ。瞬時に本体内臓のデュアルマイクがあなたの声を拾い、Bluetoothでスマホアプリに送信。そしてアプリが3G/4G経由でグループ内の全員にあなたの声を届けます。スノーパーク、険しい山、クラス4の急流、どこまでも続く道…あらゆるフィールドに繰り出し、絶頂の瞬間を味わう。それを仲間と共有したいと思った瞬間があったはず。ただ、テクノロジーが追いついていなかった。もしくは電話を手に取りたくなかった。（コブ斜面で競走してる最中とかね）


それもすべて今日までの話。あなたの支援で変わります。

アウトドアスポーツへの情熱を共有する私たちがBONX Gripを作りました。
その自由と興奮。
そして何より海・山・川で感じる仲間との結びつき。
それこそが私たちが大切にするものです。

<strong>The Differences between the UNO Cable and X-Connect Cable</strong> </h3><p>As you're scrolling down this page, you may be wondering what's so different about this cable? What improvements have we made? We've decided to list them out for you.</p><ul>
<li>The UNO cable has a USB-C connector end which is an upgrade from the current USB Type A. This allows a higher power input and output and enables the UNO to be compatible with QC4.0. </li>
<li>Introduction of an innovative locking mechanism, giving your cable a stronger connection and longer lifespan of up to 40,000 connections.</li>
<li>Reduced the size of the LED hole by 40% from 1mm (0.04"") to 0.6mm (0.02""), which means less ambient light keeping you up at night.</li>
<li>Part of UNO's internal mold is made out of 9T, which is a more temperature resistant material than LCP plastic found on the X-Connect. This means the cable temperature will remain lower whilst charging.</li>
<li>The UNO wire thickness has been increased by 20% to handle more charge, bringing QC2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 compatibility. </li>
<li>The UNO cable introduces an improved anti-fray neck, meaning your cables will have increased durability and less chance of cables fraying or snapping at the most common weak point.</li>
<li>We've increased the warranty period from the industry standard 1 year to our premium 10 year warranty.</li>
<li>Each UNO cable set comes with a 1.5m (4.9ft) cable. A 2.5m (8.2ft) cable is also available for purchase separately.</li>
<li>Each UNO set comes with a bonus tip removal tool allowing you to remove the tip from all your devices with ease.</li>
</ul><p>For those who are already proud owners of the asap X-Connect cable, the beauty of the UNO cable is that it will be 100% backwards compatible with the tips and cables you already own. This allows you to easily incorporate the UNO cable into your arsenal. </p><div data-id=""24711197""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1558029885/lffnlgemhpr7n0x7zlip.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Each UNO cable set features 2x N52 grade neodymium magnets which are the world's strongest commercial grade magnets.  When we say we're using the world's strongest magnets, we mean it! How strong you might ask? Strong enough to hold an iPad Air which is 437g (0.96lb)!  </p><div data-id=""24655329""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/dGHkgiz.gif"" src=""""/></p>

FLASH: World's Most Powerful 150W USB-C Powerbank

 

Meet the UNO Cable, Chargeasap's latest innovation in magnetic cables. Unparalleled quality, convenience and aesthetics brought to you by a company who believe that users should be the creators and innovators of products.    We rely on our phones for just about every part of our day. The way you interact with your phone is crucial to your daily productivity and happiness and we intend to improve that interaction with UNO: the world's first cross-compatible USB-C magnetic USB cable. 

The Differences between the UNO Cable and X-Connect Cable As you're scrolling down this page, you may be wondering what's so different about this cable? What improvements have we made? We've decided to list them out for you.
The UNO cable has a USB-C connector end which is an upgrade from the current USB Type A. This allows a higher power input and output and enables the UNO to be compatible with QC4.0. 
Introduction of an innovative locking mechanism, giving your cable a stronger connection and longer lifespan of up to 40,000 connections.
Reduced the size of the LED hole by 40% from 1mm (0.04"") to 0.6mm (0.02""), which means less ambient light keeping you up at night.
Part of UNO's internal mold is made out of 9T, which is a more temperature resistant material than LCP plastic found on the X-Connect. This means the cable temperature will remain lower whilst charging.
The UNO wire thickness has been increased by 20% to handle more charge, bringing QC2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 compatibility. 
The UNO cable introduces an improved anti-fray neck, meaning your cables will have increased durability and less chance of cables fraying or snapping at the most common weak point.
We've increased the warranty period from the industry standard 1 year to our premium 10 year warranty.
Each UNO cable set comes with a 1.5m (4.9ft) cable. A 2.5m (8.2ft) cable is also available for purchase separately.
Each UNO set comes with a bonus tip removal tool allowing you to remove the tip from all your devices with ease.
For those who are already proud owners of the asap X-Connect cable, the beauty of the UNO cable is that it will be 100% backwards compatible with the tips and cables you already own. This allows you to easily incorporate the UNO cable into your arsenal. Each UNO cable set features 2x N52 grade neodymium magnets which are the world's strongest commercial grade magnets.  When we say we're using the world's strongest magnets, we mean it! How strong you might ask? Strong enough to hold an iPad Air which is 437g (0.96lb)!  
 We have upgraded the magnetic strength of the UNO cable through incorporating an innovative locking mechanism, giving your cable a stronger connection and longer lifespan. This stronger magnetic strength means it can support a heavier cable, which is why we've increased the length of all the cables on offer. Each cable set now comes with a 1.5m (4.9ft) cable with a 2.5m (8.2ft) cable also available for purchase separately. We've also improved the connectivity lifespan of the older cables from 30,000 to 40,000 connections. Means a longer lasting cable that will outlast you!When we mean 1 cable for all your phones, tablets and USB devices, we mean it. We've designed 3 connectors (Lightning, Micro USB & Type C) to fit all your modern devices from headphones, to speakers, Nintendo switch, E-cigs, the list goes on. The UNO cable is capable of 2-way full speed USB 2.0 data transfer at 480 Mbps between any USB devices. Our cables feature a reversible magnetic connection which means instant connection every single time. No more fumbling around to connect your devices, even in the dark. Better yet, connecting to your phone during difficult situations without pausing what you're doing has never been easier, even when you only have 1 hand free, such as driving on-the-go. An often overlooked feature of magnetic cables is that it will protect your phone port from dust and dirt entering. By leaving the tip in there, it will also extend the life of your phone port from the normal wear and tear of cables being inserted and pulled out on a daily basis.Each cable set comes with a 1.5m (4.9ft) cable.  You can purchase additional cables that are a longer 2.5m (8.2ft) for $15 on the Backerkit survey.  Our mold has already been completed so we're ready to ship in July 2019. We're currently running a beta testing program which will be open to backers of this campaign also. Details will be sent once the campaign has launched.  We'll take into consideration all this precious feedback to make any final revisions to the design to make the perfect USB cable for all your needs. Initial feedback from early testers has been very positive, though we're always open to suggestions on how to better design our cables for you.The Alpha tip (for Apple devices) design has also been upgraded. With the first version we tested an incompatibility rate of 1 in 100. We've now reduced that to 4 in 1000 which is a far lower default rate than consumer electronics industry standards.We understand that some of your devices still use a Type A port so to ensure we don't exclude any of them. We're offering Type A USB adapters as an optional add-on for only $9. This adapter is compatible with our UNO cable as well as all USB-C cables.What sets our magnetic cables apart from others is our unique beveled and concave magnetic connector design on both the tip end and cable head end which has been adopted since the original asap Connect cable.Competitor designs require the tips to be correctly aligned inside the cable head which requires guidance to be connected correctly if missed. Competitor designs also use weaker magnets and require a very perfect alignment of the cable and tip for a correct connection. See if you can guess which is our cable below.Don't be fooled by the similar external look of competitor cables, our magnetic cables will connect correctly even if the tip is flipped 180°, due to both the strong neodymium magnets having their polarity perfectly positioned and the unique outward and concave magnetic connector design.  We've listened to customer feedback and reduced the size of the LED hole by 40% from 1mm (0.04"") to 0.6mm (0.02""), which means less ambient light keeping you up at night. The new UNO cable LED light is always on, as long as your cable is plugged into the power source so its easier to find, especially at night. This means you no longer need to plug in both ends for the LED to turn on.
A common suggestion from customers has been reducing the temperature of the cable, we've been able to achieve this initially through a more efficient processing chip.One of the biggest challenges we've overcome is reducing the temperature of the cables whilst ensuring maximum charge speed in our compact cable design.  We've been able to take the temperature reduction a step further with a revised mold design made of of 9T which is a more temperature resistant material instead of LCP plastic found on the X-Connect. The end result is a cooler to touch cable, particularly during use with QC3.0/4.0.The UNO cable is made from quality material including military grade tangle free nylon. Thicker cables allow for extra currents, which means a faster charge. That's why we've increased the diameter of the cable by 20% to ensure QC2, 3 and 4.0 compatibility.Above is a bend test machine. We put our cables through a bend test, at least 10,000 times of 180 degrees to ensure it can last through all your rigorous daily usage. With each version of our magnetic cables we carefully listen to user feedback and back improvements where we can. The UNO cable will be the first to introduce an improved anti-fray neck, meaning your cables will have increased durability and less chance of cables fraying or snapping at the most common weak point. Above you can see a direct comparison of how thicker the UNO cable (on the right) is compared to our X-Connect range. The X-Connect range is also made of premium materials of course and doesn't have any issues. This anti-fray neck significantly increases the lifespan of the cable handling everyday wear and tear well, hence we're backing it up with our first product with a 10 year warranty.Each cable comes with a complimentary cord wrap, great for shortening the length of the cable or quickly wrapping the cable away for neat and tidy storage or transportation.Each cable set now comes with a bonus tip removal tool to allow you to remove the tip from all your devices with ease. Please note that this tool isn't required, though some people prefer using it for phones with cases or devices with depressed USB holes such as a GoPro.Through years of design and material testing, we've reduced the size of our magnetic cable tips to only 10mm (0.39"") wide which fits perfectly into all your Apple and Android devices. We've tested the tips on over 100 phone cases and found it fit on all of them. The only exception is for some phone cases which have a protective flap on the charging port which may not be able to close properly with the tip in place. In saying that, we have tested with the popular LifeProof for iPhone X and Samsung S9 which fits fine. Do note that if you're using any old school phones such as the Samsung S5 phone with an inbuilt protective flap, you won't be able to close the flap with the tip inserted.  With the improved materials and machinery process we're using to build each UNO cable, we can now increase the warranty period from the standard 1 year you find from most cable brands to our premium 10 year warranty. Finally a cable that is designed to outlast your next decade worth of phones!  You can add additional cable sets, cables, tips and adapters to your order by adding in the extra value of the items. Don't fret if you make a mistake or want to add more to your order later as you will be emailed a survey from BackerKit 14 days after your purchase, asking you to choose your options and another chance to purchase additional add-ons including tips, adapters, cables, sets and update your shipping address. Any new purchases from the BackerKit survey will not have an extra shipping charge and you will be offered the discounted rate per add on if you purchased a special or volume perk (for example if you purchased a reward where cables sets were $16, then all additional cable sets are $16). You will have 14 business days to complete your survey from the day you receive it. If you have any questions after the survey has arrived please email hello@chargeasap.com and the Customer Happiness Team will respond within 48 business hours. 
All previous Chargeasap products have been granted the following international certifications to meet quality manufacturing standards and sound environmental practices. UNO Cable will also be applying to receive these certifications before shipping. Beware of imitations, fake and low quality magnetic cables on the Internet. We have purchased samples directly off dozens of suppliers who claim to produce premium magnetic USB cables and performed both extensive laboratory and daily-use testing.Here are our findings:
We have found many to not work as claimed, not be reversible, not transfer data nor charge your phone as it's maximum speed. We have even found some to create smoke and even damage your phone
Many of these companies offer cables that do not have the following international certifications: FCC, CE, ROHS and hence may not be approved for sale in your country. You should always ask the seller first if they have these international certifications before making a purchase
We have found many companies to use poor quality magnets that have weak magnetism or lose their connectivity over time due to no magnetic plating
We have found many companies produce tip designs that are too bulky to fit most phone cases

<p></p></div>","My-Stand ""World Cup 2014 Edition""My-Stand
is simple, necessary and stylish. It is a
stable Mobile Phone stand composed of two acrylic pieces digitally printed.But not
just that.INSPIRATION
Tired of
dropping our phone, not being able to show any videos when hanging
with our friends, or listen to music when we are stressed at work! We simply came up
with the idea one shiny day at the office, where, brainstorming for a
design competition, Christine, in an effort to show us a paradigm of
synthesis,dropped her mobile phone and spilled coffee on it,
resulting on a damaged device and an absolutely mad woman!
Then and
there, we thought, what   IF?    What if we had a stand that can be
used as a tool to use our phones in multiple ways without the risk of
dropping it or damaging it in any way!We are sure lots of you out there think the same!That's why me Manolis, Dimitra, Stamatis and Christine spent a lot of time and effort to make ""My-Stand"" World Cup 2014 edition a realised creation!WHAT WE ARE UP TO




The
football World Cup  2014 is approaching quickly, and as we have many
many fans here in Greece we said, why not? 

WHY NOT
create a reminder of this memory, a lucky charm to keep with, a
commemorative plaque to carry in the football field! A colourful
proof of support to your favourite team!Composed of two acrylic pieces, it is easy to make your own Mobile Phone stand. Your favorite country's flag is digitally printed on the acrylic back of this stand, as an impressive artwork made with love from our design team. In addition, ""good luck!"" is signed in each language, respecting the individual culture that participates in the Games! 




What We Need (and What You'll Get!)

Our first goal is $1000, which will cover the costs of getting this project to realisation. In addition, the money will cover the cost and shipping of your rewards, paying Indiegogo and PayPal fees. The more money we raise, the more viable our World Cup 2014 campaign is, so don't stop donating if you see we've exceeded our goal.  Any additional funds will go towards promotional costs and the extension of our palette of flags.On the
surface of a transparent acrylic plaque, we have carefully designed and digitally printed an artwork of each of the 32 flags of the countries that participate
in the World Cup 2014 football competition. Furthemore, a ""good luck!"" in each country language is printed as well as the years each team has won the Cup! (ex. Brazil, Boa sorte!, 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, 2002) The
procedure is simple:
1. Select
 the artwork that represents the team you are supporting and send us by note or email your selection:
2. Receive
it to your door, in an Origami Design Envelope Packaging that has the following dimensions: WRAPPED: 14,2cm x 12cm (5,60'' x 4,72'')
3. Assemble
the two acrylic pieces so easily to make your own Mobile Phone stand or de-assemble
them, hang  the My-Stand “World Cup 2014” edition to your neck from
the special made hole on its upper part, go to the football field
(your couch or even your local cafeteria) and cheer your team,
stating your support!

You can
also use it (either the bigger,or the smaller piece) as a holder to your key-chain, holding your keys in an
elegant way.
Only 100
pieces for each flag are collectable, made in an exclusive edition, where
they will all  be digitally numbered and be accompanied by a certificate.BUY
yours now! Be one of the first to keep forever the memory of World
Cup 2014 in proof.

Rainbow Drop in a variety of ways, but we know that our first challenge is to
spread the word out. We hope we can drive enough traffic to make Rainbow Drop a
huge success through the use of social media, blogs and your sharing! 
      We've been working with our own
manufacture partners since we start ""LaunchiN60days"" project and we
have already built several test prototypes. Mitigating the risk of delays in
production and delivery is our major task now. We anticipate to send out the
Rainbow Drop before Dec 24th 2013 as X'mas Gift to you. 
If you like our idea of ""Rainbow Drop"",
want to support “LaunchiN60days” project or
believe in Allen and MakeSimply Team,
please don’t hesitate to order Rainbow Drop now.
Your support will place a huge impact to the
community
and help us to make it better!
Last but not least,
we want to thank you again for your invaluable support and taking the time
visiting this campaign page.
