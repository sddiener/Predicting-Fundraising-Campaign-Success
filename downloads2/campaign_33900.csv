<p>As passionate as we are about eliminating debt for those struggling now with repayment, we have been advised by members of Strike Debt that because of the tax implications, we would be causing those that we wish to help more harm than good. However the solution to a debt free future for those in college now and in the future still exists. The crowdfunding model works the same; it’s just the method of eliminating the debt we have to change in order to comply with tax codes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cash gifts paid directly to educational institutions are not considered taxable gifts, therefore providing an alternative source of funding for students, instead of relying on loans to fund the remainder of the tuition that scholarships and grants couldn’t cover.</p>
<p>The average debt that two thirds of graduating college students accrues now stands at around $27,000. That’s roughly an average of $6,750 every year that students need in loans to accommodate the costs of tuition. We are aware not everyone is directly affected by loans but <strong><em>all</em></strong> college students share a common bond of personal growth and desire. It is that common bond that we are hoping creates solidarity among every college student in America to give $3 to ensure that <strong><em>anyone</em></strong> who desires to pursue their dreams of growth can do so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal is to create a loan resistance of grand proportion by creating solidarity for college students living a debt free existence after their education. The following perks benefit the following number of students:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>$3 joins you and 9999 others in solidarity to remove loans from 4 college students' yearly financial aid package. Debt Free Future</li>
<li>$6 joins you and 9999 others in solidarity to remove loans from 8 college students' yearly financial aid package. Debt Free Future</li>
<li>$9 joins you and 9999 others in solidarity to remove loans from 13 college students' yearly financial aid package. Debt Free Future</li>
<li>$12 joins you and 9999 others in solidarity to remove loans from 17 college students' yearly financial aid package. Debt Free Future</li>
<li>$15 joins you and 9999 others in solidarity to remove loans from 22 college students' yearly financial aid package. Debt Free Future</li>
<li>$25 is your gift to helping us fund the cost of creating our organization’s structure.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Although we are creating our community base and brand awareness here, our goal is to create a nationwide community for commonality among college students and others to the idea of “equity financing” and resistance to loans rather than the traditional debt financing we have dealt with for the past 50 years. With our organization and committed individuals ready to give we could have the new solution to eliminating student debt in colleges across the country for this generation of college students and beyond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just to put in perspective if every college student in America gave up $3 a week for a year, the 20 million college students who are enrolled at the colleges and universities all over this country together could help eliminate the need for loans for hundreds of thousands of their fellow students every fall.</p>
<p>The big picture will be a generation of educated individuals free from the burden of debt to make career decisions based on passion rather than need. Not to mention the extra money, not used for student debt, can go back into the economy rather than the lenders which could certainly use a boost. What affect will this plan have on college tuition, the student loan lenders, tax payer dollars, economic ramifications are far from being known, however we believe it is a relatively cheap investment for an experiment with a potentially grand outcome.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">My name is Natalie Pena, and I am currently a graduating senior at the University of New Mexico's Anderson School of Management. Throughout my journey, I have been guided by various mentors and advisors. They have all had a vested interest in my accomplishments and achievements and have continually supported my efforts to become the best possible leader for my community. With that said, I was invited to attend a leadership training that changed my life and will change our community.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">With that said, a group of women are in the process of developing a training for young high school girls to engage in the training as well. However, we cannot support these young ladies until we attend all of the leadership trainings and become a coach. Being a coach will allow us to train women and young women into leadership roles. This is a wonderful opportunity for the community, university, and high school students. </span></span></span><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">If you support our vision, you will directly transform our community. </span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">In order to take the training to become a coach and start transforming our community, we are commited to raise the money. The cost of the three month training is 1,200 per person. Our goal is to sponsor four women. Throughout the training, we will build relationships with people who can support our effort of training high school girls. </span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">Furthermore, throughout the training will dive deeper into becoming a leadership coach. This will allow us to support the young girls who attend the training. In turn, you will get a deeper insight to the possibilities of transformational leadership and a person who is dedicated to transforming the community. </span></span></span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;"">Transformational leadership uses positivism to transform teams, groups, and communities.

</div></div>","Summary
My name is Natalie Pena, and I am currently a graduating senior at the University of New Mexico's Anderson School of Management. Throughout my journey, I have been guided by various mentors and advisors. They have all had a vested interest in my accomplishments and achievements and have continually supported my efforts to become the best possible leader for my community. With that said, I was invited to attend a leadership training that changed my life and will change our community.
With that said, a group of women are in the process of developing a training for young high school girls to engage in the training as well. However, we cannot support these young ladies until we attend all of the leadership trainings and become a coach. Being a coach will allow us to train women and young women into leadership roles. This is a wonderful opportunity for the community, university, and high school students. If you support our vision, you will directly transform our community. 


What We Need & What You Get
In order to take the training to become a coach and start transforming our community, we are commited to raise the money. The cost of the three month training is 1,200 per person. Our goal is to sponsor four women. Throughout the training, we will build relationships with people who can support our effort of training high school girls. 
 
Furthermore, throughout the training will dive deeper into becoming a leadership coach. This will allow us to support the young girls who attend the training. In turn, you will get a deeper insight to the possibilities of transformational leadership and a person who is dedicated to transforming the community. 
 
 


The Impact
Transformational leadership uses positivism to transform teams, groups, and communities. Through the use of inspiration, transformational leaders can support team members by focusing on continued motivation. Furthermore, transformational leadership coaches encourage and support a persons desire to be the best possible leader they can be. It is through a coaches commitment that transformational leadership is sustainable and possible.

<ul>
<li><em><em><strong>Background:</strong></em></em></li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Anastasia Somoza and I am 29 years old and my home town is New York City.  Since graduating from Georgetown University with a BA in Government, I have been unable to find a job outside of unpaid internships.  An extraordinary opportunity is paving the way for me to enjoy a productive and exciting career. In 2011, I received a full scholarship to read for my Master's degree in Human Rights at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) a two year program.  </p>
<p>Here's a little background. Throughout my life, my mother has had to fight to get an education for me and for my twin sister Alba, who is also significantly disabled with cerebral palsy. The greatest battle was with the public schools, where we fought to attend regular classes rather than be relegated to special education classes, which at that time amounted to little more than warehousing for students with special needs.    </p>
<p>In New York City, Medicaid pays for my aide full time, even if I sit home watching television all day. Through a Medicaid waiver, I was able to provide funding for an aide to help me during my time at Georgetown University. However, the story changes when financing is needed to support an aide during study overseas. Medicaid will no longer fund any student's aide outside of New York.</p>
<p>Since last year, my mother and I have worked on legislation that would allow students accepted by an institution of higher learning to take their aide with them while in school. Following my acceptance by LSE, we worked closely with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on securing a waiver that would enable my aide to accompany me to London. But just two days before our flight to Heathrow, we received a call denying us that waiver.  </p>
<h3><strong>Refusing to Give Up on My Dream </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em><em><strong>Off to London I Went: </strong></em></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Already having purchased tickets my mom, sister and I arrived at LSE anyway. We tried and failed to secure funding, but at the 11th hour a friend offered to fund an aide for two months while we tried to fundraise.   An aide came to help me, but it did not work out and she returned abruptly to the U.S.   I had no choice but to come back, seek a deferment of my scholarship, and continue with the fundraising in the hopes of returning in September 2012.</p>
<p>I was devastated to have to leave LSE. Equally significant to the obstacle I faced in being able to overcome the personal care challenges that had occurred, was the inaccessibility of the LSE residence. It was impossible for me to get to my room independently. I had to go through three large fire doors that I could not open on my own. The door to my room was also not automatic and these were just two of many accessibility related details overlooked when I was advised to live in this particular LSE residential hall. Sadly, the room was as far from appropriate or wheelchair-user friendly as it could have been.</p>
<p>The silver lining in the cloud was the involvement of an Emeritus member of the Board of Governors helping me reach an agreement with the school administration to effect some important changes. The meeting was great!  The LSE agreed to make significant accessibility changes to their residences, fund a room for my aides, and work with SCOPE (England's equivalent to United Cerebral Palsy) to make the LSE fully accessible to the extent possible for all students with disabilities.</p>
<p>...And so back home New York City, the fundraiser for the 1st year of care was launched!</p>
<h3><strong>LSE, HUMAN RIGHTS and Me are Meant to BE</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Result: </strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I am incredibly happy to report that through the tireless efforts of friends and family, we raised enough money for me to return to London for this initial year and have 3 community service volunteers funded to assist me with daily living needs!  Not only that, but on arrival, the London School of Economics had completely overhauled the rooms on the ground floor of our residence at Grosvenor House to provide totally accessible rooms for students with disabilities!   I am so thankful to all the people who made this happen.   The rooms are now world class, and compliant with codes.<strong> Bottom line, my second time has been a charm:</strong> LSE has been great, and absolutely willing to improve things for students with disabilities in any way they can!!</p>
<p>Living abroad, attending a world renowned institution, while adjusting to a new academic system and everything else that comes along with a life changing opportunity such as this, has been both a dream and a privilege! I'm always reminded that life isn't easy and that no goal is worth aspiring to and achieving without sometimes struggling and fighting for it. This journey at LSE is no different. I have faced familiar and unanticipated challenges but with endless hours of hard work, giving everything my best effort and an  enormous amount of support from many,  I have learned a great deal, made the most of this amazing opportunity and successfully completed my first year!</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need </strong></h2>
<p>This campaign page is the <strong>s</strong><strong>econd</strong><strong> round</strong> of the fundraising effort for the <strong>s</strong><strong>econd year </strong>of <strong>care!!</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>So <strong>ALL funds raised on this page (and 1 or 2 more campaigns to follow)</strong> will cover the  cost of funding <strong>3 Community Service Volunteers (CSVs)</strong> to assist me.  The approximate cost  is $15,000 for the upcoming year, per volunteer <strong>(including care coverage for 2 or 3 more months than I required the first year, as I will need to be at LSE through the end of NEXT SUMMER, 2014, to complete my dissertation).</strong>   British law only allows the volunteers to work a certain number of hours. As such, I will need<strong> roughly $50,000 to return next year, finish my degree </strong>and it will be because of the generosity of family, friends potential sponsors and other supporters, that I will become a MASTER in Human Rights!!</p>
<h2><strong><span>What You Get</span></strong></h2>
<p>I pledge to continue being a dedicated and hardworking student, and, as a graduate, to go out into the world at large and help improve conditions for others like myself.</p>
<p>I will post updates on the site on a regular basis to let you all know how it is going over here, and hopefully I can effect more changes for students with disabilities along the way.  Please understand that this is a situation where every little bit really will help! I shall be sincerely grateful for any financial assistance from friends, family, and members of the public. <strong>I promise to show my immense appreciation and gratitude to every single donor/supporter/word-spreading/sponsor-getting ambassador with boatloads of hugs,  phone calls and/or a personalized ""THANK YOU"" email depending on how near or far you are!!!!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It's my firm belief that the impact of our campaign will lead to an awareness of the obstacles that people with disabilities face when trying to access higher education. If any non-disabled student received the type of wonderful scholarship opportunity that I have, he/she would not have to decline the offer because of the need for a personal-care aide. My mother and I continue our work together on legislation that will enable students with any disability that necessitates personal-care assistance to take their aide with them if they are enrolled at an institution of higher education. Long-term, this legislation will help people with disabilities to reach their maximum potential and have a better shot at becoming employed. It will also get them off social services and help them to become independent and enjoy a better quality of life.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>Donations from friends, family, associates and the public at large will, of course, be the greatest help. Additionally, I ask each of you to become an ambassador for my campaign. Please spread the word among your own circle of friends and contacts through Facebook and other social-media channels. This will rapidly build awareness, and will truly help me reach my fundraising goal. And of course, outreach to local media contacts you may have can also help tremendously in getting the message out.  We are also looking into the possibility of a corporate sponsor funding one community service volunteer.  So, if you have any contacts or know of corporations that provide grants to people with disabilities, please let me and my family know</p>
<p><strong>***REMEMBER EVERY LITTLE BIT COUNTS***</strong> I am hoping that you will all help me get the word out in any way you can. Thank you for believing in me, for all your effort and support in encouraging me to continue overcoming adversity in pursuit of my goals and dreams, and most importantly for never allowing me to give up no matter what the odds!!</p>

The
art of practising is a special area of interest to me and is rarely
taught specifically enough. Our practice
time at the piano is just as significant to the end product as the hours of
training undertaken by professional athletes, but this time can so easily be
wasted unless we have the know-how.  Effective
practice is essential to mastering the piano and it’s for this reason that I
have spent decades researching and experimenting in the art of practising to
find the optimal approaches.</p><p>I’ve
developed a methodology comprising practice tools, strategies and techniques
which have been tried and tested by students of all ages and levels of ability.  I would love to see as many people as possible
benefit from my work.  Therefore I have embarked upon a number of initiatives
in order to make my work more widely accessible for those who cannot get to me
for one-to-one lessons:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>My blog (<a href=""http://www.practisingthepiano.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.practisingthepiano.com</a>) which is regularly updated and contains hundreds of articles on subjects
relating to piano playing</li>
<li>A <a href=""http://www.practisingthepiano.com/ebooks/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Multimedia eBook series</a> which combines text, video, audio and numerous musical examples to introduce my methodology and approach</li>
<li>A<b> print version</b> of my eBook series which is currently being developed due
to popular demand</li>
</ul><p>My
blog and eBooks provide a conceptual introduction to my approach and I am now
seeking your support to build on these foundations and take my work to the next

We'd like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported the crowdfunding campaign prior to launch. The Online Academy wouldn’t have been possible without your support and we very much appreciate your vote of confidence in the project!Although it has been an interesting journey over the last few months, the launch of the Online Academy is only the beginning. With the site now up and running, we will be extending, updating and refining its content on a continuous basis (please click here to find out more about the content what we’re currently working on). We’ll also be giving our subscribers regular opportunities to provide feedback and input so that we can shape the content according to your needs.Please click here to find out more or click here to visit the site, view free content and subscribe.
The story so far... 
Hello, I'm Graham Fitch and I'm  passionate about teaching and playing the piano. The
art of practising is a special area of interest to me and is rarely
taught specifically enough. Our practice
time at the piano is just as significant to the end product as the hours of
training undertaken by professional athletes, but this time can so easily be
wasted unless we have the know-how.  Effective
practice is essential to mastering the piano and it’s for this reason that I
have spent decades researching and experimenting in the art of practising to
find the optimal approaches.I’ve
developed a methodology comprising practice tools, strategies and techniques
which have been tried and tested by students of all ages and levels of ability.  I would love to see as many people as possible
benefit from my work.  Therefore I have embarked upon a number of initiatives
in order to make my work more widely accessible for those who cannot get to me
for one-to-one lessons:
My blog (www.practisingthepiano.com) which is regularly updated and contains hundreds of articles on subjects
relating to piano playing
A Multimedia eBook series which combines text, video, audio and numerous musical examples to introduce my methodology and approach
A print version of my eBook series which is currently being developed due
to popular demand
My
blog and eBooks provide a conceptual introduction to my approach and I am now
seeking your support to build on these foundations and take my work to the next
level with my new initiative, the Practising the Piano Online Academy.What is it?


The Practising the Piano Online Academy  is an extensive, searchable, and regularly updated library of lessons, articles and resources which will:
Illustrate my methodologies and approach in more depth with multimedia content, interactive features and resources such as musical examples, worksheets and annotated scores which can be downloaded and printed.
Expand on practice tools and strategies with masterclasses and tutorials applying them to popular pieces in the repertoire, exam syllabuses and specific technical challenges.

Share the expertise of guest
experts on subjects including applied theory, improvisation and healthy piano playing.

Be regularly updated, easily
searchable and allow for personalisation with bookmarking and notes.
Be shaped by your input, responding
to your questions and suggestions for new content to meet your needs.
Features & examplesThe Practising the Piano Online Academy will feature numerous lessons, articles, masterclasses and tutorials which can be navigated and searched by topics, sub topics, tags and key words:

Subscribers will be able to submit and vote for topics and content to be featured:

There will also be resources which can be downloaded and printed for use at the keyboard or in lessons:

Please visit the ""gallery"" tab above for additional images and screenshots.  A demo site featuring sample content is also available here.

What it will do for you?
Whether
you are a budding student, keen amateur, passionate piano teacher or a
professional musician, the Practising the Piano Online Academy will provide you with the
knowledge and resources at your finger-tips to:
Get the best possible results from your time spent practising the piano.
Avoid injury and overcome technical
     difficulties with panache.
Learn new pieces quickly and master
     trouble spots or challenging areas within the repertoire.
Deliver performances or achieve examination results which reflect your full potential.


Inspire your students and enhance their enjoyment of the piano.

<p><i>“<span>Hace tres años mi nivel de inglés era muy bajo y decidí apuntarme a clases de inglés. Me costaba mucho memorizar el vocabulario, sobre todo ¡los dichosos verbos irregulares!

Y si esto me facilitaba a mí el estudio de la gramática inglesa… ¿por qué no acercarlo a más personas? Así nació the iRegular project.</span></i></p>

<h3>Testimonios</h3>
<p><i>""Doy clases Inglés a chavales de bachillerato usando diferentes metodologías. Les dije que aprenderíamos los verbos de una forma diferente. 117 niños de entre 11 y 17 años dibujaron sus verbos favoritos. En el examen sobre verbos irregulares, te puedo decir que hubo más de un 95% de aprobados. 
Quiero que sepais que es mi intención difundir esta idea en todos los centros educativos que pueda y esto lo hago cómo agradecimiento por la inspiración que nos habeis dado con vuestro proyecto.""

<p><i>“Three years ago, my English level was quite low so I decided to sign up for English classes. I realized that one of the most difficult things for me was to memorize the vocabulary, especially all the irregular verbs. Almost intuitively, and because of my designer background, I started to draw those verbs using various elements. I then discovered that, thanks to this visual component, I remembered them much better. That helped me to better study English grammar. Why wouldn’t I want to share this with other people? That’s how the iRegular Project was born.</i></p>
<p><i><a href=""https://vimeo.com/41257199"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I filmed a video to share the idea</a>.  In the video, I asked designers and programmers to take part in the project and develop a visual and interactive application that would make studying the English irregular verbs easier"".</i></p>

La historia
Si quieres conocer la historia completa: TEDx sobre the iRegular project



“Hace tres años mi nivel de inglés era muy bajo y decidí apuntarme a clases de inglés. Me costaba mucho memorizar el vocabulario, sobre todo ¡los dichosos verbos irregulares! Como soy diseñadora empecé a diseñar y dibujar los verbos irregulares. Así descubrí que gracias a este componente visual ¡los recordaba! Y si esto me facilitaba a mí el estudio de la gramática inglesa… ¿por qué no acercarlo a más personas? Así nació the iRegular project.




Grabé un vídeo compartiendo la idea. Allí, pedía a diseñadores y programadores que se unieran al proyecto con el fin de desarrollar una aplicación visual e interactiva que facilitara el estudio de los verbos irregulares en inglés. 
A los pocos días de colgar el vídeo, ya contaba con más 100 peticiones de artistas de todo el mundo que querían unirse al movimiento iRegular de forma altruista. Fue increíble y eso me hizo pensar que las ideas que nacen del corazón atraen a muchas  buenas personas.""

Inés Arroyo, founder at todaunadama creative studio
---
Gracias a la profesionalidad y colaboración de estos artistas, pudimos lanzar en el 2012 la primera versión de the iRegular project con 54 verbos, disponible en formato iPad. A los pocos meses, la aplicación se convirtió en nº1 de la categoría educativa de la AppStore.



Todo este trabajo  se ha desarrollado gracias a la colaboración altruista de más de 100 profesionales durante dos años y medio. Ahora tenemos más de 130 verbos irregulares diseñados que esperan ser implementados ¡por eso necesitamos tu ayuda!

¡Colabora para que podamos desarrollar una aplicación completa para Android e iOS!
¿Qué queremos? 
Hacer the iRegular project accesible para el mayor número de gente posible. Queremos crear una aplicación disponible para iOS y Android con los 154 verbos irregulares en inglés con traducción de la aplicación a los ocho idiomas más hablados en el mundo. 
¿Cómo se va a distribuir este dinero?
Esta cantidad nos daría para desarrollar la base de la app y un numero limitado de verbos y funcionalidades, pero nos gustaría poder llegar a mas :)




¿Y si conseguimos menos dinero del objetivo marcado?
Si conseguimos menos importe, haremos todo lo posible para poner la infraestructura de la app y desarrollaremos el número de verbos que el importe recaudado nos permita llegar.
¿Por qué participar en nuestra campaña?

Gracias a la tecnología y a las nuevas herramientas digitales, la forma de educar y de aprender ha cambiado. La interactividad y la colaboración en red son fundamentales. Desde the iRegular project fomentamos estos valores. Queremos seguir desarrollando nuevas técnicas de aprendizaje vinculadas al diseño, tecnología y educación. ¡COLABORA!

Testimonios
""Doy clases Inglés a chavales de bachillerato usando diferentes metodologías. Les dije que aprenderíamos los verbos de una forma diferente. 117 niños de entre 11 y 17 años dibujaron sus verbos favoritos. En el examen sobre verbos irregulares, te puedo decir que hubo más de un 95% de aprobados. 
Quiero que sepais que es mi intención difundir esta idea en todos los centros educativos que pueda y esto lo hago cómo agradecimiento por la inspiración que nos habeis dado con vuestro proyecto.""

The Story
Would you like to know the complete story? TEDx about the iRegular project

“Three years ago, my English level was quite low so I decided to sign up for English classes. I realized that one of the most difficult things for me was to memorize the vocabulary, especially all the irregular verbs. Almost intuitively, and because of my designer background, I started to draw those verbs using various elements. I then discovered that, thanks to this visual component, I remembered them much better. That helped me to better study English grammar. Why wouldn’t I want to share this with other people? That’s how the iRegular Project was born.
I filmed a video to share the idea.  In the video, I asked designers and programmers to take part in the project and develop a visual and interactive application that would make studying the English irregular verbs easier"".
Inés Arroyo, founder at todaunadama creative studio

Just a few days after uploading the video, more than 100 artists from around the world had already responded and wanted to join the iRegular movement altruistically. It was so exciting!
Thanks to the professionalism and collaboration of these artists, we were able to launch the first version of the iRegular Project in 2012 with 54 verbs for the iPad. A few months later, our application became Nº1 App in the AppStore’s education category.
We want to keep growing! That’s why we’ve launched this Crowdfunding campaign. Our goal is for the iRegular Project App, which already has 120 designed and animated verbs, to be available for iPad and Android mobile devices.
Do you want to take part in this movement that joins design, technology and education? Contribute to the iRegular Project!

What happens if we receive less than our target goal?
If we get less amount,  we’ll develop as many verbs as possible according to the resources available.

I saw many of these children in the clinic in La Gonave and heard stories from parents about how Medika Mamba saved their children's lives. These experiences were what truly inspired me to do this.

<p>My name is Edgar Vazquez and I am currently a senior majoring in both History and Anthropology at Texas Tech University. With your help I am hoping to raise funds and return to Belize in order to conduct archaeological fieldwork. In the summer of 2012 I was lucky enough to visit Belize for the first time and join the Chan Chich archaeological program hosted by Texas Tech. I will be returning in the summer of 2013 in order to gain more archaeological experience and doing what I love, while earning graduate school credit.</p>
<p>As a child I have always had an urging desire to become an archaeologist and hopefully one day discover something astonishing that would drastically change the archaeological world. Well, I’m a several years from doing anything along those lines. Every dream starts somewhere small. I have also made several lifelong friends from my first visit and I would love to grow as a person and future archaeologist with the ones who are returning.</p>
<p>During my first visit as an undergraduate student I had several scholarships and financial aid which allowed me to fund my trip without it becoming a financial burden on myself or my family. However, this time around I’m not as lucky. Being a fulltime student and working in order to not need student loans can be quite difficult and I have been extremely successful in doing this throughout my college career. However, I am faced with the difficulty of having to fund my return to the archaeological program in Belize and save up for graduate school. Thus any donation and contribute would be greatly appreciated and mean so much to me. Monetary and moral support is welcomed.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>With Your Help</strong></p>

<li>Program Fee: $1,800 for the regular session plus $250 for the extended session which make it a total of 29 nights.</li>
<li>Tuition:  Is roughly $1,850 for 6 hours</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been saving money for this trip and for graduate school which has been tough. I have already purchased my round trip plane ticket which was $720. I will also try to apply for any scholarships I can qualify for.</p>
<p>During the archaeological program I will be surveying, mapping/profiling, and excavating various sites. The program will also consist of trips to Maya ruins at Cahal Pech and Xunantunich and various other activities like horseback riding through the jungle and bird watching.  </p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if I don’t achieve my target goal the contributions I do receive will still be used from my trip. Everyone can help out just by sharing my page with friends, family, and on various social media outlets. I will be extremely grateful with any type of help! Spread the word and share! With your help I will be a step closer to achieving my dream and helping me continue my education. Contributions are also helping discover and better understand the history of the Maya Civilization which flourished in the region.</p>

I have been saving money for this trip and for graduate school which has been tough. I have already purchased my round trip plane ticket which was $720. I will also try to apply for any scholarships I can qualify for.
During the archaeological program I will be surveying, mapping/profiling, and excavating various sites. The program will also consist of trips to Maya ruins at Cahal Pech and Xunantunich and various other activities like horseback riding through the jungle and bird watching.  
 


Other Ways You Can Help
Even if I don’t achieve my target goal the contributions I do receive will still be used from my trip. Everyone can help out just by sharing my page with friends, family, and on various social media outlets. I will be extremely grateful with any type of help! Spread the word and share! With your help I will be a step closer to achieving my dream and helping me continue my education. Contributions are also helping discover and better understand the history of the Maya Civilization which flourished in the region.

My Story
 

My name is James Carey. I am the Producing Artistic Director of the ATTIC Theatre Conservatory in Los Angeles, CA. A position that I have had for 25 years. Last year I was invited by Zimbabwe's National Institute of Allied Arts to come to Africa and teach workshops in Acting and Dramatic Reading, and also to judge the national Speech and Drama Festival held every year for children 7 years of age to high school students. I was the first American to ever be offered this opportunity in the entire history of the Festival. 

Because of your generous help, I was able to go.

<p><span><span><span><strong>What is the VFX Learning Open Source Project and who is behind it?</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>My name is Luis Pages, I'm originally from Venezuela, for the last 10 years I have been a visual effects artist in the film industry. I'm a member of the Visual Effects Society and I have worked in over 12 feature films including Avatar, Harry Potter 5, Ice Age 2, John Carter and The Lovely Bones. You can see samples of my work here <a href=""http://www.solidanimations.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.solidanimations.com</a> .And learn more about my efforts to change the vfx industry here : <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lucasfilm-faces-new-pregnancy-discrimination-386863"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lucasfilm-faces-new-pregnancy-discrimination-386863</a></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Learn more about the VFX Learning Open Source Project in this video recording of our most recent <a href=""http://meet88487722.adobeconnect.com/p5sgvsbyfbu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Open House session.</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In winter of 2010 I founded <a href=""http://www.vfxlearning.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""VFX Learning"">VFX Learning</a> with the sole mission of creating high end training, mentored by artists actively working in the film industry, and delivering this sessions in English and Spanish, live anywhere in the world via our online classroom.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Since our launch we have been training students from every continent and has been a phenomenal experience. But at the same time it has been painful to receive hundreds of emails from students who cannot afford the cost of the courses but that are so passionate about what we do.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>This made me think about my start in this industry,how I had to work 2 jobs during the day and stay up most of the night on my dial-up internet connection hunting for any tutorial I could find, how hard it was to train and compete with artists coming from the big fancy schools, it didn't seem fair...</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>What I'm trying to accomplish with the VFX Learning Open Source Project is to give everyone regardless of their geographical location or financial situation a fighting chance.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I want the competition for those precious VFX film jobs to be fair. I want to give everyone the tools and knowledge they need to succeed in this business, and let creativity, imagination, talent, intelligence, hard work, desire and passion  be the determining factors in who makes it and who doesn't.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In order to achieve this I will stop operating VFX Learning under the current business model and instead we will run one last series of live mentored training with our supporters, this sessions will be recorded and released online for everyone to watch week after week until we complete the cycle.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I will release as Open Source all the courses that I personally teach, this means: <a href=""http://www.vfxlearning.com/about/video"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maya Dynamics level 1, level 2 and Master Class, Getting Wet with RealFlow</a>, as well as Igor Gonzalez course: <a href=""http://www.vfxlearning.com/about/video"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Intro to Maya for Effects.</a> All 5 courses both in English and Spanish (120 hours of video)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In order for this project to be successful I need to secure as much funding as possible to <span><span><span>allow me to <span><span><span><span><span><span>basically turn my business into a non profit open source content provider, </span></span></span></span></span></span>instead of selling it to an investor who will continue under the current model who only benefits those who can afford our courses.<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>We managed to secure $34882 with our previous campaign and this new campaign is just an extension of the donation period.</p>
<p><span><span><span>Your contributions will also help me cover the cost of production of the 120 hours of video training (10 courses, 12 hours of class per course, in 2 languages each) , the web servers to host and stream all the video material and online student community, supporting scene files for each course, tracking of live action plates for assignments, pay our instructors for their open source content, and cover the cost of software licenses offered as perks. Plus of course IndieGoGo and PayPal's commissions (between 7 to 12% together)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have created many different levels of donations each one with very interesting rewards. Describing each individual course will take too much space so thats why I have left the VFX Learning website intact as it is today while it stills operates as a business. This will give you an idea of what we do, how we do it, and what you and everyone else in the world will get in terms rewards in the form of training.</span></span></span></p>

<p> </p></div>","If you missed our deadline but still want to participate dont worry, we have created an extension of this campaign here: http://igg.me/p/393048/x/1896744
 
 This is an extension of our original campaign meant for students that missed the first deadline and still want to contribute. To learn more about our previous campaign  please visit www.indiegogo.com/vfxlearning
So far we have published the first 30 out of 120 hours of training videos. We are doing this  both in  English and Spanish. We need your support in order to help us keep bringing you this material, not only with donations but also spreading the word about the campaign and the training, the material speaks for itself and the more people that watches the videos the better. 
You can also learn more about each course topics and description and watch the recordings on our website www.vfxlearning.com/videos/opensource
 We also have a Vimeo channel where you can also see the entire list of recordings: http://vimeopro.com/vfxlearning/opensource
What is the VFX Learning Open Source Project and who is behind it?
My name is Luis Pages, I'm originally from Venezuela, for the last 10 years I have been a visual effects artist in the film industry. I'm a member of the Visual Effects Society and I have worked in over 12 feature films including Avatar, Harry Potter 5, Ice Age 2, John Carter and The Lovely Bones. You can see samples of my work here www.solidanimations.com .And learn more about my efforts to change the vfx industry here : http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lucasfilm-faces-new-pregnancy-discrimination-386863
http://vfxsoldier.wordpress.com
Learn more about the VFX Learning Open Source Project in this video recording of our most recent Open House session.
In winter of 2010 I founded VFX Learning with the sole mission of creating high end training, mentored by artists actively working in the film industry, and delivering this sessions in English and Spanish, live anywhere in the world via our online classroom.
Since our launch we have been training students from every continent and has been a phenomenal experience. But at the same time it has been painful to receive hundreds of emails from students who cannot afford the cost of the courses but that are so passionate about what we do.
This made me think about my start in this industry,how I had to work 2 jobs during the day and stay up most of the night on my dial-up internet connection hunting for any tutorial I could find, how hard it was to train and compete with artists coming from the big fancy schools, it didn't seem fair...
What I'm trying to accomplish with the VFX Learning Open Source Project is to give everyone regardless of their geographical location or financial situation a fighting chance.
I want the competition for those precious VFX film jobs to be fair. I want to give everyone the tools and knowledge they need to succeed in this business, and let creativity, imagination, talent, intelligence, hard work, desire and passion  be the determining factors in who makes it and who doesn't.
In order to achieve this I will stop operating VFX Learning under the current business model and instead we will run one last series of live mentored training with our supporters, this sessions will be recorded and released online for everyone to watch week after week until we complete the cycle.
What We Need & What You Get:
I will release as Open Source all the courses that I personally teach, this means: Maya Dynamics level 1, level 2 and Master Class, Getting Wet with RealFlow, as well as Igor Gonzalez course: Intro to Maya for Effects. All 5 courses both in English and Spanish (120 hours of video)
In order for this project to be successful I need to secure as much funding as possible to allow me to basically turn my business into a non profit open source content provider, instead of selling it to an investor who will continue under the current model who only benefits those who can afford our courses.
We managed to secure $34882 with our previous campaign and this new campaign is just an extension of the donation period.
Your contributions will also help me cover the cost of production of the 120 hours of video training (10 courses, 12 hours of class per course, in 2 languages each) , the web servers to host and stream all the video material and online student community, supporting scene files for each course, tracking of live action plates for assignments, pay our instructors for their open source content, and cover the cost of software licenses offered as perks. Plus of course IndieGoGo and PayPal's commissions (between 7 to 12% together)
I have created many different levels of donations each one with very interesting rewards. Describing each individual course will take too much space so thats why I have left the VFX Learning website intact as it is today while it stills operates as a business. This will give you an idea of what we do, how we do it, and what you and everyone else in the world will get in terms rewards in the form of training.
You can visit www.vfxlearning.com and see it for yourself. We also have a great Facebook community I'm devoted to this so I'm always available to answer any questions via email , the comments section or Skype. Ask and you shall receive :)
The Impact
If we are successful all of our contributions will give that kid in India or China, South America, Europe or Africa who sits and watches is awe how Iron Man and The Avengers save the world, or how Harry Potter defeats evil with so many cool tricks and spells, an opportunity to learn how this impressive imagery is done, and hopefully become the next generation of VFX Artists that with an open mind and warm heart will take our troubled and sometimes unfair industry into the place it deserves.
I hope that that other competitors of VFX Learning who have copied our method in the past will then follow us on this initiative. Is not easy to be the first in the water with this type of things, it changes dramatically the current paradigm and not everyone understands or agrees, but at least something is being done.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Don't worry if you cant contribute, you can help me immensely by spreading the word, tell everyone about this initiative so they can do the same. We all love movies so I'm sure someone you know will feel identified with my cause.
Also if any artists would like to contribute with course material, tutorials, etc please feel free to contact me.
If any VFX post-production houses, studios or software developers would like to participate in this project also feel free to drop me a line.

<p><strong>Note from Bryanna</strong></p>
<p>My name is Bryanna. I live in California. I'm a 10 year old student currently attending Janie P. Abbott Elementary.

It's a program that gives students like me an opportunity to discover and learn about America's history and government firsthand. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me to go on such an amazing and life-changing trip. I would love to go on this trip, but I can't because my parents are not able to afford this trip. So, I need your help to make my dream trip happen. You can donate little by little to help me with my goal. Please, pretty Please!! I will appreciate even the tiniest donation. I thank you in advance from the bottom of my heart. So, help my wish come <strong>ALIVE</strong>!!  </p>

The 21st Chromosome is one of 23 pairs found in us humans. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. The trisomy of the 21st chromosome (an extra little guy that's attached) causes Down Syndrome. Chromosome 21 is the smallest human chromosome, 47 million nucleotides (the building material of DNA) and representing about 1.5 percent of the total DNA in cells.
In 2000, researchers working on the Human Genome Project announced that they had determined the sequence of base pairs that make up this chromosome. Chromosome 21 was the second human chromosome to be fully sequenced. Pretty cool eh!

<h3>Helping Underserved Students Succeed!<em>  </em>
</h3>
<p>Urban Scholar Athletes (U.S.A.), a project of Community Partners, is a non-profit, community-based organization located in Los Angeles, California. Our mission is to transform the live of urban youth through academic enrichment, athletics, and community service opportunities.</p>
<p>Beginning in Fall 2012, U.S.A’s emerging program, <em>Urban Scholar Saturday Enrichment Academy</em>,  has provided opportunities for over fifty underserved youth in grades 1st-6th to enhance their knowledge of California standards in Math, Reading, and Science. Through fun &amp; engaging activities provided by certified teachers, Scholar Buck incentives, enrichment field-trips, and free books &amp; magazines, academy students were given the opportunity to develop critical thinking skills, make connections to the real-world, and develop self-confidence in their learning ability within the regular classroom setting.  Our thirty-week program also served as a platform for students to develop habits of volunteerism and a sense of social responsibility and civic awareness through community service opportunities. </p>
<p>As a result of the program’s success, both parents and scholars alike have reported a positive impact in the regular school setting and an improvement in self-esteem &amp; social skills. What began with a vision to transform the lives of urban youth, has now grown into a high merit program that is striving to expand its impact to over 100 scholars for the 2013-2014 academic year!</p>

In addition to being the top-of-the-line camera for summer filmmakers, this camera would be used to record workshops, field trips, events, and readings. *Two canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MPs SLR Camera, with Sigma 24-70 mm f/2.8 IF EX DG HSM AF Standard Zoom Lens. In addition to being used in the summer filmmaker program, these cameras would be utilized by students in other 826NYC workshops. * 4 Rode shotgun microphones. * 4 boom and mic sets. * Posters for each short  film.* Exclusive Erasers for Breakfast 2014 t-shirts for our students designed by the amazing folks at CBX branding agency.* Well designed and packaged DVDs for each student.Our Track RecordFor the past 7 summers, 826NYC students have gathered at our two centers to create close to 30 short films. Working with trained volunteers and industry professionals our students have consistent turned out well made, humorous shorts that we proudly screen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Rose Cinemas. We have helped inspire students like Alex, featured in the short above, to make a career in film their life's work. It's a goal he's taking seriously, building his portfolio with 826NYC and other organizations. He and the students featured in the embedded clips are just some of the young people we've helped inspire.

<p>The top allergy bloggers and advocates throughout Canada and the USA showed their support for our training fundraising initiative by appearing in our campaign video titled ""Anaphylaxis First Aid Training Is A Must"". Please click on the image above to view it. The script reads:</p>
<p><i>I support mandatory anaphylaxis first aid training and mandatory epinephrine kits in schools and daycares, and in all other places allergic people go. </i></p>
<p><i><i>An allergic emergency  can happen anywhere, and for 25% of the victims, they will not know they have allergies. </i></i></p>
<p><i><i>Restaurants, cafeterias, and food courts.</i></i></p>

<p><i><i>Gyms, community centers, and arenas.</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>Group homes, jails and prisons, and shopping malls.  </i></i></p>
<p><i><i>Hotels, resorts, and cruise ships, ALL need to be prepared to respond to an allergic emergency.</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>Why do I support this? </i></i></p>
<p><i><i>I support this because every year, about 1,500 people worldwide die from improperly treated allergic shock, anaphylaxis. Carrying an EpiPen and knowing how to use it is often not enough to save lives. Some people die with EpiPens still in their pocket, there’s much more to know.</i></i></p>

<p><i><i>How to act.</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>What to do next to preserve life, in the precious moments before it’s too late.</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>Every 6 minutes, someone with anaphylaxis  arrives at the emergency room. Sometimes it’s too late to save them. Without proper first aid BEFORE the ambulance comes, anaphylaxis can kill perfectly healthy children and adults, only because they were allergic.</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>One life lost is too many.</i></i></p>

<h2>Our Work</h2>To fill the gap between Allergists and their patients, I created Onespot Allergy Blog five years ago, and I've become the leading voice worldwide speaking to allergy safety and legal issues. My news feed fills up far too frequently with news of allergic injury and death, and I realized that there is a huge gap in the quality and consistency of allergy first aid training, so I partnered with Allergist Dr. Mark Greenwald and we created an online anaphylaxis first aid course. <b>Our hope is to help prevent the 1,500 lives lost worldwide each year to anaphylaxis by teaching the most prudent anaphylaxis first aid.</b> </span><br/><p></p>

It is the first day he has been left alone with anyone outside of our own family. He was diagnosed with multiple life threatening food allergies at the age of 18 months and because of that fact, this is the day I have been dreading for a very long time. We have taken every precaution possible and I feel very comfortable with the teachers, however I really needed to know that they had all the knowledge and preparation possible to deal with an anaphylactic emergency. I purchased several EpiCenter Medical training courses for the director of the preschool and the teachers. I feel this course gave them the knowledge and the confidence to properly care for my son and other children who have life threatening food allergies. My worst fears have been that a teacher might not recognize anaphylaxis or might be afraid to treat him quickly. This course addresses how to recognize anaphylaxis and also emphasizes the importance of treating quickly and properly. The amount and depth of knowledge that the course provides was actually shocking. I know that when I took the course I learned some new information as well! The director of the school felt that the information helped the staff tremendously and she has now purchased the course for the entire staff. I have always believed that the best way to keep my son safe is through education and knowledge. Thank you so much EpiCenter Medical for providing a very effective, thorough and accurate way to educate others about keeping my son safe! <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Thank you for all that you do EpiCenter Medical to help parents, teachers and children stay safe and confidently prepared! ~ </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Suzanne and Kory V. </span></i><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><i>I wanted to let you know that EpiCenter <a href=""http://www.epipentraining.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.epipentraining.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Epi-Pen online certification course</a> did a great job in teaching me how to identify the symptoms of anaphylaxis and what to do should I encounter someone under distress.

I think knowing how to identify the symptoms of anaphylaxis and the use of the EpiPen was a crucial component missing from the America Red Cross course that I took. The videos and the tests that were provided in your course reinforced many important concepts, and I feel much more comfortable as to what to do in such a situation. I have ordered a training EpiPen to practice the skills that I learned on the videos. I also like the two page protocol printout that you provided with the course; I had it laminated and now it is a part of my first aid sheets that I carry around with me to every one of the college classes I teach. At first, I was very scared that I had to teach classes before the college nurse was on duty, but your course and the American Red Cross course has made me feel more empowered should an unfortunate medical emergency take place. I think that all college professors should have training in Epi-Pen, because college campus are large and the school nurse, depending on her location on campus, could take up to 15+ minutes to get on the scene, which from the Epi-Pen course, we know often is already too late to take action. ~ </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Melissa</i></span></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">My Funding Goal &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">One licence for our course normally costs $30.00. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>For every $20 contributed to this campaign, I will provide two licences: One to train a teacher, AND ONE FOR YOU.

Thank God for loving parents that taught me the importance of caring for others, because of there kind heart, generous spirit and I'm deeply embedded spiritually, I'm able to work with low income families, addicts and the homeless, to business, spiritual and civic leaders in our community. During the 18 plus years has been involved with the Partnership Food Bank and the executive director of stop the violence movement, I operate an Emergency Food Pantry and commodity distribution site to serve individuals in need, distributing to 1500 families each month. It is my goal to see Caught Up The Intervention Game App/Board game in every school, youth camp/program, and churches. I am also creating two more intervention games coming out next year.Websitescaughtupthegame.wordpress.com",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Amie for The Shanti Project</div></div>","What is The Shanti Project's goal?
Honing in on the Bophas peoples' visions for their own lives and those of their children, The Shanti Project Income Generation Program is a direct response to community meetings we held in Jaisalmer in October and November of 2012 wherein the Bophis expressed their lack of means to provide for their families basic needs including but not limited to: education, housing, health care and nutritional deficits. The goal of the program is to equip them with jobs so that they can in turn equip their families. 
The Shanti Project's main marketing goal is to have a broad target market in the states and abroad to generate as much revenue as possible for the artisans currently involved, and so that we can expand to help other people. The Bophas will be producing sustainable crafts that lend a hand-up to the artisans who create them. The initial products that will be produced are bamboo flatware and up-cycled sari silk sleep sacks. We also have another line in the works that we are working on designs for that we hope to unveil soon.
The Shanti Project works with marginalized caste members between the ages of 14 and 60. Some demographic information that is relevant: 
>10% have schooling through sixth grade 
> 70% live in tarped structures/tents
> 80% struggle with food costs
>100% have a dream...


How did this project come to be?
The Shanti Project is a grassroots 501c3 organization that formed after a 2009 backpacking trip when Amie had the opportunity to get to know the Bopha women and subsequently found out about some of them having involvement with intergenerational prostitution. The last four years have been spent doing research and taking trips to India to further lay ground-work in the community as a learner and friend. It is our belief that to have a sustainable project, the project has to be under the ownership and the active vision of the people involved. Shanti seeks to promote the economic and social well-being of marginalized women and children; not only to break free the chains of poverty and prostitution, but to encourage empowerment.

With this said, it still means THE WORLD to us to have the support of those we love. Anything you can contribute would mean so much to us.

They are designed to give the Pi extra functionality.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pi-Top is built with using HATs in mind. Space has been built in so HATs can be programmed and used anywhere with Pi-Top. Pi-Top will be released with three world first HATs - all adding a huge layer of functionality.</p><p><b>1) Pi-Top LCD Hat</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F_8dFmKvmxdI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_8dFmKvmxdI&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F_8dFmKvmxdI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b><br/></b><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the problems Pi-Top solves is that Raspberry Pi users traditionally have to settle for small screen sizes if they want a mobile Pi. Our solution in Pi-Top was to create an HDMI to LVDS bridge PCB. We have used these designs to create an LCD HAT that will allow the Raspberry Pi Model B+ to connect to any LCD screen that has a single channel LVDS interface (which is usually anything less than 1400x1050 resolution). The LCD HAT makes it easy to make displays and a range of mobile devices.</p><p><b>2) Robot HAT </b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FlEnfshRIxpk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlEnfshRIxpk&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FlEnfshRIxpk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b><br/></b><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We set out to create the easiest, most accessible, compact and functional Raspberry Pi Robot in the world. The Robot HAT sits on top of the Raspberry Pi inside your Pi-Top. You code it using Python and the Pi-Top lesson plans. Then simply remove the Raspberry Pi from Pi-Top, clip on a 3D printed chassis and your robot is ready to go!</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In terms of functionality, the robot HAT gives you access to motor and servo drivers, digital-to-analogue converters, analog-to-digital converters, LEDs, IR proximity sensors and more. Due to how the HAT has been designed to clip into the 3D printed chassis, you will have access to other GPIOs so that you can customise the chassis to include even more sensors! The HAT also takes care of safely charging a lipo battery which keeps the Raspberry Pi running when you unclip it from Pi-Top.<br/></p><p><b>3) Home Automation HAT</b><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FRyyuDgYXdtQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DRyyuDgYXdtQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FRyyuDgYXdtQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b><br/></b><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have packed this HAT with loads of sensors so that you can retrieve information from the environment surrounding your Raspberry Pi, including pressure, humidity, temperature, touch, IR proximity and sound. The HAT also gives you access to several outputs, so that you can use the data you have collected to control the environment, including motor drives, a relay switch, a 7 segment digital readout and a buzzer. With this HAT you will be able to practice and learn how to use data collected by sensors to create automated devices.

WHAT IS PI-TOP?""Voila! A little open source computer for you and yours""  - TechCrunch""The days of home brew, DIY computer making are back, but in mutated form""- Vice: Motherboard""We just came across Pi-Top & fell in love."" - RS ComponentsPi-Top provides a platform to expand your knowledge in hardware creation. The kit takes you through each of its components and their functionality, so that you can use Pi-Top as a tool for your own projects in the future.Pi-Top focuses on teaching people how to create real hardware. Online and integrated lesson plans teach you how to understand electronics, create Printed Circuit Boards, and 3D print objects.Pi-Top comes with an injection moulded case so you can build Pi-Top on day one. Every kit also comes with 3D printing files so you can print your own Pi-Top case!  As a thank you to our eariest backers, ""Day One"" Pi-Top full kit contributors, will receive an extra FREE lazer cut acrylic slice with a unique design lazer etched into the acrylic! Only available to those backing us on 14th October.AS SEEN INEben Upton, founder of Raspberry Pi, talks with John Biggs at TechCrunch Disrupt Europe 2014 about Pi-TopWHO IS IT FOR?The Pi-Top kit is built with beginners in mind. Our goal is to make hardware as accessible as software is now, and a big part of that is making it beginner friendly. No soldering is required to build Pi-Top and a beginner should expect to be able to complete the kit in an evening. We want you to be able to create your own products and ideas. The Pi-Top kit is the start of a journey that will see you gaining the skills to build and code your own hardware.A gamified learning experience will take you to a stage where you are designing your own components and products. You will be able to work together on projects, contribute and help each other through the lesson plans and share your work with others.WHAT CAN I DO WITH PI-TOP?Pi-Top is here to give you the platform to learn how to create hardware. With Pi-Top you will gain the skills to make your ideas come to life.MAKE REAL HARDWAREPi-Top focuses on teaching you the key skills to start making real hardware products. By combining Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design and 3D Printing we give you the knowledge to create any hardware product you want to make – by giving you the skills to create you are only limited by your imagination!By using Pi-Top you will learn to make and control home automation devices, robots, and consumer electronics. We focus on teaching you transferable skills so that you can start making fast. We have trialled our learning process by traveling and teaching hardware innovation lessons to students around the UK.We recently taught a group of students at King Edwards school Birmingham, UK how to create an LED circuit – code it with the PI-Top; and then applying those core skills the students were able to control a Raspberry Pi Robot. By learning in this way, you can begin to create basic hardware after the first Pi-Top lesson.WHAT’S IN THE KIT? 1)  Injection molded case2)  3D printer STL files compatible for most print bed sizes (5"" x 5"" bed size and up)3)  PCBs - Power Management, HDMI to LVDS Bridge and Keyboard & Trackpad Controller.4)  Electronics breadboard5)  Battery6)  Keyboard7)  Trackpad8)  13.3”HD LCD Screen9)  Wifi adapter9)  Acrylic slice10)  Wiring11)  DC wall plug12)  Build instructions13)  Online & integrated lesson plansHATS!We love that Raspberry Pi has released the HAT specification, it opens up a huge range of added functionality. HATs are small addon boards you attach to the top of the Raspberry Pi. They are designed to give the Pi extra functionality.Pi-Top is built with using HATs in mind. Space has been built in so HATs can be programmed and used anywhere with Pi-Top. Pi-Top will be released with three world first HATs - all adding a huge layer of functionality.1) Pi-Top LCD HatOne of the problems Pi-Top solves is that Raspberry Pi users traditionally have to settle for small screen sizes if they want a mobile Pi. Our solution in Pi-Top was to create an HDMI to LVDS bridge PCB. We have used these designs to create an LCD HAT that will allow the Raspberry Pi Model B+ to connect to any LCD screen that has a single channel LVDS interface (which is usually anything less than 1400x1050 resolution). The LCD HAT makes it easy to make displays and a range of mobile devices.2) Robot HAT We set out to create the easiest, most accessible, compact and functional Raspberry Pi Robot in the world. The Robot HAT sits on top of the Raspberry Pi inside your Pi-Top. You code it using Python and the Pi-Top lesson plans. Then simply remove the Raspberry Pi from Pi-Top, clip on a 3D printed chassis and your robot is ready to go!In terms of functionality, the robot HAT gives you access to motor and servo drivers, digital-to-analogue converters, analog-to-digital converters, LEDs, IR proximity sensors and more. Due to how the HAT has been designed to clip into the 3D printed chassis, you will have access to other GPIOs so that you can customise the chassis to include even more sensors! The HAT also takes care of safely charging a lipo battery which keeps the Raspberry Pi running when you unclip it from Pi-Top.3) Home Automation HATWe have packed this HAT with loads of sensors so that you can retrieve information from the environment surrounding your Raspberry Pi, including pressure, humidity, temperature, touch, IR proximity and sound. The HAT also gives you access to several outputs, so that you can use the data you have collected to control the environment, including motor drives, a relay switch, a 7 segment digital readout and a buzzer. With this HAT you will be able to practice and learn how to use data collected by sensors to create automated devices. Learn to make hundreds of different products from this one HAT!PI-TOP CUSTOMIZATION 





Pi-Top is fully customisable! 3D print your own case on any 5"" x 5"" print bed, design and lazer cut custom Acrylic Slice's for your Pi-Top. Let your imagination run wild and make something completely unique to you!
WHY PI-TOP?

We think Pi-Top is a great platform to learn how to create hardware. Here's what others have said about Pi-Top. 
Mustafa is is the Manager of iMakr Store London, UK.
Rory is a Durham graduate with a degree in Electrical Engineering.
Aman attended the Pi-Top Hardware Lesson, part of the 225 Academy  learning experience.
START LEARNING
The Pi-Top Lesson plans will guide you through the complex world of hardware. We make 3D printing, printed circuit board design and building accessible. Pi-Top provides a clear pathway to progress and increase your abilities to create.


We have traveled the UK getting feedback from hundreds of students, educators and makers to bring Pi-Top to where it is today. We have redesigned Pi-Top based on hundreds of user comments from all across the maker community and we think it’s an amazing way to start learning about hardware.


All of our lesson plans will be available for free online. Pi-Top is just the start, we will be updating and creating gamified lesson plans as new technologies emerge and existing tech changes. With these lessons you will be able to start as a complete beginner and work towards advanced projects, working with others and earning experience/ rewards along the way. We want people to learn how to make anything and have fun doing it.
ANY CLASS, ANY ROOM, ANYWHERE


Pi-Top is mobile! With 6 – 8 hours battery life, a built in Keyboard trackpad and 13.3” screen, Pi-Top makes learning with the Raspberry Pi easier than ever. No need for HDMI monitors, USB keyboards & mice. Pi-Top opens the power of learning with Raspberry Pi to any class, any room, anywhere you want!


OUR STORY
Ryan and I met just over 8 months ago and this is what has happened so far:

With the help of David Robinson we create the first prototype rendersWe create the first Pi-Top Prototypes. They're a little rough around the edges but we love them!Creating the final PCB designsWe test our first prototype PCBs, and start creating the 3D print case designWe start to teach Hardware Innovation lessons with the first 3D printed Pi-Top and receive feedback on how to improve the design.We talked to hundreds of students and parents to see how we could improve Pi-Top as a makers toolWe visit Makerspaces to get feedback on the Pi-Top. After receiving lots of feedback, we complete the final Pi-Top prototype ready for productionPreparing for our Indiegogo launch!

It is made up of exceptional young people who have lived an arsenal of stories to become the kids we love and work alongside every day. That is especially true of our teen program. The teen program is made up of exceptional young people. People who are loving, kind, strong and intelligent. They are also the people who are often forgotten, underrated, undervalued and discounted. That's not the case, however, at The Boys & Girls Club. We see these teens for the exceptional people that they really are. We hold them to the standards of what we know they have inside of them. We hold them to the standards of leaders, innovators and pillars of the community. Time and time again, they prove us right.While our teens come from all different walks of life, the most common theme is that they all make the choice to show up. And sometimes, that's the hardest decision for someone to make. We have teens who are survivors of gang violence, domestic abuse, of parental substance abuse, and yet they still find the strength in themselves to make the choice to show up every day and work to actively make a difference not only in their lives but the lives of others. Many of our kids while they are kind, loving people have been forced to grow up far too fast.

I started staying there after the Youth leadership program that i attended in 2012. Kufunda Village started supporting me when i was still at school by providing my school fees. I wrote my exams in 2010 but i did not manage to get my results because i couldn't afford to pay the exam fee. I stayed for the whole year doing nothing at home, even the hope of that i can do something was dying. I was invited to the youth leadership program and it has transformed my whole life. It made me to be able to define myself and know what i want with clear intentions. At Kufunda i am involved in different projects but most strongly in the art of hosting, the communiversity and I am taking the lead in our recycling and upcyling project.

We want to help change this by supporting Student 4 Charity, a Swedish student organisation helping children worldwide to get a better outlook on life.  Why? Because we believe everyone should have the chance to easily access education. </p><p>After travelling to the Philippines last year I saw real poverty for the first time. It was here that I visited a slum in Cebu City, and made friends with a 9 year old boy, Rafael. He explained to us that he worked from morning until night, gardening for the rich so he could earn just $2 a day. To my surprise he then happily spent that money on school supplies. This made me realise: Education is not granted!</p><p>I felt it was about time I tried to help bring about a change here. Seeing families, living with more than 14 people in a small wooden shelter, trying to make a living each day, and taking care of their elders, made me realise that they could not escape from the cycle without help from the outside. This is particularly bad in the Philippines, but also a huge problem world-wide.</p><p>Student 4 Charity is a local organisation in Lund, Sweden, that was started four years ago. The organisation is run by students and the purpose is to make education more accessible in third world countries. They have already built a school in Kenya in 2012 and now have their aim on Miacao, Colombia. Miacao is a remote village in northern Colombia where the children have no access to any education and in August this year, Students for Charity is going to change that. With the support of a large charity organisation called Ankarstiftelsen that will help with the administration and running of the school after, the members of Students 4 Charity will travel to Miacao and build the school. We want to help them to make that happen!</p><p>And do you know what the best thing is? Students 4 Charity don't need any administration fee or anything. 100% of what they're raising goes straight into to project and the kids down there in Columbia.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/long-way-to-school/contributions/new"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ALRIGHT, I CAN AFFORD TO CHUCK IN A FEW BUCKS!</a></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/532504/files/20140425014144-IMG_1803.JPG?1398415304"" src="""" style=""width: 586.667px; height: 440px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/532505/files/20140425014208-IMG_1810.JPG?1398415328"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/532510/files/20140425014403-IMG_1811.JPG?1398415443"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><h3></h3><h2>WHAT do we want to do to change that?</h2><p></p><p> As Joseph and I are still students, trying to finish our degrees at the moment, we need to give something else other than money and we are more than happy to do so.

Four entire days of living in the wild, climbing Sweden's highest mountain and hike endless tracks whilst using only schoolbags and only what we can put inside these.

<p>Auf der ganzen Welt gibt es Kinder, die dadurch, dass sie in entlegenen Regionen wohnen, täglich Stunden nur für den Schulweg auf sich nehmen müssen. Wir wollen helfen das zu ändern, indem wir Spenden für die schwedische Organisation Students 4 Charity sammeln, die weltweit Kindern dabei hilft, einen besseres Leben haben zu können. Warum? Weil wir glauben, dass ein jeder das Recht auf Bildung besitzt!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Während ich letztes Jahr die Philippinen bereiste, habe ich zum ersten Mal in meinem Leben echte Armut erlebt. Als wir ein Slum in Cebu City besuchten, lernte ich den 9-jährigen Rafael kennen, der sich damit brüstete den ganzen Tag bei reicheren Leuten im Garten arbeiten zu dürfen. Mit den $2, die er dabei verdiente, war er glücklich Hefte und Stifte für die Schule kaufen zu können um irgendwann auchmal da zu wohnen, wo die Reichen wohnen dürften. Mit den Eindrücken, die ich bereits im Hinterkopf hatte und dem dumpfen Gefühl, dass auch der Tag einmal käme an dem Rafaels Träume der Realität begegneten, realisierte ich, dass nachhaltige Bildung einfach nicht selbstverständlich ist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ich hatte das Gefühl Rafael helfen zu wollen, aber fühlte mich ohnmächtig. Auch im weiteren Verlauf meiner Reise zu sehen, wie viele Menschen auf den Philippinen teils mit einem Dutzend Angehörigen in kleinen, hölzernen Verschlägen leben und wie sehr sich ihr Leben nur um das Verdienen des täglichen Brotes dreht, brachte mich zu der Einsicht, dass jenen kein Entkommen aus diesem Teufelskreis ermöglicht wird, wenn man nicht von außen etwas tut. Dies ist nicht nur auf den Philippinen ein ernst zu nehmendes Problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Students 4 Charity ist dabei eine in Lund, Schweden, ansässige Organisation, die ihre Arbeit vor vier Jahren aufgenommen hat. Sie wird von Studenten betrieben und hat das Ziel, Bildung in dritte Welt Ländern besser erreichbar und verfügbar zu machen. Ein erster Erfolg war dabei die Errichtung einer Schule in Kenya, 2012, welches als Beispiel für das diesjährige Projekt in Miacao, Kolumbien, dient. Miacao ist ein abgelegenes Dorf in Nord-Kolumbien wo Kinder bisher keinerlei Zugang zu Bildung besitzen. Im August diesen Jahres will Students 4 Charity dies ändern! Unter er Federführung von der schwedischen Organisation Ankarstiftelsen, die die Schule nach Errichtung betreiben wird, werden die Mitglieder von Students 4 Charity im August selber nach Kolumbien fahren, um dort der Gemeine Miacao eine Schule zu errichten.</p>
<p>Wir wollen ihnen dabei helfen und Geld für dieses einzigartige Projekt sammeln! </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>WAS wollt ihr machen um das zu ändern?</h2>
<p>
</p><p>Da Joseph und ich derzeit noch Studenten sind, wollen wir etwas Anderes als Geld geben! Unser Plan ist es, Aufmerksamkeit zu erzeugen, die wir auf diese Probleme lenken wollen und am besten macht man das mit einer verrückten Idee, oder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1800km nördlich von Malmø gehts dann auf den längsten Schulweg, den Schweden wahrscheinlich jeh gesehen hat!

We do this because we believe it is for a good cause!*TAX REFUNDABLE*just tick the  box next to your email address to get a receipt.:deutsche version weiter unten:..: Follow our trip on FACEBOOK :.WHY would we go to all this trouble?All around the world there are children living in remote locations who daily, endure hours of walking just to get to their nearest school. We want to help change this by supporting Student 4 Charity, a Swedish student organisation helping children worldwide to get a better outlook on life.  Why? Because we believe everyone should have the chance to easily access education. After travelling to the Philippines last year I saw real poverty for the first time. It was here that I visited a slum in Cebu City, and made friends with a 9 year old boy, Rafael. He explained to us that he worked from morning until night, gardening for the rich so he could earn just $2 a day. To my surprise he then happily spent that money on school supplies. This made me realise: Education is not granted!I felt it was about time I tried to help bring about a change here. Seeing families, living with more than 14 people in a small wooden shelter, trying to make a living each day, and taking care of their elders, made me realise that they could not escape from the cycle without help from the outside. This is particularly bad in the Philippines, but also a huge problem world-wide.Student 4 Charity is a local organisation in Lund, Sweden, that was started four years ago. The organisation is run by students and the purpose is to make education more accessible in third world countries. They have already built a school in Kenya in 2012 and now have their aim on Miacao, Colombia. Miacao is a remote village in northern Colombia where the children have no access to any education and in August this year, Students for Charity is going to change that. With the support of a large charity organisation called Ankarstiftelsen that will help with the administration and running of the school after, the members of Students 4 Charity will travel to Miacao and build the school. We want to help them to make that happen!And do you know what the best thing is? Students 4 Charity don't need any administration fee or anything. 100% of what they're raising goes straight into to project and the kids down there in Columbia.ALRIGHT, I CAN AFFORD TO CHUCK IN A FEW BUCKS!WHAT do we want to do to change that? As Joseph and I are still students, trying to finish our degrees at the moment, we need to give something else other than money and we are more than happy to do so. Our plan is to draw attention towards these issues through this crazy idea and get as many supporters on board as we can. Everyone can help these children - especially you! 1800km northwards of Malmo, we will start the longest trip to school Sweden has ever seen! Four entire days of living in the wild, climbing Sweden's highest mountain and hike endless tracks whilst using only schoolbags and only what we can put inside these. All of this only to raise attention and get pictures around the globe that make people aware of this issue! That's the deal!Man that's awesome, I'd love to support you!WHAT'S the big deal I hear you say?  Usually for a trip such as this you would carry a large amount of equipment in a backpack that can hold anything up to 90litres. By using just a school bag we are limiting ourselves to around only 12litres of storage dramatically reducing the amount of equipment we can carry. Over a four-day hike it will take careful planning to carry only what we need to survive. We will have to forget most modern day luxuries that hikers are now used too.WHERE do we want to do that?  The aim is the Kebnekaise, Sweden's highest mountain massif which rises 2106m (6909ft) from the frozen Nordic ground. Being situated nearly 150km north of the border to the polar circle, the Kebnekaise consists of two summits offering one of northern Europe’s most magnificent views of Sweden. It is a dangerous peak often shrouded with bad weather and poor visability.Here, where the night lasts up to 19 hours during winter, and the snow of the arctic never really melts, people have made surviving possible through several huts along the way in case the weather changes too quickly.Serious, I always got a couple of bucks for that stuff!CAN we have some more details?

Day 1   Arriving in Kiruna, taking the Bus Nikkaluokta, camping somwhere in the wilderness 

Day 2   Getting up early, putting on the equipment and leaving for the 26km roundtrip to the summit and back

Day 3   Continuing hiking in the area

Day 4   Getting back to Kiruna and flying out to Stockholm

WHAT experience do you got?

Joseph as well as myself (Lucas) have been travelling/backpacking/hiking in many areas around the world to be confident enough to bring this attempt to success.

While I specifically have experience in climbing/mountaineering, Joseph is the Swedish mastermind behind all that. As a local he will make things easy, being used to the Swedish wilderness and - of course - the people.





HOW will you use the money raised?  

As we are trying to get as much money for a good cause together as we possibly can - of course, we will only deduct the travel expenses up to Kiruna, from where our journey starts. To be honest, as we both are still students and funding our lifes with part time jobs on little hours, that's the only way to do it. I hope you will understand this.

In case there is not enough for us being collected, we will donate the whole amount received by Students 4 Charity.




DON'T have anything on you just now? - There are many ways to help!  

Money isn’t the only support we need!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Rena’s Promise International Creative Writing Camp is a one week 
intensive writing program for young people between the ages of 14-17, 
									who want to explore their own unique gifts as writers in prose 
and poetry, fiction and nonfiction in a camp setting with other serious 
teenage 
									writers. <br/></p>
<p>Created to further the vision of Holocaust survivor Rena 
Kornreich Gelissen and in honor of her memory, Rena’s promise is a 
promise to 
									create a more ecumenical world unhindered by prejudice, racism 
or hatred by bringing young people together from all walks of life and 
									providing them with a place to develop the cultural and 
creative voices of Generation NEXT.</p>Quinipet Retreat Center on Shelter Island is where our campers come to spend their week. Afternoons are a combination of meeting professional 
writers and enjoying all the Hamptons has to offer--swimming, kayaking, bonfires, cook outs and sleeping under the pines. This is a true sleep 
									away camp experience devoted to giving young people the space 
to write and explore writing among like-minded people.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>Our budget is small--normally we raise 2,000.00 per year but last year we ran into the red and need to raise more money to support our scholarship fund. The largest portion of our budget goes to Quinipet Retreat Center, which provides a house, nursing facility and cafeteria. Our second largest expense if paying our professional writers to take a week out of their lives and come teach at our program and they teach two classes per day, offer one-on-one critiques and often give advice and references for college and scholarships. Lastly, we have insurance, field trips to theatre events and art museums, and transportation costs.<ul>
<li>Full Scholarship for one camper is $1000.00--we give out 2 per year, but
 would like to have 5 this year, so we can reach more teens in need.</li>

The Rena’s Promise International Creative Writing Camp is a one week 
intensive writing program for young people between the ages of 14-17, 
									who want to explore their own unique gifts as writers in prose 
and poetry, fiction and nonfiction in a camp setting with other serious 
teenage 
									writers. 
Created to further the vision of Holocaust survivor Rena 
Kornreich Gelissen and in honor of her memory, Rena’s promise is a 
promise to 
									create a more ecumenical world unhindered by prejudice, racism 
or hatred by bringing young people together from all walks of life and 
									providing them with a place to develop the cultural and 
creative voices of Generation NEXT.Quinipet Retreat Center on Shelter Island is where our campers come to spend their week. Afternoons are a combination of meeting professional 
writers and enjoying all the Hamptons has to offer--swimming, kayaking, bonfires, cook outs and sleeping under the pines. This is a true sleep 
									away camp experience devoted to giving young people the space 
to write and explore writing among like-minded people.


What We Need 
Our budget is small--normally we raise 2,000.00 per year but last year we ran into the red and need to raise more money to support our scholarship fund. The largest portion of our budget goes to Quinipet Retreat Center, which provides a house, nursing facility and cafeteria. Our second largest expense if paying our professional writers to take a week out of their lives and come teach at our program and they teach two classes per day, offer one-on-one critiques and often give advice and references for college and scholarships. Lastly, we have insurance, field trips to theatre events and art museums, and transportation costs.
Full Scholarship for one camper is $1000.00--we give out 2 per year, but
 would like to have 5 this year, so we can reach more teens in need.
We give out 10-15 Partial Scholarships each year to campers giving $200-600.00 to each partial scholarship request.
We also try to support international students with either a full scholarship, so they only have to pay travel expenses.

All students accepted into camp immediately receive a $100.00 scholarship.


What You Get 

Knowledge that young people who often come from difficult 
circumstances are in a place where they are supported emotionally and 
intellectually in a way they have probably not experienced before.
Comfort
 in knowing that inner city participants may not only be seeing a deer 
for the first time in their lives, but are writing about their lives in 
powerful and important ways.
Assurance that our writers are not censored and can express themselves in ways not normally allowed in secondary schools
Confidence
 that our writers are developing their voices, learning that their 
voices are important, and will take their voices into the world to make 
the world a better place
Peace in knowing that every camper is 
introduced to the idea of living together in peace and supporting each 
other despite economic and cultural differences--for many of our campers
 this is the first time they meet young people from other cultures and 
find a common thread and bond that is unbreakable.

With both a tutoring and a mentoring program, Student2Student’s goal is to create a program that instills respect, in addition to other core values that will support minorities to take pride in their culture and succeed further in life.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We provide tutoring and mentoring on a reliable schedule using near-peer pairings both in person and online in the Greater Philadelphia area. </p>

<p>Our programs include sending students and mentors to schools, after-school care centers, and other youth-oriented facilities that are easily accessible, as well as an online element based on convenience.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will emphasize the importance of proper preparation for transitions between various levels of education. For example, programs will target the transition between elementary and middle school, middle school and high school, and high school to college. Our proactive efforts intend to provide the following positive outcomes: keeping young students of color focused on their education, lowering the rates of violence and arrest conviction, increasing the rate of enrollment in colleges and universities among minorities, and graduate young men and women from high school and college and empower them to join the labor market and/or different businesses.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Mentoring and tutoring will be conducted through a voluntary basis. Mentors and tutors will go through training to make sure that they qualify to be a part of the growth of the young men and women who are enrolled in the program.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The end result would be for every student who comes through the program to gain a sense of love for learning and support needed to increase the likelihood that a successful future is achievable. We want to motivate and push the youth to want to work towards excellence in all aspects of their lives and to let them know that setbacks can be a part of the process, but that they should never give up. We want to help these young children expand the rate of graduation from high school to get into college, and not only to obtain a college degree but also change the perspective of minorities, and the perception of them by others. By doing this it will hopefully start a generational trend that will be much more positive than the current one.</p>

<h3>McRae-Gaines Learning Center, 1978 to present</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>McRae-Gaines Learning Center is an historic school
founded in 1978 in Selma, Alabama, to serve “the least to the greatest…” Since McRae-Gaines
opened its doors, the teachers and staff at McRae have committed more than just
their time and talents to the children who have filed through their classrooms.
All three of the Directors have worked tirelessly during their tenures to fulfill
the mission of the school, often foregoing their own salaries in order to make
ends meet. And the teachers themselves have gone without pay to ensure that the
children received the quality education designed by the Founding Directors in “Pathway
to College,” the McRae curriculum.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>In spite of a precarious financial situation
throughout its almost 40 year history the school’s contribution to confident
and prepared students in their continued education is measurable and
significant.  Graduates from McRae-Gaines have continued their studies in
colleges and universities throughout the United States.  Today, these
students serve their communities as teachers, lawyers, doctors, engineers,
architects, community developers, government officials and in many other
professions.</p>

<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Earthrise Space Foundation is all about Science, Technology, Engineering, &amp; Math (STEM) outreach and we
want to promote STEM education using Sagan. Sagan has been designed so that while we prepare him for his
trip to the moon he can teach students of all ages in the topics of robotics,
space, and engineering. The Earthrise Space Foundation has personally
hosted over 80 interns and has reached out to over 500 middle
and high school students, providing them with valuable work
experience in the expanding field of space exploration.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813807/files/20140826113225-gotham_new.png?1409077945"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div style=""text-align: justify;"">We realize that STEM education is not being promoted enough to young children and students. As a way of solving this problem we are launching this campaign and will be using Sagan to educate people in a fun and creative way. This is a story of a robot and his creator Carla as they go on an adventure to the moon. Although it seems like a simple children's book, Sagan's Quest is educational and will spark an interest in STEM for not only young children but everyone who reads it! This book is sure to become an instant classic once it's released!</div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How The Funds Will Be Used</h2><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/821235/files/20140829123247-funds.png?1409340767"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>

Our first book is in the final stages of its production and details Carla's creation of Sagan and her inspiration to send him to the moon. The second book in our series is also well into development and is all about Carla preparing Sagan for his journey. She wants to make sure that Sagan is ready for his flight and is excited to send him on his way. Our third installment in the trilogy centers on Sagan as he is on the moon and is exploring its fascinating terrain. All of the books are filled with educational yet engaging material that will spark an interest with children and will also teach them about STEM and space! </p>

</div></div>","Our Purpose

The Earthrise Space Foundation is all about Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math (STEM) outreach and we
want to promote STEM education using Sagan. Sagan has been designed so that while we prepare him for his
trip to the moon he can teach students of all ages in the topics of robotics,
space, and engineering. The Earthrise Space Foundation has personally
hosted over 80 interns and has reached out to over 500 middle
and high school students, providing them with valuable work
experience in the expanding field of space exploration.We realize that STEM education is not being promoted enough to young children and students. As a way of solving this problem we are launching this campaign and will be using Sagan to educate people in a fun and creative way. This is a story of a robot and his creator Carla as they go on an adventure to the moon. Although it seems like a simple children's book, Sagan's Quest is educational and will spark an interest in STEM for not only young children but everyone who reads it! This book is sure to become an instant classic once it's released!How The Funds Will Be Used

Earthrise Space Foundation Accomplishments to Date 
The
Foundation is proud of its numerous accomplishments. Some of these are listed
below:



Provided support to senior level
students’ projects, at the University of Central Florida (UCF), to design
spacecraft hardware.


Engaged over 80 interns with the
assistance of Workforce Central Florida and UCF.

Reached out to over 500 middle and high
school students through facility tours, presentations and outreach programs.
Involved in workshops and networking
events to help advance the technology community and provide experience to both
personnel and students.
Awarded the Congressional Rising Star in
Technology in 2013 by Congressman Bill Posey in recognition of the success and
benefit to the regional technology community.


3D Render Concept of Sagan




Take a Sneak Peak of Our Book!












*We will release the first 10 pages of the story through the campaign. The entire book will be available by November 2014.

Sagan's Quest is going to be a book series! Our first book is in the final stages of its production and details Carla's creation of Sagan and her inspiration to send him to the moon. The second book in our series is also well into development and is all about Carla preparing Sagan for his journey. She wants to make sure that Sagan is ready for his flight and is excited to send him on his way. Our third installment in the trilogy centers on Sagan as he is on the moon and is exploring its fascinating terrain. All of the books are filled with educational yet engaging material that will spark an interest with children and will also teach them about STEM and space!

<p>Last summer, I worked as an intern at an <strong><em>NGO on development and social services</em></strong>.

I taught several art classes to young people ranging in age from 2 to 18 years old. I loved teaching the idea, “If you can imagine something, you can create it, so why not imagine big?!” Then I decided I wanted one J-O-B, full-time stability with benefits, like a “real” adult might have, and I got one. In 2013 I began working with adults with developmental disabilities and I found my real passion; seeing people for their attributes and capabilities, and reflecting their authentic power back to them. This changed the dynamic of my work environment, made my client interactions invigorating, and left me wanting more. How could I make my life around this passion and how could I share it? I had one coaching session with my amazing coach and friend Mara Connolly and knew coaching was my “it!” So far I have paid for and completed all of the courses to fill the prerequisites for certification and I’m currently building my coaching business. Throughout this journey, I have received so much love and support for all of my dreams from my family, friends, and communities.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p></p><p><span>Being “young” has been my number one challenge in getting my business off the ground. I am simultaneously fine-tuning my coaching skills and learning how to be a small business owner. It is a pretty sharp learning curve. I have been asked and have wrestled with the question, “What could a 25 year old possibly have to give as a coach?” The answer is quite simple: I love life, I love people, I have hope, and I have skills that move people. I believe in you, your dreams, and in your capability to achieve them. Certification will make my coaching more impactful, as well as provide accreditation. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Dreaming with Intention</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><span>I am out to empower the world one person and one small group at a time. My truth is that when people live from their authentic selves they inspire those around them to do the same. While I can never truly know what is in store for me, there are a few dreams I am working towards.</span></p><p><span>One of these dreams is to bring coaching into organizations that serve adults living with disabilities. The intention is to partner with staff and administration knowing that when people are living rooted in their values they bring purposeful living with them to work, and in turn to their clients. A large part of coaching is seeing a person as naturally creative, resourceful, and whole. I am excited to explore the ideas of wholeness within organizations that serve adults living with disabilities.</span><br/></p><p>Another one of my dreams is to open a ranch serving as a completely inclusive community offering life skills workshops and camps, artist residencies, scientific and technological exploration and invention, business retreats, and sustainable agricultural endeavors. The Coaches Training Institute also offers a Leadership program that I will eventually attend.

I taught several art classes to young people ranging in age from 2 to 18 years old. I loved teaching the idea, “If you can imagine something, you can create it, so why not imagine big?!” Then I decided I wanted one J-O-B, full-time stability with benefits, like a “real” adult might have, and I got one. In 2013 I began working with adults with developmental disabilities and I found my real passion; seeing people for their attributes and capabilities, and reflecting their authentic power back to them. This changed the dynamic of my work environment, made my client interactions invigorating, and left me wanting more. How could I make my life around this passion and how could I share it? I had one coaching session with my amazing coach and friend Mara Connolly and knew coaching was my “it!” So far I have paid for and completed all of the courses to fill the prerequisites for certification and I’m currently building my coaching business. Throughout this journey, I have received so much love and support for all of my dreams from my family, friends, and communities.ChallengesBeing “young” has been my number one challenge in getting my business off the ground. I am simultaneously fine-tuning my coaching skills and learning how to be a small business owner. It is a pretty sharp learning curve. I have been asked and have wrestled with the question, “What could a 25 year old possibly have to give as a coach?” The answer is quite simple: I love life, I love people, I have hope, and I have skills that move people. I believe in you, your dreams, and in your capability to achieve them. Certification will make my coaching more impactful, as well as provide accreditation. Dreaming with IntentionI am out to empower the world one person and one small group at a time. My truth is that when people live from their authentic selves they inspire those around them to do the same. While I can never truly know what is in store for me, there are a few dreams I am working towards.One of these dreams is to bring coaching into organizations that serve adults living with disabilities. The intention is to partner with staff and administration knowing that when people are living rooted in their values they bring purposeful living with them to work, and in turn to their clients. A large part of coaching is seeing a person as naturally creative, resourceful, and whole. I am excited to explore the ideas of wholeness within organizations that serve adults living with disabilities.Another one of my dreams is to open a ranch serving as a completely inclusive community offering life skills workshops and camps, artist residencies, scientific and technological exploration and invention, business retreats, and sustainable agricultural endeavors. The Coaches Training Institute also offers a Leadership program that I will eventually attend. Coaching and leadership hold the founding principles of these two dreams and any “extra” money will go into a fund to support them. Your contribution not only allows me to pursue these dreams, it also builds the foundation and platform to empower (hopefully) thousands of lives.Your Perks!I am so excited to bring these offerings to you!I am offering coaching and various coaching paths, a sticker, postcards, paintings, and a coloring journey!

<p>My name is Saoirse, I'm 16 and I grew up in Asia where my parents run a mission group called Autumn Rain International (ARI). ARI mostly helps deliver Bibles to Christians in their own language, but also helps with micro-enterprise and sponsorship programmes. I will be making a trip with my Dad to north India at the end of October.</p>
<p>This trip is especially significant for me because for the past year, I have been sponsoring a young girl in Nagaland, in north east India. My little sister is also sponsoring a child who I'll also be meeting. These girls were unable to attend school due to hardship. It's been wonderful to see them in their school uniforms and hearing about how they are doing well in their exams.</p>
<p>But recently, we got some bad news about the little girl I am sponsoring, Sarah . She got really sick with typhoid and malaria. Her personality changed from being cheerful and carefree to sad and withdrawn. The family we work with in Nagaland arranged for medical treatment for her, and it became apparent that Sarah had been sexually abused. Sarah hasn't been able to talk about it, but she's mentioned that ""strange men"" have been coming to the house at night. We suspect that Sarah's step-father has actually been pimping her out.</p>
<p>Now we are arranging for Sarah to be sponsored by our partner family. So please help me to continue to help her and to go and meet her. When Sarah heard we were coming, she was so happy. After all that she has been through, this is a significant time for us to meet.</p>

<p>So here's what I need:</p>
<p>* First of all, your prayer support!</p>

My parents sponsored Salome's education and now she has a Master's Degree in Community Development. It is Salome who actually set up the sponsorship programme through ARI that my sister and I are now sponsoring girls through. We know that assisting girls to remain in education is one of the best ways to protect them from sex trafficking, forced and early marriage, and other forms of exploitation. It is the best way to help break the cycle of poverty. Through Sarah's situation, this has become very real to us.</p>
</div><div><p>I am very excited about this opportunity to meet with Salome, as the team leader of the sponsorship programme, and Sarah, my sponsor girl.

Our Story


Languatica was founded with the idea to make language
learning a fun and entertaining experience for everyone. We offer programs that combine language classes with activities such as yoga, surfing, salsa dancing, sailing, tennis, golf and polo to prove that Language Learning is FUN! We offer programs in South America, North America, Europe and Asia.

Our company recently partnered with several language
technology and travel start-up companies in New York City to create a more entertaining and
practical language learning program which combines technology and in-country
language immersion.
We are one of the British Airways Face of Opportunity Contest Winners 
and our company was featured and quoted in USA Today, ABC News and Global Traveler 
Magazine. Visit our News to take a peak!



The importance of language learning:



helps you to expand your view of the world
encourages critical reflection on the relation between language and culture, language and thought
expands your opportunities for meaningful leisure activities (such as travel, viewing foreign language films, watching foreign TV programs)
develops your intellect (encouraging good learning habits, memorization, combining course content and skills in a meaningful way)
improves knowledge of the native language (through comparison and contrast with the foreign language)
exposes you to modes of thought and viewpoints that are available only in the foreign language and its culture
helps to build practical skills that may be used in other disciplines
fosters your understanding of the interrelation between language and human nature
teaches and encourages respect for other ethnic groups
contributes to the development of your personality
contributes to the achievement of national goals, such as economic development or national security
increases your sense of self worth. Speaking Italian or Spanish to your grandmother or ordering in French at a French restaurant will do wonders for your ego!

<p><strong>***UPDATE***</strong></p>
<p><strong>9/6/12 - There is an anonymous donor who has agreed to match $10,000 if we can raise the first $10,000 of this fundraiser. Anyone and everyone, if you can help out wherever you can, it would really help CJ and his family.  </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our friend CJ was recently diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (cancer within the bone marrow) at the age of 24. He is currently at a hospital to undergo aggressive Chemotherapy Treatments where his insurance is considered out of network. The estimated cost may be well over $30,000 out of pocket for the initial chemotherapy treatmentsand some of the procedures aren't covered. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rapid cancer that starts inside bone marrow. Persons with this type of cancer have abnormal cells inside their bone marrow. The cells grow very fast, and replace healthy blood cells. The bone marrow, which helps the body fight infections, eventually stops working correctly. Persons with AML become more prone to infections and have an increased risk for bleeding as the numbers of healthy blood cells decrease.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CJ comes from a large family of a loving mom and dad, and a total of 9 brothers and sisters. The Peterson family has given so much to people unconditionally and we would like to start a fundraiser for CJ and his family to help offset some of the costs of the medical treatments and medical expenses. It would be nice for his mom to fly to Salt Lake City to visit CJ since mom and dad lives in Chicago. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Brad and David are great friends with CJ, and our friendship started over the sport of Triathlons. David originally didn't have any idea how to swim, CJ was an athlete that excelled in the sport of Triathlons and was able to teach David how to swim. This eventually lead to CJ Finishing the St. George Ironman in 2011 and David finishing three 140.6 mile Ironman Triathlons including last year's 2011 Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brad and David have decided to race in November at Ironman Florida 2012 in honor of CJ and his battle to beat Acute Myeloid Leukemia. We hope to inspire friends, family and individuals around the world to give towards CJ's initial medical treatments of chemotherapy through his love of Triathlons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you everyone if you can be of any help.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What we're up to:</strong></p>
<p>The Rosehips medics are preparing for travel to <strong>offer free medical support </strong>at mass protests of the Democratic and Republican National Conventions in Charlotte, NC and Tampa, FL (Aug 27th-Sept 6th). In 2008, Collective members offered vital Good Samaritan and harm reduction care to Convention protestors—and this election year (which promises another wave of popular protest) the Rosehips will again present basic assessment, first aid, and emergency services free-of-charge in the streets.</p>
<p> Depending on funds raised, we will send between 4 and 8 highly-trained and experienced <strong>Street Medics</strong>* to the East Coast. In addition to hundreds of dollars individual Rosehips are committing to this Convention season, the group needs to raise a minimum of <strong>$2000 </strong>in travel expenses. Without contributions now, some of us will be forced to reconsider our plans in light of survival needs (like rent), which could mean fewer queer medics in the streets and wellness spaces of Charlotte and Tampa this year.</p>
<p> <em>[In the highly unlikely event that we over-fundraise for our travel needs this Convention season, we will use the funds for any legal needs (eg. bail, citations, replacing damaged/confiscated equipment, court expenses, etc.) that arise for us, or we will contribute to legal funds of other medics and high-risk (People of Color, LGBTQ, undocumented, etc) individuals.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Who we are:</strong></p>
<p>The Rosehip Medic Collective is a group of volunteer, primarily queer-identified Street Medics* and healthcare activists based in Portland, Oregon. We provide first aid and emergency care at protests, direct actions, encampents, and other sites of resistance and struggle. <strong>We have also trained hundreds of other street medics and put on community wellness trainings for activists from houseless, queer, forest defense, student, economic justice, and other communities. </strong>We believe in democratizing healthcare knowledge and skills, in reducing dependence on corporate medicine, and that strong networks of support and care are essential to building sustainable, long-term movements for all liberatory struggles.</p>
<p>As medics, we work to create one facet of the healthy and diverse infrastructure we believe necessary to sustaining social justice movements and building a better world. Our group includes EMTs, Wilderness First Responders, herbalists, community educators and more.

<p><strong>What's a “Street Medic”?*</strong></p>
<p>Street Medics have been a regular feature of grassroots social justice movements since the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964, when doctors, nurses and students marched in solidarity with Civil Rights protestors and offered free Good Samaritan care. While local Emergency Medical Services (EMS) reguarly play a part in government response to large protests, <strong>police regularly withhold ambulance crews where they see an interest in controlling or arresting crowds</strong>. Add to this the expense and sometimes-frightening experience of seeking conventional emergency response, and many people choose to go without cruical first aid and aftercare—or to stay home. Past mass mobilizations in Denver, Pittsburgh and elsewhere have seen collaboration between Street Medics and city EMS. Most recently street medics joined with social justic-inclined healthcare practitioners across North America to support local “Occupy!” activists, campers, and visitors.</p>

<h2><b>Our Story</b></h2>
<span>Youth in the Arts-IMAGINE (YITA-IMAGINE)</span>
 a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Corporation and founded in April 2010 by Sheba Brown is based 
on the belief that attention to our youth needs to be of the utmost 
importance and we are committed to meeting those needs through the 
introduction and development of art education.  With limited resources 
available in schools today for arts programming and curriculum, 
YITA-IMAGINE combines the elements of personal growth and 
self-development, with artistic expression as a way to build 
self-esteem, spirit and self-confidence among youth as well as adults by  demonstrating 
all of the positive qualities viewed in the various arts.  The goal is 
to positively transform youth while providing an excitingly needed 
platform for showcasing and nurturing young talent. Throughout the year 
youth and adults attend YITA-IMAGINE workshops to hone skills and learn new 
artistic disciplines from professionals in their areas of expertise such
 as theater, dance, fashion, music, film and stage production. <br/><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>In the fall of 2010 Youth In the Arts-IMAGINE</b> provided introduction and training in all areas of the arts with it's One Day Boot Camps at the 4-H Conference Center, NCCF and Youth in the Arts-IMAGINE, Inc. and also, provided public workshops for registered
 participants, students and art professionals at BDIGI 
Studios in Wash., DC hosted by iCue Music Group formerly, 855 MUSIC GROUP.</p>

<p>While our current public school system offers fewer choices for our youth to explore their creativity in a regular classroom setting, there is a growing interest in the arts heightened by an explosion of popular media programming with great emphasis on creative endeavors. More significant is the emerging high numbers of passionate arts entrepreneurs supported by advanced, cost effective and efficient technology that allows the individual to express their creativity over various social platforms from Instagram to Youtube.  Yet there is very little harnessing of the creative genius in K-12 primary educational schooling.<br/></p>

<p>Additionally, YITA uses a creative learning model in summer school programming that engages youth in three project-based learning components: developing employable skills, work readiness training and leadership skills building and critical thinking needed to be successful in any workplace.  </p>
<p>Each period of instruction is culminated with a major production allowing all participants to demonstrate their talent on stage to a large audience of family and friends.  Demographically, YITA's emphasis is on serving at-risk youth located in the  Greater Washington Metropolitan Area, however, we also offer our broad programming to striving youth outside of this population and look to expand our territory to locations in various parts of the country.<br/></p>

<h3>What We Have Accomplished</h3>
<p>Already just over 3 years, YITA has served approximately 300 youth and over 50 adults. We've also witnessed the impact YITA has already made on returning youth, who've demonstrated remarkable improvement in their attitudes, freedom of creative expression, etiquette and classroom attentiveness. Their enthusiasm and performance skills have grown from the time they've entered until the time they've exited as witnessed by evaluations and the quality of production of a culminating performance managed and produced by the youth and staff.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $79,000 or more in funds to service 50 or more youth in the After School Programming and return to The National Center for Children and Families (NCCF) community of homeless residents, disadvantaged and abused victims to host a few of our One Day Art Boot Camps (""IMAGINE""). <a href=""http://youtu.be/M_u4XJjj3zw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(view video)</a> </p>
<p>The funding is needed for the following: instruction supplies such as uniform T-shirts for staff and students; art, office and classroom supplies (notebooks, pens, printer ink, paper, pencils, paint, brushes, canvas, fabric, etc.); technical equipment (photo and video cameras, film projectors, sound system rental, walkie talkies, etc.);  instructor training (creative curriculum such as the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) Creative Worldview curriculum in Petaluma, California); written materials (books, printed handouts and promotional materials) program production fees (costuming, food &amp; snacks and stage props, etc.); youth employment (stipends and compensation for certain positions); and venue rental fees for off campus workshops. Our difficulty is not finding students but securing the finances to support our very unique programming. Although we are soliciting grantors for funding, the process is arduously long and without a paid full-time grants writer, we have fallen short of our fiscal goal.<br/></p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will use whatever funds collected in one of the above areas.  If we're fortunate enough to exceed our goal we will be able to use those funds to re-introduce Youth in the Arts Day ""IMAGINE"" our One Day Boot Camp. </p>

Imagination requires one to push the boundaries of the rhetorical left hemisphere of the brain into the right hemisphere where creativity expands beyond the limits of mediocrity and conformity. It allows individual growth through self discovery and mastery essential for peak performace while aiding society as a whole in maintaining order and balance in the world. Nowhere is imagination appreciated more than the arts and entertainment industries.

Our Story
Youth in the Arts-IMAGINE (YITA-IMAGINE)
 a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Corporation and founded in April 2010 by Sheba Brown is based 
on the belief that attention to our youth needs to be of the utmost 
importance and we are committed to meeting those needs through the 
introduction and development of art education.  With limited resources 
available in schools today for arts programming and curriculum, 
YITA-IMAGINE combines the elements of personal growth and 
self-development, with artistic expression as a way to build 
self-esteem, spirit and self-confidence among youth as well as adults by  demonstrating 
all of the positive qualities viewed in the various arts.  The goal is 
to positively transform youth while providing an excitingly needed 
platform for showcasing and nurturing young talent. Throughout the year 
youth and adults attend YITA-IMAGINE workshops to hone skills and learn new 
artistic disciplines from professionals in their areas of expertise such
 as theater, dance, fashion, music, film and stage production. 
In the fall of 2010 Youth In the Arts-IMAGINE provided introduction and training in all areas of the arts with it's One Day Boot Camps at the 4-H Conference Center, NCCF and Youth in the Arts-IMAGINE, Inc. and also, provided public workshops for registered
 participants, students and art professionals at BDIGI 
Studios in Wash., DC hosted by iCue Music Group formerly, 855 MUSIC GROUP.




In 2013 YITA began providing after school educational programming to fill the void public schools are lacking in arts instruction and creative curricula. Originally, a volunteer program, YITA has grown into a functioning 501(c)3 organization that seeks to hire competent instructors and produce creative curricula to engage and inspire youth to reach their highest potential within and outside of the classroom.

While our current public school system offers fewer choices for our youth to explore their creativity in a regular classroom setting, there is a growing interest in the arts heightened by an explosion of popular media programming with great emphasis on creative endeavors. More significant is the emerging high numbers of passionate arts entrepreneurs supported by advanced, cost effective and efficient technology that allows the individual to express their creativity over various social platforms from Instagram to Youtube.  Yet there is very little harnessing of the creative genius in K-12 primary educational schooling.
PERFORMANCE & TEAMWORK


MARTIAL ARTS - HEALING ARTS - DISCIPLINE & FOCUS 

 
   
FUN * GAMES * FITNESS



YITA offers youth ages 5 yrs. old to adults an array of arts and entertainment instruction that teaches the creative and technical aspects of these industries including but not limited to: 
event production * film directing * producing * different forms of media writing

FILM & LANGUAGE

Additionally, YITA uses a creative learning model in summer school programming that engages youth in three project-based learning components: developing employable skills, work readiness training and leadership skills building and critical thinking needed to be successful in any workplace.  
Each period of instruction is culminated with a major production allowing all participants to demonstrate their talent on stage to a large audience of family and friends.  Demographically, YITA's emphasis is on serving at-risk youth located in the  Greater Washington Metropolitan Area, however, we also offer our broad programming to striving youth outside of this population and look to expand our territory to locations in various parts of the country.
EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT
 


What We Have Accomplished
Already just over 3 years, YITA has served approximately 300 youth and over 50 adults. We've also witnessed the impact YITA has already made on returning youth, who've demonstrated remarkable improvement in their attitudes, freedom of creative expression, etiquette and classroom attentiveness. Their enthusiasm and performance skills have grown from the time they've entered until the time they've exited as witnessed by evaluations and the quality of production of a culminating performance managed and produced by the youth and staff.

All of this has been possible due to our talented and dedicated Sr. & Jr. Staff Members who range in ages 14 yrs. old and up.

  
 



  
   



What We Need & What You Get
We are seeking $79,000 or more in funds to service 50 or more youth in the After School Programming and return to The National Center for Children and Families (NCCF) community of homeless residents, disadvantaged and abused victims to host a few of our One Day Art Boot Camps (""IMAGINE""). (view video) 
The funding is needed for the following: instruction supplies such as uniform T-shirts for staff and students; art, office and classroom supplies (notebooks, pens, printer ink, paper, pencils, paint, brushes, canvas, fabric, etc.); technical equipment (photo and video cameras, film projectors, sound system rental, walkie talkies, etc.);  instructor training (creative curriculum such as the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) Creative Worldview curriculum in Petaluma, California); written materials (books, printed handouts and promotional materials) program production fees (costuming, food & snacks and stage props, etc.); youth employment (stipends and compensation for certain positions); and venue rental fees for off campus workshops. Our difficulty is not finding students but securing the finances to support our very unique programming. Although we are soliciting grantors for funding, the process is arduously long and without a paid full-time grants writer, we have fallen short of our fiscal goal.
If we don't reach our goal, we will use whatever funds collected in one of the above areas.  If we're fortunate enough to exceed our goal we will be able to use those funds to re-introduce Youth in the Arts Day ""IMAGINE"" our One Day Boot Camp. 





Other Ways You Can Help
Use your imagination to help us raise funds. Donate funds and post a photo or video of you holding your personal creative sign using one of our group names  ""peace"" ""love"" ""journey"" ""destiny"" and ""spirit,"" or just post a one line statement on our Facebook page. Make sure you let us know your location. Share and ask others to do the same and we'll show the world how using our imagination can create the change we want to see in the world through the arts.
Remember the ""Art of Giving"" can heal, thrill and send love and care to others!

Last
 year for the Australian summer Christmas season, some friends, family 
and I hosted a festive mud themed event for the local community similar to others held in Australia, the USA and Mexico over the last 10yrs (www.mudsunfun.org). A few 
dozen people of all ages from great grandparents to toddlers participated as either audience members, bare foot mud stompers, mud blob passers, mud brick builders, percussionists and food servers. We built sun 
dried earthen mud brick masonry walls on top of a stone foundation and later some of us 
covered ourselves with mud and paraded through town to the local fresh 
water swimming hole. We began building the walls for a small dwelling ""cubby house"" structure. This
 coming summer I plan to return and spend time making sure that people know whatever they need to know to continue this kind of stuff in their community.  We will go through the hows and whys of engaging the community through festive summer building event/s and will we transform the labor intensive 
ï¿½workï¿½ into fun, desirable ï¿½playï¿½.  An instructional video (DVD) will be made for others to replicate our successes. Creative forms of self expression will be added to the mix to help blur the lines between work and play.
The Impact   Trainees will learn new skills, set new precedents and be 
instilled with pride. They will be trained to use art and performances to bring together the 
community. They will also be taught skills that will be applied to help build a unique structure and to create a blueprint that will be made available to everyone. Students will learn how to organize and host a community event, how to build a functional dwelling structure with local ingredients, and how to document what they have learned. The festive events are designed to create an interactive community experience like no other and the 
completed structures are highly worthy of merit. In addition to their 
structural integrity and artistic appeal they are made from low cost, 
locally excavated and harvested materials that do not require burning 
fossil fuels and thereby surpass the most sustainable best practices. The completed structure will add to the legacy of the natural building traditions from around 
the world which are being revived for their many benefits, and bring to

test of time. These include the Taos Pueblos of New Mexico, the cities 
of Djenne and Timbuktu in Mali, Shibam of Yemen, Devon England and the 
Fujian Tulou of China..


Funds will be used to transfer knowledge and 
skills to the community through training local youth and ensuring their educational work experience 
is of the highest quality possible.This is how the money will be spent. It will be used to:-Pay myself a trainers fee (TBD)-Pay a stipend for 3 youth leaders to complete training (TBD)-Hire the following local professionals:        1. Drummer - to create rhythm for the event and rehearse the performance (TBD)
        2. Choreographer- to create a dance performance to blur the lines between work and play (TBD)

With a reach of over 25,000 people across 45 villages we operate in both the North and South of Sri Lanka, aiming to lift up the poverty stricken villagers from a post-tsunami and post-war environment through a holistic model which focuses on building up the community through 30 different sectors.</p>
<p>Since the year 2000 the FoG has delivered over 14,000 essential school supplies packs to impoverished school children who could not afford to purchase their supply lists for a new school year. Many of the children in these rural villages go to school ill equipped to make the most of the education they receive, or drop out of school because they do not have all the items they need for their studies. Providing them with everything from shoes and a water bottle to the books and bag they need, we try to ensure that their education will not be interrupted due to a lack of essential school items.</p>
<p>This year we hope to deliver Essential School Supplies Packs to over 1500 students who, without our help, would be unable to complete their education to the best of their ability. Join us today, and help break the cycle of poverty these children are enmeshed in by helping make their dreams come true, and their good fortune will then help them drag a whole family out of the clutches of poverty. Everyone should have a chance to dream of a better future. Help change the fate of 1500 lives… it may just change <em>your </em>life!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What we use the money for:</strong></h2>
<p>USD 30 will help us assemble one pack of essential school supplies and deliver it to the school of the child beneficiary. Two types of packs will be assembled with regard to age specific requirements, please find below a complete list of items included in each pack:</p>

Short Summary
I am a beauty and lifestyle writer, and I'm donating my hair to make a wig for a woman with cancer who cannot afford one while undergoing treatment.
When I learned it takes nine donations to make just one wig, and realized I'd personally thrown away four of them in my lifetime, I knew I needed to make a bigger change than merely getting my hair cut. I enlisted the help of colleagues in the celebrity beauty business, and set a goal to spread awareness about the particulars of hair donation.
I set a goal to collect 1,000 ponytails and made plans to go on a summer hair ""drive"" to do it. I'll be kicking off the first-annual TLC tour in Fisco, Texas on November 9, 2013, and we'll be making stops across North America through 2014.
We'll present the proceeds of our drive to Beautiful Lengths at our Growing Hope Gala and Fashion Show.

<p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Today, <i>there are many children that
do not have the luxury of growing up with a happy and carefree childhood.</i>
Instead, they are forced into premature adulthood as a result of extreme
poverty, social and political instability, malnutrition, violence, racism, and
the loss of loved ones–often times being one or more of their parents. This is
the harsh reality for children living all over the world and this is especially
true for the children living in South
Africa.  </p>
<p>UNICEF defines an orphan as “a child
under the age of 18 years whose mother, father, or both biological parents have
died.” There are roughly <b>3.85 million orphans living in South Africa today.</b>
Without parents to help guide and nurture these children, many are left
homeless, hopeless, and hungry. They often quit attending school and end up
getting into trouble. For children living in the most under-served regions of
the world, education is the only tool they have to break the vicious cycle of
poverty. Discontinuation of school can have devastating effects on the rest of
their lives. </p>
<p>In the words of the great leader,
Nelson Mandela: “<b>Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to
change the world.</b>” The team at Swings for Dreams could not agree with this
statement more, but the issue in a lot of these areas is not the lack of
schools. The issue is more about student retention—<i>getting kids to keep
attending school once they have started. </i>For kids given the opportunity to
have an education, finishing their studies should be a top priority, but often
times it is not. Understandably, students who have lost parents or are left to
take care of themselves and their families, quickly lose their motivation to
attend class. But, our team has found a simple solution to get kids motivated
to keep attending school: <b>play.</b></p>
<p>Kids are more inclined to want to go
to school if there is an <b>incentive</b>—and we believe outdoor play keeps
kids motivated. Not only does play serve as a positive reinforcement to keep
children in school so that they can eventually break free from poverty, but it
has countless other <b>physical and developmental benefits.</b> Kids who play
outside are <b>happier, healthier, and stronger</b>. They are <b>leaner, have
stronger immune systems, get more Vitamin D, have lower stress levels, and have
more active imaginations. </b>American Clinical Psychologist, Kay Redfield
Jamison, writes that “<b>Children need the freedom and time to play. Play is
not a luxury. Play is a necessity</b>.” The fact that safe, free, outdoor play
is not available to all children worldwide is a crime against humanity. Kids
need the freedom to be kids, and play can do just that.</p>

childhood development. Not only will these funds be bringing a playground
to Nieu-Bethesda, but this money will also create hope in this South
African community--hope for the future and for a better tomorrow. UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who has donated to our campaign thus far. We are forever grateful for your generosity & support. You are truly making a difference in the lives of the children in Nieu-Bethesda. Our team wanted to send a quick update to anyone that has donated or is thinking about donating...Even if we do not make our $30,000 goal, we are going to South Africa to build a playground. Ultimately, we will update our initial design to one that is more feasible financially. So, continue to spread the word and donate. We'll be heading to South Africa in August, rain or shine!What We Need & What You Get

In order to fully fund all of the
construction materials for our project this summer, we need to raise $30,000. Each and every donation will go toward making the dreams
of our team members and the children living in Nieu-Bethesda a
reality. Every cent counts! Please help us bring hope to this community so
that kids can be kids, despite the hardships they face. 
Not to worry-- If we don’t
reach our entire goal, all of the funds donated to our campaign will still be
going toward funding the playground this summer.  We are strong
believers in the power of play and are determined to make this playground a
reality. Please help us help the kids! 
If our mission speaks to you and
you’d like to play a critical part to bring a play structure to the kids of
Nieu-Bethesda, Swings for Dreams would love to give you a little something in
return to show our appreciation. Check out our perks for more detail. 

The Impact
Today, there are many children that
do not have the luxury of growing up with a happy and carefree childhood.
Instead, they are forced into premature adulthood as a result of extreme
poverty, social and political instability, malnutrition, violence, racism, and
the loss of loved ones–often times being one or more of their parents. This is
the harsh reality for children living all over the world and this is especially
true for the children living in South
Africa.  
UNICEF defines an orphan as “a child
under the age of 18 years whose mother, father, or both biological parents have
died.” There are roughly 3.85 million orphans living in South Africa today.
Without parents to help guide and nurture these children, many are left
homeless, hopeless, and hungry. They often quit attending school and end up
getting into trouble. For children living in the most under-served regions of
the world, education is the only tool they have to break the vicious cycle of
poverty. Discontinuation of school can have devastating effects on the rest of
their lives. 
In the words of the great leader,
Nelson Mandela: “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to
change the world.” The team at Swings for Dreams could not agree with this
statement more, but the issue in a lot of these areas is not the lack of
schools. The issue is more about student retention—getting kids to keep
attending school once they have started. For kids given the opportunity to
have an education, finishing their studies should be a top priority, but often
times it is not. Understandably, students who have lost parents or are left to
take care of themselves and their families, quickly lose their motivation to
attend class. But, our team has found a simple solution to get kids motivated
to keep attending school: play.
Kids are more inclined to want to go
to school if there is an incentive—and we believe outdoor play keeps
kids motivated. Not only does play serve as a positive reinforcement to keep
children in school so that they can eventually break free from poverty, but it
has countless other physical and developmental benefits. Kids who play
outside are happier, healthier, and stronger. They are leaner, have
stronger immune systems, get more Vitamin D, have lower stress levels, and have
more active imaginations. American Clinical Psychologist, Kay Redfield
Jamison, writes that “Children need the freedom and time to play. Play is
not a luxury. Play is a necessity.” The fact that safe, free, outdoor play
is not available to all children worldwide is a crime against humanity. Kids
need the freedom to be kids, and play can do just that.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Edmonton Poetry Festival Verse Project
is dedicated to working with students and teachers to help establish a lifelong
interest in poetry and the literary arts. Our program helps students learn to
love words and increases literacy. We send poets into to classrooms to present poetry workshops and to help youth explore their own unique voice
and how it can be used in poetry. You can read more about the program at <a href=""http://edmontonpoetryfestival.com/poets-in-the-schools/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://edmontonpoetryfestival.com/poets-in-the-schools/</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $5000.00 to support this program for one year. This allows us to pay our poets and to administer the program. This funding will enable to us to go into 40 schools this school year, allowing us to reach approximately 1200 students. Every contributor will be recognized on through our website and social media. Tax receipts are available for contributors. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The program, was established in 2006 and until
now was available only during the poetry festival week. Each festival week we
host roughly 15 poetry workshops, bringing poetry to nearly 500 students per
year. That’s approximately 3500 students who have been engaged in poetry since
we began. </p>
<p>It is time to expand and offer this program to those students who
have been unable to access it during festival week. Teachers have asked us to
provide workshops at other times of the year to fit with their curriculum
needs. </p>
<p></p>
<p>By bringing poetry
into classrooms, students meet face to face with writers who can convey the
pleasures of creating and sharing poems. Teachers learn tips and techniques
they can use with their classes in the future. We build connections. We build
bridges in literary communities that we hope will continue long after the poet
leaves the building. </p>
<b>Words From a Student</b><p><b></b></p>
<p>“Being a young writer comes with a lot of
uncertainty and excessive experimenting. By being given the opportunity to meet
writers from an assortment of different subject areas and genres, a youth who
is either dabbling or neck-high in words is then able to really solidify the
art-form to themselves. At least, that's what it was like for me. By being
exposed to all the different types of poetry and general mediums of writing, my
world was blown. Specifically meeting and getting to work with poets who are
published and are in their adulthood, but still writing, just gave me an extra
confidence boost in my own potential. It is one thing reading about poets and
their general careers and lives, but it's another thing meeting one and
actually getting to work with one. I am overjoyed that I was given this

My father and mother were working in some factories. the relations between my father and mother were not husband and wife. My dad was the husband of my mom's sister, but my father and mother used to work in the same garment factory and at that time my mother wasn't married but she had contact with my father and became pregnant. Our society didn't accept that condition, i.e. having child before the marriage at the age of 15. My mom had some mental problem and also could not speak. She left me due to the fear of society and she immediately married another man. At that time I was alone and no one took care of me. At last my grandmother knew these things and she took me and raised me up from childhood and sent me to school and took care of me and paid me many facilities and she gave me love and affection and enjoyment during that time. I stayed there until class 4 and after that she sent me to the hostel. I was 11 years old. And from that time my life has continued in hostel.

Nepalese people have to bear many problems and I want to be educated and eradicate the evils or the problems which directly or indirectly harm the country. I want to achieve my personal future goals and make a better life. When people are busy in household works they cannot concentrate on their studies. I will graduate my higher study properly and make my future bright and I think I want to develop the nations like Nepal.Q: What do you want to study in college and why?A: I want to study commerce because it helps to run my life properly and it helps to make future bright. As we know it is an interesting subject because it teaches about trade. Trade is the act of buying and selling the goods from one country to another. There is no trade balance in Nepal. If Nepal exports the raw materials 
to other nations we can earn foreign currency, which 
helps to maintain our life. Most of the people sell the raw 
materials expensively. I will decrease its price and by studying 
commerce I will help solve these problems and make trade balance.I want to do something for my nations. I will make 
a good relationship between my neighboring countries and other countries. 
And I will also build mutual understanding among the people from one 
place to another and stop the corruption by making people aware of how 
our country is backwards in all these systems. It helps make the relationship among countries and helps maintain the financial work by conducting different types of programs and it helps to make the strong policy. I will make the border line strong among the natives and also give more facilities to other people and also give them more salaries. Commerce will help me to perform the different works related to any field. It makes the national income strong . It will sustain my life and support my future continuously. Q: What are your biggest educational and career goals?A: I will pass my degree in commerce and after that if my sponsors support me then I will study. My aim is to become the accountant which helps me to gain the knowledge and provide me a lot of information and through this I will obtain many experiences and skills. I have also decided to take the many methods through these systems and I would become the honest accountant who is liked by everyone. In Nepal, many accountants are not honest and they take money. I will run my life in a better way and make different ideas and methods to show others they can be good. My aim will help me to raise my status and raise my family status in all types of activities because now I am low caste. I will make plans and policies so the government may be aware there are problems. and eradicate the social problems which are seen in this country. I want to make economic policies. This education will help me to start positive habits and start on a good path. And from that I will develop my life.Q: How will this scholarship help you?A: It will support my future and make me able to face any kind of problem that
 occurs. It will give me more facilities and a lot of pleasure. it will 
help to make my studies better and my life will move forward. It may 
also help me get the chance to study in the higher college and from it I can learn many things and then support my own life properly. There will be less difficulty in my life this way. And my parents may be happy to listen and they will look at me and it will develop my skills towards the study and I can get a lot of facilities and there will be no obstacles in my life and I can easily run my life with the help of others. I can support my family and my nation which has already helped me. It will make me happy and lead me to do any kind of work I want. I can show my brothers and sisters they can also study in higher education. Other Ways You Can Help

<p><u>Problem Assessment:</u></p>
<p>The fighting currently tearing South
Sudan apart is at its core a power struggle between elite factions of our
society. This struggle has spun into a full-fledged ethnic conflict, in part,
due to the limited capacity and weak processes within the government, and a
lack of restraining factors across South Sudanese society. Weak governance and
a lack of established process for the effective functioning of the state leaves
too much room for corruption and placing the goals of the individual over the
good of the people. As South Sudan begins the long road to recovery and the
building of a stable, effective and representative government, it will be
critical that a conflict prevention lens of analysis has a central role in
shaping that planning process. In particular, if a new transitional government
is agreed upon to end the current crisis, the successful transition to
longer-term institutions will depend on the ability to apply conflict sensitive
approaches to those arrangements. Avoiding a relapse of conflict and protecting
all of South Sudan’s populations is critical to creating the stability
necessary to establishing a “new normal” in the country without war and without
the killing of civilians.</p>
<p>Problem address: (strategic
what/strategic who)</p>
<p>South Sudan faces multiple challenges in
the aftermath of over 20 years of conflict, including: weak governance, limited
education, limited infrastructure and lack of cohesive national identity. These
challenges will take at least a generation to overcome; however, the
foundations of that recovery must be laid today. To achieve that goal, the
Center for the Prevention of Ethnic Conflict (CPEC) proposes to work in three
key areas:</p>
<p><span>1.)<span> 
</span></span>Research:
There exists a robust body of research that continues to grow examining the
best methods for preventing ethnic conflict and mass atrocities. The Center
will serve the dual role of applying that body of knowledge to the situation in
South Sudan and making that research policy relevant, and conducting original
research on the divisions and avenues for reconciliation within the currently
fractured country. In this capacity, CPEC will serve as a pivotal bridge that
will apply the best research on the challenges facing South Sudan and translate
those ideas into actionable policy. </p>
<p><span>2.)<span> 
</span></span>Advocacy:
a critical component to advancing any proposal on the future of South Sudan
will require a broad-based constituency supporting change. Accordingly, CPEC
will work to incubate an advocacy community focusing on the issue of conflict
and atrocity prevention. As this community grows, it will have ability to
advance the prevention agenda with other civil society actors as well as the
government and international organizations. </p>
<p><span>3.)<span> 
</span></span>Training:
Building the capacity of organizations doing related work in this field is an
important step in building capacity within South Sudan. CPEC will initially
undertake training geared toward key practitioners and opinion-makers to facilitate
understanding of risk factors, warning signs, and triggering and escalating
factors, and connecting those factors to tools for preventative action.
Incorporating these frameworks into the activities and analysis of South Sudan’s civil society leaders and policy
professions will help enable this community to continue maturing as a capable
force for action in our society. </p><br/><p></p></div>","As the current crisis in South Sudan

<p>As most of you know, I have loved to
perform ever since I was a young child. All the years of dedication, classes,
theatre troupes and singing have finally paid off... in an amazing opportunity
to attend <a href=""http://www.amda.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AMDA</a>. The training will be intensive and extensive. All the
instructors and professors are working professionals and I will be immersed in
the arts! However, the tuition is high, and although I've been awarded a
scholarship of $4,000 per year, there are many more dollars I must raise.  We have some wonderful incentives for your donations, and remember, any amount helps.  Thank you so much, in advance.  : )</p>
<p>Here's a bit about me... <b>I did not choose the path of an
artist, the path chose me. It was something I was born with, something that
defined me at a young age. My mom (Gypsy) discovered this about me when I was
only nineteen months old. At the time, my absolute favorite movie was Bambi and
my mom had a VHS that she had running, practically continuously, in my bedroom.
As the story goes... when I was in my parent's room playing with my toys, Bambi
could be heard on the baby monitor in their room. Bambi happens to have almost
no dialogue, but instead the story is told through its images and a musical
score to communicate what is happening in the scenes throughout the movie. I
was told that while sitting there, I began to recite the actions of the scene
by just hearing the soundtrack through the baby monitor. Both my parents
couldn't believe their eyes as they rushed into my bedroom, ecstatic to find
that my explanations were spot on. They were amazed that I could identify the corresponding
actions happening in the movie by hearing the soundtrack. Mom told me that at
that moment, she knew I had the gene - the calling for art. It started with my
love for music at such a young age and blossomed through the years to come with
my discovery of the theatre. </b></p>
<p><b>When I was five years old, my love of acting and the theatre began. I got
the opportunity to perform in my first musical, ""Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolour Dreamcoat,"" at Crossroads summer camp. We worked six hours a
day for six weeks to prepare for the production. Every summer thereafter for
the next five years, there was a new play, new auditions and a new character
through which I had the opportunity to express myself. I also participated in
musical productions with Miss Amanda's <i>Stage Kids</i> theatre troupe
throughout the school years after that first experience at summer camp
prompting my love of performing in the theatre. One of my most cherished
moments was being honored with the role of Elphaba in ""Wicked."" I
cannot truly express the way it feels to perform. Putting it into words just
doesn’t quite capture the extent to which I feel connected to life and joy when
I am performing. Art is everything to me: it is the way I cope, the way I
learn, the way I express my feelings and myself. Without art, the world
wouldn't be the same place and I wouldn't be the same person.    
   </b></p>
<p>Your contributions
will go directly to tuition and housing.  The schedule is rigorous and
requires that I be in classes from 8:00am until 5:00pm, with rehearsals in the
evenings so living on campus is necessary.  Contributors will receive my
immense gratitude and promise of dedication and hard work.  This is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me, and a dream come true!  Also, I will always strive to use my success for positive changes and contributions in the world.  I give you my word.</p>

When I was five years old, my love of acting and the theatre began. I got
the opportunity to perform in my first musical, ""Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolour Dreamcoat,"" at Crossroads summer camp. We worked six hours a
day for six weeks to prepare for the production. Every summer thereafter for
the next five years, there was a new play, new auditions and a new character
through which I had the opportunity to express myself. I also participated in
musical productions with Miss Amanda's Stage Kids theatre troupe
throughout the school years after that first experience at summer camp
prompting my love of performing in the theatre. One of my most cherished
moments was being honored with the role of Elphaba in ""Wicked."" I
cannot truly express the way it feels to perform. Putting it into words just
doesn’t quite capture the extent to which I feel connected to life and joy when
I am performing. Art is everything to me: it is the way I cope, the way I
learn, the way I express my feelings and myself. Without art, the world
wouldn't be the same place and I wouldn't be the same person.    
   
Your contributions
will go directly to tuition and housing.  The schedule is rigorous and
requires that I be in classes from 8:00am until 5:00pm, with rehearsals in the
evenings so living on campus is necessary.  Contributors will receive my
immense gratitude and promise of dedication and hard work.  This is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me, and a dream come true!  Also, I will always strive to use my success for positive changes and contributions in the world.  I give you my word.

<p>The Shockoe Sessions Recording Camp is a two week intensive workshop for High School Juniors, Seniors and College Freshman in music production.  The camp is held at In Your Ear recording studios located in Downtown Richmond, VA.  The purpose is to bring creative, musically driven students into the real world of modern music production from both aesthetic and technical perspectives. The camp promotes interaction between recording artists, producers, engineers and representatives from top pro-audio manufacturers.  For the past two years, The Shockoe Sessions have hosted top bands and top students from central Virginia resulting in tremendous experiences for everyone involved.  So what happens if you have the talent and desire but lack the financial resources to attend? How can we offer this experience to those who can’t afford the tuition?  The answer is sponsorship.  For just $500, we can admit a deserving student to the July sessions.  The discounted $500 tuition covers all expenses for the two weeks, six hours daily, Monday through Friday and includes a healthy lunch.  Students will experience music production from the inside by working with professional engineers and producers.  They’ll learn how hard working professional artists bring what they do to the outside world. They’ll study the proper use of microphones, analog processing gear, popular audio software and learn how these are used in professional recording.  They’ll also meet and connect with others who share their love of music and the craft of music production.  Students will be selected based on enthusiasm, talent and financial need. The Greater Richmond YMCA, the CHAT program, and JAMinc, all top charitable organizations who work with Richmond’s youth population, will identify the best candidates.  Why should you help? </p>

for an illness. My brother had no children and never been married. He was my best friend.  Doug and I were only dating

has continued to support me and my family till this day.</p>
<p><span>  After that I knew he
was the one and we got married in 2012. It was the best decision we ever made. Just
before our wedding, I experienced my pain in my side that would come and go. We
didn’t have insurance at the time. It was discovered that I have uterine fibroids
and a lot of them. In 2013, my period stopped and the doctor told me that my
hormone levels were low and to see a specialist. That specialist couldn’t help
me and sent me to the Fertility Center. After more tests were done, if you know
me then you know I don’t like needles, we found out that both of my Fallopian
tubes were blocked. Due to the blockage the egg and sperm can’t meet. We also
was told that I had a low Ovarian Reserve count. All women are born with a
certain amount of  eggs. In order for us to have a chance to have a baby we would have
to do in vitro
 fertilization. IVF involves combining eggs and sperm outside the
body in a laboratory. Once an embryo or embryos form, they are then placed in
the uterus. Also we have to have </span>Intracytoplasmic Sperm

</h3><p></p>I'm an Indian girl who has grown up in a family that encouraged its children to learn and appreciate music and dance. As a child, I was introduced to classical ballet and western piano. Since then, I have completed close to 15 years of practice and tutoring of both ballet and piano.<br/><br/>Though I love playing the piano, it is ballet that gave me more opportunities. I was a keen student. We got ample opportunities in our ballet school to showcase our choreography skills, even when we quite young. At the age of 15, I was invited by my ballet instructor to join her as an additional teacher for the growing number of students our school had begun to admit. Since then, I have taught over 60 students ranging from ages 4 years to 50 years. I had also been invited to teach at several other places, and I chose to teach at my music school. <br/><br/>It was this experience and the joy I associated with managing to educate as well as be loved by each of my students that made me determined to pursue a career within dance education. I had begun to build a dream that involved creating a unique and extensively planned institute for performing arts in India that would spread the love I had formed for dance education, with collaborations from other renowned and upcoming exponents of performing arts.<br/><br/>I did my undergraduate studies in Economics from one of the best colleges in India. Ballet took a back seat during those years, for I could not simultaneously spend enough quality time on both academics and dancing. I had planned to restart my ballet practice right after complete my B.A. focus on getting college education in the same. It is around this time that I suffered an injury which affected my spine, and delayed my return to practice.<br/><br/>I applied for a place in Trinity Laban Conservatoire in London, UK, because Indian institutions provide college level education in Indian performing arts only. This is one reason why I feel that there is a great need for institutes like the one I have planned to start so that students do not have to travel abroad for getting a good education in disciplines like ballet.<br/><br/>For this to be realized, however, I still need my academic base to be built by getting educated at a top college in the world, myself.

I chose the programme because I identify with it completely. I convinced the admissions committee with my experience of being injured as a dancer and teacher, and how I want to educate other dancers by focusing on the physiology and psychology of the dancer.<br/><br/>The next step, now, is to finance this goal. My family is unable to bear the burden. Even servicing a loan is near impossible. I had secured this admission last year, and had to defer it by one year because my family was unable to afford the expenses.

<h3><strong>How I started</strong></h3>
<p>Let me begin by saying that I have never given up and do not intend to now. My life has been full of a tremendous number of challenges but bit by bit I have found a way to overcome each of them as I set my sights on it. I am just a few classes from my Bachelors of Science degree in Art, Digital Media with a Minor in Art History-- and I need financial help to overcome a current hurdle and finish this.</p>
<p><strong>1969 </strong>I started out in a remote cabin five miles outside of 29 Palms, California. My parents were poor and uneducated but they managed. When I was 18 months old I contracted meningitis. It destroyed the left temporal region of my brain, put me into a coma and paralyzed the entire right side of my body. I remained at Los Angeles' Children's Hospital until I was 3 years old. When I left I still had nearly constant grand mal seizures but had recovered much of my mobility. The state wanted my parents to sign me over to institutionalized care but they refused. By the time I was five the seizures had pretty much disappeared. Even so, the doctors at the time felt that I would never be capable of attending school nor living a normalized life. My parents refused to believe that and fought to allow me to attend public school in regular classes.</p>
<p><strong>1974 </strong>School was not easy for me and a disruptive home life did not help, so by the time I was in fourth grade I still could neither read a book nor a clock. Many of the teachers just passed me without trying to teach me because it was easier than the alternative.</p>
<p><strong>1979 </strong>That is, until I entered fifth grade and was blessed to have Charles Gimby as my teacher. He refused to accept that I was a lost cause. Within those nine months I went from illiterate to the top of my class and received the school-wide award for the most improved student. That year I also began volunteering for the Morongo Eagles Special Olympics program. I helped to encourage the competitors to achieve their best and saw that I had a lot of experience to offer. That began my lifelong commitment to volunteering in my communities. From fifth grade on I did very well in school with the exception of algebra. The damage to my brain as an infant made it impossible for me to be able to retain abstract math.</p>
<p><strong>1980 </strong>This year my siblings and I went into private school. It was a small school but the curriculum allowed you to work as fast or as slow as you wanted. I blazed through course after course and loved it! That year I also completed my first marathon, raising more money myself than all of the other runners combined. I made fund-raising a regular part of my volunteerism.</p>
<p><strong>1985 </strong>Every Winter and Summer break I visited my dad in Arizona. He was now living near Sedona, Arizona. I began volunteering throughout these breaks at Kachina Pointe Retirement hospital. Helping the elderly find joy toward the end of life gave me tremendous satisfaction and gave me many wonderful memories with some truly amazing people.</p>
<p><strong>1987 </strong>My guidance counselor in high school said that there was no way I would ever be able to attend college because of my algebra disability and did not try to give me paths to achieve it. Neither of my parents had attended college and my step-father was not able to direct me. Even though I was, at that time, the town queen and was soon to spend a year in Indonesia as an exchange student, people still saw me as not worthy of a college degree.</p>
<p><strong>1988 </strong>When I returned from Indonesia my home life was in shambles. We moved to a town just outside of Palm Springs. I was working in a children's store near Palm Springs for about eight months but learned of a high-paying opening with the US Department of Agriculture for the summer. I took the summer position as a USDA Ag Inspector which afforded me the funds to attend one semester of college. My step-Great-Grandfather died suddenly  that Fall followed by my Step-Father a few days after Christmas. My mother was unable to cope with the loss and went to stay at a recovery facility in Palm Springs.</p>
<p><strong>1989 </strong>I<strong> </strong>began seven classes at Copper Mountain Community College that January while my mother was being treated. I split care of my little sister with my step-grandparents. When my mother returned a few months later I let her know that I was intending to move out so that I could focus on college. Apparently she wasn't in a healthy mental state yet and her response to my intention of leaving left me with no alternative but to flee to my grandparents home that night. In order to save me they helped me to move abruptly to Portland, Oregon. It meant that I wouldn't be able to take finals that semester, so my classes that were otherwise straight A's were negatively affected.</p>
<p><strong>1990 </strong>I enrolled in Portland Community College a few months later when I had gotten somewhat settled in Portland. There I met the fellow student that would keep me from completely losing all ground and who would be there through everything that happened next.</p>
<p><strong>1991 </strong>Toward the end of January I came down very sick. Within a week I was having difficulty walking. Seizures started again after being gone for nearly 15 years. I had to withdraw from school while the doctors tried to determine what was wrong. The fellow student and I moved in together so that he could help take care of me. My arms were very weak, I was endlessly fatigued and needed two canes to walk any distance at all. The doctors suspected Multiple Sclerosis and began treating me for that. I was 21. It would be a year before I would rebound and be back to normal. </p>
<p>As soon as I could walk reasonably well again I sought out work so that I could get back on my feet. I went through Vocational Rehabilitation and was placed as a Market Researcher. (I rapidly grew in that company and was in charge of focus groups and international research when I left five years later.)</p>
<p><strong>1992 </strong>The student that had been there through all of difficulties now became my husband and a year later we had our first child. Over the next ten years I climbed the corporate ladder despite numerous repeated attacks on my body by what they thought was MS, including a six month period of quadriplegia while pregnant with my second child.</p>
<p><strong>2001 </strong>When I reached 31 I was an Account Manager for a large telecommunications company and personally managed twenty Fortune 200 clients. I wanted to go further with the company but needed to have my degree in order to do so. I had saved a lot of stock and we decided to move to Ashland, Oregon to attend Southern Oregon University and get our degrees. (My husband had to drop out of school all those years before to help take care of me). We moved down here in August of 2001. In September, 9/11 happened, and the stock market crashed. My telecommunications company didn't recover so the stocks that had been worth well over $130 each were now worth .13 cents each. </p>
<p>I was working as a buyer at a local gift and household goods store, Paddington Station and my husband was working as a line cook at a The Wild Goose Cafe, so we figured we would manage. And we did. We did very well in college and it looked like our lives were finally pointing in the right direction for the next two years.</p>
<p><strong>2003 </strong>But in February 2003 I was struck by another severe attack, the very worst yet. This time it also caused my liver to start to fail, affected my heart and the quadriplegia would last well over one year. The doctors now changed the diagnosis from MS to a rare form of Muscular Dystrophy called Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis probable Andersen-Tawil variant. My husband continued to go to school, work and raise the children while I was trapped in my body and unable to help. </p>
<p><strong>2005 </strong>I did finally recover and we began to get our lives back in order once again when I had a stroke. It greatly affected my language center which, I would later learn, effectively wiped out the languages I had previously known, such as Indonesian, Malaysian, French, and German. For the next year I sounded somewhat drunk but my mind was seemingly normal aside from the foreign languages. In college I was intending to get my Bachelors of Arts degree but when I tried to take French class. Not only was the French no longer there in my brain, I could barely retain any new French language. Foreign language is a requirement for a Bachelor's of Art degree. Instead of giving up I changed my degree to a Bachelors of Science and began taking all of the needed science courses to apply to that degree change.</p>
<p><strong>2008 </strong>School went well until early March 2008 when I had another attack of quadriplegia, this time just from my torso down. I was able to continue with school after taking a few weeks off to adjust to navigating campus in an electric wheelchair and training my dog to carry my books and sit quietly for long stretches in a classroom setting. I continued straight on until nearly my last classes. I only needed one quantitative and one qualitative course to graduate but if I added two Art History classes I would also get my minor in Art History. </p>
<p><strong>2009 </strong>That Summer I was anticipating being finished with my undergraduate degree very soon. Through it all I had maintained a high GPA and felt like the hard part was behind me. I was very close with my father and he was quite vocal with anyone who would listen about how proud he was of me. I spoke with him regularly but I had noticed he was beginning to be behaving strangely and his posts on Facebook were increasingly strange. Around the same age my father now was, his father had committed suicide. So I asked him, point blank, if he was intending to kill himself. He swore up and down that he wasn't. He unfriended me on Facebook that week but a few weeks later he re-friended me. He again swore that he wasn't planning on ending his life yet on September 9th he did just that with a bullet to his head. He apparently believed that 09/09/09 was an auspicious date and that he would be reunited with a long lost love that day in heaven.</p>
<p>I withdrew from school that Fall to go to Arizona and take care of his things and his funeral (there wasn't anyone else in his life to do it) and planned on returning in Winter to school. Unfortunately that December I had another severe attack, much worse than most of the ones before. No treatment was helping and it looked like there wasn't going to be any way to overcome it this time around. I also developed a melanoma on my leg that took two surgeries to fully remove and a year later they would tell me that I had uterine cancer, the same cancer my mother was dying from. Fortunately, the uterine cancer was a misdiagnosis. </p>
<p><strong>2011 </strong>By Fall I was chronically ill and figured that I had a year or so left in me. In December I had developed a serious sinus infection and went to the clinic to get antibiotics. The usual doctors weren't there so a specialist who volunteered at the clinic once a month saw me instead. As he was looking over my chart he remarked that I was one of the luckiest people in the world. When I asked him why on earth he would even think that, he said that he was pretty sure I had been misdiagnosed all this time and, if so, that my life was about to change tremendously. The disorder he was suspecting happened to be his specialty, a specialty that a very small number of doctors in the whole country would have recognized.</p>
<p><strong>2012 January </strong>A round of tests were run and it was verified that I did not have MS or Muscular Dystrophy but had actually been born with a genetic inability to absorb B-vitamins called Homocystenuria and it is fully treatable. These days every baby that is born in the US is tested for it at birth when they draw blood from the heel prick. They are testing for homocystenuria as well as phenylketonuria. After decades of wrong turns and false hopes I didn't believe a word of it. He then showed me the vitamin levels in my tests. Every single one was severely deficient--not just all of the B-Vitamins but all of them--calcium, magnesium, zinc, vitamin D, etc. We began treatment.</p>
<p><strong>March </strong>By March I felt like I was a teenager again! It was BEAUTIFUL!! And hard to believe that it would be like that forever but I immediately took advantage of it and began to take steps toward getting my life back.</p>
<p>At that same time we were living in student housing while my husband was finishing his Masters in Management degree. We found out that the University needed to tear down our house and move us into a different one. We moved while I looked for a job. I still was challenged by bone and joint problems stemming from the dengue fever I contracted in Indonesia and the decades of damage done by having vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Although they do cause pain, the overall quality of my life is extraordinarily better than it has been since I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>May </strong>I found a position at an amazing local non-profit called the Hospice Unique Boutique. It is a high quality resale boutique that supports end-of-life care programs and last wishes in the Rogue Valley. In their first year they were able to gift $5000 to those programs, in their second year they gifted $10,000. This year they gifted $30,000!!! I accepted the position as the Assistant Manager. It is the most wonderful shop to experience and the most rewarding place I have ever had the pleasure to support. If you are from this area you have to check it out (<a href=""http://www.hospiceuniqueboutique.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.hospiceuniqueboutique.org</a>), or friend them on Facebook and you will see what I mean.</p>
<p>Around the time that we moved is when I contacted the Department of Education and Direct Loans to get back to school. They told me that they would put my loans into forbearance, because we were too poor to pay any loans at the time, and then when I returned to school again in Fall it would automatically roll over into deferment while I was a student. </p>
<p><strong>June </strong>During the next few months my eldest daughter graduated from high school, my youngest daughter graduated from middle school, we became short-term foster parents for another girl and we moved my eldest daughter to Portland to attend Portland State University as a double major in Physics and Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>October </strong>I returned to school and felt overjoyed! Being is school is tremendously rewarding for me and all of the possibilities of having my degree are very close at hand. I love to learn, I love the academic environment and I love the daily challenges. I am grateful to be there every single day.</p>
<p><strong>November</strong> I am now going into finals with one Max/MSP/Jitter Programming class, and two 400 level Art History classes. But this week, November 26th, 2012, I found out that my student loans had not actually been sent to forbearance but instead were in default because they say they sent me paperwork in March that I didn't return to them. I don't doubt that they sent the paperwork but I have not seen it. This would have been during the time we were moving, so it likely got lost in the shuffle. All this time that I thought that my loans were in forbearance and rolling into deferment they weren't and now it is too late to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>December </strong>In order to correct it<strong> </strong>I have made arrangement to make 10 months of payments which will get the loans out of the default status. But right now I have to pay for this term, which is $2327.29 and the upcoming next term which will be around the same. If I can't do that by December 28th then I am likely to lose my student house and have to move, which I don't have the funds for either. And I won't be able to finish my degree nor go in to the Master's program where they have already told me they would love to have me.</p>
<p>My husband has recently started his own business after months of unsuccessful job hunting. He does web design and marketing for restaurants and has recently obtained his first client but because he has just started this business he has only made a small amount of money and my work only earns enough to cover our basic costs. There is no way that we can come up with $2327 this month nor next without your help. </p>

My husband continued to go to school, work and raise the children while I was trapped in my body and unable to help. 
2005 I did finally recover and we began to get our lives back in order once again when I had a stroke. It greatly affected my language center which, I would later learn, effectively wiped out the languages I had previously known, such as Indonesian, Malaysian, French, and German. For the next year I sounded somewhat drunk but my mind was seemingly normal aside from the foreign languages. In college I was intending to get my Bachelors of Arts degree but when I tried to take French class. Not only was the French no longer there in my brain, I could barely retain any new French language. Foreign language is a requirement for a Bachelor's of Art degree. Instead of giving up I changed my degree to a Bachelors of Science and began taking all of the needed science courses to apply to that degree change.
2008 School went well until early March 2008 when I had another attack of quadriplegia, this time just from my torso down. I was able to continue with school after taking a few weeks off to adjust to navigating campus in an electric wheelchair and training my dog to carry my books and sit quietly for long stretches in a classroom setting. I continued straight on until nearly my last classes. I only needed one quantitative and one qualitative course to graduate but if I added two Art History classes I would also get my minor in Art History. 
2009 That Summer I was anticipating being finished with my undergraduate degree very soon. Through it all I had maintained a high GPA and felt like the hard part was behind me. I was very close with my father and he was quite vocal with anyone who would listen about how proud he was of me. I spoke with him regularly but I had noticed he was beginning to be behaving strangely and his posts on Facebook were increasingly strange. Around the same age my father now was, his father had committed suicide. So I asked him, point blank, if he was intending to kill himself. He swore up and down that he wasn't. He unfriended me on Facebook that week but a few weeks later he re-friended me. He again swore that he wasn't planning on ending his life yet on September 9th he did just that with a bullet to his head. He apparently believed that 09/09/09 was an auspicious date and that he would be reunited with a long lost love that day in heaven.
I withdrew from school that Fall to go to Arizona and take care of his things and his funeral (there wasn't anyone else in his life to do it) and planned on returning in Winter to school. Unfortunately that December I had another severe attack, much worse than most of the ones before. No treatment was helping and it looked like there wasn't going to be any way to overcome it this time around. I also developed a melanoma on my leg that took two surgeries to fully remove and a year later they would tell me that I had uterine cancer, the same cancer my mother was dying from. Fortunately, the uterine cancer was a misdiagnosis. 
2011 By Fall I was chronically ill and figured that I had a year or so left in me. In December I had developed a serious sinus infection and went to the clinic to get antibiotics. The usual doctors weren't there so a specialist who volunteered at the clinic once a month saw me instead. As he was looking over my chart he remarked that I was one of the luckiest people in the world. When I asked him why on earth he would even think that, he said that he was pretty sure I had been misdiagnosed all this time and, if so, that my life was about to change tremendously. The disorder he was suspecting happened to be his specialty, a specialty that a very small number of doctors in the whole country would have recognized.
2012 January A round of tests were run and it was verified that I did not have MS or Muscular Dystrophy but had actually been born with a genetic inability to absorb B-vitamins called Homocystenuria and it is fully treatable. These days every baby that is born in the US is tested for it at birth when they draw blood from the heel prick. They are testing for homocystenuria as well as phenylketonuria. After decades of wrong turns and false hopes I didn't believe a word of it. He then showed me the vitamin levels in my tests. Every single one was severely deficient--not just all of the B-Vitamins but all of them--calcium, magnesium, zinc, vitamin D, etc. We began treatment.
March By March I felt like I was a teenager again! It was BEAUTIFUL!! And hard to believe that it would be like that forever but I immediately took advantage of it and began to take steps toward getting my life back.
At that same time we were living in student housing while my husband was finishing his Masters in Management degree. We found out that the University needed to tear down our house and move us into a different one. We moved while I looked for a job. I still was challenged by bone and joint problems stemming from the dengue fever I contracted in Indonesia and the decades of damage done by having vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Although they do cause pain, the overall quality of my life is extraordinarily better than it has been since I was a kid.
May I found a position at an amazing local non-profit called the Hospice Unique Boutique. It is a high quality resale boutique that supports end-of-life care programs and last wishes in the Rogue Valley. In their first year they were able to gift $5000 to those programs, in their second year they gifted $10,000. This year they gifted $30,000!!! I accepted the position as the Assistant Manager. It is the most wonderful shop to experience and the most rewarding place I have ever had the pleasure to support. If you are from this area you have to check it out (www.hospiceuniqueboutique.org), or friend them on Facebook and you will see what I mean.
Around the time that we moved is when I contacted the Department of Education and Direct Loans to get back to school. They told me that they would put my loans into forbearance, because we were too poor to pay any loans at the time, and then when I returned to school again in Fall it would automatically roll over into deferment while I was a student. 
June During the next few months my eldest daughter graduated from high school, my youngest daughter graduated from middle school, we became short-term foster parents for another girl and we moved my eldest daughter to Portland to attend Portland State University as a double major in Physics and Theatre.
October I returned to school and felt overjoyed! Being is school is tremendously rewarding for me and all of the possibilities of having my degree are very close at hand. I love to learn, I love the academic environment and I love the daily challenges. I am grateful to be there every single day.
November I am now going into finals with one Max/MSP/Jitter Programming class, and two 400 level Art History classes. But this week, November 26th, 2012, I found out that my student loans had not actually been sent to forbearance but instead were in default because they say they sent me paperwork in March that I didn't return to them. I don't doubt that they sent the paperwork but I have not seen it. This would have been during the time we were moving, so it likely got lost in the shuffle. All this time that I thought that my loans were in forbearance and rolling into deferment they weren't and now it is too late to fix it.
December In order to correct it I have made arrangement to make 10 months of payments which will get the loans out of the default status. But right now I have to pay for this term, which is $2327.29 and the upcoming next term which will be around the same. If I can't do that by December 28th then I am likely to lose my student house and have to move, which I don't have the funds for either. And I won't be able to finish my degree nor go in to the Master's program where they have already told me they would love to have me.
My husband has recently started his own business after months of unsuccessful job hunting. He does web design and marketing for restaurants and has recently obtained his first client but because he has just started this business he has only made a small amount of money and my work only earns enough to cover our basic costs. There is no way that we can come up with $2327 this month nor next without your help.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi Everyone!<br/> I'm Marguerite and I was born in Haiti but raised in Brooklyn,New York. My family moved to America because my father has Polycystic Kidney Disease and he could not get adequate treatment in Haiti.</p>
<p>In January 2010 I graduated from CUNY Brooklyn College with a BS in Business Administration, but by October 2009, having taken an intro to acting class and seeing my brother perform in a play at Amherst College I got the acting bug. Right after I got that degree, (going to school full time and working part time) I started to read books about acting and researching where I should start. I auditioned and got the opportunity to be part of some projects but it was only reading William Esper's <em>The Actors Art and Craft</em> that I became serious. I joined the William Esper Studio and decided to dedicate my life to it because I realized that acting had chosen me. And right when I decided to do this, my father, who had been on a waiting list for eighteen years, received a kidney. I felt the stars were aligning.</p>
<p>I am proud to say that as of June, I am a graduate of the Esper Studio(listed as one of the Top 25 drama schools in the world) class of 2013. And even prouder to announce that I have been accepted into the Masters of Arts Theatre Lab program at the<strong> Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts</strong> in London(listed in the Top 10 of the Top 25 drama schools). One out of hundreds who applied.</p>
<p><em>But it is expensive!!</em></p>
<p>This fundraiser is setup to help me with the cost of the program and housing. I fully intend on getting a job to support myself.</p>
<p>The door is open, I just need to walk in there. This is where I need your help.</p>
<p>Besides being a hard and dedicated worker, this opportunity is important to me because I truly believe that the Arts can positively impact the world,creating a sense of peace. Being part of RADA's MA Theatre Lab program is how I can better learn to spread that peace.</p>
<p>I act to share stories and to make connections in a world where a lot of us feel lost and alone. A great work of Art can show us not only the idea but give us the feeling of connection. I think the feeling is what we need most of all.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Okay here we go! Specifics for the money, where your money is going and why you can trust me:</p>
<p>I'm asking for $40,000 which includes the course payment and housing accommodation for 51 weeks. This includes the fee deductions for Indiegogo and payment processing fee. This will leave me with approximately $1,600 which can cover my student visa fee and a flight to London.</p>
<p>The total amount for the course is £14,000 = $21,548.80</p>
<p>Student housing, which will be at PURE Hammersmith is £13,014.85 = $20,032.69</p>
<ul>
<li>this includes rent for 51 weeks: laundry, Internet service and utilities. (This will make the follow up emails a lot easier to send , as well as research for any school projects.</li>
<li>the location for the housing is 35 mins away from RADA and a safe area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making the total £27,014.85 = $41,367.83</p>
<p>I have put in all the savings that I have towards this<br/> This amounts to $6,000 =£3,898.</p>
<p>I'm putting this toward paying for the course so<br/> £14,000 - £3,898 = £10,102</p>
<p>The remaining cost are<br/> £10,102 + £13,014.85 = £23,116.85 = $35,442.75</p>
<p>I'm asking for $40,000 to cover the price of the plane ticket and Indiegogo's cut.</p>
<h3>ARE WE READY FOR THE PERKS???<br/> -YEAH YOU ARE!</h3>
<p>Besides my deepest gratitude, there will be tangible thank you gifts. I am not much of a social networker, but I understand I'm not doing this alone even if I'm the only one going to London. Every person that helps is there with me and I want to show my appreciation and share my journey with them. Therefore, on my Actor's Business page I will have a cover photo and you will be included in it. There are personalized E-cards, Thank You Cards, Follow up emails (with photos) about my experience AND an invitation to join me for a going away get together with my closests friends/family.</p>
<h3>WHAT HAPPENS IF.......</h3>
<p>If I do not reach my goal:</p>
<p>Indiegogo allows me to keep the money I raised even if I don't reach the fundraising goal so your gift will help with the cost no matter what.</p>
<p>The first thing the money I raise will go to is towards housing, this is because RADA offers a payment plan that spreads the cost over the length of the program. I will be working so I hope to be able to pay it with my wages.</p>
<p>SO YOUR MONEY IS NOT WASTED! It will help to provide me with a roof over my head.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of Art is hard to define and the impact of an artist, of helping someone become a better artist, is even harder. I believe that Art can bring people together by reminding us of our essential nature, which I believe tends toward compassion, kindness and love. A great work of Art can break through the crust of everyday life with all of its fears, worries and tensions and open us to a deeper, truer reality. We can find ourselves, our real selves which then can open us to the possibility of change.</p>
<p>A work of Art can't cure a disease, stop a war, or heal the planet but if it can open the heart of even one person to his or her essential self then maybe that person can go out and effect some positive change in our world.</p>
<p>I want to be the kind of artist that has the ability to break through the crust of our daily lives and open up to a deeper reality. I know the ability to do this is the work of a lifetime, but I believe this program at RADA is an important step to getting me there. But I need your help to get there.</p>
<p>Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time.<br/> Thomas Merton</p>
<p>Art is the only way to run away without leaving home.<br/> Twyla Tharp</p>
<p>The essence of all beautiful art, all great art, is gratitude.<br/> Friedrich Nietzsche<br/> Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<h3>You can contribute in many ways!</h3>
<p>If it isn't the right time to give financially, DO NOT FRET!,you can still support by telling your friends and family and definitely coworkers about this campaign. Maybe they can help.</p>
<p>From the bottom of my heart, thank you in advance!<br/> Marguerite</p></div>","Summary

<h2>What is The Olio?</h2>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Coming soon to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, The Olio plans to be open for full programs by Fall 2013!</span></h3>
<h3>Located in the new re-development project called West End Mill Works, The Olio will be a HOT GLASSBLOWING STUDIO, ARTS APPRENTICE PROGRAM for local YOUTH ages 14-20, a Gallery and retail operation, Artist Mentorship Program, Business Incubator Program and many other community programs all highlighting our core values: ARTS, EDUCATION, COMMUNITY, and SUSTAINABILITY.</h3>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help! We have a solid plan and a great revenue stream once we are open; however all the planning in the world doesn't change the fact that we are not able to fund this program by ourselves. We have two campaigns planned, the first one is only 60 days and we need to raise $150,000 to start ordering equipment and pay for our share of the construction. That's a lot of money and not much time, but we are confident that you, our community, will be excited enough to get us there and in time!</p>
<p>In total we need $350,000 to build a state of the art studio, complete with UL certified (safe and secure!) equipment built right here in North Carolina by Wet Dog Glass. Construction began January 2, 2013 and we are optimistic we will be moved in by mid-year. We are starting our fundraising with this indiegogo campaign for $150,000, as we will seek funding through numerous channels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have made a few sample perks in our home studio while we wait for the construction to finish at the hot shop, but the bulk of them will be made in the fall when we are open so please be patient!</p>

We have made a few sample perks in our home studio while we wait for the construction to finish at the hot shop, but the bulk of them will be made in the fall when we are open so please be patient!



 
 

 
 
 
Here is a photo of the keychains, feel free to specify which color family you want, like blues, greens, etc..we will do our best to send you one you will love! 
 
 
 
 
 

 
These glasses were made from glass bottles with enamel labels. Thanks to Markus Parker for making the samples for us! And please get in touch if you have empty bottles for us, we have already started collecting them!
 
 
 
Don't forget, all our products are made from recycled and repurposed materials!

 
For example...these coasters are ceramic tile leftover from our in-laws' bathroom, magazine covers, fabric and glue! They are all unique and a definite conversation piece!

Please, please consider sharing your generosity with the The Olio and our wonderful programs for kids, families, adults, you. $5, $50, $5000....every penny will go towards the purchase of glass equipment, construction, ventilation and the glass studio that will be an exciting and fun place for you to enjoy.
The Olio is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, so all donations are tax-deductible. We are also applying for grants, foundation contributions, corporate sponsorship and various other funding sources.  Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have a desire to contribute separate from this indiegogo campaign. 
We want our community, local and online, to participate and show the world that this is a great approach to arts education and entrepreneurship! Our first campaign is quick - 60 days to raise $150,000 and we think we can do it!
 


How Does This Affect You?
By participating in this fundraising effort you are investing in your own enjoyment and future. If you are local you can take a workshop, buy a unique gift, watch live glassblowing, be an apprentice, mentor, incubated business...or if you are online you can purchase work made by apprentices in our online store, watch videos of glassblowing, design your own piece via skype! There many ways for people to participate in art-making and entrepreneurship, we are eager to open and show you all of our plans.
This space, this program, will not only bring hot glass to the Triad, it will bring about an exciting, fun and effective way to teach entrepreneurship, sustainability, and community. We look forward to sharing it with you!

By setting the example of health and happiness in their lives, they are creating healthy lifestyles for generations to come. <br/><br/><br/>The three individuals chosen will be personally trained by me to learn how to effectively deal with chronic stress.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hi! My name is Kjerstin, and I need help graduating from Arizona State University!  Last semester was supposed to be my final semester.  I was excitedly preparing to move on to the next phase of my life: pursuing a graduate degree in ministry.  Unfortunately, I received some bad advice from my advisor and found out too late that I would need to take one more class!  Tuition at ASU is astronomical.  Just one class, three measly credit hours, is $2,125! This doesn't include the cost of books and many of the other fees!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
I need about $3000.  I can pay it in three chunks, but the more i can pay now, the better. Any money that you so graciously donate will go directly towards paying for this class.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
After I finish this class, I will finally be able to graduate with a B.A. in Literature.  Once I graduate from ASU, I plan to go to Seminary and get a degree in Children's Ministry.  I am passionate about loving children and buidling them up to be healthy individuals.  By helping me graduate from ASU, you will be helping me get one step closer to realizing my dream!  Thank you so much!</div></div>","Short Summary

Samuel smiled and said, ""Great! You will be our President!"" and Sayydah replied, ""Ok!""  Two complete strangers spiritually believed that there was a more profound purpose for the African safari.  Samuel is the very first Samburu Warrior in history to found an organization to eradicate FGM and forced marriages. We're so honored to have him as our Founder &amp; Director of Samburu Circuit!  </span></p><p>The following week, Sayydah continued on safari to Maasai Mara and became instant friends with Joyce Nashipae Koitumet, a receptionist at the eco-tented camp. She, too, offered to help and is our Founder &amp; Director of Maasai Mara Circuit. </p><p>We recently celebrated our first year anniversary as a nonprofit! The journey is so exciting as we continue to network and partner with other like-minded individuals and organizations around the world.  The encouragement and support of our friends and donors keep us going, as do the people in the communities we serve. They're our biggest cheerleaders!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/231488/files/20131129114408-100_2418.JPG?1385754248"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b></b><p style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Sayydah with her new friends at Namayiana Village, Samburu, Kenya</b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p><p><b></b></p><h3><b>What We Need &amp; Your Impact</b></h3><p></p><p>To date, we've sponsored 6 girls in primary and secondary boarding schools in Samburu and Maasai Mara. Our goal is to sponsor 30 more girls in 2014. In addition, we will start our community mobilization, sensitization and educational programs on the harmful effects of FGM and childhood marriage, HIV/AIDS prevention, teen pregnancy and child rights. The workshops are for children, teens, adults and elders.  Activities will include plays &amp; drama, video presentations, public barazas, and village visits. We'll implement safe and fun <b>Alternative Rites of Passage</b> where girls will attend secluded and uninterrupted retreats to learn about sexual reproduction, reproductive health, family life skills, and personal hygiene, followed by a community-wide celebration for the abandonment of FGM. Time is of the essence! The next round-up of girls for circumcision ceremonies is in August during school holidays. Here's what the girls are NOT looking forward to: <a href=""http://pastoralist-child-foundation.org/causes/ending-female-genital-mutilation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FGM Facts</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> Female Genital Mutilation is illegal in every country around the world. Yet, it is openly and oftentimes secretly performed on innocent girls as young as 5 years old.  This is downright horrific, especially when young girls are prevented from attending school because they're forced to get married. This just doesn't make sense in our day and age when all girls, no matter where they live or their families' financial circumstances, should be allowed to go to school.  Pastoralist Child Foundation alligns with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. These goals state that every child in the world should have access to education by the year 2015. We're deeply committed to this goal and it's time for action.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
</span></p><p>Quality girls’ education empowers by
giving them choices, alleviates poverty and yields great returns in
socio-economics, health, population and politics. Girls’ education leads to
increased income for girls themselves, but also for nations as a whole. Better
educated girls become women who have smaller, healthier families with lower
infant mortality rates, and maternal mortality. Primary education significantly
helps reduce infant mortality, and secondary education helps even more because women
know how to use health services, improving nutrition and sanitation, and taking
advantage of their own increased earning capability. In addition, girls who get
a quality education marry later when they’re better able to bear and care for
their children.</p>
<p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><i>Your support will make a huge impact by educating the overall community to support the acceleration of the abandonment of FGM and foster positive gender attitudes among girls.</i></b>   </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Funds raised in this campaign will be used to produce educational materials to assist in the program. We'll identify 120 activists, law enforcers, circumcisers and cultural custodians to attend 3-day training workshops. The 2014 goal is to decrease instances of FGM by 21%.  Together we can do this!!</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By financially supporting Pastoralist Child Foundation, you're making history by improving the educational and living standards of the beautiful Samburu and Maasai tribes. If all goes well and we raise our goal of $20,000 you will rescue 50 girls from undergoing FGM. If we exceed our goal, your impact will be even greater - giving more girls access to a formal education. We promise you that 100% of all donations from this Indiegogo campaign will go towards our educational programs.        </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/232779/files/20131130082027-DSCN1135.JPG?1385828427"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Christine, Carolyne and Ann are starting high school in January, 2014.</b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>A sponsorship of $1,200 pays for an entire year of private boarding school.</b></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/232793/files/20131130083121-brenda_and_sam.jpg?1385829081"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Brenda is our first sponsored student!

We'll implement safe and fun Alternative Rites of Passage where girls will attend secluded and uninterrupted retreats to learn about sexual reproduction, reproductive health, family life skills, and personal hygiene, followed by a community-wide celebration for the abandonment of FGM. Time is of the essence! The next round-up of girls for circumcision ceremonies is in August during school holidays. Here's what the girls are NOT looking forward to: FGM Facts Female Genital Mutilation is illegal in every country around the world. Yet, it is openly and oftentimes secretly performed on innocent girls as young as 5 years old.  This is downright horrific, especially when young girls are prevented from attending school because they're forced to get married. This just doesn't make sense in our day and age when all girls, no matter where they live or their families' financial circumstances, should be allowed to go to school.  Pastoralist Child Foundation alligns with the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. These goals state that every child in the world should have access to education by the year 2015. We're deeply committed to this goal and it's time for action.
Quality girls’ education empowers by
giving them choices, alleviates poverty and yields great returns in
socio-economics, health, population and politics. Girls’ education leads to
increased income for girls themselves, but also for nations as a whole. Better
educated girls become women who have smaller, healthier families with lower
infant mortality rates, and maternal mortality. Primary education significantly
helps reduce infant mortality, and secondary education helps even more because women
know how to use health services, improving nutrition and sanitation, and taking
advantage of their own increased earning capability. In addition, girls who get
a quality education marry later when they’re better able to bear and care for
their children.
Your support will make a huge impact by educating the overall community to support the acceleration of the abandonment of FGM and foster positive gender attitudes among girls.   Funds raised in this campaign will be used to produce educational materials to assist in the program. We'll identify 120 activists, law enforcers, circumcisers and cultural custodians to attend 3-day training workshops. The 2014 goal is to decrease instances of FGM by 21%.  Together we can do this!!By financially supporting Pastoralist Child Foundation, you're making history by improving the educational and living standards of the beautiful Samburu and Maasai tribes. If all goes well and we raise our goal of $20,000 you will rescue 50 girls from undergoing FGM. If we exceed our goal, your impact will be even greater - giving more girls access to a formal education. We promise you that 100% of all donations from this Indiegogo campaign will go towards our educational programs.        Christine, Carolyne and Ann are starting high school in January, 2014.A sponsorship of $1,200 pays for an entire year of private boarding school.Brenda is our first sponsored student!

</p><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>My name is Arielle, but my students know
me as Ms. Starkman...or even just Miiiissss (when they are hollering for me
from across the room).  I am the teacher of an elementary special
education class in a heavily impoverished and impacted part of the city of Los
Angeles, called Koreatown.  My school, the New Open World Academy is a
unique entity in Los Angeles Unified School District. We are a Kindergarten
through 12th grade, Title 1, span school where 88% of students are economically disadvantaged.  My students are in grades 2, 3, and 4 and have mild to
moderate learning disabilities and autism.  I teach a self-contained, multi-level special education class, which means that all of my students are with me in our
class for the greater part of the school day. The majority of my 2nd, 3rd, and
4th grade students currently read at Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten reading
levels.  Although my students have already fallen behind in reading, they
enjoy reading and are excited to learn.  Their eagerness to become better
readers is extremely inspirational to me.  I am thankful to have such a
driven class of young scholars who persevere, even when their disabilities set
them back. Seeing their ten, smiling, little faces, jumping up and down shouting, ""Good Morning Ms. Starkman!"" every morning when I pick them up,  is what makes my 6:15 alarm
every bit worth it!  I am asking for your support in funding the purchase
of intensive reading intervention materials for my students.  I truly
believe that each one of my students is an incredibly capable and intelligent, young
individual.  The sky is the limit for these little guys. Closing the gaps
they are currently experiencing in reading, will severely change the course of
the remainder of their educational careers and far beyond.  I firmly
believe that LITERACY is the key to a successful LIFE!</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I have some lofty goals for my students
and myself this year. All of my students will leave my class as readers in
June.  All of my students will raise their current reading levels not just
by a year, but by a year and a half. Although they are only 7, 8, 9, and 10
years old, I know that their success as middle schoolers, as high schoolers,
and in their futures as adults, rests this year in my hands.  When students
move up to the next grade without having made adequate reading progress, their
gap only grows and playing the game of catch up will continue to get harder and
harder.  </p>
<p>I would like to ask for your support in my
campaign to provide my students with high quality literacy intervention
materials.  It is my goal to provide each of my students with access to an
online reading intervention program, called Reading Eggs.  This software
provides students with highly interactive and individualized reading coaching and
progress monitoring.  Students are given an assessment to determine their
current ability level and are placed on a personalized path of instruction
based on sequential literacy stages. I was fortunate to gain access to a 1
month trial of this Reading Eggs program at the beginning of November and it
has been incredibly well received by my students.  As a result of this
program, I have noticed my students' interest in reading, and their
engagement in literacy based tasks grow tremendously. My students who have previously
avoided any type of reading activity, now come in in the morning asking, ""When are we going to use Reading Eggs?."" Some, have even been known to chant, ""Reading
Eggs, Reading Eggs"" throughout the day. I have witnessed my most
struggling student, gain confidence in his reading ability. In the last few weeks, he has begun to volunteer to read aloud to the class for the first time!  Unfortunately, our free class trial to reading eggs is almost up, and in
order for my kids to continue strengthening their reading skills, we need your
help.</p>
<p>Although literacy is the focal point in my
class, I have noticed that handwriting is also an area of need for my students.
 With our primary focuses being reading and math intervention, handwriting
instruction is an area of need that we struggle to fit in during the school
day.  Handwriting Without Tears is a way for students to work
independently to improve their handwriting.  This program (that is geared specifically to students with special needs) works with
students to improve the legibility of their writing through repetitive practice
writing high frequency words.  I am asking for your help in funding the
purchase of Hand Writing Without Tears workbooks for each of my students as
well.</p>
<p>Any additional funds raised beyond my
goal, will go towards funding educational field trips for my
students, as well as purchasing additional reading, writing, and math
intervention materials for our classroom.</p>
<p>In this season of thanks, I just
want it thank each of you for your immense support. I believe we can all be a
pivotal part of educating our next generation of citizens.  My students
and I are grateful for any size donation you are able to contribute towards our
classroom.   As an educator, I am thankful for my ten little
""buddies"" that have come into my life this school year.
 These wonderful little children give me a purpose everyday and help keep my passion for education always ignited.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>After studying elementary and special
education at the University of Delaware, I moved to Los Angeles as part of the
Teach For America program in June of 2012.  I was hired as a high school
special education teacher at the New Open World Academy in our fully inclusive
secondary program.  The expectation was for me to support my high school
students in being successful in their general education classes, to aid them in
fulfilling the state and district's requirements necessary for high school
graduation. But what no one told me when I was hired, was that my students
lacked almost entirely every pre-requisite skill necessary to be truly
successful. Most shocking to me was finding out that my students were reading
at elementary reading levels.  The majority of my students in grades 9
through 12 were reading last year at about a 3rd Grade level, and my eldest
student, a 19 year old and 5th year senior (who was just 3 years younger
than myself) was reading at a Pre-Kindergarten level.  Although their skill sets were more or less the same as the elementary students I worked with during my student teaching, the students I was now charged to work with, were just a mere year or two away from ""graduation.""  For many months, I remained truly baffled. How could almost 12 years in the public education system have failed
these students, MY students, so dramatically?</p>
<p>Before I began my work in Los Angeles, the
""achievement gap"" was only a hypothetical term to me. How could there
really be so much inequity in public education?  How could such a
glorified city like Los Angeles really be home to this? Although LA is a
city of pristine beaches, luxury cars, hollywood film sets, and fine shopping and dining, it is also a city of
tremendous and extreme economic disparity. Street to street, block to block,
zip to zip, the economic disparity is ever present, ever raging, and ever
ravishing. Individual, wealthier municipalities exist throughout the city, many
with their own school districts. Weaving in and out of these municipalities,
starting and stopping, chopping streets in half, is the city of Los Angeles.
 To live in Los Angeles and have a Los Angeles zip code means that your
children are automatically students of America's second largest school
district, Los Angeles Unified.  For more fortunate families,
living within LAUSD boundaries more than likely means that your children will
become students of elite private schools.</p>
<p>As a special education teacher in Los
Angeles, I am charged with providing the students who are considered to be the,
""gap within the gap,"" with a high quality education. I wake up
everyday to work towards closing the overwhelming gap that exists simply within
the special education population in this urban community.  The disparity
between the performance of students with disabilities and the performance of
their general education peers is the ""gap within the gap."" </p><p>How
do we explain why high school students in this community, that have been classified as having mild learning disabilities, are
still unable to read independently?  How is it that these students are
still not able to correctly distinguish between short and long vowel sounds
when asked to read words ""The Crucible"" or ""Fahrenheit 451?"" How is it that many of these high school students
still need to be reminded regularly to start their sentences with a capital letter and
end them with a punctuation mark?  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If
we are attributing their tremendous gaps in achievement to a ""learning
disability,"" then how can it be that </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">all of the students who had learning disabilities from my own
New Jersey high school, ended up graduating high school on time and pursuing their bachelors degrees at competitive universities?  If the reason these students cannot read is just because of their, ""learning disabilities,"" then
why is it that my overpriced college textbooks didn't define learning
disabilities as something so debilitating, that it would prevent
you from meeting high school graduation requirements? OBVIOUSLY THERE IS
SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER GOING ON HERE.</span></p>
<p>My experience teaching high school last
year,  left me feeling empowered to be proactive in making a difference
in how we educate our elementary students with learning disabilities, so they
too, do not end up as functionally illiterate high schoolers.  Too
often in special education, we are forced to be reactive. Our students' gaps
manage to grow so big that we are constantly trying to feed them the knowledge
they need just to ""catch up"" or ""get by.""  Our goal becomes simply for them not to sink.  By doing this however, we are only
facilitating the growth of their achievement gaps because we are not helping students to build up their basic skills.  We are teaching them to hold their head above water, instead of how to swim.  As special
educators, we need to be proactive in preventing this game of catch up from
ever starting.  This is exactly what I intend to do as an elementary
special education teacher. </p>

and they want him back!  Word has spread of Pagna’s success with 
teaching English to the children of Kampong Phluk and the community of 
Lvea Village has been pleading with him to return home and open a 
school.</p>
<p>In December of 2013 we set up a temporary school under Pagna's father's house in Lvea Village. Within three days 152 children enrolled!  Pagna teaches them in five classes per day, five days per week. While teaching the children outside isn't optimal, it is doable during the dry season. In June when the monsoon season begins, teaching the children outside will not be possible.  Pagna's father's house is too small and too old to support the weight of the students so teaching the children inside the house is not an option. That's where you come in!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Here are some of the costs we're looking at to get started:</p><p>- $9,000 for new building measuring 15 meters by 4 meters (approx. 49ft
 by 13ft)  which would include a classroom, a computer room, a room to 
house a Western volunteer teacher, two bathrooms for the children and a small 
library.  The building would be made of concrete and have a metal roof so it could easily withstand many years of monsoon season.<br/></p><p></p><p>- $400  covers the cost of desks/chairs for the classroom and computer room.</p>
<p>- $150 to dig a well.</p>If we don't reach our goal of $9550.00 we will start with a smaller building, perhaps just a classroom, and build according to available funds. <br/><p></p><p>If we exceed our goal we will put the money toward these items:</p><p>-$325 for supplementary workbooks for the children</p><p>- scholarships for our kids who want to further their education by attending University or vocational training.  Costs vary according to programs.  <br/></p><p>- $2300 gets us five laptop computers and a printer/copier.<br/></p><p></p><p>- $2000 for two solar units to power lights for the evening classes and to provide power for the computers.</p><p>If we further exceed our goal we would like to build a daycare center for younger children. All too often when both parents need to work the slightly older children have to stay home and take care of the younger children. We would prefer they come to class!</p><p> A daycare center would give us the opportunity to start enriching the cognitive development of the children at an earlier age and would also provide jobs for some of the women in the village.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>In 2010 Pagna began teaching free English classes to the children of 
Kampong Phluk.  He believes every child should have the opportunity to 
learn English and to get an education as this is their only hope of 
living more prosperous lives.   By learning English the children can 
secure jobs in the tourism/hospitality industry, thereby lifting 
themselves out of poverty.</p><p>When he began, Pagna had no school to teach in so he taught in his 
house during the wet season and under his house during the dry season. 
Thanks to the generosity of tourists passing by he was able to supply 
pencils and notebooks to the children.  Eventually a whiteboard, some 
desks and chairs were donated.  Today over 120 children are taught 
English at Pagna Language School KP in five classes per day, seven days per
 week.</p><p>Our mission is to provide a safe, fun, supportive environment where 
education and self-empowerment are of supreme importance. It is our goal
 to reduce impoverishment of the young and underprivileged in Cambodia 
and to enable them to create futures born of their dreams rather than 
live lives dictated by poverty. We aim to enable the children to 
overcome seemingly insurmountable odds in a holistic and sustainable way
 by providing them with the knowledge, skills and support they need to 
achieve economic independence and actively participate in their 
communities in positive and lasting ways.</p><p>None of this would be possible without the support of you – our 
volunteers, donors, supporters and friends who believe in our goal of 
awakening in each child the opportunity for a more meaningful and 
prosperous life.  <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Anyone and <strong>everyone</strong> can make make an<strong> impact</strong>.</p><ul>

believe that even though no one can do everything, everyone can do 
something.  It truly is amazing how much can be achieved with just a 
small amount of money from compassionate people like you and a helping 
hand from us.Lvea village is Pagna’s home village.  He was born and raised there 
and they want him back!  Word has spread of Pagna’s success with 
teaching English to the children of Kampong Phluk and the community of 
Lvea Village has been pleading with him to return home and open a 
school.
In December of 2013 we set up a temporary school under Pagna's father's house in Lvea Village. Within three days 152 children enrolled!  Pagna teaches them in five classes per day, five days per week. While teaching the children outside isn't optimal, it is doable during the dry season. In June when the monsoon season begins, teaching the children outside will not be possible.  Pagna's father's house is too small and too old to support the weight of the students so teaching the children inside the house is not an option. That's where you come in!What We Need & What You GetHere are some of the costs we're looking at to get started:- $9,000 for new building measuring 15 meters by 4 meters (approx. 49ft
 by 13ft)  which would include a classroom, a computer room, a room to 
house a Western volunteer teacher, two bathrooms for the children and a small 
library.  The building would be made of concrete and have a metal roof so it could easily withstand many years of monsoon season.- $400  covers the cost of desks/chairs for the classroom and computer room.
- $150 to dig a well.If we don't reach our goal of $9550.00 we will start with a smaller building, perhaps just a classroom, and build according to available funds. If we exceed our goal we will put the money toward these items:-$325 for supplementary workbooks for the children- scholarships for our kids who want to further their education by attending University or vocational training.  Costs vary according to programs.  - $2300 gets us five laptop computers and a printer/copier.- $2000 for two solar units to power lights for the evening classes and to provide power for the computers.If we further exceed our goal we would like to build a daycare center for younger children. All too often when both parents need to work the slightly older children have to stay home and take care of the younger children. We would prefer they come to class! A daycare center would give us the opportunity to start enriching the cognitive development of the children at an earlier age and would also provide jobs for some of the women in the village.The ImpactIn 2010 Pagna began teaching free English classes to the children of 
Kampong Phluk.  He believes every child should have the opportunity to 
learn English and to get an education as this is their only hope of 
living more prosperous lives.   By learning English the children can 
secure jobs in the tourism/hospitality industry, thereby lifting 
themselves out of poverty.When he began, Pagna had no school to teach in so he taught in his 
house during the wet season and under his house during the dry season. 
Thanks to the generosity of tourists passing by he was able to supply 
pencils and notebooks to the children.  Eventually a whiteboard, some 
desks and chairs were donated.  Today over 120 children are taught 
English at Pagna Language School KP in five classes per day, seven days per
 week.Our mission is to provide a safe, fun, supportive environment where 
education and self-empowerment are of supreme importance. It is our goal
 to reduce impoverishment of the young and underprivileged in Cambodia 
and to enable them to create futures born of their dreams rather than 
live lives dictated by poverty. We aim to enable the children to 
overcome seemingly insurmountable odds in a holistic and sustainable way
 by providing them with the knowledge, skills and support they need to 
achieve economic independence and actively participate in their 
communities in positive and lasting ways.None of this would be possible without the support of you – our 
volunteers, donors, supporters and friends who believe in our goal of 
awakening in each child the opportunity for a more meaningful and 
prosperous life.  Other Ways You Can HelpAnyone and everyone can make make an impact.

I major in Directing, Play-writing and Production and minor in Musical Theatre. As an artist and student I believe it is important to study abroad to get a wider understanding of my chosen career path. At my University the specific study abroad program I chose to participate in is during winter break. Since this specific study abroad program is during winter break and not during a fall or spring semester the cost is separate from my tuition. However, this program allows me to get three credits and the experience of a life time. The trip is all inclusive and so the total cost of the trip is not unreasonable in anyway. The cost covers airfare, housing, meals, tours, theatre productions, workshops and more. The total cost of the trip is $3200. I already paid a non-refundable security deposit of $500 which was deducted from the total amount. This leaves me with a balance of $2700.  Unfortunately, I do not have enough funding to support my travels and it is with great humility that ask for the generosity and support of you to help me reach my goal. I am currently working two jobs as well keeping up with my studies in school. Even with working I still will not raise enough to pay for off the remaining balance for the trip.

<p>The only place I know is Philadelphia. It has been my home and my world for as long as I can remember. I grew up here, attended elementary school, middle school and high school right here in Philly. As the years have passed, my love for this place has grown tenacious and perpetual. After years of growing up in this familiar place I find myself attending college here as well. Philadelphia is a beautiful and resourceful place to explore your craft, define your talent and examine your growth as an artist; in spite of the city being a home for my heart it desires a holiday. I have never been out of the country, let alone off of the East Coast. And what better a place than London to be my first experience out of the Country? I want to take advantage of this opportunity while it is in front of me because I know there may be a chance of it never presenting itself to me again. Sure, I could easily turn down this opportunity and decide to go another year but who’s to say that year will come? One year may turn into two, and those two years could multiply. I have been in Philadelphia my entire life, and I know I will be here for the rest of my college experience. Seizing this opportunity will allow me to embark on a journey that will be life changing in every artistic approach possible. </p>
<p>  Studying abroad increases confidence, exposure and experience within the arts. Whether, a performing artist or a visual artist, traveling helps open the mind to a world of new possibilities for craft. Studying abroad strengthens tenacity both personally and professionally. It will help me gain an appreciation and better understanding for a foreign culture, prepares me to work in a diverse and international work place, and help expand my cross-cultural problem solving and communication skills. All of these points circle back to the arts and the importance of having the experience of another place; it’ll allow me to experience something new within my art.</p>
<p>  Directing, Playwriting and Production (DPP) is a one of a kind type of major. It is the only department in the country that allows me to have several focuses, yet somehow still allows me to have that one main focus. DPP is a combination of directing, playwriting, stage managing and producing. This department provides me with a broad understanding of the technical aspects of theatre and the pieces that help bring the stage life. Directing, Playwriting and Production allows artists, such as myself to have all the necessary skills to survive in the theatre world by pushing us not only to our full potential but past it. While studying abroad in London I expect to be exposed to a new culture. I will learn about the history of art there and the current art that is being created. I expect to learn a new dialect, a different way of speaking and be able to communicate and learn new ways of living.</p>
<p>  Studying abroad will give me a chance to spread my wings and fly. I’ve been a bird in the same tree my entire life and now I think I should leave the nest. Studying abroad will broaden my scope not only just within the arts but within life itself. It will give me an opportunity to see theatre in a different place and understand the how their technique can be different and can be the same. Not only is it something that will be good for me personally and academically but it is also something that will build my resume and my experience within my chosen profession.  London will be a great experience for me and I know it will forever have an impact on the work and art that I create.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Ever since the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where many of my neighbors were lost to a senseless act of violence, I have become passionate about reducing the epidemic of gun deaths in this country. I am working with a grassroots group called the Newtown Action Alliance to make sure that the Sandy Hook tragedy results in changes that make our schools and communities safer.  As a part of this strategy, the NAA organizes trips to Washington DC every three months to meet with lawmakers and the media to keep the issue of gun violence in the forefront.</p>
<p>I would like to go with the NAA to DC on September 17th-18th for the 9 month anniversary of the shooting.  And I would like to bring a gun violence victim, survivor or family member from another part of the country, with me.</p>
<p>It will cost approx. $500 to send me and a colleague from another community to DC for this trip so that our voices can be heard, and so we make sure that they do not forget.</p>
<p>I have pledged to raise money to help pay our way and I am asking for your support.   Even a small donation of $12.14 would be a helpful symbolic gesture. $26.00 would be even more symbolic and helpful.  Really, any amount you can offer would be terrific and very much appreciated.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Moved by the yearning for better education amongst the youth that could not otherwise afford high school fees in urban areas, we started Star of the land academy with the sole purpose to provide these youth with better education. The academy comprises orphaned children who are about 30%, and non orphans with huge financial struggles to afford basic education. The core wishes of the institution were to have; proper building structures, text books, laboratory, computers, sporting goods, electricity, food, and clean water. This has partially been realized since the academy was founded 10 years ago in 2003. Today the community boasts of well disciplined children with very good academic records that is evidenced from the Zonal and District exams. We have 7th grade as the highest  class, and we will be sitting for our very first national exam next year 2014.  The total number of children is 120, supported by a nine members staff team. Thanks to all the communal support we receive from the parents and the community at large. The institution is however faced with financial burden of supporting these children, especially the orphans who have none to look up to except you out there willing to hold their hands. While the intention and wish to support these children is very much real and alive, we are faced with the hard reality, that we dearly need you  to hold our hands. We are very much in need of basic education facilities. Not everybody is blessed financially to support us, but we do thank you in advance for taking time to get to know us. Please spread the word through this web page, facebook, word of mouth or any other way possible. Blessings.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The children of Star of the land academy dearly need your helping hand to help them realize their academic dreams. We will be very much grateful for  any  assistance towards achieving the basic education facilities. We thank you in advance even for the desire to help. We put the goal at US$12,000 which equals to ksh 1 million, that is meant for the above materials. If you are able to personally visit our school, feel more than welcomed. Our staff team are willing to shake your hand for a word of thank you. We appreciate whichever kind or form of assistance with which you bless this institution. Blessings.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign aims at reaching somebody out there willing to sacrifice to help us attain a better education at the Star of the land academy. People do not always help because they have an abundance, but due to sacrifice for a better end result. If only we could get better structures, text books, a source of light for studies, and clean water, Star of the land will be  an academic beacon to the community. We have the potential to compete with national schools in Kenya, but we do dearly need the basic education facilities.  I, Stephen started a youth group in our village called Homa Youth back in 2003, which has tremendously helped the other youth in the community. I still believe that my good and sincere intentions for this school, will touch someone out there to hold the hands of these children. A voice from Star calls for you to give them a chance for better education. Blessings. </p>

<p>The goal of this fundraiser is to raise enough money to have a meaningful impact in helping the families of the victims. Ideally, $500-$1,000 for each of the families would at least help offset some of the burial costs.</p>
<p>The 26 letters of the alphabet are representative of the 26 victims killed inside the school.</p>
<p>Please view videos that have been uploaded by parents and children in support of the effort here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/alphabet26?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/alphabet26?c=gallery</a></p>
<p>Though some other options are appearing for donations I felt that Alphabet 26 could be a better way of getting children and adults <strong>more 'actively' involved</strong>.<br/><br/>Once the fundraiser is completed, money will be donated evenly across all families by identifying a single next of kin or designated beneficiary OR by donating to a third-party organization with a verifiable and transparent method for distribution.<br/><br/>After the fundraiser is completed a determination will be made regarding the best method for distribution. Within two weeks of the completion of the fundraiser an announcement will be made to share the method of distribution and the date of distribution.<br/><br/><strong>Please Share Videos If You Can</strong><br/><br/>I thought it would be an incredible sign of support if you could have any children that recite their ABC's tape it on video and post the video link in the comments for this fundraiser on IndieGoGo. This is Eden, sharing her ABC's and her support... <a href=""http://youtu.be/n3y09fh3gRM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/n3y09fh3gRM</a><br/><br/>If you do post a video, please feel free to post it with the first name of the child [NO LAST NAMES PLEASE!], age of the child and the state you live in.<br/><br/>So it would look like this:<br/><br/>[YOUR VIDEO LINK] Kate, 6 from Minnesota</p>

<p> </p></div>","OverviewNOTE: You CAN donate any amount, large or small, and regardless of whether or not you have a child to recite the ABC's for you.
The goal of this fundraiser is to raise enough money to have a meaningful impact in helping the families of the victims. Ideally, $500-$1,000 for each of the families would at least help offset some of the burial costs.
The 26 letters of the alphabet are representative of the 26 victims killed inside the school.
Please view videos that have been uploaded by parents and children in support of the effort here:

Though some other options are appearing for donations I felt that Alphabet 26 could be a better way of getting children and adults more 'actively' involved.Once the fundraiser is completed, money will be donated evenly across all families by identifying a single next of kin or designated beneficiary OR by donating to a third-party organization with a verifiable and transparent method for distribution.After the fundraiser is completed a determination will be made regarding the best method for distribution. Within two weeks of the completion of the fundraiser an announcement will be made to share the method of distribution and the date of distribution.Please Share Videos If You CanI thought it would be an incredible sign of support if you could have any children that recite their ABC's tape it on video and post the video link in the comments for this fundraiser on IndieGoGo. This is Eden, sharing her ABC's and her support... http://youtu.be/n3y09fh3gRMIf you do post a video, please feel free to post it with the first name of the child [NO LAST NAMES PLEASE!], age of the child and the state you live in.So it would look like this:[YOUR VIDEO LINK] Kate, 6 from Minnesota
