<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Since 2005 YAQU PACHA supports scientists in Brasil with their activities and projects on protecting local populations of the bottle-nosed dolphin. The number of beached animals of this species has strongly increased over the last years. The majority of them have suffered from injuries induced by fishing nets. The work of Yaqu Pacha has helped ratify some new and improved fishing laws in Brasil which deal with coastal fishing. It is very likely that aquatic mammals in the region like e.g. the bottle-nosed dolphin will see a clear improvement in their living conditions.</span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""><br/></span>

Since 2005 YAQU PACHA supports scientists in Brasil with their activities and projects on protecting local populations of the bottle-nosed dolphin. The number of beached animals of this species has strongly increased over the last years. The majority of them have suffered from injuries induced by fishing nets. The work of Yaqu Pacha has helped ratify some new and improved fishing laws in Brasil which deal with coastal fishing. It is very likely that aquatic mammals in the region like e.g. the bottle-nosed dolphin will see a clear improvement in their living conditions.


Come join our campaign and support the Yaqu Pacha activities!

will stay with me forever. The book is the life story of a woman who overcame
extreme adversity, and did so without ever losing hope. While overcoming
adversity is a story often told, Tiffany’s is quite special. It takes you on a
journey as if you are right there with her experiencing the same fears,
helplessness, anger, joy and ultimately faith that God will always pull us
through the inevitable hardship of life. 
To her credit, not only does she carry on, but she does so with the

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><u><u><b>REMOVE THE TOXINS</b></u></u></b></b></h3>The basis of Tiffany Andersen’s Gavée
Gold Collection was made under the strict guidelines of the EWG (Environmental Working Group).  It has been her mission
to prove that cosmetics can be effective, without compromising consumer health.<br/><br/><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In order to support that mission, Tiffany first debuted Gavée Gold with a soft launch party supporting “Pink in the Park,” a
fundraising event for the fight against breast cancer. Tiffany donated over $15,000 in services
and products to support the event and will continue to raise awareness through special
events.</span><br/></p>

<p>Why would anybody want to use a product on
their skin that causes things such as loss of hair, eczema, psoriasis, mental
fatigue, headaches, or liver problems? The list of ailments is endless. When you use
products with toxic chemicals the conditions listed above may affect your body.</p>
<p>Our third party clinical studies prove Gavée
Gold will compete with medical grade products that use ingredients such as hydroquinone, which is toxic to skin cells. </p>

<p><b>Let’s get down to business.</b> What
makes us truly unique in a world where everyone is trying to jump on the bandwagon of natural and organic products?</p>
<p>Our primary top ingredients are organically produced and possess amazing therapeutic qualities. We use liquid gold, but we are not
“colloidal” or “nano-particle” liquid gold. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><u>Our liquid gold is organically extracted</u></b></p>
<p>What makes these elements so unique is that
they are truly “pure skin food”
that feed the deepest level of the skin. </p>
<p>Today, the precious metal is becoming
increasingly important in many modern day medical and beauty treatments.</p>
<p><i>“Gold is very resistant to bacteria and so is
often the material of choice for implants that are at the risk of infection,
such as the inner ear,” says Dr. Richard
Holiday, of the World Gold Council. </i></p>
<p><i>Historically gold has been known to slow down
the collagen depletion and breakdown of elastin to prevent sagging skin. It is believed that gold, stimulates cellular growth
of the deepest layer of the skin to regenerate healthy, firm skin cells, and
provide a tightening effect. Its anti-inflammatory properties are also thought
to decrease skin inflammation and seem to slow down melanin secretion and thus
reduce age spots.</i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i>We are...the future of anti-aging skincare.</i></b></p>
<p>But we don’t stop at “ organically purified liquid gold.""</p>
<p>We also use Cell Salts the ""salts of life"" </p>
<p>Cell salts replace all 12 vital minerals and were
based on the theory of Robert Virchow, a German doctor, anthropologist,
pathologist, biologist and pre-historian. Dr. Virchow was the founder of modern
pathology and father of social medicine. He worked with another biochemist by the name of William Schuessler. They found
that a lack of minerals in any of the 12 cell salts led to disease, but
replacing the missing minerals repaired the cells. They are not a medicine or a
cure, but a powerful rebalancing supplement. </p>
<p>The “salts of life” are infused in every one of
our products. So you know your skin will be healthy.</p>
<p><b>NO ONE IN THE WORLD has our organically purified elements.</b></p>
<p>This organic process is a proprietary blend that is highly labor intensive, therefore not seen in mainstream cosmetics. Through today's modern technology we are able to produce cutting edge formulas with hand selected unique ingredients from around the world. </p>

Finding Faith a memoir, written by Tiffany Andersen

A true story about love, life, tragedy
and hope. Tiffany Andersen describes the horrific events she lived through that eventually led Tiffany on a mission to teach people they can live with
“vitality” if they learn to repair the body naturally
– thus, the creation of the Gavée Gold Collection. REVIEWS ARE COMING IN!

""Finding Faith is an extraordinary tale of a young woman’s strength in the face of overwhelming adversity. Cheer for this brave young woman whose triumph in the end is a victory for all-who believe in faith, love, and God. This book is a must-read if you are losing faith in yourself and thinking everything is the end."" Datin Caberline Keok*In Malaysia, Datin is the wife of a Dato, a title denoting a membership of a
high order of chivalry. The Dato is conferred by a hereditary royal ruler of
one of the nine Malay states.

""Tiffany Andersen’s “Finding Faith” a memoir,
will stay with me forever. The book is the life story of a woman who overcame
extreme adversity, and did so without ever losing hope. While overcoming
adversity is a story often told, Tiffany’s is quite special. It takes you on a
journey as if you are right there with her experiencing the same fears,
helplessness, anger, joy and ultimately faith that God will always pull us
through the inevitable hardship of life. 
To her credit, not only does she carry on, but she does so with the
mission to help others. A wonderful read if you’re looking to find gratitude

Tiffany's mission in life is to provide people with vital information about how to repair the body naturally. This includes teaching others to not just
“survive” but “thrive” in life, and getting back to basics in order to live
well…

“It is not about AGE MANAGEMENT
and SURVIVAL...”
“It is WELLNESS MANAGEMENT and QUALITY OF LIFE...” 
“It is a LIFESTYLE CHANGE that
the world needs to recognize!”
Everyone wants to look their best; we all do. But at what price are we paying to achieve these results?
Over 80% of the skincare products sold today have ingredients that have industrial chemicals, including carcinogens, pesticides, reproductive toxins and hormone disruptors. These agents are cancer causing and harmful to your health. Can you imagine what they do to your skin?WE NEED TO....
REMOVE THE TOXINSThe basis of Tiffany Andersen’s Gavée
Gold Collection was made under the strict guidelines of the EWG (Environmental Working Group).  It has been her mission
to prove that cosmetics can be effective, without compromising consumer health.In order to support that mission, Tiffany first debuted Gavée Gold with a soft launch party supporting “Pink in the Park,” a
fundraising event for the fight against breast cancer. Tiffany donated over $15,000 in services
and products to support the event and will continue to raise awareness through special
events.

Why would anybody want to use a product on
their skin that causes things such as loss of hair, eczema, psoriasis, mental
fatigue, headaches, or liver problems? The list of ailments is endless. When you use
products with toxic chemicals the conditions listed above may affect your body.
Our third party clinical studies prove Gavée
Gold will compete with medical grade products that use ingredients such as hydroquinone, which is toxic to skin cells. 
Take a look at our clinical science studies.
EDUCATION
THROUGH MEDIA and MARKETING.
In today's competitive market, a manufacturer must have something unique, as well as safe, yet high-performing, genuine, and rare. 
These are all traits that the Gavée Gold Collection has!So why are we here?While there are always growing pains in every great beginning, we are extremely excited about the amount of recognition we have already received, and now we need your help to take it to the next level, to reach a broader market.In order for that to happen, we need to hit a minimum order quantity with each of our Founding Members and we are asking YOU to join the team in raising green awareness while looking and FEELING beautiful!
Let’s get down to business. What
makes us truly unique in a world where everyone is trying to jump on the bandwagon of natural and organic products?
Our primary top ingredients are organically produced and possess amazing therapeutic qualities. We use liquid gold, but we are not
“colloidal” or “nano-particle” liquid gold. 
Our liquid gold is organically extracted
What makes these elements so unique is that
they are truly “pure skin food”
that feed the deepest level of the skin. 
Today, the precious metal is becoming
increasingly important in many modern day medical and beauty treatments.
“Gold is very resistant to bacteria and so is
often the material of choice for implants that are at the risk of infection,
such as the inner ear,” says Dr. Richard
Holiday, of the World Gold Council. 
Historically gold has been known to slow down
the collagen depletion and breakdown of elastin to prevent sagging skin. It is believed that gold, stimulates cellular growth
of the deepest layer of the skin to regenerate healthy, firm skin cells, and
provide a tightening effect. Its anti-inflammatory properties are also thought
to decrease skin inflammation and seem to slow down melanin secretion and thus
reduce age spots.
We are...the future of anti-aging skincare.
But we don’t stop at “ organically purified liquid gold.""
We also use Cell Salts the ""salts of life"" 
Cell salts replace all 12 vital minerals and were
based on the theory of Robert Virchow, a German doctor, anthropologist,
pathologist, biologist and pre-historian. Dr. Virchow was the founder of modern
pathology and father of social medicine. He worked with another biochemist by the name of William Schuessler. They found
that a lack of minerals in any of the 12 cell salts led to disease, but
replacing the missing minerals repaired the cells. They are not a medicine or a
cure, but a powerful rebalancing supplement. 
The “salts of life” are infused in every one of
our products. So you know your skin will be healthy.
NO ONE IN THE WORLD has our organically purified elements.
This organic process is a proprietary blend that is highly labor intensive, therefore not seen in mainstream cosmetics. Through today's modern technology we are able to produce cutting edge formulas with hand selected unique ingredients from around the world.

<h3>What is SURU?</h3>
<p>SuRu is a premium apparel brand that promotes multiculturalism and diversity through fashion and lifestyle. The word SURU means ""To do"" in the Japanese language and ""Patience"" in the Yoruba language. The Yorubas are from West Africa, predominantly Nigeria, Togo and Benin.</p>

The similarities and correlation in the definition of Suru are fascinating given the geographic distance between these cultures.

But what we are is experienced in producing high quality products in a timely manner. Best of all, production is already on the way.
We promise to do everything within our capacity to mitigate any posing risks. We will make sure we stay engaged with our supporters and communicate any developments as they occur. We will open a forum for you to post questions so we can address your concerns as soon as possible. We will inform you on our progress, and we would like you to know that despite the fact that things tend to shift in our industry, we promise to rectify any issues that may arise.   Other Ways You Can Help 
To help make this pre-order campaign successful, we are asking friends, families, Indigogo patrons & community, and bloggers to help spread the word. We can only do this with your help.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is Undefined.?</h3>
<p>What is Undefined.? Undefined. challenges the concept of fixed ideas by establishing gender fluidity, versatility in design, and materials of choice.</p>
<p><strong>About Undefined.</strong></p>
<p>Undefined. Jewelry is a gender-fluid, handcrafted jewelry brand based in New York and Seoul, South Korea.</p>
<p>While fixed ideas and concepts create a common collective, they often transmute into unalterable structures that frequently fail at defining us. Undefined Jewelry see ‘labels’ as a deteriorating, imminently obsolete ideal and choose instead to focus on the artisans, who have previously been behind the scenes and often forgotten. Thus, catering our production process towards the interests of both the artists and consumers.</p>
<p>Emerging in November 2017, Project Undefined is dedicated to maintaining the quality of precious metals used, balancing the concept of value with fashion jewelry design. In being gender fluid, Undefined Jewelry disrupts the previous definitions and stereotypes of beauty to create an irreplaceable identity.</p>
<p>Handcrafted in New York, Undefined Jewelry supports local businesses while also functioning on an international scale by collaborating with artists globally. Rather than following a traditional fashion calendar, all the collections are project based and each designer focuses on a single piece so that the emphasis is given to the artistry of the work. Each collection evokes inspiration from fine art to create a unique line of rings, earrings, bracelets, and necklaces.</p>
<p>In being fluid in our choice of designs, precious materials, and methods of production, our project works to establish a new standard of beauty that is truly, undefined.</p>
<p><strong>About the Founder</strong></p>
<p>Brand Founder Kiera Junghyun Kim received her B.A. in Fashion Design &amp; Business in Korea. She began her career at a vendor company and continued as a fashion stylist and consultant, working with numerous editorials. Her previous clients include Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, W Magazine, Carhartt, MCM, and The North Face, to name a few.</p>
<p>She joined her family business as a marketing team leader and successfully launched an Italian private label in Korea. She built a brand website, an online marketing plan, and managed PR/editorial for the company. She distributed the brand to renowned department stores in Korea, such as the Shisnegae Lotte Department Store.</p>
<p>Since her experiences navigating different duties has allowed her to understand the whole scope of the fashion world, Kiera saw the traditional fashion business as an industry where the work of designers fail to get substantial credit and they are regarded as just another stage towards a final product. Kiera wished to create a brand that gave identity to the production process, creating something that people could truly support.</p>
<p>She came to New York to refine her ambition and challenge this institution at Parsons. She was eager to dedicate her knowledge and experience to build a fashion business using a platform to celebrate individual artistic creation and sustainable production methods.</p>
<p>She incubated the idea and concept throughout the whole program at Parsons School of Design and founded Undefined. in 2017. She was invited to speak to Parsons as a guest lecturer to share her insights about fashion trend forecasting, millennial culture, and how these factors ultimately apply to fashion branding.</p>
<p>Today, she continues her passion for the industry through the collaboration of distinguished artists and photographers such as Joshua Aronson, who created the print campaign for Off-White and was featured in the New York Times.</p>

<br/><h3>Purchasing Swades</h3><p><b>Please be sure to specify your Swades color </b>(Razor Red, Bougie Blue, White Hot, Posh Pink, Gecko Green) <b>in the comments box when purchasing.</b><br/></p><h3>Risks and challenges
</h3>
<p>Delivery time is approximated based on estimated production 
timelines.  If we're able to move into production and deliver earlier, 
we will definitely do so!</p>
<p>As with every product, there are some limitations.  We'd like to share a few of these upfront so you can keep them in mind.</p>
<p>1) Please note that Swades will initially be available as a one-size 
fits all product.  We are exploring alternative options (e.g., kids 
size) for the future.</p>
<p>2) Unless you're purposefully looking to lose them, we don't 
recommend that you skydive, go on a roller coaster, ski, attend an 
outdoor Hurricane party or the like in your Swades.</p>
<p>3) Swades do not fit on top of an existing pair of glasses.</p>
<p>4) Swades are non-prescription.</p>
<p>5) Actual border colors may vary slightly from images shown.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to keep you updated as our project progresses on Indiegogo.</p><p>Thanks!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","Introducing Swades!Welcome to the future, today.  We're proud to introduce you to our new product: Swades.  Swades are unique, stylish and fun.

As with any pair of sunglasses, protecting them is key.  Yet, 
we're all familiar with the frustration of big, bulky cases.  For 
Swades, that's exactly what we looked to purposefully avoid.  Our cases 
are small, but sturdy.  Stylish and easily portable.Wherever your travels take you, we're hopeful that you'll bring Swades along for the ride!Ready to RollWe're thrilled to share our project with you.  We hope that you're as
 excited about Swades as we are!  We think that Swades will quickly 
become the sunglasses you can afford to lose, but wouldn't want to.Thanks in advance for your support, it should be a fun four weeks!Swades - Unique. Stylish. Fun.
Purchasing SwadesPlease be sure to specify your Swades color (Razor Red, Bougie Blue, White Hot, Posh Pink, Gecko Green) in the comments box when purchasing.Risks and challenges

Delivery time is approximated based on estimated production 
timelines.  If we're able to move into production and deliver earlier, 
we will definitely do so!
As with every product, there are some limitations.  We'd like to share a few of these upfront so you can keep them in mind.
1) Please note that Swades will initially be available as a one-size 
fits all product.  We are exploring alternative options (e.g., kids 
size) for the future.
2) Unless you're purposefully looking to lose them, we don't 
recommend that you skydive, go on a roller coaster, ski, attend an 
outdoor Hurricane party or the like in your Swades.
3) Swades do not fit on top of an existing pair of glasses.
4) Swades are non-prescription.
5) Actual border colors may vary slightly from images shown.
We'll be sure to keep you updated as our project progresses on Indiegogo.Thanks!",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>","Short Summary
Hi, I'm Lila Morency. Some of you know me
from the last Indiegogo campaign but some don't. So here's a quick intro: I'm
Canadian/American and have been living in Italy for the past 7 years, 1 of
which was spent studying the language and culture, 3 years spent studying
fashion design at the Marangoni Institute of Milan, and 3 years working for a
luxury sports brand gaining experience in this complex field. 
A little over a year ago, I was inspired
to start my own brand: Lila Morency. Last September I presented my collection,
for the first time during the Milan Fashion Week, by doing a flash mob around
the city of Milan. Thanks to the help of my campaign supporters, the event was
a success. I was happy to see how many people supported me and wanted to be
part of this adventure. With the help of those like you who believe in new talents, I
know I will be able to grow in the fashion world!
What We Need & What You Get
In order for my brand to become known, it needs lots of advertising of all sorts: magazine articles, editorials, photographers, a PR group and much more. A brand
needs the flexibility to experiment new techniques to create innovative
garments. For this to happen, I am looking for one or more big sponsors. Sponsors
who will believe in my project and see it as a long term investment in return
for a percentage on the sales. Until I find those big sponsors, I need all the
help I can get, and that's where you all come in.
For this next presentation I would like to
create an avenue for art, photography, and fashion to mix. I am aiming to present my clothes in a venue similar to a gallery where many visual art forms can be displayed.
What you will get in return for your
support and funding is a window on the fashion world through photographs from
the event, my hand-drawn illustrations, and even accessories and garments from
the collection before anyone else gets to have them. I will also keep you
posted with updates in order for you to be able to follow the evolution of the work and see
the difference your contribution makes.
The Impact
My long-term goal is to increase people's awareness
of the impact that fashion can have on the eco-system. Many chemicals that
produce toxic waste and require higher energy consumption are used in the dyeing
process and the creation of synthetic fabrics. I will do my best to research and to find the highest
quality and most eco-friendly materials. We, as humans, are starting to pay
more attention to the way we treat our planet and I want my work in fashion to
contribute to that effort.
Other Ways You Can Help


No worries if you can't contribute
financially! I thank you just for the time you have taken to view my
campaign and I hope to have ignited a spark in you to pass the message on to
others because it is much easier to have an impact on the world if we all work
together. I hope to get many of you involved and excited about this fascinating
world of fashion!

<h1>
<b>STORY BEHIND KIMBERLY LANG</b>
</h1>
<p>Hey! </p>
<p>My name is Kimberly Lang. I love 
dancing, beautiful classy dresses, laughing and oh my good… cotton 
candy!!! But my passion and biggest love is designing pretty clothes for
 pretty women. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/991667/files/20141106110028-kimsolo.jpg?1415300428"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>2 Years ago I always had to deal with the problem 
to find the right clothes for my daily business. So I started to design 
the first clothes for my label Kimberly Lang. Half a year ago I 
started to develop the prototypes for my first collection. I thought if I
 cannot find what I want, I have to do it by myself </p>
<p>I believe 
that clothes can change your world. They can change your look, your 
mood, make you more self-confident and can even change your whole life! </p>
<p>Who
 does not know how it feels to be a totally different person in a cozy 
Jean, sweatshirt and sneakers as in a nice evening dress?This has a very
 simple reason: “Clothes make the man!”This saying everyone knows is 
true. And why shouldn`t we feel so well and radiate exactly what we all 
are?</p>
<p><b>UNIQE – BEAUTIFUL – STRONG – FEMININE</b></p>
<p>These are just a few characteristics that apply us women. </p>
<p>What
 I love the most about dresses is that you can express so much with your
 style and you don`t need a reason to wear pretty clothes. You can lead 
your day and have open possibilities. Every day in the office has not to
 be a normal working day any more. It can be YOUR day. </p>
<p>When I 
think about my target audience of my designs, I think about strong and 
beautiful women. And this is therefore a huge audience, because we are 
all strong and beautiful! My fashion speaks mostly to women, who work in 
offices. The number of women in such jobs is increasing, but in my view 
there is hardly suitable offer for high-quality and expressive Fashion. </p>
<p>My
 idea about fashion is not simply earn much money. It is about to give a
 positive feeling. Be it a woman, who feels like a strong and beautiful 
women, a working person, who exercises the craft as a seamstress, which 
is becoming increasingly rare in Europe, to fair and good conditions or 
even the 3% of my turnover, which will be donated directly to social 
projects in many years exploited industrial countries.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/991670/files/20141106110050-new.jpg?1415300450"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The clothes
 I design are timeless and classy. My main competence will be 
well-fitting blouses, which have a longer cut because it stretches your 
body and makes a good shape. They also have more buttons to avoid seeing
 into the blouse and will have also a back folding to ensure a good 
shape as well at the backside and secondly classy and timeless dresses. 
All my clothes will be manufactured exclusively in Europe. For sure we 
will use as well only fabrics and colour-save fabrics from Europe.For me
 it is not only a normal job for me designing and sewing is an exciting 
craft and it is exactly what I would love to do for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Each
 of us can do untold and let their dreams come true! My dream is to make
 women happy with my sustainable, high-quality designs. So please help 
me make my dream come true! Everything is ready and by supporting our 
project you will help us to fund our first collection. Please check out 
our rewards and pick your favourite one and please share this video to

<p>Thank you sooo much!</p>

This Is Not Your Average Pair of ShortsThe world doesn’t need another activewear brand.But it does need a new pair of training shorts.Your average pair of training shorts are plagued with problems.  In reality, the average pair of training shorts last just a few wears. Made using outdated fabric technology that absorbs sweat and heat, they cause you to overheat when active, leaving you cold and smelly when you stop.Looking like you just came from the gym is one thing – but smelling like it? Urgh. No thanks.Meanwhile, regular shorts companies use obsolete stitching techniques that often irritate your skin. Chafing occurs because of irritation caused by friction. Yet, traditional shorts materials get wet from sweat, bunch up and get heavier, creating more friction.Finally, there are problems with style, functionality, and colors. Traditional training shorts are boring, resulting in a closet full of low-quality active shorts that you rarely use.The world is ready for a new pair of training shorts. Welcome to the Hi-Flex™ Training Shorts 2.0. These sleek shorts perform like pros, wherever your day takes you.Hi-Flex™ Shorts are meticulously crafted with an invisible drawstring, superior waistband, sewn-in loop to hold towel/shirts during workouts, and multiple pockets: side pockets, zippered outside pocket on the back panel, and liner phone pocket (for the option with liner).   invisible drawstrings and superior waistbands,sewn-in loop to hold towel/shirts during workouts, Zippered side pocket,Liner phone pocket (available for the 'lined' option only),and multiple pockets: side pockets, zippered outside pocket on the back panel, and liner phone pocket (for the option with liner).A unique splash of color sets you apart in the gym, while the modern cut ensures freedom of movement, a flattering fit, and a sleek look. This combines to make Hi-Flex™ Training Shorts 2.0 something you can wear in fitness, urban, and outdoor environments.Time to throw those stinky old shorts away. Your new pair of all-day shorts has arrived. How Does it Work? Our training shorts are made from Hi-Flex™ – a proprietary polyester/elastane blend fabric technology that offers a smooth finish, lightweight feel, freedom of movement, four-way stretch, breathability, moisture-wicking, quick-dry, wrinkle-resistant, water-resistant, stain-resistant, and anti-odor properties. We were determined to deliver a fabric technology that was unimaginably innovative, which is why we spent countless hours on trials and testing before this groundbreaking, state-of-the-art material was born. Unlike traditional shorts, our Hi-Flex™ shorts do not absorb sweat. Your perspiration simply evaporates through the moisture-wicking breathable fabric, keeping the shorts dry and fresh.Our moisture-wicking fabric has two main duties: to quickly transfer sweat to the fabric's top layer, and quick dry so that your sweat doesn't soak through the fabric. Our proprietary HiFlex™ material was also strategically engineered to inhibit the growth of odor-causing bacteria.    Hi-Flex™ Fabric TechnologyOur fabric technology is groundbreaking.  When we set out to build all-in-one superior training shorts, we knew that we had to start from the fiber up.

Artificial fingernails allow women the ability to achieve the manicure of their dreams.  Women frustrated with the length or shape of their natural nails use the versatility of artificial nails to achieve the look they desire.  This simple invention has inspired many styles and nail art designs enabling the nail care and salon market to grow into a multi-billion dollar industry.
Nail fashion is constantly changing because women are continuously looking for new and exciting trends to enjoy!  Look no further!  Hello, I am Traska French-Artis inventor of Nautic Nails.  My twin sister Chaska French-Jackson and I are introducing Nautic Nails the most exciting and innovative patented nail art design that has ever entered the nail market.
What are Nautic Nails?

Nautic Nails are artificial fingernails with a built in cavity containing liquid, microbeads, and glitter.  The microbeads and glitter float around in the liquid creating a snow globe effect within the nail.  This is the only nail design in the world with the ability to move!
I invented Nautic Nails one ordinary day in 2004.  I thought to myself wouldn't it be cool if there were nails filled with liquid and glitter and the glitter could float in them?  Not one to be overly interested in artificial nails, I thought I will tell some other ladies and see if they agree.  The next day I talked to some of my female friends and my twin Chaska, and they thought the idea was great!  So, I set out to create a prototype.  After many failed attempts, long hours of breathing in sickening super glue fumes, aching fingers, and several trips to the hobby store, I did it.  I created a fully functional prototype that even the most savvy nail tech can not duplicate.  I immediately hired a patent lawyer and fought six long years to win a patent (U.S. Patent No. 7,856,993).

The Problem and How You Can Help
Although many women and companies all over the world have wanted to buy Nautic Nails,  we have been unable to meet demand because we can only make orders by hand.  We are in need of a mold that can mass produce the nails, but the mold is very expensive.  That is why we need your help!   With your contributions and orders we will be able to eliminate this obstacle to making our dream come true.

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>This project came out of a discussion on Scubaboard.com. After purchasing the extremely popular DRIS1000 Flashlight I began to look for a good way to carry it with me underwater while scuba diving. When I couldn't find anything on the market to suit my needs I decided to create a design myself. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><em>Please note all images are computer generated. Actual product may show slight variations due to construciton.</em></h3>
<p>Using scubaboard.com to get feedback on my idea, we evolved to this final design. You can see the original discussion that led to this design here: <a href=""http://www.scubaboard.com/forums/lights/429772-there-any-interest-goodman-style-handle-dris-1000-500-lights.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.scubaboard.com/forums/lights/429772-there-any-interest-goodman-style-handle-dris-1000-500-lights.html</a></p>
<p>As a product designer I put to use my skills in design, manufacturing and sourcing to created a versatile handle that will fit more that just the DRIS1000 light and uses off the shelf stainless steel hardware so that you can replace the hardware if necessary yourself. </p>
<p>Fits flashlight diameter 1"" to 1.5"" with existing hardware. However you may want shorter bolts for a 1"" diameter flashlight.</p>
<p>If you purchase longer bolts (3"" length) the handle will fit flashlight diameters up to 2""</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.konalu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/large-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Since this is a very small run project to a very specific market I had to get creative with the manufacturing. I utilized manufacturing techniques that help to control costs and the final product will be manufactured overseas.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My original goal in this project is to get together a group of buyers so that I can make this handle at a low cost and I can get a couple of them for my own use. To try and make just one handle would not be cost effective. By making 100pcs I am able to get the individual unit price down.</p>
<p>By supporting this project you will receive 1 goodman handle of my design. It is manufactured from anodized aluminum and stainless steel hardware with stainless steel nylon insert locknuts.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The cost of the project reflects the actual cost of manufacture and shipping to me from the overseas manufacturer as well as a very small profit to help reimburse me for the time spent designing and sourcing this project. </p>
<p>*Edit* I accidentally chose flexible funding on this campaign so it will proceed whether or not the full funding amount is reached. I will place the order with the factory towards the end of the campaign. *Edit*</p>
<p>After the close of the project it will take approx. 30days to produce the handles and begin shipping them.</p>

<p><strong>Stephanie Quirk is</strong> currently a full-time teacher of Visual Arts at a Sydney High school. She is an artist, a natural educator, explorer, and adventurer and is excited about merging these passions in her life-long dream - climbing Mount Everest! Alongside this, she has a black belt in Shinbudo Martial Arts, has visited China where she studied under Shaolin Monks for 4 months in a remote monastery, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, undergone a mountaineering course in America and next week is walking from Sydney to Newcastle in a Santa outfit. </p>

<p>But conviction is only a part of the equation. Action, support, trial and error and bold moves are all steps required to move towards realising your dream. Your support in achieving my dreams  is a key element in building a foundation of mental fortitude, social support, and financial backing that will help me achieve my biggest goal yet, to climb the highest mountain in the world. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">This goal cannot be taken lightly, The Everest environment has jet streams that blow all year and winds can reach 321km per hour, temperatures drop to -60°  and oxygen levels at the pointy end are 66% less than sea level. </span>With your funding &amp; support, I will be able to buy specific mountain equipment, which in a very real way will be aiding my survival on the mountain.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">  In extreme cold weather, high altitude double boots for prevent frostbite and expedition down outer layers insulate body temperature.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Gear lists for expeditions are often exhaustive, but the items that I require for Everest are the same for many of the peaks that I will climb in the lead up to the big mountain. Aconcagua, is my second peak which I am attempting in January. It is the highest mountain outside of the Himalayas, and although not technical (no steel ladder crevasse crossings yet) it is oh so high, standing at 6,961 meters and very cold at -15° . The gear I invest in now will be with me on Aconcagua and serve me the following peaks until I get to the roof of the world! </p>

The AIN'T NOTHIN GONNA BREAK MY STRIDE  campaign is a rally-cry. It is a call to anyone who has a dream and believes in themselves to make it a reality. It is important to me because I think with the power of self-belief and conviction, no matter how far-out your dream may seem, it is absolutely possible. 
But conviction is only a part of the equation. Action, support, trial and error and bold moves are all steps required to move towards realising your dream. Your support in achieving my dreams  is a key element in building a foundation of mental fortitude, social support, and financial backing that will help me achieve my biggest goal yet, to climb the highest mountain in the world. 
This goal cannot be taken lightly, The Everest environment has jet streams that blow all year and winds can reach 321km per hour, temperatures drop to -60°  and oxygen levels at the pointy end are 66% less than sea level. With your funding & support, I will be able to buy specific mountain equipment, which in a very real way will be aiding my survival on the mountain.  In extreme cold weather, high altitude double boots for prevent frostbite and expedition down outer layers insulate body temperature. These items of clothing are fundamental to self care on the mountain, allowing me to function safely when traversing up and down.

 
What We Need & What You Get
Gear lists for expeditions are often exhaustive, but the items that I require for Everest are the same for many of the peaks that I will climb in the lead up to the big mountain. Aconcagua, is my second peak which I am attempting in January. It is the highest mountain outside of the Himalayas, and although not technical (no steel ladder crevasse crossings yet) it is oh so high, standing at 6,961 meters and very cold at -15° . The gear I invest in now will be with me on Aconcagua and serve me the following peaks until I get to the roof of the world! 
 
Here is a break down;






Each item is essential on the mountain and will get me one step closer to the top!

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Hello, we're the founders of DripShip (from left to right - Chais Meyer, Shawna Meyer &amp; Aaron Timmens).  At DripShip we take our love for t-shirts &amp; customer service and channel it into</span><span> the highest quality clothing we can produce for you</span><span>. We're very proud of our beautiful prints on our quality apparel, but we're even more proud that our company revolves around you.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Who are we currently working with?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Independent Artists</strong><span> - who prefer to create artwork instead of spending their time shipping orders out to their fans.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Small Businesses</strong><span> - who like to spend their time doing what they choose to make money, rather than worrying about managing their t-shirt inventory.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Musicians</strong><span> - who want to use their spare cash for touring the globe instead of paying thousands of dollars on upfront clothing costs.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>And You</strong><span> - even if you're not one of the above three, but you'd like make some money from your own shirt line, we'd love to help you out.</span></p>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><strong>What do we do?</strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>For shirt fans: </strong><span>We give you an outlet where you can purchase hundreds of totally unique shirt designs (on high quality clothing) that were created by businesses, bands and artists all around the world, at one online shop (it's almost ready for you to come by and visit).</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>For our clients:</strong><span> We help you run your own clothing line without requiring thousands of dollars in upfront costs, hassling with managing your inventory, dealing with collecting payments, or spending your personal time shipping out orders. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Every time one of your shirts sell, you'll be making some of the highest profits in the industry, without having to be directly involved in the process </span><span>(Your profits will range between $3 - $10 per shirt sale, depending on what you choose to sell your shirts for)</span><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>To get started, we print your artwork (brand identity, custom designs or fan wear) onto our select &amp; quality apparel. After we print your artwork on the shirt styles you chose, you get to select at least one of our exclusive clothing models to represent and wear your apparel.  And yes, you will then be sent professional quality photographs of your threads, which you can then use to promote your wear however you choose.</span></p>

<h3>Here's one of our models now (say ""hello"" to Jordan):</h3>

<p>Our current printing process (which embeds the ink into the fabric for a super soft feel) is limited to the color of fabric we can print on. So, in order to maintain a <span class=""s1"">consistent </span>quality across the board, we need to upgrade our printing technology...which is one of our core goals: to purchase a printer. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name=""goals"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<h2>Our Reasons &amp; Goals for this indiegogo campaign:</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>#1)</strong><span> To upgrade our printing technology, which will allow us to speed up our printing process, and </span><span>give you more customization options for your designs &amp; overall self-branding. <em><strong>The printer upgrade we're looking at costs around $26,000.00! </strong></em></span><span><br/></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>#2)</strong><span> We need to create a technology tunnel (<em>A.K.A hiring our own developer to do some super geeky stuff</em>) which will allow your products to be listed for sale on any website domain that you choose. </span><span>And, we'll still manage all the payment stuff to make your life easier! ;)</span></p>
<p><strong>#3)</strong> Be able to purchase large quantities of our high end apparel, making every shirt you buy from us the lowest pricing that we can get. This will also allow the printing &amp; shipping process to have a faster turnaround than ever before. And yes, your fans <em>will fall even more in love with your brand,</em> with every single purchase.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Even More Goals:</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If we go over our initial indiegogo goal of $30,000 we’ll be able to do even more. Such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>CLIENTS &amp; FANS: </strong><span>We'll be offering eco-friendly &amp; American-made clothing for those that prefer to only buy clothing that supports american workers and fabric that has been organically processed from start to finish.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>CLIENTS &amp; FANS:</strong><span> We'll be offering dozens more clothing options and colors to choose from. Including different styles of hoodies, sweatshirts, v-necks, long sleeve shirts, a variety of tank tops and more trendy shirt styles to our line-up of shirt options. Not to mention all the latest trends in colors (ie. neon colors, mint, coral, heather fabrics, burnouts and more). </span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>CLIENTS &amp; FANS: </strong><span>Help people in need by putting a shirt on the back of those that need it most: foster kids, individuals in homeless shelters, battered women. Every time one of our client's shirts is purchased, </span><span>we will give a shirt away to someone in need</span><span>.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>CLIENTS &amp; FANS: </strong><span>Setup an international distribution location (potentially in Thailand) in order to </span><span>save big money on shipping costs</span><span>. The average international shipping fee out of the USA is $11 to $12 per shipment. Out of a location like Thailand shipping internationally (almost anywhere in the World) only costs $3 to $5 per shipment!</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>CLIENTS:</strong><span> We'll set up real-time commission stats and notifications for clients that are using us to manage their sales. Specifically, notifications will be sent to you via SMS &amp;/or Email every time your shirt is sold! </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>CLIENTS:</strong> Overall custom branding options like custom clothing labels inside the shirt, custom branding for the outside of the packing going to your customers &amp; custom email notifications sent from your brand/organization.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2>Why should I help fund this campaign?</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Fans: </strong><span>When you help fund our project, you'll not only get exclusive access to our sweet rewards listed to the right, but you'll also help us make our clothing cheaper for you, we'll provide you with more shirt options/styles to choose from and you'll even help to make the overall shipping costs as low as possible (keeping your wallets fatter while wearing clothes that you love)!</span></p>
<p><strong id=""docs-internal-guid-6f13ea09-f5eb-9c62-23c1-26361948e90a""><span>Clients: </span></strong>When you help us reach our goals, you'll have more customization options for your brand/identity and over clothing line, you'll help us make our upfront clothing costs even cheaper (which means you'll sell more shirts than before) and you'll be given an opportunity to pass along the business aspects of printing &amp; shipping your shirts to a company that you can trust...A.K.A DripShip!</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Every single dollar we get from this indiegogo will be used to complete our goals and make our company even more awesome for you.</strong></p>
<p>When we reach $30,000, we'll be able to start the process of upgrading DripShip...BUT, we'd like to surpass our core goal, so that we can help make you more successful and make even bigger changes in this world, thanks to you!<em><br/></em></p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
<h3>Question: What brands of shirts do you use?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> We use only brands &amp; styles of shirts that our team personally tries on and wears multiple times before we allow you to buy them from us. <strong>Some of the high quality brands we carry are: American Apparel, Bella+Canvas &amp; <a href=""http://www.alternativeapparel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Alternative Apparel's Website"">Alternative Apparel</a>.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Question: How do you know the shirt design I want &amp; my size?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> When this campaign is over, we'll be sending out a form that will ask you what shirt graphics you want printed and what size of shirt you'd like. So don't be worried if you contributed and haven't had someone communicate with us! :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Question: How is DripShip different than Zazzle, Café press, Redbubble or Society6?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The first main difference is, <strong>our company revolves around you</strong>...and because of that we have an open channel of communication where we want to hear your thoughts and ideas, even if you think they might be small or insignificant. <br/><br/>The second way we're different is that <strong>we're helping to sell your brand, not ours</strong>. If your brand is ""Joe's Awesome Shirts"", we help you come up with a custom ""Joe's Awesome Shirts"" sales receipt (if you choose to have one for an extra fee), a ""Joe's Awesome Shirts"" online sales page (if you want one for free) and in the future we'll be adding custom packaging options and the ability to have ""Joe's Awesome Shirts"" custom clothing labels printed inside your shirts (this is one of our goals). We do all of this to help you be even more professional than you already are!</p>
<p>The last way we excel above the rest is that <strong>we give you actual profits for your shirt sales</strong>. With most other online shirt shops you may receive $1 to $4 per shirt sale (on the high end) but on our site we give you everything after our basic costs are taken out of the sale. Here's an example: If you sell a basic high quality shirt for $20, our rough fees will be around $10/shirt...so, the rest of that money ($10) goes straight into your pocket! But please remember that our cost changes depending on the quality &amp; style of shirts you choose and how advanced your prints are. :) </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Question: Are the colors of the shirts represented under the reward tiers the only color of shirts I can receive?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. We have dozens of different shirt colors available but in this case we are only using the selected colors you see above...we've teamed up with our designers to make sure your shirts will look as sexy as possible with these shirt color choices we've picked out for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Question: Does everyone that submits a design to you get accepted to have an online store?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For anyone that chooses a reward where that includes their designs to go on our site or amazon.com, then yes. But traditionally (outside of indiegogo) we are very exclusive with who we allow to be our clients. We put a lot of time and energy into helping build our client's brands, so if we we don't think a designer's shirt will sell, we'll give them our feedback and then they'll decide if we're still a good match or not. We're as honest as they come and our team has a good eye for design and shirt styles.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>It has been nearly a solid year since DripShip was first thought of, and it became obvious that indiegogo was the right platform to help boost it into overdrive. indiegogo is not only a way to kick start our business, but it also gives us a chance to properly explain our company and see how the community (you and your friends) will react to what we're offering. We're already helping international businesses &amp; individuals create their own apparel lines, and we're committed to launching more businesses through this campaign.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We are aware of the risks that similar campaigns have faced (delayed shipments, being overwhelmed with communication, etc), and because of that we've worked hard to put all the necessary logistics in place to avoid such occurrences.</span></p>
<p>The fact that we have created a strong relationship with all of the parties involved in this project makes us confident in our ability to fulfill our promises to each and every one of you. All of our partners and vendors know about the campaign and are really excited about how it will help make their businesses even better. We plan to keep an open dialogue with all our backers as well.<em><br/></em></p>

Hello, we're the founders of DripShip (from left to right - Chais Meyer, Shawna Meyer & Aaron Timmens).  At DripShip we take our love for t-shirts & customer service and channel it into the highest quality clothing we can produce for you. We're very proud of our beautiful prints on our quality apparel, but we're even more proud that our company revolves around you.
 
Who are we currently working with?


Independent Artists - who prefer to create artwork instead of spending their time shipping orders out to their fans.


Small Businesses - who like to spend their time doing what they choose to make money, rather than worrying about managing their t-shirt inventory.


Musicians - who want to use their spare cash for touring the globe instead of paying thousands of dollars on upfront clothing costs.


And You - even if you're not one of the above three, but you'd like make some money from your own shirt line, we'd love to help you out.

 
What do we do?
For shirt fans: We give you an outlet where you can purchase hundreds of totally unique shirt designs (on high quality clothing) that were created by businesses, bands and artists all around the world, at one online shop (it's almost ready for you to come by and visit).
For our clients: We help you run your own clothing line without requiring thousands of dollars in upfront costs, hassling with managing your inventory, dealing with collecting payments, or spending your personal time shipping out orders. 
Every time one of your shirts sell, you'll be making some of the highest profits in the industry, without having to be directly involved in the process (Your profits will range between $3 - $10 per shirt sale, depending on what you choose to sell your shirts for).
To get started, we print your artwork (brand identity, custom designs or fan wear) onto our select & quality apparel. After we print your artwork on the shirt styles you chose, you get to select at least one of our exclusive clothing models to represent and wear your apparel.  And yes, you will then be sent professional quality photographs of your threads, which you can then use to promote your wear however you choose.
 
Here's one of our models now (say ""hello"" to Jordan):

 

Our current printing process (which embeds the ink into the fabric for a super soft feel) is limited to the color of fabric we can print on. So, in order to maintain a consistent quality across the board, we need to upgrade our printing technology...which is one of our core goals: to purchase a printer. 
 

Our Reasons & Goals for this indiegogo campaign:
#1) To upgrade our printing technology, which will allow us to speed up our printing process, and give you more customization options for your designs & overall self-branding. The printer upgrade we're looking at costs around $26,000.00! 
#2) We need to create a technology tunnel (A.K.A hiring our own developer to do some super geeky stuff) which will allow your products to be listed for sale on any website domain that you choose. And, we'll still manage all the payment stuff to make your life easier! ;)
#3) Be able to purchase large quantities of our high end apparel, making every shirt you buy from us the lowest pricing that we can get. This will also allow the printing & shipping process to have a faster turnaround than ever before. And yes, your fans will fall even more in love with your brand, with every single purchase.
 
Even More Goals:
If we go over our initial indiegogo goal of $30,000 we’ll be able to do even more. Such as:


CLIENTS & FANS: We'll be offering eco-friendly & American-made clothing for those that prefer to only buy clothing that supports american workers and fabric that has been organically processed from start to finish.


CLIENTS & FANS: We'll be offering dozens more clothing options and colors to choose from. Including different styles of hoodies, sweatshirts, v-necks, long sleeve shirts, a variety of tank tops and more trendy shirt styles to our line-up of shirt options. Not to mention all the latest trends in colors (ie. neon colors, mint, coral, heather fabrics, burnouts and more). 


CLIENTS & FANS: Help people in need by putting a shirt on the back of those that need it most: foster kids, individuals in homeless shelters, battered women. Every time one of our client's shirts is purchased, we will give a shirt away to someone in need.


CLIENTS & FANS: Setup an international distribution location (potentially in Thailand) in order to save big money on shipping costs. The average international shipping fee out of the USA is $11 to $12 per shipment. Out of a location like Thailand shipping internationally (almost anywhere in the World) only costs $3 to $5 per shipment!


CLIENTS: We'll set up real-time commission stats and notifications for clients that are using us to manage their sales. Specifically, notifications will be sent to you via SMS &/or Email every time your shirt is sold! 


CLIENTS: Overall custom branding options like custom clothing labels inside the shirt, custom branding for the outside of the packing going to your customers & custom email notifications sent from your brand/organization.
 
Why should I help fund this campaign?
Fans: When you help fund our project, you'll not only get exclusive access to our sweet rewards listed to the right, but you'll also help us make our clothing cheaper for you, we'll provide you with more shirt options/styles to choose from and you'll even help to make the overall shipping costs as low as possible (keeping your wallets fatter while wearing clothes that you love)!
Clients: When you help us reach our goals, you'll have more customization options for your brand/identity and over clothing line, you'll help us make our upfront clothing costs even cheaper (which means you'll sell more shirts than before) and you'll be given an opportunity to pass along the business aspects of printing & shipping your shirts to a company that you can trust...A.K.A DripShip!
 
 

Every single dollar we get from this indiegogo will be used to complete our goals and make our company even more awesome for you.
When we reach $30,000, we'll be able to start the process of upgrading DripShip...BUT, we'd like to surpass our core goal, so that we can help make you more successful and make even bigger changes in this world, thanks to you!
 
 


Need a visual of our rewards? We don't blame you, we'd want to see what we were getting as a return for our donation as well! 
Note: Not all the reward tiers are represented.  

 


 


 

 

 
 

The majority of our set was made out of cardboard with 1x2’s and 2x4’s acting as support.  

#1) We printed vinyl for decorative elements, such as the deer head you see in the first room, the fireplace, the lamp you see on the desk in the second room, all of the wall ornaments, plus the bar stools.  We attached them to cardboard & cut them out to use them around the set.
#2) We loved the deer head so much that we decided to include it in a couple of our reward tiers at the last minute. It is super cool and we're looking forward to sending it to you when you help fund us!
#3) The founders of DripShip, Chais, Shawna & Aaron constructed the set one week prior to production (with the help of some other awesome people too). It was a joy being hands on with our video and having the opportunity to appreciate all our hard work once it was completed.
#4)The World costume was hand-made out of chicken wire and papier-mâché! Many beers were consumed during the making of this celestial wonder...Can you tell? 

5) All of the people in our video are currently living in, and based out of Kearney, Nebraska (Population: 30,000).  Even though Chais & Shawna lived & worked in Thailand for two years, the business partners agreed that there is something special about Kearney. It's a great place to launch the domestic USA operations of DripShip. And immediately after this campaign is successful, we'll start researching where to launch an international distribution location overseas (to save money on international shipping costs)!
 
 

Frequently Asked Questions:
Question: What brands of shirts do you use?
Answer: We use only brands & styles of shirts that our team personally tries on and wears multiple times before we allow you to buy them from us. Some of the high quality brands we carry are: American Apparel, Bella+Canvas & Alternative Apparel.
 
Question: How do you know the shirt design I want & my size?
Answer: When this campaign is over, we'll be sending out a form that will ask you what shirt graphics you want printed and what size of shirt you'd like. So don't be worried if you contributed and haven't had someone communicate with us! :)
 
Question: How is DripShip different than Zazzle, Café press, Redbubble or Society6?
Answer: The first main difference is, our company revolves around you...and because of that we have an open channel of communication where we want to hear your thoughts and ideas, even if you think they might be small or insignificant. The second way we're different is that we're helping to sell your brand, not ours. If your brand is ""Joe's Awesome Shirts"", we help you come up with a custom ""Joe's Awesome Shirts"" sales receipt (if you choose to have one for an extra fee), a ""Joe's Awesome Shirts"" online sales page (if you want one for free) and in the future we'll be adding custom packaging options and the ability to have ""Joe's Awesome Shirts"" custom clothing labels printed inside your shirts (this is one of our goals). We do all of this to help you be even more professional than you already are!
The last way we excel above the rest is that we give you actual profits for your shirt sales. With most other online shirt shops you may receive $1 to $4 per shirt sale (on the high end) but on our site we give you everything after our basic costs are taken out of the sale. Here's an example: If you sell a basic high quality shirt for $20, our rough fees will be around $10/shirt...so, the rest of that money ($10) goes straight into your pocket! But please remember that our cost changes depending on the quality & style of shirts you choose and how advanced your prints are. :) 
 
Question: Are the colors of the shirts represented under the reward tiers the only color of shirts I can receive?
Answer: Yes. We have dozens of different shirt colors available but in this case we are only using the selected colors you see above...we've teamed up with our designers to make sure your shirts will look as sexy as possible with these shirt color choices we've picked out for you.
 
Question: Does everyone that submits a design to you get accepted to have an online store?
Answer: For anyone that chooses a reward where that includes their designs to go on our site or amazon.com, then yes. But traditionally (outside of indiegogo) we are very exclusive with who we allow to be our clients. We put a lot of time and energy into helping build our client's brands, so if we we don't think a designer's shirt will sell, we'll give them our feedback and then they'll decide if we're still a good match or not. We're as honest as they come and our team has a good eye for design and shirt styles.
 
 

It has been nearly a solid year since DripShip was first thought of, and it became obvious that indiegogo was the right platform to help boost it into overdrive. indiegogo is not only a way to kick start our business, but it also gives us a chance to properly explain our company and see how the community (you and your friends) will react to what we're offering. We're already helping international businesses & individuals create their own apparel lines, and we're committed to launching more businesses through this campaign.
We are aware of the risks that similar campaigns have faced (delayed shipments, being overwhelmed with communication, etc), and because of that we've worked hard to put all the necessary logistics in place to avoid such occurrences.
The fact that we have created a strong relationship with all of the parties involved in this project makes us confident in our ability to fulfill our promises to each and every one of you. All of our partners and vendors know about the campaign and are really excited about how it will help make their businesses even better. We plan to keep an open dialogue with all our backers as well.

A big kudos also goes out to the many people who collectively made this video possible.  You are all fabulous people and great to work with!
...and to you indiegogo & DripShip fans.  We greatly appreciate you donating.  You're helping to make a huge difference to the company and team of DripShip.net! Thanks a million!

<div><strong>the idea:</strong></div>
<div>The idea is very simple.</div>
<div>To invent a sport shoe able to fit in every size and grows with the foot. Resistant and durable.</div>
<div>Very cheap, easy to fabricate and free for everybody who needs.</div>
<div>We want to take advantage of the technology, the new materials and the ultimate fabrication systems without forgetting the traditional ones.</div>

<p>Se trata de una idea muy simple.</p>
<p>Inventar unas zapatillas capaces de adaptarse a cualquier talla y crecer con el pie de quien las usa. Resistentes y duraderas. Muy baratas, sencillas de fabricar y accesibles de manera gratuita a todo aquel que las necesite.</p>
<p>Queremos aprovechar los avances de la tecnología, los nuevos materiales y los nuevos sistemas de fabricación pero sin olvidarnos de los métodos artesanales.</p>
<p>Queremos sacar partido de los nuevos modos de comunicación, financiación y colaboración entre personas y así poder diseñar, financiar, fabricar (o mejor que fabriquen las industrias locales) zapatillas gratuitas para el tercer mundo.</p>

<div> </div>
<p>                </p>
<p><strong>¿Por qué apoyar esta iniciativa?</strong></p>
<p>Existen muchas iniciativas sociales para ayudar al tercer mundo mediante la donación de lo que en occidente ya no queremos (lo que ya no usamos o consideramos caducado); medicamentos, alimentos, ropa, juguetes, libros, incluso calzado.</p>
<p>Existen otras iniciativas de donación de calzado basadas en regalar un par de zapatos nuevos por cada par de zapatos vendido en occidente.</p>
<p>Regalar en África zapatos fabricados en China termina por destruir las pocas industrias locales del calzado y un bienintencionado gesto acaba causando un daño impredecible.</p>
<p>Todas ellas son buenas iniciativas pero fundamentadas en una visión errónea del término “compartir”.</p>
<p>Compartir las sobras no es compartir, regalar sin medir las consecuencias es una imprudencia…. pero al menos ambas cosas son mejor que nada.</p>
<p>Esta idea busca ayudar y calzar a todos los desfavorecidos, niños y adultos, y permitirles estrenar dignamente sus zapatillas (diseñadas y financiadas en occidente pero fabricadas en el tercer mundo y para el tercer mundo).</p>
<p>Un gesto de respeto y solidaridad en que cada uno podrá ayudar como crea o pueda.</p>
<p>Esta iniciativa no pretende despertar malas conciencias ni sentimientos de culpa, solo ayudar a quien lo necesita desde la perspectiva de dos personas normales, con sus virtudes y sus defectos.  </p>
<p><em>Disfrutemos de la vida y con ella disfrutemos de nuestros caprichos,</em> pero hagámoslo sin olvidarnos de quien no tiene. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why help this initiative:</strong></p>
<p>There are many social initiatives to help the third world by donating the waste and what nobody wants (second hand or out of date goods); medicines, food, clothes, toys, books and shoes too.</p>
<p>There are another initiatives about donating new shoes following the ""BOGO"" model of buy one and gift one to the third world. To gift in Africa shoes made in China destroys the fragile local industries and a well-intentioned act became in an impredictable damage.</p>
<p>All are good initiatives but founded in a wrong meaning of ""sharing"". To share the leftovers is not share, to gift without measuring the consequences is a imprudence... but at lest both thing are better than nothing.   </p>
<div>Our Idea looks for the best way to help and gift shoes to children and adults and let they wear with dignity a brand new pair of sneakers (designed and financed in the western world but fabricated in the third world for the third world).</div>
<div>A solidary and respect gesture where everyone would help somehow. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We don't want to awake any bad feelings, just help the people who need it from the perspective of the common people, with virtues and defects. </div>
<div>Let's enjoy life and let's enjoy our little pleasures but let's do it taking care of the have-nots.</div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Los pasos para completar el proyecto:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1er paso:</strong></p>
<p>El primer paso del proyecto es lanzar un concurso internacional de ideas.</p>
<p>Será un concurso sin premio ni ganador en que se seleccionarán las mejores ideas para tratar de crear un prototipo que nos permita avanzar hasta el segundo paso.</p>
<p>Serán bienvenidas todas las ideas, ya sean escritas, dibujadas, fotografiadas... Ideas sobre las zapatillas en su totalidad o simplemente sobre un pequeño detalle.</p>
<p>Diseñadores, arquitectos, estudiantes, escuelas de diseño, ingenieros, o cualquier persona que tenga una idea y quiera compartirla podrá enviárnoslas a la dirección de correo electrónico de contacto.</p>
<p>Publicaremos en la web y en nuestra página de Facebook todas las ideas aportadas y los nombres de todos aquellos que deseen constar como colaboradores o sponsors.</p>
<p>Los derechos sobre la idea o ideas que conformarán el prototipo siempre pertenecerán a quien las envíe y nosotros solamente actuaremos como un mero canal para conseguir que se fabrique.</p>
<p>En este primer paso necesitamos vuestra ayuda de la siguiente forma:</p>
<ol>
<li>-<em>Enviando ideas y diseños originales para las zapatillas del tercer mundo.</em>
</li>
<li>-Mediante a<em>portaciones económicas a través de las diferentes plataformas de crowdfunding de nuestro proyecto, que servirán para publicitar el concurso y financiar la fabricación de los prototipos necesarios.</em>
</li>
<li>-<em>Ayudando a fabricar los prototipos en tu taller, tu fábrica, o con los medios que tengas.</em>
</li>
<li>-<em>Difundiendo y fomentando esta iniciativa para que vuestro entorno personal y laboral se involucre.</em> </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<div><strong>The steps to complete the project.</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><span><strong>1st Step:</strong></span></div>
<div>
<div><span>The first step is about launch an international tender of ideas.</span></div>
<div><span>A tender without prize and without winner where we will select the best ideas in order to create a prototype that allows us reach the next step.</span></div>
<div><span>All types of ideas will be welcome. Whiten, sketched, photographed.... Ideas about the complete sneakers or just a single detail. </span></div>

</div></div>","the idea:
The idea is very simple.
To invent a sport shoe able to fit in every size and grows with the foot. Resistant and durable.
Very cheap, easy to fabricate and free for everybody who needs.
We want to take advantage of the technology, the new materials and the ultimate fabrication systems without forgetting the traditional ones.
We want to use the new ways of communicating, financing and collaboration between people and then finance and fabricate (or much better fabricate with the local industries) free sneakers for the third world.
Helping with shoes, helping with jobs. 
Let's make an effort (creative, economical and personal) to try to make the life of the disadvantaged a bit better.

There are 1 billion of children in the  world living in poverty and around  300 million of these  children lack a pair of adequate shoes.


http://www.unicef.org/sowc05/english/childhoodunderthreat.html

Diseases directly related with the lack of shoes as Podoconiosis (AKA Mossy foot) and soil parasites affects every year to 740 millions of people. This situation stigmatizes and reduces the affected possibilities of having a decent future with a decent job or attending to school.
http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/podoconiosis/en/

 
La idea:
Se trata de una idea muy simple.
Inventar unas zapatillas capaces de adaptarse a cualquier talla y crecer con el pie de quien las usa. Resistentes y duraderas. Muy baratas, sencillas de fabricar y accesibles de manera gratuita a todo aquel que las necesite.
Queremos aprovechar los avances de la tecnología, los nuevos materiales y los nuevos sistemas de fabricación pero sin olvidarnos de los métodos artesanales.
Queremos sacar partido de los nuevos modos de comunicación, financiación y colaboración entre personas y así poder diseñar, financiar, fabricar (o mejor que fabriquen las industrias locales) zapatillas gratuitas para el tercer mundo.
Ayudar dando zapatos y ayudar dando trabajo.
Hacer un esfuerzo (creativo, económico y personal) para tratar de hacer la vida de los desfavorecidos un poco mejor.
De los mil millones de niños del mundo que viven en la extrema pobreza se estima que aproximadamente 300 millones de ellos no tienen acceso a un par de zapatos.http://www.unicef.org/sowc05/english/childhoodunderthreat.html
Enfermedades directamente relacionadas con la carencia de calzado, como la Podoconiosis o los parásitos del suelo afectan anualmente a 740 millones de personas. Estas enfermedades imposibilitan que el individuo pueda desarrollar una vida digna. Sin trabajo, sin escolarización y sufriendo una enfermedad considerada una lacra social sus opciones de futuro apenas existen.
http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/podoconiosis/en/
 
                
¿Por qué apoyar esta iniciativa?
Existen muchas iniciativas sociales para ayudar al tercer mundo mediante la donación de lo que en occidente ya no queremos (lo que ya no usamos o consideramos caducado); medicamentos, alimentos, ropa, juguetes, libros, incluso calzado.
Existen otras iniciativas de donación de calzado basadas en regalar un par de zapatos nuevos por cada par de zapatos vendido en occidente.
Regalar en África zapatos fabricados en China termina por destruir las pocas industrias locales del calzado y un bienintencionado gesto acaba causando un daño impredecible.
Todas ellas son buenas iniciativas pero fundamentadas en una visión errónea del término “compartir”.
Compartir las sobras no es compartir, regalar sin medir las consecuencias es una imprudencia…. pero al menos ambas cosas son mejor que nada.
Esta idea busca ayudar y calzar a todos los desfavorecidos, niños y adultos, y permitirles estrenar dignamente sus zapatillas (diseñadas y financiadas en occidente pero fabricadas en el tercer mundo y para el tercer mundo).
Un gesto de respeto y solidaridad en que cada uno podrá ayudar como crea o pueda.
Esta iniciativa no pretende despertar malas conciencias ni sentimientos de culpa, solo ayudar a quien lo necesita desde la perspectiva de dos personas normales, con sus virtudes y sus defectos.  
Disfrutemos de la vida y con ella disfrutemos de nuestros caprichos, pero hagámoslo sin olvidarnos de quien no tiene. 
 
Why help this initiative:
There are many social initiatives to help the third world by donating the waste and what nobody wants (second hand or out of date goods); medicines, food, clothes, toys, books and shoes too.
There are another initiatives about donating new shoes following the ""BOGO"" model of buy one and gift one to the third world. To gift in Africa shoes made in China destroys the fragile local industries and a well-intentioned act became in an impredictable damage.
All are good initiatives but founded in a wrong meaning of ""sharing"". To share the leftovers is not share, to gift without measuring the consequences is a imprudence... but at lest both thing are better than nothing.   
Our Idea looks for the best way to help and gift shoes to children and adults and let they wear with dignity a brand new pair of sneakers (designed and financed in the western world but fabricated in the third world for the third world).
A solidary and respect gesture where everyone would help somehow. 
 
We don't want to awake any bad feelings, just help the people who need it from the perspective of the common people, with virtues and defects. 
Let's enjoy life and let's enjoy our little pleasures but let's do it taking care of the have-nots.
 
Los pasos para completar el proyecto:
1er paso:
El primer paso del proyecto es lanzar un concurso internacional de ideas.
Será un concurso sin premio ni ganador en que se seleccionarán las mejores ideas para tratar de crear un prototipo que nos permita avanzar hasta el segundo paso.
Serán bienvenidas todas las ideas, ya sean escritas, dibujadas, fotografiadas... Ideas sobre las zapatillas en su totalidad o simplemente sobre un pequeño detalle.
Diseñadores, arquitectos, estudiantes, escuelas de diseño, ingenieros, o cualquier persona que tenga una idea y quiera compartirla podrá enviárnoslas a la dirección de correo electrónico de contacto.
Publicaremos en la web y en nuestra página de Facebook todas las ideas aportadas y los nombres de todos aquellos que deseen constar como colaboradores o sponsors.
Los derechos sobre la idea o ideas que conformarán el prototipo siempre pertenecerán a quien las envíe y nosotros solamente actuaremos como un mero canal para conseguir que se fabrique.
En este primer paso necesitamos vuestra ayuda de la siguiente forma:

-Enviando ideas y diseños originales para las zapatillas del tercer mundo.

-Mediante aportaciones económicas a través de las diferentes plataformas de crowdfunding de nuestro proyecto, que servirán para publicitar el concurso y financiar la fabricación de los prototipos necesarios.

-Ayudando a fabricar los prototipos en tu taller, tu fábrica, o con los medios que tengas.

-Difundiendo y fomentando esta iniciativa para que vuestro entorno personal y laboral se involucre. 

 
The steps to complete the project.
 
1st Step:

The first step is about launch an international tender of ideas.
A tender without prize and without winner where we will select the best ideas in order to create a prototype that allows us reach the next step.
All types of ideas will be welcome. Whiten, sketched, photographed.... Ideas about the complete sneakers or just a single detail. 
Designers, architects, students, schools of design, engineers or any person with a good idea can share it with us in our contact email address.
We will publish in our web page and in our facebook profile all the shared ideas and the name of everyone who desire to appear as contributor or sponsor.
The ownership of the conforming ideas of the prototype will belong always to the original author and we will act just as intermediaries to coordinate the engineering and fabrication.
In this first step we will need your help in this way:

Sharing you ideas for the third world sneakers with us.
Financing our project through the different crowd-funding platforms where our project is. With this money we will promote and advertise our tender and pay the expenses of fabricate the prototypes.
Helping us fabricating the prototypes in your factory, warehouse or with your resources.
Expanding our initiative by making your work colleges and family know about and get into it. Let's make a lot of noise. 


 
2º Paso:
Una vez se tengan los primeros prototipos comenzaremos a trazar el plan de viabilidad de la fabricación y distribución masiva de las zapatillas.
Dependiendo de las vías de financiación y crecimiento de la iniciativa seleccionaremos los países, poblaciones e industrias con las que establecer los acuerdos de desarrollo basándonos en criterios de honestidad y fiabilidad.
Cuidaremos especialmente evitar un crecimiento industrial desestabilizador que pueda propiciar el enriquecimiento ilícito de las autoridades o las industrias. Se trata de crecer mediante la propagación de pequeñas fábricas de carácter local en diferentes países capaces de abastecer la demanda de la región.
Buscaremos grandes fabricantes dispuestos a ayudar aportando maquinaria o financiación para equipar a las pequeñas industrias locales. También el apoyo de profesionales del sector y de la artesanía dispuestos a enseñar los métodos de fabricación adecuados para optimizar los costes de nuestras zapatillas.
En esta fase del proyecto necesitaremos toda la difusión posible en medios de comunicación. Revistas de moda, tendencias o actualidad; periódicos, radio y televisión. Cuanto mayor eco se hagan los medios más facil resultará conseguir nuestras metas.
En este segundo paso necesitamos vuestra ayuda de la siguiente manera:

-Si eres una gran marca o fabricante y quieres ayudar financiando o equipando a una pequeña industria local.
-Si eres una gran marca o fabricante y quieres asumir la plena financiación del proyecto.
-Enseñando a las industrias locales cómo fabricar y sacar partido a la nueva maquinaria.
-Mediante pequeñas aportaciones que nos permitan comprar y equipar a las industrias locales.
-Colaborando como consultor legal para llegar a los acuerdos adecuados con cada participante.
-Donando materias primas: tejidos, plásticos, derivados reciclados o componentes para la zapatilla. 
Publicitando la iniciativa en medios de comunicación.

 

2nd Step:
In the moment that we have the first prototypes we will start tracing the viability plan of the mass fabrication and distribution of the sneakers.
Depending of the support obtained, the magnitude of our different sponsors and growing capacity we will select the countries, populations and industries to establish our development agreements, always focused in the honesty and reliability criteria.

We will take special care of avoid any destabilizer industrial growing that can generate the illicit enrichment of the authorities or industries. It's about growing but by spreading small local factories in different countries with capacity for the regional necessities.
We will try to make the big shoe brands get into our initiative by giving us machines and tools or money to create or equip small local factories. At the same time we will look for support from the shoe industry professionals or artisans  with the will of teaching the adequate methods of fabrication to optimize the production cost of our sneakers. 
In this second step we will need all the possible diffusion in the mass media. TV, radio, newspapers, magazines. As loud as we can make our voice closer will be our goal.  
In this second step we need you help in this way:

If you are a mayor brand of shoes or manufacturer and you want to finance or equip a local industry. 
If you are a mayor brand of shoes and you want to be our main sponsor by financing a big part of the project.
Teaching the local industries how to fabricate and squeeze new machines and tools.
By small economical donations letting us buy used machines and tools to equip local industries.
Helping us as legal consultant to close all the adequate deals with all the parties.
Donating material, textiles, plastics, recycled materials or components for the sneakers.

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Parable</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We are two high school students from NYC determined to establish our own clothing company, with your help that is. We are beginning the company through our school as part of the Senior Project program available to seniors. As a part of the project we get two weeks off in May (the 13th through 28th) to hound away at our goal 24/7. For us, this company does not stop once we graduate and our Senior Project period is over. We are not two students who want to sell some tees to our friends. We are ambitious in the goal and scope of our Senior Project because we want this to be a legitimate fully functioning business that we can continue for years to come.With your help we are positive that we can achieve our goal. Thanks.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The proposal required to be admitted into the Senior Project program at our school that outlines our entire two weeks off as well as the company plan is below. Our estimated expenses (what your help is going towards) is also listed below:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Proposal:</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Abstract:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Parable will be a fully developed clothing company out of New York City. Created and designed by my partner (Devon Kasarjian) and I, it reflects the style of clothing that we would desire to wear and feel comfortable in. Clothing/textile design will be researched at such locations as the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Library along with learning and utilizing screen/silk-screen printing methods. Manufacturers will be contacted and factories visited in order to obtain shirts to be used. The goal is to make this brand fully functional and legitimate by establishing a presence. Clothing will be able to be manufactured, ordered, and bought. We want to completely begin a brand at the ground floor with only up to go. Our intended outcome is to develop not only the designs to be printed on our clothing, manufacture clothing, screenprint said designs, but also establish a business plan, online presence and marketing campaign.</span></p>
<h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Rationale:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This project serves as real world work experience in a field of great interest as well as to teach independence. Independence and professionalism in an area of interest is a trait that has been prevalent throughout my life-long education at Friends Seminary (where we attend). As students we have always been inspired to experience and investigate what interests us. I also feel that by extension we learn how to become better members of communities whether local or on a global scale through experience. We are a community of learners and what better way then learn from experience. I want this project to serve as inspiration but also to promote dialogue. I want others to reflect and discuss not only the physical project but also the capabilities of high school students.</span></p>
<h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Responsibilities and Schedule:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Because I want to establish a brand for my Senior Project there are numerous tasks and factors to be taken into account (which makes it rather ambitious) to be completed before the two weeks and during as well.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Before May 13 the designs and business plan will need to be finalized with very small alterations to be made. A company or manufacturer will need to have been selected based upon the desired material, quantity etc. A clothing printing studio will need to be found in order to learn to print as well as consult with. I have been in contact with the manager at Works in Progress on the Lower East Side. The appropriate funds for this project will need to be raised as well. We also understand that cost, though we have already started raising, can be a limiting factor which might alter the intended outcome.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>During the two weeks (13 - 28), learning the screenprinting/silkscreening method will be achieved through taking classes and participating in open studio events at a printing studio. Also, the clothing will need to be ordered and printed during this time. Since our business plan and intended outcome includes a marketing plan, we plan on designing stickers, developing a photographic and video lookbook in addition to a website and email. We have already contacted people to model our clothing as well as shoot the lookbook at a location, which needs to be found.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The first week will be dedicated to working with screens and the materials that were purchased prior in order to become independent in the silk screening method. This will be done by taking a seminar at a print shop as well as time with consultants as to how best to print our designs. Time will then be spent during the days at the shop in their workspace during allotted times to practice and perform the methods. The physical clothing will have had to be ordered befor this first week in order to do said printing. Designs will also be finalized during this period and scheduling for the following week established as well. The website will be started and the stickers ordered.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Following, the second week will be a busy push period in which the lookbook will be shot and edited. Locations will have been researched and found prior to the shoot. The model has already been contacted and has agreed to participate. This video and photographic lookbook will be put up on the website. Everything will be finalized, organized, and prepared for presentation.</span></p>
<h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It must be restated that due to the sheer scale of this project and because of the cost component (though a business plan is essential) may alter the intended outcome. In the allotted time it may not be possible to complete the full marketing plan. In addition, based upon cost and budget estimates the quantity of shirts and amount able to be printed will be evaluated. I have the utmost intention of completing every single aspect I have outlined, though I completely understand there are certain factors that may be out of my control.</span></p>
<h3><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Experiential Component:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Since the intention of this project is to fully establish a brand and clothing company, built from the ground up, the project is heavily reliant on and involved actively in the field. This project is work experience and experience in what it takes to start a company. Design will be researched at design libraries such as the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Library as well as Parsons. Factories and manufactures will be located and visited in order to get price estimates as well as the required clothing that suits our standards. Also, clothing printing methods will be learned, practiced and implemented at print workshops such as Works in Progress or 3rd Ward. A presence will then be developed online and through social media. Also, meetings with advisors, both of which have extensive work experience and knowledge of the process, will be arranged and held. All of these experiences present different aspects of the business and field that is trying to be broken into during the course of this project. I see myself on foot roaming the city for the best places to print and manufacture clothes, really reveling in my entrepreneurship and really appreciating the effort and time it takes to create clothing.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>In both of these publications, timeless and influential designer Paul Rand shares his words &amp; thoughts on varied topics ranging from design philosophy to design education. Being not only a designer but philosopher, his work conveys an expression of beauty, innovation, sensibility, and himself on a personal level. He is a design legend with much to learn from. What he is able to do is display graphically designs that conveys his own nature and the nature of his clients and viewers. This is essentially the main goal of this senior project above all else. We want to develop clothing that reflects our nature and the nature of the wearers through the designs we place upon the garments. These books are verbal statements of the theories as to how to best achieve this goal.</span></p>

The physical clothing will have had to be ordered befor this first week in order to do said printing. Designs will also be finalized during this period and scheduling for the following week established as well. The website will be started and the stickers ordered.
Following, the second week will be a busy push period in which the lookbook will be shot and edited. Locations will have been researched and found prior to the shoot. The model has already been contacted and has agreed to participate. This video and photographic lookbook will be put up on the website. Everything will be finalized, organized, and prepared for presentation.
 
It must be restated that due to the sheer scale of this project and because of the cost component (though a business plan is essential) may alter the intended outcome. In the allotted time it may not be possible to complete the full marketing plan. In addition, based upon cost and budget estimates the quantity of shirts and amount able to be printed will be evaluated. I have the utmost intention of completing every single aspect I have outlined, though I completely understand there are certain factors that may be out of my control.
 
Experiential Component:
Since the intention of this project is to fully establish a brand and clothing company, built from the ground up, the project is heavily reliant on and involved actively in the field. This project is work experience and experience in what it takes to start a company. Design will be researched at design libraries such as the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Library as well as Parsons. Factories and manufactures will be located and visited in order to get price estimates as well as the required clothing that suits our standards. Also, clothing printing methods will be learned, practiced and implemented at print workshops such as Works in Progress or 3rd Ward. A presence will then be developed online and through social media. Also, meetings with advisors, both of which have extensive work experience and knowledge of the process, will be arranged and held. All of these experiences present different aspects of the business and field that is trying to be broken into during the course of this project. I see myself on foot roaming the city for the best places to print and manufacture clothes, really reveling in my entrepreneurship and really appreciating the effort and time it takes to create clothing.
 
Supplemental Book:
Paul Rand: Conversations with Students
Kroeger, Michael. Paul Rand: Conversations with Students. N.p.: Princeton Architectural, 2008. Print.
Paul Rand: A Designer’s Art
Rand, Paul. Paul Rand: A Designer's Art. New Haven: Yale UP, 1985. Print.
 
In both of these publications, timeless and influential designer Paul Rand shares his words & thoughts on varied topics ranging from design philosophy to design education. Being not only a designer but philosopher, his work conveys an expression of beauty, innovation, sensibility, and himself on a personal level. He is a design legend with much to learn from. What he is able to do is display graphically designs that conveys his own nature and the nature of his clients and viewers. This is essentially the main goal of this senior project above all else. We want to develop clothing that reflects our nature and the nature of the wearers through the designs we place upon the garments. These books are verbal statements of the theories as to how to best achieve this goal.

Eighteen months of hard work and dozens of prototypes, we are very excited to share our new campaign with you. The Moose Designs backpack is a professionally made stylish, versatile, rugged and innovatively designed bag for everyone.  
 
  
 
 
Both Grey and Black fabrics are water resistant and very durable. Only grey fabric is cut resistant.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We spent 18 months, redesigning a backpack with the feedback of our backers. We read every single comments, reviews, suggestions and blogs about the common needs of a backpack so we could design a backpack that is for everyone from professionals, adventurers, photographers, travelers, commuters to students! 
 
 
 
 Vegan Leather:We use extra durable Microfiber Leather which is as durable as real leather and does not peel out. 
 
 
 The back part of the backpack takes the features of private workstation mode. Sturdy and strong flaps fold out to create the ultimate on the go laptop station; a private workspace anywhere with over 15 dedicated pockets,elastic straps in and out, touch screen phone pocket, built-in USB port,extendable & protected laptop sleeve, water-resistant zippers and cut-resistant fabrics,  the list goes on with its functionalities.  Ohh also, this bag turns heads every time so get ready to answer curious questions wherever you set it up! Laptop compartment size is 16""x11""- Fits up to 15.6"" Laptops- Stretchable Sleeve 
 Workstation Mode On The GoYou can use your laptop on the Moose Workstation bag without unfolding the side walls. When you need the side walls in a limited space on the go, simply unfold and snap the side walls so that keeps the bag on its position to create your own workspace anywhere.     
 
Create your own workspace anywhere!
 
 
 Laptop compartment size is 16""x11""- Fits all the 15.6"" Laptops & some 17"" Laptops- Stretchable Sleeve 
 
 
Charge your phone on the go
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Moose Backpack provides instant access from all sides. When you need to reach your stuff fast, you don't have to unzip the bag all the way. Quick access design allows you to reach your laptop on the backside and books on the front side in seconds!A retractable key fob is included in Moose backpack, that is attached to the bag meaning you don’t have to hunt for your keys. 
 
 
 The large front pocket on the backpack is one of the most practical features of the backpack. The pocket is large enough to carry even large books or enough clothes for weekend trips and because it opens fully, you do not have to hunt in the pocket to find things. The inside of the bag has been designed to carry as much as you could possibly need in easy to access pockets. Special pockets for RFID documents and passports have been built in, again with super easy access. Every pocket has been designed and positioned with your convenience and ease of access in mind keeping you clutter-free on the move.  
 
 Inside the large front compartment is a handy holdall that can be used to carry sunglasses, tech items or act as a very stylish pencil case or toiletry bag.The pouch has three different water-resistant compartments that attaches inside the bag with strong velcro. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Innovative extension system inside the main compartment helps you pack even more!The Moose backpack's add-on camera cube keeps your equipment safe. For extra durability, we inserted double foam side walls which are shock resistant and a PP protection board inside the camera cube.   
 
Please add an additional $50 per camera cube to your pledge level.  
 
 
 
 Because the backpack has been built around travelers its size is made to measure for airline personal item bag size. This means you can always carry everything with you and your portable work space goes with you. The Moose bag makes a great carry-on bag for short trips. It looks slim but fits a lot of items!

 The straps of the backpack have been ergonomically designed for ease and comfort of transport, whether you are walking, scooting or riding the adjustable straps make carrying the backpack a pleasure knowing you and your baggage are safe and secure. 
Chest strap is easily removable from the backpack straps when you don't need it.
 
 Patent-pending, Moose Designs bag will adapt to your everyday lifestyle with its cleverly located different types of pockets and stylish design.

<p>Hi, I’m Tayson. I started Outdoor Vitals to help outdoor enthusiasts “Live Ultralight” through the use of premium ultralight products that cut down on waste. My team and I believe Living Ultralight means using premium gear that works in any weather, is easy to pack, and won’t slow you down. It means buying less quantity to fill up our earth’s landfills and buying more quality products that are ready for all your adventures.</p>
<p>I knew that premium gear was inherently lighter, lasted longer, and provided better outdoor experiences. However, the price of the gear was out of reach for me and my family. I wanted outdoor adventurers to spend less on gear and more on experiences.</p>
<p>That’s why I designed Outdoor Vitals to sell directly to consumers and cut out middlemen retailers that markup prices sometimes by double. With this business model, we’ve been able to get quality products out to you for 40-50% less than a retail store.</p>
<p>I also recognize that I’m very fortunate to be where I am, while others around the world are not as fortunate. So Outdoor Vitals donates 1% of our revenue to sustainable poverty projects around the world.<br/><br/>This will be our 3rd crowdfunding campaign. Our last campaign raised over $750,000 on Kickstarter and continued to hit over $1,000,000 on Indiegogo!</p>
<p>When we started, we only had $500 to put into the company — and we never took venture capital. We determined that a family-owned company is better at creating value for customers. While the company has grown to be a 9 figure brand, it's still extremely vital to our growth that we use crowdfunding platforms to help us compete with investment company-owned or venture capital-backed outdoor brands. We believe that focusing on long term value for our customers is more important than reporting to investors about how to maximize the next month’s profits.</p>
<p>The Outdoor Vitals team is made up of passionate outdoor enthusiasts that understand the demands and needs of outdoor attire and accessories. We constantly push the envelope by finding the latest and most innovative materials to build our products, and the Satu Pants are our biggest innovation yet!</p>
<p><strong>Join us and start Living Ultralight today!</strong></p>

Not only that, but they are built to be at home and everywhere you go! Feel more comfortable at the office, on the trail, or in a foreign country!
The Satu Adventure Pants were built for ultra-comfort, incredible durability, and maximum performance — complete with a stylish design. Best of all, they’re backed with a lifetime guarantee. 
The Satu Adventure Pants are super comfortable while looking good and providing top performance. They’re even backed with a Lifetime Guarantee. 
 

Our products use quality materials, leading-edge manufacturing, fair employment practices, and innovative designs ensuring you get a superior product. We’re a direct-to-consumer business, so we’re able to cut out the middleman and pass the savings to you.Since raising over a million dollars with our LoftTek Adventure jacket, you (our community) have been telling us to do more. So we’re back to bring you our next game-changing piece of gear!
One major problem we found was with our current pant options was that we had pants for everything, but nothing as performance-focused and versatile as the LoftTek Jacket.We started with researching the perfect fabric and ended up partnering with Toray, a world leader in fabric innovation and quality.
Together, we developed a pair of pants that are powerfully functional, extremely comfortable, and exceptionally good looking in every situation.
 

The Satu Adventure Pants use Toray’s Japanese-designed mechanical stretch fabric. The proprietary weave and fabric construction makes them incredibly lightweight, flexible, strong, comfortable and remarkably fast drying.
Since the proprietary weave gives more than enough stretch to the fabric, we were able to construct Satu without heavy, slow-drying spandex. 
Spandex is heavy and loves to hold on to moisture, such as sweat. This means it takes forever to dry, gets heavier overtime, and builds up smells faster. Ever wonder why your gym clothes smell so bad? Now you know.
Satu’s Japanese mechanical stretch fabric is stretchier, lighter, stronger, and faster drying than spandex. It is an overall more advanced fabric — making it perfect for the Satu Adventure Pants. 

The Satu Pants are extremely lightweight — making them super comfortable and perfect for travel.
The Japanese Stretch Fabric is highly stretchable, giving you full freedom and mobility in absolute comfort.
A gusseted crotch gives you extra room where it matters. Stop restricting yourself and be free.
Keep the Satu Pants snug and comfortable without needing a belt. 
The proprietary fabric weave and lack of spandex make these dry significantly faster than other pants.  

Satu’s naturally odor-resistant fabric is treated with an additional medical-grade MAKSPEC antibacterial weave — ensuring they stay fresh super long, no matter what. 
No worries over spills or stains, the DWR Coating makes the Satu Pants water and stain-resistant.
Leave your gaiters at home! A removable lace clip and adjustable hem keeps your pants clipped in and snow/dirt out.
That’s right! We are so confident in the build quality that we guarantee it for a lifetime! Wear them everyday, everywhere, through anything — you won’t be disappointed. We guarantee it. 

Carry all your essentials without anyone noticing and while keeping a slim profile. Perfect for notebooks, passports, and more!
Tighten the pants when riding a bike, raise it for water crossings, or secure it around your boot to keep dirt and snow out!
Quickly cool down and air out. When closed, the vents lay flush with the seams — staying completely hidden.
When you need to go to the office or a date, belt loops let you add a belt and transform to a cleaner, more formal look. 
 
We didn’t stop with the Satu Pants. We created a complete lower body system built for adventure and warmth. Our specially designed thermals and underwear completes the entire adventure set to give you unparalleled performance with sleek design.
We used NuYarn DragonWool™ for all our accessories. DragonWool™ uses a patented process that strengthens and maximizes Merino wool’s potential without damaging it.
Enjoy the same ultra-softness, heat regulation, odor resistance, and moisture wicking ability of Merino wool heightened by the smooth, advanced, lightweight DragonWool™ weave. 

NuYarn DragonWool™
¾ Length
Reduced Bunching & Rubbing
Full-Length Quick Release
50% Stronger Burst Strength
35% More Loft & Warmth
Abrasion & Tear Resistant
Stronger Flatlock
Seams with 0% Overlap

Our thermals feature a ¾ length to prevent bunching with your socks. Get powerful warmth without the discomfort.
Full-length quick release zippers let you put on and take off the thermals without removing your boots!
The combination of merino wool’s natural properties and DragonWool™’s proprietary weave makes our thermals exceptionally effective at heat regulation. Stay warm when it’s cold and stay cool when it’s warm.
DragonWool™ is extremely fast drying allowing you to stay comfortable even when mother nature is throwing her best at you or you are highly active. The wool against your skin keeps you warm while the quick-drying polyester dissipates the moisture! 
Our thermals use a unique sew that keeps the seams flat and strong with zero overlap. This ensures you stay comfortable and prevents any unwanted abrasion on your skin. 

NuYarn DragonWool™
Reduced Bunching and Rubbing
50% Stronger Burst Strength
Abrasion & Tear Resistant
Quick-Drying
Optimal Heat Regulation
Designs for Men and Women
50% Stronger Burst & Fewer Holes

We made our boxers longer than typical boxers. The extra length keeps the boxers in place so they don’t bunch up or form uncomfortable wedgies — no more riding up!
The Merino wool used in DragonWool™ is naturally moisture-wicking, while the weave makes the fabric super quick-drying. This combination means sweat and moisture are quickly wicked and dissipated, so you always stay dry and odor-free.
Merino wool is already super soft. When combined with the DragonWool™ weave, the fabric suddenly becomes smooth as silk. You’ve never had underwear this smooth or lightweight.
We have boxer designs for both him and her — so everyone can enjoy the smooth, soft, lightweight comfort of our DragonWool™ boxers.

Not only is the DragonWool hoodie great at heat regulation, but it’s also powerfully breathable. As you get more active throughout the day, the hoodie lets air circulate through and can be worn as an outer layer to help you cool down without worry.
No more cold butts! The DragonWool hoodie features a dropped back to keep your bottoms warm even when you sit. It’s like having your own seat warmers wherever you go!

Hi, I’m Tayson. I started Outdoor Vitals to help outdoor enthusiasts “Live Ultralight” through the use of premium ultralight products that cut down on waste. My team and I believe Living Ultralight means using premium gear that works in any weather, is easy to pack, and won’t slow you down. It means buying less quantity to fill up our earth’s landfills and buying more quality products that are ready for all your adventures.
I knew that premium gear was inherently lighter, lasted longer, and provided better outdoor experiences. However, the price of the gear was out of reach for me and my family. I wanted outdoor adventurers to spend less on gear and more on experiences.
That’s why I designed Outdoor Vitals to sell directly to consumers and cut out middlemen retailers that markup prices sometimes by double. With this business model, we’ve been able to get quality products out to you for 40-50% less than a retail store.
I also recognize that I’m very fortunate to be where I am, while others around the world are not as fortunate. So Outdoor Vitals donates 1% of our revenue to sustainable poverty projects around the world.This will be our 3rd crowdfunding campaign. Our last campaign raised over $750,000 on Kickstarter and continued to hit over $1,000,000 on Indiegogo!
When we started, we only had $500 to put into the company — and we never took venture capital. We determined that a family-owned company is better at creating value for customers. While the company has grown to be a 9 figure brand, it's still extremely vital to our growth that we use crowdfunding platforms to help us compete with investment company-owned or venture capital-backed outdoor brands. We believe that focusing on long term value for our customers is more important than reporting to investors about how to maximize the next month’s profits.
The Outdoor Vitals team is made up of passionate outdoor enthusiasts that understand the demands and needs of outdoor attire and accessories. We constantly push the envelope by finding the latest and most innovative materials to build our products, and the Satu Pants are our biggest innovation yet!

<li>
<strong>fund this limited production run!</strong> We know how much work goes into our creations, but we still want better lingerie to be accessible to as many people as we can reach. By producing this batch in the pre-order format, we are able to <strong>bring the price per piece down</strong> to $55/$65, while <strong>keeping every piece of them handmade in-house</strong>. That's about <strong>average</strong> for what all of the customers throughout our size range might pay for an underwire bra -- for a handmade garment that makes you feel <strong>way more comfy &amp; pretty</strong> than an old beige boulder-holder.</li>
<li> <strong>add 8 new cup sizes to our core range</strong> this year. We just added 14 thanks to our Kickstarter campaign last fall! We're looking forward to grading &amp; patterning these new sizes throughout all of our offerings. Help us out with budgeting the time &amp; resources for it -- get yourself something pretty.</li>
<li>
<strong>working on new designs, including future additions to our swimwear collection!</strong> We know -- swimwear is in basically as bad of a spot as traditional bralettes when it comes to the size and fit offerings available. We're so ready to bring some pretty, unique swim designs to everyone who needs a little more support in the summertime. Hopefully, this campaign will help us have more time and budget for sourcing new materials, creating new designs, and photographing them on plenty of dreamy U.S. babes.</li>
<li>
<strong>growing &amp; training our team!</strong> We currently have one of the<strong> fastest shipping windows</strong> for handmade lingerie, at accessible prices for <strong>great construction that's ethically produced</strong>. To keep it that way and pursuing our goals to bring better lingerie &amp; representative images to people everywhere, we're going to need help. <strong>Your support directly helps us create a lingerie shopping experience that's a dream for all.</strong>

</div><h2>Risks, challenges, &amp; transparency</h2><p>Last fall, our previous crowdfunding campaign was <strong>fully funded in just 5 days. </strong>30% of our preorders for that campaign were scheduled for holiday delivery. In just a three-month turnaround, those delivery goals were met. This time around, we've given ourselves a few extra weeks of time to budget for that same delivery deadline. We have also learned so much from organizing and shipping our last campaign's rewards. As a response, we've streamlined our offerings here so everyone gets their rewards as quickly as possible. The styles we're offering here have already been through a production round, so we have a really good grasp of how much time they take our team to create and produce.<br/><br/>Should we vastly exceed or goal, we're confident that we'll be able to scale production no matter how overfunded our campaign gets -- we'd actually love the opportunity to! Our production becomes more simple for us the more people participate in this preorder, so spread the word and share the campaign. </p><p> Production always comes with specific snags and challenges, but we are uniquely positioned as a brand in complete control of its development, from design to production. Because we produce everything in-house, there are no factory tie-ups and middle men to throw obstacles in our way. There's no miscommunicating on patterns and measurements; there's no mysterious fulfillment center where stock can disappear. We've already got several years of business under our belt, so we know how to handle our own production (because we handle that AND every other aspect of our business ourselves!) We have streamlined our offerings for this campaign to minimize loose ends and make organizing production as seamless as possible.</p><p>Really close customer service is one of our favorite things, so don't worry -- our backers will be receiving tons of updates, notes, photos, social media posts, and the like as we move forward. If even the slightest of delays turn up for any reason, you'll be the first to know.</p><p>One concern might be how we plan to handle expanding our team. Good news: we both have several years of experience managing and training interns and assistants. The structure of our company is well prepared to handle new additions, and we've already successfully grown our company since our last campaign.</p><p>Larger scale -- since we've gone over our confidence in fulfilling our rewards, we just want to mention we're also very confident about the goals we've set for ourselves with this campaign. They are all projects that are in process at the studio already, to varying extents, and we'll be keeping you updated on how they continue to develop before and after your rewards are sent out. We have already accomplished many of the initiatives we set out to achieve with our last crowdfunding campaign, so we know exactly what we're capable of and we're ready to keep going!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500065158/knvsxxf3ovi4cbsm9xrd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>If you don't want to try our lingerie (or if you don't wear it yourself), but you like what we're doing and think we should keep at it, please consider donating, shopping for someone else, or checking out the smaller rewards we're offering -- even $1 helps! If you can't donate, consider sharing the campaign with someone you know who might appreciate it too. Shares really do help us out! </p><p>Thank you so much for supporting us with our campaign. We admire the consciousness and thoughtfulness we've noticed among the people who choose to shop with us and support our projects, and we appreciate the trust and care that often goes into supporting a small brand with big ideas. </p><h2>#WeLoveUye!</h2></div>","Your bra is the most functional piece of clothing you put on your body, and you rely on its support each and every day.

They're everything you love about your favorite bra + everything you love about a bralette in one package, with none of the annoying parts of either.Want to try one out? You're in luck. We're funding a limited run of our most accessible style right here on IndieGogo right now. You can try one out, handmade just for you in any size, starting at $55.Raji wears Victoria in White, 30G. Tiffany wears Victoria in White, 32B.Sam wears Helena in Peony, 28D. Stella wears Helena in Black, 42D.Like all of our styles, Helena & Victoria take every feature you love from your favorite bra, and marries it with soft comfort and effortless elegance of bralettes. Added in to the mix? Our signature clever design, gorgeous shapes, and beautiful fabrics. Tired of plain and wish you could find a lacy little thing in your size? Helena is for you, available in three colors at $55. Want an everyday basic with superpowered support in a neutral, lace-free cup? Victoria is your new best bra, and just $65 here on IndieGogo.Lohla wears Helena in Geode, 28D, and our matching Simple Panty in Fluorite, size S. Helena in Infinite Black is also pictured.Andy wears Helena in Infinite Black, 32B, and matching Simple Panty in Black. Stella wears her Helena Bra in 42D. Lohla wears Helena in Geode, 28D, and matching Simple Panty in size S.Raji wears Helena in Peony, size 30G. Andy wears Helena in Peony, size 32B.Lohla wears Victoria in White, 28D. It's also pictured here in Black.Lana wears Victoria in Black, 34C. Stella wears hers in 42D. We have a super simple, two-step sizing system. We just take two measurements and craft our bralettes to measure by band and cup. If you don't see your size on this chart, or if you have other fit concerns, we also offer free custom sizing, at no extra charge. We also offer panties in sizes XS through 3XL, along with -- you guessed it! -- free custom sizing. To be honest? We are a tiny team, and as more and more people discover the magic of U.S., we need to grow! We love handcrafting our bralettes one-by-one – it's what enables us to really perfect the fit and give excellent customer service for each and every person who discovers us. We couldn't pull it off if we moved our production to a factory. So we need your help to keep our super-small and efficient team at the studio.You see, it's kind of a win-win for U.S. & you. Because you're pre-ordering your styles here on IndieGogo, we get to organize our production so we can make them a little more affordable. You get to enjoy our usual beautiful handmade craftsmanship on fully-featured, extra-supportive garments at a more accessible price than our general retail. You support us, we support you. And the U.S. team gets to work on even more projects that make everything we do even better. Here's a little chart of all the things you'll be helping us achieve when you order your new bra through this campaign:When you pre-order your new bra through this campaign, you'll know that you are directly helping us achieve all of these goals:

fund this limited production run! We know how much work goes into our creations, but we still want better lingerie to be accessible to as many people as we can reach. By producing this batch in the pre-order format, we are able to bring the price per piece down to $55/$65, while keeping every piece of them handmade in-house. That's about average for what all of the customers throughout our size range might pay for an underwire bra -- for a handmade garment that makes you feel way more comfy & pretty than an old beige boulder-holder.
 add 8 new cup sizes to our core range this year. We just added 14 thanks to our Kickstarter campaign last fall! We're looking forward to grading & patterning these new sizes throughout all of our offerings. Help us out with budgeting the time & resources for it -- get yourself something pretty.

working on new designs, including future additions to our swimwear collection! We know -- swimwear is in basically as bad of a spot as traditional bralettes when it comes to the size and fit offerings available. We're so ready to bring some pretty, unique swim designs to everyone who needs a little more support in the summertime. Hopefully, this campaign will help us have more time and budget for sourcing new materials, creating new designs, and photographing them on plenty of dreamy U.S. babes.

growing & training our team! We currently have one of the fastest shipping windows for handmade lingerie, at accessible prices for great construction that's ethically produced. To keep it that way and pursuing our goals to bring better lingerie & representative images to people everywhere, we're going to need help. Your support directly helps us create a lingerie shopping experience that's a dream for all.

Current production stageGood news -- we've already offered these styles before! That means almost every step of the process is completed, including:
creating the patterns, grading the sizing, testing and fitting the sizes
ordering the fabrics, hand-dyeing or ordering any components
creating samples, further assessing the materials and design
producing & selling the product range 
We have an excellent idea at this point of how long our production runs on these styles and how smoothly it ran for us last time. That means we couldn't be more confident about the quality of product we're offering to you! We also feel pretty good about the timeline we've set for ourselves.Reviews, press & more!Click here to read selected features: NYLON Magazine Studio Tour | Refinery29 Feature | Huffington Post | Allure | Reviews & features at The Lingerie Addict | Sweet | Harper's Bazaar |    Happy customers from our last campaign & website orders: 
 

 

 
Risks, challenges, & transparencyLast fall, our previous crowdfunding campaign was fully funded in just 5 days. 30% of our preorders for that campaign were scheduled for holiday delivery. In just a three-month turnaround, those delivery goals were met. This time around, we've given ourselves a few extra weeks of time to budget for that same delivery deadline. We have also learned so much from organizing and shipping our last campaign's rewards. As a response, we've streamlined our offerings here so everyone gets their rewards as quickly as possible. The styles we're offering here have already been through a production round, so we have a really good grasp of how much time they take our team to create and produce.Should we vastly exceed or goal, we're confident that we'll be able to scale production no matter how overfunded our campaign gets -- we'd actually love the opportunity to! Our production becomes more simple for us the more people participate in this preorder, so spread the word and share the campaign.  Production always comes with specific snags and challenges, but we are uniquely positioned as a brand in complete control of its development, from design to production. Because we produce everything in-house, there are no factory tie-ups and middle men to throw obstacles in our way. There's no miscommunicating on patterns and measurements; there's no mysterious fulfillment center where stock can disappear. We've already got several years of business under our belt, so we know how to handle our own production (because we handle that AND every other aspect of our business ourselves!) We have streamlined our offerings for this campaign to minimize loose ends and make organizing production as seamless as possible.Really close customer service is one of our favorite things, so don't worry -- our backers will be receiving tons of updates, notes, photos, social media posts, and the like as we move forward. If even the slightest of delays turn up for any reason, you'll be the first to know.One concern might be how we plan to handle expanding our team. Good news: we both have several years of experience managing and training interns and assistants. The structure of our company is well prepared to handle new additions, and we've already successfully grown our company since our last campaign.Larger scale -- since we've gone over our confidence in fulfilling our rewards, we just want to mention we're also very confident about the goals we've set for ourselves with this campaign. They are all projects that are in process at the studio already, to varying extents, and we'll be keeping you updated on how they continue to develop before and after your rewards are sent out. We have already accomplished many of the initiatives we set out to achieve with our last crowdfunding campaign, so we know exactly what we're capable of and we're ready to keep going!If you don't want to try our lingerie (or if you don't wear it yourself), but you like what we're doing and think we should keep at it, please consider donating, shopping for someone else, or checking out the smaller rewards we're offering -- even $1 helps! If you can't donate, consider sharing the campaign with someone you know who might appreciate it too. Shares really do help us out! Thank you so much for supporting us with our campaign. We admire the consciousness and thoughtfulness we've noticed among the people who choose to shop with us and support our projects, and we appreciate the trust and care that often goes into supporting a small brand with big ideas. #WeLoveUye!",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>We all love sunglasses!</b> They’re the first thing someone notices about you. Having the right shades can be the difference maker in how we look, how we feel, and even how we perform.<b>Most of all we just want our sunglasses to go together with everything</b> we do just like hats, shoes or handbags. <b>shades</b>club™ is an all-inclusive solution for sunglasses.</p>
<h1>Tired of paying $100s for sunglasses and losing them? </h1>

<p><b>Sunglasses are expensive!</b> Marked up to over 20 times what they actually cost to make. With the huge price tags, it’s been impossible to afford all the sunglasses you need. You lose and break them easily, and they’re a pain to purchase and replace. Fighting over parking spots, long lines, poor service, the locked up cases, the brutal price gouging and shadiness. We were completely fed up.</p>
<p><b>So, we created a new way!</b> We’re cracking open the sunglasses vault, giving you access to the one combination that’s always demanded, but never existed: <b>Sunglasses that are incredibly designed and incredibly priced at the same time</b></p>

shadesclub™ - The World's First Subscription Box for Sunglasses!
We all love sunglasses! They’re the first thing someone notices about you. Having the right shades can be the difference maker in how we look, how we feel, and even how we perform.Most of all we just want our sunglasses to go together with everything we do just like hats, shoes or handbags. shadesclub™ is an all-inclusive solution for sunglasses.
Tired of paying $100s for sunglasses and losing them? 


Sunglasses are expensive! Marked up to over 20 times what they actually cost to make. With the huge price tags, it’s been impossible to afford all the sunglasses you need. You lose and break them easily, and they’re a pain to purchase and replace. Fighting over parking spots, long lines, poor service, the locked up cases, the brutal price gouging and shadiness. We were completely fed up.
So, we created a new way! We’re cracking open the sunglasses vault, giving you access to the one combination that’s always demanded, but never existed: Sunglasses that are incredibly designed and incredibly priced at the same time


Make no mistake – there was a lot of work to be done here! If you were to go out today and buy 12 designer pairs, you’d easily spend well over $1,500.00! 
This, is shadesclub™


It’s 12 premium pairs for the price of 1. It’s an entire collection in your home. We think you’ll really be into it. It’s simple, fun and affordable. Each month your shadesclub™ box will feature a brand new pair of sunglasses, designed for you to create new ways to coordinate and accessorize your world. We added modern convenience of home delivery, super-flexible terms and great service. All at the push of a button.
With shades for guys, and shades for girls.

Designed to fit comfortably for all face shapes!
Delivered right to your door.

To answer your question...YES, of course you get to keep the shades!
So you can own an entire collection.

Giving you something to look forward to!
Your shades will change, but the familiar quality won’t and that’s our secret recipe. We make your shades at the same places as the world’s largest brands, and take away the huge markups while passing the savings on to you. With your continued support as a member, we can keep the quality high and prices low for our community. 
It’s simple, fun and affordable.


shadesclub™ is an all-inclusive solution for sunglasses, featuring each month's best styles, loaded with accessories and delivered right to your door. We think you’ll really be into it.Now, we need your support to lead the revolution to make shadesclub™ a reality.

Our trusted ability as designers is backed by an impressive, less than 1% return rate.We've been fully-focused over the past 5 years, with our own existing brand, Dicks Cottons. People who have tried our sunglasses, appreciate better quality and prices.

Our customers have become our inspiration, as well as our friends. Naturally, shadesclub™ was created to take things even further, continuing to disrupt the industry, by pure demand.What people are saying.To us a stranger is just a friend we haven't met, yet!We've secured established industry connections, giving us the ability to make really nice quality eyewear.

We’ve created a men’s garment that makes your first layer your best layer. We believe that every day is an adventure. We believe in intimacy. We believe in starting from the beginning. And we believe that, sometimes, the craziest ideas are the best ones. Creating EROIX is an expression of these beliefs. We started from the beginning. With your closest wearing garment.And got this crazy idea:  We said no to what every other underwear manufacturer is doing: We said NoLastic to Elastic. We created a precise, tailored, true-to-size fit that embraces your body instead of constricting or hanging off of it.   We’ve made your first layer just as good looking as the rest of your clothing. Something you can be proud to wear and to be seen in.

<p>on a plane ride back from new york city, our founder fatima (hi!) noticed a really trendy, hipster girl wearing a necklace with hearts gemstones that didn't match her skinny jeans, beanie, and motorcycle boots...at all.</p>

<p>the GRID is the first industrial-chic necklace that celebrates a special date without compromising style.</p>

<div>
<p>BEVY's really been a labor of love for us -- we've worked tirelessly drawing and refining our design, getting 3D CAD illustrations and molds made for manufacturing over the last several months. we have our prototype ready, some photography complete, packaging design nearly done, and now we simply need to start manufacturing.</p>
<p>the quality of our pieces is really important to us so we've chosen to work with an excellent local manufacturer in portland, oregon.</p>
<p>however, since every one of our pieces is personalized and custom, our costs are higher than the average jewelry business. but there are ways that we can bring our costs down and make every piece affordable (but awesome quality) for you.</p>
<h3>...and here's where you come in.</h3>
<p>we need to raise <strong>$6,500 within the next 20 days</strong> so that we can:</p>
<p></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>pre-order 26 inch necklace chains in silver and gold in bulk.</span></li>
<li>place batch orders of pendants in silver and gold-plated silver (that we will then customize after each order). batch orders help dramatically reduce set up cost and keep each piece affordable for you.</li>
<li>complete packaging design and place our initial packaging orders.</li>
<li>order more photography for our website.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div></div>
<p></p>
<p>with our perks, we want to show our enormous appreciation for your help in getting us on our feet and give you first dibs at these amazing necklaces.</p>
<p>more than that, our goal is to turn BEVY into a full line of customized jewelry with the GRID necklace being our first of many pieces.</p>
<p>in addition to all of the perks listed on our indiegogo page, we'd also like to offer that all contributors in this initial round of funding will eligible for special ""GRID Founders"" discounts on future orders. </p>
<h3>...and here's the great news!</h3>
<p>our perks are designed for us to guarantee that we can deliver on what we're offering but the closer we can get to our goal, the bigger the batches we can order, which will help us reduce our expenses and build the inventory we expect for the holiday season.</p>

<h2>other ways you can help</h2>
<p>we cannot wait to get started and your contributions will mean everything to our little operation. </p>
<p>but there are other ways you can help too: spread the word! let your friends and family (and anyone looking for a sexy, unique, and meaningful gift for the holidays) know about the GRID.</p>
<p>if we get less than 50 people to purchase a necklace, we've met our goal and will hit the ground running! that's only two per day from anywhere in the world-- so please spread the word!</p>

<h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"">The <a href=""http://www.teeshare.com/en/concept/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""the teeshare concept"">concept</a> can be summed up in three basic points:</span></p>
<ol>
<li class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Re-elaborating a product we all love, one that has accompanied us since our very first adventures: the t-shirt;</span></li>
<li class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Choosing to enhance the value of the made-in-Italy concept: we work with Italian fabrics in Italian workshops and cooperatives, with communities and workers from marginalized sectors, retired people, artisans and long-standing friends;</span></li>
<li class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Collaborating with artists and <span>designers, dreamers and special guests, mixing threads, sewing colors, joining ideas and sharing them by means of a t-shirt: so it’s actually more than a t-shirt, it’s “teeshare.”</span></span></span></li>
</ol>
<p class=""western"" lang=""en-US""><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Our project is also involved with <a href=""http://www.admo.it/English.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Admo"">ADMO</a> (the Italian bone marrow donor association). In fact, part of our revenue from the two collections we have finished thus far was devolved to this non-profit organization.</span> </p>
<h3>OUR COLLECTIONS</h3>

<p><a name=""versioneitaliana"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p></div>","AN ITALIAN PROJECT CREATED AROUND THE CONCEPT OF SHARING
For us, sharing is more than a good intention: it’s a daily practice and our de facto fundamental trait. We wanted to make this clear from the very beginning by inserting it in the brand name “teeshare”: a composite of the word “sharing” and “tee” as a diminutive of t-shirt, our staple product. 
We financed the launch of the teeshare project ourselves, with our own resources. This time around, we need a little help to cover some of the expenses to develop the new collection, which we would like to present in October. With your support, we can create new teeshare models, develop two new prototypes, purchase the fabric and create new personalized articles with artists, as well as funding the photographic services for the new models and investing in advertisement to promote our teeshare website. 
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS

      

WHAT WE DO
The concept can be summed up in three basic points:

Re-elaborating a product we all love, one that has accompanied us since our very first adventures: the t-shirt;
Choosing to enhance the value of the made-in-Italy concept: we work with Italian fabrics in Italian workshops and cooperatives, with communities and workers from marginalized sectors, retired people, artisans and long-standing friends;
Collaborating with artists and designers, dreamers and special guests, mixing threads, sewing colors, joining ideas and sharing them by means of a t-shirt: so it’s actually more than a t-shirt, it’s “teeshare.”

Our project is also involved with ADMO (the Italian bone marrow donor association). In fact, part of our revenue from the two collections we have finished thus far was devolved to this non-profit organization. 
OUR COLLECTIONS
The two collections we have created so far:
the first was a permanent unisex line made of basic yet exclusive models, with handmade embroidery, serigraphy (the silkscreen printing process), paintings, minutias, natural materials, poems and illustrations.
   the second collection was born from an exchange of ideas with painters, photographers, designers, writers and musicians, who create their exclusive works of art on an unusual media in a limited edition, with great artistic and artisanal value.   


THE IMPACT
We won’t be the only ones involved in all of this: the entire teeshare chain will be on board, from creation to production. Let me seize this opportunity to present them.
Who sews 
the women’s collection is made in the dress shop “L’Orlando Furioso” The workshop was originally created as an opportunity for rehabilitation and reintegration by providing vocational skills for people with mental health issues through the project “Un progetto per ricucire” (which loosely translates into “a project to mend”).
The men’s collection is made in the tailor’s shop “Il Gelso” created by eight women from different backgrounds, with the common objective of creating work opportunities in the textile and fashion sector. In 2009 it became part of Ergonauti, a social cooperative for work placement.
Who prints
“Tessuto Sociale” is a serigraphy workshop; it is part of the project “Cooperativa Terra del Fuoco-Lavoro,” which works in full respect of human dignity and workers’ rights. 
Andrea Molinatti is the freelance graphic designer who will take care of our prints in his serigraphy workshop, with his meticulous care and patience.
Sericraft is a young and motivated group specialized in serigraphy. Their handwork, their artisanal precision, and their search for constant innovations make our prints flawless.
Who embroiders
our embroidery comes to life thanks to the needle-and-thread of Francesca Bianco, a freelancer who discovered her passion for sewing and started working for the German fashion designers “Born in Berlin for fashionists.”
Liso Pasqualina and Rosa help us out with anything requiring dexterity and experience as they take care of details and fine embroidery.
Who paints
Tamara Pelà, a professional restorer, approached the world of fashion as a fashion designer for various fashion consulting agencies. She brings to teeshare her passion for painting and the precision of her fabric restoration skills.

Who tags

we want our external tags to be objects that could be re-used and collected. These labels are periodically renewed and made from different materials, and consequently prepared by different artisans and workshops. We started with “all white” because it was love at first sight. “All white” by Daniela Orlando, a ceramist and a restorer: she started by fixing broken things and then went on to making new ones in porcelain; after all, despite being made of earth, in the end porcelain is a material as precious as a jewel

VERSIONE ITALIANA


UN PROGETTO ITALIANO CREATO SUL CONCETTO DI CONDIVISIONE
La condivisione non é per noi solo un buon proposito, ma una pratica quotidiana e di fatto la nostra caratteristica fondamentale. Abbiamo voluto che fosse chiaro sin dal principio inserendolo nel nostro marchio teeshare: “share” in inglese significa condividere, che insieme alla parola “tee” richiama la parola t-shirt, che è quello che facciamo.  
Con le nostre risorse abbiamo finanziato il lancio del progetto teeshare. Ora ti chiediamo un aiuto per sostenere parte dei costi per lo sviluppo di una nuova linea che vorremmo far uscire a Ottobre. Con il vostro supporto potremmo realizzare due nuovi modelli di teeshare, sviluppare due nuovi prototipi, coprire i costi per l’acquisto dei tessuti, creare nuove personalizzazioni anche con artisti, finanziare il servizio fotografico per i nuovi modelli, investire in pubblicità per promuovere il sito teeshare.
ARTICLES AND REVIEWS

      

COSA FACCIAMO
Il concept si puó riassumere in tre punti fondamentali:


rielaborare un prodotto che amiamo, la nostra prima compagna di avventura, la t-shirt;


scegliere di valorizzare il fatto in Italia: tessuti italiani, laboratori italiani, cooperative, comunità, persone, lavoratori appartenenti a fasce protette, pensionati, artigiani e amici di sempre;

collaborare insieme ad artisti e designer, sognatori ed ospiti speciali, mescolare fili, cucire colori, unire le idee per condividerle grazie ad una t-shirt... anzi ”teeshare”.

Il nostro é un progetto che coinvolge l’ADMO (associazione donatori midollo osseo) a cui viene sempre devoluto parte del nostro ricavato dalle due collezioni finora terminate.
LE NOSTRE COLLEZIONI
Le due collezioni che abbiamo finora creato sono:
una permanente uomo e donna, fatta di modelli semplici ma esclusivi in cui trovano identità ricami a mano, serigrafie, dipinti, minuterie, materiali naturali, poesie e illustrazioni. 
   
La seconda, nasce dallo scambio di idee con pittori, fotografi, designer, scrittori e musicisti, diventando un nuovo supporto su cui pensare un’opera inedita, in serie limitate, di alto valore artistico e artigianale.
   


NON SIAMO SOLI
Tutto questo coinvolgerà non solo noi di teeshare, ma l'intera catena di progettazione e produzione del progetto, ve li presentiamo:
Chi cuce 
la collezione donna è prodotta dalla sartoria l’orlando furioso, la quale nasce come attività riabilitativa per l’acquisizione di competenze professionali nell’ambito della salute mentale. “Un progetto per ricucire” che ha come aree di intervento la reintegrazione delle fasce deboli.
La collezione uomo è confezionata dalla sartoria il gelso, nata per iniziativa di otto donne, provenienti da mondi diversi, con l’obiettivo di creare opportunità di lavoro nel contesto tessile e moda. Dal 2009 fa parte di ergonauti, cooperativa sociale di inserimento lavorativo.
Chi stampa
tessuto sociale, laboratorio serigrafico, è uno dei progetti della Cooperativa Terra del Fuoco-Lavoro che opera nel rispetto della dignità e dei diritti dei lavoratori. Andrea molinatti grafico freelance e laboratorio serigrafico che si prenderà cura delle nostre stampe con minuziosa pazienza e attenzione.sericraft gruppo giovane e motivato, specialista nella stampa serigrafica. il lavoro manuale, la precisione artigiana e lo spirito della ricerca nella continua innovazione rendono impeccabili le nostre stampe.
Chi ricama
nostri ricami prendono vita dal lavoro di francesca bianco, libera professionista la quale scopre la passione per il taglio e cucito iniziando a lavorare per le stiliste tedesche di “ Born in Berlin for fashionists”.
liso pasqualina e rosa ci aiutano in tutto ciò che ha bisogno di manualità ed esperienza nella cura dei dettagli e per i ricami a mano.
Chi dipinge
Tamara pelà, professionista restauratrice, si avvicina al mondo della moda come fashion designer per vari studi di consulenza moda, trasporta la sua passione per la pittura e la precisione del restauro su tessuto per teeshare.

Chi impasta

vogliamo che le etichette esterne siano un oggetto da riutilizzare e collezionare. Sono periodicamente rinnovate ed elaborate in diversi materiali e di conseguenza con artigiani e laboratori differenti. Iniziamo con all white perché è stato amore a prima vista. all white di daniela orlando, ceramista, restauratrice. Dall’aggiustare cose rotte, è passata a farne di nuove, in porcellana, perché nonostante sia solo terra la porcellana è un materiale prezioso come un gioiello.

<p>Hello family and friends! <br/></p>
<p>We are humbly and graciously asking for your support in order to help us take the next step in our business journey.  We have been invited back to present our Hey Jude collection at Vancouver Eco Fashion Week this October and due to a close deadline and a big company step in renting our own work studio this Summer, we really need some help! </p>
<p>Having had presented and learned a great deal from last seasons experience, we are incredibly excited at the opportunity to flex our creative muscles once more and show the city of Vancouver (and beyond) what we are made of. Having impressed so many with our presentation last season we feel that taking the step to present for a consecutive season where we can maximize on the industries anticipation to ""see what we do next,"" is a really smart step for Hey Jude to take. </p>
<p>We would like to ask without any pressure or expectation for you to make a donation to purchase one of our packages and in return we will pass along some awesome perks/gift cards and a great big thank you SO much! If you are unable to, we completely understand and just ask that you send some some positive vibes and energy our way! Oh, and we'd still love to see you rooting us on at our show! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Okay, so here is the nitty gritty...</p>
<p>To participate at these events it costs a lot of money. (For example; we were approached to present this fall at LA Fashion week which would have cost us up to 18k). In return they provide you with most of the organizing, personal backstage, a phenomenal venue, guaranteed press and promotion, a publicist, showroom manager  and the opportunity to propel your brand into being known by the general public (which then translates into followers and buyers for your brand). We passed on LA Fashion Week for this season having really mulling and weighing the pros and cons and coming to the conclusion that we still have more to grow within our own city before we take over North America (and hey, it's going to happen!). We really believe that we've created a strong foundation for our business and we are on the brink of our tipping point for when our dream becomes our livelihood. </p>
<p>The $3000 we are hoping to raise through this campaign will be added to our profits from a one night shop + social event we are going to host at our studio before Eco Fashion Week and will hopefully allow us to successfully present our best collection yet for Eco Fashion Week. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What we need the money for:</p>
<p>- Participation Fee (this covers all the staging and lighting, professional models, professional hair and make-up teams, runway production, designer seminars, promotion and press, a publisist and a showroom manager to show our brand to buyers).</p>
<p>- Promotion Costs (photo shoot of our product styling with a professional photographer, model and make-up artist and printing promotional materials to be put on the seats at our show).</p>
<p>- Clothing (2+ buying trips to get our pieces for the show. Our buying trips include us waking up at 6am to hit the road for a 12-14+ hour day of driving and hunting.)</p>
<p>- Extra Costs (buying shoes and accessories to be used for our show, music, undergarments and styling supplies, etc.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/70548/files/20130912145443-photoshootbanner.jpg?1379022883"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>What do we do if we have some extra money? </p>
<p>Well, it could happen. And if that's the case, we want to up front and honest so you can trust what we're doing with our donations. If we exceed our goal and have a little bit of extra dough we will be using that to directly fund our next pop-up shop that is scheduled to take place in late October/November. We are going to host our best shop yet and really want to focus on finding a prime location this time around in a high traffic area! But as you know; the better the real estate the higher the cost. </p>
<p>Are you wondering why we don't have the money already? Do our clothes sell? Is this a smart investment? </p>
<p>Well, here's the hard numbers...</p>
<p>For us to host a pop-up shop it costs $2500-$6000 depending on location, decor, promotional costs and how much product we need to buy. We've had 5 pop-ups to date. Up until this point we have sold over $30,000 worth of vintage clothing and have reinvested every penny back into our business. This means our business has steadily and organically grown DEBT FREE. We have a good amount of product in inventory, company supplies (hello $300 steamers!), pop-up decor, an incredible collection of photos from creative shoots and an amazing following of customers! We know eventually to take it to the next level we will need to take out a loan or get an investor but for now we'd really like to invite our family and friends to be apart of our success and help us stretch a little farther before we need to take it to that point. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This time around with our gained knowledge/wisdom of how this event works; we are really excited to take full advantage of what this opportunity can do for Hey Jude. Having already received press in The Province, Georgia Straight, Metro News, Scout Magazine, Global TV and New York based magazines Suitcase and SHK, we are looking to grow our media exposure with our presentation and will be sending out a press release to all Canadian based fashion magazines. As well, we are looking to take this opportunity to promote (for the first time at a event), our new online store and upcoming pop-up shop that will be this Fall featuring a large collection of what you will preview on the runway. Having never had such a large outlet to promote these events for ourselves and it is going to be extremely beneficial for us. <br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>We also can't let you know our bit about the impact without mentioning the environment. Honestly, we didn't initially make the decision to have a company based on vintage clothing because of the environmental impact it had. But having being educated in the matter since and really taking an interest in it, we are extremely proud of the fact that we have chosen a greener way to dress ourselves and you.  A few reasons why we are so passionate about not contributing to ""fast fashion"" (this is all the mass produced, high volume garments that are made for next to nothing and sold by all the giant retailers) is because it is extremely harmful to the environment, causes air pollution, depletes water resources, increases the use of harmful chemicals and increases our oil use. The average person throws away 68 pounds of clothing a year. When you multiply that by how many people are in your city it becomes a serious number. We are passionate about being on the other side of that fight by recycling, reusing and choosing to be eco-conscious in our purchases and practices. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Aside from your donations (in exchange for some fun gifts and GCs of course!), we accept: positive energy, salt &amp; vinegar chips (essential during our long prepping hours), good blessings &amp; prayers, you telling all your friends about Hey Jude and inviting them  to our events and just a good old like or comment on our social media to reassure us that we haven't annoyed you with our posting just yet. </p>

<h2><strong><em>The Inspiration Behind Pixie Splitz....</em></strong></h2>
<p>   Almost every child seems to go through a difficult phase of learning to put shoes on the correct feet. I have worked at a child development center for the past 6 years, and have observed this dilemma among young children. Children like to be independent, therefore this causes frustration.This can be time consuming for parents and caretakers of little independents! :) I began to observe closer when the children would choose a shoe, it was simply a guessing game! There is no indication from a child's viewpoint to have the cognitive ability for order when putting on shoes! Shoes are not kid friendly! </p>
<h3 class=""template asset""><img alt=""Putting shoes on with the Split Image Indication Technique"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/195/025/967a349669ff53c0e3928649ef56f0f4_large.jpg?1349551970"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3 class=""template asset"">   Putting shoes on with the Split Image Indication Technique</h3>
<p>  </p>
<p>It does not really matter how much time, money, and effort is spent on the design and structure of a shoe if it never makes it to the correct foot! Children love being independent! Shoes should be fun and exciting! This is why I have created Pixie Splitz! These are insole inserts for children that have split images on them to indicate the order for children! An effective, yet simple, two piece puzzle!!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The inserts are being launched on Indiegogo in six colorful and exciting images! Each insert will be printed on 3mm white neoprene. This is a thin material used for wetsuits, koozies, laptop sleeves,etc...I selected neoprene because it can be water resistant and withstand fluctuated temperature levels. It is thin enough to fit in the bottom of a child's shoe, yet a smooth surface for comfort. Each footprint will be 6"" long and 3"" wide, with a half inch of white neoprene on each side, resulting in approximately a 7""x7"" dimension. The inserts will be easy to use and beneficial! (recommended for children ages 1-6 yrs old)</p>
<h2><strong><em>Directions...</em></strong></h2>
<p>1. Place insert on a hard surface</p>
<p>2. Have child stand on footprints ( or use existing shoes insoles)</p>
<p>3. Use a pen or marker to trace around each foot (or insoles) for desired measurements</p>
<p>4. Have child step off inserts. Then trim inserts to size</p>
<p>5. Place inserts in shoes!</p>

<p>It's time to stop the confusion! Help me on my journey to revolutionize the way children are being introduced to shoes! We can make a difference, but I need your help! :) The initial order is 5,000 inserts, that's several children, and I'm excited to reach out to others with Pixie Splitz! So PLEASE help me get started!</p>

<div id=""risks"">
<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h3>
<p>I am in the process of setting up an online store offering Pixie Splitz, but you have the opportunity of being the first in helping me revolutionize the way we can market children's shoes! The industry is overlooking how an insole can be benificial to children. Imaging on most children's shoes currently have mirrored imaging. This is cute, but what advantage does it create for children? My goal is to work with leading shoe manufacturers and start a split image indication printing system. This way split images can be directly printed in the insoles of children's shoes. It is a new and exciting way to market children's shoes, yet beneficial to the ones wearing them--CHILDREN!! :)</p>

Shoes should be fun and exciting! This is why I have created Pixie Splitz! These are insole inserts for children that have split images on them to indicate the order for children! An effective, yet simple, two piece puzzle!!
 

Pixie Splitz Designs
The inserts are being launched on Indiegogo in six colorful and exciting images! Each insert will be printed on 3mm white neoprene. This is a thin material used for wetsuits, koozies, laptop sleeves,etc...I selected neoprene because it can be water resistant and withstand fluctuated temperature levels. It is thin enough to fit in the bottom of a child's shoe, yet a smooth surface for comfort. Each footprint will be 6"" long and 3"" wide, with a half inch of white neoprene on each side, resulting in approximately a 7""x7"" dimension. The inserts will be easy to use and beneficial! (recommended for children ages 1-6 yrs old)
Directions...
1. Place insert on a hard surface
2. Have child stand on footprints ( or use existing shoes insoles)
3. Use a pen or marker to trace around each foot (or insoles) for desired measurements
4. Have child step off inserts. Then trim inserts to size
5. Place inserts in shoes!
 

Successful Split Imaging Zebra!
It's time to stop the confusion! Help me on my journey to revolutionize the way children are being introduced to shoes! We can make a difference, but I need your help! :) The initial order is 5,000 inserts, that's several children, and I'm excited to reach out to others with Pixie Splitz! So PLEASE help me get started!
 
 

Risks and challenges
I am in the process of setting up an online store offering Pixie Splitz, but you have the opportunity of being the first in helping me revolutionize the way we can market children's shoes! The industry is overlooking how an insole can be benificial to children. Imaging on most children's shoes currently have mirrored imaging. This is cute, but what advantage does it create for children? My goal is to work with leading shoe manufacturers and start a split image indication printing system. This way split images can be directly printed in the insoles of children's shoes. It is a new and exciting way to market children's shoes, yet beneficial to the ones wearing them--CHILDREN!! :)",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

to roll out our newest sock—a low rise athletic sock that can be used for a variety of activities such as golfing,  running,
tennis, and cycling.  And we are very excited to be teaming up with the amazing
PGA HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere) as our beneficiary. For
every pair of these LIFT23 socks purchased, we alternate between donating a
pair of socks to a Veteran recovering in a VA hospital, and donating a portion
of our profits to PGA HOPE.  PGA HOPE is a proven program that partners
with VA hospitals and uses golf as an activity to both assist veterans with
their progress in rehab and help them assimilate back into their community
through the social interaction the game provides.  </span><br/></p>

WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT LIFT23's SOCKS?</b><br/></p>
<p>Glad you asked.  </p>
<p>These are not the cotton
or polyester socks you buy in 3-packs for 10 bucks.</p>
<p>LIFT23 socks are
performance socks designed to keep your feet super dry and extremely
comfortable when you are out breaking a sweat.  Our socks use a
proprietary merino wool blend designed to wick away moisture, keeping your feet
comfortable and dry in all climates. Naturally antimicrobial, these socks will
not stink!  Our socks have a no-rub seam at the toe and added
compression in the arch that ensures your socks don't slip, even during the
most rigorous of activities. You will notice a difference in feel
both when you put on the socks and eventually take them off (although you are
not going to want to). Did I mention they come in both traditional and
non-traditional colors and look damn nice? </p>

</div></div>","NEW PERK:Hats Off to our Vets! Say thank you to a Veteran by giving them a sweet lid and get yourself one for doing so.  Now that's a win-win! 



LIFT23 featured in Hackers Paradise     
""After several rounds and countless hours on the range it can confidently be said that the company’s claims are legit.""
Playing sports doesn't have to mean sweaty, smelly, blistering
feet.  The most comfortable, moisture-wicking, high
performance athletic sock you have been wishing and waiting for has arrived.
 But by discovering LIFT23's new athletic socks, you will do more than just
improve your round, your run, your game.  You will help share the joy of
sports with returning Veterans who have served our country.  





        
          
Let me explain.  LIFT23 is gearing up
to roll out our newest sock—a low rise athletic sock that can be used for a variety of activities such as golfing,  running,
tennis, and cycling.  And we are very excited to be teaming up with the amazing
PGA HOPE (Helping Our Patriots Everywhere) as our beneficiary. For
every pair of these LIFT23 socks purchased, we alternate between donating a
pair of socks to a Veteran recovering in a VA hospital, and donating a portion
of our profits to PGA HOPE.  PGA HOPE is a proven program that partners
with VA hospitals and uses golf as an activity to both assist veterans with
their progress in rehab and help them assimilate back into their community
through the social interaction the game provides.  





Even if you are short on time, I hope you will check out the video above, where you will hear Marine Corporal Chris Nowak tell you from the heart the impact PGA HOPE has on Veterans, and how excited he and the program are to be joining forces with LIFT23. 
SOUNDS GOOD, BUT
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT LIFT23's SOCKS?
Glad you asked.  
These are not the cotton
or polyester socks you buy in 3-packs for 10 bucks.
LIFT23 socks are
performance socks designed to keep your feet super dry and extremely
comfortable when you are out breaking a sweat.  Our socks use a
proprietary merino wool blend designed to wick away moisture, keeping your feet
comfortable and dry in all climates. Naturally antimicrobial, these socks will
not stink!  Our socks have a no-rub seam at the toe and added
compression in the arch that ensures your socks don't slip, even during the
most rigorous of activities. You will notice a difference in feel
both when you put on the socks and eventually take them off (although you are
not going to want to). Did I mention they come in both traditional and
non-traditional colors and look damn nice? 

Tested and reviewed by:

""I was given a pair of LIFT23 golf socks to try out. I have since replaced my sock drawer with LIFT23s.  You won't find a better sock"" - Jason Peterson (PGA Professional)

""Other than when I'm on the ropes, these are my go to socks when competing."" 



Pete Mongeau (Crossfit Competitor) 
""Super
impressed with how dry my feet were after the race""
-John Buzanga
(competitive cyclist)
WHY MERINO? 


""Wool
fiber has a higher vapor moisture absorbency than other natural fibers, such as
cotton, linen, and silk, and general synthetic fibers. It also has higher heat
releasing and heat absorption properties accompanying moisture absorption and
desorption respectively, which strengthens the buffering effect of the clothing
between the human body and the surrounding environment.""

- Liya Zhou Polytechnic University, Hong Kong; Xunwei Feng and Yan     feng  DuThe College of Textiles, DongHua University, Shanghai, China; Yi Li The Institute of Textile and Clothing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China

Don't synthetics do the job just as well?

Scientific tests
carried out by the Hohenstein Institute in Germany, the Ergonomics Unit at the
Polytechnic Institute of Wales, and the CSIRO in Australia support anecdotal
evidence that Superfine Merino provides the wearer with superior overall
climate control and moisture absorption than synthetics. 

Studies have also
confirmed that merino offers higher natural UV protection than many other
fibers including cotton.


Merino wool is well-known for keeping you warm in the cold, but
less well known as the ideal fabric for keeping you dry and cool in hot weather

The Bedouin tribes of
the Sinai, where temperatures reach extreme highs, have been wrapping
themselves in wool for centuries. 
The merino wool works as a condition buffer;
in the heat cooling the body initially through managing the build up of
moisture vapor internally, keeping the wearer drier for longer. 

Then, by not
clinging to the skin even when wet, the fabric allows the skin to
continue to do its
job through sweating and cooling the body.


WHY THE NEW SOCKS?  AND WHY AND HOW DID THE PARTNERSHIP WITH PGA HOPE COME ABOUT?    The great feedback we
received about our ski socks made us realize that people who engage in all type
of athletics should have the benefit of LIFT23 socks.  And with more
people wearing our socks, we knew we could make a bigger impact.   
Once we heard about PGA HOPE, we knew right away that we wanted this amazing program to be the beneficiary of our low rise athletic socks.  We had a
whirlwind of meetings, and a partnership was born.   After brainstorming, PGA HOPE and
LIFT23 agreed that we could best serve the Veterans as follows: 
for every pair of these socks purchased, LIFT23 will alternate between donating a
pair of socks to a Veteran recovering in a VA hospital, and donating a portion
of our profits to PGA HOPE. TELL
ME MORE ABOUT PGA HOPE AND THE PEOPLE IT SERVES 
PGA HOPE (Helping Our
Patriots Everywhere) is a year- round golf program for all military
Veterans, designed to enhance their rehabilitation and assimilation back into
society. The HOPE program provides all Veterans with FREE golf instruction
taught by local PGA Professionals.  As Chris explains in the video above, golf gives these men and women something else to focus on besides their daily mental and physical rehabilitation.  
Quick Facts

There are more than
     3 million disabled veterans in the U.S.
Over 300,000 active duty military have returned from Iraq, Afghanistan
     and other current conflicts with some form of disability 
Suicide
     is a major issue among military veterans; recent studies
     showing that 5000 to 8000 Veterans commit suicide each year (22 suicides a day)

Our goal is to build an excellent timepiece by our experienced professionals &amp; offer to end customer at affordable price. All <strong>Chronovisor</strong> products are creative, durable &amp; at highest quality standards. We stand firmly by our brand beliefs &amp; always provide the best after- sales service. </p><p><strong>2) What size is the watch? </strong></p><p>The case diameter is 43mm &amp; the thickness is 12.35mm </p><p><strong>3) What is the watch movement?</strong></p><p><strong>Chronovisor</strong> is set with Miyota 8218 automatic movement. It is small second function, 21,600 vibrations per hour and power reserved to 40+ hours. Miyota 8218 is a renowned automatic movement.</p><p><strong>4) Is it see through case back?</strong></p><p>Yes! It is open back design. Also sapphire crystal is used on case back for the best quality.</p><p><strong>5) Why use titanium case?</strong></p><p>Due largely to its rarity, Titanium is generally more expensive than other types of metals like steel, aluminium , iron...It is a kind of material which is hypoallergenic, non-magnetisable &amp; natural resistance to rust and corrosion. Titanium is among the strongest and most durable metals on the planet. It has the highest strength-to-density ratio of any metallic element on the periodic table. Each <strong>Chronovisor CVNM6102</strong> is equipped with Titanium case, in order to meet the highest standard of quality. </p><p><strong>6) What is the Super-LumiNova painting? </strong></p><p>Super-LumiNova is a kind of luminescent material. It is deposited on the inner bezel of <strong>Chronovisor</strong> CVNM6102, in order to read the indications in the obscurity. In general, this light emission is of photo luminescent (resulting from the absorption of light) Super-LumiNova is non-radioactive photoluminescent pigment. Its luminescence decreases with hours but it is restored as soon as the watch is exposed to bright light. As an average, Super-LumiNova can glow for approximately 8-10 hours at night. </p><p><strong>7) Is it screwed in crown?</strong></p><p>All <strong>Chronovisor</strong> timepieces are engineered with screwed in crowns. For watch adjustment, a crown is connected to the movement by the winding system. It is fitted inside with sealing ring that is pressed onto the threaded pipe of the watch case to ensure water resistance. The best water tightness is obtained by a screwed in crown that is pressed or screwed on to the case middle. </p><p><strong>8) What's about the rubber strap? </strong></p><p><strong>Chronovisor</strong> uses NBR (nitrile-butadiene rubber) strap. It is the most comfortable rubber strap on the market. NBR strap is very soft, stain resistant and very durable. While wearing, it does not pull hairs or attract lint. Compared to PU and Silicon, NBR strap is more expensive. It is the good way to go for swimming. NBR strap stands up very well to sun and salt, too. </p><p><strong>9) What's about the buckle? </strong></p><p>Unlike others, <strong>Chronovisor</strong> doesn't not use any OEM alloy buckle. The buckle of <strong>CVNM6102</strong> is made of stainless steel. It is designed specially for <strong>Chronovisor</strong> with its pioneering spirit. </p><p><strong>10) What's the package included? </strong></p><p>Each <strong>Chronovisor</strong> package includes a piece of CVNM6102, one extra rubber strap, 16G USB flash drive (user manual ) and guarantee card. </p><p><strong>11) What's about the USB flash drive? </strong></p><p>Our<strong> Chronovisor</strong> USB flash drive is custom made with beautiful design. Each round shaped piece is with 16GB memory and installed with CVNM6102 user manual. </p><p><strong>12) Does Chronovisor need battery? </strong><strong>What is automatic watch? How often should it be winding up ? </strong></p><p><strong>Chronovisor</strong> doesn't need any battery and it is powered by you. It is winding automatically. By rotating the ratchet wheel 7.5 times (turning the crown 40 times), the mainspring becomes fully winded for the 1st time wearing. Afterward, there's unnecessary to wind up again if keep wearing it. </p><p><strong>13) What is the warranty? </strong></p><p>We've got you covered! <strong>Chronovisor</strong> offers 2 years limited warranty. During the warranty period, the repair fee is free of charge. However, this warranty doesn't cover normal wear and tear or incidental damage. </p><p><strong>14) When should I pay the money?</strong></p><p>Your card will be charged as soon as the campaign has been officially funded and the time has run out on the campaign. You should see a charge on your account 3-5 days after the campaign ends. </p><p><strong>15) Is shipping charge included? </strong></p><p>Yes! The shipping charge is included to certain countries such as United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, France, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Netherlands, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan.

It is the most comfortable rubber strap on the market. NBR strap is very soft, stain resistant and very durable. While wearing, it does not pull hairs or attract lint. Compared to PU and Silicon, NBR strap is more expensive. It is the good way to go for swimming. NBR strap stands up very well to sun and salt, too. 9) What's about the buckle? Unlike others, Chronovisor doesn't not use any OEM alloy buckle. The buckle of CVNM6102 is made of stainless steel. It is designed specially for Chronovisor with its pioneering spirit. 10) What's the package included? Each Chronovisor package includes a piece of CVNM6102, one extra rubber strap, 16G USB flash drive (user manual ) and guarantee card. 11) What's about the USB flash drive? Our Chronovisor USB flash drive is custom made with beautiful design. Each round shaped piece is with 16GB memory and installed with CVNM6102 user manual. 12) Does Chronovisor need battery? What is automatic watch? How often should it be winding up ? Chronovisor doesn't need any battery and it is powered by you. It is winding automatically. By rotating the ratchet wheel 7.5 times (turning the crown 40 times), the mainspring becomes fully winded for the 1st time wearing. Afterward, there's unnecessary to wind up again if keep wearing it. 13) What is the warranty? We've got you covered! Chronovisor offers 2 years limited warranty. During the warranty period, the repair fee is free of charge. However, this warranty doesn't cover normal wear and tear or incidental damage. 14) When should I pay the money?Your card will be charged as soon as the campaign has been officially funded and the time has run out on the campaign. You should see a charge on your account 3-5 days after the campaign ends. 15) Is shipping charge included? Yes! The shipping charge is included to certain countries such as United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, France, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Netherlands, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan. For the rest of the world, the shipping fee is US$ 26 16) Can you guarantee the delivery dates? We've done our very best to demand and create a solid production plan. We are confident that we will meet our projected delivery dates. Should we miss projections, we'll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible. 17) Can you help further if I still have a question? No problem! Please submit your questions to info@chronovisor.ch for further resistance.  Risks and challengesChronovisor CVNM6102 is our first project on Indiegogo. We are experienced professionals in horology industry and work with world class manufacturing partners.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
I've been making and selling these 1"" round pin-back badges (buttons) for nearly ten years, just for some extra spending cash to supplement my disability allowance.  Unfortunately, in addition to many other physical ailments, I've been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and a ganglion cyst in my right wrist, and the circle-cutter I've used for years is now unusable to me --I can type with my splint, but I cannot operate the manual circle cutter, and using scissors or an X-Acto knife is too imprecise to be efficient (especially for such a small size).  I have found a graphic punch from the on-line store where I usually buy my badge parts, and it is significantly less than the minimum Indie Go-Go requires, but still out of my price range (about $200 after shipping).</div>

The Impact

When my wrists were still good, I provided badges at a bulk rate to local (and occasionally national and international) bands, vintage clothiers, art galleries, club nights and DJs, and even bloggers and podcasters.
Since the carpal tunnel syndrome has only been progressing in severity, I've had to turn down people who want badges.
If some-one goes some-where else for badges, this might not guarantee the same quality and fair pricing I can promise. 

My Etsy store is also impacted by this, as once I run out of designs I have plenty stock of from weekenders and other events (I will post my last ""New Design"" on 30 October 2012), my ability to make more in time to update the shop is anybody's guess.  My Etsy customers will be very sad and my ability to procure new customers will be reduced every week. :-(  Then eventually I'll completely run out of badges, and then I'll be sad. :-(

<p>Robby Brisco is currently a junior at Avon High School in Avon, CT and celebrated his sixteenth birthday back in November. He has been a member of the Avon High School soccer team for three years and he has also played on the AJAX premier team out of Bristol, CT for five years.</p>
<p>In early February of this year, Robby was diagnosed with desmoplastic small round cell tumor, an extremely rare form of childhood bone cancer. As of 2004, only two hundred cases have ever been described in medical literature and having this type of primary tumor in a bone has only been reported twice before Robby. He will have surgery later this year to remove part of his femur and his knee, as well as two surgeries to remove tumors which have already spread to his lungs. It is unlikely he will be able to play soccer or any other type of contact sport. Robby is a special kid.</p>
<p>Immediately after the cancer diagnosis, Robby began aggressive treatment. He has fourteen chemotherapy treatments scheduled about every two weeks, giving his body time to try and recover between treatments. These treatments are extremely costly and his family has dropped everything to support Rob through this fight. In fact, his two older brothers withdrew from college to be with him (you can see Robby and his brothers in the picture). His brothers played soccer at Avon High School for all four years and played on premier soccer teams too.</p>
<p>Our goal, through this tournament, is to help the Brisco family with costs of medical treatment, along with basic essentials. We want to show Robby that the soccer community is behind him! Therefore, we are dedicating our annual 4 v 4 tournament to Robby in his fight to “give cancer the boot”! Please support us in any way you can because we would love to give back to this loving family.</p>

</div></div>","Robby Brisco is currently a junior at Avon High School in Avon, CT and celebrated his sixteenth birthday back in November. He has been a member of the Avon High School soccer team for three years and he has also played on the AJAX premier team out of Bristol, CT for five years.
In early February of this year, Robby was diagnosed with desmoplastic small round cell tumor, an extremely rare form of childhood bone cancer. As of 2004, only two hundred cases have ever been described in medical literature and having this type of primary tumor in a bone has only been reported twice before Robby. He will have surgery later this year to remove part of his femur and his knee, as well as two surgeries to remove tumors which have already spread to his lungs. It is unlikely he will be able to play soccer or any other type of contact sport. Robby is a special kid.
Immediately after the cancer diagnosis, Robby began aggressive treatment. He has fourteen chemotherapy treatments scheduled about every two weeks, giving his body time to try and recover between treatments. These treatments are extremely costly and his family has dropped everything to support Rob through this fight. In fact, his two older brothers withdrew from college to be with him (you can see Robby and his brothers in the picture). His brothers played soccer at Avon High School for all four years and played on premier soccer teams too.
Our goal, through this tournament, is to help the Brisco family with costs of medical treatment, along with basic essentials. We want to show Robby that the soccer community is behind him! Therefore, we are dedicating our annual 4 v 4 tournament to Robby in his fight to “give cancer the boot”! Please support us in any way you can because we would love to give back to this loving family.

<h3>Dynamic Solar Time</h3>
<p>Just since the 14th century - with the invention and propagation of the mechanical clockwork - has a fixed determination of the hour to 60 minutes and the division of the minute into 60 seconds been defined. Dividing a day (sunrise to sunset) into twelve units (hours) already began several thousand years ago. Because the time between sunrise and sunset is longer in summer than in winter, the length of an hour varies according to the season. Thus in ancient Rome, the longest hour in a day took about 75 minutes while the shortest took approximately 45 minutes according to today's time</p>

<h3>The Ayurveda Aspect</h3>
<p>In the traditional Indian medicine of Ayurveda (»knowledge of life«, sanskrit: Ayus, Life und Vid, knowledge) day and night are divided into so-called doshas (essences). The »Kapha« dosha, for example, is present from 06:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m. This time corresponds to the attributes of the representative elements (earth and water): heavy, inactive, cold, moist, etc.</p>
<p>It can be assumed that the essences of a particular time of day are determined primarily by the sun. Therefore the culmination of the sun is analogous to the energetic maximum in our self. At midday the »Pitta« dosha (corresponding to fire, heat, etc.) is dominant. </p>
<p>The question is: »when is the middle of the day«?</p>
<p>The Ayurveda Sundial does not divide the day according to the »time zones«, but is based upon the position of the sun (local apparent time). Depending on the season, therefore, the first dosha may start at 7:50, and instead of the assumed four hours, it may laast only three hours. Or you may discover that midday seldomly arrives at 12:00, but rather that the high point of the sun and with it the height of the Pitta cycle sometimes may occur hours later.</p>

<p>One of the deciding factors why I began to develop the Ayurveda Sundial eight years ago, was that stupid idea of »Daylight Saving Time«. Although the time zone difference can have a more significant impact on the time structure, the time change in March and October is the most irritating.</p>
<p>The effect of the energy balance is controversial. The consequences are highly questionable.</p>
<p>However, as you probably expect, such time manipulations do not influence the Ayurveda Sundial. Even if the time zone time is changed, the solar time (local apparent time, LAT) remains the same. 12:00 noon solar time (ST) is midday. The sun always rises at 6:00 a.m. ST at the first sun hour and sets at 6:00 p.m. ST at the first night hour. They are just as reliable as the daily dosha cycles.</p>

With The Rosa Bag, you’ll feel good and look good while carrying everything you need in the most convenient, sustainable way.    Every Rosa Bag is made from one pound of recycled car glass from landfills, helping reuse an important source of waste that otherwise contaminates the planet. Compared to one traditional leather bag, we save 9.7 gallons of water and generate zero methane gas emissions!  Most vegan leather products are just plastic—they come from PU or PVC and aren’t truly eco-friendly, but not The Rosa Bag! There is no other vegan leather bag that is made from recycled car glass. This vegan leather’s extreme durability is what allows our bags to last a lifetime. And the best part? You can’t tell it’s recycled and you won’t believe it’s not leather!    Say goodbye to your receipt, hair tie and gift-card graveyard known as a purse!  The Rosa Bag carries 20 perfectly-organized pounds effortlessly so you never have to compromise on an ‘essential’ to stay stylish. Despite its large capacity, you never have to worry about it looking bulky.  It’s designed to look slim and sleek even while full!  It’s like a magician’s hat—it stays slim no matter how many essentials you put in!     No more digging for your keys, spilled water bottles or finding everything ‘floating’ in your bag. The Rosa Bag’s clever organization ensures you can carry everything you need and easily find it.    The Rosa Bag can be worn as a handbag, crossbody or backpack so you can transition seamlessly from work to the gym to nighttime chic!  When it comes to bags, you usually have to choose one per function: one handbag for work, one backpack for commuting on your bicycle and one crossbody for shopping or a night out. The Rosa Bag will be your last bag, because you can literally wear it every day, forever!      Handbag: Attach the rounded shoulder strap to each side of the bag using both clasps.  Backpack: Place the two flat adjustable straps on the back of the bag, attaching both straps to the top central loop, and then attaching the other side of each strap to one of the loops on the lower back sides. You can remove the rounded shoulder strap or leave it, as well.  Crossbody Bag: With just one of the flat straps, attach each side with the snaps to each of the side loops in the bag. Adjust the size by sliding the buckle.    The modern-day lifestyle is changing. We have to be conscious of our buying actions and the lines that used to separate our work lives from our social lives, from our family lives and so on, are blurry now and seem to disappear.   Unfortunately, the fashion industry hasn’t caught up yet—it’s rife with waste and full of trade-offs. If you want a vegan bag, it looks cheap and is made of plastic.  We need one bag that seamlessly transitions with our daily activities.   Its creation responds to the growing demand for fewer, better, long-lasting fashion items.  Pick the perfect Rosa Bag for you with 3 chic color options: Grey, Black or Cognac.   The Burgundy and Rose color options are achievements that can be unlocked and available by sharing this campaign on social media.A survey will be sent to all backers once the campaign completes which will allow you to select the color of your bag and the color of your ad-ons.   The large outer flap closes with a convenient snap button that keeps your bag completely closed in transit.  The Rosa Bag is handmade in Spain in a workshop that also manufactures bags for top tier European designer brands.  It’s not manufactured on an assembly line or made by machines, it’s actually handmade using traditional techniques that take a lot of time on each piece—going back to the basics of craftsmanship.   Look closely at details like the stitching and edge painting to see for yourself!   The Rosa Bag doesn’t have to be your last bag. It’s just likely you won’t need another bag for years—it’s that tough and versatile!   Carry your laptop, books and other business-y essentials and still look cute and stylish. Your Rosa Bag will keep everything organized so you can find your glasses, pen or headphones at a moment’s notice!   The Rosa Bag is tear-proof, water-resistant, stain-proof and scratch-proof, making it kid and pet-friendly.  The bag’s vegan leather exterior is so tough because car glass uses Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB). It’s a resin used for applications that require strong binding, like laminated glass in automobile windshields.  You’ll enjoy your Rosa Bag in top condition for years to come!  The Rosa Bag’s 3-way wearability means you can stay comfortable even if you’re on-the-go for hours. If your arm or shoulder gets tired carrying it one way, switch up the straps. Or if you need to carry more than usual, put your Rosa Bag in backpack mode to effortlessly carry up to 20 pounds!   Commuting through town? Put your Rosa Bag in backpack mode for maximum mobility and then stroll into work, school or wherever you are with a tasteful handbag fit for the runway.   No more pre-trip packing breakdowns, overweight baggage or broken suitcases—at least not due to multiple purses!  The Rosa Bag is 3 bags in 1 so you have maximum space for clothes, shoes and toiletries!  Concert, bar or birthday party—someone will notice your Rosa Bag. They may comment how high-end it looks or simply mention they like it. Either way, be prepared to share you have the first purse made of recycled car glass! ;)      We’re a small, women-owned business that makes stunning fashion products with kindness and care. While all our products benefit the environment and give back to those in need, The Rosa Bag is special.  Our core purpose is to provide women with beautiful fashion accessories that are socially and environmentally conscious, and set an example for sustainable fashion along the way. All our products are eco-friendly and vegan, and 10% of our profits go towards helping young women in Bogota, Colombia access education and develop leadership skills.                     We have worked extremely hard to make this product ready for full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what we see as the risks and our plan to assess them:MANUFACTURING: The manufacturer is lined up, and we have quality assurance people on site during production.FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things get a bit crazy and stuff happens that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. We are using an experienced logistics team to get our products to you. We’ll keep open and honest communication with you through our process so you know where your product is and when it’s going to get to you.",95.0,0,"1 Campaign

Quality is high, while prices stay fair. How so? We reach consumers around the world directly from the traditional workshops in the heart of France, cutting out any unnecessary middle-man”DEPANCEL is the contraction of Delage, Panhard and Facel Vega, illustrious jewels of the French industry. Our inspiration lies in their industrial vision, as well as in their ""Made in France"" to which they are closely linked. Industrial dynamics, accessibility and know-how: these are the three essential components of Depancel.   The AUTO 24H - 9120 has a 24H function. It single-hand at 6H on the dial shows a time display of 24H. This type of watch is used by military, astronauts or airline pilots, among others. They are particularly useful for those who cross different time zones in both directions or who are deprived of the view of the sun as a landmark.                                                                                   Our straps are handmade in France with bull leather. You will be able to choose from one of five straps after the campaign, if you want more than one strap just add 50€ per extra strap to your pledge!You can pick the strap of your choice:20mm straps matching our entire collectionsThis strap is made from high quality bull-skin here in the France. We designed these to be that ""all-purpose"" strap that goes with everything. These straps are a play on those amazing 1960s racer-style straps seen on the great timepieces of early Formula 1, but with an upgraded hide, increased durability and with a decidedly more aggressive look. Each Depancel Racing Strap is hand-made in France.These leather and tweed fabric straps were designed to bridge the gap between casual and dressy styles. This tweed pattern is inspired by vintage car seat and suit fabric. The leather lining ensures comfortable wear on the wrist.Have you noticed our signature? The tricolor stitches, a tribute to our French origins...Our straps width is  20/18mm with 9 holes. They fit 16 to 24 cm wrists perfectly and are available in three different colors: black, brown and tweed. Smooth Leather Watch PouchOur Smooth Leather Pouches are handmade in France with calf leather crust, and these are a great way to carry and protect a single watch. On the flap you will find our logo discreetly placed. Due to the unique nature of the materials used, and the human element of their construction, each pouch has a personality all its own.Leather Covered NotebookWe all love a good notebook, to save our next big ideas. Which is why we decided to create one with a calf leather crust cover handmade in France. You can see Depancel logo on the cover. Unlike many other notebooks, this one lies perfectly flat, so it's easy to carry it everywhere on your pocket.9 × 14 cm, 48 pages, Paper: 90g wood-free, Made In FranceOur company has been manufacturing watches since 2015, we have already sold and delivered several thousand watches under the brand KOPPO, with which we already made a Kickstarter campaign in 2016 (176k€ raised). This first experience allowed us to set up a solid supply chain, from production to delivery.WARRANTY:  We believe that our products should be built to last. That’s why every Depancel watch isguaranteed for life (except for the sapphire crystal glass and the strap). We are able to offer this guarantee because we source only the best available watch components and rigorously examine our watches at each step of production to ensure every timepiece shipped from our factory operates with flawless precision. SHIPPING:Depancel watches and accessories will be shipped worldwide from France. You may be responsible for taxes and duties applicable in your country. All our timepieces will be shipped in an oak wooden box: ESTIMATED DELIVERY:  We have spent more than one year working on and testing our prototypes to meet the qualifications we ourselves would expect from a Mechanical watch. With the solid experience we built we are confident that we will meet our projected delivery dates. We have built the schedule with our manufacturing partners to ship by the projected dates. Our manufacturers stand ready to activate production as soon as we meet our Kickstarter funding goal.  So we will start shipping the watches in September 2018. DO YOU NEED TO CONTACT US? You can ask us anything at help@depancel.comDiscover more pictures of our watches on our instagram :     La fabrication en France est au cœur de notre projet. Comment pouvons-nous vraiment vous proposer des produits d’une grande qualité fabriqués en France qui restent si accessibles ? C’est simple, nous distribuons nos produits directement sans intermédiaire.Depancel est la contraction de Delage, Panhard et Facel Vega, illustres fleurons de l’industrie française. Notre inspiration se trouve dans leur vision industrielle, ainsi que dans leur « Fabriqué en France » auquel elles sont étroitement liées. Dynamique industrielle, accessibilité et savoir-faire français : voilà les trois composantes essentielles de Depancel. À parts égales.                                                      Nous avons choisi de rendre hommage aux savoir-faire français à travers une première collection de montres inspirées de l’univers automobile, de son ancrage local, de la dynamique industrielle qu’elle a insufflé à la France entière il y a tout juste 100 ans.Le modèle AUTO 24H - 9120 possède une fonction 24H, mono aiguille qui permet un affichage du temps sur 24H afin de se situer immédiatement dans la journée. Les montres de ce type sont notamment utilisées par les militaires, les astronautes ou les pilotes de ligne. Elles se révèlent en effet particulièrement pratiques pour tous ceux qui traversent différents fuseaux horaires dans les deux sens ou qui sont privés de la vue du soleil comme point de repère.                                                                                    Nos bracelets sont fabriqués en France avec du cuir de taureau.

<li>You bump into someone while exiting the train, while another person reaches into your bag from behind.</li>
<li>Standing at a museum, you hear a little “click” from your purse, only to turn around and suddenly realize someone was standing a little too close.</li>
<li>The train comes to a stop and in the ensuing crowd you realize someone has grabbed your bag and is quickly leaving the station.</li>
<li>You’re standing in line and notice someone moving a strange device a little too close to your bag. Were they scanning your credit cards?</li>
</ul><p>We’ve designed a beautiful bag to combat these all-too common crimes, to ward off thieves and opportunists while providing an elegant and functional bag that’s perfect for travel or everyday use.</p><p>We’ve made our way through several bags that promised to protect our things, and they fall apart in a matter of months. Caught out in a sudden downpour? Everything in your bag soaked and damaged. And worst of all: over time the material rips and falls apart leaving you in a pickle.</p><p><strong>Not with the Arden Cove Anti-Theft Crossbody.</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475525942/olgjdotgqykumrcksl0m.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>Born out of necessity, the Arden Cove Anti-Theft Crossbody is a beautiful, functional, and sturdy day bag designed for the tasteful modern woman. With extreme attention to functionality and durability, the Anti-Theft Crossbody is made to not only protect your belonging from people who want to take it from you, but also withstand the climates and stress bags undergo while in everyday use or while traveling.</p><p>Arden Cove started with two sisters who wanted to make bags they couldn’t find on the market. Tired of poorly-made or cute-but-useless bags. We wanted bags that were beautiful and functional. Bags that would endure the abuse we put our belongings through day in and day out.</p><p>Over several months we’ve gone through many prototypes and iterations. We’ve refined our core vision for what the Anti-Theft Crossbody can be while also making something beautiful and functional suitable to a wide range of uses. All of this hard work and effort has led us to the bag you see here. The perfect companion for every-day use or the on-the-go traveler.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479596032/cvzdixmzjomii7fccj5a.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479596047/qyfmrvb9tpb8lhkhfc4a.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479596063/oty9hc8jrqm7lcwiibua.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475477872/m1sxhw23cdpwrl140yjm.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Every single feature you see on the Arden Cove Anti-Theft Travel Crossbody has been purposefully built and extensively tested for optimal functionality.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473460011/whpazevlqqqgfn5fgnjv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Full Body Anti-slash</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Most “Anti-theft” bags currently on the market are actually only anti-slash on the bottom portion of the bag. That doesn’t protect you if a thief is standing behind you on a crowded bus and decide to do a little digging with a pocket knife. While we still suggest you to keep your bag in front of you in crowded areas, even if you get a little distracted looking at the Mona Lisa, our bag is protected from all sides, so thieves can BACK OFF!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/mml4wYq.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Cut-proof strap</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Having a anti-slash body is no use if a thief just cuts the strap and makes off with the whole bag! Our strong, chainlink strap will deter thieves targeting purses with thin leather straps. The strap comes in two lengths: 18"", 20"", and 23"" drop length. See our chart below under ""Size Guide"" to figure out which length is perfect for you. </p><p><strong>Detachable Strap</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Strap also clips open so that you can wrap it around your chair at a restaurant or a pole on a train. That way they can’t grab or kick the bag. While it’s not a lock, thieves are looking for easy paydays, so if they see that your bag is attached, they’ll move on to an easier target.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/UksjEMD.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Lobster Clasp Zipper pulls</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sneaky little fingers might try to pull a zipper or two open. Our clip zippers will lock onto the metal clip, deterring potential thefts from trying to open your bag. Chose to use it all the time, or lock up when you’re in a crowded area.</p><p><strong>RFID protection</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The built in wallet provides RFID protection, which means that tech-savvy thieves won’t be able to pick up your private information with RFID readers.</p><p><strong>Waterproof Body &amp; Zippers</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Even if you’re caught in a sudden downpour in the middle of a rice paddy in Bali and still have to walk 30 minutes back to your hotel (true story), your valuables will be protected! Not just water resistant, our bag is 100% waterproof with a waterproof nylon exterior and waterproof zippers. So never fear a sudden change in weather, or you know, someone spilling their drink on you (also a true story).</p><p><strong>Comfortable Padded Strap</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The chain strap comes with a microfiber vegan leather pad for added comfort. Rather than transitioning the strap from chain to leather, which can be easily cut, the pad wraps around the chain. It is also adjustable up and down the chain to find a comfortable position for you.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/ZQOr0Uz.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Ample Storage for all your stuff</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The bag is sized to perfectly store all necessities, but also be non-invasive when out and about all day. See our “What Size to Choose” to see what works for you.</p><p><strong>Metal Studs Protect the Bottom </strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Full size crossbody will have 4 metal stud feet to protect the bottom of the bag from wear and tear when you set your bag down. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473452213/oj4fokh7lebbo0bjsyoz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473459425/vd5itxcp1rux2c2ejvsf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473450043/erumwqjwrg1zgyb1g0pz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473450311/kxavkjtbwnycz9txvbzg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475480036/xms6l2acfffvtezsjtad.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535046893/pzoxksoyjvusi6wdxean.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul><li>

We're cooking up some more bonus features & upgrades as thanks for helping us reach our stretch goals! ;) PERFECT FOR TRAVEL OR EVERYDAY While traveling, we’ve seen our fair share of crime on the road:
You bump into someone while exiting the train, while another person reaches into your bag from behind.
Standing at a museum, you hear a little “click” from your purse, only to turn around and suddenly realize someone was standing a little too close.
The train comes to a stop and in the ensuing crowd you realize someone has grabbed your bag and is quickly leaving the station.
You’re standing in line and notice someone moving a strange device a little too close to your bag. Were they scanning your credit cards?
We’ve designed a beautiful bag to combat these all-too common crimes, to ward off thieves and opportunists while providing an elegant and functional bag that’s perfect for travel or everyday use.We’ve made our way through several bags that promised to protect our things, and they fall apart in a matter of months. Caught out in a sudden downpour? Everything in your bag soaked and damaged. And worst of all: over time the material rips and falls apart leaving you in a pickle.Not with the Arden Cove Anti-Theft Crossbody.Born out of necessity, the Arden Cove Anti-Theft Crossbody is a beautiful, functional, and sturdy day bag designed for the tasteful modern woman. With extreme attention to functionality and durability, the Anti-Theft Crossbody is made to not only protect your belonging from people who want to take it from you, but also withstand the climates and stress bags undergo while in everyday use or while traveling.Arden Cove started with two sisters who wanted to make bags they couldn’t find on the market. Tired of poorly-made or cute-but-useless bags. We wanted bags that were beautiful and functional. Bags that would endure the abuse we put our belongings through day in and day out.Over several months we’ve gone through many prototypes and iterations. We’ve refined our core vision for what the Anti-Theft Crossbody can be while also making something beautiful and functional suitable to a wide range of uses. All of this hard work and effort has led us to the bag you see here. The perfect companion for every-day use or the on-the-go traveler.  Every single feature you see on the Arden Cove Anti-Theft Travel Crossbody has been purposefully built and extensively tested for optimal functionality.Full Body Anti-slashMost “Anti-theft” bags currently on the market are actually only anti-slash on the bottom portion of the bag. That doesn’t protect you if a thief is standing behind you on a crowded bus and decide to do a little digging with a pocket knife. While we still suggest you to keep your bag in front of you in crowded areas, even if you get a little distracted looking at the Mona Lisa, our bag is protected from all sides, so thieves can BACK OFF!Cut-proof strapHaving a anti-slash body is no use if a thief just cuts the strap and makes off with the whole bag! Our strong, chainlink strap will deter thieves targeting purses with thin leather straps. The strap comes in two lengths: 18"", 20"", and 23"" drop length. See our chart below under ""Size Guide"" to figure out which length is perfect for you. Detachable StrapThe Strap also clips open so that you can wrap it around your chair at a restaurant or a pole on a train. That way they can’t grab or kick the bag. While it’s not a lock, thieves are looking for easy paydays, so if they see that your bag is attached, they’ll move on to an easier target.Lobster Clasp Zipper pullsSneaky little fingers might try to pull a zipper or two open. Our clip zippers will lock onto the metal clip, deterring potential thefts from trying to open your bag. Chose to use it all the time, or lock up when you’re in a crowded area.RFID protectionThe built in wallet provides RFID protection, which means that tech-savvy thieves won’t be able to pick up your private information with RFID readers.Waterproof Body & ZippersEven if you’re caught in a sudden downpour in the middle of a rice paddy in Bali and still have to walk 30 minutes back to your hotel (true story), your valuables will be protected! Not just water resistant, our bag is 100% waterproof with a waterproof nylon exterior and waterproof zippers. So never fear a sudden change in weather, or you know, someone spilling their drink on you (also a true story).Comfortable Padded StrapThe chain strap comes with a microfiber vegan leather pad for added comfort. Rather than transitioning the strap from chain to leather, which can be easily cut, the pad wraps around the chain. It is also adjustable up and down the chain to find a comfortable position for you.Ample Storage for all your stuffThe bag is sized to perfectly store all necessities, but also be non-invasive when out and about all day. See our “What Size to Choose” to see what works for you.Metal Studs Protect the Bottom The Full size crossbody will have 4 metal stud feet to protect the bottom of the bag from wear and tear when you set your bag down. 
Dimensions:

Full: L: 8.5”, H: 6.5”, W: 2.5”

Mini: L: 6.5”, H: 4.5”, W: 2.25”

 The best way to determine the length for you is to take a crossbody you already love the length of on you. Then measure it from the top of the center of the bag to the apex of the strap when taught. Here is a general height guide, but of course, you are welcome to pick the length you prefer since everyone has different preferences!Click here for more for images of both Full Size and Mini size bags on a 18"", 20"", and 23"" drop length chain strap on models at various heights.   Below you can find all the specs for the Anti-Theft Travel Crossbody.If there is a spec that you don't see, you can always contact us for more information.

<h3>Because you can't kill NJ</h3>
<p>Love NJ? Love Zombies? Love clothes?</p>
<p>WELL HAVE I GOT A TEE SHIRT FOR YOU. </p>
<p>This design raised a net of $800 in donations after Hurricane Sandy rocked the great state of NJ, and now I'd like to make it available as a t-shirt. </p>
<p>My plan is to print 50 in this nice off-white cream color, and 50 on black tees. </p>
<p>You can never have too many black tee shirts, right?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I need to make this happen and what you'll get for helping:</h3>
<p>In short, while I wish my funds to create beautiful merch were endless, they're not. I need a leg-up to get this full-color, gorgeous graphic printed in time for Memorial Day down the shore. </p>
<p>I've included a complex list of tiers for contributors with some FANTASTIC perks!</p>
<p>I understand that times are tough - why do you think I'm crowdsourcing my tee shirts? If you can't contribute, be the wonderful human being that I know you are, and share the link to this project with your horde of salivating zombie-obsessed geek friends. </p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">We're Forever in Black, and we've been trading in the NE of England for 15 years, making bespoke and period reproduction garments.</span></h3>
<p>However, the fashion market is changing, and we want to change with it. We'd like to launch a ready-to-wear line, and where better than at Newcastle Fashion Week, 11-19th May 2013.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Launching a ready-to-wear line is expensive, and the main expense is fabric. The bulk of funds raised will go towards buying fabrics to make the ready-to-wear line. We intend on making 10 garments for men and 10 for women, and we will need to have these available in multiple sizes. So we need to raise a LOT of money for fabric.</p>
<p>We will also spend a portion of the money raised on eco-friendly packaging for storage and sending of the garments, and on printed tags and bags.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to purchase some specialist display equipment to show our garments to their best advantage.</p>
<p>In return, we will write everyone who contributes a thank-you letter by hand. We will also offer a range of perks from goodie bags to an entire couture outfit made to your measurements. You'll get to see the collection before it premieres; you will even be able to have custom sized versions of our garments, something we will not offer after the collection is launched.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We will be taking what has essentially been a cottage industry to a competitor in the fashion market. This is ambitious, but we feel we're able to do this. It will allow us to support other UK businesses, many of them small, historic companies. We hope, in the long run, to be able to take on employees and do a small bit towards reviving the garment industry in the NE, which has long been in decline.</p>

<p>At Innovus Designs Inc, we have designed many products in the consumer electronics and soft goods industries.  Our experience in product design includes automotive, aircraft, consumer electronics, solar, and soft goods (backpacks) products.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>
<p>The inspiration for our solar backpack came during a day on the beach.  Everyone was basking in the sun, talking on their cell phones, listening to music, and having a great time.  I noticed that everyone was carrying a backpack or some kind of beach bag.  I also noticed that many people were worried about their cell phones and MP3 players.  The worry was not about the quality of service or quality of the device, it was about their batteries running out of juice.  Instead of running back to their cars to re-charge their phones, why not harness the power of the sun.  We decided to integrate the solar panels to a common backpack for a seamless, portable charging source.  We were awarded a US Patent for the idea of a solar backpack!</p>
<p><img alt=""Front Back"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i199.photobucket.com/albums/aa223/solargear/Trekker/Trekker-Duo_lr.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Front Back""/></p>
<p><strong>Benefit</strong></p>
<p>When you look around, almost everyone carries a backpack or messenger bag of some kind, and everyone carries some kind of personal, mobile electronic device (cell phone, MP3 player, GPS, etc…).  The mobile electronics on the market today (iPhones, iPads, smart phones, and tablets) require a considerable amount of power to operate during a full day.  With one of our solar backpacks, you can now charge your device, extend the battery life, and increase the actual usage time of your mobile electronics.  You also have a portable power source while hiking, camping, biking, spending time outdoors, out in remote areas, or even in emergency situations.</p>
<p> </p>

<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""> </p>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>The Trekker Solar Backpack is designed using high quality, durable materials including; 1000D Cordura, YKK zippers, and other quality hardware to withstand the everyday rugged handling that a backpack is exposed to.  We also use recycled materials when available.  We are using a state-of-the-art, thin-film panel that offers flexibility, high power output, and is perfect for integrating to the fabric of a backpack or carry case.  This solar panel has proven to be very durable (as shown in our video).  We have shot it with a pistol and run over it with a vehicle and it is still performing at peak power.  If you need an emergency source of solar power, the Trekker Solar Backpack can take a beating and still perform!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""> </p>
<p>This new backpack has a single USB port with an output of 500mA, equal to the power output of the USB2 port on your computer or laptop!  No need to wait for days to charge your device!  The solar panel output is strong and reliable.</p>
<p><img alt=""USB Port"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i199.photobucket.com/albums/aa223/solargear/Trekker/USB_phone_LR.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""USB Port""/>  <img alt=""Tablet Pocket"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i199.photobucket.com/albums/aa223/solargear/Trekker/Tablet_Pocket_LR.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Tablet Pocket""/></p>

<p><strong>Power Packs</strong></p>
<p>The Power Packs can serve as extra storage for the energy produced by the solar panel.  You can keep charging the Power Pack from the solar panel or charge it from the USB port on your computer.  This insures that you will have extra power even when there is no sun.  The Power Packs included with the Trekker Backpack come in two sizes:</p>
<p>Power Pack</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacity - 5000mAh</li>
<li>Output - Single USB port, 1000mA</li>
<li>Input - mini USB</li>

<li>Output - USB1 - 1000mA; USB2 - 2000mA</li>
<li>Input - mini USB</li>
</ul><p>Please note:  The exact specifications might change as we finalize the design and procurement of the battery packs.</p>
<p><strong>How you can help</strong></p>
<p>Bringing an idea to production takes time and capital.  Setting up production takes a proper facility, manufacturing equipment, raw material inventory, and manpower.  Your donations can help us meet the minimum order quantity for the solar panels, order raw material for the backpack, and align our resources to start our first round of production.</p>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What can I charge?</em></strong></p>
<p>- You can charge any mobile electronic device that uses a USB charging source.  This includes our Portable Powerpacks, iPhones, iPads, smart phones, tablets, GPS units, MP3 players, etc...</p>
<p><strong><em>How much power does the solar panel put out?</em></strong></p>
<p>- The solar panel is regulated at 5.5V (standard USB) with 500mA of current (equal to the power output of a USB port on your computer or laptop.)  Peak power output for the panel is 3.5 Watts.</p>
<p><strong><em>How long does it take to charge a phone?</em></strong></p>
<p>- Your phone (or other device) will have the same charge times as stated from the manufacturer of your device charging from a USB2 port.  Of course, the more sun, the better.  For example, in full sun a phone could charge in as little as 2 hours.  In partial sun, it could take 4 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Can I charge iPhones and iPads?</em></strong></p>
<p>- Yes, you can charge iPads, iPhones, and iPods directly from the solar panel or from one of our Portable Powerpacks.  Apple charging cords are recommended.</p>
<p><strong><em>How long will the solar panel last?</em></strong></p>
<p>- The solar panels are warranted to perform within 80% of the specified power output for 3 years.  The solar panel can actually last for 15+ years!</p>
<p><strong><em>How durable is the solar panel?</em></strong></p>
<p>- The panels are waterproof and can take a considerable amount of abuse.  As seen from our video, it can take bullet holes and can be run over by a car and still produce power!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Cannes Film Festival</strong> - This show alone receives close to 30,000 people in attendance annually. As if the numbers were not enough, of those 30,000 attendance, many high profile celebrities also attend this event. The 2016 lineup of personalities included Blake Lively, Ryan Gosling, Kendall Jenner, and Amal &amp; George Clooney to name a few. Exposure at this level makes it likely that we will later have the opportunity to dress one of these celebrities in the near future. Do you see where we’re going with this?</p>
<p><strong>Cannes Fashion Show</strong> - This Fashion show is an exclusive invitation that comes only once in a lifetime. If we showcase our designs this year, it means we will have the option, in subsequent years return to the show and become a part of this globally recognized community of artists.</p>
<p><strong>Production</strong> -</p>
<p>One valuable lesson we learned after showing in New York Fashion Week was that demand WILL come. The exposure after our NY show extended far beyond the runway into magazines in Italy and France, hence the reason we are extended the invitation to be a part of Cannes Film Festival today. Shows like these open so many opportunities that we must be prepared.</p>
<p>Part of the fundraised dollars will be allocated to put our designs into production so that after the show we can meet the demand of the customers to come and grow our brand. We are selling off all things on the DiDomenicodesign.com website that are not “in house” DiDomenico label so that by Fall 2017 we will be completely operable as an atelier only selling and designing DiDomenico Couture.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Designer Partnerships</strong>: In November 2016 DiDomenico visited Cuba and presented as the first American designer to showcase in Havana since 1960.</p>
<p>Following our debut we have formed a strong relationship with the Cuban fashion industry and will now exclusively sell designs by Mario Freixas and Pavel Alonzo. This will be their first introduction ever into the American market.</p>
<p>As DiDomenico continues to cross country lines and collaborate with designers from different countries, our online store will become the leader in authentically sourced and curated clothing from designers around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion</strong> - A big part in expanding our brand is first creating brand awareness. Through our current marketing efforts we have reached brides from Nashville to California and in between. These marketing dollars are needed to implement our new marketing strategy necessary to have DiDomenico recognized as an elite high-end brand.</p>
<h3>The $40k Breakdown</h3>
<p>There are the MANY ways that this DiDomenico fundraiser IS possible</p>

<p>Prom is in May! Not to far away and we have SO many gowns to choose from.

You can see a bit of my journey <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sewingtheworld/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Even with all these amazing photos there are still so many more portraits I have captured that the world has yet to see, so I decided to create a Sewing the World coffee table book. This is a 50 page 8” x11” book complete with high-resolution images and short stories of my travels and the first of its kind. Take a <a href=""http://www.didomenicodesign.com/france"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><u>sneak peek</u></i></a> here of the first couple pages in this amazing visual narrative.</p> <p><strong>These are just 4 examples!

<p><strong>Do you Drink Coffee?</strong></p>

<h3>About DiDomenico</h3>
<p>DiDomenico translates to “ The Lord’s Day”</p>
<p>Di·do·me·ni·co translates to “ The Lord’s Day”</p>
<p>This was the original Italian surname of Kelsy’s family until it was later americanized to “Dominick”. Because of her deep roots in her italian heritage, DiDomenico prides themselves on craftsmanship and authenticity.</p>
<p>The DiDomenico Logo was later created from her 94 year old Italian Grandmother’s signature.  </p>
<h3>A Little More about Me</h3>
<p>I’ve always been passionate about designing. Learning to sew at the age of nine, I’ve been designing in one way or another for the past 15 years. Two years ago I started DiDomenico Design and since that time it has been a whirlwind of amazing experiences and successes. I travel the world in search of unique fabrics (<strong><a href=""http://www.sewingtheworld.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sewingtheworld.org</a></strong>) and bring them back to my studio in order to create truly unique and one of a kind pieces for my clientele.</p>
<p>In two years we have graced the runway of New York Fashion Week, Couture Fashion Week and recently premiered as the <strong><a href=""http://us.fashionnetwork.com/news/First-American-designer-shows-in-Cuba-after-end-of-embargo,761398.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">First American Designer to showcase in Cuba</a></strong> since the embargo was put in place in 1960. As a result of these amazing mile markers we received an exclusive invitation to showcase our designs on one of the largest fashion platforms in the world: Cannes Film Festival.</p>
<h3>Why Come to Indigogo?</h3>
<p>Part of the whole idea of DiDomenico is thinking outside the box and looking at what's next. What is the future of fashion, and how will cultural exchange play into that?</p>
<p>With Indigogo, not only can I give women beautifully designed dresses but also the most unique custom designs found anywhere in the world. I get this unique opportunity to connect directly with women around the world and build a community of authentically crafted couture.</p>
<p>Moreover, in keeping with DiDomenico values, the France collection will be manufactured in the USA right here in our studio.</p>
<p><strong>What Happens at the End of This Campaign?</strong></p>
<p>A successful DiDomenico Indigogo campaign means we can showcase our line in front of thousands of the industry’s leaders and headline in one of fashion’s most respected events, Cannes Film Festival.</p>
<p>The funds raised will not only allow us to showcase in Cannes Film Festival but also cover production costs in order to meet the demands of designs that come after the event. It also means I can start designing and producing the next DiDomenico collection that I plan to launch in Fall 2017.</p>
<p><strong>What is Cannes Film Festival</strong></p>
<p>The Cannes Festival, named until 2002 as the International Film Festival (Festival International du film) and known in English as the Cannes Film Festival, is an annual film festival held in Cannes, France, which previews new films of all genres, including documentaries, from all around the world. Founded in 1946, the invitation-only festival is held annually (usually in May) at the <strong><a href=""http://en.palaisdesfestivals.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Palais des Festivals et des Congrès</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>How to Order </h3>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Fulfillment + Delivery</strong></p>
<p>As an designer, I'm very aware of the challenges associated with manufacturing. I have a able bodied team of seamstresses that are helping DiDomenico in our studio for this campaign and perfecting custom design orders. In addition to this I have contracted some of the country's most reputable factories to ensure that our new collection preview date for Fall 2017 are met and fulfilled on time. Production and shipping dates will also be dependent on how quickly backers return ordering information, but I've built in extra time for information collection to guard against delays. If a high volume of orders or other unforeseen circumstances arise that may cause delays, I will communicate directly with all my backers and work to fix the problem. My customers' happiness and enjoyment of this experience is most important to me.</p>
<p><strong>Exchange Policy</strong></p>
<p>If you're not happy with your clothing purchase you will be able to exchange it for a different size. If we don't have the same item available in your size, we will work with you to get you a comparable item that you love!</p>

</div></div>","What We Need & What You Get
Cannes Film Festival - This show alone receives close to 30,000 people in attendance annually. As if the numbers were not enough, of those 30,000 attendance, many high profile celebrities also attend this event. The 2016 lineup of personalities included Blake Lively, Ryan Gosling, Kendall Jenner, and Amal & George Clooney to name a few. Exposure at this level makes it likely that we will later have the opportunity to dress one of these celebrities in the near future. Do you see where we’re going with this?
Cannes Fashion Show - This Fashion show is an exclusive invitation that comes only once in a lifetime. If we showcase our designs this year, it means we will have the option, in subsequent years return to the show and become a part of this globally recognized community of artists.
Production -
One valuable lesson we learned after showing in New York Fashion Week was that demand WILL come. The exposure after our NY show extended far beyond the runway into magazines in Italy and France, hence the reason we are extended the invitation to be a part of Cannes Film Festival today. Shows like these open so many opportunities that we must be prepared.
Part of the fundraised dollars will be allocated to put our designs into production so that after the show we can meet the demand of the customers to come and grow our brand. We are selling off all things on the DiDomenicodesign.com website that are not “in house” DiDomenico label so that by Fall 2017 we will be completely operable as an atelier only selling and designing DiDomenico Couture.
Cultural Designer Partnerships: In November 2016 DiDomenico visited Cuba and presented as the first American designer to showcase in Havana since 1960.
Following our debut we have formed a strong relationship with the Cuban fashion industry and will now exclusively sell designs by Mario Freixas and Pavel Alonzo. This will be their first introduction ever into the American market.
As DiDomenico continues to cross country lines and collaborate with designers from different countries, our online store will become the leader in authentically sourced and curated clothing from designers around the world.
Promotion - A big part in expanding our brand is first creating brand awareness. Through our current marketing efforts we have reached brides from Nashville to California and in between. These marketing dollars are needed to implement our new marketing strategy necessary to have DiDomenico recognized as an elite high-end brand.

</p><p><b>The
Brand</b></p>
<p>The Inspired
Life brand and trademark represents the inspirational cycle between the
altruistic consumer and the benefitting child and cause. Simply put, “be
inspired and inspire others…it happens.”<span> 
This cycle is reflected in our logo with a backwards ‘D’ enabling the
logo to be read either Inspire or Inspired. </span></p>
<p>The
potential is huge! Really, it’s 5x the change:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><b><u>CHARITY</u></b>:
Donation to your choice charity furthering positive worldwide impact!</p></li>
<li><p><b><u>CHILD</u></b>:<span>  Palpable hope and gratitude along with a
priceless smile from hospitalized child!</span></p></li>
<li><p><b><u>YOU</u></b>:<span>  Look great, Inspire yourself, inspire a
child’s life &amp; change the world!</span></p></li>
<li><p><b><u>ECO-FRIENDLY</u></b>:<span>  We are environmentally friendly and
recycle our products!</span></p></li>
<li><p><b><u>COMMUNITY</u></b>:
Inspired sponsored charity events in your city, benefitting your community!</p></li>
</ol><p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Inspired
Life was forged of 4 innate desires/qualities in founder, Shaen Inglis – a
serial entrepreneur masquerading as a corporate fellow. </p>
<p>First,
was to do something more with my life that would leave a legacy of positive
change on this planet. Secondly, due to life experiences in my own childhood, I
truly desire to protect and help children. Thirdly, I generally refer to my
creative attention to detail as a positive attribute, while others close to me
might say it’s an obsessive compulsion for perfection.<span>  Lastly, I truly need to stop eating so many
milkshakes and go for a run instead!  I
had been wearing a rubber band on my wrist to serve as a constant reminder to
inspire myself to just be better.  </span></p>
<p>If
you mash all of that together, you get Inspired Life, an apparel company with a
business model to “be inspired and inspire others.” </p>
<p>It
has been said that one person is but a drop of water, but together, we are an
ocean (Satoro).<span>  Together we can be an
ocean of change and the Inspired Life company is the conduit by which we can
affect that change. </span></p>
<p><strong><u>The Perks</u></strong></p>
<p>A
successful campaign will result in the launch of our patent pending Inspired
wristbands and Men’s and Women’s Sport ¼ Zip Pullovers. It will also provide
the launching pad to a greatly expanded product offering on website following
the crowdfunding event along with the scheduling of our first charity
fundraisers, perhaps in your city.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/379629/files/20140219043157-Perks.gif?1392813117"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p><strong><u>FAQ’s</u></strong></p>
<p><b>How
can I confirm my donation was actually made? </b>You will be provided a tracking number with
your purchase that can be crosschecked with the donation payments made to the
charity.<span>  We make donation payments on a
quarterly basis.</span></p>
<p><b>You
did not take my shirt size or wristband size?</b><span>  Apparel sizing will be taken at the
conclusion of the event, as well as, wristband sizes. </span></p>
<p><b>I
wasn’t able to provide my color choices for bands and/or shirt? </b>Color
selections will be taken at the conclusion of the event.  However, we'll email you prior to the conclusion of this event to record your color choices. </p>
<p><b>How
much is donated per item?</b> For this event 10% of each items sales price will be donated to charity at our funding goal of $75,000 and above.  If we do not reach our funding goal we will still donate 3% of all revenues received through 4/1/14.  However, following this event, we will return to our standard 25% of sales price and 10% of sales price donated to charity on wristbands and all other apparel/gear, respectively. <span>This does not include the cost to produce and send the
Inspired Child’s wristband.  </span>This high of a donation percentage
off of the top line is basically unmatched in retail. Typical donations average
1%-5% at other retailers.<span>  Further, the
majority of other retailers make donations to their causes and often off of the
bottom line. Compared to similar bands, Inspired wristbands donation is over 800% greater, translating into over 8x the positive change. </span></p>
<p><b>Do
the bands have negative ions or magnets or holograms?</b><span>  No. 
Research has concluded that this “technology” simply does not work any
better than a control group.  However,
the research has also concluded that the bracelets themselves actually create a
placebo effect that can positively influence the wearer’s mood or
performance.  That is the “science”
behind the Inspired Wristbands as well. 
The wearer is constantly reminded of the good they’ve done through
buying the wristband and further, the wearer is reminded constantly to be
inspired to enjoy and appreciate life or whatever inspiration the band
represents to each individual.</span></p>
<p><b>Can
I buy additional lower band colors (Sports Band)?</b>
Yes.<span>  Additional lower band colors are
available for purchase now and on the website following this event.  They can be bought individually or in packs
of 5. </span></p><p><span>
</span></p><p><b>Can I buy
additional upper band colors (Sports Band)? </b>No.<span>  At the present time we are offering the light
and dark grey upper bands only.  Special
events in the future will likely make additional colors available on the
website.</span></p><p><span>
</span></p><p><b>What about the children’s
band:</b>  Every item purchased triggers
the gift of an Inspired children’s band specifically designed for hospitalized
children to inspire and encourage them and their families.  The bands feature the lion, the feet and the
inspired logo that represent their strength, journey and triumph, respectively.
The inner part of the band features the word Inspired in Braille for vision
impaired children.  The bands are
distributed nationally to a hospitalized child in one of the 170 Children’s
Miracle Hospitals Network. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What
are wristband sizes and dimensions? </b>The wristbands are available in three sizes:
Small/Medium, Large and Extra-Large. Our Small/Medium size wristband is
approximately 7"" or 180 mm circumference and is generally a good fit for
kids, women, and smaller men. Our Large size wristband is approximately 8""
or 203 mm circumference and is our average adult size. Our Extra-Large size
wristband is approximately 9"" or 227 mm circumference. Streamlined Band’s measure
12 mm (0.47 in) width x 2 mm (0.07 in) thickness. Sports Band’s measure 18 mm (0.70 in) width x
4 mm (0.15 in) thickness. <span><br/></span></p>
<p><b>What
color and size is the sticker?</b> The Inspired Sticker is
made of vinyl, is white in color and is approximately 4.25” x 1”.<span>  Perfect size for cell phone covers, water
bottles, computers, etc. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/378136/files/20140218112420-Sticker.gif?1392751460"" src="""" style=""width: 235.2px; height: 147px;""/></p><p></p><p><span>
</span></p><p><b>Do
warranties exist?</b><span> 
Yes.  The LCD Stripe has a one
year warranty against manufacturer defect. 
The Inspired Wristbands have a 90 day warranty against manufacturer
defects.  </span></p>
<p><b>When
can I expect my items to be delivered?</b><span>  We know you want to wear your Inspired gear
as soon as possible.  That’s why we’ve
already begun the process.  At this time
we expect delivery of the wristbands to be in May and the delivery of the apparel to be in August. Primarily due to time it takes to
manufacture the tools that ultimately produce our wristbands and LCD watches
given they are unique items.  All items
must make a transatlantic boat ride as well. 
</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Tell me again, how does it work?</b> With every item purchased <b>2</b> events happen:</p><p><em>First:</em> A pre-determined monetary contribution is made to the charity of your choosing.  We all have different passions and your contributions should support the causes that inspire you. </p><p>How does that work?</p><p>We’ve defined 4 key non-profit categories: Environment; Health; Humanitarian; and Children. It’s simple really, on our website either express checkout and choose one of our preferred non-profits, or search for a particular non-profit within each category, perhaps a food pantry or boys and girls club in your community or search for leukemia or water pollution– you name it – if the charity is a legitimate 501(c)(3) organization, it can be added to our catalog.  The consumer will be given a tracking number to confirm the donation with the charity on a quarterly basis. </p><p><i>Again, please note that for this event, all donations will benefit a children's hospital. Items bought on the website after this event will be available to choose other charities. </i></p><p><em>Second: </em>With every item purchased, a child in the hospital receives a specially designed Inspired wristband featuring the feet and the lion which represent their journey and strength, respectively.  Also, each child will receive a letter of encouragement on your behalf which you can choose to be personalized from you or keep it anonymous.</p><br/><p></p><p></p></div>","Come for the CAUSE, stay for the QUALITY:We are excited to introduce our Men’s and Women’s Sport ¼ Zip Pullovers as well as our patent pending Inspired wristbands and LCD Digital watch attachment (see above pictures). Inspired branded apparel and gear is innovative, of the highest quality and made with premium technical materials, but they are really so much more.  They are a conduit to a better you, a better us and a better world.How: Every item purchased automatically triggers a monetary contribution to the charity of your choice AND a hospitalized child receives a one-of-a-kind inspirational gift and letter of encouragement on your behalf. For Example: You purchase a wristband and a pullover, then you choose the charity, e.g. the World Food Program, to receive a monetary donation from your purchase and two hospitalized children receive a gift and letter. We need your help to make the Inspired Life vision a reality. We’ve worked vigorously for the last year building strong relationships with designers, suppliers, manufacturers, logistics, quality control, filing patents/trademarks, all in an effort that we can be ready to deliver the best quality products to you and together we can deliver inspiration to you and the world. The Cause:We’ve identified 4 key charity categories under which all verified charities will be eligible to receive the donation. If you can’t find the charity of your choice, we can add it after confirming the entity’s good standing as a 501 (c)(3) corporation. In ADDITION to a monetary donation above, for every ITEM purchased we will send one wristband and card to a hospitalized child. That is tangible, palpable change – a real life touched and inspired specifically because of you. The child will continue to be encouraged every time they look at their wrist, and it will be because of you.Below are examples of just how easy it is to make a HUGE impact.  For this event, for reasons of simplicity, all donations will benefit our preferred children’s charity. Protecting and caring for children is always a fantastic cause.  My son was treated at a children's hospital and I care deeply about their cause and am grateful for it. Please note, you will be able to choose your charity for items purchased through the website following this event. Impact Goals:Our goal from this event is to produce and deliver 5,000 children’s Inspired wristbands of strength to hospitalized children across the country, many of whom are fighting for their lives. That will also translate into of thousands of dollars in charitable donations – it just depends on you!What your giving will power:Contributions from this event will help us finance the following:
Donations:  First and foremost, the donation is made. At our funding goal and above we will donate 10% of total revenues.  If we do not reach our funding goal, we will still donate 3% of all revenues received through 4/1/14.  

Manufacturing:  

These wristbands have never existed before and require unique steel tools to be manufactured in order to produce each of the wristband designs and sizes (7 total at this time). 
Similarly, the LCD digital watch has been specifically engineered as an attachment for the Inspired Sports Band and requires one of a kind tooling.
Final apparel patterns, branded fabric, notions, grading and quality control.


Production:  All of the pieces are in place, from design to manufacturing to QC. We now just need your help to move forward with our foundational production runs. 
Marketing/Product:  Depending on the success of the campaign, we are hopeful that we can launch a marketing campaign to get the Inspired brand to a larger audience, as well as, expand our product offering significantly.  Translation – we expand our ability to effect positive change in our own lives, our community, and this planet.

manufactured out of aluminum, is water resistant and comes in multiple
colors.  The timepiece features a striking
blue back light and features date and stopwatch functionality. The LCD watch measures
approximately 7/8 in. x 1/2 in. with a 4mm thickness. Stripes:
Both bands have the ability to endlessly
interchange what we call Stripes. Every band comes with Stripes matching
the lower band (Sports Band) or opposite color (Streamline).  
Additional Stripes are available
on the website in various colors, as well as, in imprinted sets of six words in
related groupings. For example the ‘Meditation” set comes with six word Stripes
‘Serenity,’ ‘Listen,’ ‘Focus,’ ‘Energy,’ Clarity,’ ‘Faith.’ We also offer a
larger Stripe that can be imprinted with pertinent medical information, etc. The
possibilities are endless for the stripes allowing wearers to completely
personalize their Inspired wristbands to what is meaningful and inspiring to
them. You can interchange colors to support different sports teams or
school colors.


The Inspired Wristbands and Stripes are made of medical
grade silicone.  The Inspired Wristbands
are designed at Inspired Life’s headquarters in Parker, CO and manufactured in

The
Brand
The Inspired
Life brand and trademark represents the inspirational cycle between the
altruistic consumer and the benefitting child and cause. Simply put, “be
inspired and inspire others…it happens.” 
This cycle is reflected in our logo with a backwards ‘D’ enabling the
logo to be read either Inspire or Inspired. 
The
potential is huge! Really, it’s 5x the change:

CHARITY:
Donation to your choice charity furthering positive worldwide impact!
CHILD:  Palpable hope and gratitude along with a
priceless smile from hospitalized child!
YOU:  Look great, Inspire yourself, inspire a
child’s life & change the world!
ECO-FRIENDLY:  We are environmentally friendly and
recycle our products!
COMMUNITY:
Inspired sponsored charity events in your city, benefitting your community!
Our Story
Inspired
Life was forged of 4 innate desires/qualities in founder, Shaen Inglis – a
serial entrepreneur masquerading as a corporate fellow. 
First,
was to do something more with my life that would leave a legacy of positive
change on this planet. Secondly, due to life experiences in my own childhood, I
truly desire to protect and help children. Thirdly, I generally refer to my
creative attention to detail as a positive attribute, while others close to me
might say it’s an obsessive compulsion for perfection.  Lastly, I truly need to stop eating so many
milkshakes and go for a run instead!  I
had been wearing a rubber band on my wrist to serve as a constant reminder to
inspire myself to just be better.  
If
you mash all of that together, you get Inspired Life, an apparel company with a
business model to “be inspired and inspire others.” 
It
has been said that one person is but a drop of water, but together, we are an
ocean (Satoro).  Together we can be an
ocean of change and the Inspired Life company is the conduit by which we can
affect that change. 
The Perks
A
successful campaign will result in the launch of our patent pending Inspired
wristbands and Men’s and Women’s Sport ¼ Zip Pullovers. It will also provide
the launching pad to a greatly expanded product offering on website following
the crowdfunding event along with the scheduling of our first charity
fundraisers, perhaps in your city.FAQ’s
How
can I confirm my donation was actually made? You will be provided a tracking number with
your purchase that can be crosschecked with the donation payments made to the
charity.  We make donation payments on a
quarterly basis.
You
did not take my shirt size or wristband size?  Apparel sizing will be taken at the
conclusion of the event, as well as, wristband sizes. 
I
wasn’t able to provide my color choices for bands and/or shirt? Color
selections will be taken at the conclusion of the event.  However, we'll email you prior to the conclusion of this event to record your color choices. 
How
much is donated per item? For this event 10% of each items sales price will be donated to charity at our funding goal of $75,000 and above.  If we do not reach our funding goal we will still donate 3% of all revenues received through 4/1/14.  However, following this event, we will return to our standard 25% of sales price and 10% of sales price donated to charity on wristbands and all other apparel/gear, respectively. This does not include the cost to produce and send the
Inspired Child’s wristband.  This high of a donation percentage
off of the top line is basically unmatched in retail. Typical donations average
1%-5% at other retailers.  Further, the
majority of other retailers make donations to their causes and often off of the
bottom line. Compared to similar bands, Inspired wristbands donation is over 800% greater, translating into over 8x the positive change. 
Do
the bands have negative ions or magnets or holograms?  No. 
Research has concluded that this “technology” simply does not work any
better than a control group.  However,
the research has also concluded that the bracelets themselves actually create a
placebo effect that can positively influence the wearer’s mood or
performance.  That is the “science”
behind the Inspired Wristbands as well. 
The wearer is constantly reminded of the good they’ve done through
buying the wristband and further, the wearer is reminded constantly to be
inspired to enjoy and appreciate life or whatever inspiration the band
represents to each individual.
Can
I buy additional lower band colors (Sports Band)?
Yes.  Additional lower band colors are
available for purchase now and on the website following this event.  They can be bought individually or in packs
of 5. 
Can I buy
additional upper band colors (Sports Band)? No.  At the present time we are offering the light
and dark grey upper bands only.  Special
events in the future will likely make additional colors available on the
website.
What about the children’s
band:  Every item purchased triggers
the gift of an Inspired children’s band specifically designed for hospitalized
children to inspire and encourage them and their families.  The bands feature the lion, the feet and the
inspired logo that represent their strength, journey and triumph, respectively.
The inner part of the band features the word Inspired in Braille for vision
impaired children.  The bands are
distributed nationally to a hospitalized child in one of the 170 Children’s
Miracle Hospitals Network. 

What
are wristband sizes and dimensions? The wristbands are available in three sizes:
Small/Medium, Large and Extra-Large. Our Small/Medium size wristband is
approximately 7"" or 180 mm circumference and is generally a good fit for
kids, women, and smaller men. Our Large size wristband is approximately 8""
or 203 mm circumference and is our average adult size. Our Extra-Large size
wristband is approximately 9"" or 227 mm circumference. Streamlined Band’s measure
12 mm (0.47 in) width x 2 mm (0.07 in) thickness. Sports Band’s measure 18 mm (0.70 in) width x
4 mm (0.15 in) thickness. 
What
color and size is the sticker? The Inspired Sticker is
made of vinyl, is white in color and is approximately 4.25” x 1”.  Perfect size for cell phone covers, water
bottles, computers, etc. 
Do
warranties exist? 
Yes.  The LCD Stripe has a one
year warranty against manufacturer defect. 
The Inspired Wristbands have a 90 day warranty against manufacturer
defects.  
When
can I expect my items to be delivered?  We know you want to wear your Inspired gear
as soon as possible.  That’s why we’ve
already begun the process.  At this time
we expect delivery of the wristbands to be in May and the delivery of the apparel to be in August. Primarily due to time it takes to
manufacture the tools that ultimately produce our wristbands and LCD watches
given they are unique items.  All items
must make a transatlantic boat ride as well. 



Tell me again, how does it work? With every item purchased 2 events happen:First: A pre-determined monetary contribution is made to the charity of your choosing.  We all have different passions and your contributions should support the causes that inspire you. How does that work?We’ve defined 4 key non-profit categories: Environment; Health; Humanitarian; and Children. It’s simple really, on our website either express checkout and choose one of our preferred non-profits, or search for a particular non-profit within each category, perhaps a food pantry or boys and girls club in your community or search for leukemia or water pollution– you name it – if the charity is a legitimate 501(c)(3) organization, it can be added to our catalog.  The consumer will be given a tracking number to confirm the donation with the charity on a quarterly basis. Again, please note that for this event, all donations will benefit a children's hospital. Items bought on the website after this event will be available to choose other charities. Second: With every item purchased, a child in the hospital receives a specially designed Inspired wristband featuring the feet and the lion which represent their journey and strength, respectively.  Also, each child will receive a letter of encouragement on your behalf which you can choose to be personalized from you or keep it anonymous.",22.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><b><u>My Story</u></b></p>
<p>Having lost my job 6 months ago and having always been
interested in the business world, I decided to take the plunge and setup my
very first venture.  I have always been a
keen animal lover and have owned pets all my life.  I therefore decided to combine my passion for
pets and my entrepreneurial skills to create my business YORDOG, which
specialised in safety products for dogs. 
 I set about developing a range of
Dog safety products that were innovative, eco-friendly and of superior quality,
having been disappointed by the products currently in the market.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1073511/files/20141205070354-YORDOG_Green_LED_NEW.jpg?1417791834"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>(Image 1)</p><p>The pet market is a highly competitive industry but is
growing not only in the US but worldwide with the emergence of middle class in
developing nations.  This growth is
mainly due to the humanization of our pets; dogs are no longer seen as animals
but as our companions and members of the family.  This makes Dog safety and important issue too
many owners, especially when walking your dog at night.  Having your dog
visible to traffic and other members of public can help to keep it safe and <span>make your walk at dusk or night more
enjoyable and fun without the need to worry.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1078920/files/20141207185219-Indiegogo.jpg?1418007139"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(Image 2)<p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I

pets and my entrepreneurial skills to create my business YORDOG, which
specialised in safety products for dogs. 
 I set about developing a range of
Dog safety products that were innovative, eco-friendly and of superior quality,
having been disappointed by the products currently in the market.(Image 1)The pet market is a highly competitive industry but is
growing not only in the US but worldwide with the emergence of middle class in
developing nations.  This growth is
mainly due to the humanization of our pets; dogs are no longer seen as animals
but as our companions and members of the family.  This makes Dog safety and important issue too
many owners, especially when walking your dog at night.  Having your dog
visible to traffic and other members of public can help to keep it safe and make your walk at dusk or night more
enjoyable and fun without the need to worry.(Image 2)I
have now been trading for around 6 months and the feedback I have received from
my products has been excellent, with the majority of customers commenting on
the superior quality and super brightness of the LED’s and the difference it
makes to their dog walking experience.  I
currently only sell my products on marketplaces all of which charge relatively
high fees and in order to take YORDOG to its next stage I need to develop a web
presence.  I need your help to be part
of the next stage in YORDOG’s journey which is to set up an online website, so
my products can be sold to a global audience and hopefully make a difference too
many peoples dog walking experience at night.Business funding 
I can't wait to create a successful business
but also a morally just business. One that has, environmentally friendly
products, creates safe products, helps animals stay safe, and pays its share of
taxes! We want to create a company that its customers are proud of and stand
by. Here is what your donations will go towards:
Developing Company Website

Product Development 
Logistics
Marketing
In Conclusion
I am extremely proud to be able to offer these high quality
pet safe products to you and hope they can make a real difference to your pet’s
safety at night. 
I need your help to properly develop this new venture and to
reach a wider audience.  With a nudge
from all of you out there who support small business, are dog lovers, and want
to keep their pet’s safe I can expand quicker and build YORDOG as a brand. To reward you for your contributions and support for this
initiative I have an array of my products that are available to you as perks

<h3>What we need:</h3>
<p><b>SPACE</b>  Our first need is space.  We work out of a small basement in a 100 year old row home.  We have converted every inch into useful space and we are proud of our shop.  But it's time to move.  We currently have 3 lathes running about 6 hours a day and we are always bumping into each other.  We have no room to package our orders so we end up with stacks of boxes in our living room.  As we grow the need for more equipment will cramp our space even more making it unsafe.  So we need to rent an affordable studio</p>
<p><b>SUPPLIES</b> We would also like to have the funding to be able to buy our supplies in a large quantity.  We source from an American manufacturer and their price points for our razor supplies (each razor has a brass screw inside for example) breaks down as you order more.  The real savings comes at orders of 1000 or more.  Currently every cent we make goes back into our business and we haven't been able to save for the large order because we are always ordering 100 at a time to keep up with orders.  With help from you we can make that order and keep our prices reasonable.</p>
<p><b>MACHINERY</b> Lastly, running a wood shop that maintains the highest quality is expensive.  Machinery and tools being the biggest expense but other things like; power, dust control, and incidentals quickly add up.  Presently we function at a good level but with additions like a floor mount drill press ($700) we can cut about an hour labor each day! We need funding to order the equipment to keep us moving. </p>

<p>It took time to incorporate who we are and our philosophies
into the eyewear brand you see today. OJOS Eyewear is continually inspired by
like-minded travelers, entrepreneurs, artists, and innovators. We wanted OJOS to stand
for something bigger than ourselves. It represents a mentality and lifestyle
we’ve learned from traveling country to country and from the people we’ve met along
the way.  The OJOS mantra was born during
this experience: <b>“Go, Be, Do.”</b> GO explore the globe, BE the change you want to
see in the world, DO something extraordinary. Together, as the OJOS Eyewear
collective, we are advocates of action to live and preserve this mantra to the
best of our ability. </p>
<p><i>THE OJOS EYEWEAR MISSION STATEMENT:</i></p><p><i>""We are an
outpost for global citizenship in our mantra to ""go, be, do"". We
uphold unparalleled style and quality while implementing environmentalism to
limit the eco-impact of doing so. We exist to support this lifestyle and
eco-consciousness as we travel the globe and protect it collectively""</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p>

<p>The vehicle of our company is our product. We are an outpost
for global citizenship and we want our eyewear to last during the experiences of
our worldwide supporters living the “go, be, do” mantra (That is why we
guarantee our sunnies with a lifetime warranty). The entire OJOS collection is
designed independently and one of a kind by us.  In designing our products, we made sure of 2
things: a fashionable and timeless design with the highest quality, most
durable materials possible. </p>
<p>Our sunglasses feature handcrafted acetate frames, 100%
UVA/UVB protectant &amp; <b>POLARIZED</b>
CR-39 lenses, barrel 5 stainless steel spring hinges, stainless steel
flush-embedded OJOS logos, heat tempered wire core temples, and high quality
prints of 1% for the Planet membership, OJOS Environmentalism logo, and model
name. </p>
<p>Our design inspiration encompasses the same global approach found in contemporary, street, and surf fashion. We radiate the eclectic and
fashion-forward identity that makes us who we are – implementing timeless style
and trend true to our home of Venice, California.</p><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><a href=""http://issuu.com/ojos_eyewear/docs/ojos_lookbook_14___smaller_file_2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://issuu.com/ojos_eyewear/docs/ojos_eyewear_lookbook_2014"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Click Here for full 'OJOS EYEWEAR LOOKBOOK 2014' &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</a></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>

<p>We
illustrate our global philosophy together with our non-profit partners. We proudly plant 10 trees for every pair of eyewear sold, implement a self-imposed
1% “Earth tax” which we donate to our NPO partners (via 1% for the Planet membership), manufacture
our display cases locally in California utilizing reclaimed beetlekill pinewood, use packaging
with 5 eco certificates in recycling, green power, energy, and forestry, and
make the pouches for our eyewear through a micro-financed, grassroots campaign
with indigenous women of India to support their livelihood, way of life, and
traditional craft. </p>

<p>For every pair of eyewear sold, we plant <b>10 trees</b>. As one of
our carbon offset methods, we’ve partnered with Trees for the Future and The
Nature Conservancy to plant trees in countries around the world that suffer

</p><p>Using the best of what’s around is a cornerstone of our
company. All OJOS display cases utilize a reclaimed pinewood called Colorado
Beetlekill. A species of beetle carries a type of bacteria that is naturally
deforesting mass amounts of US National parks and forests – collectively this deforested
area is <b>1,760,000 acres</b>. We reclaimed this wood from Colorado that would
otherwise end up in landfills for all of our custom, hand-crafted display
cases.</p>

<p>All OJOS packaging and print materials come with <b>5 different

<p><b>Where is the money going?</b></p><p>All funds generated are going right towards our first production run to get OJOS off the ground and running. The funds generated from this campaign help us do just that... and we genuinely thank you for all of your support. </p>
<p><b>When will my OJOS sunnies be delivered?</b></p>
<p>Keep in mind, these are handcrafted. In creating the OJOS brand, we worked hard to make sure durability, quality, and style are second to none. This does mean that lead times take longer because of the attention to detail and quality. Our first production
run and lead time won’t allow us to ship them right away but you can expect to
get the OJOS sunnies of your choosing 8-12 weeks after your pledge is complete.
Don’t fret, of course they’ll arrive before summer.  We want you all looking good.</p>
<p><b>Is there a warranty for OJOS Eyewear?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely, we've got you covered. We at OJOS pride ourselves on design, quality,
and durability of our sunglasses and expect them to last during your ""Go,
Be, Do"" travels &amp; experiences. W<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ithin 1 year of purchase, we offer a no questions asked, “Halo” warranty, whereby we will replace your sunnies at no additional cost to you.  There is</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> also a lifetime guarantee against
manufacturer's defects on all sunglasses.  If something is to ever happen
via a manufacturing defect, send your sunnies in and we will replace them and
ship a pair back to you. All we ask is that you provide proof of purchase
along with sunnies for any warranty claim.</span></p>
<p><b>How large is the OJOS Eyewear collection?</b></p>
<p>We are launching
with 6 different models all of which are available in both gloss black and
tortoise shell – a total of 12 different options for you to choose from.  For now.</p>
<p><b>Are OJOS sunglasses polarized?</b></p>
<p>Of course, your eyes are important and we see no point in ever producing or purchasing sunglasses that are not polarized. Our entire OJOS line features 100% UVA/UVB protectant,
polarized CR-39 lenses.</p>
<p><b>Is OJOS Eyewear available in retail stores?</b></p>
<p>Not yet, but soon. We’re talking with some of the best
contemporary, street, and surf retailers on the map. We will be in retail
stores after this Indiegogo campaign. </p>
<p><b>Do you ship internationally?</b></p>
<p>Not in the US? No worries. We will just need you to add $15 for international shipping on your total when checking out OR you can choose to contribute $15 on a separate transaction.

into the eyewear brand you see today. OJOS Eyewear is continually inspired by
like-minded travelers, entrepreneurs, artists, and innovators. We wanted OJOS to stand
for something bigger than ourselves. It represents a mentality and lifestyle
we’ve learned from traveling country to country and from the people we’ve met along
the way.  The OJOS mantra was born during
this experience: “Go, Be, Do.” GO explore the globe, BE the change you want to
see in the world, DO something extraordinary. Together, as the OJOS Eyewear
collective, we are advocates of action to live and preserve this mantra to the
best of our ability. 
THE OJOS EYEWEAR MISSION STATEMENT:""We are an
outpost for global citizenship in our mantra to ""go, be, do"". We
uphold unparalleled style and quality while implementing environmentalism to
limit the eco-impact of doing so. We exist to support this lifestyle and
eco-consciousness as we travel the globe and protect it collectively""

The vehicle of our company is our product. We are an outpost
for global citizenship and we want our eyewear to last during the experiences of
our worldwide supporters living the “go, be, do” mantra (That is why we
guarantee our sunnies with a lifetime warranty). The entire OJOS collection is
designed independently and one of a kind by us.  In designing our products, we made sure of 2
things: a fashionable and timeless design with the highest quality, most
durable materials possible. 
Our sunglasses feature handcrafted acetate frames, 100%
UVA/UVB protectant & POLARIZED
CR-39 lenses, barrel 5 stainless steel spring hinges, stainless steel
flush-embedded OJOS logos, heat tempered wire core temples, and high quality
prints of 1% for the Planet membership, OJOS Environmentalism logo, and model
name. 
Our design inspiration encompasses the same global approach found in contemporary, street, and surf fashion. We radiate the eclectic and
fashion-forward identity that makes us who we are – implementing timeless style
and trend true to our home of Venice, California.>>>> Click Here for full 'OJOS EYEWEAR LOOKBOOK 2014' >>>>

Additionally, our pouches project was implemented and made possible through us setting up a micro-financed, grassroots campaign with indigenous women of India to support their way of life - providing jobs and income and preserving traditional craft. We're super proud of this project and and equally excited to provide such a timeless, quality product along with our sunnies. 
We
illustrate our global philosophy together with our non-profit partners. We proudly plant 10 trees for every pair of eyewear sold, implement a self-imposed
1% “Earth tax” which we donate to our NPO partners (via 1% for the Planet membership), manufacture
our display cases locally in California utilizing reclaimed beetlekill pinewood, use packaging
with 5 eco certificates in recycling, green power, energy, and forestry, and
make the pouches for our eyewear through a micro-financed, grassroots campaign
with indigenous women of India to support their livelihood, way of life, and
traditional craft. 

For every pair of eyewear sold, we plant 10 trees. As one of
our carbon offset methods, we’ve partnered with Trees for the Future and The
Nature Conservancy to plant trees in countries around the world that suffer
from deforestation and soil degradation. 

Using the best of what’s around is a cornerstone of our
company. All OJOS display cases utilize a reclaimed pinewood called Colorado
Beetlekill. A species of beetle carries a type of bacteria that is naturally
deforesting mass amounts of US National parks and forests – collectively this deforested
area is 1,760,000 acres. We reclaimed this wood from Colorado that would
otherwise end up in landfills for all of our custom, hand-crafted display
cases.

All OJOS packaging and print materials come with 5 different
eco-certifications to represent our eco-driven philosophy and foundation. These
certifications include the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Sustainable Forest
Initiative (SFI), EPA Green Power Partner, 100% recycled paper, and non-toxic,
vegetable based inks and dyes.

We took the initiative to make a social impact with the OJOS
multifunctional pouches that our eyewear comes in.  All OJOS pouches are made via a micro-financed,
grassroots campaign with indigenous women of India to support livelihood, way
of life, and traditional craft. This trade fair certified project allows us to
support an amazing cause and provide our supporters with an extremely unique
item (see more above in the ""OUR CUSTOM POUCHES"" section).

We are a proud member of 1% for the Planet and voluntarily
tax ourselves a 1% “Earth Tax” to donate to worldwide organizations that work
to protect, preserve, and sustain healthy environments. We work to cover our
environmental footprint for our generation, and generations to come. In 2014,
our 1% goes directly to the Surfrider Foundation to protect the world’s oceans,
beaches, reefs, and aquatic ecosystems.
We want to thank you and the Indiegogo community for the
support! We are looking forward to our full-scale launch with this campaign but
we simply cannot make that happen without your help. All funds generated from
this campaign are going towards our production run so we can fully and
successfully launch OJOS. Feel free to take off your coat and stay awhile, let
us know if you have any questions. Cheers from us at OJOS!                                                        ***  FAQ  ***                                           (as answered by Tyler & Phil)
I have a question or I want to drop you a line, how do I
contact you?
Drop us a line anytime: info@ojoseyewear.com
Where is the money going?All funds generated are going right towards our first production run to get OJOS off the ground and running. The funds generated from this campaign help us do just that... and we genuinely thank you for all of your support. 
When will my OJOS sunnies be delivered?
Keep in mind, these are handcrafted. In creating the OJOS brand, we worked hard to make sure durability, quality, and style are second to none. This does mean that lead times take longer because of the attention to detail and quality. Our first production
run and lead time won’t allow us to ship them right away but you can expect to
get the OJOS sunnies of your choosing 8-12 weeks after your pledge is complete.
Don’t fret, of course they’ll arrive before summer.  We want you all looking good.
Is there a warranty for OJOS Eyewear?
Absolutely, we've got you covered. We at OJOS pride ourselves on design, quality,
and durability of our sunglasses and expect them to last during your ""Go,
Be, Do"" travels & experiences. Within 1 year of purchase, we offer a no questions asked, “Halo” warranty, whereby we will replace your sunnies at no additional cost to you.  There is also a lifetime guarantee against
manufacturer's defects on all sunglasses.  If something is to ever happen
via a manufacturing defect, send your sunnies in and we will replace them and
ship a pair back to you. All we ask is that you provide proof of purchase
along with sunnies for any warranty claim.
How large is the OJOS Eyewear collection?
We are launching
with 6 different models all of which are available in both gloss black and
tortoise shell – a total of 12 different options for you to choose from.  For now.
Are OJOS sunglasses polarized?
Of course, your eyes are important and we see no point in ever producing or purchasing sunglasses that are not polarized. Our entire OJOS line features 100% UVA/UVB protectant,
polarized CR-39 lenses.
Is OJOS Eyewear available in retail stores?
Not yet, but soon. We’re talking with some of the best
contemporary, street, and surf retailers on the map. We will be in retail
stores after this Indiegogo campaign. 
Do you ship internationally?
Not in the US? No worries. We will just need you to add $15 for international shipping on your total when checking out OR you can choose to contribute $15 on a separate transaction.

<p><i>Disclaimer: While Sheerly Genius has been developed using ballistic grade fibers, the end product is not in itself bulletproof. These are for the boardroom, not the battlefield!</i><br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our proprietary yarn</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">is the strongest yarn in the world.</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Our sheers<b> </b>took over a year of R&amp;D, which included the development of our yarn.  Sheerly Genius yarn combines <b>ballistic grade fibers (up to to 10 times stronger than steel), with a proprietary knit and manufacturing process</b> to create the world's first pair of indestructible sheers.<b> </b>Think your favourite sheer tights but the strength, durability, and comfort of leggings. Our fibers are so strong they actually break traditional pantyhose machines so we've retrofit machines specifically to work for our product. Our sheers are not only reusable - but tested up to 50 wears!</p>
<p>After a successful Kickstarter campaign, production of our proprietary yarn is already underway, but hitting our goal here on Indiegogo will allow us to buy the machine we need to make *every* pair of sheers we ship to all our backers this fall sheer from waistband to toe (our most requested feature!). We'll also be able to add high end finishes like flat seams and an invisible control top.<br/><br/><i>See this behind the scenes footage of our founder, Katherine Homuth, hanging from Sheerly Genius vs. a regular pair of sheers while filming our crowdfunding video! Spoiler alert: the regular sheers do not hold up.</i></p></figure></div><div data-href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6p4JwDs_bo""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""344"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6p4JwDs_bo?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" width=""612""></iframe></div></div><div data-href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6p4JwDs_bo"">

Unsatisfied with all of the options available in traditional apparel, we set out to produce the world's first pair of sheers made using the same type of fiber used in bulletproof vests. Aka: some of the strongest fibers in the world.</p><h3>Ridiculously Comfortable </h3><p>Our sheers have been designed using a complex system of knitting techniques, ensuring a run-resistant pantyhose look, always. So your clear nail polish can stay in the clear. Our fibers are not only some of the strongest and most durable in the world, but they are also non-toxic, naturally anti-bacterial, and soft to the touch - making them ridiculously comfortable. These sheers are expertly crafted, with reinforced seams and an invisible waistband. They are designed to look great on any body type. </p><h3>Patent Pending </h3><p>Sheerly Genius sheers are patent pending and our manufacturing process is a trade secret.

<br/><i style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>It turns out, creating the world's first pair of indestructible sheers is no easy feat! </i><br/> </h3></figure></div><h3>1.  Ignorance is bliss</h3><div data-id=""20237754""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p>When we started our first thought was, what are the strongest fibers we know? Let's just make a pair of pantyhose out of that. But let's just say we were being a bit naive. And that's probably a good thing because I don't think we would have started if we knew just how hard it was going to be at the start!</p>
<h3>2.  We don't know what we don't know</h3>
<p>The thickness of a fibre is measured in denier. Pantyhose starts at 100 denier or less. Sheer pantyhose are 30 denier or less. We quickly found our that most low denier fibers are also low tenacity (meaning they aren't very strong). We needed a miracle fiber that would be both super low denier and super high tenacity.</p>
<h3>3.  Let's start a process of elimination.</h3>
<p>When you think strong fibres, most people's first thought is kevlar. But the lowest denier kevlar comes in 1000 denier. So it was a non-starter. All of the other lower denier fibers we found on the market would break when we'd pull them off the spool with little or no effort.</p>
<h3>4.  We found the miracle fiber.</h3>
<p>Eventually we were able to get our hands on the strongest fiber in the world. 10 times stronger than steel, and used in ballistic applications like bulletproof vests. We knew 100 denier wouldn't be fine enough for a final product, but at least it was within range of other pantyhose and it gave us a place to start. After initial testing we were amazed by the strength of this fiber. Literally none of us could break it. We knew if we could get it in a lower denier we could produce some pretty badass pantyhose with it.</p>
<h3>5.  This is not going to work.</h3>
<p>But there were a few problems, not only was it not fine enough, the fiber was not dyeable, meaning we'd only ever be able to make white pantyhose, and it had no stretch.</p>
<h3>6.  I guess we just need to build our own fiber.</h3>
<p>To solve the denier and color issues we went directly to the fiber manufacturers and after a year of R&amp;D developed the first fiber of its kind that was colored, and under 30 denier.</p>
<h3>7.  It's so strong it's breaking the machines.</h3>
<p>Now that we had the fiber we needed, we hit another roadblock. It turns out that the strongest fibers in the world are actually so strong they break hosiery machines. After lots of trial and error we ended up hosiery machines down and rebuild the from the ground up to work for our <br/>application.</p>
<h3>8.  Now we need our own machines.</h3>
<p>Even once we had the fiber, and the hosiery machines working we still had to figure out how to make the fiber stretch without compromising the strength of the end product. To do this we developed a proprietary yarn that results in a product that is not just ridiculously strong, but also stretchy.</p>
<h3>9.  Holy s*** we did it.</h3>
<p>After over a year of R&amp;D, we did it! We had created a pair of pantyhose that doesn’t rip, snag or tear, and we were ready to take it to the world. Help us get the product in the hands of women around the world by backing the project here today. </p></figure></div><p>Your support will give us the funding we need to produce the first production size batch of our proprietary fiber, and will allow us to retrofit more machines to work with our insanely strong fibers!  <br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sheertex-indestructible-sheer-tights-design"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523127707/wgay6yjzwed5uencjggo.svg"" src=""""/></a></p><p> </p><div data-id=""20348101""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523140530/lrd9bawkjtfkpoezvnei.svg"" src=""""/></h3>

Sheerly Genius has developed the world's first pair of indestructible sheers using our proprietary yarn which has been developed from the same fiber used in bulletproof vests.The sexiness and breathability of a pair of sheers, and the strength and comfort of your favorite leggings!


 


Disclaimer: While Sheerly Genius has been developed using ballistic grade fibers, the end product is not in itself bulletproof. These are for the boardroom, not the battlefield! 
 
Our proprietary yarn
is the strongest yarn in the world.
 
Our sheers took over a year of R&D, which included the development of our yarn.  Sheerly Genius yarn combines ballistic grade fibers (up to to 10 times stronger than steel), with a proprietary knit and manufacturing process to create the world's first pair of indestructible sheers. Think your favourite sheer tights but the strength, durability, and comfort of leggings. Our fibers are so strong they actually break traditional pantyhose machines so we've retrofit machines specifically to work for our product. Our sheers are not only reusable - but tested up to 50 wears!
After a successful Kickstarter campaign, production of our proprietary yarn is already underway, but hitting our goal here on Indiegogo will allow us to buy the machine we need to make *every* pair of sheers we ship to all our backers this fall sheer from waistband to toe (our most requested feature!). We'll also be able to add high end finishes like flat seams and an invisible control top.See this behind the scenes footage of our founder, Katherine Homuth, hanging from Sheerly Genius vs. a regular pair of sheers while filming our crowdfunding video! Spoiler alert: the regular sheers do not hold up.
 Thanks to our successful Kickstarter campaign we've already kicked off production of our proprietary fiber, but hitting this goal will allow us to buy the machine we need to make *every* pair we ship to our backers this fall sheer from waistband to toe (our most requested feature!). We'll also be able to add high end finishes like flat seams and an invisible control top. To hit this goal we're offering the Indiegogo community our classic style AND exclusives like our NEW footless sheers and a moisture wicking headband.

We know you need a product that can take you from morning through night, without sacrificing on comfort or style, so our sheers are not just strong but as light weight as your tights, but as comfortable as a pair of leggings. Our sheers are made with the strongest pantyhose in the world. They are patent pending and tested up to 50 wears. They are made with proprietary ballistic fibers, up to 10x stronger than steel but look and feel like regular sheers.  Proprietary Fiber We searched high and low to find a sheer fiber strong enough to produce a truly lifeproof pair of sheers. Unsatisfied with all of the options available in traditional apparel, we set out to produce the world's first pair of sheers made using the same type of fiber used in bulletproof vests. Aka: some of the strongest fibers in the world.Ridiculously Comfortable Our sheers have been designed using a complex system of knitting techniques, ensuring a run-resistant pantyhose look, always. So your clear nail polish can stay in the clear. Our fibers are not only some of the strongest and most durable in the world, but they are also non-toxic, naturally anti-bacterial, and soft to the touch - making them ridiculously comfortable. These sheers are expertly crafted, with reinforced seams and an invisible waistband. They are designed to look great on any body type. Patent Pending Sheerly Genius sheers are patent pending and our manufacturing process is a trade secret. So if you’re thinking you’ll find something like Sheerly Genius at your local pharmacy, think again. #sorrynotsorry   
 

Because smart woman do their homework.From wash and wear to wood snags,we've put our product to the test.Literally.  THE VELCRO TESTVelcro is no match for the sheer strength of Sheerly Genius. THE ZIPPER TESTZip 'em up, these sheers will hold up to anything. THE RING TESTYour 24-karat diamonds won’t be a problem for Sheerly Genius. THE PULL TESTPull as hard as you can. You won’t rip these babies. 
  1 Billion (1,000,000,000)disposable pairs of sheersend up in the landfill every year.  By backing Sheerly Genius you're saying no to the almost 1,000,000,000 pairs of sheers that end up in the landfill (or dead in your drawer) each year. You wouldn't throw out your underwear after one wear - so why should you have to throw out your sheers?The Sheerly Genius Recycling ProgramWhen you receive your Sheerly Genius sheers you will also have the opportunity to send us all of the old, broken and destroyed pairs of sheers you have sitting in your drawers (what we like to call your pantyhose graveyard!). We work with recycling partners to take your old sheers and transform their raw materials into new products. Let no pair go to waste!Reusable Wash BagNot even our packaging is disposable. Every pair of Sheerly Genius come with their own mesh back laundry bag. It’s even cute enough to use as a clutch! Use the bag to store your tights and then throw them in the washing machine. No bleach, fabric softeners, no ironing. Just wash in cold water and hang to dry.Back us now, and you will have the opportunity to select your size when we fulfill.If you don’t see your size here, we still want to make Sheerly Genius for you! Please back this project so we can grow as a company and make it possible to create the sizes you need. Please also write to us in the comments with your size preference!   The competition really are are no match for Sheerly Genius. Watch our videos to see how Sheerly Genius holds up against the rest. Watch us compare Sheerly Genius to brands like Wolford, Commando and Spanx. You'll have your finger through a pair of the other guys in seconds - while Sheerly Genius will hold up to whatever life throws at it!  Not even a metal zipper can tear through Sheerly Genius! Say goodbye to silk, gloves, extra pairs and clear nail polish! Sheerly Genius is proprietary from toe to waist. There is nothing else like Sheerly Genius on the market. Trust us, we've literally tried everything. Our proprietary fiber is naturally cooling. Go science!   We've tested Sheerly Genius up to 50 wears. It would take 25 pairs (!!) of sheers to get the same number of wears out of the average brand of sheers.  Some things just make sense.(and we're not just talking fashion sense)In 50 wears you'll have saved 25 pairs of sheers from the landfill.

Nylon is an incredibly durable fiber used in many products from rock climbing harnesses to parachutes. Supplex® takes the durability of nylon to the next level. The uncommonly strong fibers are air-texturized to make them incredibly soft. Supplex® takes hundreds of these extremely fine, air-texturized nylon fibers and spins them into thick durable yarns. The added fibers cause the yarns themselves to be stronger, but also more dynamic. The resulting fabric is abrasion resistant, ultra-durable, with the soft hand feel of cotton, and the perfect drape and stretch.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""20727955""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1523645718/p167ge3nezfgzg7cdcyl.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""20691509""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/8ae2b045"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1523645719/pehzdliiaf4wfahirm2e.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/766542489/the-evolution-pant-one-pant-unlimited-potential/pledge/new?clicked_reward=false&amp;refresh=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">                                               </a>                                                  </p><div data-id=""20668609""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1523645720/lut4qvoq8u2b3innp0nb.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""20670193""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p> </p>

<p>We have been in the clothing business since 2014 and have brought over 24 styles to market. Our team has extensive experience in fabric design and manufacturing high-quality apparel as well as fulfilling lots of orders. We have our manufacturers lined up, and our production team is waiting for our signal. We know what we're doing, and you should be confident that we will deliver what we promise when we say we will. <br/><br/>We have dealt with our fair share of manufacturing hiccups and always deal with them in a transparent, responsible way to keep our customers not just happy with their products, but also proud to support us. Should any issues come up, you can be confident we will handle them with transparency and the utmost care for you, our backers. <br/><br/>Supply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make when we say we'll make it. But sometimes things happen, like fabric delays due to yarn being stuck in customs. We add time padding for these events, but sometimes it's not enough. If anything should arrive late we will get through it together. <br/><br/>We're deeply committed to and excited about delivering a high-quality product, on time, that we know you'll enjoy for a long time to come. <br/><br/>Thank you for your support!

 WHAT MAKES THE EVOLUTION PANT SO REVOLUTIONARY?  
 ARE THESE OUTDOOR PANTS?  Let's make one thing clear - these aren't just travel or outdoor pants! The Evolution Pant has been meticulously designed and crafted from the yarn level up to perform, look great, and feel great in every scenario no matter the weather or occasion.  COLORS:Thanks to your overwhelming support we’ve quickly reached our stretch goals, and will now be able to offer The Evolution Pant in THREE classic colors: Charcoal, Khaki, and Navy.    
    
 
 To create the most versatile pants ever, we had to start from the yarn. We searched for years to find the ideal fabric with the soft feel and look of a cotton fabric, the durability and toughness of a nylon, stretch, and stain resistance. We finally found the ideal partner to create this fabric at a fully vertically integrated, sustainable, Bluesign approved mill in Sweden.  The key to the Evolution Pant is the nylon Supplex® fabric. Nylon is an incredibly durable fiber used in many products from rock climbing harnesses to parachutes. Supplex® takes the durability of nylon to the next level. The uncommonly strong fibers are air-texturized to make them incredibly soft. Supplex® takes hundreds of these extremely fine, air-texturized nylon fibers and spins them into thick durable yarns. The added fibers cause the yarns themselves to be stronger, but also more dynamic. The resulting fabric is abrasion resistant, ultra-durable, with the soft hand feel of cotton, and the perfect drape and stretch.

  THE EVOLUTION PANT LONG   Model: 5'10' 160 lbs, size 32   CARE:
  Due to our pieces having a Durable Water Repellent application, they will absorb less odor and staining. Thus, they can and should be washed less frequently.CARE: Wash with like colors with mild detergent cold. Tumble dry low or lay flat. Do not use fabric softener during wash as this may damage the water repellency. Do NOT bleach. Do NOT dry clean. 
 
A BETTER PROCESS:   Why Bluesign? The Bluesign® system regulates and reduces environmental impact through the entire textile supply chain from yarn to the finished product. The system reviews the use of chemistry, energy usage, water and air emissions, worker safety and consumer safety. By developing guidelines and monitoring the implementation of the bluesign® system, Bluesign Technologies is encouraging the textile industry to increase their efforts in sustainability and reduce their environmental impact across the entire textile supply chain. Handmade in the USA

 Western Rise was founded on a desire to make multi-functional clothing that looks amazing and performs even better. We were overwhelmed by the amount of stuff in the world and wanted to simplify our lives and focus on the things that actually matter. Stylish, versatile, performance clothing allows you to do more with less meaning you can ditch the big suitcase, travel light, do more and see more.It took a lot of people to bring this project to you, and we couldn’t be more excited!  We truly believe that it is not only our responsibility, it’s our obligation to protect the world we are part of and enjoy. Because of this we are 1% For The Planet Members and donate 1% of our revenue (gross revenue, not profit) to a group of certified nonprofits. Please note that per Kickstarter guidelines, we cannot use this crowdfunding project to raise funds for charity. We will certainly support our beneficiary organizations outside of Kickstarter, and celebrate this commitment with our backer community. 
 We can't say it enough. Thank you for supporting believing in us. We can't wait to get these new pants in your hands.    
Risks and Challenges:
We have been in the clothing business since 2014 and have brought over 24 styles to market. Our team has extensive experience in fabric design and manufacturing high-quality apparel as well as fulfilling lots of orders. We have our manufacturers lined up, and our production team is waiting for our signal. We know what we're doing, and you should be confident that we will deliver what we promise when we say we will. We have dealt with our fair share of manufacturing hiccups and always deal with them in a transparent, responsible way to keep our customers not just happy with their products, but also proud to support us. Should any issues come up, you can be confident we will handle them with transparency and the utmost care for you, our backers. Supply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make when we say we'll make it. But sometimes things happen, like fabric delays due to yarn being stuck in customs. We add time padding for these events, but sometimes it's not enough. If anything should arrive late we will get through it together. We're deeply committed to and excited about delivering a high-quality product, on time, that we know you'll enjoy for a long time to come. Thank you for your support! We are deeply grateful that you're on this journey with us!",57.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Full Grain Leather refers to hides that have not been sanded, buffed, or snuffed (as opposed to corrected grain) to remove imperfections (or natural marks) on the surface of the hide. The grain remains to allow the fiber strength and durability. The grain also has breathability, resulting in less moisture from prolonged contact.

Aniline ages gracefully showing natural wrinkles and creases. Quite simply, aniline exhibits the perfect imperfections of real leather.</p><p> </p><h3>

 __________
 We created Folklore when we were introduced to the fact that Pakistan is the land known for its elite 1800-year-old leather craftsmanship and supplies leather to top luxury brands around the world. This led to the thought that when we have such rich resources available in our home country and we have got the capability and capacity to make luxury affordable globally, so why aren't we doing it yet.The fact that further motivated us to launch Folklore is that leading brands usually take advantage of the local craftsman by giving them the minute amount of what that earn.We wanted to change this by empowering craftsman because we believe that they are the backbone of our industry who responsibly module the end product assuring that it is of high quality. In brief, Folklore is a tribute to craftsman, blended perfectly with contemporary interpretations in design and material.  What remains unique is the handmade art of craftsmen of Pakistan, thus it should be protected and valued. We believe the quality of the leather is confined to its craftsman. Craftsman breathes life into the leather and final product. Team folklore believes are policy to empower craftsmen will improve their living standards and simultaneously will result in the high-quality end product, The best leather products.__________ INTRODUCINGOUR NEW RANGE__________ TEXTURED LEATHER CLUTCH BAGINDIEGOGO $199 | RETAIL $299A stylish solution to carry and organize your daily essentials.

 We believe that the quality of the final product is as good as the quality of the raw material it is made of. Therefore, we are working with the best tanneries and only the best leather makes the cut for our designs. We want to deliver you the best!! OUR LEATHERFull Grain Leather is the best quality leather available. Full Grain Leather refers to hides that have not been sanded, buffed, or snuffed (as opposed to corrected grain) to remove imperfections (or natural marks) on the surface of the hide. The grain remains to allow the fiber strength and durability. The grain also has breathability, resulting in less moisture from prolonged contact. Rather than wearing out, it will develop a patina over time. Full grain leather is often seen as the most authentic type of leather because it maintains all of the texture from the original cowhide. Advantages of Full Grain Leather is a smooth and luxurious surface.Aniline leather is the finest quality leather, aniline is the most beautiful, tender and magnificently supple of all leather types. Aniline leather is the most coveted of all leather types as only the very best rawhides can qualify for this type. Aniline indicates that the leather has been dyed the whole way through. Aniline ages gracefully showing natural wrinkles and creases. Quite simply, aniline exhibits the perfect imperfections of real leather.

Nearly half of all those -73 million- are in hazardous work that directly endangers their health, safety, and moral development. More than <strong>40% of the child labour is found in the Asia</strong> and the Pacific (62.1 million).

A Change in our People and our Planet. From the inside out and from the roots up, a new set of social values starting with our shoes, all the way through to our Social and Planting project.  Our Main Values Wado SneakersThe first collection is inspired by the 80s fashion: a retro shape and colors that are aligned with our perception of nature, using the off white color as the basis. As a token of our reforestation activity we have added a detail of cork on the tongue, which will somehow appear in all our products. Wado Modelo 89 is available in 6 colors: blue, beige, black, garnet, green and white.----------More details on our website.  ---------- Forests cover 31% of the land area on our planet. They produce vital oxygen and provide homes for people and wildlife. Unfortunately, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), we humans are destroying 7,4 million hectares of forests annually which is the size of Benelux (Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg altogether).In Wado we fight against deforestation since 2018 allowing anyone to take part in our project. Every time you buy a pair of shoes we plant two trees in collaboration with the NGO We Forest.Joining forces enables us not only to plant the trees, but also to train the local communities on how to regenerate and protect the forest so it can become a sustainable wood and food resource to them. In one year our team has achieved more than we had never expected.So far we’ve planted 45.628 trees, 14.000 trees in India, 31.380 in Zambia and 248 in the Amazon and our goal is to double this number for next year.See our tree planting certificate.  ---------- We produce in the EU and we are proud of it.Currently, 87% of the world of footwear is manufactured in Asia or in developing countries, which is often linked to labor exploitation through the hiring of cheap workforce and where unfortunately many times workers’ rights are nonexistent or extremely limited. Often, workers are squeezed as if they were machines; they have interminable work shifts, have precarious salaries and scarce security in their factories. MISERABLE WAGESIn Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, China, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia or Cambodia among others, the paid minimum wage barely represents between half to fifth of the living wage. For instance, in Bangladesh, the minimum wage has recently increased to 63$/month, but despite this rise, it is still 60% below of 170$, the needed living wage. ENDLESS WORKING HOURSLong working hours and forced overtime are a major concern among garment workers.  Factory managers typically push employees to work between 10 and 12 hours, sometimes 16 to 18 hours a day. A seven-day working week is becoming the norm during the peak season, particularly in China, despite limits placed by the law. UNACCEPTABLE HEALTH & SAFETY CONDITIONSThe collapse of the Rana Plaza in 2013, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, killing 1134 workers and injuring more than 2.500 who manufactured garment for many of the biggest apparel companies in the world, has revealed the unacceptable working conditions of the whole fashion industry to the world. Employees usually work with no ventilation, breathing in toxic substances, inhaling fiber dust or blasted sand in unsafe buildings. Accidents, fires, injuries, and disease are very frequent occurrences on textile production sites.FREQUENT USE OF CHILD LABOURAccording to the International Labour Organisation, 152 million children are engaged in child labour worldwide. Nearly half of all those -73 million- are in hazardous work that directly endangers their health, safety, and moral development. More than 40% of the child labour is found in the Asia and the Pacific (62.1 million). Because the fashion industry requires low-skilled labour, child labour is particularly common in this industry.For more detailed info and sources check our transparency section.  We believe in a better fashion industry.We were determined not to be part of this. From the beginning we only wanted to partner with suppliers that respect their workers, improving their life conditions and providing them a good working environment; a factory where employment is freely chosen and where child labor is not used in any case. Therefore, we focused on finding partners in the EU that work under the same values as we believe in.Our search started in our own country, Spain, but after visiting several factories and not meeting our expectations, we decided to knock the door on our neighbor country, Portugal, well known not only for its quality footwear industry but also for the excellence of its service and the ability to deliver small series; We had finally found our partner.  GREAT QUALITY, GREAT PEOPLE.Located in the North of Portugal, Felgueiras is the heart of the country’s footwear industry. Our partner, You Shoes, maintains a high standard of ethics: fair wages and shifts, gender equality and most importantly, they treat their workers as family.The employees of the factory receive an average salary of 850€/month distributed in 14 pays and its gender distribution is balanced (60% men – 40% women). They work 8 hours a day from Monday to Friday and overtime hours are paid 50% more. On peak season, extra hours are permitted but also regulated; Concerning holidays, they have 22 working days of paid vacations a year. Each employee contributes with 11% of their salary to the INSS (government retirement plan).  In Wado we encourage these suppliers to increase transparency by requiring our collaborators to perform social audits and recurrent chemical tests to verify that trust, integrity and honesty are guaranteed in their work environments. We yearly conduct a social and ethical trade audit to make sure our factories respect our values ​​and meet our criteria as well as to identify areas where improvement can still be made.We also work with suppliers from Alicante, Spain. The concentration of our manufacturing suppliers within the same geographical area allows us to create an efficient and fast collaborating network which ensures the use of local materials and reduces our carbon footprint.   The Wado Team  This project has been our life for over a year, and honestly it hasn't been easy. An industry fashion-related projects requires a great effort to come up with a product with an exceptional design and different values compared to other brands. However, we have achieved a great result and we are really grateful to all the people who made in possible for us to get here. Want to join the revolution?We believe that by producing conscientiously and by planting two trees for each sale we will be able to encourage potential Gamechangers to carry out many other eco-friendly actions. We belive that each and every one of us is a potential Gamechanger and all actions, whether they are big or small, will contribute to a more sustainable world.

</div></div>","DRYMILE shoes are made for a new generation of adventurers. The Xtreme Knit technology and the EZbend sole are perfectly suited for the outdoors by giving your feet protection against rain, snow, warm and cold - breathable comfort in any weather, or any terrain. 
 

 

 
Whether you are hiking, camping, skiing or snowboarding, DRYMILE is a comfortable and practical choice to keep you in motion. A great option to switch your shoes for a rainy day, or for a comfortable walk in the snow so you can take a break on the slope. You can even wear them at the beach, thanks to DRYMILE’s waterproof and sandproof design. 

 

 
Our Xtreme Knit technology with the most flexible, enduring, 100% waterproof and 100% breathable stretch knit material consists of 3 layers:
 

DRYMILE’s unique rubber sole makes the shoe ideal for cold weather. 
 

 
Our patent-pending sole technology (EZ-Bend) makes it easier for the shoe to be folded. This is possible because of a special material and design in the middle of the sole. This feature also makes the shoe packable. 
 

 


The patented multi-function, quick-release buckle makes securing the DRYMILE shoe fast and easy. Just release it when taking off the shoe. You can also clip it to your belt or backpack. 
 


 

 
The insole is custom designed to fit perfectly inside Drymile shoes.
 

 
With the insole in, the shoe’s heel is 3mm higher than the toe area - which is designed to give your heel a bit more cushion.
 
       
 
 


 

 


 



 



 


 


DRYMILE shoes come in 4 colors that were inspired by our love for the outdoors.

 

To order the right size for yourself, you can measure your foot from the back of the heel to the tip of the toe. Then, look up which size would fit you best in the table below. If your foot size is between two numbers, go with the higher size because it’s usually better for your feet to have extra room.

Making advancements in both we offer the best solution on both ends of the lens, with style and clarity. Capturing a clear view of your life's adventures, creating memories that last. We bring you sunglasses to both look and see the best in.The problems we are solving...
The unimaginative and stagnant designs plaguing brands traditionally known for the high quality of their materials and optical performance
An overemphasis on fashion at the expense of poor lens quality and cheap poly materials mainly on the part of major designer brands
A lack of commitment to eye health and sight (primarily in the developing world)
  With a classical emphasis on quality and an innovative take on design, we have sourced the purest optical lens clarity and paired them with new generation polarised filter. Designed to reduce sun glare for day-long comfort and lifelong eye health, once you’ve seen the world through our high resolution lenses, you’ll never look back in less. Using classic proportions and symmetry to naturally suit on a wide variety of face shapes, our bespoke designs created in London are unique. Life is a series of sights. We want you to both look and see the best in it.   The power is in the glassesMore than an accessory, sunglasses should enhance our experience of what life has to offer; enhancing the normal light-filtering capabilities of your eyes and protecting against the sun's damaging ultraviolet rays. No one is immune to sunlight-related eye problems. It's up to you to keep your eyes healthy.   Lens Quality Golden Hours Polarised CR-39  lenses:
Daylong visual comfort - Because your eyes aren’t constantly challenged by glare.
Enhances clarity of vision- Gives greater contrast so you can even see past reflections into water!
Reduces eyestrain - frequent adjustments to the glare from reflections is taxing on the eyes and can lead to fatigue
Conveys colours faithfully to enrich your world.

Different surface finishing processes have been chosen for the two case options to make the very best of each colour. The stainless steel version has been brushed in alternate directions on the bezel and case to create a more elemental look, while the black PVD version has been given a fine bead blast finish to produce a very flat matt finish overall.The movementWe chose the Seiko NH35A, as it has consistently proven itself to be an immensely durable and reliable movement. This brilliant piece of Japanese engineering boasts great accuracy and has a 41-hour power reserve, so will keep itself wound if worn every day. It also has a hacking second hand, which means that when the crown is pulled out the second hand stops, making it very easy to set the time accurately. The fact that it is made by one of the most respected watch manufacturers in the world not only represents a universal seal of quality but also means it can easily be serviced anywhere around the globe.So that you can appreciate the simple magic of the automatic movement every day, the Model One has a sapphire crystal display case back. To add a touch of individuality the alkin logo has been laser-engraved on to the rotor.The strapsOur German-made vegetable-tanned leather straps use organic tanning techniques instead of the immensely polluting chromium tanning process most commonly used in commercial leather production. Despite being made for thick 3.5mm hide, the straps are very supple and soft, and will only improve with age. They are made by people who have been crafting straps for generations — the quality and finish are second to none. The straps will come in a choice of three colours: black, brown and cognac. The buckle will be finished to match the case and laser-engraved with the alkin logo.The double watch pouchEach Model One will ship in a vegetable-tanned leather travel pouch that can be used throughout the watch’s lifetime. The leather we have chosen for the pouch has a raw colour and finish and is much stiffer than the straps. With time and use the leather will slowly soften and the finish will darken and age beautifully.Funding processWe reached our funding goal for our first crowdsourcing campaign back in April of this year, so all orders have now been placed with our manufacturing partners.By pledging for this project you are placing a pre-order for a watch, which means you will have to wait for the watch to be made. In return you will have a high quality automatic watch at a discounted price.Giving 1% backWe recognise the impact of just creating more stuff, so have put the sustainability of the alkin brand central to the business mission. Fundamentally, designing a product that is rooted in longevity is key to keeping the product in use for as long as possible. The quality of the components and a reliable, widely used movement that can be very easily serviced or repaired are essential factors. In addition to this, if we are successful with our funding, we will pledge to annually donate 1% of gross profit to environmental causes around the world.Thank youA huge thank you to everyone who has given their support on this journey and taken the time to follow this campaign. It has occasionally been very challenging, but has always remained a real labour of love. To achieve funding and see the alkin brand grow would be a long-held dream come true. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to get in touch, either through Kickstarter or directly at info@alkinwatches.com.All the best, Charlie Fowler",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Silk Squirrel Gone Nuts</b></p>
<p>Painting and designing are my life. As a silk painter, I
feel blessed that people love my hand-painted, one-of-a-kind designs inspired from
nature. As one buyer recently said, “From flower close-ups to dramatic
landscapes, Tina’s exquisite art lifts my spirit every time I see it. I love
the vibrant, shimmering quality of her silk art, and it’s also irresistibly
touchable.” </p>
<p>But recently, I have found that demand is outstripping my
ability to create new pieces, making it hard to keep them on the shelves. And
since my creations each take long hours to paint, many people who really
appreciate them can’t afford to buy them. </p>
<p>Thinking about this problem, I have been dreaming, researching
and planning how I can bring my art to more people in a more affordable way. I
have experimented with reproducing my art as wearable silk, and have gotten strong
preliminary orders and sales from my test market boutiques. As a result, I am excited to pursue the path of
creating “art to wear.” </p>
<p>These pieces will take the form of gorgeous silk scarves,
shawls, and ponchos, all printed with my colorful paintings. I have tested the
quality of the silk reproductions done by a respected textile printing company,
and found the results meet my high standards. The resulting pieces have great
depth of color and the silk used has a wonderfully fine, floating quality. </p>

Journey
<p>I've always been creative and excelled in art. In
college, I started studying art therapy, but soon realized that creating art
was my true passion. However, I never felt a strong pull toward any one medium.
After dabbling in many different techniques and mediums, I moved away from fine
art toward a more practical approach and earned a degree in business. My business training is now proving vital in
my endeavors because it has prepared me to take my art to this next level.  Through conducting market research, writing a
business plan, managing cash flow, calculating investment needs, defining
my  market and  finding my products unique niche “Silk
Squirrel” is on its’ way!</p>
<p>After college, I went to work for an international
jewelry designer. My career was extremely rewarding – I was involved in all
aspects of jewelry design and creation, and traveled to many trade shows
across the US.  However, the travelling
and extreme time demand of meeting those fashion deadlines took a strain on my
husband and our new baby girl. Both my husband and I traveled for work, but
quality child care was scarce. We eventually realized that one of us needed to stay
home to care for our daughter and our new son. So I changed direction again,
earned my preschool certificate and opened my own child care and preschool center.
</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440389639/uxyjupbpayvc67ceb0rd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>That was over ten years ago. My child care endeavor has
been very successful and rewarding. But I needed something more. One night a
few years ago, I was invited to an adult art night to paint a silk scarf. I had
not painted for 15 years! <i>But when I
touched the dyes to the silk, something in me came alive!</i> It was like being
awakened after a long sleep. I couldn't stop painting! I had finally found my
art medium, and my wandering art spirit had found its true home! Never have I
felt so in tune with what I was meant to do.

<p>As I began silk painting for myself, exploring the medium
and the dyes and honing my art design skills, people and businesses started
ordering my art. The iridescence of the silk, the floppy squirrel hair brushes,
the texture of the fabric and the rich dye colors set themselves apart from any
other medium. I found that watercolor paper and canvas simply could not compete
with the versatility of silk. I would stay up all night in the calm of a quiet
house, designing and painting! I have since taken a few workshops from Master
Silk Artists from San Francisco, Washington and learned new ideas and
techniques at a specialized retreat in France. More recently, I have begun
teaching silk painting classes myself, as the Resident Artist at Yosemite for
the past two summers, at a week-long workshop in France, and at Eureka Studio
Arts.</p>

has the potential to be accessible to a much broader range of people in the
form of wearable silk art. As I began to redesign my painted wall art into
wearable silk art, I realized that I must find a way to increase the
production, because there are only so many hours in the day! I began
researching and sourcing how to edit and redesign my original artwork into a
wearable silk art form. The Silk Squirrel Wearable Art clothing line was born!<p></p><p>You are seeing samples of the textile designs after professional digital editing but before professional photography (see timeline below). These are my “proof

Silk Artists from San Francisco, Washington and learned new ideas and
techniques at a specialized retreat in France. More recently, I have begun
teaching silk painting classes myself, as the Resident Artist at Yosemite for
the past two summers, at a week-long workshop in France, and at Eureka Studio
Arts.
Much as I love the fine art world, I believe my artwork also
has the potential to be accessible to a much broader range of people in the
form of wearable silk art. As I began to redesign my painted wall art into
wearable silk art, I realized that I must find a way to increase the
production, because there are only so many hours in the day! I began
researching and sourcing how to edit and redesign my original artwork into a
wearable silk art form. The Silk Squirrel Wearable Art clothing line was born!You are seeing samples of the textile designs after professional digital editing but before professional photography (see timeline below). These are my “proof
of concept” first runs that are selling consistently.

""Details matter, it's worth waiting to get it right."" -Steve JobsEvery Venturi Belt comes with at least 5 inches of adjustability. You can adjust it bigger one day or smaller the next. The best thing about the Venturi Belt is: It can stay adjusted, but it's always adjustable.We at Venturi Belt Co. have designed the perfect belt. Adjustable but always adjusted so it is ready to go every time.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been living in Las Vegas for 15 years, raising my three daughters and working on all kinds of projects.  My daughters and female friends with smartphones complain about how to carry them  as well as ID and money without a purse.  I worked with jewelry people as well as doing market research with women to make different designs and start a fashion statement on this product.  It is now time to take it to the real world with your help.</p>
<p>I am a mechanical engineer that has worked in many fields, designing mobile gaming devices, TV sets, scuba equipment, you name it and I may have worked on it.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What The Idea Is:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Wear your smarphone as a fashion statement.  The bracelet can be worn with or without the optional smartphone case, allowing for mix and match combinations.  The smartphone case also holds your ID card as well as a debit/credit card.  Now you don't need a purse to carry your essentials, and also make a fashion statement with these unique designs.</p>
<p>A prototype has been built using 3D printers to ensure everything works correctly as designed.  8 different designs have been created and tested to make sure the modular design works and is sturdy.</p>
<p>Manufacturing of the injection molding tools needs to begin by mid November at the latest to allow the 8-10 weeks of cutting.  This will allow for parts to be pulled from the tools in mid January, 2013 and production parts by the end of January 2013.  Release is planned for mid February, 2013.  Tooling vendors in California as well as China are looking at prototypes right now to finalize costing.  Advertising will be done on the internet, art/craft shows, and working with shopping malls that show smartphone accesories.</p>
<p>The idea is under Patent Pending Status for design as well as utility with the U.S. Patent Office.</p>
<p>Money will be used to pay for tooling cost, patent attorney finalization, advertizing, and production parts.</p>

<p>Hey there! I've started dabbling with making polish and I love it! As a full-time new mommy, I don't have time to get a job so I decided I want to do something on the side. I love nail polish and have already made a few sales, but I don't have enough to continue going! With your help, I can get my business going strong and help provide for my family!</p>
<h3>WHAT I NEED!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>To get things started I will need $500 for suspension base (A polish base that suspends glitter instead of it falling to the bottom), solvent resistant glitters (These are glitters that will not contort, warp, bleed or dissolve in the polish base), pigments, micas and bottles! </p>
