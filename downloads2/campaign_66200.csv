Here's why:It shaves at the surface of your skin.Multi-blade razors are designed to shave below the surface of your skin, pulling hairs up and cutting them too close. This causes irritation and ingrown hairs. The Single Edge is designed to shave at the surface of your skin, providing a close, comfortable, and irritation-free shave.  It doesn't clog.Multi-blade razors clog with hair and shaving cream, causing annoyance, irritation and worse - bacterial growth. The Single Edge rinses clean easily and quickly.   It saves you money.The Single Edge is a bigger investment upfront, but costs fractions of the price in the long run. Here's how we stack up to the most popular shave club out there: After two years with the club, you end up paying twice as much for blades. And the pain only gets worse from there.  It's customizable to your unique preferences.Multi-blade razors are a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to shaving. But your skin and preferences are unique, so your razor should be too. That's why you can customize your shave with the Single Edge and it's three proprietary shave settings - Mild, Classic, and Aggressive.  Think of it like the clippers at your barbershop - change the setting to change how close you shave. If you have sensitive skin or short hair growth, the Mild setting is perfect for you. If you have a face of leather and wiry beard hair, go for Aggressive! The Classic setting is perfect for everyone in between.  Every razor ships with the Classic setting, and the UPGRADED razor ships with all three shave settings: Mild, Classic, and Aggressive. It's guaranteed for life.The Single Edge is engineered from 100% solid stainless steel. Which means it won't rust, won't break, and carries a lifetime guarantee to back it up.  Mutli-blade and single blade razors are made with cheap plastic and chrome-over-zamak construction. This means they break down over time and require replacement. There are no breakable parts on the Single Edge, which means it will last forever. It's an easier, more intuitive shave.Not all single blade razors are created equal. Many are intimidating to use for first timers: causing cuts, nicks and burns. That's why we created the Single Edge. It's the easiest way to begin shaving with a single blade. The hardest part of shaving with a single blade razor is finding the proper angle to hold it - and maintaining that angle through the shave. With the Single Edge, the right angle is already built in for you. Simply place the flat head against your skin and take short, light strokes.   It's a safer, faster blade load.All other single blade razors require you to unwrap and load thin, sharp blades by hand. Not with the Single Edge. Blade changes are lightning fast, dead simple, and touch free. Blades are 2X thickerOur blades are twice as thick as blades that are used in both multi-blade and single blade razors, which means they flex less, they cut cleaner, and they last longer.  No flex means no blade chatter, which is a common issue with both multi-blade and single blade razors - causing irritation, nicks, and cuts. Most users get anywhere from 5-10 shaves out of our blades.  After our very first campaign in 2015, we were able to not only launch the Single Edge but our company, Supply. Two years later, we’re back and ready to introduce the Single Edge 2.0. What’s new? Well, everything. A smoother, closer shave.We've shipped thousands of razors all over the world, and received invaluable feedback from our backers and customers. Using this feedback along with months of prototyping, we've increased the comfort and shaving efficiency of the Single Edge.  A razor's shaving qualities are determined by a number of important design decisions. However, the most important two factors are: (1) the distance between the blade and safety bar, and (2) the angle between the blade and safety bar.  These are commonly known as blade exposure and blade gap. We've optimized both the exposure and gap to provide an extremely close, yet comfortable shave - with all shave settings.   Brand new, cutting edge manufacturingFor 2.0, we're investing in a new, cutting edge manufacturing process: Metal Injection Molding. This process is a relatively new and promising one, typically used in medical device and aerospace manufacturing. It's an exciting, high-quality manufacturing technology that has extremely accurate tolerances - but a very high upfront investment cost. With your help, we can invest in the tooling to create the Single Edge with Metal Injection Molding.  It's back in black.Our number one customer request has been to produce a black version of the razor. Well - ask and ye shall receive. The Single Edge is back in our original matte and polished versions, but brand spanking new for 2.0 are our Matte Black and Jet Black finishes.   But this ain't no cheap spray painted black. We're using a military grade finish called Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) that is best known for it's use on Navy Seal watches. It's created by bombarding the surface of the razor with titanium ions inside a vacuum chamber.  
 This process not only imparts a smooth, deep black surface - it hardens and strengthens the underlying stainless steel, creating a new surface that is exceptionally scratch resistant.It comes in Matte Black: 
  And Jet Black:  We've squashed the bugs.We've listened to your other suggestions, and we're rolling those in too! We have a few more tricks up our sleeves, like smaller blade stops, improved blade loading, and upgraded packaging!   Not sure how this whole Indiegogo thing works? Read on.Preorder a Single Edge 2.0 through Indiegogo by selecting a perk tier of your choice. By ordering on Indiegogo, you will gain a special discount and receive your order before it is in stock on our site! All razor finishes and shave accessories scents will be selected when you check out. Delivery is expected in October of 2017, and your credit card will be charged at the time of preorder. Here are the perks:   The RazorThe Single Edge is designed in a simple, sturdy two piece construction - fastened by a screw/spring combination. The entire razor is 100% solid stainless steel, and is guaranteed for life against manufacturer's defects. Available in four finishes - Classic Matte, Mirror Polish, Matte Black, and Jet Black Military grade finish - typically used for Navy Seal watches Solid stainless steel construction - won't rust, won't break, and carries a lifetime guarantee to back it up. Mirror Polish and Jet Black The BladesThe blades used in our razor are called injector blades, and have been in production for almost a century. They are comfort coated, stainless steel, and more than twice as thick as today’s razor blades - lasting you twice as long. They can be easily purchased on Amazon, our website, or many beauty supply stores. Each razor ships with a magazine of 20 stainless steel, American-made injector blades. A pack of blades typically lasts up to SIX months and only cost $0.45 per blade to replace.  Fun fact - injector blades were the first invention of a young World War 1 US Army Colonel named Jacob Schick. Name sound familiar?   For the launch of the Single Edge 2.0, we're offering our Single Edge Starter Set at a discounted price. The Single Edge starter set comes with:

BRID's ceramic filter, which is permanently bound with doped nano Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), absorbs radiation from a precisely calibrated LED board and attacks pollutant molecules, breaking apart their chemical bonds and turning them into harmless substances. The typical drawback of photocatalytic purifiers is that they use UV light, which produces ozone, that is, in itself, a toxic air pollutant. By using LED visible lights only, thanks to our exclusive TiO2 recipe, BRID is the first truly ozone free photocatalytic air purifier.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575735674/lruq8r0vfbd3sct3zj6u.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Our patented ceramic filters</i></p><p><strong>BRID’s ceramic filters</strong> are the key components of L.E.A.P. Technology. Our <strong>trademark process</strong> permanently bounds doped TiO2 nano particles to a precisely engineered ceramic matrix. The porosity of the surface allows to multiply the active surface of the filter, ensuring an <strong>unprecedented efficiency</strong> for a filter this size. BRID's filters last 10 years, simply <strong>regenerate them with water</strong> to bring them back to their original state.</p><h3> </h3><h3>BRID vs. BACTERIA</h3><p>BRID XXL was placed in a 1,4 m3 hermetically sealed chamber and it was tested its efficiency against several bacterial strains using both SAS method (Surface Air System Sampler) and Settle Plate.

<p><strong>So, what's photocatalysis?</strong><br/>Photocatalysis is a reaction which uses light to increase the rate of a chemical reaction.</p>
<p>BRID's active ceramic element, which is permanently bound with our modified nano Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), absorbs radiation from our precisely calibrated LED board, producing<b> free radicals.</b> They then <b>attack pollutant</b> molecules, breaking apart their chemical bonds and <b>turning them into harmless substances.</b></p>
<p>BRID was developed in conjunction with <b>CE.RI.COL (Colorobbia Consulting research Center)</b>, a research lab specialized in innovative environmental research, a spin off of Colorobbia, a worldwide leader in the ceramic business. Prof. Giovanni Baldi holds over <b>25 Patents</b>, and many of them relate to <b>NanoTechnology</b>. </p>

<h2>BRID DRASTICALLY REDUCES FORMALDEHYDE</h2>

<p>Formaldehyde is an organic chemical that is commonly found in our environment. Formaldehyde is present in products such as chemicals, particle board, household products, glues, permanent press fabrics, paper product coatings, fiberboard and plywood. It is also widely used as an industrial fungicide, germicide, and disinfectant. It is a sensitizing agent that can cause an immune system response upon initial exposure. It is also a suspected human carcinogen that is linked to nasal cancer and lung cancer. </p>

<h3><strong>BRID VS. 3D PRINTER FUMES</strong></h3>
<p>In this quick brand new video you can see how BRID Air Purifier vaporizes toxic VOC. The real life experiment was done in the 3D printer room, which has a normal level of 1200ppm. BRID was let run for a few hours, lowering that level to 600ppm. At this point BRID was turned off and resin containers were opened for a while, then closed. The room reached a VOC level of 2300ppm. After settling, BRID was turned on again, bringing VOC levels impressively down to 600ppm again.<br/><br/><strong><i>Watch the quick timelapse video below </i></strong></p>

<p><strong>IS BRID 11V / 22V (WORLDWIDE) COMPATIBLE?</strong> <br/><br/>Yes, BRID's power supply will work all over the World.</p>
<p><br/><strong>WHAT TYPE OF POWER CABLE WILL I RECEIVE?</strong><br/><br/>Everyone will receive a power cable based on their country.<br/>We provide US, EU, UK and Australia type plugs. Hong Kong backers will receive U.K. plugs. Japanese backers will receive US plugs, etc</p>
<p><br/><strong>WHERE IS BRID MANUFACTURED AND WHEERE DOES IT SHIP FROM?</strong><br/><br/>BRID is entirely designed, engineered and manufactured in Italy. It will also ship from Italy.<br/>You are responsible for import taxes you might have to pay in your destination Country.</p>
<p><strong>CAN BRID REDUCE FORMALDEHYDE?</strong><br/><br/>The short answer is: ABSOLUTELY YES! <br/>What is formaldehyde? CH2O is a chemical widely used by several industries to make, for example, home building products. Aside from ALS risk or other nervous system consequences, formaldehyde is a respiratory irritant that causes chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, and nose and throat irritation. It can also cause cancer, and has been linked to an increased risk of asthma and allergies in kids. <br/>BRID’s ceramic honeycomb, as test results described below show, is a powerful tool against these risks. <br/>Photocatalytic decomposition of formaldehyde pollutant by ‘BRID’s doped’ ceramic honeycomb, activated with visible LED Light, has been tested to verify the effectiveness of BRID air purifier. Tests have been carried out in controlled conditions by using a flow of formaldehyde through a TiO2 ceramic honeycomb filter box highlighted by four LED light sources (visible light). HPLC has been used as final detector. <br/>Expected results: according to published research (Chemical engineering journal, 218 (2013), 9-18)), formaldehyde should been degraded by the presence of highly reactive radicals 2H+ and Hydroperoxyl produced on the surface of BRID’s activated honeycomb. <br/>Actual results: The chemical mechanism led to the transformation of formaldehyde into hydroxymethylperoxyl radicals which subsequently reacted with Hydroperoxyl giving rise to formic acid as byproduct (plus O2 and water). The presence of positive holes (2H+) is then responsible for the ""complete oxidation"" of formic acid into carbon dioxide (CO2) as final product of the whole process. <br/>Through this process the transformation of formaldehyde into carbon dioxide has been tested to have an impressive efficiency of 82,7% reduction in one single passage!</p>
<p><br/><strong>YOU SAID YOU PATENTED THE TECHNOLOGY. WHERE CAN I FOUND MORE INFORMATION?</strong><br/><br/>Here: <br/>WO2006/061367 del 6/12/2004: “Process for preparing dispersions of TiO2 and dispersions obtainable with this process and functionalization of these surfaces by application of TiO2 dispersions”; Baldi et al. <br/>WO2207/088151 del 01/02/2006: “Method of preparation of aqueous dispersion of TiO2 in the form of nanoparticles and dispersions obtainable with this method"" Baldi et al. <br/>WO2012/085950 del 22/12/2010: “Device for reducing pollutants in a gas mixture”; Baldi et al. <br/>(IT) 102017000050577: “Supporto nanofunzionalizzato e metodo di realizzazione” Baldi et al.</p>
<p><br/><strong>CAN I USE 4 OR MORE POWER FILTER MODULES?</strong><br/><br/>Nope. BRID is calibrated to use up to three power filter modules. If you use 4 or more power filters, BRID just won't work.</p>
<p><br/><strong>CAN YOU MAKE SOME EXAMPLES OF ORGANIC ODORS?</strong><br/><br/>Organic odors might include smoke, pet urine, bodily fluids, cooking odors, Odors from organic compounds found in general air pollution, wastewater, soil emissions and building emissions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>AN EXPLANATION, SOME LITERATURE AND A LIST OF 'SOME' OF THE VOC (VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS)</strong><br/><br/>BRID deal very well with VOCs, as photocatalysis eventually transforms them into VO2 and vapor. VOCs are one of the main reason for pollution in cities (Together with NOx, where Diesel engines are present in large numbers). Here a short list of the main VOCs: <br/>Ethylhexanol <br/>Dichloroethyl ethyl ether <br/>Dodecanol <br/>Methenamine <br/>Nonanol <br/>Trimethylpentanediol monoiosobutyrate BHT <br/>Methyl pyrrolidinone <br/>Acetic acid <br/>Acetonitrile <br/>Ethyl toluene <br/>Benzene <br/>Chlorobenzene <br/>Butoxyethanol <br/>Dichloroethane <br/>Phenol <br/>Trimethylpentanediol diisobutyrate Caprolactam <br/>Triethylamine <br/>Undecane <br/>Trimethyl benzene <br/>Formaldehyde <br/>Acetaldehyde <br/>Benzaldehyde <br/>Dodecane <br/>Naphthalene <br/>Here's is also a NOAA study from 2012: <br/><a href=""http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2012/20120809_laairqualitystudy.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2012/201208...</a> <br/>and some more documentation. <br/><a href=""https://www.treehugger.com/fossil-fuels/las-pollution-car-exhaust-down-98-60s.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.treehugger.com/fossil-fuels/las-pol...</a> <br/>One of VOC's problems is that it generates ozone. <br/>Interestingly BRID is the only PCO Purifier that does not produce ozone, on top, of course, of being able to 'Vaporize' it. Why? Because all PCO purifiers use UV lights and they produce ozone, while BRID's patented technology uses, for the first time, visible light, the only way to avoid ozone production.</p>
<p><br/><strong>WHAT IS BRID'S EFFECT ON VIRUSES?</strong><br/><br/>Brid's effect on specific viruses is still undergoing testing. We will post detailed results as soon as they will be available.</p>
<p><br/><strong>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PCO TECHNOLOGY AND BRID'S TECHNOLOGY?</strong><br/><br/>The principle is the same, but BRID, unlike PCO uses a series of patented processes, such as visible light, opposed to UV Light, used by all the others, which produces toxic ozone in various quantities. BRID is the only commercial purifier that uses Visible Light, therefore not producing ozone at all. BRID is also the only purifier of this kind that uses washable filters (Another patent), making it virtually endless. BRID is also modular and can be scaled and adapted easily. Last but not least, competitors have a staring price ranging from $600 to $800. BRID starts at less than $300, 1/2 the price of the nearest competitor, despite BRID's multiple performance advantages.</p>
<p><br/><strong>FROM A SUPPORTER (AMEET): ""HOW DOES YOUR TECHNOLOGY COMPARE TO MOLEKULE?""</strong><br/><br/>The long list of why BRID stand out when compared to others (Tedious read, but explanatory):</p>
<p>""We have not had a chance to review Molukule, or other similar products, mainly because our approach is much more technical and our goals also included trying to make consumers save money on the dreaded consumables. <br/>From the information that is publicly available and various spec sheets we're able to list a series of clear advantages that BRID has over most, if not all, similar purifiers (some advantages might be in common with others, but certainly not all): <br/>- BRID uses visible light to achieve the same result as others, therefore it does not produce toxic ozone. I believe all the others use either UV-C or UV-A light. UV-A is better than UV-C, but, as far as we know it still produces small quantities of ozone. BRID plays in a different league here, as our target was to get rid of both UV-A and UV-C. Keep in mind that the honeycomb has been in the works for several years and that the research group is deeply involved in both ceramic and nano particles (The patents explain well how much research is behind it). <br/>- BRID uses a nano ceramic non traditional filter. Our modified TiO2 is baked and bonded to the honeycomb. This is done so that particles cannot escape it. Most, if not all other filters are conventional ones and while we did not test them, we can only assume that TiO2 particles will be airborne right from the moment you turn them on. We believe BRID has a massive advantage over older / traditional filter technology as the honeycomb was thought with the volatility of TiO2 particles in mind. We wanted them bonded forever to the filter right from the start. <br/>- When it comes to pricing, well, obviously BRID is less expensive than competitors, at least during the Kickstarter campaign <br/>- Consumables is one more BRID's massive advantage. Contrary to other similar filters BRID can we washed and re-used over and over again. I believe that competitors today will charge you from $100 / year to several 100s for changing filters. They also become less effective with time (They lose TiO2, while BRID does not). On top of that, changing filter once a year for $100 is a good guess, but is it really how often you should do that? With BRID you can choose to simply clean it as many times you want without spending an extra dime. <br/>- BRID's modular design is unique and can easily adapt to different spaces and needs. It can also be upgraded by changing modules. We put some thought into not having to trash the entire unit and waste a lot of $$$ in case of upgrades. I do not believe any other similar purifier does that. We definitively put some love into it. <br/>- Last, but not least, BRID's honeycomb is covered by several patents (Cited in the campaign), so there's some work to do for others to catch up :)""</p>
<p><br/><strong>HOW DOES BRID DEAL WITH MOLD?</strong><br/><br/>BRID will get rid of mold spores that go through the filtration system, therefore it will get rid or drastically reduce common allergy symptoms such as wheezing, rash, watery eyes, runny nose, itchy eyes, etc. BRID's nanoceramic filter will effectively stop spores germination.</p>

<p><strong>Chris</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>I'm reaching out to say that I've received the BRIDs, and have tried them. It's pretty impressive, I had some durian over the weekend. Naturally the smell had to permeate into my bedroom. I switched on the BRID and after about 15-20 minutes, it noticeably reduced the intensity of the smell between my bedroom and my living room.</i></p>
<p><i>In addition, last night was the first night my wife didn't toss and turn, and seemed to be breathing easier – so much that I noticed a significant reduction in her snoring. Hopefully, it will help stave off her bouts of eczema too.</i></p>
<p><i>I just wanted to reach out and thank you for everything, and that I would be unbashedly recommending BRID to anyone that asks for an air purifier.</i></p>

WHY BRID IS A BETTER AIR PURIFIER
- BRID doesn't merely trap pollutants, like almost every other air purifier on the market do. Thanks to our proprietary L.E.A.P. Technology (Led Enabled Advanced Photocatalysis), it 'vaporizes' them, transforming them into harmless substances.
- BRID has proved effective against different classes of pollutants, regardless of their size. It will reduce VOCs (like formaldehyde), bacteria (both gram-positive and gram-negative), PMs (as small as 0.3 um), allergens, mold spores, NOx and odors. 
- BRID's multi-patented ceramic filters last up to 10 years, so you don't have to worry about replacing them. That's right: no recurring costs. This will save you hundreds of dollars/year.
- BRID is the first photocatalytic air purified that uses visible LED light instead of UV (UV-A, UV-B or UV-C). It does NOT generate any ozone.
- BRID's efficacy has been certified by some of the most respected independent labs in Europe.  
THOUSANDS OF UNITS ALREADY DELIVERED WORLDWIDEREAD MORE OF OUR REAL FEEDBACK FROM VERIFIED CUSTOMERS IN DEPTH: HOW DOES IT WORKBRID uses a powerful cleaning technology called Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO). BRID's ceramic filter, which is permanently bound with doped nano Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), absorbs radiation from a precisely calibrated LED board and attacks pollutant molecules, breaking apart their chemical bonds and turning them into harmless substances. The typical drawback of photocatalytic purifiers is that they use UV light, which produces ozone, that is, in itself, a toxic air pollutant. By using LED visible lights only, thanks to our exclusive TiO2 recipe, BRID is the first truly ozone free photocatalytic air purifier.Our patented ceramic filtersBRID’s ceramic filters are the key components of L.E.A.P. Technology. Our trademark process permanently bounds doped TiO2 nano particles to a precisely engineered ceramic matrix. The porosity of the surface allows to multiply the active surface of the filter, ensuring an unprecedented efficiency for a filter this size. BRID's filters last 10 years, simply regenerate them with water to bring them back to their original state. BRID vs. BACTERIABRID XXL was placed in a 1,4 m3 hermetically sealed chamber and it was tested its efficiency against several bacterial strains using both SAS method (Surface Air System Sampler) and Settle Plate. It was observed a clear reduction of bacterial levels during these lab tests that can only be attributed to the use of the product, more specifically, the bacteria reduction has been observed on all strand of microorganisms tested. Down below, a photographic evidences of different petri dishes before and after a continued use of BRID XXL. 3 SIZES, 3 COLORS BRID vs. HEPA FILTERS CUSTOMER VIDEO REVIEW THE FULL STORYBRID uses a powerful cleaning technology called Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO). The same technology is used, for example, by NASA. BRID is not a mere conventional filter, think of it as a 'Cold' furnace that burns pollution, bacteria, odors, etc. and generates vapor and CO2 as a byproduct. It's as simple as that.BRID's patented innovation does not use UV light, unlike all other PCO purifiers do. The advantage of this patent is the absence of ozone as a byproduct. Only BRID offers this breakthrough technological leap.BRID does not merely trap pollutants, bacteria, etc. It 'vaporizes' them through photocatalysis (PCO), which is an extremely efficient and effective process.BRID is the only PCO purifier that offers washable filters! It does not require to replace very expensive filters (PCO Filters cost more than $100 each and up to $200) , making it the least costly PCO purifier in the world!BRID has an exclusive, patented ceramic module which allows nano particles to be 'Baked' permanently into the core, preventing them to escape the filter. No other PCO purifier does that.BRID is the only smart modular PCO purifier on the market.BRID is offered at approx. 50% less than retail price during this campaign. Comparable, less advanced, conventional PCO products cost twice as much, or more than BRID.BRID is designed in Italy, it's compact and a powerful high tech air cleaner. 
BRID'S EXCLUSIVE PATENTS
WO2006061367 - Process for preparing dispersions of tio2 in the form of nanoparticles, and dispersions obtainable with this process and functionalization of surfaces by application of tio2 dispersionsWO2007088151 - Method for the preparation of aqueous dispersions of tio2 in the form of nanoparticles, and dispersions obtainable with this methodWO2012085950 - Device for reducing pollutants in a gas mixture - (IT) 102017000050577 (Approved as of Sep. 2017)  MORE IN DETAIL - HOW DOES BRID WORK?THE TECHNOLOGYBRID’s high tech Nano Ceramic Honeycomb Filter uses Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), which has been modified (Trade secret) in order to work with LED visible light. TiO2, through a well known and a scientifically well documented process (PCO), purifies the air, and that’s where BRID truly excels compared to literally any other purifier, making good use of several patented technological breakthroughs and without generating toxic Ozone, like others do. WHY YOU WILL NEVER NEED TO REPLACE BRID'S FILTERBRID is also the only purifier using ceramic filters where TiO2 is ""Baked"" into the filter, so nano particles never escape into the environment. The baking process also guarantees the virtually unlimited life of BRID's amazing ceramic honeycomb filter. Other, less advanced PCO purifiers have to necessarily replace their filters from time to time, just like inkjet printers, substantially increasing ownership costs. These filters are typically very expensive to replace, while BRID runs without the need to replace filters! Fits Beautifully In Every Environment Thanks To 5 Different Color Combinations
 THE DIFFERENCE COMPARED TO OTHER PURIFIERS​BRID is the result of over 13 years of development. BRID is the only commercial purifier that uses a Nano Ceramic Core Filter and LED visible light, hence the only photocatalytic high tech purifier that does not generate harmful ozone! While other PCO purifiers mainly use the same outdated Technology (With UV light) necessarily generating unwanted ozone.  Media Talking About BRID AIR PURIFIER    Clever Italian Engineering
 BRID'S CORE ELEMENT: NANO CERAMIC FILTERThe unique and ingeniously designed honeycomb structure, covered by 4 patents and its porous ceramic surface, treated with our modified TiO2 (Titanium Dioxide), is obtained through a meticulously calibrated heat treatment and then modified (doped) with a gas (Patent pending process). LED BOARD84 high quality cool white LEDs, arranged in 6 rows, light each ceramic filter from the top and bottom, starting the Clean Photocatalysis reaction WITHOUT generating any ozone. LED lights have a guaranteed life of several years, longer than conventional UV lights. BRID's innovative modular Italian design allows for single elements to be replaced without any technical knowledge. We designed BRID thinking about end users. THE FANA super silent, 42 Db, white noise and low consumption fan (air flow of 7.600 Ft³ - 215 m³/h) pulls in the polluted air at 360˚. Quiet library -> 40 Db Normal Conversation -> 60 Db Vacuum Cleaner -> 74 DbNWF FILTERA NWF (Non woven Fabric) filter at the bottom of the base blocks large particles like pollen, dander and dust. The prototype uses an inexpensive pre-filter, but the final production version will be equipped with a washable pre-filter, just like the nano ceramic filter, therefore you will not need to purchase additional consumables.WORKS WORLDWIDE (110/220 VOLTS)BRID's power supply works worldwide (110 / 220 v.) and an accessory will allow you to use it even in your car (24 v.), making it a the perfect companion for commuting in heavy traffic or polluted cities. BRID Air Is An Amazingly Powerful Nanotechnology Purifier
 

 
 
BRID's main component 
The unique modular configuration lets BRID adapt to your needs and by simply adding a second power filter module (BRID XL) or a third power filter module (BRID XXL), it can speed up the cleaning process or deal with larger environments. Its ground breaking technology makes BRID the best solution when it comes to eliminating indoor pollution.
 

 
Once BRID has cleaned the entire room, it automatically adjusts to maintain the air pure and fresh and intervenes when the environment is once more altered by external causes.
 
LESS WASTE & FUTURE UPGRADES
BRID's distinctive configuration allows future upgrades to be easily implementable and inexpensive. We plant to develop BRID and we don't want you to throw away perfectly functioning components. Using this approach, we placed the hardware in the base making it is less likely to become outdated. The base is the only module you'll have to replace when future versions of BRID are available.

 
 

 
 

 
The working heart of the C.PC. (Clean Photocatalysis / PCO) technology is the revolutionary honeycomb-shaped ceramic filter. The Nanotechnology engineered ceramic filter is made of porous ceramic surface meticulously designed utilizing the latest technologies to create a designed nano structured filter, making it extremely effective, durable and 100% safe.
 
The Revolutionionary Patented Nano Ceramic Module
 
EASY MAINTENANCE - NO NEED TO REPLACE MESSY AND EXPENSIVE FILTERS!
To make the ceramic filter good as new, just rinse it under tap water, let it dry and put it back in. There’s never been such a complete and user friendly air-purifier.
 
 
Clean BRID's Filter In Seconds! No Expensive Replacements Necessary
 
 

 
So, what's photocatalysis?Photocatalysis is a reaction which uses light to increase the rate of a chemical reaction.
BRID's active ceramic element, which is permanently bound with our modified nano Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), absorbs radiation from our precisely calibrated LED board, producing free radicals. They then attack pollutant molecules, breaking apart their chemical bonds and turning them into harmless substances.
BRID was developed in conjunction with CE.RI.COL (Colorobbia Consulting research Center), a research lab specialized in innovative environmental research, a spin off of Colorobbia, a worldwide leader in the ceramic business. Prof. Giovanni Baldi holds over 25 Patents, and many of them relate to NanoTechnology. 
 
the brain behind BRID and owner of over 25 Patents
 
Tests have shown when used indoors, over 90% of the VOCs (volatile organic compounds), outdoor pollution, odors that are commonly found in homes and offices are removed. 
TECHNOLOGIES COMPARED: BRID VS CONVENTIONAL CONSUMER AIR PURIFIERS
 

 
 

 
BRID IS THE ONLY HIGHLY EFFICIENT PURIFIER THAT IS TRULY OZONE FREE. All other known commercial purifiers use different spectrums of UV light, which are scientifically known to produce different degrees of toxic ozone. When others claim to be ozone free, their refer to ""Acceptable"", as their UV Light will produce it. The only way to not produce toxic Ozone is to use visible light, like BRID uniquely does.
 
 

 

 
01 — Blending In 
Place BRID wherever you like. With its sleek design it blends in perfectly no matter where you put it. Plug it in and begin to enjoy its patented Clean Photocatalysis technology purifying the air.

02 — Pulling In
The air’s journey begins as BRID’s silent fan channels the air through its first phase: an NWF (non-woven fabric) filter. This filter begins the purification process by blocking the larger particles such as pollen, dander and dust. Now half of the air is refreshingly clean.

03 — Pushing Through
Now the air passes through its second filter and our Clean Photocatalysis technology is implemented. The ceramic filter is activated by 84 visible LED lights.
 

 
04 — Breaking Down 
Our modified Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), presented in our ceramic filter, absorbs radiation from our precisely calibrated LED board, producing free radicals. They then attack pollutant molecules, breaking apart their chemical bonds and turning them into harmless substances.

05 — That's it
BRID is now taking care of your environment. In a matter of minutes, the air in your room will be cleaner and enjoy bacteria reduction and nasty odors as well.

06 — Need more?


Have a bigger room? Add more power filter modules with ease and begin to notice the difference fresh air can make. Need to clean your filter? It’s easier than you think, with no tools required for adding or removing ceramic filters. Simply pass your filters under running water.
 
 

 
 
BRID's LAB TEST RESULTS (Explained Below)
 

 
BRID DRASTICALLY REDUCES FORMALDEHYDE
 

Formaldehyde is an organic chemical that is commonly found in our environment. Formaldehyde is present in products such as chemicals, particle board, household products, glues, permanent press fabrics, paper product coatings, fiberboard and plywood. It is also widely used as an industrial fungicide, germicide, and disinfectant. It is a sensitizing agent that can cause an immune system response upon initial exposure. It is also a suspected human carcinogen that is linked to nasal cancer and lung cancer. 
 
BRID's effect on formaldehyde was tested with a single activated filter in lab conditions. The results have show a 82,7% Formaldehyde depletion in one cycle.

NOX REDUCTION CERTIFICATION
BRID was tested and certified by our exclusive partner CE.RI.COL (Colorobbia Consulting research Center), member of Colorobbia Group in Florence, Italy.
Ce.Ri.Col (Colorobbia Consulting research Center) plays a major role in the continuous research of the synthesis of nanoparticles, which has been a part of the world of ceramics for over a century, but has also always conducted research and analysis of chemicals, outdoors.
 
 
 

Actual BRID Lab Test Result 

 
The test was carried out by placing BRID, BRID XL and BRID XXL in a (35 ft³ / 1 m³) computer monitored test box and polluting the air inside with a controlled amount of Pollutants (NOx) at a 100 ppb concentration, above the legal limit.  
The measurement was taken using chemiluminescence technology with the Thermo Model 42i, at a sampling interval of 10 s for 90 minutes. The graph above shows the rate at which the pollution was reduced for all three configurations of the product.
 

 
 
CARBON MONOXIDE REDUCTION CERTIFICATION
BRID's effect on Carbon Monoxide was tested and evaluated by the independent lab Micro-B srl.
A BRID XXL with three power modules was placed in a 17 ft³ / 0.5 m³ test box that was filled with Carbon Monoxide using a gasoline-powered automobile. Our laboratory used a Carbon Monoxide measurement device with a 1ppm resolution, collecting data every 10 minutes for the first 4 hours, and every 20 minutes for the remaining 11 hours.
The concentration of Carbon Monoxide decreased at an exponential rate reducing it by half in approximately 3 hours, showing that a continued use of BRID does indeed lessen the threat of Carbon Monoxide gas in indoor environments, adding precious minutes in case of emergencies.

PRE-FILTER
We use a G4 non-woven fabric pre-filter that blocks pollen, dust, dander and particulate matter as small as 0.5 µm. This filter should be a washable filter in the final version, making it totally inexpensive.

BRID VS. 3D PRINTER FUMES
In this quick brand new video you can see how BRID Air Purifier vaporizes toxic VOC. The real life experiment was done in the 3D printer room, which has a normal level of 1200ppm. BRID was let run for a few hours, lowering that level to 600ppm. At this point BRID was turned off and resin containers were opened for a while, then closed. The room reached a VOC level of 2300ppm. After settling, BRID was turned on again, bringing VOC levels impressively down to 600ppm again.Watch the quick timelapse video below

WHAT TYPE OF POWER CABLE WILL I RECEIVE?Everyone will receive a power cable based on their country.We provide US, EU, UK and Australia type plugs. Hong Kong backers will receive U.K. plugs. Japanese backers will receive US plugs, etc
WHERE IS BRID MANUFACTURED AND WHEERE DOES IT SHIP FROM?BRID is entirely designed, engineered and manufactured in Italy. It will also ship from Italy.You are responsible for import taxes you might have to pay in your destination Country.
CAN BRID REDUCE FORMALDEHYDE?The short answer is: ABSOLUTELY YES! What is formaldehyde? CH2O is a chemical widely used by several industries to make, for example, home building products. Aside from ALS risk or other nervous system consequences, formaldehyde is a respiratory irritant that causes chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing, and nose and throat irritation. It can also cause cancer, and has been linked to an increased risk of asthma and allergies in kids. BRID’s ceramic honeycomb, as test results described below show, is a powerful tool against these risks. Photocatalytic decomposition of formaldehyde pollutant by ‘BRID’s doped’ ceramic honeycomb, activated with visible LED Light, has been tested to verify the effectiveness of BRID air purifier. Tests have been carried out in controlled conditions by using a flow of formaldehyde through a TiO2 ceramic honeycomb filter box highlighted by four LED light sources (visible light). HPLC has been used as final detector. Expected results: according to published research (Chemical engineering journal, 218 (2013), 9-18)), formaldehyde should been degraded by the presence of highly reactive radicals 2H+ and Hydroperoxyl produced on the surface of BRID’s activated honeycomb. Actual results: The chemical mechanism led to the transformation of formaldehyde into hydroxymethylperoxyl radicals which subsequently reacted with Hydroperoxyl giving rise to formic acid as byproduct (plus O2 and water). The presence of positive holes (2H+) is then responsible for the ""complete oxidation"" of formic acid into carbon dioxide (CO2) as final product of the whole process. Through this process the transformation of formaldehyde into carbon dioxide has been tested to have an impressive efficiency of 82,7% reduction in one single passage!
YOU SAID YOU PATENTED THE TECHNOLOGY. WHERE CAN I FOUND MORE INFORMATION?Here: WO2006/061367 del 6/12/2004: “Process for preparing dispersions of TiO2 and dispersions obtainable with this process and functionalization of these surfaces by application of TiO2 dispersions”; Baldi et al. WO2207/088151 del 01/02/2006: “Method of preparation of aqueous dispersion of TiO2 in the form of nanoparticles and dispersions obtainable with this method"" Baldi et al. WO2012/085950 del 22/12/2010: “Device for reducing pollutants in a gas mixture”; Baldi et al. (IT) 102017000050577: “Supporto nanofunzionalizzato e metodo di realizzazione” Baldi et al.
CAN I USE 4 OR MORE POWER FILTER MODULES?Nope. BRID is calibrated to use up to three power filter modules. If you use 4 or more power filters, BRID just won't work.
CAN YOU MAKE SOME EXAMPLES OF ORGANIC ODORS?Organic odors might include smoke, pet urine, bodily fluids, cooking odors, Odors from organic compounds found in general air pollution, wastewater, soil emissions and building emissions.
 
AN EXPLANATION, SOME LITERATURE AND A LIST OF 'SOME' OF THE VOC (VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS)BRID deal very well with VOCs, as photocatalysis eventually transforms them into VO2 and vapor. VOCs are one of the main reason for pollution in cities (Together with NOx, where Diesel engines are present in large numbers). Here a short list of the main VOCs: Ethylhexanol Dichloroethyl ethyl ether Dodecanol Methenamine Nonanol Trimethylpentanediol monoiosobutyrate BHT Methyl pyrrolidinone Acetic acid Acetonitrile Ethyl toluene Benzene Chlorobenzene Butoxyethanol Dichloroethane Phenol Trimethylpentanediol diisobutyrate Caprolactam Triethylamine Undecane Trimethyl benzene Formaldehyde Acetaldehyde Benzaldehyde Dodecane Naphthalene Here's is also a NOAA study from 2012: http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2012/201208... and some more documentation. https://www.treehugger.com/fossil-fuels/las-pol... One of VOC's problems is that it generates ozone. Interestingly BRID is the only PCO Purifier that does not produce ozone, on top, of course, of being able to 'Vaporize' it. Why? Because all PCO purifiers use UV lights and they produce ozone, while BRID's patented technology uses, for the first time, visible light, the only way to avoid ozone production.
WHAT IS BRID'S EFFECT ON VIRUSES?Brid's effect on specific viruses is still undergoing testing. We will post detailed results as soon as they will be available.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PCO TECHNOLOGY AND BRID'S TECHNOLOGY?The principle is the same, but BRID, unlike PCO uses a series of patented processes, such as visible light, opposed to UV Light, used by all the others, which produces toxic ozone in various quantities. BRID is the only commercial purifier that uses Visible Light, therefore not producing ozone at all. BRID is also the only purifier of this kind that uses washable filters (Another patent), making it virtually endless. BRID is also modular and can be scaled and adapted easily. Last but not least, competitors have a staring price ranging from $600 to $800. BRID starts at less than $300, 1/2 the price of the nearest competitor, despite BRID's multiple performance advantages.
FROM A SUPPORTER (AMEET): ""HOW DOES YOUR TECHNOLOGY COMPARE TO MOLEKULE?""The long list of why BRID stand out when compared to others (Tedious read, but explanatory):
""We have not had a chance to review Molukule, or other similar products, mainly because our approach is much more technical and our goals also included trying to make consumers save money on the dreaded consumables. From the information that is publicly available and various spec sheets we're able to list a series of clear advantages that BRID has over most, if not all, similar purifiers (some advantages might be in common with others, but certainly not all): - BRID uses visible light to achieve the same result as others, therefore it does not produce toxic ozone. I believe all the others use either UV-C or UV-A light. UV-A is better than UV-C, but, as far as we know it still produces small quantities of ozone. BRID plays in a different league here, as our target was to get rid of both UV-A and UV-C. Keep in mind that the honeycomb has been in the works for several years and that the research group is deeply involved in both ceramic and nano particles (The patents explain well how much research is behind it). - BRID uses a nano ceramic non traditional filter. Our modified TiO2 is baked and bonded to the honeycomb. This is done so that particles cannot escape it. Most, if not all other filters are conventional ones and while we did not test them, we can only assume that TiO2 particles will be airborne right from the moment you turn them on. We believe BRID has a massive advantage over older / traditional filter technology as the honeycomb was thought with the volatility of TiO2 particles in mind. We wanted them bonded forever to the filter right from the start. - When it comes to pricing, well, obviously BRID is less expensive than competitors, at least during the Kickstarter campaign - Consumables is one more BRID's massive advantage. Contrary to other similar filters BRID can we washed and re-used over and over again. I believe that competitors today will charge you from $100 / year to several 100s for changing filters. They also become less effective with time (They lose TiO2, while BRID does not). On top of that, changing filter once a year for $100 is a good guess, but is it really how often you should do that? With BRID you can choose to simply clean it as many times you want without spending an extra dime. - BRID's modular design is unique and can easily adapt to different spaces and needs. It can also be upgraded by changing modules. We put some thought into not having to trash the entire unit and waste a lot of $$$ in case of upgrades. I do not believe any other similar purifier does that. We definitively put some love into it. - Last, but not least, BRID's honeycomb is covered by several patents (Cited in the campaign), so there's some work to do for others to catch up :)""
HOW DOES BRID DEAL WITH MOLD?BRID will get rid of mold spores that go through the filtration system, therefore it will get rid or drastically reduce common allergy symptoms such as wheezing, rash, watery eyes, runny nose, itchy eyes, etc. BRID's nanoceramic filter will effectively stop spores germination.
 
BRID REVIEWS
Does BRID really work? Here's a selection of public REAL comments we received.
 
I just received my BRID today and am very happy it works as advertised, thank you for making such a premium device and following through!
Evander
 
Hi guys, I unexpectedly received my brid today. The unit exceeds my expectations on build quality and am excited to get it going.
Randy
 
Hi Atellani, I have received my BRID. Everything you promised is true. Beautiful design, no noise on night-mode, works perfect.
Hielke
 
The Brid itself seems to work very good. It seems to do its work, I have had less problems with my allergy after having it on for a few nights in the bedroom.
Joel
 
Love the product, still amazed I haven't snored since I got it, since I was pretty bad after a couple of drinks it's been very popular with my partner.
Chris
 
I'm reaching out to say that I've received the BRIDs, and have tried them. It's pretty impressive, I had some durian over the weekend. Naturally the smell had to permeate into my bedroom. I switched on the BRID and after about 15-20 minutes, it noticeably reduced the intensity of the smell between my bedroom and my living room.
In addition, last night was the first night my wife didn't toss and turn, and seemed to be breathing easier – so much that I noticed a significant reduction in her snoring. Hopefully, it will help stave off her bouts of eczema too.
I just wanted to reach out and thank you for everything, and that I would be unbashedly recommending BRID to anyone that asks for an air purifier.
ZhanHao
 
Hello Roberto, received my BRID yesterday, already very impressed, so much so that family want one too.
Giselle
 
Hey guys, I'd just like to say I am very much enjoying my 2 BRID XL's so far. I have a cat and live on a busy street in Chicago and there is a noticeable difference in air quality after having run them for about a week. The BRID team's hard work and dedication is so much appreciated! It looks beautiful and seems to be working.
William
 
The BRID arrived Friday and I must say that industrial design, materials quality, fit and finish are all outstanding, especially considering that my unit's serial number is 011. The tactile feedback of the switch, the color temperature of the staged lighting, the overall weight of the purifier, the texture of the no fingerprint metal finish all speak to the considerable thought that went into its outstanding design. As you say in Italy, bravo!
Thomas
 
Hello to all, after almost 10 working days, I can say that it definitely works. The air quality is improved.
Fabio
 
Every morning for 21 years my wife sneezes 8-12 times in a row without fail. From the first night my BRID was installed, she has not sneezed again in 5 days!
Chris
 
The brids are AMAZING and they integrate with HomeKit really well. […] I can say that my wife and I have really noticed a difference. We just moved to a new place and our allergies were killing us.
Clay
 
Received my 3 Brids today. […] They look beautiful, the setup was ultimately smooth. I don't have other Homekit devices, so it may be standard for them, however I own many other 'smart' devices and Brid was the first to pick my wifi settings automatically, impressive.
Alexey
 
The Brid works very well it would appear: my girlfriend's sinuses are now unblocked, so congratulations for that! […] Thank you.
John
 
Just received my Brid and I can say it worth the wait and the money. One of my rooms had very bad air problems but after 1 day of full use the air is clean and breathable. Brid is amazing! Thanks for the amazing job!
Daniel
 
My only regret is not getting 2. Thanks Atellani!

BETA TESTER FEEDBACKS
We sent out one of our latest prototypes and a beta version of BRID’s app to one of our backers in Australia, “D.”. [His feedback is absolutely unbiased: we haven’t met him, he offered his help and we were absolutely open to criticism.]
""We already love our Brid! """"Brid looks like a piece of finely-crafted Italian furniture (my wife words). We cannot wait to see what the deep blue one’s look like.""""Brid feels like it’s made of solid premium materials (even with the temporary plastic components). It’s sounds weird but its a pleasure to run your hands along the metal body.""""My wife said that the air in our family room feels so much “cleaner” now. “Feeling cleaner” was a pleasant surprise.""""Brid cleans the air so quickly. I have conducted a number of tests (by spraying around lots of bug spray) and it detects the change in air quality within 30 seconds and cleans the air within 10-15 minutes.""""Brid is very quiet, even in “Boost” mode. At times, I have forgetten it’s working.""""Brid’s app is intuitive. It’s much more complete than I had expected. Another pleasant surprise.""""Brid's power cable is long. So many companies include short cables and that’s totally impractical.""

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Most pro LED photo and video lights are harsh and specular, unless diffused to within an inch of their life. Mighty. mini. uses Patent Pending LEDNatural technology to produce the smoothest, most natural LED lighting you have ever seen. The Mighty. mini. side-mounted LED lights are diffused multiple times before they light your subject. You won't get the typical squints, fake grins and hot spots that you get with conventional rear-mounted LED panels. In the case of the Mighty mini, soft luscious light does not equal low power. Mighty. mini. uses only high-grade Samsung daylight and tungsten balanced LED chips rated at over 50 lumens per LED. In fact, Mighty mini delivers almost as much power as a 300 watt incandescent bulb. These LED chips also have a high CRI (&gt;=85) providing natural and vivid color rendition.</span><br/></p>

<p><br/><b>Q:</b> How do you measure lumens?

We are reporting the total amount of light output from the LEDs themselves, inside the light chamber, prior to the diffusion technology.<br/><br/>If you buy an LED light bulb in any regular store you will see a Lumens rating (not lux). We think this is the best rating method to use for our lights because it is the most common, and is the best understood by the average consumer. If you know how bright a ""60 watt"" 800 Lumen LED bulb you bought at Wal-Mart is, you can probably make a reasonable inference about a higher Lumen rating. <br/><br/>You are probably seeing some other LED manufacturers use a Lux measurement which needs to include a specific distance. Lux more or less tells you how intense a light beam is at a specific point, at a specific distance. I'm not sure why some manufacturers use this measurement, but it doesn't really tell you a lot. A very narrow beam of light (e.g., a flashlight could have a very high lux, but low lumens). I highly doubt you would want to use a flashlight to light your subject though. <br/><br/>One of the reasons our LEDNatural technology is so special is precisely because our technology has a 120 degree coverage area, whereas, most traditional LED panels only have a 60 degree coverage area. In this scenario, a 60 degree LED light panel could conceivably measure higher on a Lux reading than a panel with a 120 degree area of coverage, but actually put out less light (Lumens). Hope some of this makes sense.<br/><br/>In short, its apples to oranges. We choose to report the more common measure of LED brightness.<br/><br/></p>

Our Project:

Thanks for checking out our project! This project has been incredible. Here at ColorRight, we've been making awesome white balance tools and flash diffusers for over 5 years. We've even won awards for our ColorRight PRO line of color balance tools.



The Mighty. mini. is a revolutionary type of LED lighting for both Photo and Video. The Mighty. mini. triple purpose light is softer (LEDNatural technology), thinner (.5"") , lighter (12 ounces) and more flexible (triple purpose) than any conventional LED photo or video light. You can use the Mighty. mini. as a revolutionary continuous cool light source, a handheld light source, or as a small and powerful portable studio light.


Most pro LED photo and video lights are harsh and specular, unless diffused to within an inch of their life. Mighty. mini. uses Patent Pending LEDNatural technology to produce the smoothest, most natural LED lighting you have ever seen. The Mighty. mini. side-mounted LED lights are diffused multiple times before they light your subject. You won't get the typical squints, fake grins and hot spots that you get with conventional rear-mounted LED panels. In the case of the Mighty mini, soft luscious light does not equal low power. Mighty. mini. uses only high-grade Samsung daylight and tungsten balanced LED chips rated at over 50 lumens per LED. In fact, Mighty mini delivers almost as much power as a 300 watt incandescent bulb. These LED chips also have a high CRI (>=85) providing natural and vivid color rendition.



This is where you come in...
We are still a small 
family run company. We believe the Mighty. mini. is the best LED lighting product in its category, by 
far. Please continue to support the future of Photo and Video lighting as we grow stronger and better day by day.Your Impact & Our Future Plans
We think Mighty. mini. represents the future of photo & video lighting. By contributing you are making a difference in the lives of photographers and videographers everywhere. The Mighty. mini. project (along with our other projects) has the potential to totally up-end all our pre-conceived notions about what LED lighting can do, and where it can go. With the success of Mighty. mini. we plan to introduce additional products utilizing our LEDNatural technology.
We believe the Mighty. mini. is a key part of our 2nd wave of LED lighting strategy here at ColorRight. We can't wait to see where you take the Mighty. mini. or what you do with it once you get there.
We can't get there without you. Please help us get the word out, by telling your family and friends and through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. This site has convenient links for most social sites right here on this page.

<p><strong>ABOUT US &amp; OUR INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p>Three years ago we brought the Zuvo Water Filtration System to market because we knew there had to be a better alternative to expensive and environment-destroying bottled water. We knew that if we could provide a way for people to enjoy drinking their tap water again and trust it, then we could help people stay hydrated without having to rely on bottled water. Today we have three years of manufacturing experience under our belt and a community of customers and evangelists who love our product.</p>
<p>Now with Indiegogo, we want to launch a revolutionary ecosystem we call STRATUS. As a start-up company, creating breakthrough products and launching them in the marketplace used to be incredibly difficult. But now with the Indiegogo crowdfunding community a company like ours has the opportunity to bring disruptive technologies to the market.</p>
<p>By becoming a backer, your help will enable us to <span class=""notranslate"">put STRATUS into production, develop the largest database of water-quality information in the world and bring customized filter solutions into your home. </span></p>
<p><strong>STRATUS - A WATER ECOSYSTEM THAT TAKES WATER FILTRATION TO THE NEXT LEVEL</strong></p>
<p>Combining stunning faucet design, the Zuvo Water Filtration System, and a Cloud-connected app, STRATUS is the most intelligent water system that exists today. We're asking you to help us launch it by becoming an early invester and to make it possible for us to ultimately make it available to a much bigger market.</p>
<p>Here is a first look at STRATUS which includes: 1) the Zuvo Water Filtration System (countertop or under-counter setup), 2) a stunning Zuvo Beverage Faucet and 3) the Zuvo cloud-connected smartphone app. Together these three components comprise STRATUS which is at the nexus of the water ecosystem we're working to bring to market.</p>

Zuvo recreates nature's way of cleansing water. The ozone/UV combination is not only effective at killing bacteria; the two-pass setup also prevents bacterial film from growing on the filter and contaminating the water.

ABOUT US & OUR INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN
Three years ago we brought the Zuvo Water Filtration System to market because we knew there had to be a better alternative to expensive and environment-destroying bottled water. We knew that if we could provide a way for people to enjoy drinking their tap water again and trust it, then we could help people stay hydrated without having to rely on bottled water. Today we have three years of manufacturing experience under our belt and a community of customers and evangelists who love our product.
Now with Indiegogo, we want to launch a revolutionary ecosystem we call STRATUS. As a start-up company, creating breakthrough products and launching them in the marketplace used to be incredibly difficult. But now with the Indiegogo crowdfunding community a company like ours has the opportunity to bring disruptive technologies to the market.
By becoming a backer, your help will enable us to put STRATUS into production, develop the largest database of water-quality information in the world and bring customized filter solutions into your home. 
STRATUS - A WATER ECOSYSTEM THAT TAKES WATER FILTRATION TO THE NEXT LEVEL
Combining stunning faucet design, the Zuvo Water Filtration System, and a Cloud-connected app, STRATUS is the most intelligent water system that exists today. We're asking you to help us launch it by becoming an early invester and to make it possible for us to ultimately make it available to a much bigger market.
Here is a first look at STRATUS which includes: 1) the Zuvo Water Filtration System (countertop or under-counter setup), 2) a stunning Zuvo Beverage Faucet and 3) the Zuvo cloud-connected smartphone app. Together these three components comprise STRATUS which is at the nexus of the water ecosystem we're working to bring to market.

 
 

 

 
Stylish and Intelligent Faucets
Zuvo has been working for the last year with one of the leading Silicon Valley design firms, D2M, who also created the crowdfunding sensation Instacube. D2M designed and tested STRATUS and created a full range of innovatively designed and styled, intelligent faucets. Faucets will be available in Bamboo and Acacia tri-flow and Hibiscus beverage faucet styles in chrome, brushed nickel and oil-rubbed-bronze finishes.








Hibiscus Beverage Faucet Chrome 2.75""W x 4.5""D x 11""H
Bamboo Tri-Flow Faucet Brushed Nickel 2.5""W x 8.5""D x 15""H
Acacia Tri-Flow Faucet Brushed Nickel 5.5""W x 11.5""D x 18""H







Hibiscus Beverage Faucet Oil-Rubbed Bronze 2.75""W x 4.5""D x 11""H
Bamboo Tri-Flow Faucet Oil-Rubbed Bronze 2.5""W x 8.5""D x 15""H
Acacia Tri-Flow Faucet Oil-Rubbed Bronze 5.5""W x 11.5""D x 18""H



 
The intelligent, touch-sensing faucets not only turn on the filtered water but also show users the filter status with intuitive LED lights. Filter status is also provided on the Zuvo Water Filtration System availabile in either an under-counter or countertop set up. The end result is the world’s first intelligent, drinking water system right in your home.

Much More than a Carbon Filter
The Zuvo Water Filtration System is already is in production and independently tested to NSF/ANSI Standards 42, 53 and 55 Class B for Drinking Water Treatment Units by an accredited third-party laboratory. What makes it unique is that it goes beyond simple carbon filtration, by combining ultraviolet light (UV), ozone, and a carbon filter in a patented five-step process. Zuvo recreates nature's way of cleansing water. The ozone/UV combination is not only effective at killing bacteria; the two-pass setup also prevents bacterial film from growing on the filter and contaminating the water. It is the only filter system in the world that is self cleaning. Simple pitcher and faucet filters can't do this!
 
Water Information Via the Cloud 
The combination of Wi-Fi communication built into the Zuvo system and a Cloud-connected app deliver to your smartphone a host of important information about your water such as the remaining life of the filter, the reduction of contaminants in water based on local water quality, and the daily rate of water consumption in your household.

 
 

Water Quality Database & Hydration Coach App
Leveraging ease of access through your smartphone and the largest database of water quality information in the world, the STRATUS app provides real-time filter status, online filter purchases and important information about your local water. With the personalized, hydration coaching feature, you can precisely manage all of your daily water consumption requirements. By inputting age and weight, it will give you an approximate daily hydration target.
 
 
 
 
 
Customized Filters
Our filter product line today offers solutions for reducing a variety of water contaminants including chlorine, lead, cysts, particulates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). By leveraging the information available through the national water-quality database, we will greatly expand our filter solutions and offer customized filters to reduce contaminants that are common/prevalent in particular regions of the country.
 
No More Guessing When it's Time to Change Your Filter 
Check your filter status via your smartphone app and order replacement filters or sign up for a filter subscription with just a few clicks. The app tells you when your filter is good (blue), close to needing to be changed (yellow), or that it’s time to change your filter (red). Filter status is also displayed on the Zuvo system as well as on the STRATUS faucets.







Eco-Consciousness
Zuvo Water is 100% committed to reducing the global consumption of bottled water and raising consciousness about the value of water. The Stratus reduces the expense and waste of bottled water by not adding to the more than 50 billion plastic water bottles Americans used last year, 40 billion of which ended up in landfills. Additionally, STRATUS is designed according to sustainability principles. Non-painted and BPA-free plastics were chosen for durability, health considerations, and recyclability.

Short Summary
We are working from many years with renewable energy. Pay attention to the environmente trying to use better everything around us but always respecting the nature. Now we want to realize this special tables, even very particular for the design, but mostly more useful than a common one.  Making them with a photovoltaic solar panel those could become an renewable energy source for many electric devices of our homes, gardens, offices, bars and many other places which people are using always more and everywhere. 
   What We Need & What You Get

We have produced just some samples to get the patent for them and we need now funding to innovate and develop better this idea. It would be great if we can make more samples, using not only wood to make them but even other recyclable materials, for different locations and improve their utility. The purpose is to get more clean energy sources and less pollution!

  The Impact


Example:
Cell Phone or tablet: 8 Watt absorption for each charge
8 Watt x 365 days = 2.920 Watt (annual consumption of recharge)
0,5310 Kg of CO2 spared for each Kwh produced from renewable source
2.920 Watt : 0,53 Kg = spare of 1,54 Kg of CO2 in one year

Cell Phones in Italy = 73.200.000 (Eurostat 2007)
73.200.000 x 1,54 Kg/CO2 = 112.728,00 Tons of CO2
Emission from 1 car in one year = 2.940 Kg of CO2 (“Transport & Environment 2009” media of the models sold in Europe)
T. 112.728,00 : T. 2,94 = pollution of 38.342 cars in one year

<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello, my name is Greta Jourdane, I am 61 years old and a carer for my 89 year old mother who lives with me. I am a writer, author and artist. Together over the past 4 years, we have managed to pull together just on $30,000 towards a deposit for a house and we are needing another $12,000 for a descent deposit. I have approached the banks about a  home loan but can only obtain a 10-year loan due to my age ( 61 ) which would make the repayments very high without a hefty deposit. $12,000 is not a lot of money these days but it is difficult to obtain by saving a bit here and there out of what is left over after paying bills and we need some help please. We have come this far over a 4 year period. For us a home of our own would mean an end to having to rent places and having to move on all the time due to the owner's wanting to sell their investment properties. We can't keep doing this as we get older. There will come a day when we just won't be able to shift on at all.  Helping us over that line into home ownership would mean peace of mind for us in so many ways.

We wanted to do better.We totally reimagined how a weighted blanket looks, feels and is made. To preorder Nuzzie Knit at a steep discount to our future retail price, click Back This Project, or read on.   What's Wrong with Traditional Weighted Blankets?Not familiar with weighted blankets? We explain their benefits and the science behind them later on, but want to start with what we did to make Nuzzie Knit better than other weighted blankets. Traditional weighted blankets are:
Filled with glass beads which can shift around and even leak (no one likes cleaning thousands of glass beads out of their bed)
Not very breathable, trapping in excess body heat (sweaty nights, gross)
Not machine washable or machine dryable (what century is this?)
Not very stylish 
We set out to fix all these problems, and more...No More Pesky Glass BeadsNuzzie Knit ditches the glass beads for our patent pending high density fabric filling, DuraFill™. By using fabric to add weight to the blanket instead of beads, Nuzzie Knit is more comfortable and durable. Say Goodbye to Sleepless, Sweaty NightsOur open knit design allows air to circulate, for better temperature regulation—you'll stay cooler in the summer and warmer in the winterEasy CleaningTraditional weighted blankets need to be hand washed to prevent them from fraying, ripping and leaking. Nuzzie Knit's beadless design and durable fabrics allows you to just throw it in the washer or dryer—worry free.Benefits of Weighted BlanketsSay goodbye to tossing, turning and counting sheep. Nuzzie Knit will help you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer and wake up feeling refreshed.Like other weighted blankets, Nuzzie Knit applies gentle weight to pressure points around your body making you feel instantly calm, grounded and stress-free...just like a swaddled baby. (It’s the same science!)
Can a Weighted Blanket Help You? On a scale of 1 to 10, how well did you sleep last night?We hope it’s a 10...but if you’re anything like the average adult, you’re not getting enough sleep. Restful and restorative sleep is crucial for your body to operate at peak performance throughout the day. In fact, the CDC declared sleep disorders a “public health epidemic”That’s right, a public health epidemic. Getting enough sleep is a big deal.→ The good news: Weighted blankets have been scientifically shown to improve your sleep quality. The gentle weight targets pressure points around your body, in a process called DPS or ""Deep Pressure Stimulation"". DPS activates the central nervous system, modulating its hormone production in beneficial ways. Specifically, it boosts serotonin (happy hormone) and melatonin (sleepiness), while reducing cortisol (stress).Happy + Sleepy - Stress, completely natural and drug free! Now that's amazing. → The great news: The Nuzzie Knit can be of value to anyone in the following groups:
Anyone looking to improve their sleep quality 
People who have trouble falling asleep 
Remote workers who want to focus and destress during their work day
Adults and children with ADHD, anxiety, autism, restless leg syndrome, insomnia, and PTSD 

Product Details SpecsPlease see the FAQ for a discussion on choosing the best weight.  We have 3 size choices: Child, Queen, and King. The child size comes in 8lbs, the Queen in 15lbs and 20lbs, and the King in 25lbs. The fabric material is made of our proprietary patent pending DuraFill™ which is a high density fiber that is long-lasting and ultra durable. Care InstructionsMachine wash warm, tumble dry low.ColorsWe know, we know... we all love colors! The more the merrier and that's why we have 3 to choose from! You will be able to choose your color after the campaign is complete. We will be sending out a survey to all our backers which will allow you to choose your color.We're No NewbiesWith over three years of experience designing and making weighted blankets, we're confident that we can deliver. With hundreds of five-star reviews on our traditional weighted blankets, you can trust that we have the manufacturing capability and the customer service experience to make sure that you love your Nuzzie Knit purchase.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>     Greetings! My name is Kara Macro and I am an Assistant Innkeeper and have been for the past seven years on beautiful Cape Cod in Massachusetts. I currently work at the Beechwood Inn located in Historic Barnstable Village, MA. The Beechwood Inn is for sale and my husband, Frank and I would like to purchase this property. We have been planning and saving for many years to buy a business on Cape Cod. We have both lived here for 20+ years.  The prices are right for buying and we are ready BUT it appears the financial world is a bit broken right now.  We have the down payment covered and plenty of money to start off with but the lending world does not agree and would like us to secure MORE money in order to back us on purchasing this business. As honest and hard working Cape Cod residents, we could not just ask people for money because we want a business. We would like to offer you a great deal on a room in exchange for your financial support and patience while we purchase the Beechwood Inn. We would like you to consider relaxing on Cape Cod!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     What we need is to satisfy the requirement of the lender of having 25% of the purchase price in the bank at the time of purchase, in CASH. We have some of the money but need to raise $100,000- $120,000 more. The monies raised from this campaign will go solely towards the operation of the Inn itself after the purchase is complete.</p>
<p>     We could think of no better way to get the money we need other than to offer people an exceptional deal on a room at the Beechwood Inn on Cape Cod!! All of the perks to the right are about a 40% discount off the current prices at this Inn and others on Cape Cod! We hope this discount will allow many people who have been unable to afford a trip to the Cape in the past couple of years a chance to visit also. Everyone will get a box of Famous Cape Cod Saltwater Taffy and a Postcard of thanks from us! PLUS- whichever perk you are entitled too under the amount of support you are willing to lend.</p>
<p><br/>Here is what you can expect to happen...</p>
<p>-Pledge your money and pick your perk</p>
<p>-At the end of this campaign (December) when our goal has been met, we will start the process of purchasing the Beechwood Inn. We expect this to take 30-90 days before we are official owners.</p>
<p>-Once we are officially owners(by March of 2013)- we will contact you and offer to redeem your stay! If you are not ready to visit Cape Cod - we will mail you a Gift Certificate detailing your perk/stay. You may keep this until you are ready to use OR you may gift it to someone else to use!</p>
<p>-THE ONLY RESTRICTION- We will have no restrictions or certain times or days you must stay- as Inn and Motels on Cape Cod often do- you may redeem your perk in the Summer or weekend or whenever you would like. The only restriction we must enforce is that we do not allow children under 12 years of age at the Inn. We are willing, however to deal with this on a case by case basis. If you have children and are interested in supporting us- please do not hesitate to ask!</p>

<p>*** IMPORTANT: We want you to know that there is every possibility that someone could purchase the Beechwood Inn before we are able too. We do have a back up plan!! There are currently 5 other Inn's (same price) with similar amenities for sale on Cape Cod and all within a short distance from this Inn. This campaign is about YOU getting to relax on Cape Cod and US buying an Inn. We want you to feel secure about supporting us. We didn't just drive by an Inn and decide it might be fun- this has been my very satisfying career for the past seven years and my husband is a Restaurant General Manager- we enjoy serving people and helping them to enjoy Cape Cod. No matter what happens- we aim to own an Inn and give you a great place to relax on Cape Cod! Should we be unable to purchase an Inn by March 2013- we would happily REFUND all monies back to you! ****</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>    How does your support of us buying an Inn help? Cape Cod is a seashore community made up of about one dozen towns. The cost of living is very high here and the pay rates are lower than the rest of our state. Year round residents are being eaten alive by this bad economy. Many residents have moved off of Cape Cod and out of State- others have moved in with each other in one home. For each year round resident lost to this bad economy- there is not a new resident to replace them. Instead, we have a bunch of people buying properties (especially historic) for private use for vacation purposes and only using them for two weeks out of the year. These grand historic properties are no longer available to the public or local residents, as they should be. Consider your support of us buying an Inn as a step in saving the year round population of Cape Cod and allowing one of our grand historic properties to stay in the right hands and be open to the public for all to enjoy! Cape Cod's history is where America's history began!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>     No money? No problem! What we could use most of all is help in getting these great deals for a stay on Cape Cod to the people who will use them!</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE pass this campaign to anyone you know who loves Cape Cod or travels! The great deals speak for themselves! </strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h2>One smartphone, 128 cameras </h2>
<p>Connecting and controlling multiple cameras to shoot one object from different angles is a key and original innovation of CamBuddy Pro. </p>
<p>Simply, you can setup the cameras connected in <b>synchronized mode</b>, and every camera works under the same trigger function (e.g., sound trigger, lightning trigger or radio trigger). When there is a sound, lightning, or radio signal, all cameras will capture pictures at the same time from different angles. By using Joopic app, you only need to setup one CamBuddy Pro's work mode, others will follow up. Under synchronized mode, you can even setup every camera in the array has an equidifferent delay time.</p>
<p>CamBuddy Pro provides the ability to connect to up 128 cameras to capture stunning Matrix bullet-time footage,  as demonstrated in the video.</p>

FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS

Long-range full control with live view 
The long operating range (up to 100 feet) of CamBuddy Pro allows you to capture the wildest creatures' close-up from a safe distance. You have a real-time view of the image and can adjust the exposure time, aperture, ISO, exposure compensation, shooting delay, and other parameters any time on your smartphone. The app also allows you to auto-focus by tapping anywhere of the image or fine tune with manual-focus.

 
Time-lapse photography    
Through CamBuddy Pro’s intervalometer function you can create time-lapse photography on you smartphone easily. You can set the number of shots, interval, and delay time; Moreover, you can quickly play back the pictures by using our app and create a time-lapse video.

High-speed photography
CamBuddy Pro is equipped with four sensors - sound, lightning, laser, and radio, as well as a built-in radio transmitter. Combined, it unlocks many creative photography modes including sound/light/laser/radio activated shutter or flash, or use sound/light/laser/Joopic app to activate the built-in radio transmitter to set other cameras to go off. You can capture high-speed motion scenes and fleeting moments, creating amazing pictures with ease. 
Sound-triggered shooting
Set the trigger to go off at a desired sound level. Capture the clinking of glasses or activate the camera by hand clapping.
Sound triggered shooting
Lightning-triggered shooting
Set the trigger to go off when lightning strikes. You can also synchronize multiple CamBuddy Pros with a flash to shoot an object from different angles simultaneously. 
Lightning triggered shooting
Laser-triggered shooting
Set your camera to go off when something breaking a laser beam aimed at CamBuddy Pro. Capture the transient object or wildlife in action. A CamBuddy-specific laser generator is included in the laser bundle. 
Laser triggered shooting
Radio-triggered shooting
Set your camera to go off by radio-waves. Radio trigger is immune to harsh environmental conditions and can be used to set off multiple CamBuddy Pros synchronously. CamBuddy Pro has a built-in radio transmitter that can be activated from the app, or by light, sound, and laser. You can also get a handheld CamBuddy-specific radio transmitter by supporting the ""radio bundle"". 
Ultimate selfie from 100 feet away 

 
No need to challenge your arm's strength. Take a selfie from 100 feet away with an easy smile and a simple click. @Ben Stiller could retire his world record long selfie stick of just 28 ft.

 
Shoot-and-push
Photos taken are automatically pushed to your smartphone through the Shoot-and-Push function. You can also edit, manage, and share the pictures on social media.

 
One smartphone, 128 cameras 
Connecting and controlling multiple cameras to shoot one object from different angles is a key and original innovation of CamBuddy Pro. 
Simply, you can setup the cameras connected in synchronized mode, and every camera works under the same trigger function (e.g., sound trigger, lightning trigger or radio trigger). When there is a sound, lightning, or radio signal, all cameras will capture pictures at the same time from different angles. By using Joopic app, you only need to setup one CamBuddy Pro's work mode, others will follow up. Under synchronized mode, you can even setup every camera in the array has an equidifferent delay time.
CamBuddy Pro provides the ability to connect to up 128 cameras to capture stunning Matrix bullet-time footage,  as demonstrated in the video.
When you are in a wedding ceremony, you may want to use two or more cameras to shoot bride and groom from different angels. For this situation, we can setup the cameras to work in master-slave mode. You can hold the master camera and capture the close range scene. Meanwhile, the slave cameras, which are fixed in other positions and controlled by CamBuddy Pros, can be triggered by a lightning from your external flash or a radio wave from a handheld radio transmitter.  
This scenario can also be used to monitor your home or office. You can set the master CamBuddy Pro to work under laser trigger mode. When someone break the laser, the CamBuddy Pro can be triggered to send a radio wave, which then trigger other cameras to take a picture or start to record a video.
Control multiple cameras simultaneously through WiFi-connection

You can use CamBuddy Pro to browse and transfer the pictures and the videos taken by the camera to your smartphone instantly without copying the files to your desktop computer first.
 
 
If you are still wonder whether your camera are supported by CamBuddy Pro, please send a message to @creator or leave a message as a comment. We will answer your question as soon as possible.

The diagrams below illustrate the ports and the cables used to connect a CamBuddy Pro with a camera or other devices.


A) You can use the micro USB cable included in the product package to charge CamBuddy Pro. Note that the cable is for charging only, not a USB data cable. 
B) You can use the USB data cable shipped with your camera to connect CamBuddy Pro to your camera's USB port. If you want to use live view or remote shoot, or transfer pictures from your camera, you use this port.
C) You can use a shutter release cable to connect to your camera's shutter release port. When you use the intervalometer or the smart trigger functions, you can choose this port to release the camera's shutter. 
D) You can use a standard 3.5mm PC flash cable to connect to an external flash. When you use the intervalometer or the smart trigger functions, you can choose the port to trigger the external flash.

WHAT ARE THE PERKS?



CamBuddy Pro (Silver): Get one CamBuddy Pro (with silver alloy cover) for a discount of up to 32%. Please note a shutter release cable or a flash cable is required for high speed photography and different models of your camera might require different cable. If you don't already have one for your camera, we suggest you to purchase it from adorama http://bit.ly/2ddPALz, or other online store.

CamBuddy Pro (Black): Get one CamBuddy Pro (with black alloy cover) for a discount of up to 30%. Please note that the dark alloy cover gives you a cool appearance and of course the manufacturing process is more complex than the silver alloy cover. The picture below shows the differences between them.



Get It All: One CamBuddy Pro (with black alloy cover) + one handheld radio transmitter + one laser generator + one cable set. 

Radio trigger is best immune to the environmental factors. CamBuddy Pro has a built-in radio transceiver. You can use one CamBuddy Pro's radio transmitter to trigger another one's radio receiver. The handheld radio transmitter here provide a way to trigger a CamBuddy Pro or multiple CamBuddy Pros manually. 
You can use a general laser pointer to trigger CamBuddy Pro, but CamBuddy Pro's built-in laser sensor works best with the laser generator designed specific for CamBuddy Pro. Note that in the package of the laser generator, a portable power bank is also included.
In the cable set, there are 4 different types of shutter release cables and 1 flash cable. The shutter release cables in the set cover all fully supported DSLR cameras listed above. The flash cable is a standard 3.5mm-PC flash cable, which is suitable for most external flashes. 



Matrix Pack. Get six units (all with silver alloy covers) and unlock the Matrix bullet-time mode. A handheld radio transmitter, a laser generator, and six cable sets are included in the bundle.
 
ABOUT US

Our Story
We’ve come a long way to make the best and only all-in-one camera remote. We believed innovative picture taking could be more fun, and photos could be shared more easily and instantly. With these beliefs in mind, our team spent countless nights designing, programming, and prototyping to bring CamBuddy Pro to life. Credits also go to volunteers around the world who helped us during beta testing, making CamBuddy Pro perfect. 
The enthusiasm from the community convinced us CamBuddy Pro will be a big success. We already made the investment on all production equipment needed and your support will allow us to start now. 
Our Team - Engineers 
Our operation in Houston, TX is supported by an amazing engineering team based in Beijing, China. Our engineers have the strongest background and every expertise in hardware design, coding, and manufacturing. We have gone through numerous rounds of prototyping and now present to you the CamBuddy Pro that we are proud of. 

 
Our Team - Beta Testers
We are a small team supported by a big community of photographers. We knew we couldn't build the best product without listening to you. Special thanks go to @Julie Everhart who volunteered to offer us tremendous insights to make CamBuddy Pro more powerful and intuitive to use. We are honored to have her as CamBuddy's first ambassador. Check out her posts about what she can do with CamBuddy:

We are scheduled to wed in Las Vegas, NV on July 29th 2013. Mike and I are the biggest nerds you will find, enjoying every opportunity to geek out, and our wedding is no exception. Growing up, I always joked about having a Star Trek wedding in vegas with my grandma. When she passed away almost 2 years ago, so I made it my goal to keep my word.</p>
<p>Mike proposed to me on Thanksgiving this last november, and I couldnt say yes fast enough. he has been my super hero for over 3 years. I love him dearly and knew he was my Superman.</p>
<p>If only the world was complete, we would ride off into the sunset on lovely new hover boards... I was laid off a year ago, and just began working a little more than a month ago. I have been working as hard as I can making home made geek crafts and selling them at shows, but that money doesnt go as far as we need it to. Mike works very hard, but hours at work fluctuate alot, and during the school symester 4 days a week working on his second degree for film production.</p>
<p>We have been lucky to order my Star Trek dress and Mike's Colonial Marine Uniform, as well as a little Mini Star fleet dress for my little one. We are now focusing on Airline Tickets, and hotel Accomadations, final touches, and regular vacation budgeting.</p>
<p>We are doing this wedding without turning to ANY family for financial assistance. Instead I am hoping to work for the additional money. Even though I returned to the work force, I still run an online store, and I hope you can visit my shop! <a href=""sillyrabbitcrafts.etsy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sillyrabbitcrafts.etsy.com</a></p>
<p>I have also set up Contribution Perks on here as well. (All donation perks will be sent out by July 10th, any shop orders will be shipped out as fast as they can be filled)</p>
<p>With the donations from Indiegogo, it will go towards hotel stay, the rest of the wedding fee, food and activities for the newly wed couple and my Daughter. Anything you can contribute(or any orders through the my online store) will be so greatly appreciated. (Donations for $5 perk for Lani: Lani will receive full amount up to $5, the remaining goes towards any further expenses)</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Dewa Bleisinger and I´m a product designer from Berlin, Germany. By backing this product you´ll help me get it into production.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">A short summary for my German-speaking followers:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #727272;""><em>Diese Kampagne dient dazu, Vorbestellungen für mein Produkt QUAD entgegenzunehmen, um einen Teil der Produktionskosten vorab decken zu können. Dadurch ermöglicht ihr mir, <span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><em>mein Produkt</em></span> unabhängig von etablierten Herstellern nach meinen Vorstellungen von nachhaltiger und fairer Produktion umzusetzen. Die Preise können nur in einer Währung angegeben werden, daher steht hier alles in US Dollar. Wenn ihr Fragen zum Produkt oder zur Produktion habt, könnt ihr mich gerne anschreiben oder sie im Kommentarbereich hinterlassen. Ich freue mich schon darauf, dieses tolle Produkt endlich umsetzen zu können!</em> <br/></span></p>
<p>QUAD is not just a trivet. It´s a beautiful and exciting design object. Its practical, but not just reduced to its function. It´s captivating, inspiring and will put a smile on your lips.</p>
<p>I have been working on this product for the last few months finalizing the materials, details, manufacturers, packaging. I`ve even produced a small hand-made batch which I sent out to my family, friends and retailers....and they love it!</p>
<p>Now I´m ready to get it produced in a larger scale so more people can enjoy this wonderful product.</p>
<p>This product will be made using local wood from Germany with the help of local manufacturers as well as my own studio in order to provide high quality and sustainability.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><strong>The QUAD Trivet</strong></span></h2>
<p>QUAD consists of 16 wooden cubes – oiled walnut or maple - connected by a silicone ribbon inserted in the underside of the cubes. The silicone ribbon is flexible, yet durable and heat-resistant. This structures allows various configurations ranging from a compact square to a widespread circular shape.</p>
<p>There are multitudinous variations ranging from basic geometries to more chaotic and decorative shapes.</p>
<p>materials: walnut or maple wood from Germany (oiled), silicone ribbon, felt pads<br/> dimensions: 12 x 12 x 3cm (basic square) unfolds up to Ø 25 x 3cm (circular)</p>

<p>In a world of mass products and big retail chains, trying to establish a label for useful and innovative design products is challenging.</p>
<p>I have had a lot of positive response so far and realized in order to make my work sustainable I need to reach the end customers, the design enthusiasts, people who are looking for individual and innovative products - and not necessarily the big retailers.</p>
<p>By pre-ordering the QUAD trivet you are backing the first production run and helping establish my brand as a maker of innovative and exciting design products.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">The QUAD Trivet is a simple product, which keeps the manufacturing clear and manageable. However, it isn´t so easy to manufacture it in higher quantities and offer it for an affordable price. Until now I can only buy small quantites of wood and do each step by hand. To offer this product for a more affordable price I need to invest in larger quantites of wood and outsource some of the manufacturing steps. The main supplier and manufacturer will be my trusted local wood workshop in Germany, which supplied the wood for the first prototypes. The final manufacturing steps and packaging will be done in my studio in Berlin, Germany. </span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">I have tried to design this product as sustainable as possible using <span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">mainly</span> </span>natural materials such as wood and felt from local production. Also, I use solvent-free linseed oil for the wood coating and solvent-free adhesives. The flexible silicone ribbon is durable, long-lasting and heat-resistant.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"">After the campaign ends I will immediately go into production. Since this product is also producible in small quantities I can ensure each backer will recieve his backing order even if the backing goal is not reached. As a professional product designer a high quality of execution is my top priority. 4-6 weeks after the campaign ends the first shipment of QUADs will be sent out.</span></p>

Hi, my name is Dewa Bleisinger and I´m a product designer from Berlin, Germany. By backing this product you´ll help me get it into production.
A short summary for my German-speaking followers:
Diese Kampagne dient dazu, Vorbestellungen für mein Produkt QUAD entgegenzunehmen, um einen Teil der Produktionskosten vorab decken zu können. Dadurch ermöglicht ihr mir, mein Produkt unabhängig von etablierten Herstellern nach meinen Vorstellungen von nachhaltiger und fairer Produktion umzusetzen. Die Preise können nur in einer Währung angegeben werden, daher steht hier alles in US Dollar. Wenn ihr Fragen zum Produkt oder zur Produktion habt, könnt ihr mich gerne anschreiben oder sie im Kommentarbereich hinterlassen. Ich freue mich schon darauf, dieses tolle Produkt endlich umsetzen zu können! 
QUAD is not just a trivet. It´s a beautiful and exciting design object. Its practical, but not just reduced to its function. It´s captivating, inspiring and will put a smile on your lips.
I have been working on this product for the last few months finalizing the materials, details, manufacturers, packaging. I`ve even produced a small hand-made batch which I sent out to my family, friends and retailers....and they love it!
Now I´m ready to get it produced in a larger scale so more people can enjoy this wonderful product.
This product will be made using local wood from Germany with the help of local manufacturers as well as my own studio in order to provide high quality and sustainability.
 
What is the QUAD good for?

 

 

 
QUAD unfolds from a 12 x 12cm (4.72″ x 4.72″ ) square up to a Ø 25cm (9.84″ ) circle...

 
Discover the seemingly endless array of patterns you can create

 
The QUAD Trivet
QUAD consists of 16 wooden cubes – oiled walnut or maple - connected by a silicone ribbon inserted in the underside of the cubes. The silicone ribbon is flexible, yet durable and heat-resistant. This structures allows various configurations ranging from a compact square to a widespread circular shape.
There are multitudinous variations ranging from basic geometries to more chaotic and decorative shapes.
materials: walnut or maple wood from Germany (oiled), silicone ribbon, felt pads dimensions: 12 x 12 x 3cm (basic square) unfolds up to Ø 25 x 3cm (circular)
 

 
DEWADESIGN
In a world of mass products and big retail chains, trying to establish a label for useful and innovative design products is challenging.
I have had a lot of positive response so far and realized in order to make my work sustainable I need to reach the end customers, the design enthusiasts, people who are looking for individual and innovative products - and not necessarily the big retailers.
By pre-ordering the QUAD trivet you are backing the first production run and helping establish my brand as a maker of innovative and exciting design products.
 

 
 
 
Felt pads on the underside of the cubes protect table surfaces from being scratched

 
 
Will be available in oiled walnut and maple wood

 


 


Production + Shipping
The QUAD Trivet is a simple product, which keeps the manufacturing clear and manageable. However, it isn´t so easy to manufacture it in higher quantities and offer it for an affordable price. Until now I can only buy small quantites of wood and do each step by hand. To offer this product for a more affordable price I need to invest in larger quantites of wood and outsource some of the manufacturing steps. The main supplier and manufacturer will be my trusted local wood workshop in Germany, which supplied the wood for the first prototypes. The final manufacturing steps and packaging will be done in my studio in Berlin, Germany. 
I have tried to design this product as sustainable as possible using mainly natural materials such as wood and felt from local production. Also, I use solvent-free linseed oil for the wood coating and solvent-free adhesives. The flexible silicone ribbon is durable, long-lasting and heat-resistant.
After the campaign ends I will immediately go into production. Since this product is also producible in small quantities I can ensure each backer will recieve his backing order even if the backing goal is not reached. As a professional product designer a high quality of execution is my top priority. 4-6 weeks after the campaign ends the first shipment of QUADs will be sent out.
 


Perks
Perks are a pre-order of the QUAD Trivet or of other dewadesign goodies which will fund the production run of QUAD. Please note that shipping costs must be added to the Perk prices and that I am shipping from Germany.
Perks sind Vorbestellungen des QUADs, um die Produktion zu finanzieren. Nach Ablauf der Kampagne wird das Produkt - also der Perk - hergestellt und an euch verschickt.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>We are blessed with the wonderful mission of helping to find homes for orphaned children - especially those children who are determined to have ""special needs.""  We help lower and middle income US adopting families who are opening their hearts and homes to these wonderful children.  These wonderful families have a significantly increased financial burden due to the cost of the child's associated medical or psychological treatments. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>What we Need From You</strong></p>
<p>Please consider contributing at one of the levels shown to the right, so that we can achieve our goal of finding loving families for 100 orphans by Christmas.  We issue grants in $500 multiples, so you can see we still need your help! </p>

<div> </div>
<div>But before you decide if you want to help us, we think you should hear the stories behind the first 3 grants we gave out in 2007.  <br/><p><strong>The First Three Adoption Grant from The Orphan Foundation</strong></p>
<p>What makes a single mom struggling to start up a new business, adopt a hard-to-place, “special needs” child from another country? Why would a perfectly happy, healthy, and content family take on a Down syndrome child with heart complications, when the boy’s own mother chose to give him up at 6 weeks of age? And why would a New York family rescue three frail and traumatized orphans from the ravages of Liberia’s second civil war?</p>
<p>We asked ourselves these questions as our foundation’s Board reviewed the grant requests from these families. When most people hear the term ‘adoption,’ we tend to think about couples faced with infertility, or couples who are trying to put their step-families together to strengthen their family bond. These first three grant requests to The Orphan Foundation bore no similarities to those stereotypical images.</p>
<p><strong>The Smith Case – California</strong></p>
<p>Madeleine Smith, the first recipient of an adoption assistance grant from our Foundation, is a very interesting woman. She describes herself as having a big heart, with an even bigger pile of bills. When she found her way to our Foundation, she was in the process of adopting Dang Jian, a “special needs” child from China. The name she chose for the 4-year old boy is “Elijah.” She describes Elijah as a wonderful child who loves to play outside, and is especially fond of toy cars. His fifth birthday will be in December, so she’s planning a very big celebration when he arrives.</p>
<p>But that is only a small piece of the story. Dang Jian was placed in the “special needs” category by his China orphanage, and given to an adoption agency in Oregon to place. Dang Jian is missing his right ear, which is accompanied by marginal hearing on that side. Adding to that malady are various urinogenital and colorectal problems. These factors, along with his age, also put him in the “hard-to-place” category of adoptions. And what does that mean? He was given this one last chance to be adopted before he would be permanently institutionalized in China.</p>
<p>If China and the adoption world considered Elijah’s problems as significantly daunting, why would a single mom struggling to grow a start-up music services business, step in to rescue him? Good question. But wait.  There is still another page to this story.</p>
<p>Elijah will be Madeleine’s third “special needs” child that she has adopted! And she also has a 22-year old college student son, Donovan. Madeleine’s other adopted children include her 7-year old son Michael, from Bulgaria, and her 3-year old daughter Hana, from Guatemala. And just to make this random act of love more difficult on her, Madeleine decided she had to move from her 2-bedroom apartment to a 3-bedroom apartment to make sure that there was enough room for Elijah in his new home.</p>
<p>Madeleine discovered Dang Jian, when a friend emailed her that she saw Dang Jian’s story on an adoption agency’s website, and described his impending fate. Madeleine found out that someone had put up an anonymous donation to help offset part of the adoption expenses, and that started Madeleine’s wheels in motion. With domestic adoptions averaging $18,105 currently, and almost double that internationally, due to travel costs, document translations and other country specific requirements, this was the opening break she needed. This was her chance to give Elijah a home, and she’d worry about the rest of his living and medical needs when he was in her care.</p>
<p>Madeleine has since arranged for the UCLA Craniofacial Center to replace Elijah’s missing ear. All she wanted from The Orphan Foundation was enough money to finish her legal paperwork with the State of California, get the legal documents translated into Chinese and certified, and have enough left over to pay her travel expenses to China to bring “Elijah” home.</p>
<p>When we asked her why she was doing this, she simply repeated what she said earlier – she has a big heart. The only anchor on that big heart seems to be that big pile of bills she’s managed to build in the process. Our Board could not have agreed more, and voted unanimously to grant her the money.</p>
<p><strong>The Cancilla Case – California</strong></p>
<p>Mary and Warren Cancilla, along with daughter Annalise, seemed truly overjoyed about 6-week old Harrison’s arrival. Harrison would be that new brother for Annalise, and the perfect one boy, one girl family would arrive in a small, quiet California town. However, this family portrait turns out to be a bit more unique than that. Harrison was born with Down syndrome, with the added rare heart complication called tetralogy of Fallot.</p>
<p>Mary, a sign language interpreter, told us that they had been on the Down Syndrome Association of Greater Cincinnati’s waiting list for 2 years. This seemed hardly a “spur of the moment” decision. When the association called to tell the Cancilla’s that Harrison’s mother decided to give him up, and they were on the top of the list to receive a Downs syndrome child, they were overjoyed that their long wait was finally over.</p>
<p>What did they want from The Orphan Foundation? Just some financial help with their adoption costs so that they could free up some money for the medical needs that Harrison will be facing.</p>
<p>Another unanimous vote, and another unnoticed random act of love from just a regular kind of family who chose to love a very special boy.</p>
<p><strong>The Buckley Case – New York</strong></p>
<p>When we talked with Lorraine Buckley she told us all about the incidents that led up to their finding Abrous, the brother of one of the two girls that they had already adopted from an orphanage in Liberia – an orphanage that had been overrun by soldiers during Liberia’s deadly civil wars. A badly beaten orphanage director managed to save the children from harm, by convincing the soldiers that some of the children might be their own. The soldiers confiscated all of the orphans’ food, but allowed the children to vacate the orphanage. The children walked for two days in search of shelter, with at most, a handful of rice for each day of their journey. The UN came to their rescue, and stepped in to provide them with blankets and food. Eventually the orphanage reopened, but everything was completely destroyed, including the children’s beds and toys.</p>
<p>Now what was the connection and motivation that moved the Buckley’s to adopt these two young girls in the first place? Lorraine’s dad was doing some volunteer work to build a home for an old Air Force buddy, who had later turned to missionary work. While swapping time with other contractors to save his buddy money, Lorraine’s father met yet another missionary family in the area. That family had already adopted one of the children from that Liberian orphanage, by the name of George. George had been spared from the attack on the orphanage by being in the US on tour with the Liberian Boy’s Choir. It took a year for George to get up enough courage to ask the missionary family to try to find his sister, who was also living in that orphanage. The family was in shock. They never even knew he had a sister! The family agreed immediately, found his sister Mala, and brought her to the States.</p>
<p>When the Buckley’s went to visit Lorraine’s parents during the December holidays of 2004, they also met the other missionary family, and the reunited siblings, George and Mala. The plight of these children thrust them into motion. Mala asked the Buckley’s if they would help find her two roommates from the orphanage, Patience and Naomi. The Buckley’s not only found them, but by October 2005, the girls were on their way here to their new home with the Buckley’s in New York.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, when Lorraine’s father and husband went to pick-up the girls, Naomi's parents brought her brother Abrous to the Liberian orphanage when they came to see Naomi off. Abrous’ parents asked that the Buckley’s take Abrous as well as his sister Naomi. It wasn’t safe for any of them in Liberia, and the parents were not only living in abject poverty, their situation was made even worse by Abrous’ father being severely injured in a work accident. But in that first round of adoptions, the Buckley’s only succeeded in bringing the 7 and 9 year old girls back to New York. Abrous had already been relinquished to the orphanage, but he was on a waiting list to get in, and of course there was the mound of official paperwork required, and all the money that had yet to be raised. Imagine that - on a waiting list to get into an orphanage!</p>
<p>When they brought the two girls home to New York, Abrous returned home with his parents to wait for an opening at the orphanage. Luck finally prevailed, and at the end of August, Abrous was one of 100-plus children admitted to the orphanage. The Buckley family immediately went into motion trying to raise the money they needed to rescue Abrous, and once again, they reentered the adoption process. Nearly 14 months later, in December of 2006, their documents were finally clear to send to Liberia, and the monies were almost all in place to cover the country fees and other adoption costs. As of July 2007, they are still waiting for word on the case, and final passport clearance. The Buckley’s are hoping that the adoption petition is either in the Liberian courts or will be there very soon.</p>
<p>What did they want from The Orphan Foundation? Financial help to complete the adoption. The families were all asked to go through the same United States adoption agency, which resulted in additional processing fees of $1,800. The Buckley’s were now running out of sources to tap for quick financial help, and were becoming more anxious and desperate in the eleventh hour of Abrous’ rescue. Another unanimous vote from the Board, and another lost child in the world was sent a lifeline.</p>
<p>These were definitely not the stories that we expected to see in our first three grant requests. Where was that stereotypical family that was starving for a child of their own, but left barren by some cruel twist of biological fate? Where was that known connection between the parties that used adoption to solidify a new marriage and family? These weren’t childless parents looking to fill an empty space in their heart, or stepparents coming in to secure the bonds of their new family. These were a whole new breed of parents, with a whole new agenda and view of life.</p>
<p>Our 12-person Board looked at each other in astonishment. We just couldn’t get our heads around this left-turn in our world views. We were seeing entirely different passions at play, complete with an unfaltering commitment to see the long arduous adoption process through to the end, so that they could then begin on the really hard part of all this – raising children with some very special needs.</p>
<p>We told all three of these families that they are the real heroes out there. Forget Superwoman, Batman, and Spiderman. Meet Madeleine, the Cancilla’s, and the Buckley’s. These are the kind of quiet heroes we pass on the streets each day, and had no clue that they even existed. They’re made of the same mettle as those courageous people, who rush into burning buildings to save children, rescue a fallen soldier from enemy fire, or run down a thief who snatched an old woman’s purse. And then they want to quietly disappear behind their private lives, shying away from the cameras and lights of a press eager to exploit their bravery and courage. These families don’t even seem to know what all the fuss is about. Wouldn’t all of us do the same?</p>
<p>Perhaps it was that small quote, nearly hidden at the top of our home page that led them to us:</p>
<p>""We ask that you not judge our success in terms of ""bottom lines."" Instead, we ask to be measured by the number of ""lifelines"" we extend to the homeless children of this world.""</p>
<p>Perhaps we were never alone in our mission to find these children a family to love them, to cherish their worth, and to give them hope. Either way, bear witness to the birth of a whole new breed of family. Meet the new “tutelaries of hope,” the real guardians of our world’s children. They know no bigotry, no deception, nor bias of thought that would ever prevent them from the simple act of loving a child that would otherwise be lost to the world. We think this is a bright and shining light in the distant skies, and we choose to call that light “hope ascending.”</p>

<p> </p></div>","Our Mission
We are blessed with the wonderful mission of helping to find homes for orphaned children - especially those children who are determined to have ""special needs.""  We help lower and middle income US adopting families who are opening their hearts and homes to these wonderful children.  These wonderful families have a significantly increased financial burden due to the cost of the child's associated medical or psychological treatments. 
What we Need From You
Please consider contributing at one of the levels shown to the right, so that we can achieve our goal of finding loving families for 100 orphans by Christmas.  We issue grants in $500 multiples, so you can see we still need your help! 
If you'd like more information, you can continue reading below, or visit our website at www.TheOrphanFoundation.org.
Sometimes Statistics Speak Volumes:

There are 143,000,000 orphans in the world
There are an additional 20,000,000 “displaced children” in the world

The combined count of these categories makes the orphan population the 7th largest nation on the planet – slightly larger than the population of Russia
In some Middle Eastern countries, unwanted children with Downs Syndrome are used for terrorist acts of bombing.
In Africa, homeless children are armed and used for war.
In Africa, there is a concerted effort to extend children’s lives beyond 5 years of age
In Eastern Europe, less than 50% of the orphan population will live to see their 20th birthdays
In Eastern Europe, of the orphans that survive their 20th birthdays, 50% will end up in organized crime, drugs, or prostitution
In the US, 25% of foster children become homeless
30,000 leave the system every year without getting into a family
56% of foster care children enter the unemployment ranks
27% of the emancipated male children in foster care end up in jail
30% of the emancipated females in foster care experience early parenthood


Here are some of the adoption agencies / non-profits through which we gave grants to these adopting families.  We give monies only through 501(c)3 intermediaries.  :

But before you decide if you want to help us, we think you should hear the stories behind the first 3 grants we gave out in 2007.  The First Three Adoption Grant from The Orphan Foundation
What makes a single mom struggling to start up a new business, adopt a hard-to-place, “special needs” child from another country? Why would a perfectly happy, healthy, and content family take on a Down syndrome child with heart complications, when the boy’s own mother chose to give him up at 6 weeks of age? And why would a New York family rescue three frail and traumatized orphans from the ravages of Liberia’s second civil war?
We asked ourselves these questions as our foundation’s Board reviewed the grant requests from these families. When most people hear the term ‘adoption,’ we tend to think about couples faced with infertility, or couples who are trying to put their step-families together to strengthen their family bond. These first three grant requests to The Orphan Foundation bore no similarities to those stereotypical images.
The Smith Case – California
Madeleine Smith, the first recipient of an adoption assistance grant from our Foundation, is a very interesting woman. She describes herself as having a big heart, with an even bigger pile of bills. When she found her way to our Foundation, she was in the process of adopting Dang Jian, a “special needs” child from China. The name she chose for the 4-year old boy is “Elijah.” She describes Elijah as a wonderful child who loves to play outside, and is especially fond of toy cars. His fifth birthday will be in December, so she’s planning a very big celebration when he arrives.
But that is only a small piece of the story. Dang Jian was placed in the “special needs” category by his China orphanage, and given to an adoption agency in Oregon to place. Dang Jian is missing his right ear, which is accompanied by marginal hearing on that side. Adding to that malady are various urinogenital and colorectal problems. These factors, along with his age, also put him in the “hard-to-place” category of adoptions. And what does that mean? He was given this one last chance to be adopted before he would be permanently institutionalized in China.
If China and the adoption world considered Elijah’s problems as significantly daunting, why would a single mom struggling to grow a start-up music services business, step in to rescue him? Good question. But wait.  There is still another page to this story.
Elijah will be Madeleine’s third “special needs” child that she has adopted! And she also has a 22-year old college student son, Donovan. Madeleine’s other adopted children include her 7-year old son Michael, from Bulgaria, and her 3-year old daughter Hana, from Guatemala. And just to make this random act of love more difficult on her, Madeleine decided she had to move from her 2-bedroom apartment to a 3-bedroom apartment to make sure that there was enough room for Elijah in his new home.
Madeleine discovered Dang Jian, when a friend emailed her that she saw Dang Jian’s story on an adoption agency’s website, and described his impending fate. Madeleine found out that someone had put up an anonymous donation to help offset part of the adoption expenses, and that started Madeleine’s wheels in motion. With domestic adoptions averaging $18,105 currently, and almost double that internationally, due to travel costs, document translations and other country specific requirements, this was the opening break she needed. This was her chance to give Elijah a home, and she’d worry about the rest of his living and medical needs when he was in her care.
Madeleine has since arranged for the UCLA Craniofacial Center to replace Elijah’s missing ear. All she wanted from The Orphan Foundation was enough money to finish her legal paperwork with the State of California, get the legal documents translated into Chinese and certified, and have enough left over to pay her travel expenses to China to bring “Elijah” home.
When we asked her why she was doing this, she simply repeated what she said earlier – she has a big heart. The only anchor on that big heart seems to be that big pile of bills she’s managed to build in the process. Our Board could not have agreed more, and voted unanimously to grant her the money.
The Cancilla Case – California
Mary and Warren Cancilla, along with daughter Annalise, seemed truly overjoyed about 6-week old Harrison’s arrival. Harrison would be that new brother for Annalise, and the perfect one boy, one girl family would arrive in a small, quiet California town. However, this family portrait turns out to be a bit more unique than that. Harrison was born with Down syndrome, with the added rare heart complication called tetralogy of Fallot.
Mary, a sign language interpreter, told us that they had been on the Down Syndrome Association of Greater Cincinnati’s waiting list for 2 years. This seemed hardly a “spur of the moment” decision. When the association called to tell the Cancilla’s that Harrison’s mother decided to give him up, and they were on the top of the list to receive a Downs syndrome child, they were overjoyed that their long wait was finally over.
What did they want from The Orphan Foundation? Just some financial help with their adoption costs so that they could free up some money for the medical needs that Harrison will be facing.
Another unanimous vote, and another unnoticed random act of love from just a regular kind of family who chose to love a very special boy.
The Buckley Case – New York
When we talked with Lorraine Buckley she told us all about the incidents that led up to their finding Abrous, the brother of one of the two girls that they had already adopted from an orphanage in Liberia – an orphanage that had been overrun by soldiers during Liberia’s deadly civil wars. A badly beaten orphanage director managed to save the children from harm, by convincing the soldiers that some of the children might be their own. The soldiers confiscated all of the orphans’ food, but allowed the children to vacate the orphanage. The children walked for two days in search of shelter, with at most, a handful of rice for each day of their journey. The UN came to their rescue, and stepped in to provide them with blankets and food. Eventually the orphanage reopened, but everything was completely destroyed, including the children’s beds and toys.

</p><p><b></b></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Pablo </b></p>
<p>When I met my friend Pablo, he was selling coconut on the
street of Puerto Plata. Like most places in the Caribbean, there is a local
price for things, and then there is the price for the tourist. (Usually quite
higher than the local price)</p>
<p>I remember asking him cost of a single coconut. Even though
he had the opportunity to hike the price, he sold his coconuts to me at the
same low local price. I remember thinking to myself that this is an honest man.
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/812244/files/20140825223843-Pablo.JPG?1409031523"" src="""" style=""width: 618.6666666666666px; height: 464px;""/></p><br/><p>That was in 2012.  At
the time, I was there in the Dominican Republic with a group of co-workers on a
charity initiative to build some houses in a very deserving community. In 2013,
I went back to the Dominican Republic with another group of co-workers to once
again build some more houses in the same community, and just as he did in the
previous year, Pablo was there almost every day with his wheel barrow filled
with coconuts for sale, often drenched with perspiration from pushing his wheel
barrow over distances that we would never consider or contemplate. </p>
<p>After the building of the houses was completed, and the rest
of the group had returned to Canada, I stayed in the Dominican Republic for an
extended vacation. It was at that time that I visited Pablo at his home and saw
the condition of his house. (As bad as the pictures are, they really cannot
paint a truly accurate picture of how desperate his living condition really is)</p>
<p>In-spite of the crumbling and decaying condition of his
house, Pablo was excited to show me a picture of both of us that he had
displayed inside of his home. It was only after I started asking questions that
he explained to me what had happened and how his house had come to be in its
present condition.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/812248/files/20140825224424-front_of_house_1.jpg?1409031864"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 351px;""/></p><br/><p><b><u>A bit about my
friend Pablo</u></b></p>
<p>Pablo was born in the countryside about 40Kilometers from
Puerto Plata to a single mother living in poverty. When he was nine (9) years
old, his mother died and Pablo went to live with his grand father. Pablo
immediately started working in the field with his grand father, robbing him of
a normal childhood and education.</p>
<p>At age 17 he moved to Puerto Plata looking for a better
life. He got a job at a local hotel as a dishwasher. It was here that he met
his wife who was also working at the hotel as a waitress. A few years later,
the hotel closed rendering both Pablo and his wife unemployed with two small
children to take care off. </p>
<p>With the small severance package that they received, Pablo
and his wife started building a house for their young family. Unfortunately,
the funds quickly ran out and all construction came to a screeching halt.  That was about 10yers ago in 2004. Today
Pablo sells coconuts to try and support his family, and collects food scraps to
feed a few pigs that he is raising. </p>
<p><b><u>The Sad Reality</u></b></p>
<p>Pablo’s two little girls have now grown up to be teenagers,
their entire lives lived in what we would consider to be a broken down backyard
shed. Soon they will move on to start families of their own leaving Pablo and
his wife to live out their lives in this already crumbling structure, which

<br/></div>","Pablo 
When I met my friend Pablo, he was selling coconut on the
street of Puerto Plata. Like most places in the Caribbean, there is a local
price for things, and then there is the price for the tourist. (Usually quite
higher than the local price)
I remember asking him cost of a single coconut. Even though
he had the opportunity to hike the price, he sold his coconuts to me at the
same low local price. I remember thinking to myself that this is an honest man.
That was in 2012.  At
the time, I was there in the Dominican Republic with a group of co-workers on a
charity initiative to build some houses in a very deserving community. In 2013,
I went back to the Dominican Republic with another group of co-workers to once
again build some more houses in the same community, and just as he did in the
previous year, Pablo was there almost every day with his wheel barrow filled
with coconuts for sale, often drenched with perspiration from pushing his wheel
barrow over distances that we would never consider or contemplate. 
After the building of the houses was completed, and the rest
of the group had returned to Canada, I stayed in the Dominican Republic for an
extended vacation. It was at that time that I visited Pablo at his home and saw
the condition of his house. (As bad as the pictures are, they really cannot
paint a truly accurate picture of how desperate his living condition really is)
In-spite of the crumbling and decaying condition of his
house, Pablo was excited to show me a picture of both of us that he had
displayed inside of his home. It was only after I started asking questions that
he explained to me what had happened and how his house had come to be in its
present condition.A bit about my
friend Pablo
Pablo was born in the countryside about 40Kilometers from
Puerto Plata to a single mother living in poverty. When he was nine (9) years
old, his mother died and Pablo went to live with his grand father. Pablo
immediately started working in the field with his grand father, robbing him of
a normal childhood and education.
At age 17 he moved to Puerto Plata looking for a better
life. He got a job at a local hotel as a dishwasher. It was here that he met
his wife who was also working at the hotel as a waitress. A few years later,
the hotel closed rendering both Pablo and his wife unemployed with two small
children to take care off. 
With the small severance package that they received, Pablo
and his wife started building a house for their young family. Unfortunately,
the funds quickly ran out and all construction came to a screeching halt.  That was about 10yers ago in 2004. Today
Pablo sells coconuts to try and support his family, and collects food scraps to
feed a few pigs that he is raising. 
The Sad Reality
Pablo’s two little girls have now grown up to be teenagers,
their entire lives lived in what we would consider to be a broken down backyard
shed. Soon they will move on to start families of their own leaving Pablo and
his wife to live out their lives in this already crumbling structure, which
will eventually collapse around them. The sad truth is, that the older he
becomes, the less likely he is to complete what he had started ten years ago,
and the more likely that both walls and roof will cave in on itself. The goal
My goal is to help Pablo complete what he had started 10
years ago, and to finish the construction of his house so that he and his wife
can have a safe, dry place to call home. 
To achieve this goal, I need to raise a total of $10,000
(ten thousand) dollars for the cost of building materials, the cost of a local
contractor and workers, furnishings and appliances. The driving force
I believe that we all have the capacity to truly impact
other people’s lives in a most positive way with out the need, or desire for
compensation. It is our opportunity to perform truly selfless acts of kindness.
It is our opportunity to simply do Good.

If you have ever been to the Dominican Republic, or any
other Caribbean island for that matter on a sunny beach Vacation, then I urge
you to donate to this campaign. 
The lives of so many of the people living on the islands is
often far removed from the Resort lifestyle experienced while on Vacation.

<h2>SmartTerra Has Your Plants Covered!</h2>
<p>Terrariums are truly beautiful. They are like your little escape gardens. However, most of us can't even keep a simple potted plant alive, so, a terrarium would be the last thing you want to own. SmartTerra changes all that. SmartTerra is fully automatic and employs sensors that continuously monitor vital conditions of your ecosystem: water level, soil moisture, and temperature. When the soil is dry, SmartTerra waters your plants by generating rainfall. SmartTerra is the first autonomous terrarium that generates rainfall with realistic lighting and thunder sound effects when water is needed. Of course, you can make it rain anytime you want as well!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2>Listen and Follow Nature</h2>
<p>To make the rain effects believable, you can make sure that the light, sound, and raindrops are synchronized as realistic as possible: sky dimming, sounds of the rain, rolling thunder, and then comes the raindrops, flashes of thunder and ""bamm"" comes the sound! Cool!</p>

<p>Helios is a modular touch wall light. This design allows the user to effectively swipe where they want or need light, turning the walls into a canvas for illumination using their hand as the brush. The combination of modularity and the lighting controls equals a product that can be completely tailored by the user. This product provides the opportunity for a lighting solution that is specific to each and every environment.</p>

<p>This product consists of multiple plastic hexagons that can be connected together via magnets and interlocking patterns to form a touch screen wall light. The magnets that form the physical connection between components also allow the electricity to pass through from one piece to another.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<div data-id=""14532356""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Prototype on display and winning prizes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1488830294/ui7n0vvxxrvngpkkmimj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption><p>Prototype on display and winning prizes</p>
<p>With the power running through the product, each individual component is turned on and off via a capacitive touch sensor incorporated into each piece. The underlying idea for the product is to give the user the ability to turn the interior architecture of a space into the light source. It gives potential for the user to just swipe the surface of the wall and it will illuminate the path of their touch. Turning the interior architecture into a canvas for illumination with the users hand as the brush.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

<h2>Building the Display</h2></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The individual components can be easily pieced together via the magnets that are located around the edges of the product. The hexagonal shape allows the pieces to tessellate together and gives the opportunity for a variety of multiple different structures. This process allows the user to create a light that suits the needs they have. The customer can purchase as many units as they need.</p>

<p> </p></figure></div>
<h1><b>Swipe On / Swipe Off</b></h1>
<p>The wall lamp is turned on and off through the physical touch from the user. Using capacitive sensors as the switch, when the user's body comes into contact with the surface it will toggle each component on or off. This design allows the user to effectively swipe where they want or need light. Turning the interior architecture into a canvas for illumination with the users hand as the brush.</p>

<p>Currently up to 105 tiles can be joined on the same power circuit. Further testing and development will be done to increase this. Larger displays can be made by isolating the contacts between groups of tiles.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Wall Mounting</h1>
<p>Only the central units need to be rigidly connected, allowing the user to move around the other units to make different shapes. We tested various methods and the best solution was a choice of either nails or just sticky pads running around the perimeter of the rear face.</p>
<div data-id=""14532507""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1488830296/ik0tue5s17vozsiq5upi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Nails are the most secure attachment and a template for their placement would be provided with the product. The sticky tabs provide an alternative or a back up to the nail connection if mounting onto surfaces where nails cannot be used, for example glass or tiles.</p>

<h1><b>Pledging For Rewards (Please read)</b></h1>
<p>IMPORTANT: Indiegogo will only allow ONE pledge per person, you can not add expansion packs separately. Please choose the reward with the number of light panels required.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><b>Design</b></h1>
<p><b>Outer Shell</b></p>
<p>The two external parts for the product will be injection molded. Ribs have been added to all bosses in order to reduce sink marks and improve quality. The wall thickness has been kept uniform and consistent at l.5mm throughout the piece to ensure the quality and even cooling during the injection moulding process. The l.5mm thickness was chosen because it is within the optimal thickness range for the material and thin enough to allow for some of the intricate details.</p>

After motorsport world, James moved into the maritime sector, working first on a new marine propulsion technology, then as Head of Engineering Design for high performance powerboat company and as a technical design consultant within the maritime military industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>How it all started</h1>
<p>Currently spending most of his time on a new engine concept which is launching in 2017, James Glover happened to meet James Vanderpant at the Brighton Design Exhibition where he was demonstrating the Helios Lighting system. Instantly convinced by the concept, he offered his experience and contacts to develop the final design and release Helios Lighting to a wider market.</p>

</div></div>","Helios is a modular touch wall light. This design allows the user to effectively swipe where they want or need light, turning the walls into a canvas for illumination using their hand as the brush. The combination of modularity and the lighting controls equals a product that can be completely tailored by the user. This product provides the opportunity for a lighting solution that is specific to each and every environment.
A finger touch turns the panels on and off.
This product consists of multiple plastic hexagons that can be connected together via magnets and interlocking patterns to form a touch screen wall light. The magnets that form the physical connection between components also allow the electricity to pass through from one piece to another.
Prototype on display and winning prizes
With the power running through the product, each individual component is turned on and off via a capacitive touch sensor incorporated into each piece. The underlying idea for the product is to give the user the ability to turn the interior architecture of a space into the light source. It gives potential for the user to just swipe the surface of the wall and it will illuminate the path of their touch. Turning the interior architecture into a canvas for illumination with the users hand as the brush.
Create any shape and turn on individual panels as you swipe your hand across.
Building the Display
The individual components can be easily pieced together via the magnets that are located around the edges of the product. The hexagonal shape allows the pieces to tessellate together and gives the opportunity for a variety of multiple different structures. This process allows the user to create a light that suits the needs they have. The customer can purchase as many units as they need.

 
Swipe On / Swipe Off
The wall lamp is turned on and off through the physical touch from the user. Using capacitive sensors as the switch, when the user's body comes into contact with the surface it will toggle each component on or off. This design allows the user to effectively swipe where they want or need light. Turning the interior architecture into a canvas for illumination with the users hand as the brush.
Capacitive touch circuit

Dimensions

Currently up to 105 tiles can be joined on the same power circuit. Further testing and development will be done to increase this. Larger displays can be made by isolating the contacts between groups of tiles.
 
Wall Mounting
Only the central units need to be rigidly connected, allowing the user to move around the other units to make different shapes. We tested various methods and the best solution was a choice of either nails or just sticky pads running around the perimeter of the rear face.

Nails are the most secure attachment and a template for their placement would be provided with the product. The sticky tabs provide an alternative or a back up to the nail connection if mounting onto surfaces where nails cannot be used, for example glass or tiles.
 Customize
The combination of the modularity and the lighting control equals a product that can be completely tailored by the user. This product provides an opportunity for a lighting solution that is specific to each and every environment.

 
Power
Helios Touch is powered from a mains power supply supplied with the packs with the correct plug will be supplied for your location. The 120 / 220 v to 24v 2A adapter will power up to 35 panels. For larger displays additional power supplies can be plugged in to increase the capacity to up to 105 panels.

Power Adapter
Supplied with International Plugs

 
Pledging For Rewards (Please read)
IMPORTANT: Indiegogo will only allow ONE pledge per person, you can not add expansion packs separately. Please choose the reward with the number of light panels required.
 
Design
Outer Shell
The two external parts for the product will be injection molded. Ribs have been added to all bosses in order to reduce sink marks and improve quality. The wall thickness has been kept uniform and consistent at l.5mm throughout the piece to ensure the quality and even cooling during the injection moulding process. The l.5mm thickness was chosen because it is within the optimal thickness range for the material and thin enough to allow for some of the intricate details.

 Mold Flow Analysis

Reducing sink marks was an important area to address as the model was initially prone to the defects in a visible area. The sink marks have been reduced by reducing material in certain areas and also ribbing necessary bosses.

The materials used for the outer shell will be a key factor in optimizing manufacturing and functionality of the product. The outer shell will also need to meet industry standards for electronic device housing.
Requirements of the material:Strong enough to protect the internal components from some of the stresses the product may be exposed. These stresses may include the product being dropped on the floor and accidentally being stepped on.
Materials and Recycling

Noticing that plug sockets had not really been updated in over 100 years, he did what no one else thought to do - fix the problem.   Hot-swappable modules. Safe and secure, switch or replace the front modules between sockets easily and within a matter of moments.   We are developing and will be adding more modules to accommodate future appliances and devices as technology advances.     With two system designs, double In-wall socket or 4-way extension lead, myDOQ is easy and convenient to use whether you are at home or traveling. The myDOQ system can easily be installed. For the 'smart' modules simply replace the existing back box with the mydoq back box (not necessary with myDOQ 'dumb' sockets).  if you don’t want to install the backbox, simply use the 4-way extension lead and use straight out of the box.    Set up the myDOQ system to suit your lifestyle needs with multiple combinations.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Twirl was founded by Pam F. and Linda P. These beautiful women were drawn together by the teachings of connection and love! Their vision began through Pam's expertise in the gift industry and her work with Creative Candles.  It was there Pam initially developed the idea of TWIRL and found an opportunity to impact the lives of others with the thoughtfulness of gifts.  Linda has run Plaza Wellspring, a center for movement and mind/body connection, since 2005. This role connected her to Pam and allowed her to bring her passion to the work of uplifting others and to the business of Twirl.  Graphic designer, Rachel Eilts, took their passion and created the beautiful expression of TWIRL.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Together, these 3 women are the mind, heart and hands of TWIRL, and their collaboration will bring your loved ones a timeless gift of love.</p>

Help us launch the gift of Twirl
We need your help to make sharing the gift of Twirl a reality. We are working towards a goal of $50,000, with the breakout of how these expenses will be used shown in the chart below.  This will allow us access to the summer gift shows in 2016 with available inventory consisting of pillowcase gifts sets from Peacock Alley, and robes from ContourMD made with fabric from Fabri-Quilt. 

Help us achieve this by selecting one of the available perks. 

Who is TWIRL?
Twirl was founded by Pam F. and Linda P. These beautiful women were drawn together by the teachings of connection and love! Their vision began through Pam's expertise in the gift industry and her work with Creative Candles.  It was there Pam initially developed the idea of TWIRL and found an opportunity to impact the lives of others with the thoughtfulness of gifts.  Linda has run Plaza Wellspring, a center for movement and mind/body connection, since 2005. This role connected her to Pam and allowed her to bring her passion to the work of uplifting others and to the business of Twirl.  Graphic designer, Rachel Eilts, took their passion and created the beautiful expression of TWIRL.
Together, these 3 women are the mind, heart and hands of TWIRL, and their collaboration will bring your loved ones a timeless gift of love.

According to UN Refugee Agency, we are now witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record. An unprecedented <strong>65.3 million</strong> people around the world have been forced from home by the end of 2015. Among them are nearly <strong>21.3 million refugees</strong>, over half of whom are under the age of 18.

Some of the problems encountered with current shelters include:</p><ul>
<li>Lack of privacy and space</li>
<li>All family members forced to sleep in the same space</li>
<li>Leakage of rain water into the housing space</li>
<li>Lack of windows and sunlight</li>
<li>Overcrowding </li>
<li>Inadequate short term housing</li>
<li>Public health and sanitation issues associated with sharing public toilets</li>
</ul><h2>Solution</h2><p>As a team, we decided to develop an effective solution that not only addresses all the problems associated with current shelter structures at refugee camps, but that can also be quickly and easily assembled by the end user with very simple tools and no prior construction experience. Our design, the HEX HOUSE, is a:</p><ul>
<li>Dignified home that can serve as both a transitional and permanent shelter.</li>
<li>All components are designed to be packed and shipped flat, hence can be rapidly deployed by governments and relief agencies.</li>
<li>The Hexagonal shape is more structurally rigid than a square structure therefore eliminating the need for added structural support</li>
<li>It incorporates all the typical amenities of a home: private toilet, shower, kitchen, separate sleeping spaces and a living space.</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_insulated_panel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Structural Insulated Panel (SIPs)</a> walls, floors &amp; roof panels are durable and insulated therefore provide much needed privacy, and protection from harsh weather conditions</li>
<li>The 47 Square Meter (506 Square Feet) units are adaptable and scalable to accommodate larger families, and can be combined into various combinations of clusters to create shared gardens and gathering spaces that promote community engagement</li>
<li>Interior finishes can be easily customized, and the home can be easily disassembled, relocated and reused.</li>

Architects For Society's founders are twelve professionals and academics located in the US, Canada, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, India and Jordan who have come together to serve a common goal. We were all quite privileged to be able to go to the best schools and learn and gain experience designing for high profile clients…But with this PRIVILEGE came RESPONSIBILITY…There are many people both in our local communities and in other parts of the world whom, to no fault of their own, lack access to the most basic needs for food, water, and shelter. Whether they’ve built their own homes from repurposed and very humble or limited resources, or were victims of war-torn zones who were forced to flee their habitat altogether, we have found that as professionals, and before all as fellow humans, we have a shared responsibility and duty to fulfill towards the underprivileged. Therefore our mission was clear: to strive to enhance the built environment of disadvantaged communities through innovative architecture and design. We are focused on the needs of 3 main segments of society: informal settlements, refugee settlements, and low income housing.ProblemWith the massive influx of refugees in the last few years, we knew that addressing refugees’ dire need for decent shelter would be a top priority endeavor for us. According to UN Refugee Agency, we are now witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record. An unprecedented 65.3 million people around the world have been forced from home by the end of 2015. Among them are nearly 21.3 million refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18. To put it in perspective, the tally is greater than the population of the UK- or of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand combined!After resettlement, many refugees face crowded, noisy, dirty, disease filled grounds where thousands of families are cramped together and surviving one day at a time. Some of the problems encountered with current shelters include:
Lack of privacy and space
All family members forced to sleep in the same space
Leakage of rain water into the housing space
Lack of windows and sunlight
Overcrowding 
Inadequate short term housing
Public health and sanitation issues associated with sharing public toilets
SolutionAs a team, we decided to develop an effective solution that not only addresses all the problems associated with current shelter structures at refugee camps, but that can also be quickly and easily assembled by the end user with very simple tools and no prior construction experience. Our design, the HEX HOUSE, is a:
Dignified home that can serve as both a transitional and permanent shelter.
All components are designed to be packed and shipped flat, hence can be rapidly deployed by governments and relief agencies.
The Hexagonal shape is more structurally rigid than a square structure therefore eliminating the need for added structural support
It incorporates all the typical amenities of a home: private toilet, shower, kitchen, separate sleeping spaces and a living space.

Structural Insulated Panel (SIPs) walls, floors & roof panels are durable and insulated therefore provide much needed privacy, and protection from harsh weather conditions
The 47 Square Meter (506 Square Feet) units are adaptable and scalable to accommodate larger families, and can be combined into various combinations of clusters to create shared gardens and gathering spaces that promote community engagement
Interior finishes can be easily customized, and the home can be easily disassembled, relocated and reused.
Assembly:
Concrete pier foundations are dug and poured
Height adjustable steel legs are anchored to top of piers
Steel or timber beams are anchored to steel plate at the top of legs
Structural Insulated Panel or SIP floors are attached to the floor beams
SIP exterior and interior walls are then fastened to floor system
Interior and exterior finishes can be easily customized
Roof sip panels are anchored directly to the exterior walls with no need for added structure
A simple steel and timber porch is attached to the front of the home
Insulated windows, skylight and doors are installed
Finally, an aluminum gutter is attached to the roof panels
Radial clusters of five units create shared exterior spaces and amenities
The Hex House is designed to be an adaptable, scalable solution which promotes community engagement
The simplicity yet durability of the design, and the fact that the end user can construct the home himself with simple tools and no previous construction experience makes the Hex House a very cost effective solution with tremendous cost savings passed on to homeowners as a result.PossibilitiesRefugee camps were initially designed to be a short term remedy to an emergency situation, but the average stay is now 17 years! Some camps are already evolving into permanent settlements such as UNHCR’s Zaatari camp in Jordan hosting more than 80,000 refugees.Humanitarian experts are now proposing turning refugee camps into enterprise zones called “refugee cities”, a model that would benefit both the refugee and the host population. Major international financial institutions like the World Bank, have already committed to invest in refugee-inclusive Special Enterprise Zones (SEZs) in Jordan and Ethiopia.There is a rising awareness that the ""top-down"" strategies currently dealing with refugee situations are not working and we knew that change was bound to happen. Earlier this year, the UNHCR along with the IKEA Foundation ran the Refugee Challenge for the What Design Can Do conference in Amsterdam. The design competition sought ideas ""for accommodating, connecting, integrating and helping the personal development of refugees"". We submitted the Hex House design, and it was one of 5 projects shortlisted from over 150 shelter projects.  The Hex House was also this year’s recipient of the BEST OF BEST Iconic Award for visionary architecture from the German Design Council. Germany has been very welcoming, and in 2015 alone has opened its doors to almost 1 million refugees. They are seeking effective solutions for accommodating displaced families and AFS is there on the ground engaging with NGOs and policymakers to make the Hex House a viable solution.We have teamed up with two prominent engineering firms, in Frankfurt and Minneapolis to develop the engineering systems for the Hex House and build the prototype in the Spring of 2017. This will help us develop and fine tune our first Hex House for large scale production. Adaptable SolutionThe Hex House has a simple yet sophisticated design which makes it a SMART sustainable solution to much more than rapidly deployable refugee shelters. There is a large market for small efficient homes that are affordable and we plan to cater to this market with customizable Hex House kits that can be packed and shipped flat directly to consumers. By partnering with a large scale manufacturer, we will be able to minimize the cost of production and pass those savings on to the end user, who would additionally save on the huge cost of construction by building the Hex House themselves. Media coverageEver since we started the Hex House campaign and published the project in design publications, the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive! Every day we receive calls, emails, and inquiries asking about where and when they can buy the hex house. Many were keen to express that it is a much needed solution for housing shortages in many parts of the world. The world is rapidly changing and with that, our needs are changing too. With your help and support, we will be able to develop the Hex House prototype, and make available to society a rapidly deployable, scalable and affordable housing solution that is much needed in today’s world.See the Hex House Featured on the following publicationsDezeen, Inhabitat, Archinect, Fast Company, Curbed, Design Indaba, Core77, Gizmag, Azure, Design With Benefits and Midwest HomePerks",16.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>On Nov. 14, DePrimo spent his own $75 on winter boots for a homeless man who said he had never before owned a pair of shoes. Officer DePrimo's acted without expectation of repayment, reward, or recognition.  Join me in thanking him for what he's done, and giving him the resources to do even more.</p>
<p>A week before Thanksgiving, Jennifer Foster of Florence, AZ was visiting Times Square with her husband when they saw a shoeless man asking for change. As Foster explained to the NYPD: </p>
<p>“Right when I was about to approach, one of your officers came up behind him. The officer said, ‘I have these size 12 boots for you, they are all-weather. Let’s put them on and take care of you.’ The officer squatted down on the ground and proceeded to put socks and the new boots on this man. The officer expected NOTHING in return and did not know I was watching. I have been in law enforcement for 17 years. I was never so impressed in my life. I did not get the officer’s name. It is important, I think, for all of us to remember the real reason we are in this line of work. The reminder this officer gave to our profession in his presentation of human kindness has not been lost on myself or any of the Arizona law enforcement officials with whom this story has been shared.”</p>
<p>We all occasionally witness the needs of the sick and homeless on our city streets. Sometimes we offer change. More often we walk right by.

<p>Merry Christmas, Officer DePrimo. Thank you for reminding us to put kindness at the top of our Christmas lists.</p></div>","On Nov. 14, DePrimo spent his own $75 on winter boots for a homeless man who said he had never before owned a pair of shoes. Officer DePrimo's acted without expectation of repayment, reward, or recognition.  Join me in thanking him for what he's done, and giving him the resources to do even more.
A week before Thanksgiving, Jennifer Foster of Florence, AZ was visiting Times Square with her husband when they saw a shoeless man asking for change. As Foster explained to the NYPD: 
“Right when I was about to approach, one of your officers came up behind him. The officer said, ‘I have these size 12 boots for you, they are all-weather. Let’s put them on and take care of you.’ The officer squatted down on the ground and proceeded to put socks and the new boots on this man. The officer expected NOTHING in return and did not know I was watching. I have been in law enforcement for 17 years. I was never so impressed in my life. I did not get the officer’s name. It is important, I think, for all of us to remember the real reason we are in this line of work. The reminder this officer gave to our profession in his presentation of human kindness has not been lost on myself or any of the Arizona law enforcement officials with whom this story has been shared.”
We all occasionally witness the needs of the sick and homeless on our city streets. Sometimes we offer change. More often we walk right by. Yet our police officers don't have the luxury of ignoring the needs of our most vulnerable citizens. Their hearts ache as much as ours do for what they witness, and for their lack the resources to address the problem.
That's why I'm petitioning to help Officer DePrimo do more of what he's already done - to help those he thinks could best use it. The Larry DePrimo Act of Kindness Fund will allow police officers, police departments, and community organizations of Officer DePrimo's choosing to help the sick and the homeless in the recognition and remembrance of Officer DePrimo's striking and selfless act of kindness.
Officer DePrimo gave $75 to the cause on that chilly night. I'm giving $150 here and now. What can you give?
Merry Christmas, Officer DePrimo. Thank you for reminding us to put kindness at the top of our Christmas lists.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><strong>Unique switch transmitter encoding is generated upon the initial flicking of the switch transmitter, this address code is then the device ID code to be transmitted and paired with the receiver device. The receiver learns the address code by a user simply pressing in a button switch on the receiver and whilst holding the button switch in, the switch transmitter is flicked. That's all there is to pairing the switch transmitter ID code to the receiver where it is stored in an address storage memory block. To dim the controlled light, simple move the slide control to the extreme right for full 100% brightness, and extreme left for minimum brightness. The slide control is linear so mid position gives 50% brightness.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Using 128 bit binary encoding gives 3.4 x 10^38 number combinations. By comparison there are 10^24 number of stars in the known Hubble Universe. Ergo, one never has to worry about turning on or off a neighbor's lights as well as your own.</strong></h3>

<h3 align=""JUSTIFY""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;""><span>The FLIK’r Switch is based on ISM ENIGMA, LLC's international patents pending technology (see note #3 in red below) in a switch form, which creates its own power by the flicker action/activation of the switch. The first time the customer ""flicks"" the switch power on the FLIK’r Switch, power is generated to the microcontroller/microchip transmitter run by the patent pending wireless communication software, sending a signal, using proprietary software, to the receiving light fixture. It automatically communicates and pairs with the light fixture enhanced with a wireless receiver which has been connected to a usual power sources (i.e. ceiling, table top or other routine lighting systems). Once paired, the wireless connection between the mobile switch and the lighting fixture is permanently established. A flick of the switch will now turn the light on or off, or on at varied levels of intensity/dimming. Installation is reduced to connecting the lighting fixture/receiver to a power source and pairing the switch to the fixture. No other installation costs or labor is required.</span></span></h3>

No batteries!

   This international patent pending scalable energy harvesting generator invented by Dr. Deak eliminates the need for any batteries in the switch remote enclosure.
 
 
 
 
 
The switch does not need to be mounted on walls but it can. Also can be carried on person or docked in a wall sleeve and no need to poke holes in walls.
The switch transmitter sends switch and dim data on an ISM (Industrial Scientific & Medical Band) frequency of 915 MHz (USA) and 868 MHz (UK/EU).
The switch receiver is powered by the AC mains and will automatically adapt and operate on either 120 VAC @ 60 Hertz (in USA) or 220 VAC @ 50 Hertz (in UK and the EU).
One switch (as shown below) can control an unlimited number of receivers and each receiver can handle a plurality of lights or other electrical loads up to its maximum wattage limit for multi-lighting situations. A range of power handling versions will be marketed as part of Phase II design and marketing steps. 
Also up to 32 switches can control one receiver. 
 Actually people find our FLIK'r Switch fun to operate. Some have even imposed a time out for family members wanting to over FLIK the FLIK'r. It's like excersing or squeezing a rubber ball for therapy..........NO BATTERIES!...........NO WORRIES!......A milli-calorie burner as well.
 
Each receiver has 32 memory storage locations for different addresses and when the memory storage locations are all filled up any additional addresses will be rejected, however this receiver has a reset button to clear all addresses and make all new 32 address mamory space free for any re-addressing decisions. 
 

 
Unique switch transmitter encoding is generated upon the initial flicking of the switch transmitter, this address code is then the device ID code to be transmitted and paired with the receiver device. The receiver learns the address code by a user simply pressing in a button switch on the receiver and whilst holding the button switch in, the switch transmitter is flicked. That's all there is to pairing the switch transmitter ID code to the receiver where it is stored in an address storage memory block. To dim the controlled light, simple move the slide control to the extreme right for full 100% brightness, and extreme left for minimum brightness. The slide control is linear so mid position gives 50% brightness.
Using 128 bit binary encoding gives 3.4 x 10^38 number combinations. By comparison there are 10^24 number of stars in the known Hubble Universe. Ergo, one never has to worry about turning on or off a neighbor's lights as well as your own.
 

The FLIK'r Switch Transmitter                                    Internal View
Size: 100 x 64 x 15 mm.
Weight: 95 grams
Colors: various including transparent
 

The FLIK'r Switch System                                      Clear plastic
                                                                              (Perks #9, #10)
(868 MHz EU/UK version)
 
What will FLIK'r switch and dim?

The present model receiver rated @ 300 Watts for 120 VAC 60 Hertz or 220 VAC 50 Hertz loads will switch any one of these:
3 - 100 Watt Incandescent bulbs or 6 - 50 Watt Incandescent bulbs.
60 - 4.5 Watt LED lights (if the LED lights are dimmable then FLIK'r can dim them). Note #1: 4.5 Watt LED light give the brilliance of a 60 Watt Incandescent light.
20 - 14 Watt CFL lights (brilliance of a 100 Watt Incandescent light). NOTE: Dimmable CFL lights require a special dimmer, and will not be dimmed by conventional wired in dimmers. The “maybe” answer in the above table refers to the FLIK'r being able to dim some dimmable CFL lights, but not all.
The FLIK'r will switch and dim a fan up to 300 Watts of power consumption.
 
Some surpise applications that FLIK'r Switches can be used for:
1) Hotel Taxi Calling SystemEach bellman has a Transmitter to control a stop/go light at a taxi stand.
2) Combat Simulation Demolitions TrainingUS government, specific application unknown
3) Senior Call for Assistance SystemFor assisted living facilities, patient flicks Transmitter to call for help.
4) Casino Table Service CallsDealer flicks Transmitter to call for chips, drinks, etc.
5) Control of Lift for the Handicapped
6) Doctor is Ready for PatientDoctor flicks a Transmitter in the examining room to turn on a signal to the nurse's station.
7) Control Lights on Docks/Boats from Shore/House
8) Control Christmas Tree Lights or to Control All of Your Holiday Window Candles at Once
9) Control Computer Monitors in Classrooms
10) Factory Floor AlertsWorker flicks a Transmitter to control a remote signal to call for assistance, inspection, etc.
11) Control Landscape Lighting, Fountains, Pumps for Ponds, etc.
12) “Safe from Shock Hazard” Light Controls for Use in Wet AreasFor kitchens, bathrooms, pool areas, Jacuzzis, etc. 
The FLIK'r Switch Transmitters generate their own power.
They have no outside source of electricity -- so there is no danger of electrical shock.
13) One FLIK'r Control of Store Fixture LightingOne Transmitter is used to control all showcase lights in entire store.
14) Back Lighting of Framed Art (or other portable battery powered mobile use).A special 12V Lightning Receiver controls battery-powered lamp that backlights framed art.
15) Individual Control of Overhead Lights in Office Cubicle AreaEach cubicle has its own wireless/batteryless control to switch on/off ceiling lighting.

ISM ENIGMA, LLC. is a Long Island, NY based development-stage company formed in 2012 to develop the unique and groundbreaking inventions of inventor and Physicist, Dr. David Deak, CTO. Consisting of 3 founding members, Dr. Deak, Ronald Ranieri, CFO and Robert Heppenheimer, CEO; ISM ENIGMA is proud to present its first product for final commercialization. Based on international patent pending technologies, the FLIK'r switch is the first, simple, cost effective and easy to install wireless and battery-less (self powered) light switch technology (with a dimming feature) geared specifically for both the home and commercial markets. 
 
With the completion of Phase I testing, the initial production demonstration switches have proven to be effective and reliable at long ranges, through concrete and other usual real world building obstacles. With this milestone achieved, ISM ENIGMA, LLC is now seeking funding to complete our Phase II commercialization process of this innovative light switching (or any electrical load device) product and bring this new technology into both the national and international markets.
 
Previous Funding and Future Funding Needs
 
ISM ENIGMA, LLC. has been funded by the founding partners thus far. This funding has brought the Flik’r lighting switch technology from a concept to a working production type demonstration model. It is funding the next stage to commercialize the product where we need help in making this available worldwide.
 
Current Team and Required Skill sets
ISM ENIGMA, LLC has 3 founding partners:
Dr. David Deak, Ph.D. in Physics is the Chief Technology Officer 
Mr. Robert Heppenheimer, MPA is the Chief Executive Officer
Mr. Ronald Ranieri, MBA is the Chief Financial Officer
 
With contributions, ISM Enigma will be able to make final beneficial improvements in the design process for minimizing the production costs, and obtaining testing for UL and CE approval and certification; as well as making design packaging for shipment. 
 
 
ISM ENIGMA, LLC. has successfully completed transmitter and receiver circuit hardware designs, and software design including final testing of the first 40 switches engineered and produced on behalf of ISM ENIGMA by our manufacturer Ultraflex, Inc. a Long Island design company with manufacturing facilities in Sofia, Bulgaria. 20 switches are geared to the U.S. market, the other 20 for European markets. The only difference between the U.S. and European devices is the operating frequency in compliance with U.S.'s FCC and the EU's R&TTE (Council on Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment) and patents are pending in the US and EU for the switch and the underlying software.
With working demonstration models, it is anticipated that additional work needs to be done to streamline the manufacturing process to bring the costs down for the final product. We will reduce the circuitry size by using hybrid micro chips, which will be part of the funding useage costs.
If our entire funding goal is not reached, the funds will be directly applied to paying the contract manufacturer Ultraflex, Inc. (http://ultraflex.net/) to begin Phase II design modifications and get the product UL tested and approved initially to sell in the USA. If our goal is reached then we can have CE certification as well for UK and EU marketing and sales.
 
Projected roll-out timeline: Note #2: Timeline begins after Indiegogo closing.
* Completion of commercialization 9 months
* Marketing Planning and Strategy 3 - 6 months (concurrent)
* Develop Manufacturing/Distribution Strategies 9 months (concurrent)
* Launch marketing plan  Begin in month 9
* First Sales in U.S. market Begin in month 10
* First Sales Internationally Begin in month 13
 
Detailed Product Overview
The FLIK’r Switch is based on ISM ENIGMA, LLC's international patents pending technology (see note #3 in red below) in a switch form, which creates its own power by the flicker action/activation of the switch. The first time the customer ""flicks"" the switch power on the FLIK’r Switch, power is generated to the microcontroller/microchip transmitter run by the patent pending wireless communication software, sending a signal, using proprietary software, to the receiving light fixture. It automatically communicates and pairs with the light fixture enhanced with a wireless receiver which has been connected to a usual power sources (i.e. ceiling, table top or other routine lighting systems). Once paired, the wireless connection between the mobile switch and the lighting fixture is permanently established. A flick of the switch will now turn the light on or off, or on at varied levels of intensity/dimming. Installation is reduced to connecting the lighting fixture/receiver to a power source and pairing the switch to the fixture. No other installation costs or labor is required.
 
Note #3: There are three international patents pending, one for the energy harvesting generator that powers the switch transmitter, one for the switch system itself and one for the system software (firmware).
 
Why This Invention Is Needed In the Marketplace?
Conventional switches require significant wiring to connect to a device (i.e. lighting fixture). In addition one must also include the wiring necessary to bring electrical power to the lighting fixture itself. Both devices (switch and fixture) require a fixed permanent positioning as well as the cost of wire and the labor of doing the wiring. (Note: there are currently in the market, a few battery operated wireless switches.) 
With the ISM ENIGMA, LLC FLIK’r Switch, technology takes a leap forward: the switch has no wires nor batteries. It generates its own power when flicked and sends a signal to a light fixture that is connected to a FLIK'r receiver to turn on and off and dim as specified. It makes the switch totally mobile and it never needs to have any batteries that need to be changed periodically, thus saving money on the wires, wiring, as well as the cost of batteries if compared to a battery operated wireless switch. Additionally it eliminates the battery disposal problems inherent with battery operated devices making for a less toxic environment contribution. 
 
Discussion
With new technologies changing our lives, few have the real world, daily impact as much as lighting. Each and every day, several times a day, we reach for a lighting switch while walking in and out of a room, never giving the switch and its fixed position and required wiring to both power and its related lighting fixture a moments thought. The costs of material, and underlying time and labor costs required for conventional lighting systems add significant cost to all new construction and renovation projects in both commercial and residential building sites. Never mind the cost of removal and disposal when renovation time comes.
Imagine a new world where remotely controlled lighting switches do not need external power and can connect to a lighting fixture, wirelessly. ISM ENIGMA, LLC has invented the FLIK’r Switch (*) the first completely wireless and battery-less self-powered remote controlled switch specifically geared to the consumer. Once freed from the wires, switches become mobile and can wirelessly connect to a light fixture via specially designed proprietary software (*). This ground-breaking technology can be applied to any lighting device(s) requiring on/off switching/dimming and saves significant time, labor and material costs during construction. Additionally, there are significant benefits to the end-user consumer including ease of use, mobility and flexibility that have heretofore been impossible or very expensive.
(*) International patents pending.

I know for a job of this size, $700 is in the low ballpark range but we can make up the difference if it's any higher.We are offering the following for donations:$25 - get 20% off your next computer repair$100 - get 20% off computer repairs for life$150 - get 25% off computer repairs for life plus a free CAMTech t-shirt

Other Ways You Can HelpPlease let your friends and neighbors know we need help. It's difficult for small computer stores like ours to stay in business with big places like The Geek Squad to compete with. Also, if you know a sign shop who might be able to give us a better price on the lettering removal and replacement that would be a great referral.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>The Cool Hook Story</strong></h2>
<p>The Cool Hook is a new innovative product for coolers. Instead of sitting your cooler on the ground or on a bench, hang your coolers with The Cool Hook! Field tested and lab tested for durability. Use The Cool Hook at parks, construction sites, camping areas, softball / baseball games and anywhere else you can use a cooler. We are confident that this will be the best selling cooler accessory sold across the nation because there isn't anything like this being sold. In order to keep our costs down we need to make large order. With the support of our Indiegogo fans we can bring this product into retail locations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holds 5 and 10 gallon water coolers</li>
<li>Also holds small to large sized food coolers</li>
<li>Lab tested to hold up to 800 lbs </li>
<li>Keep your coolers off the ground, tables and benches</li>
</ul><h2><strong>This is why we're here</strong></h2>
<p><strong>In order to keep our manufacturing costs down we need to make a large order. </strong>We need to raise $15,250.00 to cover our first order plus shipping costs so we can send out our preorders to all of you wonderful Indiegogo fans. With your support we can make The Cool Hook a huge success!</p>
<h2><strong>Make your coolers a little bit Cooler</strong></h2>
<p>Do you or someone you know go to baseball or softball games? How about camping? The Cool Hook should be and will be on every construction site everywhere. </p>
<p>Our funding success stands on the outcome of this Indiegogo campaign. If we don't raise the funds from the support of Indiegogo then we'll find our selves in a tough place to try and raise capital, which is extremely critical in getting our first order made. I have ACE Hardware lined up as one of our retail locations to start selling The Cool Hook but we can't fulfill any orders if we are unable to raise these funds. Your support means a lot! It's always been my dream to be a creative inventor. With the success of this product we will be able to build our business and work on the other products in our portfolio.   </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Hey who do you KNOW ?</strong></h2>
<p>I understand that not everyone can contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help: Help us by spreading the word :)</p>
<p>Can you do us a huge favor? Send this link out to your friends and family. By sending this out to the social networks you are connected to, you might single handily help get us funded. I truly believe you can, so just take a few moments and let someone know. Good deeds never go unlooked and we appreciate your support. </p>
<p>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>All of you supporters are Amazing!</p>
<p>Thank You so much</p>

Lab tested to hold up to 800 lbs 
Keep your coolers off the ground, tables and benches
This is why we're here
In order to keep our manufacturing costs down we need to make a large order. We need to raise $15,250.00 to cover our first order plus shipping costs so we can send out our preorders to all of you wonderful Indiegogo fans. With your support we can make The Cool Hook a huge success!
Make your coolers a little bit Cooler
Do you or someone you know go to baseball or softball games? How about camping? The Cool Hook should be and will be on every construction site everywhere. 
Our funding success stands on the outcome of this Indiegogo campaign. If we don't raise the funds from the support of Indiegogo then we'll find our selves in a tough place to try and raise capital, which is extremely critical in getting our first order made. I have ACE Hardware lined up as one of our retail locations to start selling The Cool Hook but we can't fulfill any orders if we are unable to raise these funds. Your support means a lot! It's always been my dream to be a creative inventor. With the success of this product we will be able to build our business and work on the other products in our portfolio.   
 
Hey who do you KNOW ?
I understand that not everyone can contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help: Help us by spreading the word :)
Can you do us a huge favor? Send this link out to your friends and family. By sending this out to the social networks you are connected to, you might single handily help get us funded. I truly believe you can, so just take a few moments and let someone know. Good deeds never go unlooked and we appreciate your support. 
Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!
All of you supporters are Amazing!
Thank You so much

Yet until now, our only insight is an abstract and sometimes costly bill at the end of the month.Meet bluebot™, an intelligent clamp-on universal water meter that solves these issues, and more. Featuring real time flow data, custom alerts, and the ability to Dollarize™ your usage, bluebot helps you effectively and proactively monitor your property’s water from anywhere.Are you familiar with water shut offs and pipe cutting? Thanks to bluebot, you don’t have to be. Simply clamp it on and you're on your way to control. After bluebot is on your pipe, plug in to power, open the app and connect via Wi-Fi.The bluebot device can be placed on main line or irrigation, pool house, guest house, individual property units, and more. We recommend using bluebot on single family homes, townhouses, condos and apartments, small businesses, second homes – really, any property you can think of up to a 2” water line.The bluebot device is an essential tool for home owners, property managers, vacation rental companies, HOA’s, disaster preparedness companies, small business owners, and more.We are in production. Backing this campaign with a product purchase guarantees you will receive the product. We will be delivering the first units in October 2020.Shipping is complete! As of November, 2020, all backer orders have been fulfilled! Thank you so much for your support! To order your own bluebot with the quickest fulfillment, we recommend ordering directly through shop.bluebot.com As a special thank you, every single backer who gets a bluebot device will be grandfathered in to an Indiegogo exclusive VIP bluebot™ account, ensuring there are no additional fees, ever. As our campaign continues to grow, new perks & features will be unlocked. Be sure to share with your friends to keep the updates coming!The first 100 bluebot devices will come with an exclusive VIP backer edition hat and rapid fulfillment. Throughout the development of bluebot, we've heard countless water stories about leaks while a property was left unattended, surprise water bills, toilets refilling for hours on end, and rogue irrigation systems to name a few. We've heard them all, and they're almost always bad (and expensive).We're ready to change the narrative, making your next water story a good one with bluebot.Property Owner's Story“I noticed that my water usage was increasing but I was not doing anything differently. I could not figure out where the excess water was going. With bluebot, I could easily see when different devices were using water. I looked at my recent usage and found one of my low-flow toilets was flushing more water than intended – a lot more water. We were able to quickly find the problem and shut off the water, then get a replacement kit from the hardware store and resolve the problem. It was great to have the ability to see my water usage in detail and know that I can help our community save water during a drought!”   -James Vacation Rental Owners“I wish I had bluebot sooner. A few months ago, I had a huge leak at my vacation rental property that resulted in a $1200 bill! I live a few hours away, and the house often goes unattended for weeks at a time. I have other smart home devices that allow me to monitor other parts of my home, but nothing has been available like bluebot. I am so happy I found this device! I put two on my vacation rental – One on the main line and another on the irrigation. The irrigation line is especially useful for me to avoid overwatering. I’ve ordered another to put on my main house because it’s so easy to control from within the app!”-TerrySmall Business Owners“As a small business during COVID, we’re doing everything we can to get a better handle on our monthly expenses. Water is one of the most ambiguous utilities we pay. It’s extremely hard to get a grasp on where it might be going. I  have started reducing my monthly usage and with their cool Dollarize feature, I can keep track of what my bill is looking like day to day throughout the month. No more surprises!”- Robert When bluebot identifies constant or erratic water use, you'll get alerted of a possible leak or that water has been left running, allowing you to take action to protect your property (and wallet) from potential damage.This is especially important for those who manage multiple properties at once or are highly conscious of their monthly expenses, such as vacation rental owners and small business owners.The bluebot device can be placed indoors or outdoors. You should not dunk bluebot into a pool, but bluebot is water resistant so you can place it on outdoor water lines such as irrigation without worry.Have you ever wondered what your monthly water bill looks like broken down into weekly or daily intervals? Have you ever found yourself wondering how much you’re spending on hand washing compared to your dishwasher, or if your irrigation is costing you more than you’d like?We did. That is why we integrated the ability to Dollarize your usage into the bluebot app. Most people relate usage to dollars, not gallons.All municipalities charge for water a little differently based on a variety of factors. You can have bluebot reference average national rates or go custom by adding your own water bill so bluebot can calculate your particular costs.Simply toggle your view to see how much each water event or usage period is costing you. You can also create dollar-specific alerts to get notified throughout your billing cycle, or opt-in to the integrated coaching program to have bluebot intelligently (and practically) guide you to achieving your goals.Capturing around 43,200 data points per day, bluebot captures live flow data and shows it in the app within just seconds, sometimes faster. Real time flow data is relayed through our cloud to your mobile device no matter where you are. Our state-of-the-art high-resolution capture of flow readings allow our platform to display your water usage and patterns in unprecedented detail.While live flow is great for capturing events as they happen, historic data allows you to analyze trends and pinpoint specific water events. The bluebot app’s graph displays Live, 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month, 3 Months & Custom Date Ranges. You can view and scroll through the past week, month, or 3 months to analyze trends. Simply press and hold on the bar to zero in on that day, then pinch & zoom even further to get even more detail for that period. You can also drag a window around a range of spikes to determine your usage and Dollarize the cost. The bluebot app includes an optional coaching program. It uses your monthly bill and your savings goal to automatically update you throughout the month on your progress. Simply ask bluebot to help you save on your monthly bill. Take total control with the robust alerting and notification options within the bluebot app. Unlike other water meters that only notify you when they see fit, bluebot puts you in total control. Set alerts based on your monitoring preferences: flow over time, gallons, dollars, irrigation and more. We're constantly brainstorming new alert formats as we receive feedback from our bluebot community!Our newest alert will allow you to start tracking your usage as you begin washing your car, and notify you when you reach a dollar limit.Have you ever wondered what day of the week you use the most water? Or the longest amount of time you left the water running?Thanks to bluebot's configurable statistics, now you can easily see your water data at a glance. Toggle and prioritize daily total gallons, highest flow rate, longest continuous flow, peak usage day and time, and your total water savings since adding bluebot onto your property.Similar to alerts, we are constantly thinking of new statistics we can add to make bluebot even more useful to analyze your water trends.Through the bluebot app, you can connect endless bluebot devices and manage multiple devices across many properties with ease, from anywhere in the world. The most common application is placing one on your property's main line, and another on your irrigation line. You can share your devices, and have devices shared with you to help family & friends keep an eye on their property's water usage, as well. In 2017, our founders set to work developing a compact, universal flow meter that could be installed by anyone, nearly anywhere. Over the next three years, the device's effortless installation and technology was refined, brand, interface design, and feature set began, with a focus on ultimate simplicity. bluebot evolution 2017-2020The bluebot device meets all requisite standards required of consumer electronic devices set by the FCC and CE.

Thanks to our wonderful backers, we will be starting our Android app development very soon. Backers should expect the Android app to be released near the end of 2020. Please check back often for updates.   If you have any questions, at any time during or after the campaign has closed, you can always reach out to a member of our team at hello@bluebot.com If you’d like to write a story about bluebot, feel free to contact Nicole at nicole@bluebot.com and we would be happy to send along our media kit as well as answer any questions you may have.What’s your water story?

<p><strong>CookieNAV*</strong> is a small device which is always in your car to help you in the most important moments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Are you looking for a parking spot?</strong> CookieNav will help you find it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Did you forget where you had parked your car?</strong> CookieNav will lead you to it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Are you driving?</strong> CookieNav and its community of users will warn you about troublesome points, such as traffic jams, accidents and speed controls.</li>
</ul><p><strong>*[Patent Pending #P201300086]</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cookienav.com/images/20130505092438-18.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<h2>Why We Created CookieNAV Device</h2>
<p>Righ now, there are 'apps' for SmartPhones that will find you a parking spot and also save the location of your car, but you have to <strong>manually</strong> launch the 'app' and pin the location on a map each and every time you leave a street parking spot, or car your park. Stopping to lunch an 'app' while you are trying to get to or or from the office or running to catch a plane is a waste of time and very annoying.</p>
<p>So we developed the <strong>CookieNAV</strong> device that allows the SmartPhone to <strong>automatically</strong> find you a parking spot and <strong>automatically</strong> remember the last place you parked your car. <strong>The only time</strong> you have to launch the 'app' is if and when you need to find a parking spot or to find your car, <strong>and never at any other time</strong>, as it is all <strong>AUTOMATIC!</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cookienav.com/images/20130505092438-18.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Our Goal and Benefits When Using CookieNAV</h2>
<p>To help you find a parking spot in any city in the world. You will save time and money while contributing to reduce the pollution and traffic jams we suffer every day. We intend to deliver <strong>100.000</strong> devices CookieNav in 2014. Will you help us accomplish this goal?</p>
<p>And don’t worry! CookieNav will help you <strong>automatically</strong> so that you will not have to do anything!</p>

<h2>What´s Inside CookieNAV</h2>
<p>CookieNAV uses Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy which, due to its low consumption, provides a large autonomy without the need of cables or permanent connection. CookieNav only requires a CR2032 button cell battery. Besides, it contains an accelerometer which allows to automatically detect the vehicle’s movement.</p>

<h2>How Does COOKIENAV Work?</h2>
<p>Stick CookieNav to your vehicle’s dashboard and let it make your life easier.</p>
<h3>FIND A PARKING SPOT</h3>
<p>Access the application on your Smartphone to indicate you are looking for a parking spot. You will automatically receive geopositioning information about potential free places near you, multiplying like this your probabilities of finding a place to park.</p>
<p>This is how we get the information that will help you to park saving time and money:</p>
<p>When someone gets in his car, CookieNAV connects automatically to your Smartphone through its Bluetooth 4.0 and it informs the system that someone is getting in his car to, probably, leave a free parking place. This information is distributed ANONYMOUSLY between the users who are looking for a spot in the area through the mobile application.</p>
<p>Once the car starts, the accelerometer of the CookieNAV detects movement and notifies the rest of the users (anonymously) that, indeed, the parking spot is free.</p>
<p>With this geolocated information, the application will lead you to that free spot.</p>
<p>The position of free spots will disappear from the system after a few minutes, since we cannot guarantee they will remain free after a certain period of time.</p>
<p><img alt=""CookieNAV finding a parking"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cookienav.com/images/1-%20CookieNAV%20parking.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">FIND MY CAR</span></h3>
<p>Once you have parked in your destination, CookieNAV will detect you have left your vehicle when the connection between your BlueTooth and your Smartphone is lost, keeping in that moment your car’s GPS position automatically.</p>
<p>Later, if you cannot remember where you parked, you will be able to use the application in order to find your vehicle without having to worry about saving your position previously.</p>
<p><img alt=""CookieNAV Find my car"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cookienav.com/images/2-%20CookieNAV%20park-car.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>SOCIAL BUTTON</h3>
<p>CookieNAV has a button which allows to share with the rest of the users different events you come across with while you are driving. Increasing the number of events will always be decided by the CookieNAV community.</p>
<p>In order to simplify its use, the social button is associated to a unique type of event. As long as you do not change it through the mobile application, you just have to press the button of your CookieNav when you find an event so that its position and category can be distributed to the rest of the users.</p>
<p>Naturally, when you are driving your vehicle the application on your Smartphone will warn you when you are approaching any interest point which had been selected by other users with their social button.</p>

<p><img alt=""CookieNAV PCB Boards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cookienav.com/images/CookieNAV%20Perspectives.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>While we finish the development we still have to work on the FCC/CEE certifications, the manufacturing, the product support and complete all the tests in real environments.</p>
<p>Regarding the certification of the product our inmediate plan is to present it to a lab in order to obtain the FCC and the CEE certificates for the USA and the EU respectively. We hope the first part of the certification phase will be completed by the beginning of October, although our previous experience in these projects tells us it is difficult to know precisely the date of the approval’s finalisation. After this, we are going to present the APP to Apple for its approval and subsequently Android’s.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Approvals and certifications:</strong> approving and certificating any product involves a high economic investment. Our experience with some of our previous products makes us cautious about deadlines even if it is also true that these products presented a great complexity at many levels. However, given that the components of CookieNav are of great quality and all of them are separately certified, we are optimistic in this regard.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<strong>Community of users:</strong> this is one of the main challenges we must FACE in this project: getting the biggest possible number of users in order to achieve an intensive use of the application with an important number of movements. THE BIGGER THE NUMBER OF USERS, THE BIGGER THE QUANTITY OF INFORMATION AND GREATER POSSIBILITIES TO FIND A PARKING PLACE. That is why we will NOT send the founders’ cookies by order but by users’ volume for city. Thus, once you receive your cookies a high number of users can start IMMEDIATELY to use it with good results.

<strong>Collision detection:</strong> CookieNAV uses a 3-axis accelerometer capable of detecting if there is a sharp acceleration or deceleration which would allow CookieNAV to inform of a possible accident by sending our location to any of our contacts.</li>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>What is Bluetooth 4.0?</strong></p>
<p>Bluetooth low energy (BLE) branded as Bluetooth SMART since 2011 is a wireless computer network technology which is aimed at novel applications in the healthcare, fitness, security, and home entertainment industries. Compared to ""Classic"" Bluetooth, BLE is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and lower cost, whilst maintaining a similar communication range.</p>
<p><strong>What is an accelerometer?</strong></p>
<p>An accelerometer is an electromechanical device that will measure acceleration forces. These forces may be static or they could be dynamic - caused by moving or vibrating the accelerometer.</p>
<p><strong>What is a CookieNAV Limited Edition?</strong></p>
<p>This is an IndieGogo exclusive. Receive one of our first CookieNAV LE in matt black especially designed for the Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p><strong>How long will the battery in my CookieNAV last?</strong></p>
<p>Because we are using new Bluetooth Low Energy technology, the battery will last approximately 1 year.</p>
<p><strong>How do I replace the battery in my CookieNAV?</strong></p>
<p>The back of the CookieNAV twists off without the use of any tools, making changing the battery quick and easy.</p>
<p><strong>Do i have to connect my Smartphone to CookieNAV everytime i get in my car?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NO</strong>. You only need to start the application on your Smartphone once and from that moment everytime you get in your car CookieNAV will automatically connect without having to do anything on your Smartphone. The sending of your position will always be anonymous without having to do anything with the rest of the users, EVEN IF YOU HAVE YOUR SMARTPHONE IN YOUR POCKET.</p>
<p><strong>What phones and tablets are compatible with CookieNAV?</strong></p>
<p>CookieNAV works with your iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad Mini, New iPod Touch, Samsung Galaxy S3, Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, and other Android Bluetooth 4.0 phones.</p>
<p><strong>How accurate is the position of free places?</strong></p>
<p>The accuracy of GPS data depends on many factors. For example, the quality of the GPS receiver, the position of the GPS satellites at the time the data was recorded, the characteristics of the surroundings (buildings, tree cover, valleys, etc) and even the weather.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use the APP and CookieNav even if there are not enough users in my area sharing parking places?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, although we will send the CookieNAV according to groups of the same city, it is possible that some of them may not have, IN THE BEGINNING, a high number of users sharing parking zones but you will be able to use the functionalities to find your car automatically without having to do anything, as well as all those events from your city or outside being shared by the rest of the users.</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to use the application on my Smartphone without having the device CookieNAV?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. However, you will not be able to share your parking place automatically with the rest of the users so it would not be fair that you had the same opportunities than those who have a CookieNAV and share their parking places. If you only have the application you will continue receiving the location of other users’ parking places not in real time but with a delay of 30 to 45 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Is the application free?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. For all the users that have a device CookieNAV.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any kind of monthly or yearly subscription to CookieNAV?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NO</strong>. once you receive your CookieNAV you will not have to pay any kind of maintenance fee.</p>
<p><strong>Can i place CookieNAV in any part of my car?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NO</strong>. Our recomendation is to place it on the dashboard of your car since it is very important that CookieNAV is located on a surface perfectly stuck to it in order to allow its accelerometer to detect when your car is moving. Imagine you place CookieNAV on the door, every time you open or close it you would be informing the community that your car is moving when it is not.</p>
<p><strong>How will the company be supported in the future if CookNAV is that cheap?</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to reach to the biggest possible number of users and the best way to do it is by reducing to the maximum the cost of the device. The higher the number of users the easier it will be to find a parking place in big cities and to reduce to the maximum the impact generated by big traffic jams during the morning peak hour in every city around the world.<br/>The funding will be supported by using non-invasive advertisement on the mobile application. Thus, we can offer a great product full of technology at an affordable price.</p>

<p><strong><img alt=""trash"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.abiie.com/images/indiegogo/trash.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 440px; height: 238px;"" title=""trash""/></strong></p>
<p>One of the key problems with today’s baby products is that most of the baby products have a short life span; as soon as the child outgrows its use, the product becomes a useless item, occupying space and often times on its way to a garage sale, craigslist, or trash can. We want parents to be able to use a product that is not only user-friendly and comfortable to the child, but at the same time helps parents <strong>saving</strong>. <br/>On top of that, many baby products are made of non-eco-friendly material, like plastic or metals. In contrast, the Y chair is made of beech wood, which is <strong>biodegradable</strong> and <strong>recyclable</strong>, and also a more durable material – when properly cared for, beech wood furniture can last for several years.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Eco-Friendly Matters to Everyone?</strong></h3>
<p><img alt=""ecofriendly "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.abiie.com/images/indiegogo/sustain_forest_management3.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 636px; height: 220px;"" title=""ecofriendly ""/></p>
<p>For us, the environment matters. When it comes to choosing the material for the baby chair, we select the beech wood that comes from a cultivated forest in Europe. Now what does that mean? It means that our selection of material is a renewable, abundant, and sustainable solution as for <strong>every beech tree that is harvested, several trees are planted</strong>. Sustainable forestry practices encourage and promote the natural life cycle to preserve our natural resources for future generations and keep our planet green and healthy.</p>
<h3><strong>Is It Safe?</strong></h3>
<p>Safety is always our top priority and strict measurement guidelines are implemented from creating the design and through all the production phases. The Beyond high chair meets &amp; complies with US ASTM F404-07 standards and contains no harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalate, and PVC.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Honeybee Hive is a WiFi router that gives you a full cloud platform for your home or small business. </p>
<p>Due to its place on your network it can provide unique services such as pro-active security, personal cloud storage available to you anywhere, and a streaming media server available to any connected device. Honeybee would be able to store encrypted copies of your data on other Honeybee devices as close as possible to you. Keeping multiple copies ensures the data won't be lost and the locality means accessing your cloud is faster.</p>
<p>Businesses would be able to develop apps for the Honeybee device and could pay to use storage space on the Honeybee cloud. Locality and replication are important aspects of content delivery networks used by tech companies like Netflix and Google. They distribute copies of their shows or websites as closely as they can to people likely to want those copies. Companies could use their existing analytics about where their viewers live to distribute copies physically close to them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $600 to develop a physical prototype to show to investors. Having an actual device to show to investors will give us a huge leg up.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The need for cloud computing and storage is skyrocketing. The Honeybee network can solve this.</p>
<p>There are about 53 million WiFi routers in America. If 2% of those routers were Honeybees with a 1TB SSD drive we could provide up to 1 million terabytes of cloud storage.

<p>That’s us, Dan and Alex, the dynamic duo behind Kleverness, and we’re two extremely ambitious entrepreneurs with a passion for technology and design. For a while now, we’ve been trying to find a home automation lighting system for our own homes that has all of the functionality we’ve been searching for. When we couldn’t find it, we took it upon ourselves to create our own version that provided the same functionality as the competition, without the need for a neutral wire. With the right team in place, we were able to create a design, build an app and put everything in place to automate your home’s lighting easily and efficiently, but now we need your help. From the Kleverness family to yours, we thank you for your support!    </p>

</div></div>","Did you know that most people who want to automate their home start with lighting? So why aren’t smart switches and dimmers more affordable, more accessible, and more importantly, why don’t they work better?We took a look at every smart switch and dimmer on the market, evaluated them, and made sure our products covered more than just the basics, and performed better overall for a better price.     1. Determine how many rooms you want to make smart.2. Calculate how many outlets and/or switches you need per room.3. Click “Back this project”4. Select the ""Choose Your Early Bird + Klever Hub"" reward for the best price5. Add on however many switches and/or outlets you calculated ($49 per additional switch and $35 per additional outlet). Don't worry about picking colors just yet. At the end of the campaign, you will receive a survey where you will pick colors and tell us if you want dimmers or switches.    The Klever Switch & Dimmer allow you to seamlessly transform your entire home into a Klever home within a matter of minutes. No modifications. No neutral wiring. No special bulbs. You’ll be able to control your home’s lighting from anywhere in the world using your phone, smartwatch, tablet, desktop, or laptop as long as you have an internet connection.          You’ll be able to control every Klever Switch and Dimmer using the Kleverness app, whether that’s turning the lights on, turning them off, setting a schedule or setting the mood.  Using the Kleverness app, you can set schedules and manage routines. Make sure your bedroom light turns on at 7:00 A.M. during the week and that the kitchen lights follow shortly after. Give your kids a hard stop with lights off at 9:30 P.M. on school nights and a little later on the weekends. The possibilities are truly endless. Even if your phone isn’t connected, your routines will continue to work. Klever products also have the ability to sync with the sunrise and sunset based on your location.    Using geofencing technology, you can turn your lights on and off automatically as you come and go without ever having to take your phone out of your pocket. It’s the perfect way to make sure all of the lights are turned off when you leave, which can save you money in the long run on your energy bills.   With the Klever Switch, you can monitor the energy consumption of each individual switch and learn what you can use less of to save more money on your next energy bill. You can also set up notifications for daily, monthly and yearly energy consumption reports. Got an old bulb that’s drawing a lot of energy? Kleverness will let you know that it’s time to replace it! If you’re really looking to save, you can dim your lights by hand or by phone with the Klever Dimmer to draw less power, extend the bulb life, save energy and save money at the same time.  Each Klever Switch and Dimmer is a radio frequency repeater, which means that it works in the farthest corners of your house, no matter how far away they are from the hub. No Bluetooth. No WiFi. Just a simple internet connection. Each Switch and Dimmer has a 45-meter radius and each Klever Hub can support up to 512 devices, so you’ll only ever need one.   Klever Switches and Dimmers use AI technology to learn and mimic your schedule while you’re away to make your home appear occupied. You can also set your own custom schedule while you’re away in the Kleverness app. Potential intruders won’t even know you’re gone!  Kleverness supports unlimited users per household, so everyone can be in charge. Whether you rent out your home on Airbnb, struggle with a roommate who leaves every light on, or have a little one who refuses to turn off the lights, you can easily manage and customize Klever permissions directly from your phone.   Set the sleep function through the Kleverness app so that your Switch and Dimmer’s LED lighting will completely turn off when you’ve been inactive or once your schedule says you’re asleep. Need to get up for a trip to the bathroom or kitchen for a midnight snack? Once you’re near the Switch or Dimmer, the proximity sensor will make the LED lights turn back on for your convenience.Paired switches (When the same light is controlled by more that one switch). Klever switches are perfectly compatible with this kind of installation and will work seamlessly.            With the Kleverness app, you’ll be able to limit connectivity to your home’s network or enable access from anywhere that there’s WiFi. Your security means the world to us, which is why the Kleverness app will only connect to your Klever Hub using secure, encrypted access.       Whether you’re switching apartments or making the move to a new home, Klever Switches and Dimmers go where you go. Just remove the Klever products you’ve installed, pack them up, put the old switch plates back on, and get moving! Installing and uninstalling our switches and dimmers is easy, intuitive and can be done within a matter of minutes.       *Additional shipping charges may apply

Making it a sizeable and practical length. </p><p>The Monkey Grip tape can hold up to 1 KG / 2.2 LB on any smooth clean surface. But we do recommend that you test the surface and weight of the item before affixing anything heavy to a wall or surface. Like with any adhesive, Monkey Grip cannot bond well with dirt, dust, moisture or porous surfaces. So be sure that the surface and object are clean, non-porous and dirt and dust free for the best results! </p><h2>OUR FORMULA:</h2><p>The Gel formula we have created for Monkey Grip is a unique blend of Polyurethane Elastomer made by a specific reaction between the Prepolymer and Curative. When working with this type of material there are 5 variables that when each react a certain way, create a unique result. This is the reason that Gel products have such a wide range of uses, some are used in Bras and Shoes, they are not sticky at all, but still have a gel consistency. While some gel products have the same consistency while they also hold adhesive properties strong enough to be used in automobile manufacturing. </p><p>The Manufacturing process we use to make the Monkey Grip formula is as follows and some of you may have heard of it before. In it's most basic terminology it can be described as an A / B reaction formula. The Prepolymer material (the 'A') and what is called the Curative (the 'B') come together and depending of the 5 variables, amount of A, amount of B, temperature of mould plate, substrate temperature (the temperature of A and B) and timing of mixture, we can see different results and a vastly different product. The prepolymer consists of an isocyanate (or an NCO) that reacts with the hydroxyl (OH) in the curative, which creates the adhesive qualities depending on the above variables. All the five variables, were tested in over 55 combinations to finally come to the current formula we now use for The Monkey Grip. The Monkey Grip formula takes all these variables into account to create a 'upper middle ground' gel pad. The end result is a Gel Pad that has a strong core, making it durable, while having a high amount of adhesive properties but not so much that will rip paint off or damage walls. By applying particular quantities of the prepolymer and the curative at varying temperatures, we found many different styles of gel pad could be made at various levels of adhesive and so through much testing, we found a result we were happy with.</p><p>We are currently working with Patent lawyers to patent our particular formula and manufacturing methods. However, we have found that chemical patents are expensive to process and often times difficult and also expensive to enforce. So we are still looking into channels for a chemical patent, while also looking into other forms of patent such as manufacturing styles. </p><h2>Prototypes and Design Process: </h2><p>As mentioned above, we use an A/B curing method to create our own formula for Monkey Grip. To create Monkey Grip Tape we cure our A/B formula on large plates, these plates are 5m x 1m. But can be 5m x 2-3m. This means that once our A/B formula has cured and everything has set, Monkey Grip Tape is rolled up into large rolls 1 - 3m long. They are then precision cut to into 3cm widths which make up our Monkey Grip Tape! </p><p>Our very first tests and our very first prototype and manufacturing test was white! The Monkey Grip Tape formula originally performed best when it reacted and cured with a dye that we added to the mix. We later found that this in fact was unreliable and being white, obviously, would lose it's color and get very dirty very quickly. </p><p>After some time, tests, 34 prototypes and a trip to Dongguan, China to meet 'Woods', our Manufacturing Manager at the factory we have partnered with, we came to the realisation that the white style was not suitable. As mentioned earlier. This is when we began testing the 'Clear' style and immediately had better and more reliable results.</p><p>Our first 'clear' style formula prototype was a great leap forward. However we did not like the use of the white outer protective sheeting. So we started making our prototypes with a clear removable protective film, as you can see below. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528780948/w2uyyiboo3jajpx6kt2o.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Our second clear prototype was slightly wider than our current 3cm Monkey Grip Tape and measure in at 4cm wide and 4mm thick. We had a great result with this, but it made the roll and tape too bulky. As you can see in the above image! </p><p>As we had now decided on the clear gel formula and it's results we're, overall, much better that the white, the next step was to decide on the exact thickness, width and length of Monkey Grip. While all along we had wanted to create a roll of Gel Adhesive tape, we toyed with the idea of making long strips as well, but this only survived one prototype test as none of us liked it and it was impractical for shipping and storage. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528781110/rbh80ow8kplb0xykjlcs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>As you can see above, we tested the strips in different sizes and lengths but we decided against this very quickly and went back to the idea of the Roll. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528781133/ws1obuz5o3mwbq1q7myk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Now that we had decided on the rolls, at 3 cm wide, and 3mm thick, we needed to do some more tests with some more prototypes to discover the perfect length.

Vacuuming the car’s surface, floor, seats as well as interior is essential to keep out the debris, dirt, dust and other particles that can damage the car components in the long run. It is also critical for maintaining a healthier driver and passenger environment especially for those with pulmonary and skin diseases.Introducing Dokiy, the cordless handheld car vacuum cleaner that comes with 16000PA strong suction, stainless steel & HEPA dual filters and 3 nozzles to have your car, desktop and hard-to-reach corners cleaning covered.Dokiy handheld vacuum cleaner is small in size, only 11.6”*2.2” (height*diameter) and ultra-light in weight of only 500g / 1.1lb. The compact design, lightweight, cordless design makes it a breeze to pick up and clean immediately. Say goodbye to bulky cleaners.Dokiy has the greatest power-to-size ratio. Its suction power is anything but little. It offers 2 levels of suction power:
Auto Level One 6000PA: is ideal for quick debris cleaning. The battery run time in this level is 38 minutes once you fully charge it.
Level Two 16000PA is by day the most powerful on handheld cleaner to cover a wide range of scenarios: no matter pet hair, cat litter, dust particles, crumbs, microparticles, pollen, soot, or even fluid. The battery run time at its full power in this level is 9 minutes once you fully charge it.
This handheld vacuum has a 85,000 RPM brushless digital motor and offers 16,000 Pascals of suction power. With the powerful 120watt motor, Dokiy offers very strong suction for difficult particles in hard-to-reach areas and makes car interior cleaning super easy.In addition to its compact size that fits just right into your palm, Dokiy has an ergonomic design that offers comfortable anti-slippery grip, making it the handiest vacuum cleaner to date.To craft the function and design matching product, we have adopted the straightforward duct, letting the air flow pass directly without obstruction so that it makes less noise and offers great suction performance.Dokiy is built with HEPA filter which is exquisite crafted with long durability and can be washed for much more time than paper filters. The HEPA filtrates fine dust and allergens. It is fairly easy to clean, and you don’t have to frequently purchase replacements.The HEPA filter is joined by a stainless steel pre-filter for catching larger particles like debris and pet hair. Both of the filters are washable. You may simply take them out and rinse them when it is necessary.It comes equipped with three different cleaning attachments: a crevice nozzle for narrow gaps, corners and liquids, a brush tool for carpets and upholstery, and a long soft pipe for vacuuming dust particles flexibly. These are extension attachments that our designers came up with aiming to have your various scenarios covered.Almost every corner of your car can be cleaned effortlessly. Moreover, it helps you clean the dust in sofas, walls, crumbs on desktop, debris at stairs and other hard-to-reach corners with these three attachments.Dokiy’s detachable dust cup head is good for quick and easy trash dumping, and you’re ready right away to continue the rest of your cleaning. We have designed a tiny slide lock at the side to prevent the cup from falling accidently while the device is working.The cup is transparent and 100% visible for you to keep an eye on its remaining capacity. Simply pull down to unlock and let the dirt cup bounce up. You’ll never have to worry about dirty hands when taking up the cup.The powerful and durable motor rotates at a max speed of 85000 PM per/min, reducing the noise level to 75 dB and increasing the suction of the vacuum to 6000 PA. You don’t have to worry about waking up the baby or scaring the dog because of the too noisy motor. Additionally, since Dokiy is equipped with only one button to power on and operate, it is quite intuitive and easy to use. It is just press and play.The brushless has 3x 2000mAh batteries, providing 2 levels of powers: general suction power at 800 PA and enhanced power at 16,000 PA, making the continuous working time for the levels separately around 38 minutes and 9 minutes, which highly improves efficiency, performs much better and works longer.Every detail counts. Ranging from the aluminum exterior shell which is solid and durable, to the stainless steel & HEPA dual filters, duct system, replaceable nozzle attachments for different occasions, lockable dust cup, ergonomic design and its extreme power-to-size ratio, we care about how the product looks and how well it serves. And throughout numerous times of testing and experiments, we have proved that Dokiy can work for 20,000 cycles and that means you may use it at least 5 years.We are a team called Urlife.

With Neabot, it makes it possible for you to schedule your cleaning and let it do the rest without any intervention even for weeks.                   For years of evolution, floor vacuuming with the robot still remains little more than a tedious housework for us. Poor navigation, inadequate delivery. Not to speak of the inconvenience of emptying and cleaning the dustbin for it. Very frustrating!  Thankfully, Neabot is here to make your life easier. Neabot can empty its dustbin and resume the cleaning task automatically without you interacting with them. So you can forget about the cleaning chores for weeks and focus on other productivity tasks. Product Review by SupraPixel      Automatic Dirt Collecting & DisposalForget about vacuuming for upto a month with Neabot self-emptying dustbin. Neabot automatically transfers the dirt collected from the robot into the bag-lined dustbin without you having to touch the mess.  Set it and forget it! The Auto-sealed dust bag holds 2 to 4 weeks of dirt and debris for easy disposal without the cloud of dust.   Strong Suction with 2700PaNeabot can easily carry out more heavy cleaning tasks with its unbeatable suction power of 2700Pa. Two side brushes and a roller brush effectively loosen, extract, and vacuum dirt to give a superior clean. Multi-Level Vacuuming ModesUtilized 3 levels of suction power including Small, Regular, and Strong modes, Neabot easily tackles any mess whether for regular or deeper cleaning.  Deeper Carpet CleaningNeabot comes with smart carpet identification that recognizes carpet flooring and automatically boosts the suction for extracting pet hair and other debris from carpet fibers. And it can climb across thresholds of up to 2cm in height with ease.  One Charge, 200m² of CleaningWith a large battery capacity of 5200mAh, Neabot cleans upto 3.5 hours per charge for a space of about 200m²(2150 ft²).    Smart Route Planning & Customizable Cleaning StrategyNeabot can learn the environment and figure out an optimized cleaning routine. The technologies of Lidar Navigation and the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) literally make Neabot smarter than ever.  Neabot uses a z-shaped vacuuming pattern, instead of just randomly traveling around, which tends to be a more efficient way to clean.  Once the map is saved, you can ask Neabot to clean the rooms that you want it to and set the daily cleaning strategy as you wish.  Zone Cleaning & No-go Zone & Scheduled CleaningWith the Neabot APP, you can adjust cleaning settings, customize the cleaning strategy, and monitor the cleaning status and more no matter where you are.   With a room map saved, you can tell the robot to clean only certain parts of the room and to stay out of others. Simply drag the bounding box to the area you want cleaned, it's done.  You can also place virtual ""no-go"" zones from within the app, sectioning off any particular areas or boundaries to prevent your robot from going there.  Neabot allows users to schedule a specific room to be cleaned at different times and on different dates, providing truly convenient and effortless home cleaning.     You can direct the robot to clean any exact spot you want it to clean and it will clean the localized area of 5*5 ft (1.6*1.6 m) around it.    Bumper & Cliff Sensors & Wall Sensors And MoreWhat makes a robot cleaner robotic is the precision of the navigation sensors. With multiple smart sensors, Neabot avoids obstacles with ease and tackles tough terrain effortlessly.  When Neabot knocks into something, its bumper retracts and the sensors tell the robot to find a clear path.  The cliff sensors help Neabot sense the edges and avoid it falling from heights.  The wall sensors let Neabot follow very closely along walls and around objects without touching them.     When the battery starts to run out of juice the vacuum will return automatically to its charging base.     After a constant effort of 2 years, we have finally brought the idea of  Neabot to life.

<h2 style=""font-family: 'Antenna Cond Black','Helvetica','sans-serif';"">About WeatherFlow</h2>
<a href=""http://www.weatherflow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WeatherFlow</a> is a team of over 30 meteorologists, engineers, programmers, and data scientists. Back in the late 90s, we realized that although weather is everywhere, good weather stations with <a href=""http://www.weatherflow.com/data-and-application/weatherflow-datascope/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">accurate reliable data</a> are not. In fact, in many areas, The Weather comes from National Weather Service stations installed in the 70s at a nearby airport, or worse, from a poorly sited station reporting inaccurate data.<p>So, we set out to identify strategic areas lacking good weather data. In order to fulfill our mission, we ended up installing one of the largest, private, high-quality <a href=""http://www.weatherflow.com/coastal-weather-networks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">weather networks</a> in the world. Then we combined the unique data from this network with a carefully curated set of trusted weather data to dramatically improve forecast accuracy and provide hyper-local observations in key areas across the US. We got so good at it that agencies such as the Department of Defense and the <a href=""http://www.weatherflow.com/about-us/clients-and-partners/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Hurricane Center</a> came calling on our expertise. For over two decades we’ve provided increasingly <a href=""http://www.weatherflow.com/data-and-application/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">better weather data</a> so that our customers can make better decisions, saving them time and money, and increasing safety.</p>
<p>Nowadays everyone seems to have a weather app on their smartphones. But we continue to see massive discrepancies between The Weather and Your Weather - the conditions in your own backyard that affect you directly. With advances in smart home technology, environmental monitoring, and automation in commercial areas such as agriculture, we recognized a greater need for quality weather data everywhere.</p> <h2 style=""font-family: 'Antenna Cond Black','Helvetica','sans-serif';"">The WeatherFlow Team</h2>

<br/><br/>FAQ's</h2>
<h3>PRODUCT FEATURES</h3>
<h4>How accurate are the sensors?</h4>
<p>We're all about good data....because let's face it, bad data is misleading. That's why we have spent considerable effort sourcing and testing high-quality sensors for every device we produce. Combined with innovative technologies like our proprietary sonic anemometer and haptic rain sensor, our devices are every bit as accurate as scientific weather stations that cost 3X the price. See our sensor specs further down this page.</p>
<h4>Why do I need a weather station at my house?</h4>
<p>You might not realize this, but most weather apps and even your evening news is based on public domain data -- primarily on weather stations installed long ago at regional airports. Having a reliable weather station at your house can help you save money on heating &amp; air conditioning based on the true environmental dynamics of your house, tell you exactly what's happening in your backyard (not the nearest airport), and allow you to make automated decision with your smart home systems.</p>
<h4>Totally wireless?</h4>
<p>Yes. Both the AIR and the SKY are battery powered and communicate to our hub via long range radio telemetry. The typical range is up to 1000ft (300m) depending on situation, and blockages like cement walls, etc. </p>
<h4>Portable?</h4>
<p>Yes. Go ahead, bring the AIR to the soccer game and detect lightning before it gets to you. Or place the SKY on your boat or at the beach to measure wind, rain, and solar radiation. The device can communicate with the hub plugged into a common USB power bank, then it will communicate to your connected mobile device and send the data to the cloud for instant viewing online.</p>
<h4>Do I need to download the app to use the WeatherFlow devices?</h4>
<p>Yes, the WeatherFlow app is required to setup and configure the smart weather devices. The app also serves as your daily weather data viewer. Once set up, you can also view your data through or web app, as well as other integrated weather apps such as Weather Underground Personal Weather Station.</p>
<h4>Is the WeatherFlow mobile app free?</h4>
<p>Absolutely! Available on iOS or Android now: search for ""WeatherFlow Smart Weather""in your app store. Note: no Amazon app as Amazon does not allow publication of apps that run Google services.</p>
<h4>Can I use my iPad?</h4>
<p>You can use any connected device to view your weather data. iPad - yes. iPhone - yes. Android phone or tablet - yes. Computer - yes. Anything with a browser.</p>
<h4>Will the devices work with any Smartphone or tablet?</h4>
<p>Most of them. WeatherFlow devices are compatible with all iOS and Android 4.3+ devices with Bluetooth Low Energy support for direct connection to the devices. If the device is connected to your home WiFi network, your data is pushed automatically to the cloud. Then anyone / any connected device can view the data via the WeatherFlow app or a variety of integrated weather and smart home apps.</p>
<h4>Why did you separate a weather station into two devices?</h4>
<p>Better siting, better data. In order to accurately measure wind, rain, and UV you need to place the SKY in an open area with a clear view of the sky above (like on your roof). As you can imagine, placing a temperature sensor in the full sun presents issues. That's why we made the AIR a separate device to be placed in the shade -- more accurate data.</p>
<h4>What if I don't have a shady spot for the AIR?</h4>
<p>No problem. There are off-the-shelf radiation shields that you can purchase and place the AIR inside. Search ""radiation shield"" on Amazon. We suggest the Ambient SRS100LX which fits the AIR snuggly.</p>
<h4>What size pole do I need to mount the SKY?</h4>
<p>The SKY is designed to fit on top of a pole with an outer diameter of 1.25 inches or 1.32 inches (31.75mm or 33.53 mm). The specific standard is known as ""NPS 1"" in the US (and Canada?) or ""NB 1"" in the UK. In most of the rest of the world it's also known as ""DN 25"". It should be a very common pole size everywhere. In the US it's sold at DIY stores in various materials-if you ask for a ""one inch"" pole</p>
<h4>Will they work with Weather Underground?</h4>
<p>Yes. You can publish your weather station data directly to Weather Underground. We'll walk you through the WU set up in our app.</p>
<h4>When will the BREATHE be available?</h4>
<p>We hope to release the  WeatherFlow BREATHE in 2018. The BREATHE and can be added to your network with the same WeatherFlow hub and apps.</p>
<h4>What does the BREATHE device do?</h4>
<p>BREATHE will measure total indoor air quality including VOCs, CO2, Dust particles, Humidity, and Temperature. It's designed to monitor the air inside your house and allow you to automatically trigger smart home actions such as: turn on air purifiers, open the windows, tune heating and cooling, ventilate bad air, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>TECHNICAL QUESTIONS</h3>
<h4>How does the sonic anemometer work?</h4>
<p>SKY houses a sonic anemometer in the top of the device. The SKY measures wind speed and direction based on the time of flight of sonic pulses between pairs of transducers. This allows for a high degree of accuracy especially in variable wind conditions.  For more information see Wikipedia on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemometer#Sonic_anemometers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sonic Anemometers</a>.</p>
<h4>What is the report interval for the wind sensor?</h4>
<p>Good question! Wind speed and direction are sampled once per second. This one second reading is broadcast locally via BLE or UDP, which means within range (up to 300 feet line-of-sight) you will be able to see those rapid updates on a smart phone or BlueTooth-enabled tablet. Additionally, these one second samples are averaged on a configurable schedule (1 min, 5 min, 15 min, etc.) and viewable both locally and remotely via our app and website (or third party apps like WUnderstation from Weather Underground). We are also working on a way to see the more frequent updates remotely. Reporting intervals are a balancing act with power consumption. Each time the device 'wakes up' and reports via WiFi it uses power. So, more frequent intervals = less battery life. And visa versa.</p>
<h4>Can I use this on a boat or other moving object?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. Although not specifically designed for a boat, they are very portable and will send data to your phone or tablet even if you're not connected to the Internet. Note: the station is designed for stationary home use and thus does not contain GPS technology to things like apparent wind speed on a moving boat. </p>
<h4>How do I store and access data? What if I don't have internet access?</h4>
<p>Normally, your smart weather station will collect and send data to our servers. You can access this data through our app or our website, and you can export it in a variety of ways. But your stations will also collect and store some data even when they are not connected to the Internet! First, the devices themselves will store many days of data if left alone. Then, as soon as you're within range of a station, just start up the app and the data will be pulled in. From there, you can view or export it as usual.</p>
<h4>How does the haptic rain sensor work?</h4>
<p>SKY uses a patent-pending haptic rain sensor in the top of the device. Using a combination of pressure and capacitance, SKY measures and counts each falling raindrop. Algorithms exclude things that are not rain (like the rumblings of a passing train or Harley). This allows SKY to report the instant rain begins falling, the current intensity, and the total rain accumulation over time.  Accuracy compares to a large tipping bucket, but does not get fouled with leafs or bird crap. </p>
<h4>Does the AIR really detect lightning?</h4>
<p>Yup. Pretty cool, huh?  The AIR actually detects cloud-to-ground AND cloud-to-cloud activity. Our sensor detects electrical transmissions from lightning activity up to 40km (approx. 25 miles) away and gives an estimate of distance. Humans can typically sense lightning only up to 25km away. The sensor algorithm is even smart enough to reject man-made signals such as microwave ovens and motors.  That said, it's important to place the AIR away from electrical disturbances for best performance. So ya, AIR can alert you when lightning is approaching way before you can hear or see it.</p>

<h4>Do the devices need to be calibrated?</h4>
<p>No. Each sensor will be first pre-calibrated by the sensor manufacturer and then will go through calibration procedure on our production line to ensure accuracy.</p>
<h4>How long will the battery last?</h4>
<p>Our hardware and firmware engineers have spent months optimizing the smallest of details to ensure efficient low power consumption.  We recommend using long-lasting, primary lithium batteries, which perform better in extreme temperatures than alkaline. According to our power consumption calculations, we expect your batteries to last at least one year under normal usage conditions before needing replacement. Your mileage may vary based on how you configure your station.</p>
<h4>Are the batteries replaceable?</h4>
<p>Yes. The sealed battery compartment is accessible via the twist-off base. You can replace the batteries with common lithium AA batteries available everywhere. We recommend the Energizer ""Ultimate Lithium"" batteries or similar. The AIR takes 4 AA lithium batteries. The SKY takes 8 AA lithium batteries. </p>
<h4>What smart home platform will the devices work with?</h4>
<p>We are currently working on integrations with SmartThings, NEST, Apple HomeKit, Amazon Echo, and IFTTT. The IFTTT platform enables integration with thousands of connected devices. We intend to continue to build meaningful integrations with as many smart platforms as make sense.</p>

About WeatherFlow
WeatherFlow is a team of over 30 meteorologists, engineers, programmers, and data scientists. Back in the late 90s, we realized that although weather is everywhere, good weather stations with accurate reliable data are not. In fact, in many areas, The Weather comes from National Weather Service stations installed in the 70s at a nearby airport, or worse, from a poorly sited station reporting inaccurate data.So, we set out to identify strategic areas lacking good weather data. In order to fulfill our mission, we ended up installing one of the largest, private, high-quality weather networks in the world. Then we combined the unique data from this network with a carefully curated set of trusted weather data to dramatically improve forecast accuracy and provide hyper-local observations in key areas across the US. We got so good at it that agencies such as the Department of Defense and the National Hurricane Center came calling on our expertise. For over two decades we’ve provided increasingly better weather data so that our customers can make better decisions, saving them time and money, and increasing safety.
Nowadays everyone seems to have a weather app on their smartphones. But we continue to see massive discrepancies between The Weather and Your Weather - the conditions in your own backyard that affect you directly. With advances in smart home technology, environmental monitoring, and automation in commercial areas such as agriculture, we recognized a greater need for quality weather data everywhere. The WeatherFlow Team

FAQ's
PRODUCT FEATURES
How accurate are the sensors?
We're all about good data....because let's face it, bad data is misleading. That's why we have spent considerable effort sourcing and testing high-quality sensors for every device we produce. Combined with innovative technologies like our proprietary sonic anemometer and haptic rain sensor, our devices are every bit as accurate as scientific weather stations that cost 3X the price. See our sensor specs further down this page.
Why do I need a weather station at my house?
You might not realize this, but most weather apps and even your evening news is based on public domain data -- primarily on weather stations installed long ago at regional airports. Having a reliable weather station at your house can help you save money on heating & air conditioning based on the true environmental dynamics of your house, tell you exactly what's happening in your backyard (not the nearest airport), and allow you to make automated decision with your smart home systems.
Totally wireless?
Yes. Both the AIR and the SKY are battery powered and communicate to our hub via long range radio telemetry. The typical range is up to 1000ft (300m) depending on situation, and blockages like cement walls, etc. 
Portable?
Yes. Go ahead, bring the AIR to the soccer game and detect lightning before it gets to you. Or place the SKY on your boat or at the beach to measure wind, rain, and solar radiation. The device can communicate with the hub plugged into a common USB power bank, then it will communicate to your connected mobile device and send the data to the cloud for instant viewing online.
Do I need to download the app to use the WeatherFlow devices?
Yes, the WeatherFlow app is required to setup and configure the smart weather devices. The app also serves as your daily weather data viewer. Once set up, you can also view your data through or web app, as well as other integrated weather apps such as Weather Underground Personal Weather Station.
Is the WeatherFlow mobile app free?
Absolutely! Available on iOS or Android now: search for ""WeatherFlow Smart Weather""in your app store. Note: no Amazon app as Amazon does not allow publication of apps that run Google services.
Can I use my iPad?
You can use any connected device to view your weather data. iPad - yes. iPhone - yes. Android phone or tablet - yes. Computer - yes. Anything with a browser.
Will the devices work with any Smartphone or tablet?
Most of them. WeatherFlow devices are compatible with all iOS and Android 4.3+ devices with Bluetooth Low Energy support for direct connection to the devices. If the device is connected to your home WiFi network, your data is pushed automatically to the cloud. Then anyone / any connected device can view the data via the WeatherFlow app or a variety of integrated weather and smart home apps.
Why did you separate a weather station into two devices?
Better siting, better data. In order to accurately measure wind, rain, and UV you need to place the SKY in an open area with a clear view of the sky above (like on your roof). As you can imagine, placing a temperature sensor in the full sun presents issues. That's why we made the AIR a separate device to be placed in the shade -- more accurate data.
What if I don't have a shady spot for the AIR?
No problem. There are off-the-shelf radiation shields that you can purchase and place the AIR inside. Search ""radiation shield"" on Amazon. We suggest the Ambient SRS100LX which fits the AIR snuggly.
What size pole do I need to mount the SKY?
The SKY is designed to fit on top of a pole with an outer diameter of 1.25 inches or 1.32 inches (31.75mm or 33.53 mm). The specific standard is known as ""NPS 1"" in the US (and Canada?) or ""NB 1"" in the UK. In most of the rest of the world it's also known as ""DN 25"". It should be a very common pole size everywhere. In the US it's sold at DIY stores in various materials-if you ask for a ""one inch"" pole
Will they work with Weather Underground?
Yes. You can publish your weather station data directly to Weather Underground. We'll walk you through the WU set up in our app.
When will the BREATHE be available?
We hope to release the  WeatherFlow BREATHE in 2018. The BREATHE and can be added to your network with the same WeatherFlow hub and apps.
What does the BREATHE device do?
BREATHE will measure total indoor air quality including VOCs, CO2, Dust particles, Humidity, and Temperature. It's designed to monitor the air inside your house and allow you to automatically trigger smart home actions such as: turn on air purifiers, open the windows, tune heating and cooling, ventilate bad air, etc.
 
 
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
How does the sonic anemometer work?
SKY houses a sonic anemometer in the top of the device. The SKY measures wind speed and direction based on the time of flight of sonic pulses between pairs of transducers. This allows for a high degree of accuracy especially in variable wind conditions.  For more information see Wikipedia on Sonic Anemometers.
What is the report interval for the wind sensor?
Good question! Wind speed and direction are sampled once per second. This one second reading is broadcast locally via BLE or UDP, which means within range (up to 300 feet line-of-sight) you will be able to see those rapid updates on a smart phone or BlueTooth-enabled tablet. Additionally, these one second samples are averaged on a configurable schedule (1 min, 5 min, 15 min, etc.) and viewable both locally and remotely via our app and website (or third party apps like WUnderstation from Weather Underground). We are also working on a way to see the more frequent updates remotely. Reporting intervals are a balancing act with power consumption. Each time the device 'wakes up' and reports via WiFi it uses power. So, more frequent intervals = less battery life. And visa versa.
Can I use this on a boat or other moving object?
Absolutely. Although not specifically designed for a boat, they are very portable and will send data to your phone or tablet even if you're not connected to the Internet. Note: the station is designed for stationary home use and thus does not contain GPS technology to things like apparent wind speed on a moving boat. 
How do I store and access data? What if I don't have internet access?
Normally, your smart weather station will collect and send data to our servers. You can access this data through our app or our website, and you can export it in a variety of ways. But your stations will also collect and store some data even when they are not connected to the Internet! First, the devices themselves will store many days of data if left alone. Then, as soon as you're within range of a station, just start up the app and the data will be pulled in. From there, you can view or export it as usual.
How does the haptic rain sensor work?
SKY uses a patent-pending haptic rain sensor in the top of the device. Using a combination of pressure and capacitance, SKY measures and counts each falling raindrop. Algorithms exclude things that are not rain (like the rumblings of a passing train or Harley). This allows SKY to report the instant rain begins falling, the current intensity, and the total rain accumulation over time.  Accuracy compares to a large tipping bucket, but does not get fouled with leafs or bird crap. 
Does the AIR really detect lightning?
Yup. Pretty cool, huh?  The AIR actually detects cloud-to-ground AND cloud-to-cloud activity. Our sensor detects electrical transmissions from lightning activity up to 40km (approx. 25 miles) away and gives an estimate of distance. Humans can typically sense lightning only up to 25km away. The sensor algorithm is even smart enough to reject man-made signals such as microwave ovens and motors.  That said, it's important to place the AIR away from electrical disturbances for best performance. So ya, AIR can alert you when lightning is approaching way before you can hear or see it.

Do the devices need to be calibrated?
No. Each sensor will be first pre-calibrated by the sensor manufacturer and then will go through calibration procedure on our production line to ensure accuracy.
How long will the battery last?
Our hardware and firmware engineers have spent months optimizing the smallest of details to ensure efficient low power consumption.  We recommend using long-lasting, primary lithium batteries, which perform better in extreme temperatures than alkaline. According to our power consumption calculations, we expect your batteries to last at least one year under normal usage conditions before needing replacement. Your mileage may vary based on how you configure your station.
Are the batteries replaceable?
Yes. The sealed battery compartment is accessible via the twist-off base. You can replace the batteries with common lithium AA batteries available everywhere. We recommend the Energizer ""Ultimate Lithium"" batteries or similar. The AIR takes 4 AA lithium batteries. The SKY takes 8 AA lithium batteries. 
What smart home platform will the devices work with?
We are currently working on integrations with SmartThings, NEST, Apple HomeKit, Amazon Echo, and IFTTT. The IFTTT platform enables integration with thousands of connected devices. We intend to continue to build meaningful integrations with as many smart platforms as make sense.

We are focused on PRACTICAL TRICKS
The company was established in 2010 by two friends, Petar Zaharinov - the designer of the products and Delyan Spasov - the webmaster and manager. Since the beginning we have been functioning as a boutique brand that sells its products mainly through its own website, but we are sure that we can have much bigger coverage!



All designs are inspired by interlocking burr puzzles. They are flat pack and require no fixtures and no tools. They are made of natural and traditional materials. They are interactive and stimulate the intelligence and the dexterity of the user. They are fun!

By reaching our funding goal we will be able to do the following:

Design and prototype a special collection for children. We have worked on several projects dedicated to kids which convinced us that the interactive and cognitive nature of our designs is appropriate for them.



Reduce the prices of the most popular products on our website by at least 15% and shorten the lead time considerably. We will be able to manufacture and keep in stock larger quantities.



Find reliable distributors worldwide by participating in major furniture Expos in US, UK, EU, Japan etc. Participating in Trade Shows is essential in furniture sector because of the material nature of the products.

sliding collection



impossible collection



coordinate collection



Some burr puzzle structures are extremely simple and even appropriate for frequent change of place. Probably this is the quality that makes our 1×3 and  1×3d the most desirable products in our catalog.
Our bestsellers!

<h3>Out with the Chemicals, in with the Natural Way of Teeth Whitening</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Complex laser treatments, intricate LED devices, uncomfortable dental trays or dental strips to bleach your teeth… there are many chemical-based treatments to help you whiten your teeth. However, why should you take these uncomfortable and unnatural approaches, when there is a perfectly natural, safe, simple and easy-to-use-at-home treatment to give you back that big shiny smile that you had before? That’s right: with Pupbeamo natural teeth whitening products, you can have a side-effect-free fully natural way of whitening your teeth and keeping them really healthy. Effortlessly.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why Pay a Lot When You Can Pay a Little?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Sophisticated chemical-based treatments are not only uncomfortable and possibly leading to nasty side effects… they are also extremely expensive and only somewhat effective. They keep you going to successive and extremely costly sessions with your dentist, knowing that, if you drop that expensive treatment for some reason (namely because you cannot afford it forever), results will quickly evaporate and your teeth will again suffer discoloration (meaning that all that you spent will be lost as well). So why pay so much for something with such limitations, when you can use Pupbeamo products for the easiest, cheapest and most natural method to keep your teeth white and healthy?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545377741/hs1eu0kxbboxlizajxje.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Power of Coconut Activated Charcoal </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Coffee, cigarette, tea, wine and other sources of stains in your teeth are very persistent dental discoloring agents. They either keep your teeth yellowish or darkish, and they make you feel bad about the smile that you keep hiding. They also leave certain odors that make you feel uncomfortable and self-conscious… that is until they meet the natural whitening power of activated charcoal obtained from the natural coconut shell. That’s the main ingredient that the Pupbeamo Teeth Whitening Powder uses to make your teeth go completely and naturally white, fresh and healthy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545377993/zrmu8qvesiqvry1y5qdu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Organically Fresh</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Pupbeamo Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder has an icy cool taste due to having certified organic sweet orange peel, peppermint and lemon myrtle – which will also remove stubborn stains, arm you against bacteria, boost your immune system, and remove toxins from your mouth. This means you’ll keep a fresh breath without worrying about harmful chemicals or additives that can damage your oral health.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Bamboo-style Oral Hygiene, not Plastic Bamboozle</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Pupbeamo offers yet another product that is truly special and made to make your oral hygiene and dental care go fully natural and healthy. Our Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush is processed and manufactured with antiseptics and Bamboo activated charcoal added to the toothbrush hair, allowing you to have an even more hygienic tooth-brushing process. Since it is made with Bamboo charcoal, which is processed under high-temperature heating, the Pupbeamo Toothbrush contains 3-10 times more delicate holes on the charcoal than normal charcoal from normal wood. This means that this toothbrush is the real deal that plastic toothbrushes, as fancy and expensive as they may be, can never compete with: our toothbrush absorbs any impurities and all sorts of odors, while also having antiseptic properties and humidity regulating features that ensure it dries completely and quickly, thus reducing the chance of bacteria growing.</p>

This means that this toothbrush is the real deal that plastic toothbrushes, as fancy and expensive as they may be, can never compete with: our toothbrush absorbs any impurities and all sorts of odors, while also having antiseptic properties and humidity regulating features that ensure it dries completely and quickly, thus reducing the chance of bacteria growing.


 





Risks & Challenges
Like all Indiegogo projects, we will face certain risks and challenges in delivering this product at the quality we demand of ourselves. However, the Pupbeamo team brings with it not only our passion but experience in engineering and manufacturing at scale, and we've made every effort to mitigate these risks for our backers.
With the support of our manufacturing and distribution partners, we are well prepared for the challenges ahead. We promise to be transparent and to keep our backers updated and informed about any issues that may come up and our solutions to such.

<p>We are a nonprofit Organization, building a Christian children camp in Chiang Mai, Thailand. We have been developing the camp facility since 2009. We offer the young people to come and enjoy the camp activities, and to learn the love of Jesus Christ. It is our mission and desire to share the gospel and minister to the children, sharing spiritual truth to children is a great joy. No one is more receptive, more hungry to learn, or more trusting than a child. </p>

<p>However, we are in the process of replacing the unsafe staff bungalows with new staff housing to serve the children. We are in need of housing for kitchen staff, ground staff and cleaning staff. Our goal is to raise $75,000.00 dollars to meet the estimated cost of this required work. It can be very difficult for people to get to and<br/>from the villages to the camp to work, so many of our full time staff members stay within the property. </p>

</div></div>","We are a nonprofit Organization, building a Christian children camp in Chiang Mai, Thailand. We have been developing the camp facility since 2009. We offer the young people to come and enjoy the camp activities, and to learn the love of Jesus Christ. It is our mission and desire to share the gospel and minister to the children, sharing spiritual truth to children is a great joy. No one is more receptive, more hungry to learn, or more trusting than a child. 

It is our love and compassion with a non-stop duty to teach the young children of hope and salvation. 

However, we are in the process of replacing the unsafe staff bungalows with new staff housing to serve the children. We are in need of housing for kitchen staff, ground staff and cleaning staff. Our goal is to raise $75,000.00 dollars to meet the estimated cost of this required work. It can be very difficult for people to get to andfrom the villages to the camp to work, so many of our full time staff members stay within the property. 

We would appreciate your potential donations. As a 501 (c) (3) organization, we will provide a tax receipt for all donations.

<p><b>Wood Crafted Beauty </b></p>
<p>We chose a beautiful wooden
housing for Cube that is an integral part of its sound delivery system. It adds to the richness and depth of the Cube audio and lends a modern look to your home.
Simple and stylish, Sugr is a natural way to listen to music.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Choice is Beautiful</b></p>
<p>We selected two beautiful
genuine wood veneers so that Cube would fit naturally into your home. Cherry (bottom)
and Maple (top). Each one is a natural wood grain that is totally unique and absolutely gorgeous. Additional painted colors are available on our <a href=""http://www.sugrsugr.com/index.php/products/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">webshop</a>. </p>

</div>
<div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Superior Sound Quality</b></p>
<p>Sound quality is paramount so Sugr Cube uses a bass-reflex
acoustic chamber sealed with 9mm thick MDF board. We custom designed and perfected the
vent tube to enhance bass performance in an efficient and natural sounding way.
This technology is common in high-end speakers but this is the first time it has
been applied to a portable speaker. This is bass that you can see and feel!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465781820/18_ke5sjg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We researched and optimized the
tuning of Sugr Cube for the most accurate sound that could be achieved. The
speaker driver unit is always the soul of a sound system, and we customized a neodymium
full-range driver unit to fit the Cube. The excellent frequency response and
extremely low THD guarantee the best sound quality in its class. Cube's mid and high range frequencies really sing!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465781947/19_uc02n3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Craftsmanship &amp; Reliability</b></p>
<p>We insist on quality so Sugr Cube is manufactured by the
same company that works for Focal (France), Dali (Denmark) and Klipsch (USA).
The quality of wood enclosure and speaker component has been validated by a global
market and embraced by our many users.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Technology</b></p>
<p>Sugr Cube is based on advanced
wireless computation architecture. It is a special system customized for audio
streaming applications. At Sugr we have developed a proprietary network audio
streaming &amp; control stack which achieves a 10x response speed over DLNA and
Airplay. We developed the capacitive touch technology for wooden surfaces and
we designed algorithms to accurately detect motion with sensors on a highly
vibrating object, the speaker itself. This results in amazing touch control ease and ability.</p>

One App to Rule Them All


The Cube app makes Wi-Fi setup
and streaming listening easy. It is compatible with iOS & Android and the
app is regularly updated to provide new features. Sugr Cube uses OTA Firmware
updates so your speaker is future-proof, Your Sugr Cube can always be updated to use our
newest features so it can be your favorite speaker for years to come. 

Wood Crafted Beauty 
We chose a beautiful wooden
housing for Cube that is an integral part of its sound delivery system. It adds to the richness and depth of the Cube audio and lends a modern look to your home.
Simple and stylish, Sugr is a natural way to listen to music.





Choice is Beautiful
We selected two beautiful
genuine wood veneers so that Cube would fit naturally into your home. Cherry (bottom)
and Maple (top). Each one is a natural wood grain that is totally unique and absolutely gorgeous. Additional painted colors are available on our webshop. 





Superior Sound Quality
Sound quality is paramount so Sugr Cube uses a bass-reflex
acoustic chamber sealed with 9mm thick MDF board. We custom designed and perfected the
vent tube to enhance bass performance in an efficient and natural sounding way.
This technology is common in high-end speakers but this is the first time it has
been applied to a portable speaker. This is bass that you can see and feel!





We researched and optimized the
tuning of Sugr Cube for the most accurate sound that could be achieved. The
speaker driver unit is always the soul of a sound system, and we customized a neodymium
full-range driver unit to fit the Cube. The excellent frequency response and
extremely low THD guarantee the best sound quality in its class. Cube's mid and high range frequencies really sing!





Craftsmanship & Reliability
We insist on quality so Sugr Cube is manufactured by the
same company that works for Focal (France), Dali (Denmark) and Klipsch (USA).
The quality of wood enclosure and speaker component has been validated by a global
market and embraced by our many users.





Technology
Sugr Cube is based on advanced
wireless computation architecture. It is a special system customized for audio
streaming applications. At Sugr we have developed a proprietary network audio
streaming & control stack which achieves a 10x response speed over DLNA and
Airplay. We developed the capacitive touch technology for wooden surfaces and
we designed algorithms to accurately detect motion with sensors on a highly
vibrating object, the speaker itself. This results in amazing touch control ease and ability.







Wi-Fi Speed & Benefits
Sugr Cube uses Wi-Fi rather than
Bluetooth to achieve greater speed, performance and connectivity without the
interruptions and limitations of Bluetooth. This superior connection means a better listening experience for you.

Beautifully Packaged & Delivered

Our attention to detail extends to every part of our product. Cube is shipped in a beautiful and protective storage box and includes power adapters for any international wall outlet.

Can you think of a place you made your mark on with a special moment? Take home a piece of this memory with LOGIPLACES!

LOGIPLACES is a 16 or 36-piece puzzle made of concrete, that enables you to take home a piece of memory you made at any place in the world. 

Is there a neighbourhood that means a lot to you?
Get the location of your most memorable moments with LOGIPLACES.
On the picture above: Budapest, Downtown area

Places grow when we fill them with experiences.
This one-of-a-kind tabletop sculpture will help you see the place in a new perspective.

Let go of the noise of everyday life either at home or work, and unleash your imagination while training your mind with a unique puzzle made of concrete.









Why do we need YOU to bring the LOGIPLACES project to life?
Some of you might know already, that we’ve been through a crowdfunding campaign exactly one year ago with our first concrete product, LOGIFACES. During the LOGIFACES campaign, we had amazing backers, and it was great to get so much funding and feedback to realize our dream.
Now we’ve evolved the LOGIFACES brand to LOGIDEEZ, an umbrella brand representing our concrete 3D puzzles, and we would like to be able to start production of LOGIPLACES as well. 


Our long-term goal is to be able to provide our customers with any place they would like to see in their homes, but until then, we need to raise initial capital in order to be able to start 3D modeling, 3D printing and creating moulds for more and more places.



LOGIPLACES X LOGIFACES = LOGIDEEZ PUZZLE BUNDLE




Are you interested in both of our 3D concrete puzzles? You're in luck then, because this year, we chose to include both of our products in this campaign. 



LOGIFACES is a set of prisms, each with different top angles, hand-poured from concrete.

There is only one rule to the game: Create a form by playing the prisms next to each other to form a continuous surface! 




LOGIFACES can be arranged in millions of variations, allowing you to find endless patterns in its computer-generated forms.

For more info on LOGIFACES, please visit our website!
So check out our perks and choose one of the two LOGIPLACES X LOGIFACES bundles that's closest to your heart!


A toy you’ll be proud to exhibit


We create our toys for the design enthusiasts, as well as those who love a brain teaser. When you own one of our LOGIDEEZ toys, you don’t have to worry about packing up when you’re done playing.


“We would like to see beautiful, one of a kind architectural concepts in stores more often, especially in the world of games, where it’s rare to see a toy that also reflects on contemporary design.” 
 - Daniel Lakos, co-inventor



State-of-the-art 3D technology enables us to create our moulds to pour concrete.
Mixed with the careful work of our concrete manufactury, LOGIPLACES is a playable landscape on the verge of modern and traditional.

The inspiration to create LOGIPLACES came when working for the What-to-print-in-3D design competition. At this competition, we won our own 3D printer, a Makerbot Replicator 2, what we used to create the samples for the moulds with a 100 micron resolution. 



Taking the puzzle experience to a new level with concrete.
Concrete takes the puzzle experience to a new level with its different touch and mass. We pour, grind and polish each piece, utilising our award-winning, many years of experience in the production of design objects.






Display it in your home or office when you’re not playing with it.
Packaging was also important for us to create the best experience, especially because LOGIPLACES is not only a toy, it’s also great for decorating a home or office, when you’re not playing with it. That’s why our box can easily function as a display, highlighting the best qualities of the LOGIPLACES design.





The LOGIPLACES cities & landscapes
What’s your favorite place on Earth?


Right now, we’ve been able to model 4 places to start production with: Grand Canyon, Zermatt in the Alps, Budapest and San Francisco.
















 

Do you want to be part of creating our next models?
We aim to make as many custom-made models as possible with the help of your funding. So we decided that after reaching our goal, we’ll introduce a new place at every additional $5,000 we get. 
Each of our backers will have the opportunity after our campaign ends to choose whether you would like to have the core 4 models or one of the new ones.
And you can also help us choose the next models we create! What should we introduce next?

Please keep in mind that we made suggestions in this poll, because there are some cities that cannot be executed with LOGIPLACES at this point - to our knowledge.



How can you help us in creating LOGIPLACES? Get your own set!

They took big risks, but were compelled by wide-eyed hope. Desiring to live a life more rooted in community, they began to explore the needs and abundance in their city. <br/><br/>As strangers in a new place they began to meet other strangers; strangers with greater needs than our own. They encountered <i>Refugees </i>attempting to resettle in the city from Burma, from the Congo, from Somalia, from Sudan and from Cuba. </p><p></p><p>1000+ refugees resettle in the city of Syracuse each year and <span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">12% of the children in our city school district are refugees. 30% of this population lives below the poverty line. ~ Onondaga </span>Citizens<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> L</span></span>eague</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We've listened to their stories and our hearts were broken open to their struggles. </span></p><p>Many Refugees struggle to find ways to survive. These struggles are as basic as finding a minimum wage job, learning how to drive, acclimating their children to our foreign school system and most importantly finding faithful friends that will walk the journey with them. </p><br/>We've become bonded friends with those struggling to make a new life here.

</h4><br/></div>","The Story of Renewal for Refugees Six years ago a core of families left their homes and jobs from around the Northeast and moved into an under-resourced neighborhood in Syracuse, NY. They took big risks, but were compelled by wide-eyed hope. Desiring to live a life more rooted in community, they began to explore the needs and abundance in their city. As strangers in a new place they began to meet other strangers; strangers with greater needs than our own. They encountered Refugees attempting to resettle in the city from Burma, from the Congo, from Somalia, from Sudan and from Cuba. 1000+ refugees resettle in the city of Syracuse each year and 12% of the children in our city school district are refugees. 30% of this population lives below the poverty line. ~ Onondaga Citizens LeagueWe've listened to their stories and our hearts were broken open to their struggles. Many Refugees struggle to find ways to survive. These struggles are as basic as finding a minimum wage job, learning how to drive, acclimating their children to our foreign school system and most importantly finding faithful friends that will walk the journey with them. We've become bonded friends with those struggling to make a new life here. In our work we've discerned the need for a designated space for pressing into this local issue. In this space (The Renewal House) we envision 5 initiatives: 1. Develop ESL opportunities2. Develop job coaching opportunities3. Develop adopt a refugee family opportunities 4. Develop child care/tutoring opportunities5. Develop organic relationships. Our goal is to raise $100,000 which will fully purchase this house and provide renovations to the building. Our partner Salt City Coffee is financing and outfitting the first floor of the building with a quality coffee shop. Our Axiom Community (faith-based non-profit) has already raised $35,000. We are raising $65,000 via this platform. 
This Renewal House will provide ongoing support for local refugees equipping them and helping them discern next steps toward sustainable roots.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

This means you could prevent the invisible harmful microorganism in the toilet seat from jeopardizing the health of you and your families. Overview Early Orders Get Early ShippingTo make sure our backers can start using the product as soon as possible, we'll put the orders into production when every 1,000 units are sold on Indiegogo and start shipping right after with the best logistic solutions we can find. You Need to Sterilize The Toilet Seat!Toilet Seat - The Primary Source of Bowel & Genital DiseasesOur living environment is full of harmful microorganisms, especially places that we get in contact with everyday like the toilets seat are the primary source of germs and viruses. They cause minor or serious diseases to people and jeopardize the health of the ones you love every day. Germs Spread Through Cross-Infection Many of the diseases are spread through cross-infection in public places or between family members. Sterilizing the toilet on a daily base helps to prevent all kinds of diseases caused by the toilets directly or indirectly. Say Good-bye To The Old WaysThere are many kinds of sterilization solutions out there, but they are either laborious, ineffective, time-consuming, or damaging to the objects we sterilize. You deserve a better way to keep your toilet germ-free! PrePure  - Born for Toilet SterilizationFeaturing 8 UV-C LEDs for a 360° all-around ultraviolet emission, strong & continuous ultraviolet rays irradiation, and smart detection for human safety, PrePure is the ultimate solution to keep your toilet and personal belongings germ-free! Sterilize over 99% of the Germs in No Time!
Have your toilet seat and inside walls thoroughly sterilized with PrePure. See Test Report down this page.

 
360° All-Around SterilizationWith the built-in 8 UV-C LEDs, each one emitting 120° powerful ultraviolet, PrePure carries out a 360° all-around sterilization to eliminate the germs in every corner of the toilet.P.S. UV-C LEDs will be turned off with an open lid, the above image is for demonstration only. Smart Detection for Human SafetyStrong ultraviolet rays could be harmful to human bodies. Directly looking at the ultraviolet rays or have it emitted to the skin could bring irreversible harm to the eyes and body.Bearing the safety-first principle in mind, the PrePure is designed to keep users safe, regardless of gender and age. Auto On/Off When Closing/Opening The Toilet LidPrePure would automatically turn on the ultraviolet when the toilet lid is laid down and turn off when the toilet lid is opened up to make sure the ultraviolet rays do not get in contact with humans. Auto Cut-out When Detached from the BaseEvery now and then people may uninstall the sterilizer for charging or travel. To prevent accidental harm to anyone, there's no way users can turn on the UV-C LEDs when the sterilizer is detached from the base.  Easy to Install and CarryEasy InstallationPrePure comes with two types of base: Adhesive Mounting Base for home and Suction Cup Base for travel. After attaching the base to the toilet lid, simply slide the sterilizer down to install it to the base and up to uninstall it from the base. SafeGuard Companion On-the-goWith the size of a mobile phone, PrePure is super portable. Have the PrePure installed at your home or carry it with you to work or travel to keep yourself and the ones you care about away from the germs in the toilet wherever you go. Keep Everything Germ-FreeWorking with PrePure's foldable disinfection box, PrePure Smart UV-C Sterilizer can sterilize pretty much all your daily gadgets, accessories, and belongings. PrePure v.s.

We were part of that, and collectively have about 25 years experience building popular and useful cloud-based services such as Google’s flagship search engine.</p><p>Nowadays, unfortunately, the cloud often does not make services much better. You, the consumer, are often the real cloud product, and your service is paid for by a loss of control over your data. You may have no practical alternative, but at least it’s free and convenient.</p><p>Over lunch one day in 2016, our founders, Chao Liu and Arup Mukherjee, observed that cloud-based cameras offer even less. In exchange for ease of use and analysis of your video, you give up your privacy, get locked into an ecosystem of limited camera choices, risk owning a paperweight if your cloud service is discontinued, and get charged an arm and a leg for the privilege.</p><p>As camera enthusiasts and computer scientists, Arup and Chao knew that everything offered by the cloud camera giants could be done locally, and decided to build themselves the system they would have liked to buy. That system managed data locally but preserved cloud-like convenience, and a lot of work went into making sure it produced alerts that were actually usable. It turned out to be the system that several friends wanted too, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>Three years and many improvements later, we have decided to share Camect with the world. We believe it’s smarter than the alternatives, just as convenient, maintains your ownership of your data, and happens to cost much less. It also learns from your feedback, and gets smarter for everyone -- without compromising privacy -- the more feedback it gets.</p><p>We would be honored to have you join us in the quest for the best home security camera system out there!</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567528524/mcqwdsftvtxwxg6ssjmd.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562771434/wx7v9ze9zvxpztqqucpj.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562771456/ugs7bs0pppiyjcx7w1fy.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562771473/qc7xbrikrip5hmtngl6v.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We ship worldwide.

       Camect’s exterior might be sleek and small, but it houses big, sophisticated technology that makes all the difference in home security.    “We believe that the best way for us to keep your videodata private is for us not to see it at all.”That’s the first line of our privacy policy -- and the reason that Camect was born.We remember the days when tech companies grew by creating cloud-based services that actually need to be in the cloud. We were part of that, and collectively have about 25 years experience building popular and useful cloud-based services such as Google’s flagship search engine.Nowadays, unfortunately, the cloud often does not make services much better. You, the consumer, are often the real cloud product, and your service is paid for by a loss of control over your data. You may have no practical alternative, but at least it’s free and convenient.Over lunch one day in 2016, our founders, Chao Liu and Arup Mukherjee, observed that cloud-based cameras offer even less. In exchange for ease of use and analysis of your video, you give up your privacy, get locked into an ecosystem of limited camera choices, risk owning a paperweight if your cloud service is discontinued, and get charged an arm and a leg for the privilege.As camera enthusiasts and computer scientists, Arup and Chao knew that everything offered by the cloud camera giants could be done locally, and decided to build themselves the system they would have liked to buy. That system managed data locally but preserved cloud-like convenience, and a lot of work went into making sure it produced alerts that were actually usable. It turned out to be the system that several friends wanted too, and the rest, as they say, is history.Three years and many improvements later, we have decided to share Camect with the world. We believe it’s smarter than the alternatives, just as convenient, maintains your ownership of your data, and happens to cost much less. It also learns from your feedback, and gets smarter for everyone -- without compromising privacy -- the more feedback it gets.We would be honored to have you join us in the quest for the best home security camera system out there!    We ship worldwide.

<p>If you have ever watched an action movie it's likely that you've seen a lock being picked, and I'll bet that secretly, you've always wanted to try it.  I mean, lets admit it...lock picking is a pretty cool skill to have, the ultimate party trick, and  it's very useful when you've lost the key to your padlock! <br/><br/>Wouldn't it be great if you could have a set of lock picks on you all of the time? Well now you can with the highly affordable SonOfStephen metal lock pick card. </p>
<p>Each SonOfStephen metal lock pick card features a set of 6 snap out lock picking tools, and 3 snap out tension wrenches. The set includes a Half Diamond, Hook, Snake Rake, Double Round,, L Rake, and my favourite - the Bogota! The cards measure 54mm x 86mm which is the same size as a standard credit card - perfect for storing in your wallet. They're made from 0.5mm thick hard rolled Stainless Steel, and whilst they are thin, they are also incredibly strong, making them perfect for picking locks!</p>

<h1>How?</h1>
<p>The cards are manufactured using a process called photo chemical etching. This method of manufacturing ensures incredible cutting/etching accuracy, and beautifully clean burr free edges. The cards will be manufactured in the UK, and everything is set and ready to go...all i need is the funding.</p>
<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>They're cool,they're useful, they're portable, they're inexpensive, they're great fun to use, and they are great to give as a gift. Try picking a lock when you're next stuck in traffic...it really does help you pass the time! <br/></p>
<h1>When?</h1>
<p>Provided everything goes according to plan and I receive the required funding, you should receive your metal lock pick card very promptly. Most likely in November 2013.</p>
<h1>The Funding</h1>
<p>When I made this video I thought I needed at least £5000 to get this project up and running. However, due to some good old negotiation with my supplier, I'm able to get these picks to market with just £1000. I need this money to place quite a large order with the manufacturers so that I can bring the retail price down to an affordable  level. <br/></p>
<h1>General Info</h1>
<p>Speed Lock picking is a genuine sport that is enjoyed by people all over the world, so why not give it a go and see if its something that you enjoy doing.</p>
<p>These lock pick cards fit perfectly into birthday cards and guarantee a smile every time. So if you want to give a little gift without breaking the bank balance, why not try giving one of these!</p>

The health emergency of COVID-19 has isolated us and forced us into confinement: we are closed in at home, deprived of work and social contacts, and unable to perform actions that up until very recently were taken for granted, such as going to concerts or shaking hands.Many people in different fields are looking for answers to this emergency, using the tools they know best. There are musicians and actors who organize streaming events to liven up monotonous days, engineers and makers who combine their skills to help hospitals in trouble, textile entrepreneurs who reconvert their factories for the production of masks.We too, as a small manufacturing reality forced into lockdown, wondered what our answer might have been. So, after transferring part of our equipment to the garage at home, we decided to take advantage of our time to work on a project that was on the one hand the demonstration of how companies such as ours can live with the crisis during isolation, and on the other being a tangible help for the on-going health emergency.Hence Esse, the lamp that challenges the lockdown.  What is EsseEsse is a table lamp made in cement designed to be made even in periods like this, characterized by the scarcity of equipment and supplies, where ""know-how"" and design are the only resources available.In this sense, the lamp evidences a possible resistance from the world of design in the face of the global upheaval we are witnessing.  The awareness of limitations has been the reason it was given its monolithic aspect; its shape and essential lines are the result of the inability to make complex moulds working inside the house, while the side slot was created to allow the installation of electrical wiring even without equipment.Know-how gained over the years on the craftsmanship of cement has given colour and rigor to the Esse lamp. The chosen colours - grey, red and yellow - are as primary as the light modes that the lamp can guarantee, direct and shielded, thanks to its half-cylinder shape.   Concrete aid to combat COVID-19Esse is also a concrete contribution against the pandemic, since half of the proceeds from sales will be donated to help all countries affected by the virus.To allow as many people as possible to participate in the donation, it was decided to give the lamps at the symbolic price of €35 (to which are added €35 for donation) instead of €128.  How we will use the money collectedFor each piece sold we will donate € 35 to the Lang Europe Onlus Foundation in support of the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund of the World Health Organization. Donations support WHO’s work, including with partners, to track and understand the spread of the virus; to ensure patients get the care they need and frontline workers get essential supplies and information; and to accelerate research and development of a vaccine and treatments for all who need them.Some donations also support Fund partners UNICEF, for its work on COVID-19 among vulnerable communities including children, and the vaccine development alliance CEPI. https://covid19responsefund.org/The remaining €35 will be used for campaign management, moulds realisation and materials purchase.   Technical specifications

   Who is Plato DesignWe are Alessandro Mattei and Caterina Naglieri, two designers with training in architecture, that has taken us around the world for years in many international design studios. In 2016 we decided to drop everything to return to our city, Rome, and start from scratch with our own project and a start-up that, thanks to a crowd-funding, allowed us to create our first product, the D-Twelve lamp.Thus Plato Design was born, a laboratory in which we make lamps and home objects entirely handmade in Italy. Among our favourite materials is cement; in a few years from our home-laboratory we managed to develop a small creative industry that exports all over the world.Now the lockdown due to the virus has taken us back to those days of 4 years ago, when we closed ourselves inside the walls of our house to let our minds flow to give shape our ideas.For us, design means exactly this: never stop looking towards tomorrow.  http://www.platodesign.it/Project in collaboration with Sign Press di Isabella Clara Sciacca https://www.signpress.it/    Special thanksThe entire Esse Lamp project and the crowdfunding campaign were carried out during lockdown between March and April 2020.

What We Need & What You Get



How
It all started when mama Motley & daddy Motley loved each other very much …
…
No… that didn't happen, it was a bit more technical than that! :)
It all started when we thought it would be really cool to make cultural characters as playful decorative ornaments.
So we picked a number of recognisable characters and started experimenting, each character has a similar shaped head and body, but their individuality is emphasised in their hats, body colour and little accessories.
Also, super strong magnets are glued into each part, allowing them to stick together really easily, and it also makes them super fun to play with. Don't worry, you will never see any of the magnets as we have magically hidden them in the wooden pieces.

 
Materials / Materiales
The concept of The Motleys is to create beautiful little characters that will be enjoyed and admired. So we have selected the highest quality and most appropriate materials to make sure each Motley will remain as a playful decorative ornament for many generations.
The Motleys are made from:

Solid hardwood.
Magnets.
Natural wood dyes.
Natural oil finish.
Brass.
Leather. 


The Impact
Long-lasting design
The motley's have been designed to be simple and robust in their appearance and their construction, this ensures that they will have an extended life cycle that justifies the natural resources required to produce them. And when the Motleys are old and grey after many many years or decades, they can be recycled safely and easily back in the ecosystem.
Sustainable materials
As the main ingredient of The Motleys is yummy renewable and recyclable hardwood. We are going one step further and ensuring that it will be sourced from certified and managed forests with FSC certification.
Sustainable fulfilment and distribution
The packaging that will be needed to get your rewards to you, will be carefully considered to ensure the minimum material is used to maximum effect, reducing package weight to optimise deliveries and reduce environmental impact.Where possible only packaging from recycled and or renewable sources will be used in the fulfilment of your reward. In addition, we will endeavour to minimise the use of any non-recyclable plastics anywhere in the process of creating The Motleys.
Something else
In addition to all of this, we are partnering with Tree-Nation, an organisation with a mission to ""reforest the world"". We are pledging to plant a minimum of five trees for every pledge we receive, this is all to help the fight against deforestation, alleviate poverty and empower local communities in some of the most environmentally affected parts of the world.As the Motleys are characters of honour! It is our promise to them and you, that we will not to dishonour them!We will do our best to bring them to life with an absolutely minimum carbon footprint and where possible carbon neutral or even carbon positive.
 
The guys behind The Motleys 
We are David and Diego, we are two designers but more importantly, we are two friends who enjoy creating concepts that engage people. We really love the playful diversity of The Motleys and we hope you will do too.


 
Risks & Challenges
We have already overcome many challenges in building our campaign and developing every element of it, from establishing the goal we need to produce our first batch of Motleys to the rewards we can offer.The risks we identify that our project might be exposed to:

Not achieving our goal will mean we will not have the funds to produce our first batch.
Delays to our schedule as a result of manufacturing problems

<h3>The Impact - 4 more homes built:</h3> <p>The success of this Indiegogo fund raising campaign will result in the Project J8 Mission Team having the construction materials onsite, when we arrive in mid-February, 2016 for our 2 week Mission Trip, to build 4 simple homes for individuals or families, as designated by local housing authorities from the Diocese of Mandeville as being in need of one of these simple homes.</p>
<p>The cost of construction materials for one of these simple homes is approximately $4,000 - $4,500 (USD). All of the construction materials used in the building of one of these simple home are imported from the United States. Some considerable lead time is then required to have these construction material onsite for use by the Project J7 Mission Team in mid-February, 2016.</p>
<p>Other impacts resulting from our Project J8 Mission Trip will be: another 1,000 lbs of donated women's, men's, children's and baby's clothing will be delivered along with another 20 suitcases to be used for storage of clean clothing. Team members will reconnect with some special Jamaicans that all Project J Teams have visited alone with visits to Bosco Homes, Compassion House and a number of local schools where we will leave donated supplies and financial donations to support their good works. Most importantly we will have the opportunity to meet and interact with many wonder Jamaicans who are our sisters and brothers.</p>

<div>Project J Mission Team members have always paid any costs associated with their own Mission Trip, with the exception of airfare for the 10 members of the Mission Team that is covered by a generous donation from St. Peter's Columbus Club in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</div>

The Opportunity To Change: How many of us will have the opportunity to

one of our sisters and brothers in need living in another country and then

For many of us, probably never or maybe once in a

Since 2006, when the first Project J Mission

of our Project J Mission Trips.
I am sure that many of us did not even think of
our participation in a particular Project J Mission Trip as an opportunity to
be a direct agent of influence or change in the life of a fellow human being.

 Since 2006, the 70 individuals, women, men, and young adults from St.

Mission Trips to the Mandeville area of Jamaica.
So of the things that we have done to
assist our sisters and brothers in the Mandeville area of Jamaica through our Project 1 - 7 Mission

this area of Jamaica.


Contributed over
$30,000.00 to the economy of Jamaica in Room & Board fees when on our 7 previous
Mission Trips.


Contributed uncountable
dollars to the economy of Jamaica by purchasing food and other liquid
refreshments when teams are on these Mission Trips.

Mission Trip members have
made unknown amounts of Project J and individual donations to support a number
of individuals in the Mandeville area of Jamaica, as identified to be in special need of our support, and to
the Seniors Center,  Bosco Home for Boys and a children's orphanage and parishes
where they attended Sunday celebrations.

Other impacts resulting from our Project J8 Mission Trip will be: another 1,000 lbs of donated women's, men's, children's and baby's clothing will be delivered along with another 20 suitcases to be used for storage of clean clothing. Team members will reconnect with some special Jamaicans that all Project J Teams have visited alone with visits to Bosco Homes, Compassion House and a number of local schools where we will leave donated supplies and financial donations to support their good works. Most importantly we will have the opportunity to meet and interact with many wonder Jamaicans who are our sisters and brothers.

  

Risks & Challenges.
 As Project J8 will be our eigth Mission Trip to the Mandeville area of Jamaica we anticipate few risks and challenges on this Mission Trip. A number of members of 10 member Project J8 Mission Team are repeat members and that will add to our ability to deal with any risks and challenges that may arise.
We are also in the capable hands of an experienced crew of individuals from the Diocese of Mandeville who have a great deal of experience in dealing with Mission Trips such as yours.

Project J Team Members Pay Their Own Way.
It is important for donors to this campaign to know that NO donated funds will be used to fund any aspect of the Project J8 Mission Trip other than to pay for construction materials to build our 4 simple homes.
Project J Mission Team members have always paid any costs associated with their own Mission Trip, with the exception of airfare for the 10 members of the Mission Team that is covered by a generous donation from St. Peter's Columbus Club in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>The Eques App puts your front door at your fingertips no matter where you are. Since VEIU runs off your home's Wi-Fi, you have a secure connection from your smartphone to your VEIU anywhere with a network connection.</p>
<p>Many smart home products require expensive monthly subscriptions that can run you hundreds of dollars a year. With VEIU there are no monthly cloud storage fees, your only expense is the hardware. The Eques App is available as a free download from both Google Play and the Apple App Store</p>

<p><b>Do I need a Wi-Fi connection to set up my VEIU? </b></p>
<p>The VEIU Doorbell can be used with or without WiFi connection.  To maximize VEIU's benefits, use a wireless internet connection to enable its smart features, including the ability to send live video and audio straight to your smartphone. VEIU is compatible with wireless routers running on 2.4 GHz.</p>
<p><b>Does VEIU require direct power lines to function? </b></p>
<p>No. VEIU operates wirelessly using its built-in battery. The battery lasts an average of 2 months after each complete charge. </p>
<p><b>Do I need to have an existing peep hole for VEIU to work on my door? </b></p>
<p>No. If your door does not have a peephole, don’t worry at all.  Feel free to request a free drill bit to safely drill a hole in your door.  Drill bits will be available at the end of our campaign.  We will be sure to send it along with your backed product. </p>
<p><b>How long does it take the for the battery to fully charge? </b></p>

<p><b>Do I need to remove the indoor panel to charge it?</b> </p>
<p>The indoor panel can be easily removed from the door mount for charging. In addition, we also provide a 10 foot (3 meters) charging cable for those who may find it more convenient to plug your product into a nearby outlet. Alternatively, you may use a power bank to charge your device.</p>
<p><b>Will VEIU notify me when it is time to charge the system? </b></p>
<p>Yes.  The VEIU app features a low-battery warning and a battery level indicator on the indoor touch screen that you can check anytime.</p>
<p><b>Are there any additional fees? </b></p>
<p>No. For standard services, VEIU devices operate without any monthly fees.  The free cloud based storage will allow you to save up to 15 day’s worth of videos or images.</p>
<p><b>What if someone steals my VIEU Doorbell? </b></p>
<p>The VEIU Doorbell is equipped with proprietary security screws that keep the device securely mounted, which makes it difficult to take.  However, if your VEIU does get stolen, the outdoor camera will not function without the indoor panel, so it’d be useless for the thief.  If this happens, please contact us with a police report, and we’ll be happy to replace your device for free.</p>

<p>Download our free VEIU App from App Store or Google Play Store -- both under our company name, EQUES. Please note that this App is also compatible with other Eques smart devices. When you install VEIU, make sure that you select the VEIU device option. </p>
<p><b>What happens if my Wi-Fi goes out? </b></p>
<p>If you lose wireless internet connection, VEIU will not be able to send audio and video data to your smart devices.  However, your device can continue to operate with saved data in its local storage.  The 2GB local storage is included in the product and can save up to 20,000 images.</p>
<p><b>Do I have to replace my existing doorbell? </b></p>
<p>Replacing your old doorbell is not required. VEIU PIR (Passive Infra-Red) Sensor operates without needing to press your traditional doorbell button. You can still check the live video and chat with your visitors through VEIU App on your smart devices. </p>
<p><b>My front door is glass. Will I be able to install VEIU? </b></p>

<p>We’re aiming for July 2017.</p>
<p><b>SHIPPING: How will my product be shipped?</b> <b>Will there be tracking numbers? </b></p>
<p>DOMESTIC: US orders will ship from our Los Angeles center using ground service (USPS priority, FedEx, or UPS -- depending on destination and shipment size).  Tracking information will be provided.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL: Non-US orders will ship from one of our 3 international warehouses located in London, Hong Kong, and Toronto. To save money for our backers, we will import all of our products to the aforementioned countries before shipping them to you.  This means that your shipments… 1. Won't require taxes or fees in Canada, EU and HK (other countries may have applicable fees/taxes; please check with your customs office for specific details). 2. Will arrive more quickly rather than being held up in customs. 3. May have tracking, though not guaranteed (depending on the particular post service). For EU and Asian backers, Royal Mail International or Hong Kong Post will most likely be used. Note that we cannot alter the value of your rewards on customs declarations -- the value will be declared as the total value of the items contained in the shipment.</p>
<p><b>What is your return policy? </b> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t offer refunds or returns on items received as Kickstarter rewards.  The support from our Kickstarter backers enables us to run and grow our business, gather customer feedback, design new products, and improve existing ones.  In our Kickstarter community, the items that you receive after making a pledge are referred to as ""rewards"" because they are not traditional purchases.  Instead, they are gifts - in our case, camera products - that are sent to our supporters as a token of our appreciation.  In the same way that public television funds their service through their supporters’ pledges and how supporters receive gifts, we have chosen to run and grow our business with a crowdfunded business model. We sincerely thank our backers for helping Eques move forward in this journey.</p>

Unfortunately, we don’t offer refunds or returns on items received as Kickstarter rewards.  The support from our Kickstarter backers enables us to run and grow our business, gather customer feedback, design new products, and improve existing ones.  In our Kickstarter community, the items that you receive after making a pledge are referred to as ""rewards"" because they are not traditional purchases.  Instead, they are gifts - in our case, camera products - that are sent to our supporters as a token of our appreciation.  In the same way that public television funds their service through their supporters’ pledges and how supporters receive gifts, we have chosen to run and grow our business with a crowdfunded business model. We sincerely thank our backers for helping Eques move forward in this journey.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

That is why purification of indoor quality is crucial to your health. However, the tradition HEPA purifiers offered in the market are not able to  destroy harmful chemicals in the air, which may cause headache, asthma, heart disease and cancer. More importantly the only filter those harmful pollutants but not able to destroy them.  That may lead to secondary pollution. Cyairnova started out 5 years ago to develop air purifier that really remove VOCs, allergens, odors and more.  By employing the most advanced and highly effective nano photocatalytic purification process, it remove the above problem totally.Cyairnova latest model XP3000 comes with a washable and durable stainless steel filter, you never need to spend money to replace filter again.  PNPO® Technology employed a patented nano-particle coating for air purification. It is designed for completely removing pollutants in the air. PNPO®  filter works when a carefully chosen UV light shines on the nano-particle coated filter.  A reaction that oxidize the pollutants in the air.In the process occurred in the Filter surface produce a lot of free hydroxyl free radicals. The hydroxyl free radicals oxidize pollutants at the filter surface and convert them into harmless elements like tiny amount of water and carbon dioxide.According to third party independent testing, the efficacy of this nano coating shown great efficacy in removing volatile organic compounds(VOCs), mold and harmful micro infection sources.  No residue was found on the surface of the nano-coated filter surface. In short, the conventional technologies, such as  HEPA, carbon and electrostatic filters, they do not destroy these pollutants at all. In our comprehensive testing process, we found that the XP3000 had an impressive efficiency rate. Impressive as that may seem, there’s more the XP3000 can do. It can remove VOCs quickly and is a major feature that’s passed down from our previous models.We’ve received praise from pilot users who were satisfied with the XP3000’s performance, particularly removing allergens, VOCs and pollutants in the air.In the following table, it shows a the major difference among different types of air purification technology.  The following image is the magnified portion of the stainless stain filter. The whole porous surfaces are coated with nano Photo-catalytic compounds. It is designed to be washed to avoid buying expensive filter replacement periodically.The XP3000 has manual controls that comes with the bundle. It’s also has an app you can download on your iPhone or Android device.The XP3000 app makes operating the air purifier super easy. For one, you can have the unit ready to purify the air when you’re minutes away from home. You’ll be greeted by fresh, clean air the moment you step in the front door.Length of operation can be set to 1, 4 or 8 hours depending on the time of day and need. The product houses a 3-speed fan that auto-adjusts according to air quality. Manual fan control is also available.A single long LED light bar at the air purifier’s front panel shows you the VOC condition status of the room. Red light means that it detects high levels of VOCs, while green means indoor air quality is at an optimal level.Near the top of the unit is the carbon-based filter that can remove unwanted odors.

<h2>YOUR DOG’S FOOD &amp; WATER BOWLS ARE THE FOURTH GERMIEST SURFACES IN YOUR HOME</h2>
<p>We all love our pets and wash their bowls thoroughly every day… right? But did you know that this is not enough to kill the germs; as microbes, such as bacteria, mould and fungi continue to grow and multiply rapidly even after a thorough wash. Interestingly, we learned that 67% of bowls coming out of the dishwasher still have Salmonella bacteria present on their surfaces. A study has shown they are the fourth dirtiest surfaces in our homes after the kitchen sponge, kitchen sink and our toothbrush holder (According to the NSF - National Sanitation Foundation)</p>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529918350/xdkjtp04ttjlyszqnhc6.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<p>Example of an unprotected surface, showing the effects of a water bowl in constant use<br/>without antimicrobial protection. </p>
<h2>WHY CLEANING OUR PET’S BOWLS EVERY DAY IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS WE THINK</h2>
<p>A while back, a team of microbiologists explained to us that the effects of cleaning are short lived, and once the effects have worn off, our dog bowls are subject to recontamination, leaving bacteria to thrive unchecked until the next clean.</p>
<p>It’s sort of like the antibacterial hand sanitizers or surface sprays we’ve become accustomed to using. If a surface isn’t continuously resistant to bacteria, the germs continue to thrive and multiply. The fat found in pet food for example is breeding-ground heaven for bacteria! Customers often tell us that they have to keep cleaning the face area of their dogs after they have eaten or been drinking out of their regular water and food bowls because of the bacteria that builds up in their fur which can lead to skin irritations and even dog acne. Just imagine a solution that would keep your dog’s water bowl clean and germ free….</p>
<h2>INTRODUCING THE HERO BOWL </h2>
<p>The HERO Bowl is a superior alternative to stainless steel, glass or ceramic products. It is made from recyclable polypropylene and has 24-hour protection from a technology that works constantly to reduce microbes, such as bacteria, mould and fungi, by up to 99.99% on the protected surface. Like all pet bowls, the HERO Bowl should be cleaned regularly, but unlike on an unprotected bowl, the risk of microbial cross contamination from the HERO Bowl is actively reduced as the built-in BioCote® technology continues to perform against the colonisation of bacteria, perfectly complementing existing hygiene practices. We partnered with BioCote® - a world leader in proven antimicrobial technology - to bring to you the world’s most hygienic dog bowl.</p>

We all love our pets and wash their bowls thoroughly every day… right? But did you know that this is not enough to kill the germs; as microbes, such as bacteria, mould and fungi continue to grow and multiply rapidly even after a thorough wash. Interestingly, we learned that 67% of bowls coming out of the dishwasher still have Salmonella bacteria present on their surfaces. A study has shown they are the fourth dirtiest surfaces in our homes after the kitchen sponge, kitchen sink and our toothbrush holder (According to the NSF - National Sanitation Foundation)

Example of an unprotected surface, showing the effects of a water bowl in constant usewithout antimicrobial protection. 
WHY CLEANING OUR PET’S BOWLS EVERY DAY IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS WE THINK
A while back, a team of microbiologists explained to us that the effects of cleaning are short lived, and once the effects have worn off, our dog bowls are subject to recontamination, leaving bacteria to thrive unchecked until the next clean.
It’s sort of like the antibacterial hand sanitizers or surface sprays we’ve become accustomed to using. If a surface isn’t continuously resistant to bacteria, the germs continue to thrive and multiply. The fat found in pet food for example is breeding-ground heaven for bacteria! Customers often tell us that they have to keep cleaning the face area of their dogs after they have eaten or been drinking out of their regular water and food bowls because of the bacteria that builds up in their fur which can lead to skin irritations and even dog acne. Just imagine a solution that would keep your dog’s water bowl clean and germ free….
INTRODUCING THE HERO BOWL 
The HERO Bowl is a superior alternative to stainless steel, glass or ceramic products. It is made from recyclable polypropylene and has 24-hour protection from a technology that works constantly to reduce microbes, such as bacteria, mould and fungi, by up to 99.99% on the protected surface. Like all pet bowls, the HERO Bowl should be cleaned regularly, but unlike on an unprotected bowl, the risk of microbial cross contamination from the HERO Bowl is actively reduced as the built-in BioCote® technology continues to perform against the colonisation of bacteria, perfectly complementing existing hygiene practices. We partnered with BioCote® - a world leader in proven antimicrobial technology - to bring to you the world’s most hygienic dog bowl.
DISCOVER WHAT MAKES THE HERO BOWL UNIQUE
The HERO Bowl is the most hygienic germ-busting bowl on the market and the smartest for you, your family, and your four-legged friend.

BioCote® Patented silver ions technology in action
 

 

 
SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST A BOWL... 

TESTED BY FURRY EXPERTSIn line with our core ethos to create products for dogs that keep them happy, healthy and safe, the HERO Bowl is made from recyclable polypropylene and has a tapered ergonomic design. It has a non-slip base; twin side cut outs for easy handling; a high curve interior with angular corners for easier feeding and shifting of food; and is dishwasher safe. It is available in two sizes: Small (S) 18cm / 7.08 inch (450 ML / 1.90 US Cups) and Large (L) 23 cm / 9.05 inch (1.0 Litres/ 4.23 US Cups). It will come in a range of HOWND matt brand colours with a gloss logo to suit any home decor.   WITH 25 YEARS GUARANTEED ANTIMICROBIAL PERFORMANCE THE HERO BOWL IS THE ONLY DOG BOWL YOU WILL EVER NEEDIt’s a bold statement we know! The silver ions technology is present throughout the HERO Bowl, providing protection even if it becomes scratched or is chewed by your dog. Because the antimicrobial protection cannot not wash off or wear away, it will last for the expected lifetime of the bowl. Biocote technology is proven to last 25 years! The patent-pending HERO Bowl is simply a must-have product for pet owners that care as much about their pets’ hygiene as they do their own. THE TECH BITThe BioCote® additive has been proven to reduce up to 86% of bacteria in just 15 minutes, 99.5% in two hours and has even been proven to inactivate the H1N1 virus.The technology is resistant to microbes, such as bacteria, mould and fungi, and may also prevent the formation of biofilms - a defence mechanism from certain bacteria that is a secretion of mucus which builds up until visible to the naked eye. You know, that slimy stuff lurking in your water bowl. A superior alternative to a stainless steel or ceramic products, the HERO Bowl is made from recyclable polypropylene and has 24-hour protection from a technology that works constantly to reduce microbes by up to 99.99% on the protected surface. Like all pet bowls, the HERO Bowl should be cleaned regularly, but unlike on an unprotected bowl, the risk of microbial cross contamination from the HERO Bowl is actively reduced as the BioCote® technology continues to perform against the colonization of bacteria, perfectly complementing existing hygiene practices.

They are perfect for single as well as multiple pet households, dog grooming salons, vet surgeries, rescue centers, kennels, cafes, and any place where dogs share communal bowls. Many people have told us that they wash their dogs' bowls every day, which is great. However, bacteria continue to grow and multiply as soon as the bowls come out of the wash, and our innovation literally halts the colonization of bacteria. Thank you doggy community for your support.

<p><strong>The Inspiration for Elora Doors:</strong></p>
<p>A few years ago, our travels took us to the quaint Ontario town of Elora, and on a side street I found an extraordinary privacy fence made from antique doors.  I took lots of photos and last summer, worked on a large painting inspired by this scene.</p>
<p>When I posted a photo of my work-in-progress on Facebook, I got a <i>huge</i> response, and the piece sold before the paint was dry. I realized that this image had mass appeal and deserved a wider audience, in the form of reproduced prints.</p>
<p><strong>Why Crowdfund this project?</strong></p>
<p>Throughout my career, I have produced nine series of prints (five as bulk runs of offset lithography and four as on-demand giclées). The last series was released in 2001. For an artist trying to make a living, there is a difficulty inherent in each technology.</p>
<p>With bulk runs, the unit cost is low, but I must invest in a large quantity of inventory and possibly take years to sell it off, if ever.</p>
<p>With print-on-demand products, the unit cost is high, and to get volume discounts, I again take the risk of having very expensive excess inventory.</p>
<p>My Indiegogo campaign will predict accurately how much inventory to order, and will fund the initial bulk printing, packaging, and distribution of my Elora Doors products, in a cost-effective manner.</p>

<h3>Stars &amp; Stripes Soirée</h3>
<p>Celebrate this 4th of July in style with the Stars &amp; Stripes Soirée box! Everything you need to celebrate - from near or far. Have everything delivered to your door for up to 12 guests. Or, celebrate virtually and send a box to each of your guests. We'll even include patriotic e-vites and virtual backgrounds to add to the fun!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's In The Box</h3>
<p>Each Stars &amp; Stripes Soirée box comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disposable place settings for each of your guests, incl. paper plates, bowls, napkins and plastic cutlery and glasses.</li>
<li>Festive decor: a table runner, tin pail candle holders with tea lights, a red pail vase (to add your own flowers), silver sparkler stirs, and hanging paper fans.</li>
<li>If you opt for a ""virtual party"", we'll email you a patriotic evite design and virtual backgrounds.</li>
<li>A party guide, including simple set-up instructions, hosting tips and photography tricks for an easy, post-worthy party!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Posted Party Co</h3>
<p>Posted Party is on a mission to make every at-home celebration post-worthy!  We are working hard to bring you our second holiday box offering this year. We loved hearing your feedback on our Valentine's Day Box offering - and we've used it to bring you our all-new summer celebration boxes, starting with the Stars &amp; Stripes Soirée.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Business Goals</h3>
<p>Posted Party was founded by Samantha Scinta in 2020 and was born out of many virtual events and an effort to make at-home celebrations extra special during the pandemic. Samantha's goal with Posted Party is to make at-home, post-worthy parties easy and accessible to all (especially her friends &amp; fam)! Posted Party is currently in a ""proof-of-concept"" phase. We're so excited to have you try out our brand-new celebration box concept. Posted Party is not profitable - so we are offering our boxes at the lowest price we can, while still sourcing all of the contents at lower quantities. We hope to scale to higher volumes in the future as we build out this business - and lower our prices in the process.</p>

<p><strong>CUSTOMS &amp; DUTIES INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Our prices DO NOT include VAT, GST or other country taxes.</p>
<p>Our terms of sale for international orders are FOB destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter.</p>
<p>If you would like to estimate your duties, you can use this online tool (remember to convert the U.S. dollars to your local currency):</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/</a></p>
<p>For international customers who are required to pay customs, you will receive an email from your local customs authorities asking for payment to have your order processed through customs. Unfortunately, there is no legal way around customs (including marking an order as a gift, which we cannot do). Once you make that payment to the customs broker your order will be processed for final delivery.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING POLICY</strong></p>
<p>It is critical that you enter your correct, valid address when placing your order. If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and you don't get it because you’re not there, wrong address or moved without notifying us, and the package returns back to our warehouse, it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking number, please keep an eye out for the package.</p>
<p><strong>POTENTIAL SHIPPING DELAYS</strong></p>
<p>The current timeline is to begin shipping all perks in May 2019. If we experience any unforseen delays we will notify you in a timely manner so you can plan for the contingency.</p>

</div></div>","Made of 100% platinum silicone. Virtually indestructible and endlessly reusable, these new containers will change the way you store, cook and even eat. 
  
 
 Plastic ends up in landfills where it can take hundreds of years to break down. And if the plastic doesn’t end up in a landfill, it could end up in the ocean, where it can cause pollution and marine animal deaths.

Plastic waste in the food storage industry is not only from disposable plastic bags. Most plastic storage containers are rendered useless and thrown away once their lids are lost, warped or damaged.
Zip Top® containers don’t require lids! So save your money and save the planet.
 

Traditional plastic containers are petroleum-based and can contain harmful chemicals. These toxins can leach into your food, especially when microwaving.  Every Zip Top® container is made of 100% pure platinum silicone and is completely plastic-free.
 



 
Ideal for meals on the go. Simply pull the zipper apart and you have an open dish with a wide open top. Hold your favorite salad, morning oatmeal, kid's snacks, or fruit. A great storage solution for craft supplies, like crayons. Ideal for travel, use the dish for toiletries, cords, cosmetics or snacks. 


No lids to store, lose, find, lose again, or clean!
 
T
 
The first zippered bag to stand tall and stay open. It's perfect for lunches at work, school or wherever. Best of all, this bag actually gets clean in the dishwasher with its open rounded interior.  
Goodbye, floppy bags!
 




 
Designed for versatility. Soups, chilis and sauces can all go from freezer to microwave to table. 
But don't stop there, Zip Top containers are wonderful on the go for leftovers, dry snacks, veggies, fruit, nuts, etc.
Get creative!
