<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone, my name is Cohen DeYoung. I decided about a year ago to start looking into screen printing and see what it is all about. Needless to say, I fell in love with it, and completely taught myself the basic ins-and-outs of the profession with only the help of the Internet and YouTube. I've definitely found my dream job. I started printing shirts for the band that I'm in and slowly started to print shirts for other bands as well. I want to make the big jump and make this a full time profession for myself.</p>
<p>Recently, I've started to get a lot of business, and I do have a decent little setup that I've funded myself up until now. The problem is, my equipment is not the best for producing mass quantities of shirts at a fast pace. The equipment gets too hot after a little bit of time, and it takes longer for me to cool down the equipment and shirts while printing than it actually does to create the shirt. This means it takes quite a bit of time to produce good quality prints with everything I have right now. Each print I have is created manually. I do have a day job as well (pest control), and so immediately after a full day of working outside, there I am in my humble little shop printing shirts until 2 in the morning. I then wake up at 6:30am for my day job, and repeat it all over again. I'm burning the candle at both ends, so to speak.</p>
<p>I like to keep my prices low for the printing and I have a lot of equipment upgrades that I'd like to get, but this is the main one that I need right now and the most expensive piece. I'm trying to get a new printing press that will not heat up as quickly and allow the shirts on the press to cool down, and make it possible to print more colors at a faster pace. All other upgrades I will be getting will be self funded.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The press I am trying to get is called a Vastex v2000hd 6/6. It is a manual press that will allow me to print up to six colors on a shirt, and has six shirt stations (this allows me to print five other shirts between the time that the first shirt goes under the flash dryer to become super heated to cure the ink, before coming back around for another color, giving the shirt and the equipment holding the shirt time to cool). This thing has a 25 year warranty and is built to last. It will probably be the only manual press I will need for the rest of my screen printing career. I've done my research, and this by far is the best press for the money.</p>
<p>I have some pretty cool perks for those of you that will help, please check it out!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's simple, you guys are helping one person's dream become a reality. I have always wanted to become my own boss. I've taught myself a trade and I'm learning more and more every day. This has become a true passion of mine and I plan on doing this for the rest of my life. Everyone wants to find that job they can actually enjoy doing each and every day while still feeling a sense of pride an accomplishment doing it, and this is it for me. You guys will be helping one new entrepreneur achieve his dream.</p>

Wexlers Comics wants to be THE place for all your new and back issue needs; as well as supplies, displays, and other memorabilia. Our current stock of over 2500 books ranges from the 70’s to present-day! We are also looking for new sources for all your needs and would like to become your one stop shop for Indie Comics. However, advertising and site fees are currently preventing that dream from taking shape. Ideally, we would like to be able to fund our site for at least a year, improve our product line, and allow for quality advertising to show the great potential in our product. Two weeks ago, we successfully attended our first, small local comic convention here in the Chicago land area.  In addition, we were honored to have been asked to be part of one of the newest big conventions in Chicago land in June.</p>
<p>Bringing you the best Indie Books on the market is one of our main goals. We recently have found three up and coming local Indie companies and, as we grow, so will our list. We will be reviewing these innovative new books from artwork to plot to everything in between. These partnerships may even bring out new storylines as great minds combine. So if you are in to Indie, we want to be your one stop shop.</p>
<p>Currently, all funding for the conventions and website are coming out of my own pocket. Ideally, I would like to find like-minded folks interested in how far we can take our dream. So, in order to make all this happen we have turned to our peers (Yes, that’d be you!). </p>
<p>Your funding will provide for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Site maintenance and growth for one year.</li>
<li>Add more products to our store to fill your short boxes, walls, or shelves with all your favorite super heroes, along with the hard to find Indie books that we all love.</li>
<li>We are working with a T-Shirt company to try and get shirts available at the low cost of 5 dollars a shirt, exclusively available on only two sites.</li>
<li>The lowest priced books available. All of our books are priced well below market value of the grade that we give them. We use the CPG standard in our grading to give you the best possible price. Some even say we grade harder than the CPG standard.</li>
</ol><p>In the future we will provide some of the best prints, at great prices, in addition to hard to find variants, autographed books, and even foreign issues.</p>
<p>Our site currently features three up and coming bloggers. Taryn works on comic book movies while Jeff comments on industry trends. Taryn, our movie critic, was involved in the Hollywood scene for many years and has a deep understanding and love of movies; while, Jeff, our comic book guru, has been studying the comic world for over 20 years. I will, personally, be providing you with reviews of every Indie book our site features.</p>
<p>I have been involved in the retail business for over 10 years and take pride in the fact that customer service will drive our company. It became clear that there was a hole in the comic book industry when it took me three weeks to speak to a company that I had ordered from and then another 2 weeks to receive my items. We want to get to a point where we can take any order to find certain books. Consistent networking and attending 3 to 6 conventions a year will expedite the search for that special book you have been seeking. Strong relationships with a variety of sources are being forged to allow for easy search and finding that one book that continues to elude you.</p>
<p>We understand that you are taking a leap of faith by contributing to our cause, so every contributor will receive something in return. Below you can see what is available for each pledge. We plan on having all items shipped no later than June 30th unless we have some draw backs. This should not be an issue as all Items are currently instock.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute today (the day that you first find us), please check out our website and like us on FaceBook. Also, if you can please share this with your friends and family and contacts on Facebook. This way you can keep track of what we have going on and where we are going. </p>
<p>So, if you can, please give what you can today and help out our cause. Be a part of new and fresh ideas that we feel will fill a new niche in our industry and fill your boxes with a ton of great books at great prices. So remember that any pledge that you submit guarantees you the item listed below. And you never know, if we are very successful, we may be able to add more as this drive continues. So stay tuned!!!</p>

But I’m not Forest Gump and I didn’t just ""start running…"" I’m running for a cause.</p>
<p>There is an amazing church in Santa Monica called Risen Church. For over 10 years I was looking for a place to call ""home"" and I found it here. It is unlike any other church I've been to, and part of that is because of the community found there. But more importantly, it strives to ""make disciples of Jesus who will join God in the restoration of all things."" This may sound like wild, religious talk, but it's not. It basically means that we want to see more love in this world... the really good kind of love.</p>
<p>Risen Church is trying to become independent and do awesome things in the city of Santa Monica. But [spoiler alert] we need a lot of money in order to become independent – I guess even churches have to pay rent and health insurance and stuff.</p>
<p>So I thought: <em>What if I ran a marathon as a way to help support my church? After all, Risen needs to raise over $100,000 and that’s a HUGE endeavor… almost as huge as running 26.2 miles!</em> </p>
<p>Many people run races for various causes and charities, and I’ve chosen to run for my church. If you have a few extra bucks, I’d be grateful if you’d support me in my quest to conquer the LA Marathon next month. Your contribution will not only help me remain focused and motivated, but will also help ensure that our small, little “ragamuffin” church can keep its doors open and continue helping people. Plus, all of your donation will go directly to Risen's fundraising campaign: <em>Rise Up!</em> Huzzah!</p>
<p>My goal may seem a little high (at least it does to me), but I like to aim for the moon. I’d love to raise $2,620, which is $100 per mile (not that you have to donate that much, though I'd kiss ya if you did). And if you're thinking, ""$100 per mile sounds ridiculous"", well, just think about running 26.2 miles. Now THAT'S ridiculous!</p>
<p>A few bucks go a LONG way, so even $5 or $10 would be greatnly appreciated. And if you're like my family and are shocked that I'll be running that many miles, then please throw down a little extra. Again, it's ALL going to a wonderful cause!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for helping me find the courage to do the insane and for your support in ensuring that Risen Church can continue to do incredible things. And take heart in knowing that when a short, crazy-haired, young man (me) crosses the Finish Line, it will largely be because of YOUR support. :)</p></div>","My name is Jason Palmer and I am now a runner. I used to hate running, probably because I was forced to do it in school, but now that I choose to run, I find that I love it. On March 17th, 2013, I will be putting my joy of running to the test as I attempt my very first marathon. But I’m not Forest Gump and I didn’t just ""start running…"" I’m running for a cause.
There is an amazing church in Santa Monica called Risen Church. For over 10 years I was looking for a place to call ""home"" and I found it here. It is unlike any other church I've been to, and part of that is because of the community found there. But more importantly, it strives to ""make disciples of Jesus who will join God in the restoration of all things."" This may sound like wild, religious talk, but it's not. It basically means that we want to see more love in this world... the really good kind of love.
Risen Church is trying to become independent and do awesome things in the city of Santa Monica. But [spoiler alert] we need a lot of money in order to become independent – I guess even churches have to pay rent and health insurance and stuff.
So I thought: What if I ran a marathon as a way to help support my church? After all, Risen needs to raise over $100,000 and that’s a HUGE endeavor… almost as huge as running 26.2 miles! 
Many people run races for various causes and charities, and I’ve chosen to run for my church. If you have a few extra bucks, I’d be grateful if you’d support me in my quest to conquer the LA Marathon next month. Your contribution will not only help me remain focused and motivated, but will also help ensure that our small, little “ragamuffin” church can keep its doors open and continue helping people. Plus, all of your donation will go directly to Risen's fundraising campaign: Rise Up! Huzzah!
My goal may seem a little high (at least it does to me), but I like to aim for the moon. I’d love to raise $2,620, which is $100 per mile (not that you have to donate that much, though I'd kiss ya if you did). And if you're thinking, ""$100 per mile sounds ridiculous"", well, just think about running 26.2 miles. Now THAT'S ridiculous!
A few bucks go a LONG way, so even $5 or $10 would be greatnly appreciated. And if you're like my family and are shocked that I'll be running that many miles, then please throw down a little extra. Again, it's ALL going to a wonderful cause!
Thanks in advance for helping me find the courage to do the insane and for your support in ensuring that Risen Church can continue to do incredible things. And take heart in knowing that when a short, crazy-haired, young man (me) crosses the Finish Line, it will largely be because of YOUR support. :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>The History, the Project and the Problem</strong></h3>
<p>Jasmine's childhood was as rough as they come, gowing up in a poor, rural Cambodian village.  She had no dad, she scavenged rubbish for a living as a four-year-old, she was chased out of roadside shack-restaurants for trying to scavenge food, pot-bellied with malnutrition.  She nursed her beloved mother to a death from AIDS, sometimes finding her in her own defecation and covered in ants.  She was sold off as an orphan to be used as a pre-pubescent sex toy.  It all went down hill from there.</p>
<p>Owen was born in Daru, an island off Papua New Guinea and raised in Perth, Australia.  He had a rural-urban middle-class upbringing, and has always been something of an artist-come-eccentric, affectionately referred to in one review as ""a real life eco-Willy Wonka"".  His projects have often involved community and social responsibility in one way or another, whether it be with Aboriginal Australians, victims of the devastating Boxing-Day-Tsunami in Aceh, or poor Cambodians. </p>
<p>Owen and Jasmine married in 2008, and were working towards one day building an eco-resort that would not only be a wonderful place to live, but would also benefit poor Cambodians. They didn't have enough cash yet, and Owen had been offered a well-paid job if he had an English teaching certificate so went to Phuket to train for a couple of weeks.  While there he met an old man who was also there looking for a change of career.  Owen looked out for him, and they spent quite a bit of the ‘spare time’ together during the course. About a week in, the old guy asked Owen if he had any ideas for a project that might be good for some poor Cambodians, and he told him about the Jasmine Valley project, which he was working towards. The old fellow offered to finance it so it could happen more quickly – an offer Owen initially turned down because the risk of business in Cambodia is high, and it would be crazy to borrow for such a project. The old guy insisted that this wasn’t a ‘loan’ as such, but that Owen should reinvest everything back into the project for the first years, then only pay him back if he’s still alive when Jasmine Valley is making good money.<br/><br/> This all seemed too good to be true, but the old guy assured Owen there were many rich Americans looking for philanthropic opportunities; people who didn’t want to “just will their money to the university”. He said he had already given his sons houses and they didn’t need any more money. He also said that he’d lost a million dollars in the Global Financial Crisis, and would prefer to risk losing money on a project that would be good for people in need.<br/><br/> So, they agreed. Owen asked that they put things in writing, and the old man insisted it be a gentleman’s agreement, and that we just shake hands. With that, Owen shook his hand and promised he would do his best, but that was all he could promise.<br/><br/> As things panned out, Owen received an inheritance and sold his house, all of which he committed to the project, so with the combined moneys and a great deal of very hard work Owen and Jasmine built an eco-resort that is currently still functioning as a social enterprise helping young, very undereducated, very poor Cambodians.<br/><br/> As time ticked by and the old guy spent extended periods of time in Cambodia, it became clear that he very much enjoyed the company of 'the ladies', and he consistently asked to be taken a small disco that was running in town during his first visit. These places are where one can pay a couple of dollars to a cute 16 year old girl and she’ll sit on your lap for a couple of hours – not an appropriate place for them to take the old man, whether he wanted girls to sit on his lap or not, especially given that they were a small family-oriented business in a small down.  There was then a complaint about sexual harassment from an employee of the old man’s – he had decided to set up his own project and had one young Cambodian woman working for him by then.<br/><br/> Jasmine Valley Eco-Resort is a family friendly resort. Many of the clients are NGO workers fighting the child-sex-trade in Cambodia. Others are missionaries and the like. It was very problematic, and once they had what they considered a serious complaint, Owen was professionally and ethically obliged to raise it with the old man. If he didn’t, Jasmine Valley (and Owen and Jasmine personally) would have likely gained a very unsavoury reputation, as Kep, and even Cambodia, is a very small community. It could well have destroyed them.<br/><br/>They felt very conflicted because of their financial relationship with the old man and their duty to confront him, but Owen raised the complaint with him and he became very angry. He then proceeded to meet with Owen's colleagues and their families to tell them that Owen had stolen his money and intended to steal more. Nothing could be further from the truth, but it seems he had successfully convinced himself of things he needed to believe in order to begin making real trouble for Owen and Jasmine. </p>
<p>And there was trouble.<br/><br/> To cut a long story short, the old man has demanded that Owen and Jasmine return his money, plus 12% pa interest. Of course, they didn’t have the financial resources to do that, because it had all been used to create Jasmine Valley Eco-Resort.  They have made several offers in good faith to give him the money back over time, but he has refused all offers and has taken them to court in a country where ‘money talks’. He would be laughed out of court in America or Australia. He has asked the court to sell everything Jasmine and Owen own and give him the money. Incidentally, the old man recently made an offer outside the court. It would have been very difficult for them to service, but they accepted nevertheless in order to stop this ridiculous conflict. He then retracted his offer, for no apparent reason, as they walked into the court. It appears to be a game for him.</p>
<p>The court has made the decision that Owen and Jasmine will have to pay the old man $230,000 (about $40,000 more than the actual amount, since he submitted to the court a bank transfer from himself to himself, saying it was as a transfer to Owen - bizarre!) by March 2012 or have their property auctioned off.  Owen and Jasmine will appeal, but the net result, should they eventually go through the whole court system, and should the high court eventually decide to grant the old man his wish, would be that Jasmine and Owen, and their children, lose everything they own. </p>
<p>In good faith, Jasmine and Owen have made the old man offers to pay him out over time, but he refuses anything that’s actually doable. They have also offered to sell Jasmine Valley Eco-Resort and give him his money, but the old man has put an injunction on the property to it can't be sold.</p>
<p>Our fundraiser is a desperate attempt to raise the money needed to move the old man on.  To save Jasmine Valley Eco-Resort.  We don't feel great about fundraising for something 'personal', so have pledged the funds we raise to a charity working in Cambodia, in the event that we possibly sell in the future.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Wow!! Look what I got!</span></h3>
<h3><strong>What it's all about</strong></h3>
<p class=""western""><strong>Simple version - We're starting a radically different new fine-art publishing business - When customers subscribe for £5 a month or £50 a year, we send them a fine-art print of one of our artworks <span>every month!</span> We're running this project to raise the money to buy the equipment to get started.</strong></p>
<p class=""western""><a href=""http://wowlookwhatigot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""wowlookwhatigot.com - website"">wowlookwhatigot.com</a> is two artists, <a href=""http://wowlookwhatigot.com/WOWabout.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""About Martin &amp; Vivi-Mari"">Martin Herbert and Vivi-Mari Carpelan</a>, from Britain and Finland respectively, who married in 2010 and currently live and work in Mid-Wales in the UK. We are two creative people who are being stifled by lack of opportunity and we intend to fix that.<img alt='""The Heart is the Fountain of Wisdom"" : Ink &amp; pencil on handmade paper : Copyright © 2012 by Martin Herbert' class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://wowlookwhatigot.com/gfx/art/MHfountain.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 12px;"" title='""The Heart is the Fountain of Wisdom"" : Ink &amp; pencil on handmade paper : Copyright © 2012 by Martin Herbert'/></p>
<p class=""western"">It would be tempting at this point to say something like ""It's increasingly difficult to make a living as an artist in the current economic climate"", but actually that's not true. It doesn't go nearly far enough. It's actually pretty much impossible unless you're one of the elite few favored by the big galleries. The result is that we're scrabbling around to find enough money to buy food at the end of the month. I mean, yeah, you gotta suffer for your art, man, but enough's enough, OK?</p>
<p class=""western"">No point sitting round wingeing about it - time to get up and do something. On the one hand we have artists desperate to sell some creative work (that would be us!) and on the other we have people who love art but can't afford to buy it (and maybe that's you!). Our idea is to bring the two together by creating a new kind of art market where each month, for a low price subscription (like a magazine), people get a new, thought provoking, unusual piece of artwork - the sort of thing, in fact, that makes you want to show your friends and say ""Wow! Look what I got this month!"" Our byline will be ""Build an art collection for only £5 a month!"".</p>
<p class=""western"">The main object of this campaign is to raise the money to buy a production-quality large format printer to use in our project. The more we raise the more efficient our creative process is going to be. Your help could help give us the freedom to carry on creating art without constantly worrying about where the money to pay the next bill is coming from, so please contribute to the project, and we promise you'll get some fabulous art in return!</p>
<h3 class=""western""><strong>What we need from you (the crowd!)</strong></h3>
<p class=""western""><img alt='""Loose Promises"" : Handmade collage : Copyright © 2008 by Vivi-Mari Carpelan' class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://wowlookwhatigot.com/gfx/art/VMpromises.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 12px; float: left;"" title='""Loose Promises"" : Handmade collage : Copyright © 2008 by Vivi-Mari Carpelan'/>Ideally we want to raise £5000 – that's around $8000. It will buy a high quality fast large-format digital giclée printer and other equipment and materials we need to produce the best possible fine-art prints to send to our subscribers. So we're turning to you to ask for contributions. Even if you don't want the art landing on your mat, the minimum contribution is only $1 (about 70p) 'cos every bit helps! Larger contributions mean you get more art - simple, huh?</p>
<h3 class=""western""><strong>What you get from us - perks that keep on giving!</strong></h3>
<p class=""western"">First off, let's make it clear - by contributing to the project you are not signing up for a membership, a subscription, or any kind of repeat billing. For the basic contribution of $8 (£5)* we'll send you one sample fine-art print, then a second month's piece free. Then, and only then, we'll ask if you're sufficiently impressed to want to take out regular membership of wowlookwhatigot.com and get a new piece of art every month. Please take a look at the other 'perks' - for a campaign contribution of as little as $75* you could have more than a year's worth of art!<br/>(Currency exchange: Note $1 is approximately 70p (UK) or 0.80€ ) **</p>
<p class=""western"">To show you the kind of thing we'll be sending there are lots of links below to our <a href=""http://wowlookwhatigot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Open the website in another window"">website</a>, <a href=""http://wowlookwhatigot.blogspot.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Open the blog in a new window"">blog</a>, and a whole <a href=""http://wowlookwhatigot.com/WOWgallery.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Open the gallery in a new window"">gallery</a> of artwork. We're planning to start with a basic format of an A5 sized print of our own artwork, but we'll vary things with commissions from other artists, posters, trading cards, maybe even DVDs of video art! The possibilities are endless - that's what makes it such an exciting project for us and, we hope, for you. Please take a good look around - as the campaign goes on we'll be posting links to more work, our personal blogs and websites etc, so you can get to know us better.</p>
<p class=""western"">I almost forgot to mention the best thing... for any contribution, even just $1 to show you like us, you get on the newsletter mailing list, which gives you invitations to exhibition private views, news of auctions of our original art, future membership offers, and details of other events - anything we can think of, in fact, that will make art more exciting!</p>
<h3 class=""western""><strong>Make a gift of art!</strong></h3>
<p class=""western"">Our 'Hockney', 'Picasso', 'da Vinci' or 'Rafael' perks make fabulous gifts for a loved one. If you'd like to make a contribution and give your perk as a gift to someone else, please let us know by email (<a href=""mailto:info@wowlookwhatigot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Clcik here to open your mail client, or copy and paste into a mail header"">info@wowlookwhatigot.com</a>) when you've completed checkout and we'll send you a gift card and get the address where we need to send the art.</p>
<h3 class=""western""><strong>What if it all goes pear-shaped, guv?</strong></h3>
<p class=""western"">If we don't reach our goal then we may still have enough to do things on a smaller scale. A few hundred pounds will enable us to get a smaller second-hand giclée printer and allow us to get our art out of the door and on people's walls! The whole idea is to enable us to get art to people, and we'll do it to the best of our ability. In the event we just don't raise enough money to be useful then of course everyone gets their contributions back, but please understand we have to pay around 10% costs (indiegogo and PayPal commissions, for instance) so we may not be able to quite return 100%.</p>
<p class=""western"">On the other hand, if we raise more than our target, we'll be able to buy bigger, better and faster printing equipment, more materials, etc. We may be able to contract out delivery to a bulk mailing compnay, freeing up more of our time for actually creating art, maybe even pay advance rent on a studio and production space - don't worry - the money will go into making a more sustainable future for us as artists.</p>

Simple version - We're starting a radically different new fine-art publishing business - When customers subscribe for £5 a month or £50 a year, we send them a fine-art print of one of our artworks every month! We're running this project to raise the money to buy the equipment to get started.
wowlookwhatigot.com is two artists, Martin Herbert and Vivi-Mari Carpelan, from Britain and Finland respectively, who married in 2010 and currently live and work in Mid-Wales in the UK. We are two creative people who are being stifled by lack of opportunity and we intend to fix that.
It would be tempting at this point to say something like ""It's increasingly difficult to make a living as an artist in the current economic climate"", but actually that's not true. It doesn't go nearly far enough. It's actually pretty much impossible unless you're one of the elite few favored by the big galleries. The result is that we're scrabbling around to find enough money to buy food at the end of the month. I mean, yeah, you gotta suffer for your art, man, but enough's enough, OK?
No point sitting round wingeing about it - time to get up and do something. On the one hand we have artists desperate to sell some creative work (that would be us!) and on the other we have people who love art but can't afford to buy it (and maybe that's you!). Our idea is to bring the two together by creating a new kind of art market where each month, for a low price subscription (like a magazine), people get a new, thought provoking, unusual piece of artwork - the sort of thing, in fact, that makes you want to show your friends and say ""Wow! Look what I got this month!"" Our byline will be ""Build an art collection for only £5 a month!"".
The main object of this campaign is to raise the money to buy a production-quality large format printer to use in our project. The more we raise the more efficient our creative process is going to be. Your help could help give us the freedom to carry on creating art without constantly worrying about where the money to pay the next bill is coming from, so please contribute to the project, and we promise you'll get some fabulous art in return!
What we need from you (the crowd!)
Ideally we want to raise £5000 – that's around $8000. It will buy a high quality fast large-format digital giclée printer and other equipment and materials we need to produce the best possible fine-art prints to send to our subscribers. So we're turning to you to ask for contributions. Even if you don't want the art landing on your mat, the minimum contribution is only $1 (about 70p) 'cos every bit helps! Larger contributions mean you get more art - simple, huh?
What you get from us - perks that keep on giving!
First off, let's make it clear - by contributing to the project you are not signing up for a membership, a subscription, or any kind of repeat billing. For the basic contribution of $8 (£5)* we'll send you one sample fine-art print, then a second month's piece free. Then, and only then, we'll ask if you're sufficiently impressed to want to take out regular membership of wowlookwhatigot.com and get a new piece of art every month. Please take a look at the other 'perks' - for a campaign contribution of as little as $75* you could have more than a year's worth of art!(Currency exchange: Note $1 is approximately 70p (UK) or 0.80€ ) **
To show you the kind of thing we'll be sending there are lots of links below to our website, blog, and a whole gallery of artwork. We're planning to start with a basic format of an A5 sized print of our own artwork, but we'll vary things with commissions from other artists, posters, trading cards, maybe even DVDs of video art! The possibilities are endless - that's what makes it such an exciting project for us and, we hope, for you. Please take a good look around - as the campaign goes on we'll be posting links to more work, our personal blogs and websites etc, so you can get to know us better.
I almost forgot to mention the best thing... for any contribution, even just $1 to show you like us, you get on the newsletter mailing list, which gives you invitations to exhibition private views, news of auctions of our original art, future membership offers, and details of other events - anything we can think of, in fact, that will make art more exciting!
Make a gift of art!
Our 'Hockney', 'Picasso', 'da Vinci' or 'Rafael' perks make fabulous gifts for a loved one. If you'd like to make a contribution and give your perk as a gift to someone else, please let us know by email (info@wowlookwhatigot.com) when you've completed checkout and we'll send you a gift card and get the address where we need to send the art.
What if it all goes pear-shaped, guv?
If we don't reach our goal then we may still have enough to do things on a smaller scale. A few hundred pounds will enable us to get a smaller second-hand giclée printer and allow us to get our art out of the door and on people's walls! The whole idea is to enable us to get art to people, and we'll do it to the best of our ability. In the event we just don't raise enough money to be useful then of course everyone gets their contributions back, but please understand we have to pay around 10% costs (indiegogo and PayPal commissions, for instance) so we may not be able to quite return 100%.
On the other hand, if we raise more than our target, we'll be able to buy bigger, better and faster printing equipment, more materials, etc. We may be able to contract out delivery to a bulk mailing compnay, freeing up more of our time for actually creating art, maybe even pay advance rent on a studio and production space - don't worry - the money will go into making a more sustainable future for us as artists.

So what else?
There's one more thing we would ask of you. Please SHARE! The only way we will raise the money we need for the project is if not hundreds, but thousands, nay - hundreds of thousands of people come here and read this. There are buttons just underneath the campaign video at the top of this page which you can use to share our campaign on social media or email it directly to someone. Please, don't only tell your friends, but beg them to tell their friends, and so on... If you contribute, or if you sign up for the newsletter on our website then you'll get regular updates during the campaign that you can forward to anyone you think may be interested. Remember - Donate & share!
Note: If you just can't contribute to the campaign right now, but you'd like to keep in touch with what's going on anyway, you can sign up for the newletter by clicking here.
* - please note there is a small extra cost for international shipping. Please add at checkout as requested in the perk details.

<h3>The Big Green T-Shirt Printing Expriment</h3>
<p>(<strong>TL;DR</strong> if you pledge more I'll print with green materials)</p>
<p>I'd like to print on Recycled scrap cotton, recycled plastic bottle, hemp and other green t-shirts using discharge water-based ink and every possible green practice that I can figure out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, going green is expensive. Operating costs are easily twice that of more normal industry practices.</p>
<p>Most of the t-shirts you see and own were printed on on Fruit of the Loom, Sanmar, Gilden, and Port and Co shirts with plasticol ink.  The people who print those shirts,  98% of all screenprinters, feel that's the only way to keep the price down low enough to be competitive.</p>
<p>However I would to like explore the green niche in the market: I feel like there are enough t-shirt buyers out there who are willing to spend extra for green practices that Sunny Days could be successful as a green screenprinter.</p>
<p>But maybe not.  I'd like to try this experiment:</p>
<h3>Normal Tier, Green Tier</h3>
<p>If Sunny Days reaches it's $1200 goal or less (That's 48 shirts at $25 per shirt) then I'll print the shirts with normal industry practices.</p>
<p>If Sunny Days reaches $2000 (with around 50% or more pledgers donating more then $25 per shirt) I'll go green and print on recycled or hemp shirts with discharge ink.</p>
<p>The big difference is that I already own the normal ink; it came with the press.  But I'll have to buy the discharge ink and the more expensive shirts.</p>
<p>Why not just go all green and print fewer shirts?  Because using the shirts as an advertising tool is absolutely necessary to gain a client base, the bigger the better. Printing a lot of shirts is essential to make the business work out.</p>
<h3>Softer ink</h3>
<p>Plasticol ink is the usual ink for screenprinting; it has a slightly rubbery feel, or if layered up for many colors, a thick rubbery feel that screenprinters call ""bulletproof"". Water based discharge ink is much, much softer.  So pledge more and get softer shirts.</p>
<h3>So Pledge!</h3>
<p>And thank you so much for doing it.  The money goes to bootstrapping Sunny Days Screenprinting into existence as my hobby business and hopefully, someday, as my real business.  Specifically the money will go into printing as many of Alameda Sun shirts as I can:  I'll give those shirts to great potential clients in order to build a client base here in Alameda.</p></div>","Thank you for getting Sunny Days Screenprinting started!

<div>My name is Samantha Ridley.  After tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan my husband started showing signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  He tried to get help on his own but was unsuccessful.  He was then sent to treatment for alcoholism,   The treatment facility he was sent to was full of addicts from a different walk of life. Many of whom lived in half-way houses and were struggling to maintain the most basic necessities of life.  My husband, being a successful military officer was often asked in his group sessions,  ""why are you even here?""  None of them were veterans and they just did not understand.  This is when we came up with the idea for the Circle of Veterans.  We want to create a place where our veterans and their families can commune and heal together.  Our counselors are passionate about what they do, and they understand the problem.</div>
<div>Without more programs like this, America could not see the epidemic among military families such as the suicide rate--22 servicemen per day.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our programs include mental health professionals, healthy living instructors, urban gardening classes among other things.  We use animals in treatment such as horse therapy and service dogs for our families.</p>
<p>My husband and I have made it to this point on our own financially, but will be needing help with funding.  Unfortunately, most grants and loans require you to be in business already before they supply the funds.  We have found the farm home that is perfect for The Circle Veterans, and we are in the process of purchasing it.</p>
<p>Where we need your help:  </p>

</div> <p>Thank you very much for you time and consideration.</p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Samantha Ridley.  After tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan my husband started showing signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  He tried to get help on his own but was unsuccessful.  He was then sent to treatment for alcoholism,   The treatment facility he was sent to was full of addicts from a different walk of life. Many of whom lived in half-way houses and were struggling to maintain the most basic necessities of life.  My husband, being a successful military officer was often asked in his group sessions,  ""why are you even here?""  None of them were veterans and they just did not understand.  This is when we came up with the idea for the Circle of Veterans.  We want to create a place where our veterans and their families can commune and heal together.  Our counselors are passionate about what they do, and they understand the problem.
Without more programs like this, America could not see the epidemic among military families such as the suicide rate--22 servicemen per day.   What We Need & What You Get Our programs include mental health professionals, healthy living instructors, urban gardening classes among other things.  We use animals in treatment such as horse therapy and service dogs for our families.
My husband and I have made it to this point on our own financially, but will be needing help with funding.  Unfortunately, most grants and loans require you to be in business already before they supply the funds.  We have found the farm home that is perfect for The Circle Veterans, and we are in the process of purchasing it.
Where we need your help:  
Therapies - Not all of our veterans and their families will have insurance or be compatible with the insurance our doctors accept.  They are passionate about what they do, but they can't work for free.
Animals - The cost of veterinarian care, food, fencing, etc. to care for the horses and service dogs can cost up to several thousand dollars.
Food - Our goal is to eventually grow our own food in our aquaponic gardens to be prepared daily in our kitchen.  However, initially we will cater the food at the cost of about $60 per day for a family of 4.  We intend to treat 2 families per week.
Farm hands and construction - The farm will be just as much therapy for us as it is for our veterans, but we have spent nearly 20 years as a military family and know nothing about raising farm animals... for now.  We will also need to modify the home to make it wheelchair accessible.

<h3>Our Story</h3>Michael came out when he was in high school.  He grew up with the people
 around him telling him what gay was.  Because of that he had a warped 
perception of what it meant to be gay. The first image is what he 
thought it meant if you were gay.  The second images is what being gay 
means to him now.<br/><br/><p>“I really thought that being gay just in itself would be hard. God 
hates you, according to some. Society fears you – because you don’t fit 
into their expectations. You get called names like “Faggot! Queer! 
Freak!” Your family can’t even look at you because they’re ashamed…or 
annoyed…or both. It’s the one taboo subject; that white elephant in the 
room, which never gets discussed. That’s a lot of pressure; yet, it’s so
 much more than that. It is the idea that you always have to look over 
your shoulder; that there is this unconscious, unspoken fear to be on 
the defensive; it’s about learning who you can trust – and it’s about 
the true disappointment when you discover that the ones you’re supposed 
to rely on abandon their responsibilities. </p>
<p>The funny thing was, I didn’t understand being gay myself so it was 
really difficult to help others understand it as well. As it was, I 
didn’t have any answers for anyone, not even myself. It took me several 
years to even know what to call it. Growing up, hitting puberty, 
understanding the changes in my body. I just knew I was different than 
anyone else. The other boys I hung out with were looking at girls….but I
 was looking at the other boys.</p>
<p>I wanted to feel accepted…feel alive!</p>
<p>I spent every day hating myself, finding ways to escape who I was. I 
couldn’t even look at myself in the mirror because there was this 
“other” person staring back at me. I considered suicide every day 
because I thought it would be easier to do that than admit who I was. I 
couldn’t turn my back on all of that anymore. I had to come out. I 
wanted respect from other people more than anything. I didn’t think that
 was asking too much. Besides, it’s not like I threw it in anyone’s 
face. So why did I have to edit my life for those who were…who still are
 uncomfortable with it? I was really one person with two identities: me,
 the person and me, the gay man. What I wanted were people to be able to
 distinguish the difference between the two and see that I was just like
 everyone else. I didn’t ask for this. Although the way people acted you
 would’ve thought my being gay was a personal attack against them. That 
doesn’t even make sense – but it’s true. It’s like this: I love men! – 
That’s the simple truth – the way they look, the way they smell…even the
 way they feel. I wish I knew the words to describe these feelings. I 
have such ansias; such nervous tension, almost like the anxiety a young 
child feels the night before Christmas: the rush of excitement and 
innocent pleasure in the anticipation of the first ray of sun that 
signals the new day.</p>
<p>You know the feeling you get in your stomach when you drop suddenly? 
That happens when I see a masculine face with beautiful brown eyes look 
at me, or when their hand reaches for my cheek to caress it; or my heart
 stops right before they step in for the first kiss; or how my palms 
sweat profusely and I switch from one foot to the other when I am brave 
enough to ask an attractive man out on a date. How can I capture the 
essence of both the sorrow and joy of that love I feel to someone who 
only sees me with an abhorrent disgust in their heart? Hatred caused 
from their own deceitful fear – which have this self-obligated obsession
 to reprimand me with their own morals…when they themselves suffer just 
as I do. You can’t. It’s hypocrisy. Yet as a gay man I was relegated to 
an object that needed to be destroyed. </p>
<p>And I understand that less than I understand being gay.”</p>

</div><div><br/></div><div>Since the early 1900's Christian missionaries started to take notice and began sending people over there to help. This has not only resulted in a major growth of Christianity in the Congo, but it has also helped the people of the Congo build a higher standard of living.

So, please pray for us and pray often as we'll definitely need all that we can get. </div><div><br/></div><div>Secondly, it's not cheap to fly all the way across the world, so any donations that you can give will help us with the expenses that our church has to pay to make this mission trip happen. Just to give you an idea of how much it costs, we just booked our 2 tickets to the Congo and together it cost right around $4,000 (which is what we're trying to raise online). There are other costs involved, too but the plane tickets are definitely the biggest chunk of change we need to help cover. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><h3>

This has not only resulted in a major growth of Christianity in the Congo, but it has also helped the people of the Congo build a higher standard of living. Obviously they still have a long way to go before they have a sustainable, safe and healthy way of life, but through this help from mission-based organizations such as The Paul Carlson Partnership and churches like ours it can only get better. In fact, the missionaries and local church leaders have done such an awesome job building up the area of the Congo where we'll be traveling, the Congolese government has given them full authority to manage most of the foundational services like hospitals, schools and orphanages. Our plan is to help them out any way that we can with what they've already accomplished so far.  Why We Need Your HelpFirst and foremost we need your prayers while we're over there in the Congo. As long as we have a group of people praying for our safety, success and motivation everything else will fall into place. So, please pray for us and pray often as we'll definitely need all that we can get. Secondly, it's not cheap to fly all the way across the world, so any donations that you can give will help us with the expenses that our church has to pay to make this mission trip happen. Just to give you an idea of how much it costs, we just booked our 2 tickets to the Congo and together it cost right around $4,000 (which is what we're trying to raise online). There are other costs involved, too but the plane tickets are definitely the biggest chunk of change we need to help cover.

We met in 2008 when we were deploying to Iraq, and we have been great friends ever since. When we returned from overseas, we saw that the economy had plummeted. Everything was different from when we left; it was harder to find and keep employment for everyone. So, we had been searching constantly for the right business venture to embark on together; since we know that if we can go to war together, we would definitely be able to run a business together.</p>
<p>We finally found the right opportunity: a Restaurant Marketing and Delivery service. We officially opened Express Waiter in September 2011 in the Dallas/ Ft worth area. Having our business has been a dream come true for the both of us!  We have had many bumps in the road to entrepreneurship, but we wouldn’t change it for the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</p>
<p>Since we have started our business, we have been funding everything for Express Waiter from our Active Duty paychecks. And we have met many people that help us out of the kindness of their hearts. One of our employees, for example, has worked for us for FREE the entire time we have been open, simply because she believes in us and our business. We try our hardest to provide for her everything she and her daughter needs for day to day life, but we’re sure that she would love to get paid. We really would love to show our gratitude for Amber and all the things she has done for us, so a portion of the money we receive in this campaign will go towards Amber and her selfless dedication to our business.</p>
<p>We would also utilize the money from this campaign to fund additional advertising and various business expenses. We need to print Menu Guides, Menu Cards and different print materials to send out to our customers to promote Express Waiter.  We have been paying for everything so far ourselves, but we just need a little help.</p>
<p>When you donate to our campaign, we will show our appreciation with lots of military memorabilia.</p>
<p>THE IMPACT</p>
<p>When we started our business, we sought out all the veterans benefits we were told were available to us, however, we found that those benefits weren’t as easily attainable as we thought. So, we want to make sure our business is a success so that we can spread the word to other veterans as to how they can start a successful business with or without veterans’ benefits. With a 12% unemployment rate for veterans who come home from deployments, we want to minimize that number and show them that they can be successful.</p>
<p>With our business, we also want to bring awareness to the Restaurant Marketing and Delivery Industry, because there are MANY companies like ours around the country. No longer are you limited to only Pizza or Chinese for delivery! We want customers and restaurants to know about the quality, convenience and variety that services like ours provide.</p>
<p> OTHER WAYS YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE</p>
<p>If you can’t contribute with money, no problem! All we ask is that you spread the word via Facebook, Twitter, email, YouTube, or however you choose! Just get the word out to help not only our campaign, but other deserving campaigns on Indiegogo. Thanks for all your support! HOOAH!!</p>

<p>There are more than 8,000 births to teenagers in Indiana every year. 7% of all teen girls in the United States will give birth before they turn 20. The problems and challenges that affect teen parents are tremendous:</p>
<p>-Only 40 percent of teen moms ever finish high school and less than two percent finish college by age 30.</p>
<p>-Teen moms are more likely to experience unemployment and live in poverty; to be depressed later in life; and to be single parents.</p>
<p>-Children of teen mothers are 50 percent more likely to repeat a grade, less likely to complete high school, and have lower performance on standardized tests than those born to older parents.</p>
<p>-A child’s chance of growing up in poverty is nine times greater if the parents were unmarried and the mother did not receive a high school diploma - both common among teen mothers.</p>
<p> One of the most significant challenges facing teen mothers is completing high school. Without the support and skills to balance both motherhood and schoolwork, it becomes difficult for teen mothers to focus on their education, which is why only 40 percent of teen mothers ever finish high school. They are more likely than other mothers to experience unemployment and live in poverty.</p>

<p>We need a minimum of $10,000 to be able to get the full impact from a $10,000 grant that we have received to buy equipment and supplies. What we offer to you is the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of both teen parents and their children. Research says that there is a $14.00 return to the community for every dollar spent on early childhood education. That means that this $10,000 could boost the local, state and national economy by $140,000. You can know for certain that your contribution will make changes in the lives of the participants - both parents and children.</p>

<p>CRADLES of Clay County is a replication of the CRADLES ministry that was started in Henry County, Indiana 15 years ago.

<p>CRADLES of Clay County envisions student parents taking their place in local communities as self-sufficient citizens within healthy family units. CRADLES will support student parents pursuing an education by providing developmentally appropriate childcare, parenting and life skills education, and mentoring.

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The greatest risk that we face is that another generation of teen parents - both mothers and fathers - will transition into adulthood without enough support to be successful in parenting and in life.</p>
<p>One of the challenges that we face is needing to raise more funds than what we envisioned when we started this process. Most of our teen parents are eligible for a childcare voucher which would help them pay for the developmentally appropriate childcare that will be provided by CRADLES of Clay County but the State of Indiana has recently frozen those funds and our commitment is that our teen parents will only pay $10 a week for the childcare provide.

<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm in Brentwood, California now helping the First Generation Farmers. We are a community farm set up so that anyone can come out and learn about organic farming and take home free produce. We do a farmers market in Brentwood every weekend where you pay what you can afford for food. It's all donation based.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm trying to get a job with Vail Ski Resorts in South Lake Tahoe for the winter to make some money back to be able to continue to volunteer across the country in 2015. I am running out of money but have an interview over the phone  with them October 1st! Unfortunately employee housing may already be filled and I will likely have to return home to Ohio to search for work this winter. If I can get enough funding through this campaign I will be able to visit my mother for the holidays and return to North Fork to work with the Kerns again this spring. </div>

</h3>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The A3 Vertical Grow System can be built to Hydroponics and Aquaponics specifications. </li>
<li>The A3 Vertical Grow System can serve farmers all over the world, and also fight world hunger.</li>
<li>The A3 Vertical Grow System is currently patent pending.</li>
<li>The A3 Vertical Grow System specializes in maximizing the seasonal output by allowing 3-4 additional harvests.</li>
<li>The A3 Vertical Grow System increases harvest 10X compared to traditional farming methods.</li>
<li>Water is cycled in the system and is reused which means daily watering is not needed. </li>
<li>Each Aquaponics A3 System allows for approximately 1000 fish to be farmed.</li>
<li>Each A3 System only requires labor for set up and crop harvest.</li>
<li>The A3 Vertical Grow System can grow, but not limited to the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>oBulb Type Plants</li>
<ul>
<li>♣Tulips</li>
<li>♣Dahlias</li>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;"">We currently have one row up and running on a 100 acre farm land in Longmont, Colorado. However we have a few goals we want to achieve. If we can make it through each of these goals we will prove the following:</span></h3>
</div><div>
<br/><ol>
<li>That the pump can effectively generate water flow to up to at least <b>Three </b>of our vertical rows so that the plants can receive sufficient nutrients and hydration.</li>
<li>That the Vertical Grow system is effective in fall and winter. We wish to prove we can grow vegetables under 50 degree weather without losing more than 10% crop. If we can achieve growing in 20 degree weather we can guarantee certain regions of the USA and other parts of the world can farm outdoors <b>All Year Round!</b>
</li>
<li>That the heat trace works, and the A3 Vertical Grow System can effectively work in freezing temperatures.</li>
<li>That the A3 Vertical Grow System requires roughly 1/4 of the personnel to harvest and maintain the system on a larger scale compared to traditional farming methods.</li>
<li>That the frame can be made out of stainless steel for durability and longevity.</li>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></h3>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need</span><br/>
</h3> <p>In order to build 5 more rows we will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class 200 PVC</li>
<li>Specialized Pump</li>
<li>Fittings</li>
<li>Hose Clamps</li>
<li>Concrete</li>

<li>Generator</li>
<li>Plant cups</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <br/>Leo Tek Inc. is trying to change the agriculture game. We have successfully utilized the one row we have built and working to grow 311 heads of lettuce. Currently we are trying the system with Lemon Basil and Purple Basil. With each test we are realizing that we are able to grow roughly 10x more in the same space that ""conventional farming"" allows for. We also know we can harvest an additional 3-4 times per season than ""conventional farming"". Further more, we actually have 10% <b>more</b> water return in the summer months in our 1300 gallon reservoir. So our beginning estimates of using 75% of the water compared to conventional farming were shattered! We not only used less water but <b>we actually gained water!</b> This Vertical System is challenging the way farming can be done. It is also a green friendly system where solar can be used to power the system. For every 10 degrees below 50 degrees we can successfully grow healthy sell able produce and we will be able to expand the areas in the USA and around the world that will allow outdoor farming without the need of greenhouses and indoor growing facilities! Our A3 Vertical Grow System is without a doubt a life altering growing machine to feed hungry mouths around the world who don't have access to healthy food! To go even further with our system, if we can produce in even 20 degree weather then we will literally open up most every state and country to grow outdoors all year round! This will most likely drive the cost of fresh produce down due to easier accessibility combined with a cost effective solution for small time and commercial farmers to grow and sell larger quantities of herbs, vegetables, and flowers!<br/><br/><h3>Why is this project important to the backers!<br/>
</h3>
<br/>Everyone eats food! Everyone pays for food! Most people do not eat enough fruits and vegetables, and poverty-stricken areas of the world do not eat enough because they simply cannot afford the price for quality produce. This system impacts everyone on this planet, all 7,000,000,000 of us! Being a backer in this project will literally bring the world that much closer to a better life!<br/><ul><li>For every $20.00 donated Leo Tek Inc. will donate 1 pound of produce to a local food bank.<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>Leo Tek Inc. understands that we may not be able to grow in the months of November to March. If we cannot grow all year round then we want to understand the temperature lows that this system allows for productive growth in our harvest. To do this we will have a temperature tracking system set up starting in September and this will document the temperature ranges and times that the plants were exposed to those ranges. <br/></p>
<p>We will have a heat trace installed in every row as to help keep the water at a temperature that we deem productive for the plants being grown. Also the reservior will have a water heater to keep the water source from freezing up and allow the water to be pumped through the intake tube into the channels to deliver the nutrients to the plants.</p>
<p>Leo Tek Inc. has a director of Agriculture that is also the inventor of the A3 Vertical Grow System. Justin Williams, the inventor has 15 years of experience with Hydroponics systems. He is also the founder of an indoor farming company named ""Grow Up Denver"". Justin Williams has spent many years developing the system, and fully understand the Hydroponics industry .</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If people cant contribute money, and see this as a great opportunity that impacts everyone. Please feel free to pass this project along to friends and family, or even on your twitter, Facebook, and linked In. The more noise we make the better! The more we attempt to take the risk to change things for the better the more eyes will draw to the prize! Eventually the right pair of eyes will have the resources to contribute monetarily. If Leo Tek Inc. should not reach our goal, then we will still be able to contribute the capital to building at least 1 new row.</p>

Podcast:Podcast InterviewThe A3 Vertical Grow System by Leo Tek Inc.- We plan on Revolutionizing Agriculture!
We currently have one row up and running on a 100 acre farm land in Longmont, Colorado. However we have a few goals we want to achieve. If we can make it through each of these goals we will prove the following:


That the pump can effectively generate water flow to up to at least Three of our vertical rows so that the plants can receive sufficient nutrients and hydration.
That the Vertical Grow system is effective in fall and winter. We wish to prove we can grow vegetables under 50 degree weather without losing more than 10% crop. If we can achieve growing in 20 degree weather we can guarantee certain regions of the USA and other parts of the world can farm outdoors All Year Round!

That the heat trace works, and the A3 Vertical Grow System can effectively work in freezing temperatures.
That the A3 Vertical Grow System requires roughly 1/4 of the personnel to harvest and maintain the system on a larger scale compared to traditional farming methods.
That the frame can be made out of stainless steel for durability and longevity.




Alexander Woods-Leo, President and CEO
Founder of Leo Tek Inc., a Diversified Holdings Company revolutionizing the world of Agriculture and Technology. Mr. Leo is an innovater and advocate for life-changing technology.


Justin Williams, Director of Agriculture
Inventor of the Patent Pending ""A3 Vertical Grow System"" and manager of the Leo Tek Inc. farm. 


Jonathan Bloomfield, Director of Business DevelopmentResponsible for overall company growth and development. 



What We Need
 In order to build 5 more rows we will need the following:

Class 200 PVC
Specialized Pump
Fittings
Hose Clamps
Concrete
Stainless Steel
Back hoe
Welder Machine
Generator
Plant cups

  
The Impact Leo Tek Inc. is trying to change the agriculture game. We have successfully utilized the one row we have built and working to grow 311 heads of lettuce. Currently we are trying the system with Lemon Basil and Purple Basil. With each test we are realizing that we are able to grow roughly 10x more in the same space that ""conventional farming"" allows for. We also know we can harvest an additional 3-4 times per season than ""conventional farming"". Further more, we actually have 10% more water return in the summer months in our 1300 gallon reservoir. So our beginning estimates of using 75% of the water compared to conventional farming were shattered! We not only used less water but we actually gained water! This Vertical System is challenging the way farming can be done. It is also a green friendly system where solar can be used to power the system. For every 10 degrees below 50 degrees we can successfully grow healthy sell able produce and we will be able to expand the areas in the USA and around the world that will allow outdoor farming without the need of greenhouses and indoor growing facilities! Our A3 Vertical Grow System is without a doubt a life altering growing machine to feed hungry mouths around the world who don't have access to healthy food! To go even further with our system, if we can produce in even 20 degree weather then we will literally open up most every state and country to grow outdoors all year round! This will most likely drive the cost of fresh produce down due to easier accessibility combined with a cost effective solution for small time and commercial farmers to grow and sell larger quantities of herbs, vegetables, and flowers!Why is this project important to the backers!

Everyone eats food! Everyone pays for food! Most people do not eat enough fruits and vegetables, and poverty-stricken areas of the world do not eat enough because they simply cannot afford the price for quality produce. This system impacts everyone on this planet, all 7,000,000,000 of us! Being a backer in this project will literally bring the world that much closer to a better life!For every $20.00 donated Leo Tek Inc. will donate 1 pound of produce to a local food bank.


  Risks & Challenges 
Leo Tek Inc. understands that we may not be able to grow in the months of November to March. If we cannot grow all year round then we want to understand the temperature lows that this system allows for productive growth in our harvest. To do this we will have a temperature tracking system set up starting in September and this will document the temperature ranges and times that the plants were exposed to those ranges. 
We will have a heat trace installed in every row as to help keep the water at a temperature that we deem productive for the plants being grown. Also the reservior will have a water heater to keep the water source from freezing up and allow the water to be pumped through the intake tube into the channels to deliver the nutrients to the plants.
Leo Tek Inc. has a director of Agriculture that is also the inventor of the A3 Vertical Grow System. Justin Williams, the inventor has 15 years of experience with Hydroponics systems. He is also the founder of an indoor farming company named ""Grow Up Denver"". Justin Williams has spent many years developing the system, and fully understand the Hydroponics industry .
  Other Ways You Can Help
If people cant contribute money, and see this as a great opportunity that impacts everyone. Please feel free to pass this project along to friends and family, or even on your twitter, Facebook, and linked In. The more noise we make the better! The more we attempt to take the risk to change things for the better the more eyes will draw to the prize! Eventually the right pair of eyes will have the resources to contribute monetarily. If Leo Tek Inc. should not reach our goal, then we will still be able to contribute the capital to building at least 1 new row.

<div>   After having gone viral, I was so moved by everyone's kind words, generosity and amazing stories that i decided to triple my donation so that each charity could recieve a check of $1000.00 EACH.</div>
<div>  I'd love to match every like and share but I'm by no means rich, I'm just a middle class American who is trying to make some lasting positive change in this world and hopefully help to save someones life through awareness of these causes and the wonderful charities below that save lifes EVERY day.</div>
<div>  With great passion, I urge you to give what you can.  Every Dollar, Euro and small donation make a difference.  The initial goal is 10,000 dollars and I will be splitting this fund up between the Siteman Cancer Center, Preferred Family Healthcare and ALS (St. Louis, Mo. Chapter).  Links to each site are below.  I can't thank all of you enough for touching my life and helping to provide awareness and healing where hurt used to exist.  Please join me in trying to save someone's life who is in need.  My heart reaches out to you with warmth and blessings.</div>

<h1> <b>What Is It? </b>
</h1>
<p>     The Cyclone is a block based (LEGO® , Kre-o, Mega Bloks, etc.) roller coaster construction toy. It will be the first commercially available kit that combines the versatility of the world's leading building block system with the realism and excitement of the CoasterDynamix track system. The result is an amazing roller coaster model that is easy to build and fun to customize. Join multiple sets together to make larger, more elaborate custom designs.The possibilities are endless! </p>
<h1>What Do You Get?</h1>
<p>     The Cyclone kit comes with over 1000 individual pieces and has everything needed to build a 4' long working roller coaster model. This includes standard and custom bricks, lift chain, gears, hand crank, track, and a train. With the provided instructions, the kit is easy and fun to build with no need for extra pieces or complicated tools.</p>

I have always considered myself to be environmentally friendly and conscious of how I and others impact the earth.

      Having not known what I wanted to do once I graduated this past December (only that I wanted to in some way work to help the environment and other people), everything I was doing and learning about finally came together and pointed me toward taking this leap of faith and journeying to Burlington to embark on what I hope will be a fulfilling and rewarding experience.
      I envision a food system that, little by little, will turn more local and sustainable, nurturing communities to strengthen their relationships with where and how their food was grown, and also how to prepare it.

In some ways, I see this farming program helping me with a personal discovery of my own, but more importantly I know it will also allow me to share with others what I learn by eventually using my skills to provide local communities with fresh, healthful, responsibly grown food. It is my hope that the farmer training will lead me on a career path in  small-scale organic agriculture. I am particularly interested in urban agriculture and vertical farming, and I would love to use the skills I acquire at the program to find a job in either of those fields!

<p>Defancy was born from the notion that we all
deserve to get home safely and feel secure anywhere, at all times. Pepper
spray, ever growing in popularity, has already become a must-have for any teen
and adult who care about their own well being.</p>
<p>Defancy, the latest state-of-the-art development in
the field, redefines your real-time ability to protect those you care about the
most.</p>
<p>Defancy’s spraying mechanism is unique to our products
and engineered to spray a small amount of very strong substance for seconds.
With the right usage, you can defend yourselves from up to three attackers with
only one container. </p>
<p>Defancy offers significant advantages over
other products in its category:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Accessibility</b>. It’s convenient to carry and easy to
     use, making sure you are protected from any human or animal attacker 24/7.</li>
<li>
<b>Aesthetics</b>. It’s a beautiful product which lets you look good and keep
     safe at the same time.</li>
<li>
<b>Efficiency</b>. Despite its small size, Defancy allows for 5-7 clicks
     before running out.</li>
<li>
<b>Ease of use</b>. All of our products use a push-push mechanism for separating the
     spray container from its base. That means you’re always just one click
     away from protection.</li>

<br/>
<p><b>Pepper spray, always works, on everyone.</b></p>
<p>The main advantage of pepper spray is its
effectiveness it is in comparison to other similar products, such as tear gas,
whose ability is reduced and even non-existent in some cases – for instance
against drug addicts, people under the influence of alcohol or sedatives and some
animals. </p>
<p>Pepper spray is
extremely easy to use and intuitive. It’s made from oleoresin capsicum (which
is why you might know it as OC spray), a lachrymatory agent.</p>
<p><b>About the pepper spray we use</b></p>
<p>Defancy is your personal defense against human
or animal attacks.</p>
<p>Defancy is a one-of-a-kind formula created by
the best minds in the field. Our pepper spray contains over 3 million SHU (Scoville
Heat Units), providing an extremely high burn intensity.</p>
<p>Every Defancy product has the highest
concentration of pepper spray permitted by law in your country. We manufacture
a variety of items with different levels of active ingredient concentration in
order to comply with most countries’ standards. </p>
<p>Defancy contains Gel for stickiness - the
pepper spray sticks to the attacker’s face so that pepper must be washed off. </p>
<p>Using Gel helps make your shot more accurate
and significantly lowers the effect of wind on the material’s dispersion.</p>
<p>The additive gel’s weight helps to increase the
spray’s mass, which means we can minimize the material’s effect on objects that
did not come in direct contact with it. (In regular pepper spray devices, at
least 20% of the material sprayed can cause discomfort to other people who were
in the area. </p>
<p>All Defancy sprays contain a special
ultraviolet coloring substance, invisible to the naked eye and non-washable. The
color stays on the skin for up to three days to help the authorities identify
your attacker.</p>
<p>The size of the container was also carefully
chosen. It only takes one second of spraying to neutralize a human or an animal
for at least 40 minutes. Additionally, Defancy’s small size, less than 15
grams, is what lets us give you higher doses of the active ingredient, which
larger containers are simply not allowed to store.</p>
<p>And finally, as the product is oil-based, it is
highly durable to extreme weather and physical stress. Its proper function is
guaranteed to work in temperatures of -4+158 Fahrenheit (-<span>20+70 degrees Celsius). </span></p>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Another highly convenient item is the wristwatch add-on, a small pepper spray container that comes with industry strength double-sided adhesive and is small and thin enough to fit on your watch - so you can feel safe wherever you go. The design is comfortable and will never bother your wrist. You can just as easily stick it on your iPhone, for full protection right in your pocket.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The wristwatch add-on comes in two different sizes:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">1. Medium Diameter circle 1.02 Inches (26 Millimeter) </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">2.Large-Diameter circle 1.26 Inches (32 Millimeter)</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">It can fit almost all different types of watches.(Except for the small ones) When you buy this product you get three different holders,(in addition to the three spray containers ).</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">In case you want to switch between watches and still remain protected, you can also choose to stick one of the holders on your phone.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote style=""font-weight: normal;""><span>Note: The wristwatch add-on only fits flat watch-bases. Use a simple home ruler to make sure your watch’s base  (the part that touches your wrist ) isn’t curved. If it is, the add-on may not be able to stick to it optimally.</span></blockquote>

What is Defancy?
Defancy was born from the notion that we all
deserve to get home safely and feel secure anywhere, at all times. Pepper
spray, ever growing in popularity, has already become a must-have for any teen

Aesthetics. It’s a beautiful product which lets you look good and keep
     safe at the same time.

Efficiency. Despite its small size, Defancy allows for 5-7 clicks
     before running out.

Ease of use. All of our products use a push-push mechanism for separating the
     spray container from its base. That means you’re always just one click
     away from protection.




Defancy was designed with careful consideration
as to the most efficient and convenient way to use it with one hand, so your
other hand remains free.

Pepper spray, always works, on everyone.
The main advantage of pepper spray is its
effectiveness it is in comparison to other similar products, such as tear gas,
whose ability is reduced and even non-existent in some cases – for instance
against drug addicts, people under the influence of alcohol or sedatives and some
animals. 
Pepper spray is
extremely easy to use and intuitive. It’s made from oleoresin capsicum (which
is why you might know it as OC spray), a lachrymatory agent.
About the pepper spray we use
Defancy is your personal defense against human
or animal attacks.
Defancy is a one-of-a-kind formula created by
the best minds in the field. Our pepper spray contains over 3 million SHU (Scoville
Heat Units), providing an extremely high burn intensity.
Every Defancy product has the highest
concentration of pepper spray permitted by law in your country. We manufacture
a variety of items with different levels of active ingredient concentration in
order to comply with most countries’ standards. 
Defancy contains Gel for stickiness - the
pepper spray sticks to the attacker’s face so that pepper must be washed off. 
Using Gel helps make your shot more accurate
and significantly lowers the effect of wind on the material’s dispersion.
The additive gel’s weight helps to increase the
spray’s mass, which means we can minimize the material’s effect on objects that
did not come in direct contact with it. (In regular pepper spray devices, at
least 20% of the material sprayed can cause discomfort to other people who were
in the area. 
All Defancy sprays contain a special
ultraviolet coloring substance, invisible to the naked eye and non-washable. The
color stays on the skin for up to three days to help the authorities identify
your attacker.
The size of the container was also carefully
chosen. It only takes one second of spraying to neutralize a human or an animal
for at least 40 minutes. Additionally, Defancy’s small size, less than 15
grams, is what lets us give you higher doses of the active ingredient, which
larger containers are simply not allowed to store.
And finally, as the product is oil-based, it is
highly durable to extreme weather and physical stress. Its proper function is
guaranteed to work in temperatures of -4+158 Fahrenheit (-20+70 degrees Celsius).

Hi, my name is Nir Neria and I’m the founder responsible for this wonderful new product.
Once, out of care for my family, I bought myself and my loved ones pepper spray cans. Buying them made me feel and think that we’re protected. Soon enough I realized that it just wasn’t enough. There were too many occasions on which we needed the cans and for various reasons did not have them by our side.
I was suddenly reminded of an incident I’d had not long ago, when I scratched my eyes shortly after cutting hot peppers. The painful results of that scratch came back to my mind. That day I promised myself to check exactly what it takes to neutralize an attacker. In addition to consulting with specialists, I decided to try it out myself. I sprayed a minuscule amount on my own face. That’s when I realized the world needs the new product which you are about to see..
We all tell our loved ones at least once a day to take care of themselves. Today, thanks to Defancy, it’s time to go beyond just saying, and give them the right tools for the task. With Defancy they can be protected 24/7. Don’t tell them to take care - give them the tools to be able to do so.",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

sparkly new décor. We want to schedule more easy games that anyone can join and offer opportunity for free exploration. The Artphones will connect tables, stage and some other points at Nowhere, for more interactive fun: There
will be automated assignments, but also the possibility for anyone (or secret
inciting agents from afar) to call up the tables or the stage, giving or
asking for instructions or artistic input or some crazy acts of daring. We will

returns with the lovely Cabaret sign and stage background, as well as most of the technical equipment and lights from last year, but
this time (due to the experience with wind last year) a more sheltered stage. A
new, somewhat bigger shaded space will harbour our colourful little tables and chairs, with some
sparkly new décor. We want to schedule more easy games that anyone can join and offer opportunity for free exploration. The Artphones will connect tables, stage and some other points at Nowhere, for more interactive fun: There
will be automated assignments, but also the possibility for anyone (or secret
inciting agents from afar) to call up the tables or the stage, giving or
asking for instructions or artistic input or some crazy acts of daring. We will
have some announced plays and themed evenings.TeamThe DSC
Team is an international bunch of Burners from Southern France, Vienna (Austrian Burners Association) and other
European cities. Project leads are:
* Sebastian
aka “Lightning” (previous art projects at Nowhere: 2008 ORNI, 2009 rolling
gardenswing, 2010-11 ARTPHONE, 2012 installation of a nest, 2013 SweetART - the
candyflosswigmakingcart, Drunken Sobriety Cabaret 2014), 
*Tünde aka
“Thunder” (2013 The Altar of Spontaneous Baptism and Gifting, Vienna Burning Ball 2014 and 2015, Drunken Sobriety Cabaret 2014).
Other team
members are Krevette, Monica, Judy, Andrea, Olivier, Corinne...",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Karan Sah and I
am a Life Scout at Troop 425 based in Lexington SC Zion Lutheran Church. I am
planning on completing my Eagle Rank in the following months. For my Eagle
Scout Project, I have chosen to build a staircase and the beginning of a walkway
for the pavilion near the wetlands. I have been to Saluda Shoals Park many
times and I have camped there with my troop multiple times. I first came here
as a child and I continue to use its resources for camping, access to the
river, and other recreational activities. It would be an honor if I could give
back to the park by building this staircase and the beginning of a walkway. I
have experience with building and construction with wood and other outdoor
material such as building numerous benches and trails. My
troop also has a high variety of skills and experience which can come into use
during the construction of my project. Most of the volunteers that will help me
with the construction of the project will come from this pool. To lead the
volunteers I plan to use the past experience I received from being a leader in
the troop and other groups I was part of. </p>
<p>Project</p>
<p>The project contains a new
staircase for the pavilion by the wetlands and a start of a walkway. The first
part of the project would be the clearing of the area where the staircase will
go. This included clearing small trees and shrubs that block the path and
possibly leveling the ground a little to ensure a good build. Part of the
pavilion will also have to go (right side) to make room for the staircase. We
will be careful with this process taking out the planks. My design has the staircase
using the already existing posts for the first posts for the staircase
stringers to go through. We will then place five other posts for the stringers.
There will be three stringers, so in the middle there will be three posts and
at the end there will be two posts. The walkway will be in a design where the
water will be available to endure water flooding. The wood that I will use for
the project will be treated pinewood and the screws will be galvanized
non-corrosive steel to ensure a long lifetime for both the staircase and
walkway. The design will be similar to already existing staircases at the park
to so there will be matching and professional- looking. The walkway will be in
the simple shape of square and it will connect with the staircase.</p><br/></div>","Introduction

Help us grow local independent roasters!



“Our business focus is to empower local
roasters and cafes but also to help consumers save money and find new stores”
We aim to unite
independent coffee roasters and coffee togetherand give them economic scale
and tools that they
cannot get by themselves,but keeping
their independent atmosphereIt’s hard to
support local coffee shops, especially when the big chains seems to occupy
every block in Seoul.Therefore, we
are designed to give small coffee shops a competitive advantage in an
increasingly competitive marketplace.
What We Do




We work exclusively with Seoul’s top rated, small-batch independent roasters.


Unlike factory roasting, our partners source beans
and roast with the
greatest of care


We curate every coffee
we offer, bringing the best of the neighborhood café into customers home.


We offer flexible
subscription plans with  no hassles or commitments.







How It Works




We hand-pick gourmet
coffees from Seoul’s top roasters every month


Coffee bean ships to customer within 48
hours of roasting
to ensure peak freshness


We brew and enjoy discovering new favorites from world-renowned coffee
roasters


We make it
easy. Free to
cancel any time. Skip months or change preference.

<p>We want GravityLight to be an empowering

<p>As well as designing GravityLight
to provide a clean, safe and affordable alternative to kerosene lamps, we also
want to
create local jobs, skills and livelihoods for
those who make and sell GravityLights.</p>
<p>Although GravityLight will be available
internationally, Kenya is a one of our launch markets for off-grid families. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It represents
a gateway to East Africa and has an emerging manufacturing industry, which we
hope to help develop and grow.</span></p>

<p>In
supporting this campaign, you’ll be an invaluable part of GravityLight’s
journey. It’s not often that people are part of such formative stages in a
product’s development and we’re excited to share one of the first, ‘beta’
versions of GL02 with you.</p>
<p>GravityLight
is unique. It creates a new category of lighting: it’s not just a variation on
something that already exists. This raises different challenges to an
‘off-the-shelf’ or ‘me2’ product</p>
<p><b>Product development journey:</b></p>
<p>We
have spent over a year transforming a very successful design (GL01) into a
game-changing product (GL02). Over the next few months we will be commissioning
tooling to create the first-off samples of GL02 to test and further optimize.
There may be further improvements that we identify in this process – which
means that you’ll be getting an even better design, that may even look slightly
different from the images shown.</p>
<p><b>Quality Control:</b></p>
<p>When
we have the first few samples produced we will need to ensure these meet our
quality standards. If <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">they
don't this is where iterative tweaks and improvements to the data and moulds
are needed.</span></p>
<p>We
have factored in several months for this process, which may involve iterative
edits and improvements until we’re happy with what we’re sending you. However,
if these take longer than anticipated, we’ll let you know why along with a
revised timeline.</p>
<p><b>Beta GravityLights:</b></p>
<p>You’ll
be receiving one of the first samples of the new GravityLight design: GL02. We
will have rigorous Quality Control and Quality Assurance processes in place but
there still could be a few ‘bugs’ that aren’t picked up in this testing. This
is an important part of the learning process and we’d really appreciate your
feedback on these. </p>
<p>For
example, with GL01, we found a defect occurring during transit over sea, and
we heard that UV light was causing some of the straps to become brittle and
snap. This became valuable to integrate into our design considerations and testing for GL02.</p>
<p>We
have done extensive ‘accelerated life testing’ of the GL02 prototype and so
have worked to eliminate all the issues we identified, however you may find
something new. We’ll set up a forum to hear how <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">you
use your GravityLight and your suggestions for further developments.
Thank you for being part of this journey!</span></p>
<p><b>Setting up assembly facilities in Kenya:</b></p>
<p>We've previously set up assembly lines in China and have found a brilliant,
experienced partner to set up assembly in Kenya. </p>
<p>For
‘Made in Africa’ perks, GravityLights will
be assembled in Kenya on the new assembly line established there. We’ve
factored in an additional 4 months during which components will be shipped to
Kenya, the new assembly line trained and assembly kicked off, with a growing
pace. </p>
<p>That
said, if anything unexpected happens that delays this timeline, we’ll let you know
why along with a revised delivery
date.</p>
<p><b>Shipping your rewards:</b></p>
<p>From
experience, this took several months for some GravityLights to
arrive. We’ve
assumed 2 months in the perk descriptions – we’ll let you know the date they
ship.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Together
the
GravityLight team have over 60 years combined experience in product
design, collaborating with different partners and bringing products to market.</p>
<p>From
inventing a gravity-powered light to establishing assembly of these in Kenya,
we aren’t ones to take well-trodden paths! Instead, we aim to maximise the
positive benefits that GravityLight can bring – for those who use, create and
sell them.</p>
<p>This
is our second
Indiegogo
campaign for GravityLight, which means we know a lot about the challenges
ahead! You’re
in experienced hands.</p>

<div>
<p><b>Are you a non-profit organisation?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
The GravityLight Foundation is a registered UK charity. </p>
<p>So
if you’re
a UK taxpayer, please let us know so that we can maximise your generosity and
claim Gift Aid from the UK government!</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>How does GravityLight work?</b></p>
<p>Once
GravityLight is installed and a 12kg weight – a bag of rocks or sand – attached, it’s ready to go, anytime.</p>
<p>The
weight is lifted by pulling down on a bead cord. On release, the weight falls
very slowly, transforming potential energy into kinetic energy as it powers a
drive sprocket and polymer gear train.</p>
<p>This
generates just under a tenth of a watt, to power an onboard LED and ancillary devices. </p>
<p>Once
the
weighted bag reaches the floor, which depends on how high it was installed, it
is simply lifted to repeat the process.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Can it power other things?</b></p>
<p>Along
with your GravityLight, you’ll also receive 2 SatLights which can be daisy- chained around the
room and used as task lights. </p>
<p>GravityLight
has a DC jack where SatLights and
other devices, such as a radio, can be attached. We’d love to hear what you
use your GravityLight to power with a tenth of a watt.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>How long does the GravityLight work for
per lift?</b></p>

With
GL02, it depends on how high you install your GravityLight. The winch system in
GL02 means that anyone can use GravityLight, however high it is installed. A 6ft drop gives over 20 minutes of light.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>In your last campaign I could
‘buy one, give one’. Can I do that again?</b></p>
<p>We chose this approach previously as we
were testing the concept of GravityLight – would people use one?
Would it
work in different conditions and how long would it last for. There were so many
unknowns to find
out that
we felt gifting these to our trialists in off-grid communities was the right
approach.</p>
<p>We have worked hard to find the right
balance between low cost, good quality and elegant design. Going
forward, our
approach is
one of selling GravityLights for
several reasons:
</p>
<p><b>- Creating livelihoods:</b> Working
through local distribution partners and sales agents means that people <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">can earn a living through selling GravityLights and
similar products.
Rather
than </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">undermining the local economy by giving
away free products, we
are
able to create jobs and help </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">people earn an income through GravityLight.</span></p>
<p><b>- Building a scalable, sustainable
approach:</b> If
we gave away GravityLights to
over 1.3
billion people
that <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">don’t have access to electricity, we
would need to raise a lot of money! Instead, by creating a product that </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">people value and are willing to pay for,
GravityLight will be able to reach far more people, more quickly, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">without it’s fate being reliant on
continuous fundraising. We are building a social venture that will be self-sustaining </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">in 3 years time.</span></p>
<p>That said, you are welcome to pledge for a GravityLight
– or many - and ask us to send these to someone else. Just let
us know
when we ask for delivery addresses where you’d like them sent.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why Kenya?</b></p>
<p>Kenya, is one of our key ‘launch markets’
in the next 12 months. Having researched and visited several <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">countries and potential partners, we
chose it for many reasons including:</span></p>
<p><b>- International Trading Infrastructure:</b></p>
<p>Mombasa port, on the coast of Kenya, is a key
international shipping hub. This means that it has the <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">infrastructure to cope with international
shipments from suppliers of GravityLight components.</span></p>
<p><b>- Access to sub-Saharan Africa</b></p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 800 million
off-grid people and, as the grid struggles to keep pace with <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">population growth, this number continues
to rise. It is therefore an important geographical area for our
work to </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">eliminate kerosene lamps and serve
off-grid communities.</span></p>
<p>Kenya, as part of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa,
is a

</div></div>","For your incredible support! We're thrilled to have hit our target and be able to put our plans in motion to set up an assembly line in Kenya - where many of you will be receiving your GravityLights from in 2016!
Our campaign is still open, 'in demand', to enable those that missed our campaign deadline to still support and be a part of GravityLight: Made in Africa.  
We will be keeping you posted with updates via Indiegogo on what we're up to and our progress on setting up in Kenya.
You can also follow us on twitter and Facebook too.
Thank you again!

GravityLight is an innovative
solution that
generates power from the lift of a weight.



As Featured In:








Instant light, any time


No sun or batteries needed


With GravityLight all you need is a
weight.





Feedback from global trials of our first design, GL01, was extremely encouraging!
Vitally, it also gave us insights into what needed improving.
After extensive iterations and accelerated life testing we developed an improved model, GL02, that is:





Today, over
1 in 5 people do not have electricity. Instead, they rely on dangerous and
polluting kerosene lamps for light.
GravityLight
has been designed primarily as a safe, clean and affordable alternative to kerosene lamps.
Your
support will enable us to launch our improved GravityLight - to help eliminate kerosene lamps - as well as to establish an
assembly line in Kenya.




Hear from Evelyn what it's like to use a kerosene lamp for light:








In
2014, enabled by the Indiegogo
community,  we conducted global trials
with over 1300 off-grid families of our first GravityLight design – GL01. 
Over 90% of those who tried GravityLight
said they would use one instead of a kerosene lamp!


Switching from kerosene to GravityLight starts a positive cycle of benefits - of money saved, increased productive
hours and improved health. 

In parallel, GravityLight
eliminates the carbon dioxide and black carbon that kerosene lamps emit. 




















We want GravityLight to be an empowering
product in every sense of the word.
As well as designing GravityLight
to provide a clean, safe and affordable alternative to kerosene lamps, we also
want to
create local jobs, skills and livelihoods for
those who make and sell GravityLights.
Although GravityLight will be available
internationally, Kenya is a one of our launch markets for off-grid families. It represents
a gateway to East Africa and has an emerging manufacturing industry, which we
hope to help develop and grow.
Our approach is to learn
from and partner with the best and we’ve found a fantastic, like-minded
partner to work with in Kenya: Burn Cookstove
Manufacturers.



Our goal is to raise $199,000 in 40 days!
With these funds we can set up assembly in Kenya of our new and improved GravityLight: GL02. 
Your support will fund materials, such as soldering irons, assembly jigs and quality testing equipment, as well as staff training on assembling GravityLight and performing QC and QA checks.
If you choose the ‘Made in Africa’ perks, your GravityLights will be some of the first off this new line!  If you choose 'ASAP', you will still be supporting setting up operations in Kenya but, to get your GravityLight more quickly, means it will be assembled in China.
Once you’ve chosen your reward, you can also opt to add an additional donation – which will directly support building local jobs and skills in Kenya by establishing our assembly line there. 
NB. The GravityLight Foundation is a UK registered charity, so please let us know if you are a UK tax payer to enable us to claim Gift Aid from the UK government. 
Many thanks for your support – this couldn’t happen without it!














In
supporting this campaign, you’ll be an invaluable part of GravityLight’s
journey. It’s not often that people are part of such formative stages in a
product’s development and we’re excited to share one of the first, ‘beta’
versions of GL02 with you.
GravityLight
is unique. It creates a new category of lighting: it’s not just a variation on
something that already exists. This raises different challenges to an
‘off-the-shelf’ or ‘me2’ product
Product development journey:
We
have spent over a year transforming a very successful design (GL01) into a
game-changing product (GL02). Over the next few months we will be commissioning
tooling to create the first-off samples of GL02 to test and further optimize.
There may be further improvements that we identify in this process – which
means that you’ll be getting an even better design, that may even look slightly
different from the images shown.
Quality Control:
When
we have the first few samples produced we will need to ensure these meet our
quality standards. If they
don't this is where iterative tweaks and improvements to the data and moulds
are needed.
We
have factored in several months for this process, which may involve iterative
edits and improvements until we’re happy with what we’re sending you. However,
if these take longer than anticipated, we’ll let you know why along with a
revised timeline.
Beta GravityLights:
You’ll
be receiving one of the first samples of the new GravityLight design: GL02. We
will have rigorous Quality Control and Quality Assurance processes in place but
there still could be a few ‘bugs’ that aren’t picked up in this testing. This
is an important part of the learning process and we’d really appreciate your
feedback on these. 
For
example, with GL01, we found a defect occurring during transit over sea, and
we heard that UV light was causing some of the straps to become brittle and
snap. This became valuable to integrate into our design considerations and testing for GL02.
We
have done extensive ‘accelerated life testing’ of the GL02 prototype and so
have worked to eliminate all the issues we identified, however you may find
something new. We’ll set up a forum to hear how you
use your GravityLight and your suggestions for further developments.
Thank you for being part of this journey!
Setting up assembly facilities in Kenya:
We've previously set up assembly lines in China and have found a brilliant,
experienced partner to set up assembly in Kenya. 
For
‘Made in Africa’ perks, GravityLights will
be assembled in Kenya on the new assembly line established there. We’ve
factored in an additional 4 months during which components will be shipped to
Kenya, the new assembly line trained and assembly kicked off, with a growing
pace. 
That
said, if anything unexpected happens that delays this timeline, we’ll let you know
why along with a revised delivery
date.
Shipping your rewards:
From
experience, this took several months for some GravityLights to
arrive. We’ve
assumed 2 months in the perk descriptions – we’ll let you know the date they
ship.



Together
the
GravityLight team have over 60 years combined experience in product
design, collaborating with different partners and bringing products to market.
From
inventing a gravity-powered light to establishing assembly of these in Kenya,
we aren’t ones to take well-trodden paths! Instead, we aim to maximise the
positive benefits that GravityLight can bring – for those who use, create and
sell them.
This
is our second
Indiegogo
campaign for GravityLight, which means we know a lot about the challenges
ahead! You’re
in experienced hands.






Are you a non-profit organisation?
Yes.
The GravityLight Foundation is a registered UK charity. 
So
if you’re
a UK taxpayer, please let us know so that we can maximise your generosity and
claim Gift Aid from the UK government!

How does GravityLight work?
Once
GravityLight is installed and a 12kg weight – a bag of rocks or sand – attached, it’s ready to go, anytime.
The
weight is lifted by pulling down on a bead cord. On release, the weight falls
very slowly, transforming potential energy into kinetic energy as it powers a
drive sprocket and polymer gear train.
This
generates just under a tenth of a watt, to power an onboard LED and ancillary devices. 
Once
the
weighted bag reaches the floor, which depends on how high it was installed, it
is simply lifted to repeat the process.

Can it power other things?
Along
with your GravityLight, you’ll also receive 2 SatLights which can be daisy- chained around the
room and used as task lights. 
GravityLight
has a DC jack where SatLights and
other devices, such as a radio, can be attached. We’d love to hear what you
use your GravityLight to power with a tenth of a watt.

How long does the GravityLight work for
per lift?

With
GL02, it depends on how high you install your GravityLight. The winch system in
GL02 means that anyone can use GravityLight, however high it is installed. A 6ft drop gives over 20 minutes of light.




In your last campaign I could
‘buy one, give one’. Can I do that again?
We chose this approach previously as we
were testing the concept of GravityLight – would people use one?
Would it
work in different conditions and how long would it last for. There were so many
unknowns to find
out that
we felt gifting these to our trialists in off-grid communities was the right
approach.
We have worked hard to find the right
balance between low cost, good quality and elegant design. Going
forward, our
approach is
one of selling GravityLights for
several reasons:

- Creating livelihoods: Working
through local distribution partners and sales agents means that people can earn a living through selling GravityLights and
similar products.
Rather
than undermining the local economy by giving
away free products, we
are
able to create jobs and help people earn an income through GravityLight.
- Building a scalable, sustainable
approach: If
we gave away GravityLights to
over 1.3
billion people
that don’t have access to electricity, we
would need to raise a lot of money! Instead, by creating a product that people value and are willing to pay for,
GravityLight will be able to reach far more people, more quickly, without it’s fate being reliant on
continuous fundraising. We are building a social venture that will be self-sustaining in 3 years time.
That said, you are welcome to pledge for a GravityLight
– or many - and ask us to send these to someone else. Just let
us know
when we ask for delivery addresses where you’d like them sent.

Why Kenya?
Kenya, is one of our key ‘launch markets’
in the next 12 months. Having researched and visited several countries and potential partners, we
chose it for many reasons including:
- International Trading Infrastructure:
Mombasa port, on the coast of Kenya, is a key
international shipping hub. This means that it has the infrastructure to cope with international
shipments from suppliers of GravityLight components.
- Access to sub-Saharan Africa
Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 800 million
off-grid people and, as the grid struggles to keep pace with population growth, this number continues
to rise. It is therefore an important geographical area for our
work to eliminate kerosene lamps and serve
off-grid communities.
Kenya, as part of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa,
is a
traditional gateway into East Africa and parts of Southern Africa. This
means that, once we’ve established partnerships, approaches and routes to market that work well in Kenya,
we can look to understand how these need to be tailored to expand into neighbouring
countries.
- Great partners
We’ve met a range of experienced and
inspiring partners, including Burn, who are based in Kenya. Many of them have operations across East Africa
but Kenya is where they have their largest operations.
Achieving economies of scale is critical
in helping us keep the price of GravityLight low, so we are keen to develop a successful approach in Kenya that will
help keep costs
down for neighbouring
countries too.

<p>Hi everyone I'm chosing to keep  my name annonymous, if that's okay.</p>
<p>I'm a married teenager with a cat.. we're living in my husbands car and it's honestly been a struggle for us.. we move from walmart parking lot to the next.</p>
<p>ã€€</p>
<p>Our cat has her own space in the backseat with her litterbox and food/water set up.</p>
<p> <strong>ATTENTION:</strong></p>
<p>we take very good care of our cat.. on ""good days""</p>
<p>we put her harnest on and let her run around a local park.</p>
<p>(we feel she needs to get out as much as possible and stretch her legs)</p>
<p>My husband has a landscaping job... he doesn't make much at all though. We live off his paycheck but have nothing left over.</p>
<p>His paycheck pays for all of the listed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cat food and cat litter</li>
<li>Food for us to eat</li>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>We buy one day gym passes just to use the showers</li>
<li>Laundry Mat to wash our clothes</li>
</ul><p>The list goes on...</p>
<p> and we never have enough to put aside to try to get a place of our own..</p>
<p>While my husband is at work, I take care of our cat, sometimes if we're parked next to stores I'll walk around and window shop. I'll get fresh air or take a run.. the other day I was surfing the net and found a video of kids teasing a bus driver.. it broke my heart.. I was crying with her. Me and my husband have such little money but I donated $5.00 anyways.. I felt God means it when he says.. if you give.. you'll recieve more.. so I'm hoping that'll happen.</p>
<p>I wasn't going to make a page because I don't like begging and I'm honestly embarassed and ashamed of our situation but I thought I'd leave it in God's hands and see if this works out..</p>
<p>I'm trying to raise money so me and my husband can get an apartment of our own.. I'm hoping we can have enough raised to put a down payment and pay off a couple months.. I'm not sure as to where we want to find a place but the searching will begin if we get the money raised..</p>
<p>I'd also like to buy a bed, some furniture... just things we need... we are not in the position to buy stuff we ""want"" .. not yet that is.</p>
<p>Please find it in your heart to help us out.</p>
<p>ã€€</p>
<p>the trunk is our closet.. it's where we keep all our clothes..</p>
<p>the backseat is where we keep our other things and it's also where my cats stuff is and where she sleeps. It's very important me and my husband get out and stretch because us sleeping seperate in our car seats are killing our backs. :(</p>
<p><strong><em>Our Story:</em></strong></p>
<p>we both come from very small families...</p>
<p>both of them were against our marriage.. my family stopped speaking to me because I married him and his family told him they'd never accept me..</p>
<p>so we chose to move away..</p>
<p>we both had a lot of money saved because we had good jobs.. but we quit to move to San Antonio, Texas... where we found a room to rent out.. with a woman who posted she had a room available on craigslist. We lived with her for 5 months.</p>
<p>but she told us we had 10 days to leave because she was having her sister move in.. she felt very badly but we didn't want to be a bother so we packed up and left.</p>
<p>we have no one but each other and everyday we are praying for a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>MY HUSBAND DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS</strong></p>
<p>He's at work right now and I'm supposed to pick him up in in 2 hours. it's 7PM right now on 6/21/12</p>
<p>I want to do this not only for us but mainly for him.</p>
<p>He has done nothing but love me.. he tries so hard to bring home money and he tries so hard to take care of me.. I know he's struggling and I know he's depressed.. I wish I could be the one with the job..</p>
<p>the one taking care of him but he'd never let that happen..</p>
<p>unless it was through a website like this and he didn't know!</p>
<p>His birthday is in July. He will be 19 years old and I know I could turn both our lives around if I do this and earn money for us...</p>
<p><strong>My plan:</strong></p>
<p>Is to earn money so that on his birthday, I can surprise him by dressing up really pretty.. taking him out for fancy sushi and telling him everything I did.. then showing him the amount in our bank account.. and telling him that we are looking for an apartment as soon as possible.. then getting to go to the store and getting a little furniture..</p>
<p>his heart would smile if it could... I can see it now. That is my dream to make my husband proud. He deserves this... working till early morning to late night.. not coming home to a home cooked mean but instead leftovers from a cheap fastfood place.. then having to sleep in a car seat that can't even go all the way back.. it breaks my heart.. it makes me feel like he should have never married me, instead listened to his family so he could at least sleep in a warm bed.</p>
<p>I know if I can make this happen for both of us...</p>
<p> he'll be proud of me.. that's all I long for.</p>
<p>ã€€</p>
<p><strong>What we go through:</strong></p>
<p>We have to buy CHEAP food at fast food places, everyday.</p>
<p>We buy daily gym passes to take showers. $10 each.. and my husband gets one everyday because he works in hard labor and needs one /:</p>
<p>If we don't have money for it, we go to a car wash and use the sink to wash up in.</p>
<p>We use A LOT of gas because we're constantly looking for a new job for him..</p>
<p>We park outside hotels and starbucks to get internet ..like i'm doing now.</p>
<p>we have had to pawn everything valuable to us.. his xbox 360, our good laptop, we kept the crappy one.. lots of games and dvds.. we're down to the bone when it comes to having our nice stuff being sold.. we even had to pawn his wedding ring but we got it back when we pawned other stuff and used half his paycheck..</p>
<p><em>I don't want people feeling sorry for us.</em></p>
<p>I know we're EVEN LUCKY TO HAVE A CAR to sleep in. I know we're lucky to have money for FOOD. God blessed us with that.. but like I said,</p>
<p>I want to surprise my husband and make him proud.</p>
<p> I know his heart would fill with joy if I got to do this for him.</p>

I'll get fresh air or take a run.. the other day I was surfing the net and found a video of kids teasing a bus driver.. it broke my heart.. I was crying with her. Me and my husband have such little money but I donated $5.00 anyways.. I felt God means it when he says.. if you give.. you'll recieve more.. so I'm hoping that'll happen.
I wasn't going to make a page because I don't like begging and I'm honestly embarassed and ashamed of our situation but I thought I'd leave it in God's hands and see if this works out..
I'm trying to raise money so me and my husband can get an apartment of our own.. I'm hoping we can have enough raised to put a down payment and pay off a couple months.. I'm not sure as to where we want to find a place but the searching will begin if we get the money raised..
I'd also like to buy a bed, some furniture... just things we need... we are not in the position to buy stuff we ""want"" .. not yet that is.
Please find it in your heart to help us out.
ã€€
the trunk is our closet.. it's where we keep all our clothes..
the backseat is where we keep our other things and it's also where my cats stuff is and where she sleeps. It's very important me and my husband get out and stretch because us sleeping seperate in our car seats are killing our backs. :(
Our Story:
we both come from very small families...
both of them were against our marriage.. my family stopped speaking to me because I married him and his family told him they'd never accept me..
so we chose to move away..
we both had a lot of money saved because we had good jobs.. but we quit to move to San Antonio, Texas... where we found a room to rent out.. with a woman who posted she had a room available on craigslist. We lived with her for 5 months.
but she told us we had 10 days to leave because she was having her sister move in.. she felt very badly but we didn't want to be a bother so we packed up and left.
we have no one but each other and everyday we are praying for a miracle.
MY HUSBAND DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS
He's at work right now and I'm supposed to pick him up in in 2 hours. it's 7PM right now on 6/21/12
I want to do this not only for us but mainly for him.
He has done nothing but love me.. he tries so hard to bring home money and he tries so hard to take care of me.. I know he's struggling and I know he's depressed.. I wish I could be the one with the job..
the one taking care of him but he'd never let that happen..
unless it was through a website like this and he didn't know!
His birthday is in July. He will be 19 years old and I know I could turn both our lives around if I do this and earn money for us...
My plan:
Is to earn money so that on his birthday, I can surprise him by dressing up really pretty.. taking him out for fancy sushi and telling him everything I did.. then showing him the amount in our bank account.. and telling him that we are looking for an apartment as soon as possible.. then getting to go to the store and getting a little furniture..
his heart would smile if it could... I can see it now. That is my dream to make my husband proud. He deserves this... working till early morning to late night.. not coming home to a home cooked mean but instead leftovers from a cheap fastfood place.. then having to sleep in a car seat that can't even go all the way back.. it breaks my heart.. it makes me feel like he should have never married me, instead listened to his family so he could at least sleep in a warm bed.
I know if I can make this happen for both of us...
 he'll be proud of me.. that's all I long for.
ã€€
What we go through:
We have to buy CHEAP food at fast food places, everyday.
We buy daily gym passes to take showers. $10 each.. and my husband gets one everyday because he works in hard labor and needs one /:
If we don't have money for it, we go to a car wash and use the sink to wash up in.
We use A LOT of gas because we're constantly looking for a new job for him..
We park outside hotels and starbucks to get internet ..like i'm doing now.
we have had to pawn everything valuable to us.. his xbox 360, our good laptop, we kept the crappy one.. lots of games and dvds.. we're down to the bone when it comes to having our nice stuff being sold.. we even had to pawn his wedding ring but we got it back when we pawned other stuff and used half his paycheck..
I don't want people feeling sorry for us.
I know we're EVEN LUCKY TO HAVE A CAR to sleep in. I know we're lucky to have money for FOOD. God blessed us with that.. but like I said,
I want to surprise my husband and make him proud.
 I know his heart would fill with joy if I got to do this for him.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><span style=""font-size: medium;"">WHAT IF THEY COULD HELP THEIR NEIGHBOURS??</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: medium;"">THE GETAHUN PROJECT</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">This story begins in a small town, an important historical site in north/central Ethiopia.  A</span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">fter  visiting Lalibela as a younger-aged backpacker, I discovered a depth of poverty unlike anything seen before.  The experience helped initiate an eventual decision to become a sponsor, for one of the area’s poorest families.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">By retirement, and realizing a different arrangement was needed, the following plan emerged.  I would finance construction of a small guest-house, to replace the sponsorship.  In hopes it could in time develop into more, than just a small business. That it would create resources, develop sustainability, and transfer this to the community.  With both the agreement, and cooperation of the family.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""> </span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: medium;"">It takes everybody to get at the roots of poverty:</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Our plan was for the empowering family to assist whatever way they could, the surrounding community’s serious, most essential needs.  With the added factor of a connected gardening plot, to help produce what was necessary, pass some of the benefit directly to least accessible, or those having unequal supports. A solution designed to improve overall living conditions. The local municipality provided lists of needs, the project could comply.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Situated just inside the northern town of Lalibela, THE GETAHUN PROJECT would have the potential to generate an adequate income, in addition to a suitable shelter, with a ready agricultural base. Lalibela being an important <span class=""GRcorrect"">centre</span> having strong <span class=""GRcorrect"">monasterial</span>, and historical roots.  A fact that overlooks a permeating poverty exhibited not only in the town, but the whole environs.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Here is what has been done to date:</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">A basic, 14-room structure, with attached gardening section.  Agricultural production was started, and is ongoing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">About 80 local people were hired, providing a living wage, between 2010 and 2011. Structural interior has been finished to rough form only. Wiring and <span class=""GRcorrect"">waterlines</span> were completed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Validity of <span class=""GRcorrect"">Project</span> can be confirmed through the following documents</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/getahunproject/x/552448?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Proof of Funding</a> </span></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Immediate Objectives</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">TO DEVELOP A SEPTIC SYSTEM</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">COMPLETE INTERIOR FINISHING – INCLUDING DOORS, WINDOWS, SOME ROOFING.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">QUANTITIES OF ARABLE SOIL TO BE HAULED TO SITE (SOIL IS ROCKY AND THIN) FOR MODIFICATION, EXPANSION, AND AGRICULTURE EXPERIMENTATION</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">LABOUR COSTS EXPECTATIONS</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">ESTIMATED COST ASSESSMENT, IN AMERICAN DOLLARS -- $35,000</span></li>
</ul><h3><span style=""font-size: medium;""> </span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The following are the  project plans, <span class=""GRcorrect"">ear-marked</span> for the community, and area:</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: medium;"">To improve <span class=""GRcorrect"">life situation</span> of orphanage members, and unattached seniors, now lacking supports, that would include c</span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">lothing and shoes for orphanage children, as well as children of poor families</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Grain-grinder machine targeted, for at least one rural village. Others will be targeted in the future, as funding becomes available. Farmers gain <span class=""GRcorrect"">opportunity</span> to grind their grain and seed-crops, freeing up time for farming activities. Crops are currently hauled via tough landscapes, entirely by foot, or by both foot and donkey, to an in-town grinder</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Procuring of pharmaceuticals, designated diarrhea and ulcer medications, that have chronic shortages, urgently needed for people eating or drinking sparingly, wrongly, and sometimes not at all. </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Assessment of water resources at village level, where unclean water is an ongoing issue. While this represents a main cause of diarrhea and stomach ulcers in out-lying villages where river water is used, it is also a recurring problem in Lalibela itself, and continually threatens lives</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Most rural settlements struggle with poor night lighting. The Getahun Project hopes to supply  compact lighting units, to deter villagers lighting fires by night, thereby decreasing ill effects of smoke inhalation.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span class=""GRnoSuggestion GRcorrect"">Getahun</span> Project intends to assist remote farmer children in education possibilities </span></li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Sustainability:</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Project goals are to be linked with receipts from the <span class=""GRcorrect"">guesthouse</span>, monastery tours, and possible restaurant and other tourist-related activities, connected with the <span class=""GRcorrect"">guesthouse</span>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Annual income creates job opportunities in both the <span class=""GRcorrect"">guesthouse</span>, and agricultural operations.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">REWARDS OR GIFTS (PERKS<span class=""GRcorrect"">)</span>--IN THE EVENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS  --</span></p>

WHAT IF THEY COULD HELP THEIR NEIGHBOURS??
 
THE GETAHUN PROJECT
This story begins in a small town, an important historical site in north/central Ethiopia.  After  visiting Lalibela as a younger-aged backpacker, I discovered a depth of poverty unlike anything seen before.  The experience helped initiate an eventual decision to become a sponsor, for one of the area’s poorest families.
By retirement, and realizing a different arrangement was needed, the following plan emerged.  I would finance construction of a small guest-house, to replace the sponsorship.  In hopes it could in time develop into more, than just a small business. That it would create resources, develop sustainability, and transfer this to the community.  With both the agreement, and cooperation of the family.
 
 
It takes everybody to get at the roots of poverty:
Our plan was for the empowering family to assist whatever way they could, the surrounding community’s serious, most essential needs.  With the added factor of a connected gardening plot, to help produce what was necessary, pass some of the benefit directly to least accessible, or those having unequal supports. A solution designed to improve overall living conditions. The local municipality provided lists of needs, the project could comply.
 
Situated just inside the northern town of Lalibela, THE GETAHUN PROJECT would have the potential to generate an adequate income, in addition to a suitable shelter, with a ready agricultural base. Lalibela being an important centre having strong monasterial, and historical roots.  A fact that overlooks a permeating poverty exhibited not only in the town, but the whole environs.
 
Here is what has been done to date:
A basic, 14-room structure, with attached gardening section.  Agricultural production was started, and is ongoing.
About 80 local people were hired, providing a living wage, between 2010 and 2011. Structural interior has been finished to rough form only. Wiring and waterlines were completed.
Validity of Project can be confirmed through the following documents
Proof of Funding 
Mayor's Endorsement
 
 
Immediate Objectives

TO DEVELOP A SEPTIC SYSTEM
COMPLETE INTERIOR FINISHING – INCLUDING DOORS, WINDOWS, SOME ROOFING.
QUANTITIES OF ARABLE SOIL TO BE HAULED TO SITE (SOIL IS ROCKY AND THIN) FOR MODIFICATION, EXPANSION, AND AGRICULTURE EXPERIMENTATION
LABOUR COSTS EXPECTATIONS
ESTIMATED COST ASSESSMENT, IN AMERICAN DOLLARS -- $35,000
 
The following are the  project plans, ear-marked for the community, and area:
 


To improve life situation of orphanage members, and unattached seniors, now lacking supports, that would include clothing and shoes for orphanage children, as well as children of poor families

Grain-grinder machine targeted, for at least one rural village. Others will be targeted in the future, as funding becomes available. Farmers gain opportunity to grind their grain and seed-crops, freeing up time for farming activities. Crops are currently hauled via tough landscapes, entirely by foot, or by both foot and donkey, to an in-town grinder
Procuring of pharmaceuticals, designated diarrhea and ulcer medications, that have chronic shortages, urgently needed for people eating or drinking sparingly, wrongly, and sometimes not at all. 
Assessment of water resources at village level, where unclean water is an ongoing issue. While this represents a main cause of diarrhea and stomach ulcers in out-lying villages where river water is used, it is also a recurring problem in Lalibela itself, and continually threatens lives
Most rural settlements struggle with poor night lighting. The Getahun Project hopes to supply  compact lighting units, to deter villagers lighting fires by night, thereby decreasing ill effects of smoke inhalation.
Getahun Project intends to assist remote farmer children in education possibilities 
 
Sustainability:
Project goals are to be linked with receipts from the guesthouse, monastery tours, and possible restaurant and other tourist-related activities, connected with the guesthouse.
Annual income creates job opportunities in both the guesthouse, and agricultural operations.
 
REWARDS OR GIFTS (PERKS)--IN THE EVENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS  --
 
THE GETAHUN PROJECT began a search operation some time ago, with the result being an accumulation of well selected articles chosen with worth, collectability, and variety in mind.  Most articles were gathered from locations throughout North Wollo and Lalibela vicinity, or nearby monasteries.  Some originated from more remote locations.  All articles are produced by competent craftsmen, are either new, or considerably older, with suitable values.  Those considered older are quite often of higher quality.  Articles are to be chosen randomly from each stock-pile, and by order of contribution, until stock runs out.  They are ready for shipment, from a Canadian location.
Gifts of $25 or more will be accompanied by two secret (Getahun) family recipes, with particular spice combinations unique to Lalibela area.  Recipes are mailed exactly as written. 
In lieu of money contributions, used clothing and shoes in various children's sizes, are extremely welcoming, as clothing in most adult sizes.  Lalibela is situated in the cool highlands, where warm clothing is appreciated.  Parcels can be sent c/o Abebe Getahun Family Project, Box 210, Lalibela, Ethiopia
Updated information with progress reports involving future building activities, in addition to our community efforts, will be posted on a website. Construction costs to be included, if project recommences.

<p><strong>FOLKS! HELP US OUT! $500 is the MINIMUM we need!! Support Queer and Trans* Artists of Color and QTPOC community building! Yeah!<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>FCQ! (For Colored Queers)</strong> is a community based Queer and Transgendered People of Color (QTPOC)-centered project. Currently, FCQ! consists of a blog where we hope to publish QTPOC work that is socially and politically relevant to our diverse communities, through addressing social, racial, gendered, economic, and Queer justice. Additionally, FCQ! is producing a performance series featuring QTPOC artists, addressing various themes as well as creating space for facilitated dialogue around those themes. The first evening of performance is set for March 2, 2013, and is focused on issues of Colonization and Survival. We recognize the paucity of QTPOC-centered spaces, and aim for FCQ! to play a role in filling a need within our communities, by becoming a tool for social and creative justice, radical healing and politics, and genuine community building.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We need a minimum of $500.00 to cover expenses for renting a space and equipment to make this first event happen. Given that we are otherwise doing this out of pocket, having a starting budget will take a load off our backs as far as getting this project started.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ideally, we'd love to raise $1000 or more to be able to pay the artists a stipend as well. Raising this money before the show would allow ticket sales to go towards the next FCQ! event, therefore creating a more sustainable cycle of moneyflow for the project.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What you get:</div>
<p>For $10: mention in program</p>
<p>For $25: mention in program and personalized art-postcard mailed to you by FCQ! members</p>
<p>For $50: the above plus FCQ mini-poster with original design by FCQ! members mailed to you</p>
<p>For $75: all of the above plus mention in program and FCQ mini-poster with original design by FCQ! members, and hard copy of Panda Army’s upcoming ep</p>
<p>For $100: all of the above and FCQ! T-shirt</p>
<p>For $200: all of the above plus personal photo shoot with Heidi Andrea Restrepo Rhodes including digital copies of your portraits, and 3 8x10 + 3 5x7 printed hard copies of images of your choice</p>
<p>For $200: All of the awards for the $10-$100 levels, plus a hand-made wallet. You choose your favorite comic strip and Thao P. Nguyen will build you an a wallet using paper and packing tape. Trust me, you will LOVE it and your friends will be so jealous. Such celebrities as W. Kamau Bell (from the FX hit show Totally Biased) are proud owners of Thao's custom-made wallets.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Queer and Trans* People of Color need more spaces that are centered on our needs, our healing, justice in our communities. We need more spaces where our voices can be heard, where our politics can rail, where our love can glow. By investing in intellectual, creative, and literary art, as well as anti-oppression-based dialogue, by QTPOC, for QTPOC, we are reinforcing the fact that our communities matter, that we are talented and powerful and should be heard, and that social change begins in small but meaningful ways that change us and our worlds.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>We recognize that not everybody can contribute financially. and we appreciate your support in so many forms! If you would like to help in other ways, please check out the following ideas!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Your favorite neighborhood video store needs you help! The staff of Four Star (Nick, Helen, Lewis, Matt and Andy) are trying to buy the store from the current owner and become a cooperative. Unfortunately, none of us have enough money to buy the store outright. That's where you come in! We need to raise funds immediately so we can renegotiate our lease at the end of April. We operate at a solid profit, but, after thirteen years of dedication, the current owner is ready to move on to other things. If you want this Madison cultural landmark to stick around, start breaking open those piggy banks!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need around $50,000 for our initial investment. In addition to the store becoming a worker cooperative, we will redouble our efforts to get even more of the movies you want! We also have a lot of cool store memorabilia and prizes, like mugs, t-shirts, the potential to get your name up in the store or even on a rental case! We are also committed to welcoming the community into the store with events and community outreach.<br/><p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Madison's best video store will remain open for you to get every movie your heart desires. We all get to keep working at a place we really believe in. We will be a co-operative which means that we will be in total control and will listen to what you want!<br/><br/><p></p>

Please be sure to include an email address or other contact information with your donation.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Bobby and the Martins are my parents.  They retired from ministry a couple of years ago as they both suffer health issues.  Dad is a diabetic suffering from renal failure and has dialysis three days a week.  Mom suffers from congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>They have been living with me while recovering and trying to get their health back.  They are now well enough to go back home but their home is in need of major repair.  Storms damaged the roof which caused water damage inside as well.  They could not afford home insurance as they are both on fixed incomes.  Both are in wheel chairs and need a wheel chair accessible bath and shower. </p>
<p>It is important for their morale that they move back home.  The elderly crave their independence, and with home health they can live out their final days in their own home if we can make it happen.  Any help would be greatly appreciated as I try to give my parents the dignity they deserve.</p>

<h3>Fresh Eggs from Happy Chickens</h3>
<br/>
<p>We are Rodger and Isabelle Phillips from Farmington, Connecticut. Together with our four children our family farm raises certified organic vegetables for our Community Supported Agriculture program, our farm shop and farmers markets.<br/></p>
<p>We have been keeping our own small flock of chickens for the family for the past ten years. We love raising happy, healthy birds out on pasture where they can scratch and eat fresh greens and just be chickens. Pasture raised eggs contain 20 times more healthy omega-3 fatty acids than their less fortunate factory-raised cousins.  They are the tastiest most nutritious eggs you will ever have!</p>
<p>We have eggs for us but why stop there? We want to share our passion for delicious, clean food with the rest of our friends and neighbors! We plan to increase the size of our laying flock from the 25 birds we have today to 250+ birds this year and share these delicious eggs. This project is so important to us and will really benefit the farm and our community. But we need your help!<br/></p>

<p>We are Lisa from Germany and Karo from the Netherlands/Australia. I, Lisa am 27 years old, i have a Master in Clinical Psychology and specilisation in Mindfulness. Karo, 36 years old, is an Animal Rights Activist, Jivamukti Yoga Teacher and International Vegan Chef. We met in Sydney Australia about two years ago. Since then our common interests and passion have been growing towards the same direction and eventually lead to the birth of our project “Foodprintz: Food, Yoga and Education”. </p>
<p>With Foodprintz we are combining vegan food, (jivamukti)yoga and meditation practice and education on healthy, cruelty-free alimentation and a mindful way of living. We are both located in Lisbon, Portugal and for the past year have been organizing cooking workshops, yoga and meditation classes and retreats and most recently even a Pop-up Cafe in one of Lisbon’s best known vegan restaurants. We have found ourselves a permanent location where we will open Foodprintz Cafe, our own space where all three aspects of Foodprintz will be acommodated under one roof. This has been our dream for such a long time and we are excited about the journey ahead. Karo is currently teaching classes at The Mantra Yoga Lounge, a beautiful little Yoga space and Asram in central Lisbon but the classes are starting to grow out of it. So it is about time that Foodprintz Cafe starts running! With this campaign we are raising funds for the renovations and equipment for our space. We have a light-flooded ground floor that will be turned into a daily running, vegan cafe with a semi-open kitchen, a spacious basement that will be transformed into a peaceful yoga and meditation space and a private outside terrace that will be turned into a city oasis! The bases are covered but we need your support to turn this into that special place that we have imagined for so long.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
</div><p></p><p>To set our project on stable feet from the beginning we will need an entire budget of 47.000 Euros. Of this ideal budget, 30.000 are already self financed and will flow into the intial renovations, building an extra toilet and the kitchen. Also the basic kitchen equipment and furniture for the cafe is included in this budget. With the budget we already have we can open the cafe and have our kitchen up and running for customers.The 17.000 Euros that we set as a goal will go into two main budgets: the first budget is for the renovations and equipment of the basement. The basement has only been used as a storage facility by past owners. Such a shame since it has so much potential! We want to run daily evening classes of Jivamukti Yoga and meditation here. To make it that cosy place we are aiming for we need to:</p><p><br/></p><ul>
<li>place the floor: We want to go for a high quality vinyl floor here! It needs to have good grip for the yogamats and be resistent to a lot of movement and shifting. Of course easy cleaning is a must. After all Jivamukti Yoga Classes tend to get sweaty. We are calculating about 2000 Euros to cover the whole floor.<br/>
</li>
<li>renovate the walls: the basement has only been used so far as a storage room for the former clothing stores that have been housed here. We will spend around 3000 Euros in the renovation and painting of the walls<br/>
</li>
<li>replace the entrance to an old escape stair from the ground floor with glass: there is a round cut out in the ceiling of the basement that used to be a circular staircase to the ground floor. It is now covered with wood, we want to replace the wood with a round glass. We will have light from the ground floor coming through into the yoga basement this way. How deLIGHTful! This will cost us about 1000 Euros. </li>
<li>Place a divider: so far the basement is one big open space. Since the toilets are also located here, we would like to be able to divide and seperate the basement. We would also like to offer morning classes and be able to rent the yoga space to other teachers, massage therapists or other professionals. At the same time we would like to keep the space open to host movie nights or presentations. We will spend around 3000 Euros in a movable wall consisting of glass and wood on runners.</li>
<li>Equipment: We want to offer our students high quality yoga classes and for that we need “props”. This includes obviously yoga mats but also some blocks and belts. To help our students to become absolute super yogis we need around 500 Euros to start with.</li>
<li>An exit to the outside terrace: From the basement we will create an exit to the outside space aka our city oásis. For this we have to transform a window into a door. This will cost us about 1500 Euros.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>So we have spend 11.000 Euros of our aimed 17.000 Euros in the basement. The remaining 6000 will be our buffer for surprise costs. We are sure that everything is calculated for but every good budget takes unforseen costs into account!</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will get started on the basement with a new floor and walls but hold off with the divider and the glass ceiling so we can get our space ready for our students.</p><p></p><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Your contribution to Foodprintz means the world to us! It will make the difference for us to create a amazing space filled with love, good vibes and amazing cruelty-free food.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years we have witnessed a growing interest in a more healthy, sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle in many European countries, the US and also Australia. With this shift towards a greener and conscious way of life the “vegan boom” set off. People are looking for meatless alternatives and food free of animal products for many different reasons.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The number of vegetarian restaurants in Lisbon has been growing steadily within the last years. Most vegetarian places offer buffet-style food. The number of completely vegan eateries can be counted on the fingers of one hand though. There is no bakery with vegan options, which means for vegan pastry and cake you often have to turn to the pre-packaged sweets from the supermarket. A place where fresh, vegan meals and baked goods can be enjoyed in a cozy and homey atmosphere is missing.</p>
<p>
The holistic concept of Foodprintz is unique, combining Food, Yoga and Meditation. There is hardly any yoga studio that offers food at the same time (actually there is hardly any Yoga studio in Lisbon at all) and the other way around no cafe where you can also come for an after-work yoga class or group meditation. “Strong body, strong mind” is a quote that we all know yet we are often ignoring this body-mind connection. What we eat is affecting our physical health and our mental health and so is excercising the body and practice meditation. Jivamukti Yoga is the path to enlightenment through compassion for all beings, we can't think of a better method for Foodprintz. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With the cafe we will support local, Portuguese farmers and get our supplies straight from the country side. Portugal is a country with an incredible richness of fresh food all year round and we want to make use of that. To us it is important that our customers know and understand where the food on their plates (from seed to plate) is coming from and ideally know the name of the farmer who has grown their food. Also it is important to us that these local farmers get payed fairly for their products and not being pressured into dumping prices by the big supermarket chains.<br/>
A “wall of fame” with a portrait and biogrophy of our suppliers will be an absolute must of course!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Although this is the first time for us to set up a business together, we have been working and investing in Foodprintz for over a year now. We have hosted several events under the name of foodprintz: yoga and meditation retreats and vegan cooking workshops, we have been part of Lisbon Yoga Festival (Karo has been part of the festival twice teaching Jivamukti Yoga) and most recently we have been running a weekly pop-up cafe in Lisbon that has helped us raise some more funds for our space!<br/>
<br/>
Pre Foodprintz, Karo has been the Head Chef at the Sydney branch of the well-known vegetarian “Lentils as Anything” and ever since her Jivamukti Yoga Teacher Training in 2013 has been travelling extensively throughout Europe, Asia and Australia teaching Jivamukti Yoga, vegan cooking workshops, talks and seminars. She also wrote and published her own vegan cookbook in 2012 and has started her own vegan cheese line: GOPAL VEGAN CHEESE in December 2015. <a href=""http://www.karotak.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.karotak.com</a></p>
<p>Lisa took a more conventional path, majoring in Clinical Psychology and working as a Psychologist. She has ever since her graduation continued her studies on Mindfulness Meditation and Buddhist Mindfulness. Her years of experience in hospitality will definitely not hurt the project.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>We are very realistic about the risks of our operation “Foodprintz Cafe”. Although we both have the experience and skills and passion and creativity that all the different aspect of Foodprintz require to run smoothly, it is the first time for us to start our own business in the form of a cafe. A permanent spot for Foodprintz comes along with many costs, costs that we can oversee, count on and already incorporated into our budget plan. However, there may also be costs coming along the way that we did not anticipated. </p>
<p>It is always a challenge for a starting business to create a loyal group of customers. Our biggest challenge is to get people in, to tickle their sense of adventure and come through the door. For this, the unique concept of Foodprintz can be a blessing as much as a curse. A blessing, because we will have the initial support of people that believe in this concept. People that are looking for healthy, vegan food and a place to practice mindfulness and relax from the daily hustle and bustle. Through our workshops, retreats and yoga classes over the last months we already managed to draw that group of people in. We saw the number of participants and supporters of our events grow steadily. Also we are counting on an influx of tourists and locals looking for vegan and vegetarian food and yoga studios. Once open, we will make sure to have a great web presence and appear on the relevant social media channels (our facebook and instagram page is getting close to 600 likes/ followers), Happy Cow, Trip Advisor, Yelp and more. We also have been sending out newsletters and we have a growing mailing list. </p>
<p>At the same time, there is a big group of people out there, that haven’t been in touch with us yet. Due to the specific concept of Foodprintz there is an enitre potential client group out there that has not heard from us yet. Our location is in a busy area of Lisbon, close to Marques Pombal with many offices and hotels at walking distance. We want to encourage people and give them some incentive to try out our concept. We will start with vouchers for the local offices and hotels of “Mindfulness Menus” offering free after work meditation classes with your meal and reduced prices for yoga classes. We are focused and will primarily teach JIVAMUKTI YOGA <a href=""http://www.jivamuktiyoga.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.jivamuktiyoga.com</a></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div><p>We are totally amazed by the number of- sometimes unknown- people that have offered their help and support in a non-financial way. Since it is just us pulling this project off the ground, we can use every helping hand and we are so grateful for all the support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to see Foodprintz thriving and would like to support us in a different, non-financial way, here are some ways you can do so. We have different little “projects” that we could use some help with. If you are interested in any of them, if you have the skills for a specific project please get in touch with us and let us know!<br/>
<br/>
The first thing everyone can do and that will help us enormously is SHARING this campaign :) whether you are in Lisbon, elsewhere in Europe or on the other side of the world: please share our campaign and tell other people about our project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>“Project” 1: Donating equipment</p>
<p>This is not so much a project that requires certain skills as it is more an appeal to all of you have residual “stuff” lying around. We are looking for plates and cutlery and furniture that may be hiding away in basements, garages or in your grandma’s overfilled apartment. If you have anything to give away please get in touch. We love pre-loved stuff, like anything in life they deserve a second chance! Rather than buying new chairs, tables, plates etc. we are much happier recycling what is already there.</p>

We are Lisa from Germany and Karo from the Netherlands/Australia. I, Lisa am 27 years old, i have a Master in Clinical Psychology and specilisation in Mindfulness. Karo, 36 years old, is an Animal Rights Activist, Jivamukti Yoga Teacher and International Vegan Chef. We met in Sydney Australia about two years ago. Since then our common interests and passion have been growing towards the same direction and eventually lead to the birth of our project “Foodprintz: Food, Yoga and Education”. 
With Foodprintz we are combining vegan food, (jivamukti)yoga and meditation practice and education on healthy, cruelty-free alimentation and a mindful way of living. We are both located in Lisbon, Portugal and for the past year have been organizing cooking workshops, yoga and meditation classes and retreats and most recently even a Pop-up Cafe in one of Lisbon’s best known vegan restaurants. We have found ourselves a permanent location where we will open Foodprintz Cafe, our own space where all three aspects of Foodprintz will be acommodated under one roof. This has been our dream for such a long time and we are excited about the journey ahead. Karo is currently teaching classes at The Mantra Yoga Lounge, a beautiful little Yoga space and Asram in central Lisbon but the classes are starting to grow out of it. So it is about time that Foodprintz Cafe starts running! With this campaign we are raising funds for the renovations and equipment for our space. We have a light-flooded ground floor that will be turned into a daily running, vegan cafe with a semi-open kitchen, a spacious basement that will be transformed into a peaceful yoga and meditation space and a private outside terrace that will be turned into a city oasis! The bases are covered but we need your support to turn this into that special place that we have imagined for so long.
   What We Need & What You Get 
To set our project on stable feet from the beginning we will need an entire budget of 47.000 Euros. Of this ideal budget, 30.000 are already self financed and will flow into the intial renovations, building an extra toilet and the kitchen. Also the basic kitchen equipment and furniture for the cafe is included in this budget. With the budget we already have we can open the cafe and have our kitchen up and running for customers.The 17.000 Euros that we set as a goal will go into two main budgets: the first budget is for the renovations and equipment of the basement. The basement has only been used as a storage facility by past owners. Such a shame since it has so much potential! We want to run daily evening classes of Jivamukti Yoga and meditation here. To make it that cosy place we are aiming for we need to:
place the floor: We want to go for a high quality vinyl floor here! It needs to have good grip for the yogamats and be resistent to a lot of movement and shifting. Of course easy cleaning is a must. After all Jivamukti Yoga Classes tend to get sweaty. We are calculating about 2000 Euros to cover the whole floor.

renovate the walls: the basement has only been used so far as a storage room for the former clothing stores that have been housed here. We will spend around 3000 Euros in the renovation and painting of the walls

replace the entrance to an old escape stair from the ground floor with glass: there is a round cut out in the ceiling of the basement that used to be a circular staircase to the ground floor. It is now covered with wood, we want to replace the wood with a round glass. We will have light from the ground floor coming through into the yoga basement this way. How deLIGHTful! This will cost us about 1000 Euros. 
Place a divider: so far the basement is one big open space. Since the toilets are also located here, we would like to be able to divide and seperate the basement. We would also like to offer morning classes and be able to rent the yoga space to other teachers, massage therapists or other professionals. At the same time we would like to keep the space open to host movie nights or presentations. We will spend around 3000 Euros in a movable wall consisting of glass and wood on runners.
Equipment: We want to offer our students high quality yoga classes and for that we need “props”. This includes obviously yoga mats but also some blocks and belts. To help our students to become absolute super yogis we need around 500 Euros to start with.
An exit to the outside terrace: From the basement we will create an exit to the outside space aka our city oásis. For this we have to transform a window into a door. This will cost us about 1500 Euros.


So we have spend 11.000 Euros of our aimed 17.000 Euros in the basement. The remaining 6000 will be our buffer for surprise costs. We are sure that everything is calculated for but every good budget takes unforseen costs into account!
If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will get started on the basement with a new floor and walls but hold off with the divider and the glass ceiling so we can get our space ready for our students.
The Impact 
Your contribution to Foodprintz means the world to us! It will make the difference for us to create a amazing space filled with love, good vibes and amazing cruelty-free food.


Over the last couple of years we have witnessed a growing interest in a more healthy, sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle in many European countries, the US and also Australia. With this shift towards a greener and conscious way of life the “vegan boom” set off. People are looking for meatless alternatives and food free of animal products for many different reasons.


The number of vegetarian restaurants in Lisbon has been growing steadily within the last years. Most vegetarian places offer buffet-style food. The number of completely vegan eateries can be counted on the fingers of one hand though. There is no bakery with vegan options, which means for vegan pastry and cake you often have to turn to the pre-packaged sweets from the supermarket. A place where fresh, vegan meals and baked goods can be enjoyed in a cozy and homey atmosphere is missing.

The holistic concept of Foodprintz is unique, combining Food, Yoga and Meditation. There is hardly any yoga studio that offers food at the same time (actually there is hardly any Yoga studio in Lisbon at all) and the other way around no cafe where you can also come for an after-work yoga class or group meditation. “Strong body, strong mind” is a quote that we all know yet we are often ignoring this body-mind connection. What we eat is affecting our physical health and our mental health and so is excercising the body and practice meditation. Jivamukti Yoga is the path to enlightenment through compassion for all beings, we can't think of a better method for Foodprintz. 


With the cafe we will support local, Portuguese farmers and get our supplies straight from the country side. Portugal is a country with an incredible richness of fresh food all year round and we want to make use of that. To us it is important that our customers know and understand where the food on their plates (from seed to plate) is coming from and ideally know the name of the farmer who has grown their food. Also it is important to us that these local farmers get payed fairly for their products and not being pressured into dumping prices by the big supermarket chains.
A “wall of fame” with a portrait and biogrophy of our suppliers will be an absolute must of course!


Although this is the first time for us to set up a business together, we have been working and investing in Foodprintz for over a year now. We have hosted several events under the name of foodprintz: yoga and meditation retreats and vegan cooking workshops, we have been part of Lisbon Yoga Festival (Karo has been part of the festival twice teaching Jivamukti Yoga) and most recently we have been running a weekly pop-up cafe in Lisbon that has helped us raise some more funds for our space!

Pre Foodprintz, Karo has been the Head Chef at the Sydney branch of the well-known vegetarian “Lentils as Anything” and ever since her Jivamukti Yoga Teacher Training in 2013 has been travelling extensively throughout Europe, Asia and Australia teaching Jivamukti Yoga, vegan cooking workshops, talks and seminars. She also wrote and published her own vegan cookbook in 2012 and has started her own vegan cheese line: GOPAL VEGAN CHEESE in December 2015. www.karotak.com
Lisa took a more conventional path, majoring in Clinical Psychology and working as a Psychologist. She has ever since her graduation continued her studies on Mindfulness Meditation and Buddhist Mindfulness. Her years of experience in hospitality will definitely not hurt the project.   Risks & Challenges  
We are very realistic about the risks of our operation “Foodprintz Cafe”. Although we both have the experience and skills and passion and creativity that all the different aspect of Foodprintz require to run smoothly, it is the first time for us to start our own business in the form of a cafe.

own happiness, then you are already a MAD genius. Inspire and be inspired, and
help us create hoozMAD, an international short film competition designed to
increase the number of people who are Making A Difference (MAD) in the world.
 
If

default spreads around the world we live in.
 
hoozMAD.com will be inviting people to create short films which focus on what’s good
about the world, and 
thus create an environment where good things can grow and
expand.

FUNDING
TARGET - VOTING FOR POSITIVE CHANGE
 
The
initial target is $50,000 which will be used for creating a hoozMAD BETA
site to be launched on or before 1 August 2011. The sooner we reach our target
the sooner we can make this happen.
 
We
are also in the midst of filming our own short film to launch hoozMAd, so some
of the funds will be used for  the production. We will deliver each scene as we finish it to our hoozMAD fans first...All you need to do is contribute at least $1 to be a fan.  
 
Your

So by sharing your cash you are in fact breathing life into the concept.  You are creating proof that hoozMAD.com is
already working. Every dollar is a vote for making a difference through film.
Every dollar is a vote to inspire positive content for each other now and for
the future.
 
HOW THE MONEY WILL BE USEFUL
 
Development
of the online experience (site), feeding designers, coders, and other essential
team members needed to build the experience. Providing cash flow to the people
who create the structure and the form to make things happen, the organisers/adminstrators
. Fuel for the road show, we need to market this concept to find partners to
participate and help grow this for everyone’s benefit. Plus we need to help  the legal fraternity send their kids to
private schools, :-) you know …trade marks, copyright etc.
  
SUMMARY
 
Funds
will be invested in building the hoozMAD Beta experience to be launched on or
before 1 August 2011.
 
Proof
of concept! Your support says volumes to
potential sponsors, patrons and partners from around the world. The more people
that commit to this concept through a money link, the more powerful and
compelling the message. Money attracts more money!

You
will be adding oxygen to the MAD spark of hoozMAD.

Most
of all you will be taking action to Make A Difference, you will be certifiably M.A.D.

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP

But FabuLegs is special.  It's my own invention that helps cover imperfections and make your legs look beautiful!  I have created the product, packaging, labels and website...and have been selling online for several months. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>However, I really have not had the funds to market this product properly. This funding campaign would help me bring this product to its full fruition and get it into the market.</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need / How Funds Will Be Used</h3>
<p>It's pretty straight forward. We need money for marketing and promotion.  We'll be using the funds for the following types of strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online advertising (PPC, CPM and CPL campaigns).</li>
<li>Building an affiliate program and campaigns.</li>
<li>Press and publicity.</li>
<li>Event marketing (fashion shows, festivals, etc.).</li>
<li>Social Media Marketing.</li>
<li>Other marketing strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""_mce_tagged_br"">We feel we need at least 12,000 to make an effective splash for our product. The more funding, the more we can do. We expect to be able to use 80% of the funds for advertising and media (and related services) and 20% for infra-structure and management of our marketing efforts.</p>
<p class=""_mce_tagged_br""> </p>

<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>We are offering products, goodies and, most important, a chance to become part of our advertising campaigns by appearing in our ads.  You don't heve to have perfect legs to appear -- just a willingness to show them off and become a FabuLegs girl.</p>
<div>Here's an example of our ads (this could be you)...</div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>We are Hannah Owen and K.C. Clifford, two girls who want to make a difference just like you. For the last several months, we've gotten to know a young lady who comes from poverty. She is college-age, living here in Oklahoma on an athletic scholarship. She is the first in her family to go to college. When she came here for school this Fall, she left behind her vehicle so that her mom could continue to work to provide for the 9 family members living in their two-bedroom home. We are choosing to keep her identity private, in the best interests of her and her family. She has asked us for nothing. We just want to help.<br/><br/>Our hope is that you would partner with us to send her home for the holidays, to put an abundant meal on the family's table, and to provide a few gifts for each family member. Big meals and presents have never been an option for this family. We hope they can be this year.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For most of us, Christmas is a time of giving and receiving, enjoying riches we often take for granted. We know many of you have generous and compassionate hearts, and that's why we're reaching out to let you know about this opportunity to change the course of another family's holiday season.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Her mother, a single mom, works 7 days a week, 14 hours a day to barely provide the basic necessities for her family. If we don't succeed, this student will not be home with her family for Christmas, and they will go without another year.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is in 3 parts: Travel, food, gifts. If we are able to raise $1,000 or more, with your help we will provide all 3 parts of this vision for the family. If we fall short of our goal, we will prioritize travel first, food second, and gifts third. We sincerely hope you will join us in providing all three!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We plan to purchase a plane ticket for her to go home, estimated between $500-600. We are contacting a grocery store in her hometown to deliver food for the 9 family members for Christmas, estimated around $200. The rest of the funds will be divided for gifts, beginning with the small children in her family.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What do you get? The reward that comes with giving to those in need.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>You can give as little as $1 or as much as you want! We do understand not everyone can give, especially at this time of year. If you can't give financially but still want to help, you can do so by using the ""Share"" tools on our profile page to spread the word via email, Facebook and Twitter! You can make a difference!<br/>

de Janeiro is in a State of Emergency.
Urban
planning in Rio de Janeiro has historically been a tool of social
exclusion, segregation, displacement, violence, control and
gentrification in the name of ""progress"" and ""development.""
For the past century, under the paradigms of modernist urbanization
and ever-growing capitalism, the city has undergone a process of
obscuring poverty through the eradication of communities that
officials have deemed marginal and the appropriation of urban space
based on elitist and foreign interests. In recent years, this pattern
has been accelerated and strengthened as all levels of Brazilian
government have adopted the pursuit and production of Mega-events
in
Rio--
the 2007 Pan American games, the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics—as
a way of imposing its neo-liberal urban development project. 







Unlike
many other cities that have hosted Mega-events, Rio is defined by
profound social inequalities and a history of exclusion.
As the city polishes its image for the foreign eye and makes plans
for new stadiums, roads, hotels and other related infrastructure to
accommodate the Mega-events, hundreds of lower class neighborhoods in
Rio are being demolished and evacuated. Most of the affected
communities are being dislocated without prior notice, fair
compensation, or participation in the resettlement process, resulting
in homelessness and displacement of families and individuals from
their homes, jobs, communities, basic services and livelihoods.



My
Story. My
name is Bárbara de Paula da Silva. I am an activist, a multi-media
artist, a Rio de Janeiro native and currently a senior at Hampshire
College in Amherst, MA. I have been both studying and working on
issues relating to urban policy, environmental justice, identity
politics and immigration for the past years, and I am fully committed
to continuing my work in social justice and grassroots organizing. 





This
project is part of my senior thesis, ""Contested
Geographies: Control and Reclaiming of Urban Space in Rio de
Janeiro,"" which speaks to
the effects of the upcoming Mega-events on the geography of the city,
the rupture and displacement of communities and the struggles and
strategies of grassroots resistance. 




“Contested
Geographies” is a three-pronged thesis, consisting of a written
critical analysis, a series of counter-maps and a multi-media
installation. 


For
all three parts of my thesis, I will need to be drawing from primary
resources: collected oral histories, ethnographic research and
compiled video footage in Rio de Janeiro. 




This
is where I need your help. 






The
Impact.


By
giving a donation to this project,  I will be able to travel to Rio
for six weeks to document the effects of the upcoming Mega-events on
the city at large and specifically on two communities that are
currently resisting threats of forced evictions and displacement:
Arroio Pavuna and Vila Mimosa.  Both of these case studies will
illustrate the ongoing process of gentrification and (therefore)
exclusion, violation, displacement, disempowerment and segregation of
marginalized communities under the guise of ""development"".
Moreover, they provide two different examples of the ways in which
communities are organizing and fighting back. 


There
is strength and power in the stories of these communities. This
project is a tool to connect access to resources/media with
collective stories of place-based activism so that we can unite to
create change.




What
I need.


The
goal of this campaign is to raise $2,000. All funding will go towards
the following:




-Round-trip
ticket to Rio de Janeiro for six weeks to conduct crucial research,

-Tapes,

The KosherSwitch® Model# KSC-US-1201 is a 120V Americas-ONLY version that requires an available A/C neutral wire for proper operation. See below & our website for details.







What is KosherSwitch®?
KosherSwitch® is innovative patented technology permitting the on-demand control of electricity on Shabbat, while making Sabbath desecration (Chilul Shabbos) impossible! KosherSwitch® is endorsed by leading Poskim & Orthodox Rabbis for use l'chatchila (ab initio). The KosherSwitch® Classic wall switch pays for itself by curbing wasted electricity, and is easy to install/use without programming (just wait for a green Status Light and flick the switch).Anyone who's observant experiences difficulties with electricity on Shabbat.  Our founder, Menashe Kalati, leveraged his 25+ years in technology expertise to create techno-religious solutions that enhance the observance and enjoyment of Shabbat & holidays.  After years of rabbinical consultations, R&D, and safety certifications, KosherSwitch® is finally here.  And you can take part in making it a reality... Together, we can improve the world, one KosherSwitch® at a time!

Why KosherSwitch®?


KosherSwitch® brings significant value to consumers and to institutions (houses of worship, hotels, hospitals, nursing homes) that deploy the technology as a value-adding amenity for their guests.





Endorsed/Blessed by leading Poskim & Orthodox Rabbis


Validating the Halachic permissibility for KosherSwitch® has always been our primary objective.  During years of development, we've been privileged to consult with many Torah giants, who have analyzed, endorsed, and/or blessed our technology and endeavors.  Some have even provided crucial guidance on key design elements! More details are available on our website: Endorsements / Responsa / Lectures. As stated for years on the Endorsements page of our website: ""Rabbinical text at the links provided may refer to varying degrees of permissibility, or contextual conditions ranging from l’chatchila (“a priori”) use at home to limited use within healthcare settings.""





KosherSwitch® Technology: How Does it Work?
Like many inventions, KosherSwitch® technology employs simple concepts to provide indispensable benefits. Our technology is employs complete electro-mechanical isolation, and adds several layers of Halachic uncertainty, randomness, and delays, such that according to Jewish law, a user’s action is not considered to have caused a given reaction.  Many Poskim & Orthodox rabbis have ruled that the KosherSwitch® is not even considered grama (indirect causation), involves no melakha (forbidden/creative act), and is therefore permitted for consumer use. When ""flicking"" a  KosherSwitch®, all we're doing is moving a single, isolated, piece of plastic!  More details are available on our website.

Hierzu ist jedes SUFF-Mitglied (Spende ab 5€) herzlich eingeladenen. Die Höhe der Spende spielt bei den Community-Treffen vor Ort im Stadion keine Rolle. Entsprechend der Spendenhöhe erhält jeder Förderer sein eigenes Profil auf <a href=""http://www.startups-fuer-fortuna.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.startups-fuer-fortuna.de</a>. Die Initiatoren von „Startups für Fortuna“ arbeiten zu 100 Prozent ehrenamtlich.</p>

Dass sich Jungunternehmer einer Stadt zusammenschließen, um den zweiten Verein am Platz finanziell im Namen einer ehrenamtlichen „Dachorganisation“ zu unterstützen, das gibt es so in Deutschland noch nicht.</p>
<p><b>MÄZEN SEIN</b>: Wer hat nicht schon mal darüber nachgedacht in der Haut von Roman Abramowitch, Dietmar Hopp oder eines ambitionierten Scheichs zu stecken und auf den Platz herunterzuschauen und seine Mannschaft spielen zu sehen. „Startups für Fortuna“ bietet einen kostensensiblen Einstieg ins Fußball-Sponsoring.</p>
<p><b>PRÄSENZ</b>: Jeder Förderer von „Startups für Fortuna“ erhält ein der Größe seiner Spende entsprechendes Profil auf <a href=""http://www.startups-fuer-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.startups-fuer-fortuna.de</a>. Außerdem winken weitere Vorteile, wie Sponsoring-Pakete, Freikarten, Medienpräsenz, bis hin zu Meet&amp;Greetz mit Spielern und Testimonials. Außerdem kann jeder, sowohl vor Ort als auch im TV, voller Stolz die eigene Stadionbande und weitere Aktionen begutachten.</p>
<p><b>IDENTIFIKATION</b>: Köln ist eine Stadt mit der man sich identifizieren muss. Ob Karneval, Dom oder - für einige - der Club aus Müngersdorf. Für einige aber auch nicht. Zum Beispiel für die, die jahrelang, auch in schlechten Zeiten, Fortuna Köln die Treue gehalten haben. Und was ist mit all denjenigen, die noch keinen eigenen Verein haben, aber nicht auf Geißböcke stehen. Und was ist mit all den Neu-Kölnern deren Herz für den Heimatverein schlägt? All die lädt „Startups für Fortuna“ ein sich zu engagieren und mit Fortuna zu identifzieren.</p>
<p><b>EHRENAMT</b>: Die Initiatoren von „Startups für Fortuna“ arbeiten ehrenamtlich.</p>
<p><b>NETZWERKEN</b>: Wenn sich Samstag für Samstag junge visionäre Unternehmer beim Kölsch zum Fußball gucken treffen, dann entstehen u.a. solche Ideen wie „Startups für Fortuna“. Wer weiß was noch für Ideen entstehen?</p>
<p><b>AB IN DIE CROWD-CLOUD</b>: Weil es nichts Besseres gibt, als mit anderen Startup-Kollegen biertrinkend Fußball zu gucken und im Anschluss zu networken oder ggfs. noch weiter zu ziehen.</p>

Liga-Fußball zu sehen und mindestens 19mal im Jahr gemeinsam zu jubeln, zu trauern und ganz nebenbei neue Ideen zu entwerfen. Beim recherchieren der Dauerkarten-Preise sind die beiden Freunde und Jungunternehmer dann auf das Thema Sponsoring gestoßen. Schnell war klar, dass ein Haufen Arbeit auf sie zukommen würde.

Kurzbeschreibung
„Startups für Fortuna“ (#SUFF) unterstützt den 3. Ligisten Fortuna Köln durch Bandenwerbung und weitere Sponsoring-Aktivitäten. SUFF ermöglicht Startups, Unternehmen & Fans den Einstieg in die Welt des Sponsorings. Wer hat nicht mal daran gedacht irgendwann in die Fußstapfen von Abramowitsch & Co zu treten. Auf www.startups-fuer-fortuna.de können die Förderer sich selbst und ihre Projekte präsentieren und/oder gemeinsam im Stadion networken.
Worum geht es bei Startups für Fortuna?
„Startups für Fortuna“ ist ein Zusammenschluss fußballaffiner Kölner Jungunternehmer, ambitionierter Einzelpersonen und Fans, die Fortuna Köln in der Saison 2014/2015 durch Sponsoring und ihre Anwesenheit im Südstadion unterstützen wollen. Zu jedem Heimspiel treffen sich die Förderer von „Startups für Fortuna“ in einem festgelegten Stadionbereich treffen, erkennen einander am SUFF-Button und haben so die Möglichkeit gemeinsam 19mal im Jahr - Kölsch trinkend - zu jubeln, zu trauern und ganz nebenbei neue Ideen zu entwerfen. Hierzu ist jedes SUFF-Mitglied (Spende ab 5€) herzlich eingeladenen. Die Höhe der Spende spielt bei den Community-Treffen vor Ort im Stadion keine Rolle. Entsprechend der Spendenhöhe erhält jeder Förderer sein eigenes Profil auf www.startups-fuer-fortuna.de. Die Initiatoren von „Startups für Fortuna“ arbeiten zu 100 Prozent ehrenamtlich.
Was sind die Ziele und wer die Zielgruppe?
Finanzielle Unterstützung von Fortuna Köln und Aufbau eines fußballaffinen Netzwerks Kölner Startups, Jungunternehmer und Fans, die sich gemeinsam auf der Seite www.startups-fuer-fortuna.de präsentieren.
Warum sollte man Startups für Fortuna unterstützen?
VISIONÄR SEIN: Teilnehmer von „Startups für Fortuna“ betreten Neuland im deutschen Profi-Fußball. Dass sich Jungunternehmer einer Stadt zusammenschließen, um den zweiten Verein am Platz finanziell im Namen einer ehrenamtlichen „Dachorganisation“ zu unterstützen, das gibt es so in Deutschland noch nicht.
MÄZEN SEIN: Wer hat nicht schon mal darüber nachgedacht in der Haut von Roman Abramowitch, Dietmar Hopp oder eines ambitionierten Scheichs zu stecken und auf den Platz herunterzuschauen und seine Mannschaft spielen zu sehen. „Startups für Fortuna“ bietet einen kostensensiblen Einstieg ins Fußball-Sponsoring.
PRÄSENZ: Jeder Förderer von „Startups für Fortuna“ erhält ein der Größe seiner Spende entsprechendes Profil auf www.startups-fuer-fortuna.de. Außerdem winken weitere Vorteile, wie Sponsoring-Pakete, Freikarten, Medienpräsenz, bis hin zu Meet&Greetz mit Spielern und Testimonials. Außerdem kann jeder, sowohl vor Ort als auch im TV, voller Stolz die eigene Stadionbande und weitere Aktionen begutachten.
IDENTIFIKATION: Köln ist eine Stadt mit der man sich identifizieren muss. Ob Karneval, Dom oder - für einige - der Club aus Müngersdorf. Für einige aber auch nicht. Zum Beispiel für die, die jahrelang, auch in schlechten Zeiten, Fortuna Köln die Treue gehalten haben. Und was ist mit all denjenigen, die noch keinen eigenen Verein haben, aber nicht auf Geißböcke stehen. Und was ist mit all den Neu-Kölnern deren Herz für den Heimatverein schlägt? All die lädt „Startups für Fortuna“ ein sich zu engagieren und mit Fortuna zu identifzieren.
EHRENAMT: Die Initiatoren von „Startups für Fortuna“ arbeiten ehrenamtlich.
NETZWERKEN: Wenn sich Samstag für Samstag junge visionäre Unternehmer beim Kölsch zum Fußball gucken treffen, dann entstehen u.a. solche Ideen wie „Startups für Fortuna“. Wer weiß was noch für Ideen entstehen?
AB IN DIE CROWD-CLOUD: Weil es nichts Besseres gibt, als mit anderen Startup-Kollegen biertrinkend Fußball zu gucken und im Anschluss zu networken oder ggfs. noch weiter zu ziehen.

<p>According to the American Frozen Food Institute, the average American eats 12 frozen meals a month, making frozen food meals a $9 billion per year industry. However, there are no frozen meals that represent soul food and Southern food, down-home cuisine that originated with African Americans in the Southern United States hundreds of years ago that is still a traditional favorite for African Americans and Southerners alike. </p>

<h3>Mouth Meets South™ - Why It Matters</h3>
<p>Step into your local grocer’s freezer aisle and you’ll see plenty of frozen pizza, chicken pot pies, and microwave dinner choices. There are American microwave meals. Asian frozen meals. Italian microwave meals. Greek microwave meals. Mexican frozen meals. East Indian frozen meals. Low-cal frozen meals. Gluten-free frozen meals. But there are no frozen meals that represent soul food and Southern food. You know, down-home cuisine.</p>
<p>I created Mouth Meets South™ to fill a significant void in the frozen meal grocery segment by bringing a variety of savory and delicious soul food frozen meals to grocers’ freezers for the first time in history.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Kiki Pertesis and I am the owner and practitioner of The Little Owl Spa. I offer massage therapy, skin care and waxing services. The spa opened 5 years ago on the 2nd floor of  an office building with very little visibility and accessibility. I originally opened the space in hopes of serving at most 4 clients a week. Amazingly, through word of mouth and great online reviews, the spa is now serving over 35 clients a week! I've had to hire another massage therapist to help  take on the new clientele.  The small 300 square foot space is not capable of receiving more than 1 client at a time. Initially, lack of a bathroom in the space, limited parking and only one treatment room, were not an issue. Now, with so many clients and new clients booking everyday, it is time for the Little Owl to flap its wings and fly!</p>
<p>I have been so blessed with our clientele at The Little Owl Spa. The clients feel more like family to me and I want to continue to treat them in a beautiful, healing environment that is more accessible and more comfortable. I want to expand the service menu and include more healing arts such as energy healing, eastern massage and body treatments. I am also looking into purchasing innovative skin care equipment to assist in anti-aging and acne solutions.   Jumping from a small 300 square foot space to a space that is 3 times the size is a huge leap and will need lots of focus, love and financial backing. We need help to make this happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need at least $10,000.00 to assist us with opening costs including construction and new equipment. We really want to make the new space very special, inviting and beautiful so that clients truly feel like they are transported and relaxed.</li>
<li>There are some awesome perks for your help! You can enjoy spa services once it is opened for your help!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What I have learned in the past 5 years is that people need spas. Not only to relax but to feel loved, cared for and treated kindly in an inspiring atmosphere. The Little Owl Spa truly works from the heart and combines knowledge of the services it provides with great customer care. When I opened the spa in 2011, I never imagined it would be serving 40 clients a week. The spa was intended on serving a few clients here and there which is why I placed it on the second floor of an office building.   Without any advertising, on-street appeal or store frontage it has outgrown it's space by word of mouth and great online reviews. </p>
<p>I truly believe that if the spa were in a more accessible location with better parking and more services it would grow even further. I will always maintain a very boutique style space to ensure individual care but a larger space would ensure that more clients are able to be treated in a more timely and comfortable manner. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have no fear of the success of a new location however there are still some challenges in finding it. I have some very precise desires for the new location. I would like the space to stay in the Poughkeepsie area to cater to it's current clientele. I am also looking for a space with sufficient free parking as well as wheel chair accessibility. Lastly, I need a space that is large enough to have a few more rooms but also affordable. I am constantly looking for all options whether that be to buy a place or lease and I know the perfect spot is just around the corner. The contributions for clientele and fans will really help widen the possibilities so that we can move soon and efficiently. </p>

<br/><p>The Benkadi Project began to make Biosand Water Filters and they quickly became one of the most effective tools available to improve health and reduce poverty. Guinea is one of the poorest countries in the world, where most people earn less than a dollar a day. Half the population lacks access to improved water sources, and contaminated water has led to epidemics of cholera and diarrhea.</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>The Guineans and Americans in the Benkadi Project worked together to create an efficient process for making biosand filters. Materials and molds are expensive, but Benkadi can assemble them and distribute them to those in need quickly and cheaply. In 2013, their first year making biosand filters, they made and distributed 68 filters, which will supply safe drinking water to 680 individuals for the next ten years. Already, they have obtained funding to make 200 filters for 2,000 people this year. With your help, they will expand their capacity even more. </p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><span>A <a href=""http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Biosand Filter (BSF)</a>is an adaptation of the traditional slow sand filter, which has been used for community drinking water treatment for 200 years. It is filled with layers of specially selected and prepared sand and gravel. The sand removes pathogens and suspended solids from contaminated drinking water. A biolayer of bacteria and other micro-organisms which grows in the top sand eats many of the pathogens in the water. </span></blockquote>

<br/></span></blockquote>
<h2>How the Money Will be Used</h2>
<p>100% of the money raised in the campaign will be used by the Motherland Rhythm Community to make and distribute biosand filters, or to build capacity for making and distributing biosand filters. Specific uses include:</p>
<p><b>Making more filters.</b> Each filter costs $300 to make. Since a filter provides clean drinking water for ten people for ten years, a biosand filter can give a person safe drinking water for less than a penny a day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
A
large, high quality <b>electric generator</b>. Currently, night work is
impossible due to lack of power. Ideally, the generator would be
large enough to power some of the welding work. Estimated cost:
$2,500-$5,000.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/828417/files/20140902055319-DSC_0027_2.jpg?1409662399"" src="""" style=""width: 279.7642015005359px; height: 421px;""/></p>
<p>Once
we have an adequate source of electricity, we would like to acquire
two to four <b>concrete shakers</b>, which will improve the quality of the
filters, reduce repairs and allow us to use our helpers more
efficiently. Estimated cost is $600-$1,000 per shaker, including the
cost of mounting the shakers to the existing molds.</p>
<p>
Additional
<b>filtering screens</b> to improve our current filtering systems which are
sifted by hand, and purchase additional mesh screens to expand this
process. Estimated cost: $1000 - $1,500</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/836069/files/20140905071708-DSC_0236.JPG?1409926628"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>Water storage tanks</b>. Water is essential for our production process, but our 3,000 litre tank is inadequate. Estimated cost: $1,500.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Additional <b>concrete molds</b>. More molds would allow us to make more filters, but they are expensive and challenging to make. In the past, they have taken one to two months to make, as our machinist has travelled from town to town following changing electricity availability. Estimated cost: $1,500 per mold.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/836086/files/20140905072119-DSC_0270_2.JPG?1409926879"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Reliable, used off-road vehicle</b>. Good roads are extremely rare in Guinea. A vehicle is essential both for acquiring supplies, and for delivering finished filters. The first filters made went to the nearest communities, and the vehicle will be even more important as we expand our impact. The Motherland Rhythm Community has already secured some funding toward the vehicle.</p>

The Benkadi Project began to make Biosand Water Filters and they quickly became one of the most effective tools available to improve health and reduce poverty. Guinea is one of the poorest countries in the world, where most people earn less than a dollar a day. Half the population lacks access to improved water sources, and contaminated water has led to epidemics of cholera and diarrhea.



The Guineans and Americans in the Benkadi Project worked together to create an efficient process for making biosand filters. Materials and molds are expensive, but Benkadi can assemble them and distribute them to those in need quickly and cheaply. In 2013, their first year making biosand filters, they made and distributed 68 filters, which will supply safe drinking water to 680 individuals for the next ten years. Already, they have obtained funding to make 200 filters for 2,000 people this year. With your help, they will expand their capacity even more. 

A Biosand Filter (BSF)is an adaptation of the traditional slow sand filter, which has been used for community drinking water treatment for 200 years. It is filled with layers of specially selected and prepared sand and gravel. The sand removes pathogens and suspended solids from contaminated drinking water. A biolayer of bacteria and other micro-organisms which grows in the top sand eats many of the pathogens in the water. 


How the Money Will be Used
100% of the money raised in the campaign will be used by the Motherland Rhythm Community to make and distribute biosand filters, or to build capacity for making and distributing biosand filters. Specific uses include:
Making more filters. Each filter costs $300 to make. Since a filter provides clean drinking water for ten people for ten years, a biosand filter can give a person safe drinking water for less than a penny a day.


A
large, high quality electric generator. Currently, night work is
impossible due to lack of power. Ideally, the generator would be
large enough to power some of the welding work. Estimated cost:
$2,500-$5,000.


Once
we have an adequate source of electricity, we would like to acquire
two to four concrete shakers, which will improve the quality of the
filters, reduce repairs and allow us to use our helpers more
efficiently. Estimated cost is $600-$1,000 per shaker, including the
cost of mounting the shakers to the existing molds.

Additional
filtering screens to improve our current filtering systems which are
sifted by hand, and purchase additional mesh screens to expand this
process. Estimated cost: $1000 - $1,500


Water storage tanks. Water is essential for our production process, but our 3,000 litre tank is inadequate. Estimated cost: $1,500.

Additional concrete molds. More molds would allow us to make more filters, but they are expensive and challenging to make. In the past, they have taken one to two months to make, as our machinist has travelled from town to town following changing electricity availability. Estimated cost: $1,500 per mold.



Reliable, used off-road vehicle. Good roads are extremely rare in Guinea. A vehicle is essential both for acquiring supplies, and for delivering finished filters. The first filters made went to the nearest communities, and the vehicle will be even more important as we expand our impact. The Motherland Rhythm Community has already secured some funding toward the vehicle.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

As Indiana's only by-donation yoga studio, we're able to offer yoga to absolutely anyone, regardless of income level. We're also proud to be the only yoga studio in the BRAG neighborhood! Thanks to your support, we've seen a need for a space of our own, so we're transitioning into a new studio right down the street from our current location. We're so excited to move into Binford Plaza, a strip that is home to popular spots such as Just Judy's cafe, Peak Fitness, and the newly-opened Blind Owl Brewery &amp; Kitchen! As we move into the new location, our schedule will be expanding to offer more in-demand classes. We've heard requests for more evening classes, more gentle/restorative classes, and more workshops. You guys ask, we listen and comply. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We're thrilled to also bring on local Yin enthusiast, Michelle Finch, for two monthly Yin workshops. Yin yoga is unique in that it uses props, breathing techniques and mindful muscle relaxation to open the body both physically and mentally. But, investing in good quality props is more than we can currently afford as our budget is pretty tight while we make the transition into the new studio.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our props supply is off to a good start. We have 30 or so blocks, a couple dozen straps, and we just bought 20 blankets. Here's what else we would like to get started:</p> <ul> <li>20 bolsters @ $50 each</li>
<li>10 (more) blankets @ $20 each </li> </ul>
<div>We have different contribution levels, based on how much you'd like to help us out. <i>Everyone who gives $10 or more will get their own eye pillow.</i>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Even if you're not into Yin yoga, you may find yourself using these props in our regularly-scheduled classes! It may not need explaining, but our Yoga with Props class needs a decent supply of quality props. And in our regular classes, blankets aren't just for keeping warm; they are used a variety of ways - from wedging under the hip in pigeon to aligning and supporting the neck in shoulder stand - and bolsters provide great support for prepping the body to open for more advanced postures, and for under the knees in savasana.</p>
<p>You may remember last August we crowd-funded the seed money needed to get our studio up and running. We kept it relatively simple, asking for just $5,000 to slap some paint on the walls and get the studio basics. You guys came through and fully funded us in just 45 days. We saw that you believed in us, and wanted to contribute to our cause. We're doing another campaign because we see a need for these restorative classes NOW (can the world slow down already?) and we'd rather not make you wait any longer for Yin to come to Breathing Space! We figure there are enough of you out there who are excited to have Yin at the studio (or at least you want an ample supply of all props for your other classes) and are willing to put some money in the pot to help get us set up. This is all part of Breathing Space being a COMMUNITY space of which everyone takes ownership.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We understand that asking for the community's help may not get us to our goal in just 30 days, and that's okay. We've set up this campaign to accept any amount that we raise. We'll get what we can now, and fill it all up as time goes on. Michelle can bring her own props to the Yin workshops, but that is a huge request for her to do every time since those bolsters are big and bulky...what a pain to lug back and forth twice each month! And trust us, our beloved Yin teacher is the last person we need out of commission! ;)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, due to a lack of dining space and the prohibitive cost of increasingly necessary repairs at our former location, we had no choice but to close Lorenzo's in June of 2015. </p>

<p>Over the past several months, we have been overwhelmed by requests to bring back your favorite Lorenzo's dishes, especially our Pizzas, Salads and Lasagna.

<p><strong>Here's the problem.</strong> <strong>In order for us to serve Pizza, Lasagna and a few of your other Italian favorites at Savannah's, we need to renovate and redesign our kitchen space. And that costs MONEY.</strong> </p>
<p>We invested quite a lot to build Savannah's (and our efforts have paid off - in just 5 short months we became the 2nd Best BBQ in Jefferson County!!) But we're tapped out, and we just don't have a money tree in our backyard. </p>

<strong>New Equipment:</strong> Including a pizza oven capable of cooking pizzas in less than 2 minutes, coolers, beer cooler, dough mixer and dishware.  </li> <li>
<strong>Restructuring the Kitchen Design at Savannah's.</strong> This will accommodate preparation of a wider variety of menu options. (Don't worry! All of our award-winning BBQ will still be on the menu too.)</li>
<li>
<strong>A New Dining Counter + Server Station.</strong> Yes, we plan to turn Savannah's into a sit-down restaurant with servers, wine and beer.  </li> <li>
<strong>More Jobs.</strong> We'll have to hire servers and additional kitchen staff, which means you'll help bring more jobs to De Soto. </li>

</div></div>","Wildthings 100% Natural, Wildly Effective, Insect Repellent 
Join the revolution in health and body care that returns us to the wisdom of nature.
We believe in keeping ingredients simple and pure.Our bug repellent is made from the highest quality essential oils,  which are both non-toxic and nourishing for the skin. Originally made as a safe and effective bug repellent for my own children, Wildthings is 100% natural, and contains no synthetic chemicals or artificial additives. And it is wildly effective!
Studies show that one of our ingredients, catmint , is stronger than DEET at repelling mosquitoes. Rose geranium, catmint and witch hazel  are known for their healing, soothing properties. Our essential oils are also commonly used in aromatherapy mixtures to bring a sense of calm and well-being. 
Working with essential oils means working with some of nature's most divine scents. Wildthings comes in 3 varieties: Lavender, Citrus Wildflower, and Forest, which has a hint of patchouli. 
Plants have been in the insect repelling business a few hundred million years longer than we have.  Our bodies have evolved alongside some of these powerful repellent plants in a symbiotic relationship, and perhaps it is no accident that many are plants whose scents are very appealing to us. But we have forgotten much of this basic plant wisdom and  have been led to believe that synthetic alternatives are vastly better. We don't believe that's true. Our goal is to reclaim our relationship with the beneficial and healing properties of plants. To re-wild our lives. To live in balance with nature.
***Wildthings  and our parent company, Cedarberry,  grew out of founder Monica Campbell's lifelong passion for herbal remedies and natural skin products. We believe that the products that you put on your skin, and on your children's skin, should be totally natural and as pure as possible. Using a blend of sustainably sourced essential oils known for their insect repellent properties, we craft our insect repellent and other body products in small batches using natural, plant-based ingredients that are not only highly effective, but also nourishing for your skin. First Steps...
By supporting our campaign, you will be helping us raise a little seed money to get  our business going. You will also get the opportunity to sample our products and offer feedback. But more importantly, you are part of a movement toward a healthier way of living in relationship with nature and a belief that the natural world has deep wisdom that we simply need to remember and tap into. 
Our immediate goal is to provide the best possible products and to raise awareness of the efficacy of natural ingredients.  These products are not only healthier for our bodies and the earth, but we believe that they actually work better  than the synthetic, toxic alternatives. Our future goals include creating insect repelling products for the home as well as pets, reducing the chemical load our bodies are exposed to on a daily basis. 

We've tested and fine-tuned our bugspray recipes, and we have a website, which will open for online business in early December, as soon as the fundraising campaign ends: 

wildthingsbugspray.com

Now we need your help to get production rolling! *  5% of the  proceeds from our fundraiser will be donated to support charities we love...  Arcadia Center for Sustainable Food and Agriculture and Panthera



What we offer you...

As perks we are offering Wildthings bugspray as well as some of the natural body products that will be offered through our parent company, Cedarberry. AND, because we know the mosquito season is drawing to an end in the northern states, and there's only so much bugspray you can use this time of year, we are also offering some ART, T-shirts, and other curiosities to sweeten the deal! 
Wildthings insect repellent has a good shelf life, and will have you ready for next summer, but you are welcome to opt for delivery in the spring.
**We can only ship Wildthings insect repellent within the United States at this point.Galleries for the ART perks will go up in early November, with links posted here, and art will be added through the end of the campaign on November 29. Contributors will be able to choose their artwork when the galleries open or any time until December 15. Most of the art is from potion maker and founder, Monica Campbell, but a few pieces may be from other artists.

</p><p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>In early 2013, we formed Exposure in downtown
Sioux Falls with the purpose to provide gallery and studio space to artists of
any discipline. In August, after experiencing issues with our building we decided to vacate our home. While Exposure was
in operation, we welcomed in hundreds of visitors every First Friday to check
out some wonderful local art and share refreshments with friends. Since then we've been searching for the perfect location to reopen Exposure and now we've finally found
it!<br/><br/>
Our new proposed space is nestled on the corner of 6th st. and Phillips Avenue. It's great location and large space provides the perfect venue for our artistic community. We'll be hosting
monthly art parties on the first Friday of every month, having artists talks and
critiques, and most importantly we'll have seven studio spaces for artists to
create work in.</p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>In order to get Exposure back up and running
we need help from you! Here's what we need to make the space great.</p>
<ul>
<li>New
     lighting in the gallery spaces (we need to install track lighting in order
     to properly light all the awesome artwork we plan on displaying)</li>
<li>A
     couple of new walls (we're tearing down a few walls and putting up
     new ones to create more space for our main gallery space)</li>
<li>Paint
     for the walls and ceiling</li>
<li>General fund for operational needs</li>
</ul><p><b>Why Should I donate?</b></p>
<p>The Sioux Falls arts scene is in an important
stage right now. There is a growing population of young artists in Sioux Falls, but those artists aren't going
to stick around if they don't have a place to show and sell their work.
Exposure will provide an outlet for artists to work, create and exhibit
their art. We aim not only to build up and support our art community,
but our downtown community as well. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help!</b></p>

In early 2013, we formed Exposure in downtown
Sioux Falls with the purpose to provide gallery and studio space to artists of
any discipline. In August, after experiencing issues with our building we decided to vacate our home. While Exposure was
in operation, we welcomed in hundreds of visitors every First Friday to check
out some wonderful local art and share refreshments with friends. Since then we've been searching for the perfect location to reopen Exposure and now we've finally found
it!
Our new proposed space is nestled on the corner of 6th st. and Phillips Avenue. It's great location and large space provides the perfect venue for our artistic community. We'll be hosting
monthly art parties on the first Friday of every month, having artists talks and
critiques, and most importantly we'll have seven studio spaces for artists to
create work in.
What We Need
In order to get Exposure back up and running
we need help from you! Here's what we need to make the space great.

New
     lighting in the gallery spaces (we need to install track lighting in order
     to properly light all the awesome artwork we plan on displaying)
A
     couple of new walls (we're tearing down a few walls and putting up
     new ones to create more space for our main gallery space)
Paint
     for the walls and ceiling
General fund for operational needs
Why Should I donate?
The Sioux Falls arts scene is in an important
stage right now. There is a growing population of young artists in Sioux Falls, but those artists aren't going
to stick around if they don't have a place to show and sell their work.
Exposure will provide an outlet for artists to work, create and exhibit
their art. We aim not only to build up and support our art community,
but our downtown community as well.

</div></div>","The William Kellibrew Foundation (WKF) is excited to host its second “Ball For Peace” Basketball Tournament & Showcase in collaboration with the Men of Code program and Friendship Collegiate Academy Football in Washington, D.C. This community event is an afternoon of fun dedicated to the awareness and prevention of gun violence, domestic violence, and sexual assault. This event brings together youth, educators, athletes, organizations, and community leaders.  All funds raised will support the event and WKF’s ongoing programmatic efforts to break the cycle of violence and provide resources to victims and survivors of trauma. What Is Ball For Peace? 
- 3-on-3 Basketball Tournamentfree for local students and open to all ages

- ""Celebrity"" Basketball Showcasefeaturing teachers, coaches, and local personalities competing in games and skills competitions

- Community Resource Fair local organizations addressing violence and trauma share and connect resources with those who need them most
Who?- The William Kellibrew Foundation, a D.C.-based nonprofit, hosts this event. - Student leaders from the Men of Code program (collectively known as the Knights of Adversity) help organize this event to fulfill their commitment to awareness and prevention of violence against women. The Knights of Adversity are selected members of the Friendship Collegiate Academy football team and have accepted their role as leaders in stopping sexual assault and domestic violence in their school and community.Y(our) ImpactThe summer should be a time of leisure and fun, but all too often, this is not the case for many youths. A lack of activities and resources to keep students engaged and an uptick in area violence and crime leaves many young people vulnerable. By contributing to this campaign, you are directly supporting a community event for students, strengthening measures to reduce neighborhood violence, and extending the reach of resources to those who need them most.  This is a fundraising community outreach event. The graph below demonstrates how the money will be used if we reach our $5500 online campaign goal. Because we wish to cover the majority of our event expenses through in-kind donations, this graph is subject to change. The more in-kind donations we receive from sponsors, the more money that will go towards program support. In-kind donations, ticket/registration sales, and other contributions may not be reflected on this page and help us reach our online campaign goal. We will share with supporters our total numbers and where it goes after the close of the event. Below is our best estimate:What expenses must be covered for Ball For Peace? 

Free registration for local students


Transportation to the venue for students who need it


T-shirts, gift bags, and prizes


Food and beverage


Referees

What types of programs will your money support? 

Monthly men's and women's circles


Young male engagement at Capital City Public Charter School

<p> We may not be the most polished in our video but we are having fun being back to basics and growing a sustainable business.</p>
<p>Seeking   a change to go back to my passions as a youth, simple farming, great beef and easy 1-2 -3 steps. We have started up and ran a number of successful businesses over  the last 40 years and are very excited about Frugie beef being our best yet.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/840318/files/20140907090047-As_a_Kid_Burnaby.jpg?1410105647"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Frugie beef is based on utilizing unused farmland and giving it new life. By removing fruits and vegetables as  food waste from land fills that doesn't need to be disposed of. Lastly to give a beef product that is beyond Grass fed and Organic raised beef in its healthy content. “We raise Healthy Happy cattle.”<span>  Our cattle<br/>are raised from our own calves or purchased from reputable farms that meet our<br/>requirement in our standards of ages, grass fed only, no anti-biotic, no<br/>hormone, or steroid use</span>, No Grain, No Corn, No Gluten...</p>
<p>Once cattle are under our standards program  using<br/>ethical and humane protocol full of daily hands on care we place them on our<br/>feeding program. We provide daily grazing with our selected hay and daily<br/>feedings of fresh fruits and vegetables. We are an Eco friendly company keeping<br/>500 + tons of fruits and vegetables out of landfills this last year and a half alone. We recycle all plastics and cardboard. </p>
<p>Some still have trouble believing cattle will eat fruits and vegetables but the<br/>proof is in our meat from its powerful antioxidant-rich ingredients</p>
<p>Our bullet points for Frugie Beef.</p>
<p>-  Frugie beef has minimal fat content and the fruit and vegetable diet detox’s the meat and tissue of toxins. Frugie beef 3X leaner, tender, moist and provides quality meat taste and texture.</p>
<p>-  Daily feedings of fresh fruit and Vegetables maximize the intake to our cattle of all<br/>natural vitamins, minerals and nutrients.</p>
<p>-  There is no grain fed into their diets giving us gluten free meat. “Grain Free Gluten Free”</p>
<p>-  We have not had any infections or unhealthy animals as they receive daily human care and feedings.</p>
<p>-  “We marinate our beef from the inside out.” </p>
<p>-  Our beef has a taste of its own, rich in flavour and tender with hints of vegetable and fruit flavors.</p>
<p>-  Our beef cooks much quicker as it is low  in fat. The juices in our meat when seared serve a delicious meat. Cooking tip- sear meat, high temp and lock in juices then lower heat, cook to desired doneness.</p>
<p>-  Frugie beef is high in heme iron very good for anemia suffers.</p>
<p>-  Frugie beef is high in conjugated linoleic acid - known as good CLA to read more. <br/><a href=""http://thyroid.about.com/cs/dietweightloss/a/cla.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thyroid.about.com/cs/dietweightloss/a/cla.htm</a> or<br/><a href=""http://knh.nfobits.com/interesting-research/8-fats-good-and-bad-conjugated-linoleic-acid-cla.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://knh.nfobits.com/interesting-research/8-fats-good-and-bad-conjugated-linoleic-acid-cla.html</a></p>
<p>-  WE LOVE WHAT WE DO AND BRING PASSION TO OUR ARTISANAL HEALTHY CHOICE BEEF. FRUGIE BEEF </p>
<p>-  “Wild game meat without the gamey taste.”</p>
<p>-  We are a specialized meat product and not available to high production services.   Our goal is to present to other cities and towns our certification standards and process.</p>
<p>-  We have our Frugie beef processed by a BC Certified Processor and cut and wrapped by our local Butcher.  </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.frugiebeef.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>Contributing to our campaign will allow us to scientifically test our beef as to why Frugie beef is beyond grass and Organic. Frugie beef (cattle) are fed fruit and vegetables daily for a maximum natural intake of Vitamins, Nutrients and Minerals. We want to test for all vitamin and nutrient content levels in our beef as well as the enzymes or protein enzymes of gluten if any in our beef. </p>

<p> A full report on our finding and interesting twists along our pilot project that has become a full time business. Lastly for those that see opportunity and want to seek a very rewarding fun and healthy business model. Please review our perks in detail.</p>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p> <ul>
<li>Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you. </li> <li>Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!</li> <li>Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help a lot to celiac, allergen and health issues. This can prove a product can be fed healthy and produce a even healthier food product to humans seeking healthy options.</p>
<p>We raise healthy - happy cattle in a humane and ethical standard with a resource that would be landfill bound on lands that people want to see farming but to busy or incapable of farming themselves.</p>
<p>Our 3 year pilot project has proved great things for our clients health and wellness. We have made great strides in protecting our planet and reducing waste. Now we want the documented truth by science which verify our beliefs that we have the healthiest beef for the world.</p>
<p> </p> <p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p> <ul>
<li>Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.</li> <li>Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).</li> <li>Make it real for people and build trust.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk is we stay small in our 100,000 populous and keep our light under a cover and only supply to the clients we have. This is not possible as word is travelling fast in the health world how anemia and allergen suffers are receiving our beef. We want to share our healthy beef with you.</p>
<p>The Challenges are we only raise enough money to get 1/2 the scientific results we need to document our beliefs and our clients truths how they feel after eating our enriched beef. We are very grateful for any monies raised to prove our beef is beyond grass fed and organic.</p> <p> People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.</p> <ul>
<li>Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles.</li> <li>Describe your plan for solving these challenges.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sometimes its not about money but sharing opportunities to friends or those in need. So please open your lists of contacts to our site and pray for those that seek relief from chronic pain or discomfort from allergies to meat or needs for higher levels of nutritional ingredients in their diet.</p>
<p>Please send out the word about Frugie beef that is worth more than money and please review all of Indiegogo's opportunities to share this project.</p> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.</li> <li>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul>
</div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary Hi we are Dwayne and Sue Lowdermilk owners of Frugie Beef. We have been hard at work for 3 years finalizing our pilot project. We also designed our certified feeding stands program.

Frugie beef is based on utilizing unused farmland and giving it new life. By removing fruits and vegetables as  food waste from land fills that doesn't need to be disposed of. Lastly to give a beef product that is beyond Grass fed and Organic raised beef in its healthy content. “We raise Healthy Happy cattle.”  Our cattleare raised from our own calves or purchased from reputable farms that meet ourrequirement in our standards of ages, grass fed only, no anti-biotic, nohormone, or steroid use, No Grain, No Corn, No Gluten...
Once cattle are under our standards program  usingethical and humane protocol full of daily hands on care we place them on ourfeeding program. We provide daily grazing with our selected hay and dailyfeedings of fresh fruits and vegetables. We are an Eco friendly company keeping500 + tons of fruits and vegetables out of landfills this last year and a half alone. We recycle all plastics and cardboard. 
Some still have trouble believing cattle will eat fruits and vegetables but theproof is in our meat from its powerful antioxidant-rich ingredients
Our bullet points for Frugie Beef.
-  Frugie beef has minimal fat content and the fruit and vegetable diet detox’s the meat and tissue of toxins. Frugie beef 3X leaner, tender, moist and provides quality meat taste and texture.
-  Daily feedings of fresh fruit and Vegetables maximize the intake to our cattle of allnatural vitamins, minerals and nutrients.
-  There is no grain fed into their diets giving us gluten free meat. “Grain Free Gluten Free”
-  We have not had any infections or unhealthy animals as they receive daily human care and feedings.
-  “We marinate our beef from the inside out.” 
-  Our beef has a taste of its own, rich in flavour and tender with hints of vegetable and fruit flavors.
-  Our beef cooks much quicker as it is low  in fat. The juices in our meat when seared serve a delicious meat. Cooking tip- sear meat, high temp and lock in juices then lower heat, cook to desired doneness.
-  Frugie beef is high in heme iron very good for anemia suffers.
-  Frugie beef is high in conjugated linoleic acid - known as good CLA to read more. http://thyroid.about.com/cs/dietweightloss/a/cla.htm orhttp://knh.nfobits.com/interesting-research/8-fats-good-and-bad-conjugated-linoleic-acid-cla.html
-  WE LOVE WHAT WE DO AND BRING PASSION TO OUR ARTISANAL HEALTHY CHOICE BEEF. FRUGIE BEEF 
-  “Wild game meat without the gamey taste.”
-  We are a specialized meat product and not available to high production services.   Our goal is to present to other cities and towns our certification standards and process.
-  We have our Frugie beef processed by a BC Certified Processor and cut and wrapped by our local Butcher.  
 Contributing to our campaign will allow us to scientifically test our beef as to why Frugie beef is beyond grass and Organic. Frugie beef (cattle) are fed fruit and vegetables daily for a maximum natural intake of Vitamins, Nutrients and Minerals. We want to test for all vitamin and nutrient content levels in our beef as well as the enzymes or protein enzymes of gluten if any in our beef. 

The second reason to contribute will help expansion of growth with equipment needs, marketing and sales growth in the health food market. Our clients who already realize the lower fat beef is good but also the health benefits of our beef.
We have had articles in The Globe and Mail  
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/food-trends/where-raising-beef-on-apples-and-herbs-is-truly-the-fruits-of-their-labours/article19201573/
Also Local Langley Times Newspaper as well as an up coming Article in the Western Producer.
Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section: 
Introduce yourself and your background. Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you. Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve. 
Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?   What We Need & What You Get We want to raise $25,000 to get our scientific testing done as well as purchase,  repair and improve our machinery needs.
$12,000 is to testing lab for our full request tests.
$8,000 for new sorting and grinding machines and repairs to vehicles to date.
$3,000 for information and awareness info re sales and marketing
$ 4,000 for gift rewards and mailing. 
These gifts are a part of our business, plus we are able to send world wide. We wanted to ship meat but at this time there are too many issues to ship world wide.
A heart felt email, Our designed decal to display, Apron the true farm accessory, Tee shirt to show Frugie beefs identity, Sample packs of Frugie beef smoked products for ease of shipping by Windsor Quality Meats, 

Dirt Bag Chef best rub you will ever taste on Frugie beef,  
                                    
 A full report on our finding and interesting twists along our pilot project that has become a full time business. Lastly for those that see opportunity and want to seek a very rewarding fun and healthy business model. Please review our perks in detail.
Break it down for folks in more detail: 
Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal. 
  The Impact
Your contributions will help a lot to celiac, allergen and health issues. This can prove a product can be fed healthy and produce a even healthier food product to humans seeking healthy options.
We raise healthy - happy cattle in a humane and ethical standard with a resource that would be landfill bound on lands that people want to see farming but to busy or incapable of farming themselves.
Our 3 year pilot project has proved great things for our clients health and wellness. We have made great strides in protecting our planet and reducing waste. Now we want the documented truth by science which verify our beliefs that we have the healthiest beef for the world.
  Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make: 
Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust. 
  Risks & Challenges
The risk is we stay small in our 100,000 populous and keep our light under a cover and only supply to the clients we have. This is not possible as word is travelling fast in the health world how anemia and allergen suffers are receiving our beef. We want to share our healthy beef with you.
The Challenges are we only raise enough money to get 1/2 the scientific results we need to document our beliefs and our clients truths how they feel after eating our enriched beef. We are very grateful for any monies raised to prove our beef is beyond grass fed and organic.  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal. 
Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. Describe your plan for solving these challenges. 
  Other Ways You Can Help
Sometimes its not about money but sharing opportunities to friends or those in need. So please open your lists of contacts to our site and pray for those that seek relief from chronic pain or discomfort from allergies to meat or needs for higher levels of nutritional ingredients in their diet.
Please send out the word about Frugie beef that is worth more than money and please review all of Indiegogo's opportunities to share this project. Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools! 
 And that's all there is to it.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

</ul>
<br/><p>Our project will feature an innovative orchard dedicated to teaching concepts of agrobiodiversity to students through heirloom California fruit varieties threatened with extinction. Adding to the diversity of our site are micro-plots that will consist of plants native to South Africa, the Mediterranean region, and California; these plots will demonstrate the diversity of plants native to the Mediterranean biome and will serve as an outdoor ecological laboratory directly supporting instruction in the university’s immensely popular Introduction to Biology course. In a book published by Smithsonian on Home Gardens and Agrobiodiversity, small-scale gardening is emphasized as an important provider of:</p>
<p><i>“microenvironments [...] that contain high levels of species diversity and may contain crop species or varieties of species different from those found in surrounding agroecosystems.”</i></p>
<p>This agrobiodiversity makes the BOG a valuable addition to the campus-wide transition towards sustainable landscaping which embraces lawn reduction and plantings more suitable for the teaching, outreach and research mission of the University. Once completed, the BOG will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>serve as a demonstration of and test site for plants and trees more suitable to the Central Valley region’s hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters, with a focus on drought tolerant plants less commonly available in the Sacramento Valley</p></li>
<li><p>Act as a living museum by preserving unique fruit varieties threatened by commercial extinction</p></li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The transformation of this underutilized and moribund section of the UC Davis campus began in April 2012. The planning team enhanced an initial undergraduate site concept to make the BOG available for visitors as well as UC Davis students to observe innovative usage of water-wise landscaping, as well as displays of uncommon flora. To create an engaging public garden, site grading and amendment, a proper low volume irrigation system, and accessible pathways are crucial additions to the site.  </p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439015389/lbkgfgc3p8w4cm2lodiz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Killoran Moore and I am going to be an urban flower farmer.  <br/><br/>I want to take<b> </b>disused land here in Victoria, be it people's yards or vacant lots, and use it to grow cut flowers to then sell at market and through a subscription service.  Using low/no-till, organic methods and keeping beneficial insects in mind I will grow many varieties you just can't find unless grown locally.  Heirloom,  scented, delicate, interesting, all kinds of flowers, but most importantly - FRESH and LOCAL.     <font color=""#B23838"">But I need your help to turn my small cutting garden into something more.</font>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each year, we are importing more and more of our cut flowers in Canada, and, quite frankly, there is <b>NO</b> need for this.  In British Columbia there is <i>so much</i> variety in the flowers we can grow locally – the possibilities for shape, colour, form, texture, and perfume are endless.  Endless!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439672910/ohmachxbtbuul79vg4s9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>I want to do something I love</b>, something that not only makes me happy, but others as well.  Growing flowers is it.  <font color=""#CC5252"">I want my flowers to be a celebration of the seasons</font>.  I want to do my part to spread the word about why local flowers matter, why they're better, and what it means to support your community.  I want to grow and sell flowers that are safe for everyone, including the critters that want to eat them.</p>
<br/><p><b>WHY FLOWERS?</b><br/>I like flowers.  I've always liked flowers.  Most people do – flowers make you smile. <br/></p>
<p>Last spring I had a beautiful baby boy.  He was perfect.  He also cried inconsolably – <i>a lot</i>.  Aside from being physically attached to me, the only thing that seemed to settle him down was being held in front of flowers.</p>
<p>That activated my love and appreciation for flowers.  I started reading about flowers, and I began to follow more and more florists on Instagram and Pinterest.  I learned that some of these florists were actually <i>farmer-florists</i>.  I was floored.  <i>You can grow flowers.. for a living?</i>  <br/></p>
<p>Reading more about these farmer-florists led me to the Slow Flower movement, and a heightened awareness of the importance of locally-grown flowers.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439704096/vmczkxkegmlbpkfldmou.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>People want, and are entitled, to know the origin of their flowers</b>.  Most flowers sold in Canada are imported from Latin America, from countries that do not have the same strict regulations regarding pesticide use.  Bunches of flowers are dipped in large tubs of pesticide to prevent importing pests.  Other flowers are sprayed regularly.  Workers are exposed to these pesticides – no one should have to wear a mask when harvesting flowers.  <font color=""#CC5252"">And if workers wear masks around the flowers, why are you sticking your face right in them?</font></p>
<p>Unless you're buying locally grown flowers, the odds are not great that there will be any fragrance at all.  Flowers imported from thousands of miles away, as most of our flowers are, don't have the luxury of having scent.  Fragrance is costly for a plant and shortens its life, especially out of water, and by the time these flowers get to you, they've been out of water for around two weeks.  That's what they're bred for - uniformity and a long lifespan so they can make it to consumers.</p>
<p>Also, flowers are a valuable crop that can be grown on small parcels of land that aren't necessarily ideal for food production, such as disused industrial lots. Cities are full of these little pockets of brown-space – why not put them to use, and make things more beautiful in the process?<br/></p>

What We Need, What You Get, & What's Next


The amount of funding I am asking for is the minimum needed to get started.  I need to expand my small cutting garden by about 450 square feet and it's going to be a lot of work.  Let's break it down, y'all:

  
Beds - This includes: materials ($40 x 11 beds), fill ($35/yd x 11-12 + delivery fee), and amendments (organic fertilizer, lime, bone meal $75) = $965


Irrigation - This is for an irrigation kit, extra tubing and connectors = $150


Tools & Supplies - I don't have any of my own! Wheelbarrow ($115.. the one you're seeing in the photos doesn't have a bottom), various tools ($80.. shovel, hoe, garden fork, trowel, snippers), soil blockers and bins ($70), wire and netting ($100), labels ($10) = $375


Transport & Market Needs - I don't drive and want to keep my environmental impact low.  I need a bike and trailer ($300) to get to the market as well as tables, a canopy, and a sign ($150). = $450


Flowers - I still have some seed from my cutting garden, but I need to purchase more in order to fill the beds with a wider range of blooms and keep them in flower all season long = $135


Miscellaneous - This includes things like materials for making potting mix ($35), building a propagation table and light rig ($75), flower food, card stock, and a smidge extra in case I've forgotten something (you know how it goes), = $180


Fees - This includes market vendor fees ($35), domain, business registration and name fees ($80), and IndieGoGo fees = $250













PERKS

My husband is an illustrator and has graciously agreed to help me out with perks! Wahoo! He will be doing some nice botanical illustrations as well as illustrations of beneficial insects.  These will then be available at different perk levels as sets of greeting cards or art prints.

I will be making pressed flower bookmarks and monograms, which would look lovely framed.

Patrick Souop, né à Bafoussam le 5 avril 1991, au coeur de la
région de l'Ouest au Cameroun, marquée par la culture Bamiléké.
Je suis issu d’une famille agricole d'un petit village avec des
petits revenus et des parents ayant peu fréquenté l’école. J’ai
passé avec succès le bac en sciences mathématiques, et j’ai
décidé de poursuivre mes études plutôt que de fonder une famille.

<p>Mon objectif est de
réaliser mon rêve de devenir pilote de ligne, un métier que j’ai
choisi du plus profond de mon cœur depuis que j’ai 5 ans. Si je ne
peux pas réaliser mon rêve, j’aimerais obtenir un diplôme
d’ingénieur ou un Master dans ce secteur.</p>
<p>Je me suis donc
inscrit en faculté de Sciences physiques à l’université de
Dschang. Je dois actuellement financer seul cette initiative :
logement, cours, nourriture… J’ai réussi à me débrouiller pour
passer les première et deuxième années. Si je devais résumer ma
situation avec un terme beaucoup plus utilisé en physique, ce donne
alors ceci : un étudiant isolé.</p>
<p>Sans détailler
toutes les galères par lesquelles je suis passé, je me suis alors
demandé : comment pourrais-je plus facilement financer mes
études ? J’ai vu que la photocopie des cours et des TD
faisaient dépenser beaucoup les étudiants. Avoir une photocopieuse permettrait alors de réduire ces frais et de gagner un peu
d’argent en rendant service aux autres étudiants de la fac, à
un prix leur permettant également de diminuer leurs frais de
photocopie.</p>
<p>J’ai discuté avec
des personnes qui avaient des photocopieuses : avec une machine
neuve et un lieu de vente à proximité de la fac l’activité se
trouve très rentable. En la disposant dans ma chambre, qui ferme à clé, pas besoin de
louer un local, je n’aurai que l’encre à payer, et je serai bien
place… Mais une photocopieuse neuve vaut 600 000 FCFA ( 916€),
sans compter le transport depuis le port de Douala (40 000 FCFA) !
Arrivant à peine à payer ma nourriture, je devais penser à autre
chose de concret plutôt que de rester dans l’abstraction. J’ai
alors pensé à un ami français, Maxime Plat, que j’ai connu en
stage dans mon village (il logeait chez ma mère) et qui m’a
toujours soutenu dans ma démarche. Il m’a conseillé de me tourner
vers le financement participatif ! Même si je ne parviens pas à
tout financer par cette voie, les fonds récoltés me permettront
d’accéder à un micro-crédit, actuellement inaccessible faute
d'apport personnel ou de garanties suffisantes aux yeux des caisses
de micro-crédit que j'ai rencontré.</p>
<p>Si je rêve de
voyages et de découverte, j'aime ma culture Bamiléké et j'aime la
faire partager. C'est une culture riche et qui a réussi à rester
vivante et évoluer jusqu'à aujourd'hui. Je vous la ferai partager

<br/></div>","Je m’appelle
Patrick Souop, né à Bafoussam le 5 avril 1991, au coeur de la
région de l'Ouest au Cameroun, marquée par la culture Bamiléké.
Je suis issu d’une famille agricole d'un petit village avec des
petits revenus et des parents ayant peu fréquenté l’école. J’ai
passé avec succès le bac en sciences mathématiques, et j’ai
décidé de poursuivre mes études plutôt que de fonder une famille.

Mon objectif est de
réaliser mon rêve de devenir pilote de ligne, un métier que j’ai
choisi du plus profond de mon cœur depuis que j’ai 5 ans. Si je ne
peux pas réaliser mon rêve, j’aimerais obtenir un diplôme
d’ingénieur ou un Master dans ce secteur.
Je me suis donc
inscrit en faculté de Sciences physiques à l’université de
Dschang. Je dois actuellement financer seul cette initiative :
logement, cours, nourriture… J’ai réussi à me débrouiller pour
passer les première et deuxième années. Si je devais résumer ma
situation avec un terme beaucoup plus utilisé en physique, ce donne
alors ceci : un étudiant isolé.
Sans détailler
toutes les galères par lesquelles je suis passé, je me suis alors
demandé : comment pourrais-je plus facilement financer mes
études ? J’ai vu que la photocopie des cours et des TD
faisaient dépenser beaucoup les étudiants. Avoir une photocopieuse permettrait alors de réduire ces frais et de gagner un peu
d’argent en rendant service aux autres étudiants de la fac, à
un prix leur permettant également de diminuer leurs frais de
photocopie.
J’ai discuté avec
des personnes qui avaient des photocopieuses : avec une machine
neuve et un lieu de vente à proximité de la fac l’activité se
trouve très rentable. En la disposant dans ma chambre, qui ferme à clé, pas besoin de
louer un local, je n’aurai que l’encre à payer, et je serai bien
place… Mais une photocopieuse neuve vaut 600 000 FCFA ( 916€),
sans compter le transport depuis le port de Douala (40 000 FCFA) !
Arrivant à peine à payer ma nourriture, je devais penser à autre
chose de concret plutôt que de rester dans l’abstraction. J’ai
alors pensé à un ami français, Maxime Plat, que j’ai connu en
stage dans mon village (il logeait chez ma mère) et qui m’a
toujours soutenu dans ma démarche. Il m’a conseillé de me tourner
vers le financement participatif ! Même si je ne parviens pas à
tout financer par cette voie, les fonds récoltés me permettront
d’accéder à un micro-crédit, actuellement inaccessible faute
d'apport personnel ou de garanties suffisantes aux yeux des caisses
de micro-crédit que j'ai rencontré.
Si je rêve de
voyages et de découverte, j'aime ma culture Bamiléké et j'aime la
faire partager. C'est une culture riche et qui a réussi à rester
vivante et évoluer jusqu'à aujourd'hui. Je vous la ferai partager
avec grand plaisir au travers des contreparties de vos dons si
précieux, malgré les difficultés d'acheminement jusqu'à chez
vous : chapeaux, bijoux, masques, instruments de musique, sacs artisanaux, habits et objets de cérémonies bamilékés. Pour les plus généreux et curieux d'entre vous, nous vous proposons même nos contacts et bonnes adresses pour venir découvrir cette région magnifique !
Si toutefois vous ne
pouvez pas contribuer mais que mon projet vous intéresse,  en parler
autour de vous et sur les réseaux sociaux sera une contribution
toute aussi précieuse !

	élevés par rapport à nos moyens)


Quelles sont les
forces du projet ?


Des personnes de ma famille
	peuvent me fournir les contacts adéquats pour acheter une
	photocopieuse fiable


Mon service sera vraiment
	attractif par rapport aux autres pour les étudiants

	dégradation de la photocopieuse : il sera fortement atténué
	car elle sera dans ma chambre, que je peux verrouiller, lorsque je
	n'y serais pas pour offrir mes services
