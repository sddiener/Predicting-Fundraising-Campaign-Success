<h3>Agavi:  Digital Science and Technology Education Everywhere</h3>
<p><strong>Education technology.</strong>  For too many teachers it's expensive, uninspired, or takes too long to learn.  Not only that, it often requires reliable high speed internet and cutting-edge devices to run ... <strong>leaving rural, impoverished, and disabled teachers and students behind.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611886247/tc2shfbalyauy9lhe0b0.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are a team of teachers and technologists and we are working to change that.  Lev has 20 years of science teaching experience through various in-person, hybrid, flipped, and online classroom settings across the US and globally.  Bianca, Alex, and Wayne are enthusiastic programmers eager to improve technologies used in classrooms around the world, especially those in overlooked communities.  Manuela is a user experience designer keen to develop simple and intuitive interfaces so that anyone can easily pick up and use educational technology.  We are scattered all over the world, but united in the quest to change digital education for the better.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Enter Agavi</strong>.</p>
<p>Agavi is an adaptive learning platform designed by 21st century teachers for 21st century teachers and students.  With just a few taps on your smartphone, you'll be able to create <i>tasks</i> you can deploy to your students.  What's a task?  You can obviously show some text or videos and ask questions, but any system can do this 20th-century-style passive learning.  What if you could <strong>move beyond the screen</strong> and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geotag tasks and activities to unique sites to guide students in the field or even around their immediate surroundings?</li>
<li>Connect to internal smartphone sensors to access physical data (like angle of tilt or compass directions) that can immediately be used in classroom activities?</li>
<li>Connect to external sensors to train students in lab and fieldwork skills?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, imagine sequencing all your diverse tasks into an <i>experience </i>and deploying it to your students even without a reliable internet connection.  You'll be able to <strong>build choose-your-own adventure activities </strong>where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create branching and alternative pathways for your students to follow</li>
<li>Integrate team and individual tasks into the same experience</li>
<li>Assign different teams to different interlinked tasks all within the same experience</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>When your experience is live, you'll be able to <strong>track your students through <i>actionable analytics</i> </strong>that will show you what your students are doing and what they need help with right when they are working.  In your teacher interface, you'll get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A live view of where all your students are in the experience</li>
<li>Ability to quickly identify problem points</li>
<li>Quick and easy access to what a student has already done to help you diagnose problems and propose solutions quickly and easily</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Whether you have a strong internet connection or not, you'll be able to use Agavi, as we are designing it to have a <strong>low power and bandwidth footprint</strong> and even be deployable on a local network, such as a Raspberry Pi communicating with a few local devices.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>That's only the first step.</strong></p>
<p>As the platform grows, together we will be <i>building a global community</i> that lets teachers share and improve each others' activities.  We'll be incorporating <i>AI to help teachers adapt content</i> on the network to their local environment and its specific challenges, as well as building a <i>research platform</i> to investigate not just how students learn but also how teachers build, modify, adapt, and share content (currently extremely difficult to study!).  Plus, Agavi will have an<i> API so that you can build your own instrumentation that connects to and communicates with the system</i>, expanding it beyond even what we can imagine!</p>
<p>Sounds pretty 21st century for a learning system, right?  But we can't build this alone.  We need your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $50,000 to get started.  All of us are volunteers and work on this system in our spare time, which can sometimes make progress painfully slow.  But with a bit of starting capital, we can pay for initial server and database costs as well as people's time so that we can build this platform faster.</p>
<p>And you can be along for the ride!  Become an early tester or even help guide the development of the platform.  We can't anticipate every community's teaching needs, but if you talk, we'll listen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lev has worked with teachers in Ukraine and eastern Indonesia and has seen firsthand how lack of infrastructure or affordable options hamper good teaching.  He wants to change that.  Bianca, Alex, Wayne, and Manuela jumped on board because they believe there can and should be a better option for teachers everywhere.</p>
<p>With Agavi, we aim not just to make creating adaptive and creative digital lessons easier, but also more accessible to vulnerable and underserved populations around the world.  This isn't just another flashy edtech.  It's edtech on a mission to serve those who have been ignored by the edtech sector.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any technology, the biggest risk is in scope creep and budgets exploding due to unforeseen technical challenges.  To mitigate against this, we will deploy the simplest system we can into paying customers' hands as early as possible so that we can quickly establish an income stream that can help fund continued development and expansion of the system.  Additionally, we have a ""rainy day"" fund through Science Voices, our nonprofit, that can help cushion some unexpected expenses.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help financially now, that's OK!  Get the word out to your friends or share with teachers who are looking for simpler, more powerful edtech tools for science and technology teaching.  Additionally you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join the team and help with design and programming</li>
<li>Help test the system</li>
<li>Talk to us about what your teaching challenges are and what features could help you</li>

<p><strong>CAMs technology</strong></p>
<p>The observatory will be a part of the SETI Institute’s CAMS project, a global network of citizen-run CCTV cameras that captures data on meteor showers and meteorites. Typical observatories observe light to make findings, but CAMS records particles interacting with the Earth’s atmosphere. This is a unique and efficient way to study the streams of meteoroids in the path of comets and asteroids. To do this, CAMS uses low-light CCTV cameras at stations across the globe—548 in total. Currently, there are CAMS sites in the USA, Europe, United Arab Emirates, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Brazil, and Namibia.</p>

<h3>Research Support Summary</h3>
<p>I am Kelee Siat, a second year part time PhD student at the University of Manchester, UK. I have always been academically focused and found that employment and passion are not always mutually affectionate, but aspiration and determination are. After many upheavals, I altered my career pathway in 2011 waitressing to supplement my income and pay for tuition. In 2019 I had the opportunity to apply and be accepted for a research PhD in Egyptology. 6 months into my research the pandemic hit, though I am fortunate to have a part time job from home, I am beginning to see possible restrictions to my research studies at home.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help lift some of these research restrictions by being able to purchase books containing texts and translations that cannot be accessed from university locations due to lending restrictions and the ongoing pandemic. I am looking for funds to aid in my tuition payment for my current academic year 2 and for contribution towards books and archive material for my continuing research.  </p>
<p>What you as a contributor will be able to help me achieve is a unique opportunity to advance research in the realm of understanding the presence of women in ancient diplomatic correspondence, a topic that has not been significantly addressed in the field of Egyptology. You will be contributing to the research of our collective ancient past. </p>
<p><font><span>The contribution that you are choosing to make will contribute to our understanding and analysis of the records of the ancient past. Your support will bring me closer to the completion of my PhD and provide the resources to continue into my next academic year of study. </span></font></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is needed &amp; what you get for your contribution</h3>
<p>I am currently hoping to raise a total of £1325 for research and resources. £750 will go towards my tuition fees for the current academic year. This will enable me to have secure funding available to complete my second year and permit my focus to be on my research without worry. £575 will be used towards the purchasing of rare or much needed books and materials.</p>
<p>Your contributions and what you will receive: </p>
<ul>
<li>£1 Coffee Tier - you receive a thank you for your token towards my research fund. </li>
<li>£5 Coffee &amp; Research Tier - Your support on this tier will provide coffee fuel motivation to move forward with my research and you will receive a newsletter email update of my progress for the end of my academic year 2021 acknowledging what you have helped me accomplish through your support.</li>
<li>£10 Scribal Stationary Tier - you will receive a set of Scribal Stationary, 10 sheets of A5 paper, hand tea dyed.</li>
<li>£50 Scribal Appreciation Tier - As a campaign backer, you will receive a printed newsletter update about my progress in the summer and receive 20 sheets of my hand tea dyed scribal stationary paper. </li>
<li>£100 Scribal Research Appreciation Tier - you will receive a set of 20 sheets of my hand tea dyed scribal stationary paper, a printed newsletter of my progress and a personally transcribed passage from an ancient Egyptian text in penned hieroglyphs on my tea dyed paper.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution makes a historic difference by contributing.</p>
<ul>
<li>My research is unique to the field of Egyptology at PhD level.</li>
<li>You are enabling research into ancient texts and ancient individuals in a time that forged unique diplomatic relations and also a time right before a confusing collapse of many societies. </li>
<li>Your contribution at every level is a token of generosity and will add to my focus and determination to complete my PhD and give back in return through my teaching aspirations. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Research Challenges</h3>
<p>Hurdles are inevitable, and there might be moments where those elusive books are available one minute and gone the next. I might need to wait a bit longer and this could impact my research. My tuition is completely self-funded at the moment and this might have unforeseen challenges in the years to come in fully completing my PhD. However, I have been persistent not to give up and your contributions will make a huge difference in the immediacy of any of these challenges. I am certain that the research foundation I am building now and in the immediate future will be a strong footing for my future in Egyptology. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Just because you can’t contribute monetarily doesn’t mean that your well wishes would not go unrecognised! Thank you for taking the time to just read my story and what I hope I can achieve. You can also share my campaign and there are share tools available on Indiegogo with this campaign and others. </p>

                                                                    Cover updated 2/10/21
 
The beach…an amusement park…delicious desserts. From early in the morning till late at night, this brother and sister's epic day is described with Python computer programs!
 
 
 
Back cover:  This picture book tells the story of a day packed with fun activities like eating cookies and playing miniature golf. But this is no ordinary story- it's written in the Python programming language. Don't know Python? This will help you learn it. Also, there's English translations!
 The story is told with “code pages” next to full-page illustrations. Each code page contains a complete Python program that introduces a new Python concept. The full-page illustration next to each code page shows the situation being described in code. Code page: Illustration page:                   You can run each program on your computer! Python is free to download and install. You can also use a free online Python compiler.                               Every program prints output to the screen with a print function. Modify values and have fun playing with the code! Important note: Pizza WILL be in this story.  Sneak peek:  ...and cake!    Everyone! Younger children can enjoy this book as a fun picture book with the benefit of being exposed to logical thinking and code. Older kids and adults can gain a more in-depth understanding of programming concepts and Python by reading the programs and code explanations (and enjoying the pictures!).The Python programs that make up the story also serve as useful code examples to look back on to refresh your memory of concepts and syntax.  Give the gift of learning to codeProgramming is a valuable skill you can apply to create useful applications and products. There are infinite possibilities! It also strengthens other skills including logical thinking, creativity, decision making, planning, problem solving, and focus. Python is a high-level (human-readable) programming language that is known for being easy to learn. The Python Standard Library has a large collection of built-in functions and modules that can be used in your code to make it easier to perform tasks.  A Day in Code: Python will cover the basics of Python, including the following topics:
Syntax
Keywords
Strings and data types
Operators
Input/Output
Conditional statements and loops
Lists, dictionaries, and tuples
Functions and methods
Classes and objects
Modules
 Where is Python used?For students and hobbyists, the Raspberry Pi (https://www.raspberrypi.org) board is a popular platform commonly programmed with Python. You can connect it to a display, keyboard, and mouse to use it as a desktop PC. You can also connect it to electronic components with input/output pins and use it for hardware and Internet of Things (IoT) projects. Here are some prominent applications that commonly use Python:
Data science and analysis
AI and Machine learning
Scientific and numeric computing
Computer vision
Web development and apps
Game development
   Funding will be used for the following:
Completing the illustrations with a hired artist
Layout and formatting
Printed proofs and setup costs
Hardcover book production

</h3>
<p>EDUCATION + DANCE + COMMUNITY SERVICE = LOVE</p>
<p>5 years ago I went to Uganda for the first time to volunteer, teaching Senior 2 English at a secondary school deep in the village. <b>Out of my class of about 55 students, only<i> </i>2 girls remain in school today</b>,<b> </b>one of which is our sponsee, Recheal.  Without sponsorship, EVERY
 OTHER GIRL from my class has since dropped out of school, and nearly ALL of them have given birth to one or two 
children.  Today, these bright young women are stuck at home in their villages- jobless, living in 
poverty, now with their own children suffering.  5 years ago, I came to Uganda just hoping to give Love and be of service to others.  I had no idea then that Uganda would become my life, and the people, my family.  I have been back to Uganda 5 times and with the help of Lara Martin and Lindsey Hedrick, co-founded a 501c3 nonprofit, called Project: More Love.  We have come SO far, and yet this is just the beginning. Our biggest goal this year is to raise enough money for Recheal to go University, but we are not stopping there!    <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>
</h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support is a crucial part of a
<i> </i>collective effort to <b>let young women in Uganda know they are not 
forgotten, they are valuable, they are worth educating, and they can 
make a difference in their communities.</b>  There is hope!  Project: More 
Love is a grassroots, locally supported charity, that sponsors upper level education for 
girls.  Our work is vital because no other organization in the district is focusing on this issue.  University education is expensive and many Ugandans feel that girls are not worth 
educating, but <i>we disagree</i>.  We are rising to the challenge.  <br/></p>
<p> In Uganda, many people die from
preventable diseases because they don't have access to clean water, proper health care or nutrition.  <strong>The unemployment rate in Uganda is the highest in all of Africa</strong>, and more than 38% of the population is living below the international poverty rate of $1.25 USD per day.  On a more personal level, at a workshop for young women in our village, most of them admitted to being forced to resort to prostitution for something as trivial as a bar of soap.  As a teacher, friend, and human being - I cannot even express the sadness and outrage I felt hearing these beautiful girls speak out. The challenges we are facing are vast and overwhelming.  <br/></p>
<p><b>BUT</b>, instead of just focusing on a mountain of problems- at Project: More Love we choose to focus on<i> <b>Love</b></i>.  Individuals who are suffering are not problems to be solved, but people to be Loved.  We believe that investing in one young woman, is investing in an entire community.<br/></p>
<p>Year after year, our sponsee, Recheal 
has proven to be <em>exceptional</em>.  
She is as talented as she is bright, and her giving heart and creative spirit are truly one of a kind.  With a University degree, she has the chance to break out of a cycle of poverty and become self-supporting.  She can become a positive mentor &amp; role model for the young 
girls and boys growing up in her village.  She has the chance to inspire
 change not only her own life, but in the lives of all who know her.  We 
are so proud of her and we Love her dearly!  For the past two years, we have been successful in raising school fees for Recheal, but now we are facing our biggest and most expensive challenge yet- University.  Please help 
Recheal continue studying.  Together, one small step at a time, we can 
do it!</p>
<b></b><h3><b>What We Need &amp; Where Donations Will Go</b></h3>
<ul> <li>Our first priority is Recheal's University education &amp; we need to raise $12000.  **This includes housing, meals, transportation, books, and a lap top, all of which she needs in order to be a successful University student.** <br/>
</li>
<li>The second part of our budget is for opening an office on the ground in Uganda. As we continue to grow, we absolutely need a headquarters with a PO Box, phone, internet, and meeting space for our Uganda staff and students.  This will cost approximately $3500 for 1 year.<br/>
</li>
<li>Third, and this is where transparency comes in - we need help getting out of ""the red"".  We are small, grassroots nonprofit and to date, all of our staff have been working for free and investing their own time &amp; money into making this project work.  Going forward, we have sustainable fundraising strategies in place, but we are calling on our supporters to help us get jump-started in 2015.  We need $3500 to break even, and have budgeted $6000 total salary for all of our staff in Uganda for 1 year.</li>
<li>Any extra funds will go directly towards the sponsorship of more students! Each student in our program gets the highest level of mentorship, job training, and support.  We believe in the value of quality over quantity.  <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the breakdown of how we plan to allocate our funds:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>$12000 - Recheal's University education</li>
<li>$3500 - Ugandan office/headquarters</li>
<li>$3500 - Start Up Costs<br/>
</li>
<li>$6000 - Salary for entire staff in Uganda for 1 year<br/>
</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people can't contribute money, but there are other <b>BIG </b>ways to help:</p> <ul> <li>Spread the Love and tell friends, family &amp; coworkers about our campaign!</li> <li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!  They're easy.<br/>
</li>
<li>Volunteer at PML events or attend our monthly yoga classes.</li>
<li>Call someone and tell them you Love them, dance, laugh, forgive.<br/>

Third, and this is where transparency comes in - we need help getting out of ""the red"".  We are small, grassroots nonprofit and to date, all of our staff have been working for free and investing their own time & money into making this project work.  Going forward, we have sustainable fundraising strategies in place, but we are calling on our supporters to help us get jump-started in 2015.  We need $3500 to break even, and have budgeted $6000 total salary for all of our staff in Uganda for 1 year.
Any extra funds will go directly towards the sponsorship of more students! Each student in our program gets the highest level of mentorship, job training, and support.  We believe in the value of quality over quantity.  


Here's the breakdown of how we plan to allocate our funds:

$12000 - Recheal's University education
$3500 - Ugandan office/headquarters
$3500 - Start Up Costs

$6000 - Salary for entire staff in Uganda for 1 year

   Other Ways You Can Help Some people can't contribute money, but there are other BIG ways to help:  Spread the Love and tell friends, family & coworkers about our campaign! Use the Indiegogo share tools!  They're easy.

Volunteer at PML events or attend our monthly yoga classes.

<p>Hello, my name is Genny, I was born in the highlands of
Ecuador 41 years ago. I was fortunate enough that my parents
supported me in working hard at school, which eventually lead me to
obtain a scholarship for college education in Europe. There, I
experienced first hand what it is to have so many doors open thanks
to a good education, but above all thanks to the awareness that
everyone has the right and the capacity to pursue their own dreams.</p>
<p>El Manantial educational center was built starting
March 2014, by 12 families, 15 children, 3 guides and many friends. So
far all has been funded with the effort, time, and money brought in
by the families. Now, it is time to open the project to others!</p>
<p><b>The driving idea of our project, is to provide
our children and the local community with an education alternative
based on respect, creativity, freedom and an overall healthy and
supportive evironment for their unlimited development - for boys AND
girls.</b></p>
<p>We use active education methods and materials
(Montessori, alternative) and prepared environments to open as many
possibilities in the minds and spirits of the children.  We also
support practical learning with activities and experiences involving
nature and the day to day of the local community. 
</p>
<p><b>Mindo is afterall a birdwatching paradise and
mega-diverse natural spot, but it is also a village where half of the
population lives under the poverty threshold, alcoolism and domestic
violence and abuse are rampant, and lots remains to be done in terms
of infrastructure, health and above all, education.</b></p>
<h3><b>Your support</b></h3>
<p>will help us to promote within the community the
concepts of:</p><ul>
<li>quality education (as opposed to learning by heart and complying to rules)</li>
<li>equality for little girls (often relegated to household chores, and discouraged from pursuing their development)</li>
<li>respect and collaboration</li>
<li>individual initiative and responsibility</li>
<li>environmental awareness</li>
<li>integral health awareness (mind, body, nutrition, women's health)<br/>
</li>
</ul><h3><b>What do we need?</b></h3>
<p>Needs are neverending of course :) <br/>but these
are our priorities for the school year starting April 2015:</p><ul>
<li>
5 full scholarships for local children with no resources 9.000$</li>
<li>Maintenance and building 1.200$ (build an additional room for the 8-10 year olds, repair the thatch roof of the communal space for the little ones)</li>
<li>Making and purchasing of learning materials 800$</li>
<li>Organize events and workshops to promote integral education within the local community 4.000$. 
</li>
</ul><p>Children are a crucial door to families and
especially to mothers here in Ecuador. Babies and toddlers are
cherished, but soon the demands of large families and few resources
pile up the responsibilities and hard work on very young kids. <br/><br/>We
want to build a trusting relationship with the town mothers, so that
they find a space with us to talk about their problems: parenting,
family life, health, self-worth.<br/>In our culture, mothers are the
main influence who promote self-esteem and open the world to their
children... or not.<b><br/><br/>We believe we can create this safe and
supportive space from within, starting with the children, by way of
integrating them to our Center and to our community events.</b></p><p>Please donate! Even 10$ can make a difference for the future of a little one!<br/></p><p>If

<p>Of course the money we are hoping for covers everything we need... but any help is appreciated.  We will eventually make this happen with no help, but we would love to open up for this year's students. Our goal is to go green energy and do this right the FIRST time!  If we only go part of the way now, it will cost 3X as much to put it together a little at a time.  Any money below the dream amount will go to just the basics of opening up the campus. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The Life Training Campus and our Muskegon location is just Phase One.  As this facility begins to run smoothly, we start another... and then another.  The world needs leadership almost as much as it needs air right now.  Join us in this battle.  Bishop Tom Omukhobero from Kenya flew in from Nairobi just to meet us in person after he had seen some of the material we will be using at the campus.  This is exactly what he wanted for his church leaders and the orphans.  He used the last of his bank account for the flight and we made sure his trip would be worth it.  Bishop Tom didn't want a handout for his people, he wanted leadership training so he could end the cycle of poverty in Kenya.  We began ""One Tribe"" and things are rolling in Africa, let's get America going.  Leaders are needed everywhere from the presidency to your family.  Let's have fun and do it together.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks are few, the challenges many... Getting the building up to code again is going to take some money.  Mr. Joseph LaMie and his construction background, along with his business contacts, make this all possible.  We love our local community and know you love yours as well.  Let's start locally and build from there.  When we finish this project, let us know which community you think we should help next.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you don't have any money to donate at this time, visit our website and contribute later.  Or, tell everyone you can using the Indiegogo website.  Help us build leaders out of our students at any age.  </p>

Please check our perks for anyone who contributes to the fundraiser.  We want you to be involved with us forever!  Not just one donation and done.  Donate and you are part of the family.  Get involved and you will find out that this will be the thing that starts the Dominoes of Destiny!  You get a fantastic gift for helping save the world AND you can visit us at any of our campuses worldwide with your entire family!  We would love to have you.
Of course the money we are hoping for covers everything we need... but any help is appreciated.  We will eventually make this happen with no help, but we would love to open up for this year's students. Our goal is to go green energy and do this right the FIRST time!  If we only go part of the way now, it will cost 3X as much to put it together a little at a time.  Any money below the dream amount will go to just the basics of opening up the campus.    The Impact The Life Training Campus and our Muskegon location is just Phase One.  As this facility begins to run smoothly, we start another... and then another.  The world needs leadership almost as much as it needs air right now.  Join us in this battle.  Bishop Tom Omukhobero from Kenya flew in from Nairobi just to meet us in person after he had seen some of the material we will be using at the campus.  This is exactly what he wanted for his church leaders and the orphans.  He used the last of his bank account for the flight and we made sure his trip would be worth it.  Bishop Tom didn't want a handout for his people, he wanted leadership training so he could end the cycle of poverty in Kenya.  We began ""One Tribe"" and things are rolling in Africa, let's get America going.  Leaders are needed everywhere from the presidency to your family.  Let's have fun and do it together.     Risks & Challenges The risks are few, the challenges many... Getting the building up to code again is going to take some money.  Mr. Joseph LaMie and his construction background, along with his business contacts, make this all possible.  We love our local community and know you love yours as well.  Let's start locally and build from there.  When we finish this project, let us know which community you think we should help next.     Other Ways You Can Help If you don't have any money to donate at this time, visit our website and contribute later.  Or, tell everyone you can using the Indiegogo website.  Help us build leaders out of our students at any age.

<p>Hi, my name is Lydia Fong. I work at TOUCH Community Services, a non-profit organisation in Singapore. My passion is working with children and teenagers and my role at TOUCH is to develop them to be community leaders of tomorrow. I strongly believe that teaching lessons close to my heart will touch hearts and transform the lives of young people. Instilling positive values in young people are critical for them to grow in character, confidence and competence. Positive values are building blocks in their lives; they ensure that they are on the right path to true success in life.</p>
<p>I’d like to share with you one of our programmes which helps needy children in a meaningful and innovative way. It’s called <b>TOUCH-PREP</b> (“<b>P</b>rimary 1 <b>Re</b>adiness <b>P</b>rogramme”).</p>

<p>Through TOUCH-PREP, we aim to give 5-6 year olds from less privileged backgrounds the opportunity to learn basic reading skills before they enter Primary 1 (or equivalent to first grade in elementary school). This is done over 5 weeks (2.5 hours per session) in a fun and interactive way, conducted by student leaders in the participating school. The 5-6 year olds will also learn social skills as he or she interacts with other students, and builds self-confidence.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Quiet and withdrawn, six-year-old Rahiezwan was a tough nut to crack for his 10-year-old mentors, Nicole Lau and Chan Cheuk Mun. But the two prefects from Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School (Primary) - tasked with introducing the boy to phonics to prepare him for Primary 1 next year – persevered. Rahiezwan can now read and spell simple words such as “cat”, using phonics skills he picked up from his two “teachers”.</i></b></p>
<p>[Source: The Straits Times © Singapore Press Holdings Limited. Permission required for reproduction.]</p>
<p>TOUCH-PREP is also
a unique leadership development programme to nurture student leaders as they
learn decision making, time management, empathy and social skills, as well as
creative ways in engaging and motivating young children. To prepare them for
their role, a special training session is conducted by TOUCH where they learn
about the various socio-economic backgrounds of families in Singapore and the
needs of disadvantaged families. They are also taught how to use the multimedia
educational activity kits consisting of CD-ROMs and activity books. The student
leaders will teach the children in a computer lab at the participating school.</p>
<p><b><i>A principal of a TOUCH-PREP participating school said she believed this programme gave her pupils “a head start to real-life situations”, and “They must realise that children come from different backgrounds, and may not be exposed to books and computers."" </i></b></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Why TOUCH-PREP?</b></h3>
<p>TOUCH believes that every child deserves a good start in life. Disadvantaged children would need more help with this start in life. The first year of school can be stressful and discouraging for kids from less fortunate backgrounds.</p>
<p>Hence, TOUCH-PREP has a two-pronged approach; it is a community service project that offers early learning opportunities for needy children; at the same time, it is a leadership development project that gives aspiring student leaders a platform to develop their capacity for leadership roles.</p>

<h3><b>Our Story</b></h3>
<p>Touched by the obvious need of low-income and single-parent families
with difficulties making ends meet, much less raising their children in a
positive environment, a group of volunteers in their 20s organised activities
to help the children. This small attempt since 1986 has today become TOUCH
Community Services. Over the last 23 years, our passion and mission at TOUCH is to strengthen families.</p>
<p>We are an award-winning charity registered in Singapore with an Institution of a Public
Character (IPC) status. We are also a member of the National Council of Social
Service.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We reach out to some 29,000 clients and 155,000 service users in a year. They include at-risk children and youths, needy families, people with intellectual or hearing disabilities, those with healthcare needs, as well as the frail elderly.</p>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>TOUCH-PREP
is recognised by schools as a worthy and beneficial project for both the needy
children as well as their student leaders. Over the last 4 years, TOUCH-PREP
was run 13 times in 4 participating schools, through which 195 needy children
benefited from the coaching by 293 student leaders. </p>
<p>This was
made possible through funding support from a corporation, for which
we are truly grateful! <b>However, this
funding has already run out.</b><b> Without funding, we are unable to bring TOUCH-PREP to any children from low-income families and in schools this year. </b>We now need fresh funding to take this project to some 60
beneficiaries and 120 student leaders this year. We would like to give the Indiegogo
community an opportunity to help our children!</p>
<p></p>
<p>While we value funding from corporations, we hope to partner them in other projects where we can also engage their employees’ time and expertise. We find that corporations generally prefer not to simply give money to programmes without more employee involvement as part of the partnership.<br/></p>
<p>If our campaign doesn’t receive sufficient funding, we may pitch to local government-linked agencies for funding. We hope
not to go that route as time taken to pitch to these agencies can be
long-drawn and uncertain; and funding, if finally approved, covers only part of
the project cost.</p>
<p>We really hope to utilise limited staff
time and resources in engaging beneficiaries and partners for our various works
and in developing innovative ideas to meet more needs in the community. <span>Any funds that come in after the
goal is met will be channelled to our work supporting needy children and families.</span></p>

Hi, my name is Lydia Fong. I work at TOUCH Community Services, a non-profit organisation in Singapore. My passion is working with children and teenagers and my role at TOUCH is to develop them to be community leaders of tomorrow. I strongly believe that teaching lessons close to my heart will touch hearts and transform the lives of young people.

Through TOUCH-PREP, we aim to give 5-6 year olds from less privileged backgrounds the opportunity to learn basic reading skills before they enter Primary 1 (or equivalent to first grade in elementary school).

What we
need & what you get

With your support, we are looking to run TOUCH-PREP trainings at 3 schools:

3 schools x 5 sessions = 15 sessions


60 needy kids aged 5-6 years old (estimated 20 beneficiaries per school)


120 student leaders aged 10-12 years old (estimated 40 student leaders per school)

Our funding wish list is broken down as follows:


Book & Stationary vouchers for needy kids


Supplies for TOUCH-PREP programme 


Training conducted by TOUCH Community Services


Transport (2-way) for needy kids from their neighbourhood to the school


Graduation party (Includes: Prizes, Food & Certificates for kids and student leaders)


Light refreshments for kids and students each session


Volunteer allowance which covers transport


Fees by Indiegogo/PayPal


Total S$13,365 (or USD 9,725)
Our work in TOUCH Community Services is sustained through donations and fund-raising efforts. We strive to use less than 20% of funds to cover fund-raising and administrative costs, and have been successful each year. With Indiegogo supporters like you, we hope to reduce this percentage much further!
We are able to issue tax-deduction receipts of 300% for those residing in Singapore (minimum contribution of S$50). For eg., for every S$100 donated, S$300 will be deducted from taxable income in Singapore for the year. Please provide your IC/FIN number and home address for us to process your tax deduction receipt within 3 working days.
By contributing, you'll receive heartwarming stories of the people we've helped and been inspired by, in our 88-page book ""Listen to My Heart - Rediscovering Life's Overcoming Spirit"" published by Write Editions.
""Listen to My Heart celebrates life's overcoming spirit. It tells the compelling life stories of a brave group of individuals, subtly woven into a tapestry of extraordinary inspiration. Despite being plagued by unfathomable adversity, these individuals are able to harness the quiet strength within them, rise up each time they fall, and persevere for a better tomorrow.""
The coffee-table book is an inspiring read, and a wonderful gift for friends and loved ones!
Here's how the book cover (26cm by 26cm) and inside pages look like:








Our Story
Touched by the obvious need of low-income and single-parent families
with difficulties making ends meet, much less raising their children in a
positive environment, a group of volunteers in their 20s organised activities
to help the children. This small attempt since 1986 has today become TOUCH
Community Services. Over the last 23 years, our passion and mission at TOUCH is to strengthen families.
We are an award-winning charity registered in Singapore with an Institution of a Public
Character (IPC) status. We are also a member of the National Council of Social
Service.

We reach out to some 29,000 clients and 155,000 service users in a year. They include at-risk children and youths, needy families, people with intellectual or hearing disabilities, those with healthcare needs, as well as the frail elderly.

Risks & Challenges  
TOUCH-PREP
is recognised by schools as a worthy and beneficial project for both the needy
children as well as their student leaders. Over the last 4 years, TOUCH-PREP
was run 13 times in 4 participating schools, through which 195 needy children
benefited from the coaching by 293 student leaders. 
This was
made possible through funding support from a corporation, for which
we are truly grateful! However, this
funding has already run out. Without funding, we are unable to bring TOUCH-PREP to any children from low-income families and in schools this year. We now need fresh funding to take this project to some 60
beneficiaries and 120 student leaders this year. We would like to give the Indiegogo
community an opportunity to help our children!

While we value funding from corporations, we hope to partner them in other projects where we can also engage their employees’ time and expertise. We find that corporations generally prefer not to simply give money to programmes without more employee involvement as part of the partnership.
If our campaign doesn’t receive sufficient funding, we may pitch to local government-linked agencies for funding. We hope
not to go that route as time taken to pitch to these agencies can be
long-drawn and uncertain; and funding, if finally approved, covers only part of
the project cost.
We really hope to utilise limited staff
time and resources in engaging beneficiaries and partners for our various works
and in developing innovative ideas to meet more needs in the community. Any funds that come in after the
goal is met will be channelled to our work supporting needy children and families.

Everything Helps!
If you aren’t able to help financially, we would truly
appreciate your help in passing this campaign on to people you know. Use the Indiegogo share tools on the top left corner of this page. Forward the link TOUCH PREP to your friends. Together, we can make a difference in children's lives!

</strong><p>Thank you Aden Suchak for the video!</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Why do we want to start a scholarship for refugee students?</b></p>
<p>  For
those who don’t know me, my name is Brian Huskie. I’m a teacher in an urban
district and as of this writing I’ve been there for eight years, five of which
I’ve taught English Language Learners. Before teaching I was in the Army, and in
2004 I was in Iraq. Here I am just over a decade ago: </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1265332/files/20150303111455-Husk_man.JPG?1425410095"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>  I was
with one other soldier at a traffic control point when two Iraqi kids came over
to talk to us. Here they are:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1265334/files/20150303111516-raywithchildren.jpg?1425410116"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>  They
wanted to go buy kabobs for us and charge us triple for them. They also wanted
our bullets so they could scrape the bullet off and light the gun powder. We
teased them for a few minutes, haggling over kabobs and lighting matches. The
older one tried to get us to give him a grenade for a couple kabobs. The
soldier who was with me, in the picture above, pretended to throw the grenade.
He didn’t even have it in his hand…it was in good fun…but the younger one ran
(stumbled, really) into the weeds and started crying. He was bawling. He
wouldn’t let anyone near him. I took off my helmet and gave up my gun and
brought the kid a Gatorade. He whirled around and hugged me, and we hugged in
the weeds for a long time. When I hug my four year old I sometimes feel that
little Iraqi boy’s ribs. Then he showed me the scars on his leg. He had been
burned from his ankle to his thigh. He was covered in scars. He made a machine
gun noise, pointed to his leg, and said “Amerikee!” That was eleven years ago.
If the kid is still alive, he’d be 18 or so.   </p>
<p>  Like a
bad movie, fireworks on the Fourth of July made my heart race something fierce,
at least the first few years after I came back. Then, with time, it faded, and
I moved on. Until last Fourth of July. I was with my family on Montauk beach watching
the fireworks and my youngest, 2 years old, was terrified. He tried to run away
high up on a sand dune so I ran after him, caught him, picked him up and tried
to console him. The kid just went limp. My son didn’t move, didn’t make a
sound, and just fell asleep, almost instantly. All of a sudden I was back,
kicking in doors and raiding homes. In one, there stood a man, he might have
been affiliated with Al Qaeda, who knows…but he had a son under the age of five
in the upstairs room. There was shooting and yelling, and the kid just slept. I
picked him up and brought him to his mother, and although he was unhurt he
wouldn’t wake up. He just went limp.</p>
<p>  There
is one nightmare I have. We took over a hospital and, after a day of fighting,
a man brought his son in. The son was obviously dead…maybe 7 or 8 years old. He
was flopping around in his dad’s arms. The father was laughing uncontrollably –
maniacally. I never forgot it.</p>
<p>  Refugees
are close to my heart. I have students now who are teenagers who were in Iraq
when I was there eleven years ago. When I see my students I see the crowds of
little kids who begged for pencils and candy; I see the kids who walked to
school until they canceled school so we could fight. I broke their desks to
burn to keep warm in December, and our sniper took a position in an elementary
classroom. I see the boy whose leg was burned, and the little limp sleeper who
had guns pointed at him, and the laughing dad. I see them in my own kids,
somehow. It haunts me.</p>
<p>  These
kids from Iraq, as well as refugees from other places in the Middle East,
Africa, Burma, and Nepal, didn’t choose to have war or persecution happen to
them. They didn’t choose the actions of their countries or of ours. They all
have their own stories, but somehow, they made it here. They have an obligation
to make the most out of their lives, and they know it. It’s a second chance
many don’t get. What are they going to do with this new life they were given? </p>
<p>We want this scholarship fund to
help refugees pay for college, and we are asking for your help. We need a
minimum of $25,000 for an endowment, which would give a small scholarship every
single year, forever. I would like to reach $100,000…that’s our goal. Any
little bit helps. Thank you for reading, and if you have any questions please
don’t hesitate to leave a comment. Thank you again! </p><p>
</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Scholarship Details</b></p>
<p>An endowment has been set up through SUNY Albany. If the goal
is reached, then a percentage of the principal will be given as a scholarship
to a capital district refugee student every year, forever. If the goal is not
reached, the money still goes as a single scholarship, but there will be no
endowment and the money will only be given once. This is a 501c3 project and so
there are tax benefits to donating!</p>

I lived and studied in Iraq until 2005. I went to Ebn Majid School in Baghdad. And like almost every other student, I tried very hard to get good grades and make my parents proud.</p><p>After the war in 2003 everything I knew changed. I rarely went to school; it was closed most of the times in the beginning. My school was next to three targeted places: a mosque for Sunni people, Husainia (where Shea people pray), and a police station. I still remember most of the explosions happened and I still remember how we prayed for the student’s and friends that we lost. One day that I will never forget was when they bombed the police station and the windows broke upon our heads. Everyone was running and screaming. It’s both funny and scary how everything you said you would do to protect your home becomes nothing when it comes to your life. However, I couldn’t run further than the school’s wall because I was looking my younger sister. I thought I lost her. I cried and asked for help but everyone was busy saving their lives because usually one explosion is not enough. My sister is way stronger than me. She came laughing and asking why I didn’t run home. I think she was taking it like a game. I took her hand and we ran home like everyone did.</p><p><a href=""http://www.theoutlawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Aya-Malak-2.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Aya Malak 2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.theoutlawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Aya-Malak-2-300x300.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p>They stopped closing the schools when people got use to the sound of explosions and many kids already knew how dead bodies look like. Sometimes, when something explodes in the morning, we just wait until noon to go to school and hear the principle’s speech. She always mentions how brave and strong we are and how the future of the country depends on us. I think it always worked because every kid likes to feel like a superhero. I left Iraq two years after. And never went back.</p><p>My dad took us to the United Arab Emirates. We found peace in there but as refugees we couldn’t have the rights that other people had. Many refugees couldn’t stay long because no one wanted us there. They made every day harder than the one before and it was also expensive to live there. I went to night school with my sister and my dad had to work three jobs to pay for it. Soon we found that there is no way we can live there.</p><p>So we moved to Jordan in 2009. And as almost everyone who lived there can say, it is expensive and there were no jobs. We had to live in a small place in the attic of some building. But at least we didn’t have to pay for our education. The schools there were dirty, so cold in winter, and as I remember most of the classes had 45 students in it. Sometimes you can’t breathe. Students, including me, lived what I like to call “psychological war”. They keep repeating that their life will end if they didn’t get an average above 90. And for some it did end. It’s hard when your future is decided by a single percentage point like it did for students in Jordan.</p><p>When I reached the 12th grade I had to drop high school. It wasn’t free anymore and my dad couldn’t afford it or the books. I think that’s the point when I started hating anyone who doesn’t respect a book because I’ve always felt that books should be in reach of every human’s hand. I still remember how much I cried and prayed to get a chance to finish high school. After all, I was raised with the idea that education is the only way to get a good, respectful life. My dad always used to say to me and my two sisters “If I can’t give you money and a life like princesses have, I will try my best to educate you to get it for yourselves, and that is my inheritance for you “. He did his best and still does.</p><p>When I struggled in both UAE and Jordan, I couldn’t always feel it because I calmed myself with saying I’ve seen worse. My Family and I were blessed and lucky because America accepted us. I will never forget the moment we arrived the JFK Airport. All the fire, pain and chaos in my heart stopped; finally we found a place that we can call a second home.</p><p>I want to study Aerospace Engineering. And I want to have the chance to make up all the bad years that my family been through. This is just a small sample of what refugees face in their lives. I want to say that life isn’t easy to all of us, but if you have a home, and a chance to educate yourself, then love it, appreciate it and try your best to protect it. Because somewhere on this planet there are many people who just want to reach their home in one piece, and many other people who need a little money, not to buy a pair of shoes, but to buy books. And believe it or not I’m certain that all of them wish to have the life that you have. Because I once did.</p><p><strong>Bhim</strong></p><p><a href=""http://www.theoutlawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bhim.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""bhim"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.theoutlawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bhim-169x300.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p>My name is Bhim. I was born in Bhutan, but my earliest memories are from a refugee camp in eastern Nepal. The Camp was a city made of plastic and tin huts built with ever present mud and bamboo stems. I spent 15 years of my life there. I have many memories there with my beautiful family and parents.</p><p>I also faced a lot of obstacles during my time in the refugee camp. We lived in a hut made of bamboo and sun dried molded bricks; the roof was made of plastic and bamboo sticks. Our bathroom was a hole on the ground right outside of the house. There was not much privacy. Other family members could easily see you bare parts. My house was not that strong either. The slightest wind or rain used to wreak havoc on our existence. It used to rain for months during the summer.</p><p>In the refugee camp, we had limited access to health care, and although what we had was free, there used to be a long line to see a doctor. Many people with fevers and other deadly diseases needed to wait for days before they could be seen by the doctor. He was a medically trained person, but we used to call him “doctor” because he was the only one we had seen around there prescribing medicine to patients.</p><p><a href=""http://www.theoutlawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bhim2.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""bhim2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.theoutlawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bhim2-225x300.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p>One day we learned that the United States was letting people in the camp apply for immigration to the United States. My parents were in doubt, initially, but once we heard about the better life in the USA, they jumped at the chance to move and applied for immigration. Moving to a new country with a new language, culture, and lifestyle was not easy. We knew very little and were a bit afraid. It made us very nervous and concerned. We knew we would be starting a life from scratch in another country.</p><p>We were driven from Bhutan for being of an ethnicity and religion that was different from that of the King, even though my family had lived in Bhutan for four generations and long before the collapse of the British Empire. After living in Nepal as a refugee, as a nationless being, we embarked on the journey to a destination with hope, but nothing else. We heard about terrible stories from people who had arrived in the U.S. before us. They were facing a very difficult life. My family still had nightmarish memories of dragging little kids out of Bhutan, leaving the land and life they had built. We thought we were repeating the same saga once again. Along with the decision to immigrate to the U.S., we also gave up any hope of returning to our land and house in Bhutan.</p><p>Even after I got to the U.S.A. I was scared. I do not know what I was scared of, but it took years before that fear went away. I knew no rules and regulations. I was struggling at school with all new subject matter, language, and style. At the same time, I was amazed when I saw so many different kinds of people. I quickly learned diversity was not unique to my home town, but true of every city in U.S. I became more comfortable with the language, culture, and rules. I started to make friends. Life suddenly felt much better; my parents and teachers played a critical role in making this happen. I am really thankful to them. I am extremely happy with what I have achieved, but I know that I have just started my journey.</p><p><strong>Malak</strong></p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.theoutlawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Malak.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Malak"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.theoutlawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Malak-248x300.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></strong></p><p>My name is Malak, I’m 18 years old student in Albany high, and I’m originally from Iraq. I left my country in 2006 and I didn’t go back, not even for a visit.</p><p>Me and people from my country have been through a lot since the war started. Life wasn’t easy at all. I still remember my friend, Rania, who went to shop for school supplies with her father when all of a sudden a bomb exploded next to them and turned them into pieces. That was a horrible thing to see and live with for anybody, especially to a 7 years old girl like me.</p><p><a href=""http://www.theoutlawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Malak-2.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Malak 2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.theoutlawacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Malak-2-300x225.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p>We were deprived of our basic rights, we spent long days and nights without stepping outside from my house because we were afraid of the explosions that were happening, and we also stopped going to school for months because of the battles that happened in Baghdad. There were two strategic places next to my school, a mosque and a police station, which were always bombed. And sometimes in the days that an explosion happens, we do go to school, but delayed for 2 hours.</p><p>So after all these events, we were forced to leave Baghdad and go to UAE. We faced many obstacles in the 5 years that we lived there. The high cost of visa, lodging, and school, we were simply unwelcomed as refugees to stay and live there, so we moved to Jordan only for one reason, to come to America. We lived there for 5 years, and because we were not citizens, we couldn’t work and if we did, we would go to jail or be sent back to Iraq, which was a certain fate of death.</p><p>We’ve been through a harsh circumstances, we couldn’t afford the expensive life there; luckily the schools were free, except for the 12th grade which we have to pay. We couldn’t afford that so we had to leave school for a year. Until the day we all waited for, the refugees organization (IOM) called us and said: your flight to Albany, New York will be in April 8, does this date works for you?  We couldn’t agree more, or be happier. It was the best moment of my life.<br/>So here I am, I’m here for almost a year, and I’m so grateful to be alive, to come to this great country, with my ambition to be a pharmacist one day. But I know that whatever happens, my family and I will be safe and have opportunities that we wouldn’t otherwise have, opportunities that are still just a beautiful dream to a lot of people, just like it was to us.</p><p>
</p><p><b>Saw</b></p>
<p>Hi! My name is Saw Pre Pre…ok! I was born in Burma, Mon
state (not Karen state). Because of the war my parents were worried if I was
born in Karen state that there would not be a nurse to help. Also, my mother
might not have had time to give birth because of running from Burmese soldiers.
I think you can already picture it in your head. Look…when I was young my life
wasn’t fulfilled and I didn’t get what I wanted – basically food, education,
clothes. If I were to compare American kids and refugee kids they are oil and
water. </p>
<p>I didn’t live in a refugee camp, but that doesn’t mean I’m
not a refugee…I’m a REFUGEE from BURMA!!! Who has run from the Burmese
military, who has attacked the Karen people. 
My school was like a living room, a tiny tiny living room. You know when
I lived there I saw many students in school buses with their beautiful uniforms,
but I had the unlucky curse of being a refugee, and they didn’t allow us to
attend a citizen’s school. Because of the education I’m so upset, I feel down,
all the time when my parents look at me their sympathy goes out to me. </p>
<p>At that time we are registered to come to America but my mom
is scared because of the new strange STRANGE STRANGE place. In the US, there
are different living styles, food, culture, etc…OK!!! Let me ask you, have you
ever thought of going to a strange place to live? How does that feel? Because
my mom was nervous! Finally, I can go to school without any sadness, because
here in Albany High School we can learn along with the citizens, and everyone
is equal in speech and freedoms. </p>
<p><b>Sara</b></p>
<p>My name is Sara Mohamed. I am 16 years old and I am Libyan
Sudanese. My parents are from Sudan and me and my siblings were born in Libya.
I have one sister and two brothers, and I am the youngest. One of my brothers
is in Egypt and my sister and other brother…I don’t know where they are.</p>
<p>Life in Libya was so easy and everything was cheap. School
is so different in my country. I really love school so it was so easy for me to
be good. For me when I was first going to school I felt like I was going to an
amusement park. But for some other kids it’s like going to war and that’s true
because if you are going to war and you know how to use your brain or your gun
then you’ll definitely die. School was the same because if you didn’t study hard
and score high then you’ll get beaten by a wire and sometimes a stick. So you
always compete with your classmates and your best friends to be the best of the
best.</p>
<p>Back in Libya we didn’t have medical insurance. You pay for
yourself from your own pocket, but for other injuries it’s free, all you have
to do is buy your medicine. In February 2011 Libyan started their violent
protest against the president. At that time my dad was in another country and
my brothers and sister went to visit my aunt. So it was only me and my mom. Living
in a house with an open ceiling living room so when they fight outside we can
hear them right in front of the house. We slept in on room and locked the door
on us during the night and when we open the door in the morning there were
hundreds of bullets everywhere, every day for two months. For two months we
only went shopping twice. I use to dress like a boy so nobody asks me something
because during that time they kidnapped hundreds of kids, women, and even
little girls, and rape them and kill them. That’s why I even cut my hair like a
boy – no one could recognize me. It was really risky going out alone but if I
didn’t we could have died from starving. After that the atmosphere calmed down
a little bit so my dad came and decided to go to Egypt, but we couldn’t contact
my siblings so we just went to Egypt and stayed at a refugee camp located
between Libya and Egypt’s border. We stayed there for almost 4 years.</p>
<p>We lived in a house that was made of sand, blankets,
plastic, and wood. We made them by ourselves. We had three meals a day for each
and a bottle of water. I use to keep all the water and sell it so I could buy
us good food to eat. Finally after 4 years I came here to the US. I was really
happy that I left that scary place, but it was really different from my country.
My country is so loud. When in the streets you see a lot of kids playing,
people walking, you hear loud music from stores and car horns. Everything was
loud, but here is so quiet. </p>
<p>When I first came I didn’t really speak English very well. I
only knew how to say “My name is Sara”, “help me”, and a few words. Sometimes I
feel bad because when I ask people walking on the street about the time or to
give me directions they would walk away from me. I didn’t know why, I thought
maybe because of how I dressed. Other times people were really curious – they asked
me about my hijab and my country and sometimes about my religion. I didn’t
really feel homesick then.</p>
<p>The school here is really good. You have the opportunity to
choose your classes and teachers are very good – and of course, there are no
beatings! I didn’t have any problems at school, everyone is so nice.</p>
<p>After I graduate from High School I want to go to college
and study even harder than now and become a good doctor. It has been my dream
since I was a little girl because I really like helping others, it makes me so
happy. But sometimes I feel like being a lawyer to help seek justice because in
so many places in the world there is a lot of unfairness. After all, all I
really want to do is help people. </p>

at least the first few years after I came back. Then, with time, it faded, and
I moved on. Until last Fourth of July. I was with my family on Montauk beach watching
the fireworks and my youngest, 2 years old, was terrified. He tried to run away
high up on a sand dune so I ran after him, caught him, picked him up and tried
to console him. The kid just went limp. My son didn’t move, didn’t make a
sound, and just fell asleep, almost instantly. All of a sudden I was back,
kicking in doors and raiding homes. In one, there stood a man, he might have
been affiliated with Al Qaeda, who knows…but he had a son under the age of five
in the upstairs room. There was shooting and yelling, and the kid just slept. I
picked him up and brought him to his mother, and although he was unhurt he
wouldn’t wake up. He just went limp.
  There
is one nightmare I have. We took over a hospital and, after a day of fighting,
a man brought his son in. The son was obviously dead…maybe 7 or 8 years old. He
was flopping around in his dad’s arms. The father was laughing uncontrollably –
maniacally. I never forgot it.
  Refugees
are close to my heart. I have students now who are teenagers who were in Iraq
when I was there eleven years ago. When I see my students I see the crowds of
little kids who begged for pencils and candy; I see the kids who walked to
school until they canceled school so we could fight. I broke their desks to
burn to keep warm in December, and our sniper took a position in an elementary
classroom. I see the boy whose leg was burned, and the little limp sleeper who
had guns pointed at him, and the laughing dad. I see them in my own kids,
somehow. It haunts me.
  These
kids from Iraq, as well as refugees from other places in the Middle East,
Africa, Burma, and Nepal, didn’t choose to have war or persecution happen to
them. They didn’t choose the actions of their countries or of ours. They all
have their own stories, but somehow, they made it here. They have an obligation
to make the most out of their lives, and they know it. It’s a second chance
many don’t get. What are they going to do with this new life they were given? 
We want this scholarship fund to
help refugees pay for college, and we are asking for your help. We need a
minimum of $25,000 for an endowment, which would give a small scholarship every
single year, forever. I would like to reach $100,000…that’s our goal. Any
little bit helps. Thank you for reading, and if you have any questions please
don’t hesitate to leave a comment. Thank you again! 
Scholarship Details
An endowment has been set up through SUNY Albany. If the goal
is reached, then a percentage of the principal will be given as a scholarship
to a capital district refugee student every year, forever. If the goal is not
reached, the money still goes as a single scholarship, but there will be no
endowment and the money will only be given once. This is a 501c3 project and so
there are tax benefits to donating!
Refugee Students from Albany HighAyatMy name is Ayat.  I’m 19 years old and from Iraq. I lived and studied in Iraq until 2005. I went to Ebn Majid School in Baghdad. And like almost every other student, I tried very hard to get good grades and make my parents proud.After the war in 2003 everything I knew changed. I rarely went to school; it was closed most of the times in the beginning. My school was next to three targeted places: a mosque for Sunni people, Husainia (where Shea people pray), and a police station. I still remember most of the explosions happened and I still remember how we prayed for the student’s and friends that we lost. One day that I will never forget was when they bombed the police station and the windows broke upon our heads. Everyone was running and screaming. It’s both funny and scary how everything you said you would do to protect your home becomes nothing when it comes to your life. However, I couldn’t run further than the school’s wall because I was looking my younger sister. I thought I lost her. I cried and asked for help but everyone was busy saving their lives because usually one explosion is not enough. My sister is way stronger than me. She came laughing and asking why I didn’t run home. I think she was taking it like a game. I took her hand and we ran home like everyone did.They stopped closing the schools when people got use to the sound of explosions and many kids already knew how dead bodies look like. Sometimes, when something explodes in the morning, we just wait until noon to go to school and hear the principle’s speech. She always mentions how brave and strong we are and how the future of the country depends on us. I think it always worked because every kid likes to feel like a superhero. I left Iraq two years after. And never went back.My dad took us to the United Arab Emirates. We found peace in there but as refugees we couldn’t have the rights that other people had. Many refugees couldn’t stay long because no one wanted us there. They made every day harder than the one before and it was also expensive to live there. I went to night school with my sister and my dad had to work three jobs to pay for it. Soon we found that there is no way we can live there.So we moved to Jordan in 2009. And as almost everyone who lived there can say, it is expensive and there were no jobs. We had to live in a small place in the attic of some building. But at least we didn’t have to pay for our education. The schools there were dirty, so cold in winter, and as I remember most of the classes had 45 students in it. Sometimes you can’t breathe. Students, including me, lived what I like to call “psychological war”. They keep repeating that their life will end if they didn’t get an average above 90. And for some it did end. It’s hard when your future is decided by a single percentage point like it did for students in Jordan.When I reached the 12th grade I had to drop high school. It wasn’t free anymore and my dad couldn’t afford it or the books. I think that’s the point when I started hating anyone who doesn’t respect a book because I’ve always felt that books should be in reach of every human’s hand. I still remember how much I cried and prayed to get a chance to finish high school. After all, I was raised with the idea that education is the only way to get a good, respectful life. My dad always used to say to me and my two sisters “If I can’t give you money and a life like princesses have, I will try my best to educate you to get it for yourselves, and that is my inheritance for you “. He did his best and still does.When I struggled in both UAE and Jordan, I couldn’t always feel it because I calmed myself with saying I’ve seen worse. My Family and I were blessed and lucky because America accepted us. I will never forget the moment we arrived the JFK Airport. All the fire, pain and chaos in my heart stopped; finally we found a place that we can call a second home.I want to study Aerospace Engineering. And I want to have the chance to make up all the bad years that my family been through. This is just a small sample of what refugees face in their lives. I want to say that life isn’t easy to all of us, but if you have a home, and a chance to educate yourself, then love it, appreciate it and try your best to protect it. Because somewhere on this planet there are many people who just want to reach their home in one piece, and many other people who need a little money, not to buy a pair of shoes, but to buy books. And believe it or not I’m certain that all of them wish to have the life that you have. Because I once did.BhimMy name is Bhim. I was born in Bhutan, but my earliest memories are from a refugee camp in eastern Nepal. The Camp was a city made of plastic and tin huts built with ever present mud and bamboo stems. I spent 15 years of my life there. I have many memories there with my beautiful family and parents.I also faced a lot of obstacles during my time in the refugee camp. We lived in a hut made of bamboo and sun dried molded bricks; the roof was made of plastic and bamboo sticks. Our bathroom was a hole on the ground right outside of the house. There was not much privacy. Other family members could easily see you bare parts. My house was not that strong either. The slightest wind or rain used to wreak havoc on our existence. It used to rain for months during the summer.In the refugee camp, we had limited access to health care, and although what we had was free, there used to be a long line to see a doctor. Many people with fevers and other deadly diseases needed to wait for days before they could be seen by the doctor. He was a medically trained person, but we used to call him “doctor” because he was the only one we had seen around there prescribing medicine to patients.One day we learned that the United States was letting people in the camp apply for immigration to the United States. My parents were in doubt, initially, but once we heard about the better life in the USA, they jumped at the chance to move and applied for immigration. Moving to a new country with a new language, culture, and lifestyle was not easy. We knew very little and were a bit afraid. It made us very nervous and concerned. We knew we would be starting a life from scratch in another country.We were driven from Bhutan for being of an ethnicity and religion that was different from that of the King, even though my family had lived in Bhutan for four generations and long before the collapse of the British Empire. After living in Nepal as a refugee, as a nationless being, we embarked on the journey to a destination with hope, but nothing else. We heard about terrible stories from people who had arrived in the U.S. before us. They were facing a very difficult life. My family still had nightmarish memories of dragging little kids out of Bhutan, leaving the land and life they had built. We thought we were repeating the same saga once again. Along with the decision to immigrate to the U.S., we also gave up any hope of returning to our land and house in Bhutan.Even after I got to the U.S.A. I was scared. I do not know what I was scared of, but it took years before that fear went away. I knew no rules and regulations. I was struggling at school with all new subject matter, language, and style. At the same time, I was amazed when I saw so many different kinds of people. I quickly learned diversity was not unique to my home town, but true of every city in U.S. I became more comfortable with the language, culture, and rules. I started to make friends. Life suddenly felt much better; my parents and teachers played a critical role in making this happen. I am really thankful to them. I am extremely happy with what I have achieved, but I know that I have just started my journey.MalakMy name is Malak, I’m 18 years old student in Albany high, and I’m originally from Iraq. I left my country in 2006 and I didn’t go back, not even for a visit.Me and people from my country have been through a lot since the war started. Life wasn’t easy at all. I still remember my friend, Rania, who went to shop for school supplies with her father when all of a sudden a bomb exploded next to them and turned them into pieces. That was a horrible thing to see and live with for anybody, especially to a 7 years old girl like me.We were deprived of our basic rights, we spent long days and nights without stepping outside from my house because we were afraid of the explosions that were happening, and we also stopped going to school for months because of the battles that happened in Baghdad. There were two strategic places next to my school, a mosque and a police station, which were always bombed. And sometimes in the days that an explosion happens, we do go to school, but delayed for 2 hours.So after all these events, we were forced to leave Baghdad and go to UAE. We faced many obstacles in the 5 years that we lived there. The high cost of visa, lodging, and school, we were simply unwelcomed as refugees to stay and live there, so we moved to Jordan only for one reason, to come to America. We lived there for 5 years, and because we were not citizens, we couldn’t work and if we did, we would go to jail or be sent back to Iraq, which was a certain fate of death.We’ve been through a harsh circumstances, we couldn’t afford the expensive life there; luckily the schools were free, except for the 12th grade which we have to pay. We couldn’t afford that so we had to leave school for a year. Until the day we all waited for, the refugees organization (IOM) called us and said: your flight to Albany, New York will be in April 8, does this date works for you?  We couldn’t agree more, or be happier. It was the best moment of my life.So here I am, I’m here for almost a year, and I’m so grateful to be alive, to come to this great country, with my ambition to be a pharmacist one day. But I know that whatever happens, my family and I will be safe and have opportunities that we wouldn’t otherwise have, opportunities that are still just a beautiful dream to a lot of people, just like it was to us.
Saw
Hi! My name is Saw Pre Pre…ok! I was born in Burma, Mon
state (not Karen state). Because of the war my parents were worried if I was
born in Karen state that there would not be a nurse to help. Also, my mother
might not have had time to give birth because of running from Burmese soldiers.
I think you can already picture it in your head. Look…when I was young my life
wasn’t fulfilled and I didn’t get what I wanted – basically food, education,
clothes. If I were to compare American kids and refugee kids they are oil and
water. 
I didn’t live in a refugee camp, but that doesn’t mean I’m
not a refugee…I’m a REFUGEE from BURMA!!! Who has run from the Burmese
military, who has attacked the Karen people. 
My school was like a living room, a tiny tiny living room. You know when
I lived there I saw many students in school buses with their beautiful uniforms,
but I had the unlucky curse of being a refugee, and they didn’t allow us to
attend a citizen’s school. Because of the education I’m so upset, I feel down,
all the time when my parents look at me their sympathy goes out to me. 
At that time we are registered to come to America but my mom
is scared because of the new strange STRANGE STRANGE place. In the US, there
are different living styles, food, culture, etc…OK!!! Let me ask you, have you
ever thought of going to a strange place to live? How does that feel? Because
my mom was nervous! Finally, I can go to school without any sadness, because
here in Albany High School we can learn along with the citizens, and everyone
is equal in speech and freedoms. 
Sara
My name is Sara Mohamed. I am 16 years old and I am Libyan
Sudanese. My parents are from Sudan and me and my siblings were born in Libya.
I have one sister and two brothers, and I am the youngest. One of my brothers
is in Egypt and my sister and other brother…I don’t know where they are.
Life in Libya was so easy and everything was cheap. School
is so different in my country. I really love school so it was so easy for me to
be good. For me when I was first going to school I felt like I was going to an
amusement park. But for some other kids it’s like going to war and that’s true
because if you are going to war and you know how to use your brain or your gun
then you’ll definitely die. School was the same because if you didn’t study hard
and score high then you’ll get beaten by a wire and sometimes a stick. So you
always compete with your classmates and your best friends to be the best of the
best.
Back in Libya we didn’t have medical insurance. You pay for
yourself from your own pocket, but for other injuries it’s free, all you have
to do is buy your medicine. In February 2011 Libyan started their violent
protest against the president. At that time my dad was in another country and
my brothers and sister went to visit my aunt. So it was only me and my mom. Living
in a house with an open ceiling living room so when they fight outside we can
hear them right in front of the house. We slept in on room and locked the door
on us during the night and when we open the door in the morning there were
hundreds of bullets everywhere, every day for two months. For two months we
only went shopping twice. I use to dress like a boy so nobody asks me something
because during that time they kidnapped hundreds of kids, women, and even
little girls, and rape them and kill them. That’s why I even cut my hair like a
boy – no one could recognize me. It was really risky going out alone but if I
didn’t we could have died from starving. After that the atmosphere calmed down
a little bit so my dad came and decided to go to Egypt, but we couldn’t contact
my siblings so we just went to Egypt and stayed at a refugee camp located
between Libya and Egypt’s border. We stayed there for almost 4 years.
We lived in a house that was made of sand, blankets,
plastic, and wood. We made them by ourselves. We had three meals a day for each
and a bottle of water. I use to keep all the water and sell it so I could buy
us good food to eat. Finally after 4 years I came here to the US. I was really
happy that I left that scary place, but it was really different from my country.
My country is so loud. When in the streets you see a lot of kids playing,
people walking, you hear loud music from stores and car horns. Everything was
loud, but here is so quiet. 
When I first came I didn’t really speak English very well. I
only knew how to say “My name is Sara”, “help me”, and a few words. Sometimes I
feel bad because when I ask people walking on the street about the time or to
give me directions they would walk away from me. I didn’t know why, I thought
maybe because of how I dressed. Other times people were really curious – they asked
me about my hijab and my country and sometimes about my religion. I didn’t
really feel homesick then.
The school here is really good. You have the opportunity to
choose your classes and teachers are very good – and of course, there are no
beatings! I didn’t have any problems at school, everyone is so nice.
After I graduate from High School I want to go to college
and study even harder than now and become a good doctor. It has been my dream
since I was a little girl because I really like helping others, it makes me so
happy. But sometimes I feel like being a lawyer to help seek justice because in
so many places in the world there is a lot of unfairness. After all, all I
really want to do is help people.",8.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Warum Prävention sexueller Gewalt wichtig ist<br/>
</h3>
Täglich werden Kinder in Mosambik Opfer von sexueller Gewalt - für die Betroffenen eine einschneidende Erfahrung mit oftmals langfristigen Folgen. Doch die meisten Fälle kommen nicht ans Tageslicht, weil die Opfer aufgrund von Angst und Scham schweigen, oder niemand ihnen Glauben schenkt. Verschiedene Mythen fördern den Missbrauch in Mosambik, etwa dass AIDS durch Sex mit einer Jungfrau geheilt werden könne. Auch verlangen Lehrpersonen von den Schülerinnen und Schülern Sex als Gegenleistung für gute Noten. Schliesslich kommt es häufig vor, dass minderjährige Mädchen an erwachsene Männer verheiratet werden. Erschwerend kommt hinzu, dass Sexualität und sexuelle Gewalt in Mosambik Tabu-Themen sind und die Kinder deshalb kaum über ihre Rechte und über Sexualität aufgeklärt werden.  <br/><br/>

Video: Der Beitrag im mosambikanischen Fernsehen (auf Portugiesisch) vermittelt Eindrücke des Projekts.Erprobt und weit gereist: von Deutschland über die Schweiz nach Mosambik
Das Ausstellungsprojekt wurde ursprünglich in Deutschland beim Präventionsbüro Petze in Kiel entwickelt (Echt Klasse!) und geht seither mit Erfolg an Deutsche Schulen. Danach hat es die Stiftung Kinderschutz Schweiz in die Schweiz geholt und bietet es seit bald zehn Jahren an Schweizer Primarschulen an. Mit grossem Erfolg. Viele Kantone haben das Projekt ""Mein Körper gehört mir!"" bereits in ihr ständiges Programm aufgenommen. Im 2010 hat der Verein ARES das Projekt nach Mosambik geholt. Es wurde kulturell adaptiert, sodass es für den mosambikanischen Kontext funktioniert. Und es funktioniert tatsächlich. Eine unabhängige Evaluation hat dem Projekt sehr gute Noten ausgestellt. Aufgrund seines niederschwelligen Ansatzes schafft es das Projekt, ein Tabuthema wie sexuelle Gewalt in Mosambik auf's Tapet zu bringen. Statt Berührungsängsten begegnen wir Neugier und Lernfreude. Die beste Voraussetzung, dass die Botschaften nachhaltige Wirkung entfalten können.",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>The
Ancestors Remembered/Diamonds From Coal Interactive Listening Learning Project
is a series of short-story books with accompanying CD/MP3 soundtracks, a lesson
plan plus an action plan that motivates African Americans and people of color to
learn more about themselves. It infuses them with an emotional attachment to
success. </p>
<p>Volume 1
has seven (7) narrative stories with relevant poetry that grasp the
listener/reader and encourages them to do better socially, educationally and
economically. The narrative stories are performed theatrically in the
vernacular of those 18<sup>th</sup>, 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup>
century African Americans who shaped and molded the direction of this country.
The stories are a blend of factual data and fiction that make for lively
discussion and healthy research projects which help raise the self-esteem of
each participant. </p>
<p>In
keeping with the Amistad Commission’s mandate this project has a performance
art component with an innovative educational process that is challenging,
engaging and inspiring. It has the clinical support of several academicians who
tested the project with their students. The seven volume series will be a major
instrument in strengthening and enriching the lives of those in marginalized
African American communities by using a cutting-edge modality that shifts the
thinking of the black population while fostering ingenuity and productivity. </p>
<p>The project
involves further research and development of the 49 written stories, including
they’re subsequent publication and distribution. It will also involve project
promotion that would include attending conferences and conventions in major
cities with large concentrations of African Americans. This innovative
public-education project uses the arts to educate as a cultural enrichment
medium to affect positive social change.</p>
<p><b><u>Purpose</u></b></p>
<p>The purpose of the Ancestors Remembered-Diamonds From Coal
Interactive Listening Series is to raise self-esteem among African American
students from 13 to 26 years old, from middle school through graduate courses.  The focal point of the series is to abate the
high levels of crime, violence, sexual promiscuity, extreme incarceration rates
and toxic levels of substance abuse found in the African American community. </p>
<p>We
accomplish this goal by providing an educational program that incorporates
ancient African wisdom, poetry, modern hip-hop culture, creative writing,
theatrical interpretation and 21<sup>st</sup> century internet technology. This
will develop positive and productive young American citizens.  The program has also been tested with
incarcerated youth age 13 to 26 with highly favorable results.</p>
<p>There is
a national need for more positive images of African American ancestry,
particularly as it applies to youth and young adults in America’s inner cities
and some rural areas.  Low test scores,
high dropout rates, escalating substance abuse, mounting reports of irresponsible
sexual behavior, soaring incidents of crime and violence, and
disproportionately high incarceration rates have become almost common place
within many African American communities. These self-destructive behaviors can be directly associated with
low self-esteem and little-to-no interest in educational advancement. This
program addresses those needs at the cognitive level and is a conduit for
social change.</p>

</p><p>YOUR SUPPORT WILL GO TO MEDICATION, FOOD and EDUCATION for ORPHANS of the 2014-15 EBOLA OUTBREAK<br/></p><p>Hello!
My name is Joseph Hindogbae Kposowa, but most people call me Hindo. I am a
youth leader in my community (Bumpe Ngao Chiefdom in Southern Sierra Leone), where
I lead a team of youngsters and teachers developing grassroots strategies for
confronting local challenges. My primary focus is to ensure quality education
and health, and to foster community mobilization for development. </p>
<p>Bumpe Ngao Chiefdom had 47 confirmed Ebola cases and 20 deaths -- leaving a lot of young orphans from 1-14 years of age. Children
were less impacted by Ebola and had greater chances of survival. As a result, many of these children
lost their fathers, who were bread winners and pillars for their families.
Relatives cannot provide well for these children to go to school, receive medication, or even receive the food they need to thrive. Many women
lost their husbands, and they are seriously traumatized and struggling to raise
their children under these extreme circumstances. </p>
<p>These children are leaders of tomorrow. Meeting their need for food, medication and education will improve the lives of these orphans significantly. They have
survived the infection and know the bitterness of the outbreak! Your support
will help them grow up to be leaders who face community challenges with solutions for
their people, and who give back to those who cared for them during their moments of struggle. </p>
<p>Be part of these emerging leaders' growth! We will keep you updated on how these children are doing in their education through our Facebook page:<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Global-Education-and-Justice%20Network/303984359807190?ref=aymt_homepage_panel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Global-Education-and-Justice

<br/></div>","YOUR SUPPORT WILL GO TO MEDICATION, FOOD and EDUCATION for ORPHANS of the 2014-15 EBOLA OUTBREAKHello!
My name is Joseph Hindogbae Kposowa, but most people call me Hindo. I am a
youth leader in my community (Bumpe Ngao Chiefdom in Southern Sierra Leone), where
I lead a team of youngsters and teachers developing grassroots strategies for
confronting local challenges. My primary focus is to ensure quality education
and health, and to foster community mobilization for development. 
Bumpe Ngao Chiefdom had 47 confirmed Ebola cases and 20 deaths -- leaving a lot of young orphans from 1-14 years of age. Children
were less impacted by Ebola and had greater chances of survival. As a result, many of these children
lost their fathers, who were bread winners and pillars for their families.
Relatives cannot provide well for these children to go to school, receive medication, or even receive the food they need to thrive. Many women
lost their husbands, and they are seriously traumatized and struggling to raise
their children under these extreme circumstances. 
These children are leaders of tomorrow. Meeting their need for food, medication and education will improve the lives of these orphans significantly. They have
survived the infection and know the bitterness of the outbreak! Your support
will help them grow up to be leaders who face community challenges with solutions for
their people, and who give back to those who cared for them during their moments of struggle. 
Be part of these emerging leaders' growth! We will keep you updated on how these children are doing in their education through our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Global-Education-and-Justice
Network/303984359807190?ref=aymt_homepage_panel
READ THE ORPHANS' STORY:
1. 
Charlie (3 years old) and Solomon Abdulai Jr (6 years old) lost both parents
to Ebola in Kaniya Village. Their late parents, Gbessay Abdulai (25) and Father (36) died in the Ebola struggle after their mother Gbessay contracted the
disease. Charlie and Solomon are now staying with their grandfather, Solomon
Abdulai (68) who struggles to provide and care for Charlie and Solomon. Charlie
and Solomon are most times left alone because everyone in the community still
attaches stigmas to their condition, so they won't carry the boys or allow their kids to play with them. 
2. 
Aruna (5), Baindu (8), Umaru (12) and Duada Mansaray (14) lost their
mother and father three years ago before the Ebola outbreak. Their grandmother Bintu Mansaray (60) who was caring for them, died of Ebola after washing someone who died of Ebola in Baomahun village. In Baomahun village, 20 people
were infected, with 12 deaths and 8 survivors.  Aruna, Baindu, Umaru and Duada are now staying with their uncle, Brima Mansaray (35), a farmer who already has a family of 11 to support.  
3. 
Jennifer (2), Jamah (9), and Matilda Williams (12) lost their
mother, Gloria Williams, to Ebola in Kaniya Village where 12 people were
infected. Their father, Solomon Williams (48) is a farmer. At two years of age, Jennifer needs nutritional help to grow. She needs toys to replace her mom's lost
presence. Her father Solomon is struggling to care for her whilst the farm
work doubles for him at this particular season. 
4. 
Jolly (5) and Lamin (9) lost their father, John Williams (50) to
Ebola in Bunimbu Village. Their late father was a driver and the bread winner
of the home. Jolly and Lamin's mother, Martha (45) is finding it very difficult
to afford feeding them as she struggles with the psychological trauma of losing her husband. 
5. 
Regina (14), John (12), Martin (9) lost their mother, Bumpe-Nya
Kindo (52) who was a single parent. Regina, John and Martin are presently
struggling on their own since their mom separated from their father five years before her death. Their father is yet to accept them. 
6. 
Edna Ngaoja (7) lost her mother, Edna Ngaoja (53) to Ebola. Edna
was a single parent caring for her daughter Edna. Edna (the daughter) is now staying with her uncle, Mohamed Ngaoja (42), a farmer. 
7. 
Jeneba -(1) and Sammah (5) lost their father Lahai Sam (a farmer)
to Ebola in Baomahun Village. Jeneba, a year old baby, needs support with a nutritional
diet and medication to grow well. Their mother separated with their lost father
few months ago, leaving Jeneba and Sammah with their paternal aunt, Jeneba Sammah (42).
8. 
Madiana (4) and Alieu (7) lost their father Mohamed Kamara (27) to Ebola in Baomahun village. Their mother left their lost father and
disowned Madiana and Alieu two years ago. Madiana is presently malnourished, as
she is not getting enough food. They are staying with their uncle Alusine
Gbondo (32) who has 8 children of his own. Please support Madiana and Alieu.
9. 
John (8) and Mikailu (11) lost their mother, Musu Kamanda (55) to
Ebola in Baomahun village. The late Musu, John and Mikailu were deserted by their
father 5 years ago. Their elder sister, Fatmata (35) is a single parent caring
for John, Mikailu and 10 others.
10.  Jillo (2) lost her father, Munda Moriba (28) to Ebola in Kamarun village where 5 people
were infected with 4 deaths. Jillo's mother is presently 7 months pregnant. 
11.  Aminata (1) lost her father, Mohamed Bangura to Ebola in Yoni Village. Aminata is
care for by her grandmother, Yeawa Ernest.
12.  Nancy
Mansaray (12) lost her father, Lansana Mansaray to Ebola in Kpetema village.
Nancy's mother deserted the late Lansana two years before Lansana's death.

I'm no attorney, but it's my understanding that at least with the United States, donations to churches are tax-deductible even if the church is not 501-c3 status with the IRS.  Here's what the IRS says on their own website:  ""You can deduct your contributions only if you make them to a qualified organization. Most organizations, other than churches
            and governments, must apply to the IRS to become a qualified organization.""  LRN.FM is a project of the Shire Free Church, so you should be fine deducting your donation.  Don't take my word for it, though.  If you pay taxes, which I don't personally recommend, you may want do your own research.  


What are alternative methods to contribute?

<h3>Interactive Neighborhood for Kids </h3> <p>INK is a 501c3  non-profit agency currently located in an industrial area of Gainesville, Georgia.  The mission of INK, a unique children's museum, is to encourage children of all ages to develop their full potential through exciting<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> hands-on learning.  INK strives through interactive exhibits, to create unique environment in which children of all ages, abilities and experiences can feel free to imagine, create and explore beyond their dreams.</span></p>
<p>For over 12 years, INK continues to provide fun, hands-on educational resources for thousands of parents, caregivers, educators and children of all ages.  In 2014, we reached over 70,000 visitors. Our exhibits and programming enable children to use their imagination and creativity in a friendly and safe environment.  Additionally, our exhibits are designed to stimulate curiosity and motivate learning.  INK provides the perfect atmosphere where children and families can have fun and learn together.</p>
<p>Since inception, INK has established itself as a vital educational institution in the North Georgia area.  With rapidly and consistently growing attendance, INK has become very crowded in its current space.  The physical need for expansion is clear, but it is only part of the story.  The most significant motivation for expansion is that young children in our area are not reaching their full potential during early childhood, impacting their chances for success in school and life, and their ability to contribute to the community and country.  </p>
<p>THE NEED:  There continues to be a growing demand for effective learning opportunities for young children and evidence proves that Children's Museums provide those opportunities.   INK has outgrown its current space.  The children of our area need a museum that can continue to serve their expanding educational and developmental needs now, and well into the future.  It's time for INK to grow, and the first step toward that goal is securing a new location for expansion. </p>
<p>A NEW LOCATION:  A donor is willing to donate 3.5 acres located in the middle of our market IF we can raise $2,000,000 by the Summer of 2015 and begin construction.  We have researched many properties and this property fits all of our current and future needs.  Now is the perfect time to update, expand and have a building that the children of North Georgia can call our own.  By moving to this new more populated location, we have the potential to increase our reach to over 420,000 visitors annually.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>The total cost of our building project is 4.3 million dollars.  Our immediate need is 2 million dollars by August 2015 in order to have the property donated to us.  The full 2 million will go directly into the bricks and mortar of the building.  INK has already received $1 million in commitments.  </div>
<div>For the last five years, INK has been self sufficient with our day to day operations.  We have created means of revenue through a small admission fee, birthday party income, memberships, field trips, gift shop and pottery studio in order to cover our cost of rent, utilities, salaries and other costs.  We will be able to continue to cover those costs in the new facility.  In fact, if we can raise enough funds to pay for the total cost of the new building, the funds we were applying to our rent (1/3 of income) will be able to be used for more programming for our visitors. </div>
<div>If we do not reach our goal of 2 million dollars for this location, we will continue to reserve these funds until a new location is found.</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will make a huge difference on each child that visits our museum. <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Children are able to experience and learn real life skills each time they walk through our doors at INK.  Our exhibits are set up to be mock businesses that are scaled down to a  child's size.  Each child no matter their ability has the opportunity to step into the world of many different careers that are located in our community and experience what it is like to be that person.  Great examples of roles the children can become are a doctor, pilot, fireman, policeman, grocery store clerk, dairy farmers and much more.  We focus on children ages 2-12 however we find that any age has a great time at INK. </span></p>

<p><span>INK is now beginning our 13th year of business.  We have had an average annual growth of 10%+.  In the beginning, INK was reaching just a few families in our community and now our reach spreads over 26+ counties and has become a great destination for visitors from all over the world!  Organized field trips have come from as far as 3+ hours away to experience our learning concept.  With serving 70,000+ visitors annually, we have reached our maximum capacity at our current location.  We need more space and a location closer to a more populated location in order to reach more children eager to learn and explore.  We have people calling very often wanting to know how to create a model in their community to make this concept available to needy children in their area.  As you can see, the need is there.  We need your help to make this project happen!</span></p>

The Impact


  This is your opportunity to be part of an ongoing work that is shaping and improving children's lives even if you never get a chance to go to Africa you can still be a part by helping us financially. You can be sure that every penny donated will go to the work and any extra will go to buying school supplies.   
We have been building in Uganda since the year 2000 and to date we have built 2 school buildings, an admin block, a boys dormitory, a large dining hall, an orphanage, a medical centre and a church  as well as digging 2 borehole wells all this has been done as the funds have come in. Check out our website at www.advanceinternational.org.uk.
     Risks & Challenges   We started going to Uganda in 1997 and then when we became a charity 3 years later  we began to build. It was quite a culture shock at first but as we got to know the people we found them to be very loving and trusting and also needy, which captured our hearts and so began our work out there and even though we live in UK we are still able to visit the work once a year and meet up with Pastor Dan who oversees it all. Our main challenge is money obviously and while we have some sponsors it would be good to have more.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Even if you cannot give in to the work we respectfully ask you to consider sharing about what we do  with your friends, get the word out for us and still be a part of a happening. You can  use the Indiegogo share tools which will be a great help.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

According to the National Report Card on Youth Financial Literacy, 93% of youth think it is important to learn about finances.

Aidés d’une équipe qui croit en l’importance d’un tel projet pour la société, nous avons décidé de concevoir un jeu basé sur l’éducation financière pour des joueurs âgés de  8 ans et plus. Pourquoi un tel sujet pour un jeu ? En fait, j’ai grandi sans recevoir une quelconque éducation financière et ce fut la même chose pour mes parents. Aujourd’hui, arrivé à l’âge adulte et avec des responsabilités familiales, j’ai vite constaté qu’il est important de savoir gérer ses sous qui ont très souvent été durement gagnés. </span></p>

I grew up with a love for video games and I believe that now is the time to play more seriously. With the help of a team that believes in the importance of such a project for our society, we have decided to design a game for children (ages 8 and up), based on financial education. Why choose this topic for a game? I grew up without receiving any financial education and it was the same case for my parents. Today, as an adult with significant family responsibilities, I quickly realized how important it is to know how to manage our often hard-earned money.
This game will enable young children, as well as older children to clearly understand the mechanisms necessary for managing personal finances. We hope we can count on your help to carry out this project that is very important to us through Indiegogo.Thank you very much for your support,WindorTooniie Land, the gameTooniie Land leads players into an idyllic world where they must help the King restore prosperity to the island called “Tooniie Land.” This game will help players become familiar with concepts related to: 
Savings
Debt
Spending
Mutual aid
Entrepreneurship
Ethics
Studies show that when financial education is introduced to children at an early age, they develop reflexes that will very useful to them in adulthood.How to play this game ?First, players should become familiar with the king’s different weekly missions, then select a boat that will enable them to navigate to the selected islands. They will have to manage the craft and make sure to follow a budget enabling them to carry out the various missions. Each week (everyThursday), they will receive a virtual salary that they will have to manage in keeping with their upcoming journeys. Within the game, they will become familiar with concepts related to loans, budgeting, and taxes.What will we do with your contribution?We are looking for C$90,000. The funds raised will be used to develop the game, namely through: 
Design (graphics, drawings)
Development (coding, animation)
Testing and piloting (quality assurance, detecting bugs)
Market release (marketing, presentation to the public)
If surplus funds are raised, we will use them to work on updates and improve graphics. We also intend for teachers to use the game as a learning tool in a classroom environment. Moreover, we would like to work on a version adapted to young adults and thus reach an older demographic. Timeline

The team


Frequently Asked QuestionsQ:Why a project on financial management and youth?A: Managing personal finances is a very important element in an individual’s life and when this topic is introduced early on, the individual becomes better equipped to make responsible financial decisions that will have a significant, lifelong impact. According to the National Report Card on Youth Financial Literacy, 93% of youth think it is important to learn about finances. According to the same source, 50% of high school graduates are already in debt. Thus we must not delay in educating future generations on this issue. Q: Could this game really be educational for youth?A: We are a very small team, but we are full of creative ideas to turn games into powerful learning tools. This game will help players discover the different aspects of managing personal finances, while being fun and entertaining. Q: Will it be possible to play this game on multiple platforms?
A: The game will be offered on iPhones, iPads, Android devices, PCs, and laptops.
Q: Will there be interaction between players?
A: We hope to develop generosity between players. They will be able to make requests by simply clicking on icons. 

Q: When will the project be ready?
A: At the end of the campaign and once we have reached our goal, development will take 90 to 100 days, approximately 3 months.

Bienvenue 


J’ai grandi avec un grand amour pour les jeux vidéo et je crois qu’est maintenant venu le temps de jouer plus sérieusement. Aidés d’une équipe qui croit en l’importance d’un tel projet pour la société, nous avons décidé de concevoir un jeu basé sur l’éducation financière pour des joueurs âgés de  8 ans et plus. Pourquoi un tel sujet pour un jeu ? En fait, j’ai grandi sans recevoir une quelconque éducation financière et ce fut la même chose pour mes parents. Aujourd’hui, arrivé à l’âge adulte et avec des responsabilités familiales, j’ai vite constaté qu’il est important de savoir gérer ses sous qui ont très souvent été durement gagnés. 




Ce jeu permettra aux jeunes enfants, mais aussi aux plus grands de bien comprendre les mécanismes liés à la gestion des finances personnelles.






Nous espérons pouvoir compter sur vous à travers IndieGoGo afin de réaliser ce projet que nous avons à coeur. 
Merci infiniment pour votre support.

Tooniie Land, le jeu

Tooniie Land est une aventure conduisant les joueurs dans un monde paradisiaque où ils devront aider le roi à ramener la prospérité au sein de l’île nommée  «Tooniie Land». Ce jeu permettra aux joueurs de se familiariser aux concepts liés à : 

L’épargne  
L’endettement 
La consommation
L’entraide
L’entrepreneurship
L’éthique 




Les études démontrent que lorsqu’on débute l’éducation financière très tôt chez un jeune enfant, celui-ci développe des réflexes qui lui seront très utiles dans sa vie d’adulte.Comment jouer à ce jeu ?




Les joueurs devront d’abord prendre connaissance des différentes missions du roi pour la semaine et par la suite, choisir un bateau qui leur permettra de naviguer vers les îles sélectionnées. Ils devront gérer l’ensemble de l’embarcation et s’assurer de tenir un budget leur permettant d’effectuer les différentes traversées. À toutes les semaines (chaque jeudi), ils recevront un salaire virtuel qu’ils devront gérer en fonction des prochaines traversées qu’ils réaliseront. Au sein du jeu, ils pourront se familiariser avec les concepts liés à la taxation, aux emprunts, au budget ainsi qu’aux impôts.

Que ferons-nous de votre contribution ?

Nous sommes à la recherche de 90 000$ canadien. Les fonds amassés serviront à couvrir les frais du développement du jeu :

Design (recherche graphique, illustrations)
Développement (codage, animation)
Test et pilotage (assurance qualité, recherche de bogues)
Mise en marché (marketing, présentation grand public)

En cas où des surplus seraient amassés, nous utiliserions ces fonds supplémentaires afin de travailler sur des mises à jour et des améliorations au niveau graphique. Nous aimerions aussi permettre à des enseignants d’utiliser le jeu comme outil d’apprentissage dans un contexte scolaire.
Nous aimerions également travailler sur une version adaptée aux jeunes adultes et ainsi toucher les personnes plus âgées.

Q : Est-ce que ce jeu pourra réellement être éducatif pour les jeunes ?
R: Nous sommes une toute petite équipe, mais nous regorgeons de créativité afin de transformer les jeux en un puissant outil d’apprentissage. Ce jeu permettra de découvrir les différents aspects liés à la gestion des finances personnelles tout en étant amusant et en ajoutant une touche d’humour.

How You Can Help
 For $75, a poet teacher can teach one classroom, exposing those students to the art of poetry, given the opportunity to learn from a published poet, and enabled to find their own inner voice to produce their own poems and share them with the world. While some schools are able to fund workshops with our poet teachers, tight budgets have put this resource in jeopardy for the students who might benefit the most.

The Impact
 
California Poets in the Schools calls on a multitalented, multicultural, multilingual roster of over 125 published poets who are specially trained to bring their experience and love for their craft into classrooms in their own communities. In CPitS workshops, kids learn to read deeply, to write with confidence, to stand up in public and recite, and perhaps most deeply, to understand what they have to say has value in the world.

<p>As high school students, they need these supplies because they are preparing to enter a world that is rapidly changing.  They need as many opportunities as possible

<p><b>John Kiriakou's Goals and Projects</b></p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is based on the need for John Kiriakou and his family to recover financially and personally from the retaliatory campaign by the Justice Department undertook to destroy him and to allow him to move forward with his plans to bring awareness and educate Americans through seminars, Op-Ed articles, broadcasting, speeches, books and reaching out in whatever way he can. The topics of his focus include:</p>
<p>• Whistleblower rights<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">• Prison Reform<span><br/></span><span>• Transparency in Government<span><br/></span></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">• Changing the practice of torture<span><br/></span><span>• Protecting Privacy and Your Privacy Rights</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>In the end, John Kiriakou believes he can stretch the net campaign funds six to eight months or more and still accomplish his goals. In fact, one of his most important personal goals is to reach a financial stability that will allow him to stop taking donations on his <a href=""http://www.johnkiriakou.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> and create a donation portal for other whistleblowers like Jeffrey Sterling. Jeffrey is in the beginning days of his imprisonment and John knows how much help his family will need. John can help him with that burden.</p>

John Kiriakou needs your support because he is in a unique position to speak out and be heard. His experience could be the experience of anyone who speaks out against wrongdoings by the government. Until his speeches and books and broadcast efforts begin to provide him a living salary and the ability to restructure his financial life, John is still at the mercy of the Justice Department and their destructive and retaliatory actions. His efforts to educate, inform and expand awareness require a salary and enough money to support his online presence to promote his good and valuable works.

In the end, John Kiriakou believes he can stretch the net campaign funds six to eight months or more and still accomplish his goals. In fact, one of his most important personal goals is to reach a financial stability that will allow him to stop taking donations on his website and create a donation portal for other whistleblowers like Jeffrey Sterling. Jeffrey is in the beginning days of his imprisonment and John knows how much help his family will need. John can help him with that burden.

Never forget...
As a whistleblower who suffered at the hands of the Justice Department working on behalf of the CIA to shut him up and shut him down, when John was released from prison he vowed to NEVER be silent on the wrongdoings of his country and its agencies.
We will never be truly free nor able to be proud of our great country again if we don't stop the wrongdoing and misconduct by those in the highest positions in the land.

Too many are directly suffering from the axiom: ""Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" And too many suffer indirectly as the economy, the government, and our communities are irreparably damaged by those who simply do not care or care for their own gains more than for the American Way.

We are dedicated to providing high quality online language classes while also creating opportunities to leave a lasting positive impact on classrooms and students throughout the world. Prolangco already provides the flexibility to schedule your private language 
classes around work, school, friends and family commitments. Our 
teaching methods maximize student engagement, and we provide convenient 
tools for payment and scheduling. We match our students and language 
teachers based on their shared location, interests and experiences. Personal relationships, cultural exchanges, use of modern technology and flexibility distinguish Prolangco from other companies.Education matters.
Prolangco has received class requests from students and classrooms all over the world. Growing global interest
 demonstrates the value of our classes. We would like to increase the 
number of paid classes we are able to provide and also offer our 
language classes to individuals who would benefit from them but cannot 
afford them. We are on a mission and need your help!It's education beyond our borders.With the funds from our Indiegogo campaign, we will not only develop a more robust, modern website, which will allow flexible scheduling, student access to online materials and notes, and customized areas of interaction between students, but we will be able to increase our online capabilities with upgraded office equipment, including at least one central server and an expanded high capacity wifi network, and rent a new office starting in August, 2015.  These important primary steps will allow us to incorporate free international large participation English class programs into our business model.Why do we wish to expand our English language program beyond our borders?  We strongly believe that these types of classes will allow our students to 
learn from each other, network, interact, and work together while
 learning the English language, thereby providing positive change, 
compassion, empathy and understanding across multiple cultures. Our Prolangco team in Germany has been providing general language and business english classes
 worldwide for more than three years now, which has allowed us to grow 
slowly but steadily.  We want to take further steps to continue our 
progress.  After all, our slogan is, ""Progress with Prolangco.""Commencing in March, 2015, we began offering a free, one-hour online Business English seminar called ""Connect-Interact-Network."" 
 This webinar allows business entrepreneurs around the world the 
opportunity to discuss current business topics with each other and 
practice their English for free. We would like to expand this type of program to young students worldwide no later than January, 2016. Education is a powerful market for change. Given 
our world's political climate, as well as specific requests from students
 and business people across the globe, we are embarking on a new, and we hope significant, step forward
 - creating MOOC's (see below for description) for young students 
throughout the world, as well as for entrepreneurs, who wish to connect 
with their international counterparts.  As our communities continue to exhibit great
diversity, the need for understanding and accepting the differences among all
people has never been more important.  We strongly prescribe to the principle that, ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."" - Nelson Mandela.
It's time to upend traditional methods of teaching.
What is an MOOC? Excellent question! A massive open online course (MOOC) is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web. In addition to traditional course materials such as filmed lectures, readings, and problem sets, our MOOCs will provide interactive user forums to
 support community interactions between students and their coaches. Not 
only do we hope to get teachers, coaches, and professors from all 7 continents
 involved in our courses, but also, given the economic circumstances 
surrounding many of our anticipated young participants, we wish to make these MOOCs available to our students for free within the next six to eight months.Our team is excited about these projects and their enthusiasm will inspire others to contribute to the nonprofit program. Our teachers will network with professionals throughout the world, make positive contributions to classrooms worldwide, and create a unique cultural immersion within our globe's dynamic entrepreneurial and scholastic communities. Show the world, through your numbers, that you're out there!
Every single pledge brings us one step closer to successfully meeting 
our funding goal.  With your support, we will be able to efficiently 
provide classes for our growing user base and to create our first free worldwide 
educational MOOCs. You will help us in our mission to create opportunities through education and to increase cultural understanding while leaving a lasting positive impact on worldwide communities. Great classes come from great students.A series of short documentary films and updates will chronicle the 
expansion of Prolangco and our experiences building the free 
educational program.  We hope to highlight the personal stories of some of our students on our website. We will also include interviews with our teachers, students and other members of our team.Please join us today and help us to reach international students who wish to communicate, interact and become involved in positive change through the power of language. “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.”

<div>Our idea was to have a small festival against racism and discrimination, but after putting the event on Facebook, it went viral in Belgium.

<p>The <b>Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta</b> rises up
from the Caribbean beaches to the glacial peaks of Colón and Bolívar at 5,775
metres above sea level, the highest coastal range in the world.</p>
<p>It ascends through narrow valleys with rivers
of crystal clear water, through deserts, rainforests, moorlands and perpetual
snow. It is surrounded by the Caribbean Sea, the dry plains of La Guajira, and
the grasslands that border the Magdalena and César rivers<b>.</b></p>
<p><b></b>Four indigenous communities inhabit the
Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. They are the <b>Wiwa</b> (Arzario or Malaya), <b>Kogui</b>,
<b>Arhuaco</b> and <b>Kankuama</b>. For these people the Sierra is the heart of the world.
Their sacred sites, fountains of ancient knowledge must be respected and cared
for. They call themselves the elder brother and their role is to look after the
mother earth on which the whole universe depends.
</p>
<p>Social organisation, clothing and language
vary from group to group, but they share a common view of creation, the Law of
Origin. This Law is written in every place in the Sierra and contains the
principles and rules that govern the spiritual and material lives of the
indigenous communities.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Seiamake</b> is one of six Wiwa communities in
the municipality of Dibulla, in the northern face of the Sierra. In 2012 the
Colombian government expropriated Finca Arimaca, a 600 hectare farm, from a
convicted drug trafficker and gave it to the Wiwa community, who founded
Seiamake. 32 Wiwa families live in Seiamake with about 180 inhabitants of which
64 are children under 15 years.
</p>
</div><div>
<p>The farm buildings consist of 2 houses in
need of repair, a garage without its roof, a dining area without its roof and
some outhouses for animals.</p>They are looking for help to realise two very important projects:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Primary School<br/></b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Meeting Hall</b>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Lo que necesitamos</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Seiamake</b> es una de las seis 
comunidades Wiwa que habitan en Dibulla, un municipio ubicado en la cara
 norte de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, frente al mar caribe de 
Colombia. </p>
<p>La
 comunidad Wiwa Seiamake se organizó en el año 2012, gracias a la 
entrega por parte del Estado colombiano al Pueblo Wiwa, de una extensión
 de tierra de aproximadamente 600 hectáreas conocida en la región con el
 nombre
 de “Finca Arimaca”. Este lugar perteneció en el pasado a un traficante 
de drogas a quien el gobierno le extinguio  el dominio de la tierra, 
entregandolo  al Pueblo Wiwa para que lo habitara y aprovechara. En la 
actualidad en Seiamake habitan 32 familias, que constituyen alrededor de
 180 habitantes, de los cuales 64 son niños menores de 15 años.</p>
<p>La
 Finca Arimaca tiene dos casas deterioradas que necesitan ser reparadas,
 un garaje sin techo y sin puertas, un comedor sin techo ni paredes y un
 establo para ganado.</p>
<p>La comunidad Wiwa de Seiamake esta buscando ayuda para hacer realidad dos proyectos muy importantes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Construcción de la escuela primaria</b></li>
<li><b>Construcción de salón comunitario</b></li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1315449/files/20150322125250-Sophie.jpg?1427053970"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Current State of the Buildings</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1313470/files/20150321123546-buildings.JPG?1426966546"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The existing buildings of Seiamake are in a
bad state of disrepair due to poor maintenance and theft. The roofs, doors,
windows, sanitary fittings, electricity and water systems are all missing. The
existing structures can be repaired and remodeled to suit the needs of the
primary school and meeting hall. <br/></p>
<h3>Estado actual de las edificaciones</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Las edificaciones que 
actualmente existen en Seiamake se encuentran en muy mal estado de 
conservación, debido a la ausencia de mantenimiento y al hurto de sus 
sanitarios, puertas, ventanas. Tampoco cuenta con servicio de 
electricidad ni agua potable. Las
 edificaciones existentes pueden ser reparadas y remodeladas para 
adecuarlas a las necesidades de la escuela primaria y el salón de 
reuniones que se quieren construir.</p>
<h3>The Primary School

</h3>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1313471/files/20150321123608-school.JPG?1426966568"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p> </p>
<p>As in every culture, it is important for
children to learn their native language. In Wiwa culture it is important that
the children start their education under the guidance of the adults, who impart
a collective way of seeing the world which helps to build the child's
personality. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The objective of the primary school is that
the Wiwa children of Seiamake, through <b>Damana</b>, their own language and culture
have a space to learn which complies with a reasonable standard of materials
and building with regard to space, hygiene, ventilation, lighting and comfort.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>La escuela primaria</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Así como en cada cultura es 
natural que los niños aprendan la lengua materna, entre los Wiwa, es 
necesario que se inicie el proceso de aprendizaje de la mano de los 
adultos, que los lleve a apropiarse de una forma colectiva de ver el 
mundo, y a construir su propia personalidad. La niñez es parte 
fundamental de la cultura Wiwa, ya que
 durante ella se aprende la que será su forma de vida, absorbiendo el 
conocimiento ancestral y prácticas tradicionales, así como su relación 
con la naturaleza, a partir de las cuales se construyen las bases para 
la supervivencia como individuo y comunidad, tratando de garantizar la 
permanencia de sus expresiones culturales.</p>
<p>Con
 este proyecto se busca que los niños de Seiamake realicen el proceso de
 aprendizaje de su lengua <b>Damana</b> y de su cultura tradicional en un lugar
 que respete su entorno propio y que a la vez esté dotado de las mínimas

The Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta rises up
from the Caribbean beaches to the glacial peaks of Colón and Bolívar at 5,775
metres above sea level, the highest coastal range in the world.
It ascends through narrow valleys with rivers
of crystal clear water, through deserts, rainforests, moorlands and perpetual
snow. It is surrounded by the Caribbean Sea, the dry plains of La Guajira, and
the grasslands that border the Magdalena and César rivers.
Four indigenous communities inhabit the
Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. They are the Wiwa (Arzario or Malaya), Kogui,
Arhuaco and Kankuama. For these people the Sierra is the heart of the world.
Their sacred sites, fountains of ancient knowledge must be respected and cared
for. They call themselves the elder brother and their role is to look after the
mother earth on which the whole universe depends.

Social organisation, clothing and language
vary from group to group, but they share a common view of creation, the Law of
Origin. This Law is written in every place in the Sierra and contains the
principles and rules that govern the spiritual and material lives of the
indigenous communities.
Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta
Desde las playas del caribe, 
la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta se levanta hasta los picos Colón y 
Bolívar, a 5.775 metros sobre el nivel del mar. 

Asciende
 por valles estrechos con ríos de aguas cristalinas, a través de 
desiertos, bosques húmedos, páramos y nieves perpetuas. La rodean el Mar
 Caribe, las secas planicies de La Guajira, y las sabanas del Río 
Magdalena y el Cesar.
Cuatroetnias
 indígenas habitan la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, los pueblos Wiwa 
(Arzario o Malayo), Kogui, Arhuaco y Kankuamo, para los cuales la Sierra
 es el corazón del mundo. Un sitio sagrado, fuente de conocimiento que 
debe ser cuidado a través del respeto a la naturaleza y el trabajo 
espiritual. Su misión por la cual se
 autodenominan “hermanitos mayores” es la de cuidar a la madre tierra de
 cuya suerte depende la del universo entero. 
La
 organización social, el vestido y la lengua varían entre los cuatro 
grupos, pero los une su visión de la creación, La Ley de Origen. Una ley
 escrita en cada lugar de la Sierra que guarda los principios y normas 
para la vida material y espiritual de los indígenas.

What We Need

Seiamake is one of six Wiwa communities in
the municipality of Dibulla, in the northern face of the Sierra. In 2012 the
Colombian government expropriated Finca Arimaca, a 600 hectare farm, from a
convicted drug trafficker and gave it to the Wiwa community, who founded
Seiamake. 32 Wiwa families live in Seiamake with about 180 inhabitants of which
64 are children under 15 years.


The farm buildings consist of 2 houses in
need of repair, a garage without its roof, a dining area without its roof and
some outhouses for animals.They are looking for help to realise two very important projects:


Primary School


Meeting Hall


  
Lo que necesitamos

Seiamake es una de las seis 
comunidades Wiwa que habitan en Dibulla, un municipio ubicado en la cara
 norte de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, frente al mar caribe de 
Colombia. 
La
 comunidad Wiwa Seiamake se organizó en el año 2012, gracias a la 
entrega por parte del Estado colombiano al Pueblo Wiwa, de una extensión
 de tierra de aproximadamente 600 hectáreas conocida en la región con el
 nombre
 de “Finca Arimaca”. Este lugar perteneció en el pasado a un traficante 
de drogas a quien el gobierno le extinguio  el dominio de la tierra, 
entregandolo  al Pueblo Wiwa para que lo habitara y aprovechara. En la 
actualidad en Seiamake habitan 32 familias, que constituyen alrededor de
 180 habitantes, de los cuales 64 son niños menores de 15 años.
La
 Finca Arimaca tiene dos casas deterioradas que necesitan ser reparadas,
 un garaje sin techo y sin puertas, un comedor sin techo ni paredes y un
 establo para ganado.
La comunidad Wiwa de Seiamake esta buscando ayuda para hacer realidad dos proyectos muy importantes:

Construcción de la escuela primaria
Construcción de salón comunitario


Current State of the Buildings




The existing buildings of Seiamake are in a
bad state of disrepair due to poor maintenance and theft. The roofs, doors,
windows, sanitary fittings, electricity and water systems are all missing. The
existing structures can be repaired and remodeled to suit the needs of the
primary school and meeting hall. 
Estado actual de las edificaciones

Las edificaciones que 
actualmente existen en Seiamake se encuentran en muy mal estado de 
conservación, debido a la ausencia de mantenimiento y al hurto de sus 
sanitarios, puertas, ventanas. Tampoco cuenta con servicio de 
electricidad ni agua potable. Las
 edificaciones existentes pueden ser reparadas y remodeladas para 
adecuarlas a las necesidades de la escuela primaria y el salón de 
reuniones que se quieren construir.
The Primary School





 
As in every culture, it is important for
children to learn their native language. In Wiwa culture it is important that
the children start their education under the guidance of the adults, who impart
a collective way of seeing the world which helps to build the child's
personality. 


The objective of the primary school is that
the Wiwa children of Seiamake, through Damana, their own language and culture
have a space to learn which complies with a reasonable standard of materials
and building with regard to space, hygiene, ventilation, lighting and comfort.

La escuela primaria

Así como en cada cultura es 
natural que los niños aprendan la lengua materna, entre los Wiwa, es 
necesario que se inicie el proceso de aprendizaje de la mano de los 
adultos, que los lleve a apropiarse de una forma colectiva de ver el 
mundo, y a construir su propia personalidad. La niñez es parte 
fundamental de la cultura Wiwa, ya que
 durante ella se aprende la que será su forma de vida, absorbiendo el 
conocimiento ancestral y prácticas tradicionales, así como su relación 
con la naturaleza, a partir de las cuales se construyen las bases para 
la supervivencia como individuo y comunidad, tratando de garantizar la 
permanencia de sus expresiones culturales.
Con
 este proyecto se busca que los niños de Seiamake realicen el proceso de
 aprendizaje de su lengua Damana y de su cultura tradicional en un lugar
 que respete su entorno propio y que a la vez esté dotado de las mínimas
 condiciones de espacio, higiene, ventilación y comodidad para ellos.



The Meeting Hall





The Wiwa people want this place, Seiamake to
be the centre of their communities and have started to build a traditional
village. The Mamos, the spiritual elders of the Wiwa,
called this place “Seiamake”, which in their native language, Damana, means “the
place of origin”, because they hope the six communities of Gomake, Seiamake,
Coroal, Shebukumake, Parquesito and Casa Aluminio ( a total of 1418
inhabitants) will use this place as the focus of their community.
Salon comunitario para reuniones
El Pueblo Wiwa desea que Seiamake  se convierta en el punto de reunión 
de las seis comunidades Wiwa que habitan en el municipio de Dibulla, 
llamadas Gomake, Seiamake, Coroal,
 Shebukumake, Parquesito y Casa Aluminio, las cuales en total agrupan 
una población de 1.418 indígenas Wiwa. Por esta razón los Mamos, 
autoridades tradicionales de la comunidad, llamaron a este territorio 
“Seiamake”, palabra Damana que significa “lugar donde se retorna a los 
orígenes”.

stuff about my campaign over and over, so I made a list about this 
things that I failed to include in my first video. <br/><br/>PLUS I NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT OUR NEW PERK.<br/><br/>1.- There’s some random Mexican guy in the internet who wants to go to Taiwan. What?<br/>A
 lot of people want to know about the scholarship I got, and who am I. 
Don’t worry I’ll explain. I study Foreign Language Teaching with 
emphasis in Spanish at UNAM one of the biggest universities in the 
world. My yearly tuition is 50cents because it’s a public school and 
that’s why even though I’m kind of broke I can go to collage.<br/>I speak
 Spanish, English, Japanese and Chinese. I am obsessed with asian 
cultures not only because I admire them but also because I think there 
is a lot of ancient wisdom in them that we could use in the western 
world. My scholarship comes from the Taiwanese Embassy in Mexico and it 
will pay for my tuition in Taiwán, housing and food. Just not the plane 
ticket.<br/><br/>2.-¿Why are you broke?<br/>Well first of all I am a 
student, and even though I work teaching Spanish and piano, I spend that
 money on my weekly routine. I live with my parents and they do 
everything they can to support me, but right know they can’t get the 
kind of money I need for this trip.<br/><br/>3.- ¿Why do you speak English and why is your campaign in Canadian dollars?<br/>I
 speak English because in Mexico City they make you study it since 
kindergarten but also because I lived in Canada for almost a year. My 
brother lives there, and I have a lot of friends there.<br/>The campaign 
is in Canadian dollars because I knew from the beginning most of the 
donations would come from Canada. Indiegogo is not that famous in Mexico
 and Mexican people aren’t as used to using their credit or debit cards 
in the internet as Americans or Canadians. That doesn’t mean my Mexican 
friends and family aren’t donating, I am mostly receiving donations in 
cash from them.<br/><br/>4.-¿Music, songs? ¿What is that all about?<br/>So a
 lot of people have gone for the personalised song perk and I’ve noticed
 that’s mainly people that know me personally, So I really need to 
explain to you guys that I am a composer and I play the piano, and 
trumpet and some other instruments as well. If you want to listen to 
some of my music go to <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/don-requena"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/don-requena</a>. The idea 
behind this perk is to gather some information about you and write you 
your own song. By personalised I also mean you can choose what style you
 would like it to be: country, salsa, jazz, pop, metal, etc. So think 
about it, YOUR OWN SONG.<br/><br/>5.-¿What’s this new Perk?<br/>One time my
 brother and I were walking in downtown Winnipeg, when we found an art 
studio and in there we met the most amazing person in the world: Wanda 
Luna. She is not only an artist, curator, writer and community activist 
but also an amazingly loving and supportive friend. If you want to know 
more about go to: <a href=""http://www.wandaluna.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.wandaluna.com/</a><br/>Now, the new perk is no less than one of her awesome pieces of art. So starting today you can get it by donating 510 dollars.<br/><br/>There

For 16 years I was a public school teacher (middle school, high school, and college), and I had the opportunity to work with intelligent, fun, and caring people.  It was a great time! In the summer of 2012 and the summer of 2013 I took two (different) groups of teens on educational trips abroad. While I am not teaching in the classroom anymore, it is still my passion to help teenagers see the world. Travel allows teens access to cultures and sights they've only heard and dreamed about. </div><div><br/></div><div>Research shows that when young people travel, it increases their compassion, confidence, and open-mindedness--these are things we <strong>need</strong> our young people to possess!  My focus is aimed at students who cannot afford to travel on their own, but have the zeal and interest in learning about other cultures and countries.</div><div><br/></div><div>My goal is to raise $60,000 so that I can take 20 deserving teens (who can't afford the trip on their own) on a paid travel excursion in the summer of 2016. Trips run approximately $3000 for two weeks (includes airfare, hotel, and most meals), and the students will be responsible for their own spending money and tip money.</div><div><br/></div><div>Becoming a ""global citizen"" will allow these students the most opportunities in life, and travel is the first step.  This program will rely on donations and funds raised by participants for future participants.  This is the Pay it Forward aspect--students who are selected to travel will have one year to pay an agreed-upon amount to be put toward next year's participants. </div><h3><br/></h3><h3>Here is how your generous donations will be used:</h3><ul>
<li>Trip costs (includes airfare, hotel, some meals, entrance to museums and parks) through EF Tours</li>
<li>Excursion costs when applicable (extra sightseeing or adventure opportunities in countries)</li>
</ul> <div> <h3>Here is what the students must do:</h3> <p> </p>

<h3>Some Previous Students Share their Experiences...</h3>
<div>
<b>Christina LaCasse: </b>Traveling abroad changed me for the better, for sure. I never knew just how small and young we are here in the United States until I went overseas. You walked by the ruins of buildings built in the 1100's over there. Not only that, but I got to see my history books come to life. I got to see the Mona Lisa, not just look at a picture of her in a book. I got to walk the very same steps that Anne Frank did so many years ago. I got to experience history the way it was meant to be experienced - first hand and very close. Traveling abroad is so important for young adults. <b>They can't just be told about these things in history, they need to breathe them, feel them, and experience them for themselves. Only then can they truly learn our world's history.<br/></b>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Conner Chase:</b> Traveling abroad presented me with so many unique opportunities for personal growth. Not only is it exciting and captivating to experience surreal and incredible sights like Notre Dame or the Tower of London with a group of your peers, there are incredibly important educational benefits. Allowing students to experience a world beyond their own creates a sense of intrigue and wonder; this can generate a spark or interest for learning that is omnipresent. For myself, traveling showed the cultural diversity beyond my own small sphere, and getting the opportunity to peer into these other cultures is sometimes like looking into another world. Travel is exhilarating and has bolstered in me a sense of understanding and a lifelong desire for learning. In a sense, one can't really understand what a small world we live in until you experience just how massive it is. What I mean is that as you travel thousands upon thousands of miles, you can compile these factors that make up complete separate cultures and see just how similar they are. Never have I felt more one with myself, my peers, and the world around me than when I was staring at the expanse of the Dutch countryside. All students deserve the invaluable opportunities that I have received regarding travel.

</div></div>","Project OverviewHi! For 16 years I was a public school teacher (middle school, high school, and college), and I had the opportunity to work with intelligent, fun, and caring people.  It was a great time! In the summer of 2012 and the summer of 2013 I took two (different) groups of teens on educational trips abroad. While I am not teaching in the classroom anymore, it is still my passion to help teenagers see the world. Travel allows teens access to cultures and sights they've only heard and dreamed about. Research shows that when young people travel, it increases their compassion, confidence, and open-mindedness--these are things we need our young people to possess!  My focus is aimed at students who cannot afford to travel on their own, but have the zeal and interest in learning about other cultures and countries.My goal is to raise $60,000 so that I can take 20 deserving teens (who can't afford the trip on their own) on a paid travel excursion in the summer of 2016. Trips run approximately $3000 for two weeks (includes airfare, hotel, and most meals), and the students will be responsible for their own spending money and tip money.Becoming a ""global citizen"" will allow these students the most opportunities in life, and travel is the first step.  This program will rely on donations and funds raised by participants for future participants.  This is the Pay it Forward aspect--students who are selected to travel will have one year to pay an agreed-upon amount to be put toward next year's participants. Here is how your generous donations will be used:
Trip costs (includes airfare, hotel, some meals, entrance to museums and parks) through EF Tours
Excursion costs when applicable (extra sightseeing or adventure opportunities in countries)
  Here is what the students must do:  

Cover their personal spending money
Cover tips for all travel and tour guides
Pledge and fulfill a specific amount of money toward next year's travel costs of other students
Get their passports and other travel documents sorted 

Some Previous Students Share their Experiences...

Christina LaCasse: Traveling abroad changed me for the better, for sure. I never knew just how small and young we are here in the United States until I went overseas. You walked by the ruins of buildings built in the 1100's over there. Not only that, but I got to see my history books come to life. I got to see the Mona Lisa, not just look at a picture of her in a book. I got to walk the very same steps that Anne Frank did so many years ago. I got to experience history the way it was meant to be experienced - first hand and very close. Traveling abroad is so important for young adults. They can't just be told about these things in history, they need to breathe them, feel them, and experience them for themselves. Only then can they truly learn our world's history.



Conner Chase: Traveling abroad presented me with so many unique opportunities for personal growth. Not only is it exciting and captivating to experience surreal and incredible sights like Notre Dame or the Tower of London with a group of your peers, there are incredibly important educational benefits. Allowing students to experience a world beyond their own creates a sense of intrigue and wonder; this can generate a spark or interest for learning that is omnipresent. For myself, traveling showed the cultural diversity beyond my own small sphere, and getting the opportunity to peer into these other cultures is sometimes like looking into another world. Travel is exhilarating and has bolstered in me a sense of understanding and a lifelong desire for learning. In a sense, one can't really understand what a small world we live in until you experience just how massive it is. What I mean is that as you travel thousands upon thousands of miles, you can compile these factors that make up complete separate cultures and see just how similar they are. Never have I felt more one with myself, my peers, and the world around me than when I was staring at the expanse of the Dutch countryside. All students deserve the invaluable opportunities that I have received regarding travel. In the end, there is often more to learn outside of the classroom than there is to learn within it. The world is meant to be seen and experienced, especially by growing young minds.

<br/> <p></p>
<p>Our partnership with Uganda’s Kikaaya College and Vocatonal School is one driven by the conviction that every child, no matter where they live on earth is entitled to a high quality education. The idea of equal opportunity in our technologically driven age is not an ideal but a necessity. By providing up to date academic tools and institutional structures we can ensure that the students of Kikaaya College will be able to compete in and contribute to their community. Our relationship with the Kikaaya College and Vocational School is a durable one and we are passionately committed to its students, its faculty and its administration.</p>
<p>After living in Kikaaya and working with its high school students, Nation Foundation director Coby Schoffman became acutely aware of the school’s urgent needs. After compiling a detailed inventory of the necessary resources, the Nation Foundation has a clear goal and a precise budget for actualizing the Kikaaya project.</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Phase 1: Student Tuition</h3>
<p>The tuition at Kikaaya College School and Vocational School is $78.98 per child. Though that sum may seem insignificant to us, in Uganda it can represent a hardship. We would like to raise $27,643 so that each student can enjoy a full scholarship.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436688303/dj99kh48njuh2lleeoyh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h3>Phase 2: Library Reconstruction</h3>
<p>In order to renovate the library at Kikaaya, we need to raise $60,540. With these funds, The Kikaaya College School and Vocational School will have a completely new, expanded and refurbished library large enough to accommodate all of the school’s students at once.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436688328/juw0u5o5kqx1eltqxrgx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h3>Phase 3: Desks, Classrooms, and Textbooks</h3>
<p>$43,875 will purchase for the school 450 new desks, hundreds of vital up to date textbooks, whiteboards, notebooks, pencils and pens. In addition, we will need to refurbish all of the existing classrooms, restoring the infrastructure so that each student can take full advantage of the existing facilities.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<h3>Phase 4: Computers</h3>
<p>For its 700 plus students, The Kikaaya College School has only 9 functioning Windows computers that it acquired in 2002. By raising $56,160 we will be able to purchase and ship 80 new computers with up to date operating systems and software for their new computer lab.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436688596/nnmuxgll4akyylbmfwqi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h3>Phase 5: Vocational School Materials</h3>
<p>The curriculum at Kikaaya’s Vocational School is a vital ingredient that prepares its students for full employment within Ugandan society. In order to ensure that they have equal access and equal opportunity the students must be furnished with all the relevant material. The Electrical Instillation and Electronics Department is in need of a series of tools from safety gloves to bell pushes. For this department we must raise $8,832.72. The Cosmetology Department is in need of all supplies from pressing combs to dressing mirrors. To equip the Cosmetology Department with its needs we need $7,371.39. The Motor Vehicle Department needs pressure pumps, wheel alignment and balancing apparatus, and an entire battery of tools and machinery calling for a total of $47,936.6. The Carpentry Department needs to either purchase or update basic equipment from sanding tools to band saws. This will cost $15,522.7. The Catering and Hotel Management Department needs icing sets, pressure cookers and a whole gamut of culinary necessities totaling at $4,551.24.</p>
<p>The total sum needed for the Kikaaya Vocational School reconstruction is $84,214.65. To find out how to assist by providing raw materials, contact <a href=""mailto:cobyschoffman@thenationfoundation.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cschoffman@nation-foundation</a>.org.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Phase 6: School Bus</h3>
<p>There’s nothing magic about this urgent requirement. As of now the Kikaaya College and Vocational School does not have a school bus. To provide the children with a school bus we must raise a total of $80,000.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>After living and volunteering at the Kikaaya College and Vocational School it is difficult to put in words the level of poverty these students live in. With over half of the students being orphaned, these students live within the schools compounds year round. In cramped conditions with an absence of plumbing (there are no toilets or showers) and electricity, these students exhibit great strength and resilience despite the conditions they live in. Their level of maturity and ability through all of this to remain focused on their studies is truly inspiring. </p>
<p>The students of the Kikaaya College and Vocational School deserve way more then what they have been given. These students  have a work ethic that is indescribable. With school and vocational classes beginning at 6 am and not ending until 9 at night, these students truly define what it means to work hard.</p>
<p>Despite their unbelievable dedication to their studies, a large portion of the students struggle to pay their school fees. Equivicating to less then 80 US dollars a year, what may seem insignificant, represents a tremendous hardship for these students and their families. This is why the first phase of the Kikaaya project is to fund tuition for every student, ensuring that every child has the oppurtunity to complete their high school education. </p>

The idea of equal opportunity in our technologically driven age is not an ideal but a necessity. By providing up to date academic tools and institutional structures we can ensure that the students of Kikaaya College will be able to compete in and contribute to their community. Our relationship with the Kikaaya College and Vocational School is a durable one and we are passionately committed to its students, its faculty and its administration.
After living in Kikaaya and working with its high school students, Nation Foundation director Coby Schoffman became acutely aware of the school’s urgent needs. After compiling a detailed inventory of the necessary resources, the Nation Foundation has a clear goal and a precise budget for actualizing the Kikaaya project.
   What We Need  

Phase 1: Student Tuition
The tuition at Kikaaya College School and Vocational School is $78.98 per child. Though that sum may seem insignificant to us, in Uganda it can represent a hardship. We would like to raise $27,643 so that each student can enjoy a full scholarship.



Phase 2: Library Reconstruction
In order to renovate the library at Kikaaya, we need to raise $60,540. With these funds, The Kikaaya College School and Vocational School will have a completely new, expanded and refurbished library large enough to accommodate all of the school’s students at once.



Phase 3: Desks, Classrooms, and Textbooks
$43,875 will purchase for the school 450 new desks, hundreds of vital up to date textbooks, whiteboards, notebooks, pencils and pens. In addition, we will need to refurbish all of the existing classrooms, restoring the infrastructure so that each student can take full advantage of the existing facilities.



Phase 4: Computers
For its 700 plus students, The Kikaaya College School has only 9 functioning Windows computers that it acquired in 2002. By raising $56,160 we will be able to purchase and ship 80 new computers with up to date operating systems and software for their new computer lab.



Phase 5: Vocational School Materials
The curriculum at Kikaaya’s Vocational School is a vital ingredient that prepares its students for full employment within Ugandan society. In order to ensure that they have equal access and equal opportunity the students must be furnished with all the relevant material. The Electrical Instillation and Electronics Department is in need of a series of tools from safety gloves to bell pushes. For this department we must raise $8,832.72. The Cosmetology Department is in need of all supplies from pressing combs to dressing mirrors. To equip the Cosmetology Department with its needs we need $7,371.39. The Motor Vehicle Department needs pressure pumps, wheel alignment and balancing apparatus, and an entire battery of tools and machinery calling for a total of $47,936.6. The Carpentry Department needs to either purchase or update basic equipment from sanding tools to band saws. This will cost $15,522.7. The Catering and Hotel Management Department needs icing sets, pressure cookers and a whole gamut of culinary necessities totaling at $4,551.24.
The total sum needed for the Kikaaya Vocational School reconstruction is $84,214.65. To find out how to assist by providing raw materials, contact cschoffman@nation-foundation.org.



Phase 6: School Bus
There’s nothing magic about this urgent requirement. As of now the Kikaaya College and Vocational School does not have a school bus. To provide the children with a school bus we must raise a total of $80,000.



    Perks

With a donation of $150 you will receive a one of a kind Kikaaya soccer or basketball jersey. We have personally designed these jerseys for the students of the Kikaaya High School. 








The Impact After living and volunteering at the Kikaaya College and Vocational School it is difficult to put in words the level of poverty these students live in. With over half of the students being orphaned, these students live within the schools compounds year round. In cramped conditions with an absence of plumbing (there are no toilets or showers) and electricity, these students exhibit great strength and resilience despite the conditions they live in. Their level of maturity and ability through all of this to remain focused on their studies is truly inspiring. 
The students of the Kikaaya College and Vocational School deserve way more then what they have been given. These students  have a work ethic that is indescribable. With school and vocational classes beginning at 6 am and not ending until 9 at night, these students truly define what it means to work hard.
Despite their unbelievable dedication to their studies, a large portion of the students struggle to pay their school fees. Equivicating to less then 80 US dollars a year, what may seem insignificant, represents a tremendous hardship for these students and their families. This is why the first phase of the Kikaaya project is to fund tuition for every student, ensuring that every child has the oppurtunity to complete their high school education. 




Our Mission
The Nation Foundation is an organization that provides schools in impoverished and developing countries with a series of essential scholastic resources that will ensure all students, regardless of their circumstances, have access to equal academic opportunities.

Our Vision
Our vision at The Nation Foundation is to select one school in a different part of the developing world each year and help provide the principal materials and critical infrastructure necessary for a quality education.


    Other Ways You Can Help



Sponsor a Child
A donation of $80 dollars will help pay a student’s registration, tuition and board fees for one full year as well as provide for all their necessary academic materials.
Volunteer
We offer a variety of ways in which one can volunteer. Each year The Nation Foundation selects a small group of volunteers to work in one of our project schools throughout the developing world. We also offer a wide range of domestic volunteer programs where you can make a real difference within your own community.
Set Up a Drive
Mobilize your friends and neighbors by sponsoring your own fund drive! If you would like to open up your home, your community center, your school, work or house of worship to raise money to provide vital educational tools like computers, electronics, academic material, sports equipment and more, please contact us for details.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>
<p></p>
<div>After sharing this design and the results of our programs in UNHCR refugee camps at exhibitions and conferences, we were asked by members of various communities around the world to develop Ideas Box programs in their home contexts. Today, we have developed Ideas Box programs in 6 countries, from aboriginal communities in the Torres Straights of Australia to the public squares of Paris, France.<br/>
</div>
<div>The program was originally conceived of as a way to expand access to educational materials in humanitarian crises contexts. The box being launched in Hayden Lord Park in the South Bronx marks an evolution in this concept as we recognized the need for access to these tools is universal and extends even to communities located in the middle of some of the most connected places in the world. The Ideas Box opening in Hayden Lord Park will foster enhanced educational opportunities, providing students tools and workshops to continue learning beyond the classroom.<br/>

Project Goals

Fostering Creativity



The Ideas Box is not just a toolkit. Libraries Without Borders trains facilitators and designs workshops. For example, in the Bronx, we'll be leading students through documentary filmmaking workshops, using video cameras from the Ideas Box to record footage of activities in the park, then using computers and tablets pre-installed with video editing software in the Ideas Box to edit the footage, and using the Internet provided by the Ideas Box to upload and share these videos.
Four or more trained facilitators will be on site at all times to guide users through how to use different pre-loaded applications, from Photoshop to Caustic (a DJing app) and 123D Sculpt+ (a 3D modeling app).


Expanding Access to Educational Tools




In partnership with local libraries and schools, Libraries Without Borders has curated and pre-loaded the Ideas Box with educational content that complements and supplements ongoing educational programs in the community.
The Ideas Box stays open when schools close — in the evening, on the weekend, and during summer vacation. 







Creating a New Collaborative Public Space




All are welcome: The Libraries Without Borders team conducts outreach throughout the community to invite individuals of different ages, genders, and ethnic backgrounds.
Collaboration across different organizations: The Libraries Without Borders team builds partnerships across local, national, and international organizations of private, public, and non-profit sectors. For example, in preparation for this project in the Bronx, Libraries Without Borders has developed partnerships with DreamYard, The New York Public Library, the International Rescue Committee, Bronx Pro, and Codecademy.










About the Ideas Box




The Ideas Box was developed in an international humanitarian context via partnerships with French designer Philippe Starck and the UNHCR. Libraries Without Borders first deployed the Ideas Box to refugee camps in Burundi, where it has been for over a year, already registering more than 30,000 visits, inspiring a camp-wide newspaper, and leading to a refugee-produced film that premiered at the International Human Rights Film Festival. Read a longer review of our project in the World Policy Journal.


After sharing this design and the results of our programs in UNHCR refugee camps at exhibitions and conferences, we were asked by members of various communities around the world to develop Ideas Box programs in their home contexts. Today, we have developed Ideas Box programs in 6 countries, from aboriginal communities in the Torres Straights of Australia to the public squares of Paris, France.

Where Does the Money Go?
The $60,000 covers all costs associated with the construction of the Ideas Box and the purchase of all contents inside.

New Territory: Challenges in the U.S.


As a team of Americans, we are interested in pulling our experiences from international development back home to our communities in the US. Because this is our first project in the U.S., we anticipate hurdles we didn’t face abroad:


Challenges:

Engaging a diverse range of users from the local community
Ensuring that the Ideas Box supplements and complements ongoing community programs

How we will face them:
Our challenges are in line with our goals. Libraries Without Borders has been working closely with DreamYard and the local Sedgwick branch of The New York Public Library, organizations that have worked with families in the South Bronx community for over two decades. Together, we have been customizing all content, training facilitators, designing workshops built specifically for individuals and families in the South Bronx, and conducting outreach through low-income housing communities and public schools.

<h3>What is this course about?</h3> <p></p>
<p>The African research scene is improving. Year on year the number of papers produced by, or in collaboration with, African scientists is increasing – from 1996 to 2012 the number of research papers published in scientific journals with at least one African author more than <a href=""http://planetearthinstitute.org.uk/what-are-the-barriers-to-scientific-independence-in-africa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">quadrupled</a>.</p>
<p></p>However, much research remains unpublished for instance in institutional journals or published in regional journals that are not yet indexed in international journal databases. The major problem is not that research from Africa is not produced in significant quantity but that it is not always being recognised at the level is it due.<p></p>TReND in Africa believe that <b>true sustainable development can only come through investment in higher education and scientific innovation</b>. We run a wide range of educational activities making use of latest technologies and developments, ranging from open source software and hardware approaches such as 3D printing to online teaching tools. </div><div>

<p><a href=""http://trendinafrica.org/activities/education/science-writing-and-communication-courses/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A workshop in Science Writing and Communication</a> contributes to scientific development in its overarching training goal - to improve scientific literacy and access to internationally recognised journals and to improve the standards of African journals. Hosted by <b>Chancellor College, University of Malawi</b> in Zomba, the six day course from <b>7th to the 12th September</b> will train participants in all aspects of communication in science - from effectively searching the literature to review the field, planning and writing
manuscripts targeted to appropriate journals and responding to reviewers, to
giving talks, not only to peers in an academic setting, but also in public and
with non specialist audiences so that scientists can share their work with the
wider society. We will encourage the participants to embrace the role social media can play in their science, guiding them in a truly 21st century approach to scientific research.</p> </div> <div>
<h3>What we need and how you can help</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>A contribution to this course will go a long way to supporting early career researchers from all over Africa progress in their contribution to African innovation and research. </p>

<h5>Firstly, what is free:</h5>As usual for TReND courses, attendance is free of charge and the instructors offer their time on a volunteer basis. The host institution, Chancellor College are providing classrooms free of charge. <p></p>

<h5>Secondly, what funds are required for:</h5>Teaching materials such as flip charts and printing costs, accommodation, travel and refreshments for participants and instructors.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h5>The budget</h5>
<p>We are operating a
tiered budget which provides different services dependent on funding received.
The lower budget for the course is £1,750, which includes accommodation, food
and transport for two instructors (one international and one local), day
refreshments for 25 students and 2 instructors, printing of materials and
internet costs. With more funding the budget can expand to £3,500: this will
include accommodation and food for the 25 students in addition to the
instructors. An upper tier budget of £6,000 allows for two further international
instructors, who will add their expertise from senior research positions.</p>
<h3>The impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The primary impact will be on the participants: early-career researchers from all over Africa. We hope
that the skills learnt in the workshop will be taken back to the participants’
universities, for example when they read and review their colleagues’
manuscripts or make comments during presentations. In hosting, Chancellor College will benefit indirectly as
attendees mix with Chancellor College staff, allowing the exchange of ideas
over the refreshment breaks as at many international science conferences. As
part of the interactive side of the workshop, we hope to have the attendees practice their skills learnt in a special departmental series of short talks, to which staff will be invited. The staff will be indirect beneficiaries of the workshop as the attendees present the research using skills learnt.</p>
<p>TReND has 5 years of experience in organising workshops like these - between
2010 and 2014, more than 100 African students took part in TReND programmes in
fields such as molecular biology, bioinformatics and neuroscience, using
open-source hardware and software. As the primary facilitator, I bring over 7 years of experience in scientific research and communication, with experience in television, museums and the laboratory. Additional facilitators bring further experience in similar fields.</p>

<p>The efforts of TReND are already starting to bear fruit. A 2012 TReND alumnus was selected to attend the Wellcome Trust funded and highly competitive course <a href=""http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Education-resources/Courses-and-conferences/Advanced-Courses-and-Scientific-Conferences/Advanced-Courses/WTX060194.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Computational Molecular Evolution</a> at Cambridge, UK; two 2011 TReND alumni attended the <a href=""http://www.ibro.org/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=5558"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">interregional IBRO school on Computational Neuroscience</a> in Hyderabad, India; a further 2011 TReND alumnus worked as a lecturer at Mekelle University (Addis, Ethiopia) and is now pursuing a PhD at the University of Kwazulu-Natal (South Africa) on memory and epilepsy using Drosophila as a model system.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What's the risk?</h3> <p>This is a new course, on a topic that has not yet been addressed by TReND in Africa. As with any new course that is a risk. There is a risk that the interest will be low, but previous courses have been oversubscribed in their first year, and TReND's offerings of workshops and courses has only grown to meet demand. TReND now offers workshops in five areas and has a network of 40 volunteers from Switzerland to Uganda. </p>
<p>Low funding is also a risk. Though this workshop is low budget in comparison to many scientific workshops, funds are still required for it to go ahead. To reduce the risk of cancellation in the case of insufficient funds, we are operating a tiered budget, where the programme will adjust to meet the level of funding. </p>
<p>No-show is also a risk - a particular risk to a free-to-attend, international workshop like this. This was a problem in 2012, when three students did not arrive. In response, TReND increased the stringency for selection, only choosing applicants who demonstrate a strong commitment to attending and blacklisting no-shows. This eliminated no-shows and improved the caliber of participant.</p>

</div></div>","Who are we?
TReND in Africa - an international charity for sustainable development through higher education and scientific innovation.
Andrew - a scientist living in rural Mozambique with a love of teaching, writing and presenting, and a volunteer for TReND.
What is this course about? 
The African research scene is improving. Year on year the number of papers produced by, or in collaboration with, African scientists is increasing – from 1996 to 2012 the number of research papers published in scientific journals with at least one African author more than quadrupled.
However, much research remains unpublished for instance in institutional journals or published in regional journals that are not yet indexed in international journal databases. The major problem is not that research from Africa is not produced in significant quantity but that it is not always being recognised at the level is it due.TReND in Africa believe that true sustainable development can only come through investment in higher education and scientific innovation. We run a wide range of educational activities making use of latest technologies and developments, ranging from open source software and hardware approaches such as 3D printing to online teaching tools. 


A workshop in Science Writing and Communication contributes to scientific development in its overarching training goal - to improve scientific literacy and access to internationally recognised journals and to improve the standards of African journals. Hosted by Chancellor College, University of Malawi in Zomba, the six day course from 7th to the 12th September will train participants in all aspects of communication in science - from effectively searching the literature to review the field, planning and writing
manuscripts targeted to appropriate journals and responding to reviewers, to
giving talks, not only to peers in an academic setting, but also in public and
with non specialist audiences so that scientists can share their work with the
wider society. We will encourage the participants to embrace the role social media can play in their science, guiding them in a truly 21st century approach to scientific research.  
What we need and how you can help 

A contribution to this course will go a long way to supporting early career researchers from all over Africa progress in their contribution to African innovation and research. 

Firstly, what is free:As usual for TReND courses, attendance is free of charge and the instructors offer their time on a volunteer basis. The host institution, Chancellor College are providing classrooms free of charge. 

Secondly, what funds are required for:Teaching materials such as flip charts and printing costs, accommodation, travel and refreshments for participants and instructors.

</div>Our goal is to create educational Multi-Media, videos and Apps, to help deaf Muslims learn about their religion. Muslims in this age of technology have thousands of videos from famous scholars and Apps available to help them to learn about Islam. Deaf Muslims feel left out, neglected and forgotten because they cannot find Islamic videos produced with American Sign Language (ASL). Please help us produce stories and lectures in ASL so deaf Muslims and deaf non-Muslims can learn about our beautiful way of life. <br/>Our first project is called Stories of the Prophets. These stories will be available on video, through an App, and via eBook. They will teach about the strong faith, exemplary lives, and excellent character of these amazing men who walked this earth. The App will be interactive, breaking down the signs for Islamic terms and ayat from the Quran. We have an excellent team of scholars, writers, interpreters, film producers, illustrators, animators, App developers, and most of all our host Rebecca Hossain who is deaf and will be signing in these productions. <br/>Our second project will be to add ASL to existing video lectures of one of our beloved local scholars, Shaikh Omar Suleiman. This will allow us to help the deaf community benefit from his teachings, so that they can increase their understanding of Islam and raise their level of Iman, Inshallah. <br/>Each episode of Stories of the Prophets will cost $10,000 and adding ASL to each 30 min Lecture will cost $5000. This cost will go toward studio rental, filming, editing, illustration, animation, script writing, host, interpreters, DVD duplication, and App/eBook development. Please help us accomplish this goal.

<p>German translation see below / Deutsche Übersetzung siehe unten<br/></p><h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Kanyala Little Stars Academy was founded in the early 2000s
by Benter Odhiambo, who saw the effect of HIV/AIDS epidemic was having on her
community and on the children, and decided that something needed to be done to
ensure the children were still able to be educated. As a retired teacher
herself, Benter decided to start a school for the orphans and vulnerable
children of her surroundings. On Rusinga Island where the School is located she
is only known as the warm hearted Mama Benter. Unfortunately she died in 2013.
But Samwel Asingo Odhiambo and his motivated team is continuing the great idea
of Mama Benter.</p>
<p><i>About the Word Kanyala:<br/>
It means ‘WE CAN’ in Dholou, the native language of the people in this part of
Kenya.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439099223/rtak0qjpyivybobjitkx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439097773/fuvrtpuxjwqektxpg7al.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 617.898px; height: 294px;""/><h3><br/></h3><h3>Where we are

</h3><p>Kanyala Little Stars Academy is located on beautiful Rusinga
Island in western Kenya. Lake Victoria and many Mountains are shaping the
countryside. The students are coming from the next town on the mainland, called
Mbita and all around Rusinga Island. Some of them are walking up to one hour to
school.</p>
<h3>Our progress during the last 14 years</h3>
<p>Since founding the number of students increased continuously
because of many child-headed families in Kenya. Today the primary has also a
nursery and preschool class. In all there are more than 300 children coming day
by day to school. They really appreciate the opportunity of getting education!
The school facilities were expanded and improved several times. Now we can
dispose of some bricked classrooms with light for the evening. During the short
history of our organization we could assemble a successful team of teachers and
other staff which guarantees a high quality of teaching. The reputation of
Little Stars Academy is very good. </p>
<p>Kanyala Little Stars is now a manifold organization. We
promote and provide humanitarian support, technical assistance and emergency
relief to disadvantaged people through the school, horticulture farm, a small
bread bakery and a seedling nursery. The goal is to promote holistic community
development through education and sustainable agriculture. Our organization is
comprised of youth, women, widows, orphans and vulnerable children.</p><p></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439097871/agcb5qcn5peyegm3u1ok.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The major reasons why Mama Benter founded Little Stars
Organization were the variety of challenges around. Although fishing in Lake
Victoria is giving many people an income, poverty is ever-present. A huge
amount of people is still living on less than one dollar a day. You can
imagine: without money, health is a problem too. The whole county is suffering
on diseases like cholera, malaria and HIV. The best response on this is
education. But it must be available at affordable costs. Little Stars Academy
is a private school which is not supported by the government. The school is
funded by school fees and sponsors. Poor families are supported by the
community.</p>
<p>We try to give as many children as possible a chance of
education. But in fact we cannot consider all the admission request because of limited
space. </p>
<h3>
<span><span></span></span>The old Kitchen </h3>
<p>About half of the pupils do not go home during lunch break.
They have a meal at school. It is a daily challenge to prepare 160 meals. The
kitchen is still a part of the first build houses. It’s not bricked; it’s made
out of iron sheets which can be seen so often in Kenya. We are using Africans
most common cooking method – which is cooking on fire with collected firewood.
The main problem with this is the smoke. The work for the kitchen staff is not
easy because of irritated eyes and difficulty breathing. Often smoke is going
into some classrooms and is disturbing the lessons.</p>
<p>Due to the simple construction of the building it is not
possible to guarantee a hygienic environment which should be sure for preparing
meals for our pupils. Proper cleaning of the sooty walls and the uneven floor
is almost impossible. We want to change the bad conditions.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439097948/nq7aaj2rbxiomeilykcw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439097969/ncpqmyqavlrrrspugwwe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439098000/dv7fephg4lljlf9sju0z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Our idea</h3>
<p>For now it is our most important task to renew the room and

<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Bricked building with lockable door and two
windows</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Metal sheet roof</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Solid and adequate two burner stove for large
pots (each 100 litres)</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Chimney to bring the smoke outwards</p>
<p><span>·<span>

</p><h3>Wer wir sind</h3>
<p>Die Kanyala
Little Stars Academy wurde in den frühen 2000er Jahren von Frau Benter Odhiambo
gegründet. Sie wollte den gravierenden Auswirkungen der herrschenden HIV/AIDS
Epidemie in ihrer Gemeinde etwas entgegen setzten. Vor allem die vielen
Waisenkinder litten sehr unter der Situation und konnten nicht zur Schule gehen. Frau Odhiambo
gründete die Grundschule als pensionierte Lehrerin. Auf der Insel Rusinga, wo
die Schule liegt war sie besser bekannt als die warmherzige Mama Benter. Leider
starb sie im Jahr 2013. Aber ihre Söhne, vor allem Samwel Asingo Odhiambo und
sein engagiertes Team setzen die großartige Idee von Mama Benter weiter fort. </p>
<p><i>Über das Wort Kanyala:<br/>
Es ist Dholou, die Muttersprache der Menschen in dieser Gegend Kenias und
bedeutet „Wir können“.</i></p>
<h3>Wo wir sind</h3>
<p>Die Kanyala
Little Stars Academy liegt auf der landschaftlich sehr schönen Insel Rusinga,
im Westen von Kenia. Der Viktoriasee und viele Berge prägen die Landschaft. Die
Schüler kommen aus dem direkten Umfeld der naheliegenden Stadt Mbita und von
der ganzen Insel. Manche von ihnen gehen täglich eine Stunde zur Schule.</p>
<h3>Unser Fortschritt in den letzten
14 Jahren</h3>
<p>Seit der Gründung
ist die Anzahl der Schüler kontinuierlich gestiegen. Viele Familien sind sehr kinderreich. Heute hat die Grundschule auch eine Kindergartengruppe und eine
Vorschulklasse. Insgesamt kommen jeden Tag mehr als 300 Kinder zur Schule.
Sie genießen die Möglichkeit Bildung zu erhalten. Das Schulgebäude wurde
mehrmals erweitert und verbessert. Jetzt gibt es sogar einige gemauerte
Klassenräume mit Licht für die Abendstunden. Innerhalb der überschaubaren
Geschichte der Schule konnte ein erfolgreiches Team von Lehrern und anderen
Bediensteten zusammengestellt werden, die eine hohe Qualität von Unterricht
ermöglichen. Die Reputation der Little Stars Academy ist sehr gut.</p>
<p>Die Schule ist
Teil einer vielfältigen Organisation. Die Little Stars Organisation unterstützt
bedürftige Menschen, bietet technische Hilfe und Erleichterungen für
notleidende oder benachteiligte Personen. Dies geschieht durch die Schule, eine
Farm, eine kleine Bäckerei, und eine Pflanzenzucht. Das Ziel ist es umfangreiche
Verbesserungen durch die Vermittlung von Bildung und der Landwirtschaft
voranzutreiben. Die Organisation richtet sich an die Jugend, Frauen, Witwen,
Waisen und benachteiligte Kinder. </p>
<h3>Herausforderungen</h3>
<p>Der herausragende
Grund, warum Mama Benter die Little Stars Organisation gründete waren die
vielfältigen Probleme in der Gegend. Obwohl die Fischerei im Viktoriasee vielen
Menschen ein Einkommen gibt ist Armut allgegenwärtig. Ein großer Teil der
Bevölkerung lebt von unter einem Dollar am Tag. Man kann sich vorstellen, ohne
Geld ist die Gesundheit ebenso ein großes Problem. Die ganze Provinz leidet
immer wieder unter Ausbrüchen von Krankheiten wie Cholera oder Malaria. Und HIV
ist nach wie vor sehr weit verbreitet. Was man dem entgegensetzten kann?
Bildung! Aber diese Bildung muss zu erschwinglichen Preisen verfügbar sein. Die
Little Stars Academy ist eine private Schule die nicht von der Regierung
unterstütz wird. Die Schule finanziert sich durch Schulgebühren und Spenden.
Arme Familien werden unterstützt.</p>
<p>Wir versuchen so
vielen Kindern wie möglich die Chance von Bildung zu ermöglichen. Aber leider
können aufgrund der begrenzten Kapazität nicht alle Kinder aufgenommen werden.</p>
<h3>
<span><span></span></span>Die
alte Küche</h3>
<p>Ungefähr die Hälfte
der Kinder essen in der Mittagspause nicht zu Hause. Sie bekommen eine Mahlzeit
in der Schule. Es ist eine tägliche Herausforderung die 160 Portionen
zuzubereiten. Die Küche ist noch ein Teil der zuerst errichteten Gebäude. Sie ist
nicht gemauert, sondern aus dem in Afrika allgegenwärtigem Wellblech gebaut.
Wir nutzen die vorherrschende Kochmethode, das Kochen mit offenem Feuer und
gesammeltem Holz. Das größte Problem damit ist der entstehende Rauch. Die
Arbeit für das Küchenteam ist oft schwierig wegen brennender Augen und
erschwerter Atmung. Oft zieht der Rauch auch in naheliegende Klassenzimmer und
stört den Unterricht.</p>
<p>Aufgrund der
einfachen Konstruktion des Gebäudes ist es nicht möglich eine hygienische
Umgebung zu schaffen, die eigentlich selbstverständlich sein sollte um
Mahlzeiten für die Kinder zuzubereiten. Eine gründliche Reinigung der rußigen
Wände ist fast unmöglich. Wir wollen diesen Zustand ändern.</p>
<h3>
<span><span></span></span>Unsere Idee</h3>
<p>Gegenwärtig ist
es unsere wichtigste Aufgabe die Küche zu erneuern, so dass sie den Namen Küche
verdient. Was wir machen möchten:</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Erneuern der Küche durch lokale Handwerker</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Ein gemauertes Gebäude mit abschließbarer
Tür und zwei Fenstern.</p>
<p><span>·<span>  Ein </span></span>Metalldach</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Anschaffung eines soliden Herdes für zwei
große Töpfe (je 100 Liter)</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Ein Schornstein für den entstehenden Rauch</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Eine leicht zu reinigende Arbeitsumgebung</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Ein Becken um das Geschirr zu waschen</p>
<h3>Sie können uns helfen</h3>
<p>Wir von der
Little Stars Academy versuchen täglich so vielen Familien wie möglich zu
helfen, indem wir ihre Kinder unterrichten. Aber jetzt brauchen wir Hilfe. Die
Hilfe von Menschen aus verschiedensten Ländern – die unsere Arbeit schätzen.
Mit dieser Kampagne ist es einfach für Sie uns zu helfen. Wir hoffen die
nötige Erneuerung der Küche – die 4.000 $ kosten wird – in den nächsten drei
Monaten realisieren zu können. Wir werden über alle Fortschritte berichten. Wir
würden uns freuen auch einmal Unterstützer vor Ort kennen zu lernen!</p>

</div>","German translation see below / Deutsche Übersetzung siehe untenWho we are
Kanyala Little Stars Academy was founded in the early 2000s
by Benter Odhiambo, who saw the effect of HIV/AIDS epidemic was having on her
community and on the children, and decided that something needed to be done to
ensure the children were still able to be educated. As a retired teacher
herself, Benter decided to start a school for the orphans and vulnerable
children of her surroundings. On Rusinga Island where the School is located she
is only known as the warm hearted Mama Benter. Unfortunately she died in 2013.
But Samwel Asingo Odhiambo and his motivated team is continuing the great idea
of Mama Benter.
About the Word Kanyala:
It means ‘WE CAN’ in Dholou, the native language of the people in this part of
Kenya.Where we are

Kanyala Little Stars Academy is located on beautiful Rusinga
Island in western Kenya. Lake Victoria and many Mountains are shaping the
countryside. The students are coming from the next town on the mainland, called
Mbita and all around Rusinga Island. Some of them are walking up to one hour to
school.
Our progress during the last 14 years
Since founding the number of students increased continuously
because of many child-headed families in Kenya. Today the primary has also a
nursery and preschool class. In all there are more than 300 children coming day
by day to school. They really appreciate the opportunity of getting education!
The school facilities were expanded and improved several times. Now we can
dispose of some bricked classrooms with light for the evening. During the short
history of our organization we could assemble a successful team of teachers and
other staff which guarantees a high quality of teaching. The reputation of
Little Stars Academy is very good. 
Kanyala Little Stars is now a manifold organization. We
promote and provide humanitarian support, technical assistance and emergency
relief to disadvantaged people through the school, horticulture farm, a small
bread bakery and a seedling nursery. The goal is to promote holistic community
development through education and sustainable agriculture. Our organization is
comprised of youth, women, widows, orphans and vulnerable children.Challenges
The major reasons why Mama Benter founded Little Stars
Organization were the variety of challenges around. Although fishing in Lake
Victoria is giving many people an income, poverty is ever-present. A huge
amount of people is still living on less than one dollar a day. You can
imagine: without money, health is a problem too. The whole county is suffering
on diseases like cholera, malaria and HIV. The best response on this is
education. But it must be available at affordable costs. Little Stars Academy
is a private school which is not supported by the government. The school is
funded by school fees and sponsors. Poor families are supported by the
community.
We try to give as many children as possible a chance of
education. But in fact we cannot consider all the admission request because of limited
space. 

The old Kitchen 
About half of the pupils do not go home during lunch break.
They have a meal at school. It is a daily challenge to prepare 160 meals. The
kitchen is still a part of the first build houses. It’s not bricked; it’s made
out of iron sheets which can be seen so often in Kenya. We are using Africans
most common cooking method – which is cooking on fire with collected firewood.
The main problem with this is the smoke. The work for the kitchen staff is not
easy because of irritated eyes and difficulty breathing. Often smoke is going
into some classrooms and is disturbing the lessons.
Due to the simple construction of the building it is not
possible to guarantee a hygienic environment which should be sure for preparing
meals for our pupils. Proper cleaning of the sooty walls and the uneven floor
is almost impossible. We want to change the bad conditions.Our idea
For now it is our most important task to renew the room and
create a kitchen which deserves the name kitchen. What we want to do: 
· 
Renew the kitchen by local contractors
· 
Bricked building with lockable door and two
windows
· 
Metal sheet roof
· 
Solid and adequate two burner stove for large
pots (each 100 litres)
· 
Chimney to bring the smoke outwards
· 
Easy to clean and stable work surface / floor
· 
Basin for washing the dishes
You can help us
We at Little Stars Academy try to help as many families as
possible, giving their children education. But now we need help - the help of
people around the world who appreciates our work. With this crowdfunding
campaign it’s easy for you to support us. We hope to realize the essential
renovation which costs $ 4.000 all in price during the next three month. We

Was passiert, wenn nicht der gesamte Betrag
gespendet wird?
Der Herd mit
Rauchabzug (ca. 1.100 $) ist unser größtes Anliegen. Wenn nicht genügend Geld
für ein gemauertes Gebäude gespendet wird möchten wir die Küche so gut es geht
verbessern um sie hygienischer zu machen. Das gespendete Geld wird in jedem
Falle in die Küche investiert!
Sie können uns nicht helfen?
Das ist kein
Problem, aber Sie können uns dennoch unterstützten. Bitte helfen Sie uns diese
Kampagne zu verbreiten und sprechen Sie mit Freunden darüber. Es wäre großartig

<p>We are
pioneering an adventurous educational curriculum for our kids that will span 15
years and 100 countries. Best of all: <b>it’s FREE</b>. Each family member
has the freedom to choose what they want to learn – following their curiosity,
interests, and goals.</p>

<p>We will
be living all over the world, and settle for about one year in each region, so we can learn different cultures, geography, languages, writing, architecture, customs, ecosystems, climate,
 traditions, art, economics, politics, industry, trade, human
relationships, sports, entertainment. The goal is to teach our children the
value of tolerance and mutual respect, and to do our part to build a fair and
inclusive world that embraces diversity. Everyone deserves to receive a quality
education and to learn the values that will help them become members of the
global community.</p>

<p><b>THE FAMILY</b></p>
<p>The value of the family is at the heart of this project. We get involved very deep in the education of our children, because we share the same experiences; for that reason, we  play  two leading roles, as teachers and as facilitators of resources for each child to achieve their goals. Our task is to encourage in every experience, the practice of perseverance, joy, order and truth to the family and society. We want to grow, learn, explore and discover the world with our children, be best friends to guide them with love, freedom and respect, until
they are ready to be independent.</p>
<p><b>TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
<p>Technology plays an important role
today because it is an efficient way to learn about free and fun way; Also,
through the digital world, we can access all kinds of information, courses,
tutorials, applications, games etc. immediately, with an incredible amount
of possibilities, therefore, it is necessary to develop skills to make the
best decisions to their immediate welfare and educational resource.</p>
<p><b>PROFESSIONAL  EDUCATION</b></p>
<p>Children coming out from non traditional
school systems have the opportunity to join various universities, where a
formal certificate is not required, only the commitment and desire to learn,
like <a href=""http://www.open.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Open University</a><a href=""http://www.open.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.open.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a> of London.</p>
<p><b>MISSION</b></p>
<p>Honor and trust in the skills and passions of each individual that encourages them to explore, discover and develop their own talents, skills, and goals; through the practice of a responsible and respectful of the needs of children at different stages of human development, enabling them to live in harmony with nature and the world fatherhood.</p>
<p><b> GOALS.</b><br/></p>
<p>• Promote the development of children through the senses in close contact with nature and their immediate social environment.</p>
<p>• Foster meaningful learning through the experiences of daily life in the different contexts in which they unfold.</p>
<p>• Being happy, creative, enterprising beings with broad vision and competent with themselves and society.</p>
<p>• Training multicultural and cosmopolitan beings who understand the diversity.</p>
<p>• Learn languages.</p>
<p>• Learn to use cutting-edge technology and tools so as to enable them to achieve their personal goals and contribute to the community.</p>
<p>• Create a comprehensive replicable model for other families to share this experience and make significant contributions to existing educational models.</p>
<p>• Combine the spiritual and educational development to integrate it into their daily lives that allows them to be better citizens of the world and caretakers of this planet.</p>
<p>• To live an experience of self-reflection to discover in the world around them and make their contributions to society.</p>
<p><b>• Create a system of grants so that other families can experience this adventure.</b><br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>A DOCUMENTARY OF LIFE</b></p>
<p>We
are launching this campaign to raise funds for a documentary that will follow
the experiences and behavior of four children at different stages of development, where values are fostered: love, respect, responsibility to enable them to exercise their freedom in decisions according to their interests.</p>
<p>The duration of the documentary will be for 15 years, until the children reach adulthood.</p>
<p><b>Methodology:</b></p>
<p>Biannual campaigns conducted by geographic region, and at the end of each semester a documentary where you will see a compilation of learning, development and growth that has taken the family through the various experiences will occur.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’ll also transmit our experiences and adventures on  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChtkRWHqwlHKt7yz9wTBvcw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">YouTube channel</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>

<p>The first semi-annual campaign begins in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in January 2016.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This past
year we have been touring around Mexico funded by our own resources and with
the support of over 50 sponsors. During this journey, we have spent time with
several artisan communities and we are interested in working with them and
contribute to their economic, cultural and social development. That is why some
of the perks we offer are Mexican handcrafts.</p>

<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p>We
used to have a fairly traditional lifestyle. But when we had kids, our own
interest in education was reawakened because we know that is the most important contribution that  as parents we can do for their future. And it had to be an education where they will provide academic knowledge, culture, science and the development of life skills, love and respect for nature, from which to become responsible citizens and caring for their environment. </p>
<p>In
seeking for the best education for our children, we tried different systems,
such as Montessori, Constructivist and British.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We even
opened our own alternative school with friends and family called ""LA
BELLA VERDE"", but we closed it after a year because we moved to Tulum, Mexico
where we joined families from around the world (Mexico, Argentina, Spain,
France, Russia, Cuba, England) and together formed an ecological and
multicultural school called ""COMUNIDAD DE APRENDIZAJE AMANECER"".</p>

We conclude that our children were not interested in learning in a classroom (they said it was very boring). After long talks, much research and mainly listen to children, we find the  Unschooling philosophy <span style=""background-color: initial;"">(<a href=""http://www.johnholtgws.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">learn more</a>), and held  for 2 years.</span>

<p>It was then that we decided to implement this travel philosophy and begin our adventure.</p>
<p>We left everything behind. Home, family, work, friends and lifestyle. This journey has been achieved with very limited financial resources, we have been able to continue with this project thanks to the support of the great people who believe in our learning model.</p>

<p><b>CIUDADANOS DEL MUNDO</b></p>
<p>El proyecto  consiste en vivir en diferentes lugares del mundo y establecernos aproximadamente un año en cada lugar, ya que así podemos conocer
de cada región, el idioma, escritura, arquitectura, flora, fauna, clima,
cultura, tradiciones, arte, economía, política, industria, comercio, relaciones
humanas, deportes, entretenimiento etc.; para enseñar a nuestros hijos el valor de la tolerancia y el respeto mutuo, y con ello construir un mundo más justo e inclusivo que abarque la diversidad. Todos tenemos derecho a recibir una educación de calidad basada en valores como: la paz, la tolerancia, la igualdad, el compañerismo y la solidaridad por mencionar algunos valores básicos y necesarios a partir de los cuales aprendamos a vernos a nosotros mismos como parte de una comunidad global más justa y equitativa.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>LA FAMILIA</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">El valor de la familia es el corazón  de este proyecto. Los padres nos involucramos de manera muy importante en la enseñanza de nuestros hijos, pues compartimos las mismas experiencias, por tal motivo, jugamos dos papeles primordiales y principales como sus maestros y facilitadores de recursos para que cada niño logre conseguir sus metas. Nuestra tarea es fomentar en todas las experiencias la práctica de la constancia, la alegría  y la verdad para con la familia y la sociedad. Queremos crecer, aprender, explorar y descubrir el mundo con nuestros hijos, ser padres, mejores amigos para poder guiarlos con amor, libertad y respeto; hasta que decidan  ser independientes. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>TECNOLOGÍA</b><br/></p>
<p>La tecnología juega un papel muy importante en la actualidad, ya que es una forma eficiente para aprender de manera libre y divertida; también, a través del mundo digital, puedes acceder a todo tipo de información, cursos, tutoriales, aplicaciones, juegos etc. de manera inmediata y con una cantidad de posibilidades increíble, por lo tanto, es un recurso formativo necesario para el desarrollo de habilidades que les permitan tomar las mejores decisiones hacia su bienestar inmediato y futuro próximo.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>EDUCACIÓN SUPERIOR</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Los niños que provienen de sistemas no escolarizados, tienen la oportunidad de ingresar en diversas universidades, donde no es necesario un certificado formal, solo se necesita el compromiso y el deseo de aprender, como en la  Universidad Abierta de Londres  <a href=""http://www.open.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.open.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Open University</a>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p><b>MISIÓN</b></p>
<p>Honrar y confiar en las habilidades y pasiones de cada individuo, que les motive a explorar, descubrir y desarrollar sus propios talentos, aptitudes, y metas; a través de la práctica de una paternidad responsable y respetuosa de las necesidades de los niños en las distintas etapas del desarrollo humano, que les permita vivir en armonía con la naturaleza y el mundo. <br/></p>
<p><b> OBJETIVOS.</b></p>
<p>• Promover el desarrollo de los niños a través de los sentidos en estrecho contacto con la naturaleza y su entorno social inmediato.</p>
<p></p>
<p>• Fomentar el aprendizaje significativo a través de las experiencias de la vida diaria en los diferentes contextos en los cuales se desenvuelvan. </p>
<p>• Formar seres felices, creativos, emprendedores, con amplia visión, competentes con ellos mismos y con la sociedad. </p>
<p>• Formar seres multiculturales y cosmopolitas que comprendan la diversidad.</p>
<p>• Aprender idiomas. </p>
<p>• Aprender a utilizar tecnología y herramientas de vanguardia de manera que les permita el logro de sus objetivos personales y una contribución hacia la comunidad. </p>
<p>• Conjuntar el desarrollo espiritual y educativo para integrarlo en su vida cotidiana que les permita ser mejores ciudadanos del mundo.<br/></p>
<p>• Vivir una experiencia de auto reflexión para descubrirse dentro del mundo que los rodea y realizar sus aportaciones a la sociedad.</p>
<p><b>• Crear un modelo global replicable y un sistema de becas para que otras familias puedan vivir esta experiencia.</b><br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>UN DOCUMENTAL DE VIDA</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Estamos lanzando esta campaña con INDIEGOGO que nos permitirá obtener recursos para documentar las vivencias y el comportamiento de 4 niños en diferentes etapas del desarrollo, donde se fomentan valores como: el amor, el respeto, la responsabilidad que les permitan ejercer su libertad en la toma de decisiones de acuerdo a sus intereses.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">La duración del documental será por 15 años, hasta que los niños alcancen la mayoría de edad.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Metodología: </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Se realizarán campañas semestrales por región geográfica, y al final de cada semestre se producirá un documental donde podrás ver una compilación del aprendizaje, desarrollo y crecimiento que ha tenido la familia a través de las distintas experiencias. </span></p>
<p>Otros medios de difusión de las experiencias, vivencias y aventuras será a través de nuestro canal de  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChtkRWHqwlHKt7yz9wTBvcw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline !important; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Youtube</a> semanalmente y redes sociales como  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/familialopezpalacio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline !important; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">y</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/LOSLOPEZPALACIO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">twitter</a>.</p>
<p>La primera campaña semestral comienza en ESTADOS UNIDOS DE AMÉRICA en enero del 2016. </p>
<p>Hasta el momento, hemos recorrido México con nuestros propios recursos y con el apoyo de más de 50 patrocinadores durante el 2015. </p>
<p>Durante este recorrido, hemos tenido la oportunidad de conocer a diferentes comunidades de artesanos y estamos trabajando con ellos para contribuir con su desarrollo económico, cultural y social. Es por eso que algunas de las recompensas que ofrecemos son Artesanías Mexicanas. Así seguiremos conociendo artesanos y comunidades alrededor del mundo con los que podamos tener logros compartidos que permitan un desarrollo comunitario, más inclusivo.<br/></p>

<p><b>ANTECEDENTES</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Teníamos un estilo de vida bastante tradicional: Desde que tuvimos hijos se
despertó en nosotros el interés por la Educación, pues sabemos que es la
contribución más importante que nosotros como padres le podamos hacer para su
futuro. Y tenía que ser una educación donde se les suministraran conocimientos
académicos, culturales, científicos además del desarrollo de habilidades para
la vida, el amor y el respeto por la naturaleza, a partir de los cuales se
conviertan en ciudadanos responsables y cuidadosos de su entorno. En la
búsqueda de la mejor educación para nuestros hijos, probamos diferentes
sistemas, como: el montessori, constructivista y británico.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>Más tarde abrimos con
nuestros familiares y amigos “La Bella Verde”, una escuela alternativa, se cerró, al cabo de un año
porque, cambiamos nuestro lugar de residencia a Tulum Quintana Roo y ahí nos unimos
con familias de diferentes lugares del mundo (Mexicanos, Argentinos, Españoles,
Franceses, Rusos, Cubanos, Ingleses), donde conocimos diferentes sistemas
educativos y formamos la “Comunidad de Aprendizaje Amanecer” una escuela
ecológica, multicultural.</p>

<br/>
<p>Llegamos a la conclusión que nuestros hijos  no estaban interesados en aprender dentro de un salón de clases (nos decían que era muy aburrido). Después de largas platicas, mucha investigación y principalmente escuchar a los niños, encontramos la filosofía Unschooling <a href=""http://www.johnholtgws.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(conoce más)</a> que consiste en aprender de manera libre, en base a experiencias, y la llevamos a cabo por 2 años.</p>

<br/></div>","LEARNING AROUND THE WORLD

  A FUN, INNOVATIVE, AND COSMOPOLITAN EDUCATIONAL MODEL THAT GIVES CHILDREN THE FREEDOM TO THRIVE IN THIS DIGITAL AGE, SURROUNDED BY FAMILY LOVE.









We are
pioneering an adventurous educational curriculum for our kids that will span 15
years and 100 countries. Best of all: it’s FREE. Each family member
has the freedom to choose what they want to learn – following their curiosity,
interests, and goals.
Now we
need your help to fund a compelling documentary about our experiences that
will inspire others to think outside the box and take risks to live the lives
they dream.



GLOBAL
CITIZENS


We will
be living all over the world, and settle for about one year in each region, so we can learn different cultures, geography, languages, writing, architecture, customs, ecosystems, climate,
 traditions, art, economics, politics, industry, trade, human
relationships, sports, entertainment. The goal is to teach our children the
value of tolerance and mutual respect, and to do our part to build a fair and
inclusive world that embraces diversity. Everyone deserves to receive a quality
education and to learn the values that will help them become members of the
global community.
  Culture                    
                     
             Traditions
       
       Industry                                                                     Ecosystems

     

 Sports                                                     Economy


      
THE FAMILY
The value of the family is at the heart of this project. We get involved very deep in the education of our children, because we share the same experiences; for that reason, we  play  two leading roles, as teachers and as facilitators of resources for each child to achieve their goals. Our task is to encourage in every experience, the practice of perseverance, joy, order and truth to the family and society. We want to grow, learn, explore and discover the world with our children, be best friends to guide them with love, freedom and respect, until
they are ready to be independent.
TECHNOLOGY
Technology plays an important role
today because it is an efficient way to learn about free and fun way; Also,
through the digital world, we can access all kinds of information, courses,
tutorials, applications, games etc. immediately, with an incredible amount
of possibilities, therefore, it is necessary to develop skills to make the
best decisions to their immediate welfare and educational resource.
PROFESSIONAL  EDUCATION
Children coming out from non traditional
school systems have the opportunity to join various universities, where a
formal certificate is not required, only the commitment and desire to learn,
like The Open University of London.
MISSION
Honor and trust in the skills and passions of each individual that encourages them to explore, discover and develop their own talents, skills, and goals; through the practice of a responsible and respectful of the needs of children at different stages of human development, enabling them to live in harmony with nature and the world fatherhood.
 GOALS.
• Promote the development of children through the senses in close contact with nature and their immediate social environment.
• Foster meaningful learning through the experiences of daily life in the different contexts in which they unfold.
• Being happy, creative, enterprising beings with broad vision and competent with themselves and society.
• Training multicultural and cosmopolitan beings who understand the diversity.
• Learn languages.
• Learn to use cutting-edge technology and tools so as to enable them to achieve their personal goals and contribute to the community.
• Create a comprehensive replicable model for other families to share this experience and make significant contributions to existing educational models.
• Combine the spiritual and educational development to integrate it into their daily lives that allows them to be better citizens of the world and caretakers of this planet.
• To live an experience of self-reflection to discover in the world around them and make their contributions to society.
• Create a system of grants so that other families can experience this adventure.

A DOCUMENTARY OF LIFE
We
are launching this campaign to raise funds for a documentary that will follow
the experiences and behavior of four children at different stages of development, where values are fostered: love, respect, responsibility to enable them to exercise their freedom in decisions according to their interests.
The duration of the documentary will be for 15 years, until the children reach adulthood.
Methodology:
Biannual campaigns conducted by geographic region, and at the end of each semester a documentary where you will see a compilation of learning, development and growth that has taken the family through the various experiences will occur.

We’ll also transmit our experiences and adventures on  YouTube channel  
weekly and on social networks like  Facebook  and twitter.


The first semi-annual campaign begins in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in January 2016.

This past
year we have been touring around Mexico funded by our own resources and with
the support of over 50 sponsors. During this journey, we have spent time with
several artisan communities and we are interested in working with them and
contribute to their economic, cultural and social development. That is why some
of the perks we offer are Mexican handcrafts.

MEET THE FAMILY
We are a Mexican family of 6 members:
            Tania. 38 years.                                             Lalo. 43 years.  
              
                Rodrigo. 11 years.                                    Santiago. 8 years 
         
    
                 Jerónimo. 5 years  
                     
                 Diego. 3 years
        


BACKGROUND
We
used to have a fairly traditional lifestyle. But when we had kids, our own
interest in education was reawakened because we know that is the most important contribution that  as parents we can do for their future. And it had to be an education where they will provide academic knowledge, culture, science and the development of life skills, love and respect for nature, from which to become responsible citizens and caring for their environment. 
In
seeking for the best education for our children, we tried different systems,
such as Montessori, Constructivist and British.



     


We even
opened our own alternative school with friends and family called ""LA
BELLA VERDE"", but we closed it after a year because we moved to Tulum, Mexico
where we joined families from around the world (Mexico, Argentina, Spain,
France, Russia, Cuba, England) and together formed an ecological and
multicultural school called ""COMUNIDAD DE APRENDIZAJE AMANECER"".
                
We conclude that our children were not interested in learning in a classroom (they said it was very boring). After long talks, much research and mainly listen to children, we find the  Unschooling philosophy (learn more), and held  for 2 years.



                 
It was then that we decided to implement this travel philosophy and begin our adventure.
We left everything behind. Home, family, work, friends and lifestyle. This journey has been achieved with very limited financial resources, we have been able to continue with this project thanks to the support of the great people who believe in our learning model.

APRENDIENDO ALREDEDOR DEL MUNDO
EL MODELO EDUCATIVO MAS DIVERTIDO, INNOVADOR Y COSMOPOLITA, QUE DA A LOS NIÑOS TOTAL LIBERTAD PARA PROSPERAR EN ESTA ERA DIGITAL, EN UNA ATMOSFERA DE AMOR FAMILIAR 





Somos una familia  realizando un proyecto  de investigación acerca de una forma de aprendizaje libre y divertida, basado en vivencias y experiencias, donde cada niño tiene la libertad de escoger lo que desea aprender, de acuerdo a su curiosidad, necesidades, intereses y metas; siempre y cuando no interfiera con su integridad, seguridad y bienestar. Cada quien tienen el control de su propio aprendizaje y elige el qué, cómo, cuándo, dónde y por qué de su aprendizaje.



CIUDADANOS DEL MUNDO
El proyecto  consiste en vivir en diferentes lugares del mundo y establecernos aproximadamente un año en cada lugar, ya que así podemos conocer
de cada región, el idioma, escritura, arquitectura, flora, fauna, clima,
cultura, tradiciones, arte, economía, política, industria, comercio, relaciones
humanas, deportes, entretenimiento etc.; para enseñar a nuestros hijos el valor de la tolerancia y el respeto mutuo, y con ello construir un mundo más justo e inclusivo que abarque la diversidad. Todos tenemos derecho a recibir una educación de calidad basada en valores como: la paz, la tolerancia, la igualdad, el compañerismo y la solidaridad por mencionar algunos valores básicos y necesarios a partir de los cuales aprendamos a vernos a nosotros mismos como parte de una comunidad global más justa y equitativa.


Cultura                                                           Tradiciones
        
Industria                                                                     Ecosistemas


          


 Deportes                                                Economia




    

LA FAMILIA
El valor de la familia es el corazón  de este proyecto. Los padres nos involucramos de manera muy importante en la enseñanza de nuestros hijos, pues compartimos las mismas experiencias, por tal motivo, jugamos dos papeles primordiales y principales como sus maestros y facilitadores de recursos para que cada niño logre conseguir sus metas. Nuestra tarea es fomentar en todas las experiencias la práctica de la constancia, la alegría  y la verdad para con la familia y la sociedad. Queremos crecer, aprender, explorar y descubrir el mundo con nuestros hijos, ser padres, mejores amigos para poder guiarlos con amor, libertad y respeto; hasta que decidan  ser independientes. 
TECNOLOGÍA
La tecnología juega un papel muy importante en la actualidad, ya que es una forma eficiente para aprender de manera libre y divertida; también, a través del mundo digital, puedes acceder a todo tipo de información, cursos, tutoriales, aplicaciones, juegos etc. de manera inmediata y con una cantidad de posibilidades increíble, por lo tanto, es un recurso formativo necesario para el desarrollo de habilidades que les permitan tomar las mejores decisiones hacia su bienestar inmediato y futuro próximo.
EDUCACIÓN SUPERIOR
Los niños que provienen de sistemas no escolarizados, tienen la oportunidad de ingresar en diversas universidades, donde no es necesario un certificado formal, solo se necesita el compromiso y el deseo de aprender, como en la  Universidad Abierta de Londres  The Open University.

MISIÓN
Honrar y confiar en las habilidades y pasiones de cada individuo, que les motive a explorar, descubrir y desarrollar sus propios talentos, aptitudes, y metas; a través de la práctica de una paternidad responsable y respetuosa de las necesidades de los niños en las distintas etapas del desarrollo humano, que les permita vivir en armonía con la naturaleza y el mundo. 
 OBJETIVOS.
• Promover el desarrollo de los niños a través de los sentidos en estrecho contacto con la naturaleza y su entorno social inmediato.

• Fomentar el aprendizaje significativo a través de las experiencias de la vida diaria en los diferentes contextos en los cuales se desenvuelvan. 
• Formar seres felices, creativos, emprendedores, con amplia visión, competentes con ellos mismos y con la sociedad. 
• Formar seres multiculturales y cosmopolitas que comprendan la diversidad.
• Aprender idiomas. 
• Aprender a utilizar tecnología y herramientas de vanguardia de manera que les permita el logro de sus objetivos personales y una contribución hacia la comunidad. 
• Conjuntar el desarrollo espiritual y educativo para integrarlo en su vida cotidiana que les permita ser mejores ciudadanos del mundo.
• Vivir una experiencia de auto reflexión para descubrirse dentro del mundo que los rodea y realizar sus aportaciones a la sociedad.
• Crear un modelo global replicable y un sistema de becas para que otras familias puedan vivir esta experiencia.

UN DOCUMENTAL DE VIDA
Estamos lanzando esta campaña con INDIEGOGO que nos permitirá obtener recursos para documentar las vivencias y el comportamiento de 4 niños en diferentes etapas del desarrollo, donde se fomentan valores como: el amor, el respeto, la responsabilidad que les permitan ejercer su libertad en la toma de decisiones de acuerdo a sus intereses.
La duración del documental será por 15 años, hasta que los niños alcancen la mayoría de edad.
Metodología: 
Se realizarán campañas semestrales por región geográfica, y al final de cada semestre se producirá un documental donde podrás ver una compilación del aprendizaje, desarrollo y crecimiento que ha tenido la familia a través de las distintas experiencias. 
Otros medios de difusión de las experiencias, vivencias y aventuras será a través de nuestro canal de  Youtube semanalmente y redes sociales como  Facebook  y twitter.
La primera campaña semestral comienza en ESTADOS UNIDOS DE AMÉRICA en enero del 2016. 
Hasta el momento, hemos recorrido México con nuestros propios recursos y con el apoyo de más de 50 patrocinadores durante el 2015. 
Durante este recorrido, hemos tenido la oportunidad de conocer a diferentes comunidades de artesanos y estamos trabajando con ellos para contribuir con su desarrollo económico, cultural y social. Es por eso que algunas de las recompensas que ofrecemos son Artesanías Mexicanas. Así seguiremos conociendo artesanos y comunidades alrededor del mundo con los que podamos tener logros compartidos que permitan un desarrollo comunitario, más inclusivo.

Franceses, Rusos, Cubanos, Ingleses), donde conocimos diferentes sistemas
educativos y formamos la “Comunidad de Aprendizaje Amanecer” una escuela
ecológica, multicultural.

     

Llegamos a la conclusión que nuestros hijos  no estaban interesados en aprender dentro de un salón de clases (nos decían que era muy aburrido). Después de largas platicas, mucha investigación y principalmente escuchar a los niños, encontramos la filosofía Unschooling (conoce más) que consiste en aprender de manera libre, en base a experiencias, y la llevamos a cabo por 2 años.

       
Fue entonces que decidimos implementar los viajes a esta filosofía.
Así fué como finalmente surgió este proyecto.
Dejamos atrás todo . Casa, familia, amigos, trabajo y estilo de vida para emprender esta aventura.

Este recorrido lo hemos logrado con recursos económicos muy limitados,
pero gracias al apoyo de la gente hemos podido seguir adelante con este sueño.

</h1><p>
</p><p>I am <b>Okereke Matthew Chukwunaenye</b>,
an Igbo from <b>Biafra</b> Land in Nigeria. I am an upcoming and pioneering African writer
of Science Fiction novels. I lost my mother at age five and to escape from the hostile and uncaring world that confronts an average motherless child I created an Utopia wherein all my dreams and desires comes true. And, that was the birth of the writer in me.<br/></p><h3>
<b>My Campaign</b>: 600 <b>Free
Books to College Students</b>
</h3>
<p>My dear friends – citizens of the
world and one children of the same Mother Earth – I had deliberately climbed
the highest mountain any fecund imagination could deduce just facing the fabled
“Deep Blue Sea”; and, having reached the pinnacle and blindfolded myself, it is
now my uttermost desire to plunged into the yawning chasm of uncertainty
awaiting me in the bosom of the unpredictable Sea, not to commit a hara-kiri,
no, or indulge in Adrenalin pumping risky behavior, but <b>to test the depth of
human kindness.</b></p>
<p>Recently, on the heels of the
explosions in social media and info-web technology, the reading culture of
African youths had plummeted drastically and the quality of readily available
literature rarely inspires these young minds to venture forth in the New Age
beyond the worlds of virtual reality and video games. </p>
<p>Technically, the Science Fiction
genre, which I am pioneering in the Mother Continent, is alien to Africa’s literally concept for now. </p><h2>
</h2><h2>
<span><span></span></span><b>The Target! </b>
</h2>
<p>Initially, my desire was to place in
the hands of one hundred thousand college and undergraduate students of the
world, fifty thousand each, six copies (the complete series) making a total of
six hundred thousand copies of the pioneering African sci-fi epic – <b>LA CHIMAERA
PROTOCOL</b> (in loving memories of my late parents and relatives) – through a
concerted worldwide crowd-funding campaign initiative but the total cost was
mind-boggling and so I came down to six copies each for one hundred students
totaling six hundred books.</p>
<p>The books in the series include:</p>
<p><span><b>1.</b><span>  </span></span>The End Game
Gamble – Published (389 pages).</p>
<p><span><b>2.</b><span>  </span></span>The Dark Side
of Light – Manuscript ready for editing.</p>
<p><span><b>3.</b><span>  </span></span>The 0<sup>th</sup>
Angels’ Rising – Manuscript ready for editing.</p>
<p><span><b>4.</b><span>  </span></span>The Vague
Factor’s Edge – Manuscript ready for Editing.</p>
<p><span><b>5.</b><span>  </span></span>The Omega
Point Revolution – Manuscript ready for Editing.</p>
<p><span><b>6.</b><span>  </span></span>The Timeline
Warrior – Manuscript ready for Editing.</p>
<p>Hopefully, with your contributions,
the lucky students would be in possession of their copies on or before <b>16<sup>th</sup>
June, 2016</b> which marked the 10<sup>th</sup> year anniversary of my father’s
death and on the day I equally wish to remember the over 30 years death of my
mother. I don’t have a record of the exact day and month of my mother's death. <br/></p><b>Aim and Impact of the Campaign!</b>
<p>This humbling campaign seeks, among
others, to achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p><span><b>i.</b><span> 
</span></span>To rekindle the waning interest in
youth’s reading culture;</p><p><b>ii.</b> To present as Free Gifts copies of my works to my students who yearn to read me but can't afford the cost of my works;<br/></p>
<p><span><b>iii.</b><span> 
</span></span>To open up the reading space and
introduce them into science fiction genre;</p>
<p><span><b>iv.</b><span> 
</span></span>To inspire the youth into tinkering
with imaginative insights which a sci-fi affords;</p>
<p><span><b>v.</b><span> 
</span></span>To honor the memories of<span>  my late parents, siblings and relatives for
the debts of gratitude I owe them;</span></p>
<p><span><b>vi.</b><span> 
</span></span>To also use it as an opportunity to
promote my works and garner the exposure I need as an unknown sci-fi writer
from Africa.</p>
<h4>
<span><span></span></span><b>The Magnitude of what your Kindness will Help us Achieve</b>. </h4>
<p><span><b>i.</b><span> 
</span></span>To achieve the above aims and
objectives of this campaign that is why you are reading this. <b>See budget below</b>.
</p>
<p><span><b>ii.</b><span> 
</span></span>To successfully prosecute this notable
“Free Book Campaign” I graciously request your kind contributions.</p>
<h2>
<span><span></span></span><b>The Budget!</b>
</h2>
<p>The total cost is approximately
$22000</p>
<p>Cost of a book = $20</p>
<p>Shipping cost = $11.99 (32 days
delivery time)</p>
<p>Total cost = $31.99. (Cost of book
and shipping)</p>
<p>Cost of 600 Books: $20x600 =$12000</p>
<p>Shipping cost of 600 Books:
$11.99x600 = $7194</p>
<p>Charges and tax approximately
10%:<span>  $2000</span></p>
<p>Total cost = $21194 (approximately
$22000).</p>
<h3>
<span><span></span></span><b>Where the funds go if we don't reach the entire goal</b>.</h3>
<p>Every contribution counts. The cost
of a book is $31.99 (cost of Book and shipping) so if we realize $31.99 I will
send a copy of the books to a student. </p>
<p>If the goal is reached, then the
shipping cost for the six hundred books would reduce since the books would be
purchased in bulk.</p>
<p>Contributors who wish could also
request to personally handle the distribution of their copies to any student(s)
of their choice.</p>

Learning Center to allow learners to review all photos and sound recordings at their own pace
Beginner's Mode for new birders
Level tracking (Watch your progress and earn tokens to unlock new levels!)
Advanced birders can polish their skills with Timed Mode, or play using Scientific Names
One of Kea's several bird ID games
Key field marks to look for when identifying each species
Thousands of photographs of different genders and plumages, and hundreds of recordings (with new material being added all the time!)
We're just getting started, but we think we've got a great App, one that makes birding more available to new birders, and that provides experienced birders the chance to get to the next level.We've got a lot of exciting plans to make the App better and better, and to get there, we're offering deals on unlocking expansions as they come out.  We're also offering a chance to get ""behind the curtain"" and help direct the future of the App, to build the App you want to see.Some of the awesome functions we would like to build with crowdsourcing funding:
Explore the birds of the world, location by location.  Pick a spot on Earth and play a game to learn the birds in that location
Submit your own photos, videos and recordings, and rate submissions from other users
Build your own custom levels.  Send them to friends and challenge each other with new quizzes!
Complete coverage of all the World's birds in all the world's geographic regions
Incorporate several new games and a steady stream of new photographs to continually sharpen skills
On behalf of us at Kea, thank you for taking to the time to check out our campaign, and thanks for helping us build the most fun, geographically inclusive, and just plain best Birding App on Earth!Oh, and why are we called ""Kea""?  Kea are inventive, curious, precocious, mischievous, and very possibly the smartest birds in the planet.  Unlike most birds, they can solve complex problems involving teamwork, learn from the examples of others, and lead complex social lives.  So how do they learn all these complex behaviors?  The same way we do.  Also rare among birds, Keas play!Our mascot: the clever, the plucky, the playful, the Kea.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Introduction</h3> <p>Hong Kong's emblem is the beautiful Bauhinia flower and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhinia_%C3%97_blakeana#Usage_as_an_emblem"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">appears on our flag</a>. This is the flower of the orchid tree <i>Bauhinia blakeana</i>, which was first discovered in Hong Kong. What many people may not know is that it is a sterile hybrid, and how and why it ended up in Hong Kong is shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to help uncover the secrets of any organism is by understanding its genetic makeup. Genomics, sequencing of the genetic code of organisms, provides a complete look into the genetic complement of any species. It is also one of the key technologies that will define the 21st century. While Hong Kong has made major advances in this field, the general public may have little awareness and understanding of what this field even is.</p>
<p>By bringing together the emblematic and mysterious Bauhinia flower and the power and knowledge of genome technology, we can build a bridge between science and community— enlightening our understanding of this plant’s interesting biology and informing and educating the public about this exciting and rapidly advancing field.</p>
<p>To build such a collaborative endeavour, we are launching the <a href=""http://bauhiniagenome.hk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hong Kong genome project</a> through which we will sequence the genome of the Hong Kong emblem to better understand where it came from; train local students to assemble and analyse the data — crucial skills needed for this field to advance; and engage the public through local pride.</p>
<p>This will be the first Hong Kong genome project: funded by the public; sequenced in Hong Kong; assembled and analysed by local students; and directly shared with the public. We also welcome contributions and interest from the rest of the world, hoping this serves as a model to inspire and inform other national genome projects, and aid the development of crucial genomic literacy and skills across the globe, inspiring and training a new generation of scientists to use these tools to tackle the biggest threats to mankind: climate change, disease, and food security.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <p></p>
<p><b>Why Bauhinia?</b><br/>The flower of <i>Bauhinia blakeana</i> was adopted as the emblem of Hong Kong in 1965 and, since 1997, has been part of the flag of the Hong Kong SAR. The tree was first discovered by a French missionary, Father Jean-Marie Delavay, in the 1880s, growing on the West of Hong Kong Island.  The missionary collector subsequently propagated it in the grounds of the nearby Pokfulam Sanatorium, and from there it was introduced to the <a href=""http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/parks/hkzbg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hong Kong Botanic Gardens</a> and across the world. Originally described as a new species in 1908, it was subsequently named after the Hong Kong governor Sir Henry Blake, who had a strong interest in botany. The hybrid origin and the parentage of <i>Bauhinia blakeana</i> remains enigmatic. In 1903 the Botanical and Afforestation Department <a href=""http://www.herbarium.gov.hk/SpecialTopicsDetails.aspx?oneId=20&amp;SectionId=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reported</a> ""The mysterious origin of the tree and its magnificent flowers at once arrest the interest. … So far, all efforts to identify them with any foreign species have failed"". Studies using individual genetic markers— ancestral footprints in the plant’s DNA — <a href=""dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2007.00591.x"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">have shown</a> that the species is likely a hybrid of two local species, <i>Bauhinia variegata</i> and <i>Bauhinia purpurea</i>, but this has yet to be confirmed at a genomic scale. Further, this unique plant, with its showy tree that flowers much longer and more intensely than its related species, can reveal many other biological secrets concerning its own characteristic and those of other plant species.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why Genomics?</b><br/>The human genome project, completed just under 15 years ago, cost ~3 billion US dollars and took ten years to sequence the DNA of a human being. The technology has progressed so rapidly we can now sequence a plant such as Bauhinia for about a millionth of the cost and in a fraction of the time. The legacy of the human genome project is such that technology that was science fiction just a decade or two ago has become a routine part of scientific research and a common component of our medical toolkit. The cost is now is so low that there have already been examples of community funded genome projects in other parts of the world. For example, the Puerto Rican parrot, one of the most endangered species in the world and iconic emblem symbol of the Caribbean island, was sequenced <a href=""http://www.bio-itworld.com/2012/09/28/peoples-parrot-first-community-sponsored-genome.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">solely through local funding in 2012</a> to aid the captive breeding program. </p>Hong Kong has made key contributions to the field field of genomics, local researchers making <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/01/dennis-lo-prenatal-research-cancer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">key breakthroughs</a> in circulating DNA testing, and since 2010 hosting the world’s largest sequencing centre at BGI Hong Kong. Genomics is <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002195"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">predicted to produce the biggest ""big data""</a> over the next 10 years, and despite Hong Kong being world-leading in producing technologies and data, there is very little awareness and training to capitalise on this. Understanding of the cutting edge work in this rapidly growing field by the Hong Kong public is very poor, with little local awareness as to what it entails, and how it will be soon impacting upon all of their lives. To maximise the benefits to the Hong Kong economy and healthcare system of what will be the growth industry defining the 21st century, a new generation needs to be trained to capitalise on the potential resources here. We’d like to inspire a future generation of genomics data analysts to make Hong Kong a world leader in this field.<br/><p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need your money to kickstart the first ""made in Hong Kong genome project, enabling the collection of the necessary data, and inspiring students and others to join this endeavour, learning the skills and what is involved in putting together a genome project. <br/><p></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Accomplishing the outlined goals requires funding to cover the chemicals and components for producing the sequencing data for the project. The rest of the labour and analysis costs will be carried out by the contributing team and by BGI Hong Kong and CUHK for free.</p></li>
<li>This is a community project, and we want the community to contribute by finding and reporting specimens, and in assembling the genome (see below).</li>
</ul>
<br/> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Educate the public and help train a new generation of genomics experts in Hong Kong and beyond, able to capitalize and contribute to a new scientific revolution.</p></li>
<li><p>Making all of the outputs of the project immediately open allows them to
 be immediately used by others and integrated into educational resources such 
as wikipedia.</p></li>
<li><p>This will be the first species in the genus to be sequenced, helping evolutionary biologists resolve where these species fit in the tree of life.</p></li>
<li>Bauhinia is a potential treasure trove for medical research. <a href=""http://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=rjmp.2011.420.431&amp;org=10"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Previous research</a> has found antibacterial, antidiabetic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-diarrheal, anti-cancerous, kidney-protective, anti-ulcer and thyroid hormone-regulating properties of many of these species, and characterising the genes is an important step in developing potential new drugs for these conditions.</li>
<li>Hybrid genomes are very difficult to study, and this will be an 
important case study on how to carry out and improve this technological 
challenge, so that future hybrid organisms can be more easily conquered.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<ul>

<br/></p><p></p></div>","Introduction Hong Kong's emblem is the beautiful Bauhinia flower and appears on our flag. This is the flower of the orchid tree Bauhinia blakeana, which was first discovered in Hong Kong. What many people may not know is that it is a sterile hybrid, and how and why it ended up in Hong Kong is shrouded in mystery.
One of the best ways to help uncover the secrets of any organism is by understanding its genetic makeup. Genomics, sequencing of the genetic code of organisms, provides a complete look into the genetic complement of any species. It is also one of the key technologies that will define the 21st century. While Hong Kong has made major advances in this field, the general public may have little awareness and understanding of what this field even is.
By bringing together the emblematic and mysterious Bauhinia flower and the power and knowledge of genome technology, we can build a bridge between science and community— enlightening our understanding of this plant’s interesting biology and informing and educating the public about this exciting and rapidly advancing field.
To build such a collaborative endeavour, we are launching the Hong Kong genome project through which we will sequence the genome of the Hong Kong emblem to better understand where it came from; train local students to assemble and analyse the data — crucial skills needed for this field to advance; and engage the public through local pride.
This will be the first Hong Kong genome project: funded by the public; sequenced in Hong Kong; assembled and analysed by local students; and directly shared with the public. We also welcome contributions and interest from the rest of the world, hoping this serves as a model to inspire and inform other national genome projects, and aid the development of crucial genomic literacy and skills across the globe, inspiring and training a new generation of scientists to use these tools to tackle the biggest threats to mankind: climate change, disease, and food security.
   
Why Bauhinia?The flower of Bauhinia blakeana was adopted as the emblem of Hong Kong in 1965 and, since 1997, has been part of the flag of the Hong Kong SAR. The tree was first discovered by a French missionary, Father Jean-Marie Delavay, in the 1880s, growing on the West of Hong Kong Island.  The missionary collector subsequently propagated it in the grounds of the nearby Pokfulam Sanatorium, and from there it was introduced to the Hong Kong Botanic Gardens and across the world. Originally described as a new species in 1908, it was subsequently named after the Hong Kong governor Sir Henry Blake, who had a strong interest in botany. The hybrid origin and the parentage of Bauhinia blakeana remains enigmatic. In 1903 the Botanical and Afforestation Department reported ""The mysterious origin of the tree and its magnificent flowers at once arrest the interest. … So far, all efforts to identify them with any foreign species have failed"". Studies using individual genetic markers— ancestral footprints in the plant’s DNA — have shown that the species is likely a hybrid of two local species, Bauhinia variegata and Bauhinia purpurea, but this has yet to be confirmed at a genomic scale. Further, this unique plant, with its showy tree that flowers much longer and more intensely than its related species, can reveal many other biological secrets concerning its own characteristic and those of other plant species.

Why Genomics?The human genome project, completed just under 15 years ago, cost ~3 billion US dollars and took ten years to sequence the DNA of a human being. The technology has progressed so rapidly we can now sequence a plant such as Bauhinia for about a millionth of the cost and in a fraction of the time. The legacy of the human genome project is such that technology that was science fiction just a decade or two ago has become a routine part of scientific research and a common component of our medical toolkit. The cost is now is so low that there have already been examples of community funded genome projects in other parts of the world. For example, the Puerto Rican parrot, one of the most endangered species in the world and iconic emblem symbol of the Caribbean island, was sequenced solely through local funding in 2012 to aid the captive breeding program. Hong Kong has made key contributions to the field field of genomics, local researchers making key breakthroughs in circulating DNA testing, and since 2010 hosting the world’s largest sequencing centre at BGI Hong Kong. Genomics is predicted to produce the biggest ""big data"" over the next 10 years, and despite Hong Kong being world-leading in producing technologies and data, there is very little awareness and training to capitalise on this. Understanding of the cutting edge work in this rapidly growing field by the Hong Kong public is very poor, with little local awareness as to what it entails, and how it will be soon impacting upon all of their lives. To maximise the benefits to the Hong Kong economy and healthcare system of what will be the growth industry defining the 21st century, a new generation needs to be trained to capitalise on the potential resources here. We’d like to inspire a future generation of genomics data analysts to make Hong Kong a world leader in this field.
What We Need & What You GetWe need your money to kickstart the first ""made in Hong Kong genome project, enabling the collection of the necessary data, and inspiring students and others to join this endeavour, learning the skills and what is involved in putting together a genome project. 

Accomplishing the outlined goals requires funding to cover the chemicals and components for producing the sequencing data for the project. The rest of the labour and analysis costs will be carried out by the contributing team and by BGI Hong Kong and CUHK for free.
This is a community project, and we want the community to contribute by finding and reporting specimens, and in assembling the genome (see below).

 The Impact

Educate the public and help train a new generation of genomics experts in Hong Kong and beyond, able to capitalize and contribute to a new scientific revolution.
Making all of the outputs of the project immediately open allows them to
 be immediately used by others and integrated into educational resources such 
as wikipedia.
This will be the first species in the genus to be sequenced, helping evolutionary biologists resolve where these species fit in the tree of life.
Bauhinia is a potential treasure trove for medical research. Previous research has found antibacterial, antidiabetic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-diarrheal, anti-cancerous, kidney-protective, anti-ulcer and thyroid hormone-regulating properties of many of these species, and characterising the genes is an important step in developing potential new drugs for these conditions.
Hybrid genomes are very difficult to study, and this will be an 
important case study on how to carry out and improve this technological 
challenge, so that future hybrid organisms can be more easily conquered.
   Risks & Challenges 

This is an ambitious project as plant genomes are very difficult to assemble, and a sequencing a hybrid is even more of a challenge.
This is only a draft-quality genome, so more study is needed to produce a high-quality draft. Hopefully this project will be a springboard to enable that.
To address these challenges, the scientists involved have an established track record working with Bauhinia and plant genomes, and BGI has sequenced and assembled hundreds of plant genomes, many much larger and more challenging than Bauhinia.
   Other Ways You Can Help 

Become a Spotter. Follow the Bauhinias bloom as they come into season this month, and see how many species you can find. Announce your findings by twitter or instagram using the hashtag #Bauhiniawatch when you see this happen and include the geographic location so we can track this across Hong Kong.
Join the hunt for Bauhinia seeds. Despite being sterile, in very rare cases Bauhinia blakeana has been seen to produce seed pods. We are very interested in studying this phenomenon, so be sure to let us and the HKU Department of Botany know if you spot any, and we will collect samples. Use the #Bauhiniawatch hashtag on social media to report any sightings.

Spread the word. This is a community project and the number of contributors is more important than how much they give. If you love science, Bauhinias and Hong Kong, no contribution is too small.
Share this page, follow us on social media, and spread the word with the hashtags #Bauhiniawatch & #HKgenome.
Build your own genome. We are looking for volunteers from other universities, students and the public to assemble and analyse this genome data, and are keen to encourage others to follow in our footsteps and launch their own national emblematic genome projects. All data, methods and published output will be made immediately publicly available and open to enable others to learn, repeat and build upon this work.This is a completely made in Hong Kong project, and we want to involve all sectors of the community – students in the other universities and even work with schools. Everything will be Open Data and the materials used to inspire and train other projects around the world.UPDATE: We'd like to thank all our supporters to date, especially

<h3><b>Use of funds</b></h3>
<p>For the beginning we are assuring investment
capital to arrange for a modern and scalable “state of the art” infrastructure.
This includes a physical place at a suitable location at Barcelona as well as
the IT-infrastructure and office equipment. </p>
<p>The place will be equipped with all that will be needed: conference rooms,
secretary’s office, community zones and very flexible working offices.</p>
<p>Besides the infrastructure it’s necessary to announce and promote <b>The Software Garage</b> through marketing
campaigns.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>
<b>Source of funds</b> </h3>
<p><span>We are asking here at Indiegogo for 850.000 Euros in order to get necessary
approvals and entry investments to a selected “state of the art” facility. The
more support we get the shorter the timeline will get to welcome you to the
Software Garage.  </span></p>
<p>To achieve our goals we already have additionally capital
commitments in place. We also use about 25% of the funds to launch a number of first
developments to the benefit of local developers and crowd funders. The
participants of <b>The Software Garage</b> shall
benefit that’s the reason why we want to get it started and well known here. </p>
<p>We expect finished projects coming out of <b>The

We are a team of IT experts and economists of
international origin settled down in Spain under MAINSTAP.
Unfortunately, often financial and/or human
resources are missing or limited to implement ideas and projects or even
realize prototypes. There are thousands of potential ideas of the many
thousands of young or free IT, software and computing geniuses from 3D print
software to quantum computing reaching out to find your collaboration and
support under the roof of The Software Garage. 
There is a chance to get all the thousands of
workless, destitute developers, tinkerer and (young) engineers together and to
use the expertise and talents of each for a better living.
Let us stick and work together to tackle it!

What we need and what you get

We will fund a physical place close to Barcelona, where
many engineers and developers can meet and work together with the complementary
experts needed to finish new products and developments, i.e. designers,
marketing experts, etc.
The Software Garage offers
the opportunity to bring the existing talents and experts together and to defy
the difficult conditions at the labour market and regarding the current
economic environment. Whilst there are many co-working spaces, there is nothing
that specific and impacting as the Software Garage. There will be workshops, conferences
and other think tank events under the roof of The Software Garage.
Conceptual and desired environment of our The Software Garage, close by city of Barcelona, beaches, nature and international airport.
For different reasons Barcelona is the right
location for The Software Garage: 



Many well
educated people with corresponding know how and skills


Wide range of leisure and recreational activities incl. cultural
sights


Location:
Logistically well connected (local, national and global)


Hotspot
for the international software industry (World Mobile Congress)



--> Best preconditions for a conducive atmosphere to work
and live.

Participants of The
Software Garage will benefit from the network and the think tank events under
the roof of The Software Garage. The
Interactions
between you, software companies, other entrepreneurs and experts will have a
positive impact on your business results or even get your business or project started.
You will expand the reach of your own project(s) and also get access to new
projects. The network and teamwork promotes innovation and where all participants
can benefit. I.e. Engineers, scientists and developers and have the
chance to become independent entrepreneur in a multi-purpose environment of
MAINSTAP HOLDING INC..

Depending on the money you spend you will receive different
kind of benefits and gifts:

Use of funds
For the beginning we are assuring investment
capital to arrange for a modern and scalable “state of the art” infrastructure.
This includes a physical place at a suitable location at Barcelona as well as
the IT-infrastructure and office equipment. 
The place will be equipped with all that will be needed: conference rooms,
secretary’s office, community zones and very flexible working offices.
Besides the infrastructure it’s necessary to announce and promote The Software Garage through marketing
campaigns.


Source of funds 
We are asking here at Indiegogo for 850.000 Euros in order to get necessary
approvals and entry investments to a selected “state of the art” facility. The
more support we get the shorter the timeline will get to welcome you to the
Software Garage.  
To achieve our goals we already have additionally capital
commitments in place. We also use about 25% of the funds to launch a number of first
developments to the benefit of local developers and crowd funders. The
participants of The Software Garage shall
benefit that’s the reason why we want to get it started and well known here. 
We expect finished projects coming out of The
Software Garage already by 2015 and 2016 reaching revenue and
beyond. Our current members are working on:


improved optical recognition and data processing systems

new global standard for mobile electronic commerce
(i.e. the big business apps)


gaming experience


safety concepts


early desease recognition systems


improved live trading platforms


industrial applications


logistics


health support technology


social and cultural encounters


crypto currency systems


virtual reality


A.I.


global crowd banking assistance



......
and growing. 



Currently The
Software Garage is a connection/cluster of different companies which
collaborate, share ideas, complement and support each other on a virtual basis.
There is no common physical working space in place, yet/so far. We would like
to expand the existing network and to extend the collaboration with existing
and new participants of The Software
Garage, also on a common physical basis. Let us use the existing potential
of available talents and experts to adapt competencies and to develop and doing
business. 
More participants --> more work --> more revenue potential

<p>We are four students currently enrolled in the bachelor Business Administration at the Nyenrode New Business University.

<p></p>
<h3>The project</h3>
<p>'Freedom Through Education' is an initiative of the Round Table of India. The project was set up in 1998 and builds schools in India for the children that need it most. Our school has been participating in this project for 9 years. This year there is a total of 4 groups of students that are going to India. Every group will be visiting another region.

You are giving underprivileged children the opportunity to follow education and develop themselves. Probably you are still at school, or you are a parent who is so proud of his or her child that is developing itself so fast.

We look forward enthusiastically to building the Open Road community, serving more teens, and providing more opportunities for learning, growth, challenge, fun, and adventure!</p><h3>Our Funding Needs Today</h3><p><b>Open Road At A Crossroads</b></p><p>Though we're proud of how much the 20+ kids we've served have grown in the last two years, we have not been able to raise enough revenue to meet expenses.  As such, we've had to make the difficult decision to suspend primary operations for the next 1-3 years while we build towards a sustainable fiscal model and more robust program.  During this time, we will continue to work with existing members; we'll also focus on gaining a better understanding of the needs of Portland’s teens and their families, building our presence in Portland, providing community-wide programming (not only restricted to members), hosting community forums around teen and education issues, and building our network of community partners ready to work with our teens now and once we relaunch.  We believe that this focus will allow us to better understand and serve the needs of the Portland community, while also generating more partnerships and momentum around our relaunch that will help make Open Road an integral part of the education landscape here and provide more exciting opportunities for our members.  We’ve also added a new co-director, Joel Morrow (an Open Road volunteer for two years), who will join Alan to give Open Road two volunteer directors.  In short, we'll continue to operate as a much smaller business, consolidating and retooling to emerge stronger and sustainable.</p><br/><p><b>What We Need</b></p><p>We’re revising our business plan to build towards sustainability, while continuing our direct work with kids.  Your gift will contribute to general funds that will allow us to meet our basic expenses (stipends for certain program volunteers, fees for professional services, insurance, program delivery, occasional space rental, etc.) while we move forward without much of the tuition revenue we’ve had in the past.</p><br/><p>Our annual crowdfunding campaign has surpassed $10,000 in each of our first two years, and we're targeting that again in 2015.  As we remain very much in our start-up phase, every dollar counts!  In the past, we have forgone perks and prizes in order to put all of the donations we receive to work for our teens, and we'll do that again this year.  So what do you get?  Well, you get the satisfaction of knowing that you're helping change the lives of kids who need a different approach to their education than traditional school can give them.  And really, what better prize is there than the gift of giving back?</p><h3>The Impact of Your Support</h3><p>The video above shows some of the impact as described by some current members, and the <a href=""https://youtu.be/GhxosMYllVc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video from last year's campaign</a> shows more, with some commentary from parents as well.  Many of our teens were having a terrible time in traditional school and losing their connection to the things they loved.  At Open Road, these same kids have thrived.</p><br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Whether or not you can make a donation, you can help this campaign succeed in other ways:</p><ul>
<li><p>First and foremost, please share this campaign among your crowd!  Let folks know what we do and why you support it, and encourage them to come to this page and check it out for themselves.  If you can set a modest goal of getting 1-3 additional people to donate, you can help us raise significantly more money.  Share via email, social media, word of mouth - whatever is easiest.  But however you share, a personal endorsement from you will capture people's attention far more than a simple shared link.</p></li>
<li><p>We try to get a lot of visibility through <a href=""http://facebook.com/openroadteens"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our Facebook page</a>.  But the way Facebook works, if you like our page but don't regularly like and share our posts, you'll stop seeing us altogether. And if we post a lot but don't get many likes or shares, our posts lose a lot of their impact. So perhaps the easiest way you can help, if you're on Facebook, is to like our page AND like and share many of our posts.  If you've already liked our page but haven't been seeing content, go to the page and like a bunch of recent posts, and you should start seeing things from us again.<br/></p></li>

We look forward enthusiastically to building the Open Road community, serving more teens, and providing more opportunities for learning, growth, challenge, fun, and adventure!Our Funding Needs TodayOpen Road At A CrossroadsThough we're proud of how much the 20+ kids we've served have grown in the last two years, we have not been able to raise enough revenue to meet expenses.  As such, we've had to make the difficult decision to suspend primary operations for the next 1-3 years while we build towards a sustainable fiscal model and more robust program.  During this time, we will continue to work with existing members; we'll also focus on gaining a better understanding of the needs of Portland’s teens and their families, building our presence in Portland, providing community-wide programming (not only restricted to members), hosting community forums around teen and education issues, and building our network of community partners ready to work with our teens now and once we relaunch.  We believe that this focus will allow us to better understand and serve the needs of the Portland community, while also generating more partnerships and momentum around our relaunch that will help make Open Road an integral part of the education landscape here and provide more exciting opportunities for our members.  We’ve also added a new co-director, Joel Morrow (an Open Road volunteer for two years), who will join Alan to give Open Road two volunteer directors.  In short, we'll continue to operate as a much smaller business, consolidating and retooling to emerge stronger and sustainable.What We NeedWe’re revising our business plan to build towards sustainability, while continuing our direct work with kids.  Your gift will contribute to general funds that will allow us to meet our basic expenses (stipends for certain program volunteers, fees for professional services, insurance, program delivery, occasional space rental, etc.) while we move forward without much of the tuition revenue we’ve had in the past.Our annual crowdfunding campaign has surpassed $10,000 in each of our first two years, and we're targeting that again in 2015.  As we remain very much in our start-up phase, every dollar counts!  In the past, we have forgone perks and prizes in order to put all of the donations we receive to work for our teens, and we'll do that again this year.  So what do you get?  Well, you get the satisfaction of knowing that you're helping change the lives of kids who need a different approach to their education than traditional school can give them.  And really, what better prize is there than the gift of giving back?The Impact of Your SupportThe video above shows some of the impact as described by some current members, and the video from last year's campaign shows more, with some commentary from parents as well.  Many of our teens were having a terrible time in traditional school and losing their connection to the things they loved.  At Open Road, these same kids have thrived.Other Ways You Can HelpWhether or not you can make a donation, you can help this campaign succeed in other ways:
First and foremost, please share this campaign among your crowd!  Let folks know what we do and why you support it, and encourage them to come to this page and check it out for themselves.  If you can set a modest goal of getting 1-3 additional people to donate, you can help us raise significantly more money.  Share via email, social media, word of mouth - whatever is easiest.  But however you share, a personal endorsement from you will capture people's attention far more than a simple shared link.
We try to get a lot of visibility through our Facebook page.  But the way Facebook works, if you like our page but don't regularly like and share our posts, you'll stop seeing us altogether. And if we post a lot but don't get many likes or shares, our posts lose a lot of their impact. So perhaps the easiest way you can help, if you're on Facebook, is to like our page AND like and share many of our posts.  If you've already liked our page but haven't been seeing content, go to the page and like a bunch of recent posts, and you should start seeing things from us again.
If you know any families in the Portland area who might be interested in Open Road, let them know about us!

<p></p>
<p><b>Who am I to do this?</b><br/>
<br/>
Being half Syrian I have first-hand experience of
family and friends devastated by the situation, being displaced, separated and
if remaining in Syria, struggling on a daily basis to maintain their basic
needs and safety.  </p>
<p>Syria is also deeply ingrained in my professional
life, with my undertaking of a PhD on Syrian
civil society and the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/07/syria-nonviolent-movement-freedom-justice"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">non-violent
movements</a> of the uprising. In spite of this,  I felt I was doing little to practically support
the people who have been struggling through the situation for over 4 and a half
years. </p>
<p>So fed up one day with my
inaction, I came across the work of the NGO <a href=""http://www.reliefandreconciliation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Relief &amp; Reconciliation for Syria</a>
and their call for project volunteers for their Ramadan Summer Programme. After
applying to run the Syria's Young Creative Writers I was gifted with the
opportunity to run the project for two weeks in September as part of their
larger Youth Press Club. </p>
<p><b>What is the Project about? </b><br/>
<br/>
The project involves working with groups of students from Syria, between the ages
of 14 and 19 years old, who are currently supported by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/relief4syria"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Relief and Reconciliation</a> at
their <a href=""http://www.reliefandreconciliation.org/the-first-peace-centre.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace
Centre</a> in Akkar, Northern Lebanon. <br/>
<br/>
The objective of the project is to encourage the creative thoughts and
expressions of those who have experienced conflict, loss and tragedy. By taking
part in this they would instead be able to use their imagination in a positive,
constructive and creative way to write about anything they choose.<br/>
<br/>
Upon completion of the students writing their stories, poems, plays, scripts or
other form of creative writing I will be publishing them in a book
collection. Not only is this important for the students as a recognition
of their work but also for their voices and stories to be heard internationally
so that they can be seen as individuals and not just a statistic which is all
too often the case in the media. </p>
<p><b>The Impact of the Project<br/></b><br/>
<span>Importantly this project aims to improve their English
language skills and their ability to express their thoughts. While
developing writing skills is always an element of learning English, creative
writing, which promotes independent and creative thought, is usually only a
small element of courses aimed at developing language skills. </span></p>
<p>In this way, in order to really promote a continuous
use of the language outside of the classroom this project aims to encourage a
student to really interact with the language by thinking and using the language
in a personal and imaginative way. As such most of the activities we intend to
undertake aim not only to develop the student’s language skills but also give
them a sense of ownership of the language and of their own thoughts and
expressions. This as a consequence will aid in building a student’s confidence
in their abilities to use the language in different situations, especially
outside the classroom. </p>
<p>This project also aims to create an alternative space, physically,
socially and psychologically. This is vital in encouraging creative and
critical thinking, which is one of the foundations necessary for rebuilding a
future Syria to which one day such people will hopefully be able to return.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Purchase the commercial property</span><br/>

<h3>What Kind Of Impact Can We Make Together?</h3> <p>With over 25% of the population expected to have diabetes or pre-diabetes by 2020, the need for these lifesaving dogs is astronomical.  Unfortunately there are only a handful of professional dogs trainers across the country who are producing quality diabetic alert dogs.  With Mary's intensive trainer training program and online trainer training videos she can reach a wider audience.  She can only personally work with so many people per year, but if she shares her skills with other trainers, her ability to reach those in need effectively spiderwebs across the world!  You can help make this possible!  With just 10 trainers per year enrolled in either the online video training series or coming to the intensive diabetic alert dog trainer training classes, you can help Mary increase the number of dogs produced by legitimate trainers by at least 50 dogs per year, effectively increasing the output of trained dogs by 25% in just the first year!  Thats 50 additional lives saved.  Thats 50 additional birthdays, 600 additional monthly visits to grandma and grandpas house and 18,250 days children get to wake up to their healthy parent smiling at them!  And thats just the trainer training program...</p>
<p>In the new commercial property, Mary will have enough room to easily record and edit training videos by herself.  Currently Mary has only a half completed diabetic alert dog training video series that helps around 5 people per month learn to train their own diabetic alert dog.  Having a completed video program will allow Mary to reach a larger audience, an audience who is in desperate need for help because they cannot pay $25,000 for a trained dog.  Despite being the top migraine alert dog trainer in the country, Mary has no online program for migraine alert dog training.  This new space will allow her to provide a video program for this quality-of-life stealing disability.  With a incredibly conservative estimate of 5 people per month utilizing the videos, in one year we could help 60 people gain back their quality of life.  Thats 60 people potentially returning to the workforce due to their new found freedom from migraines, thats 10,950 stories read to children when they are being tucked into bed and 21,900 sunsets enjoyed on a daily basis.</p>
<p>You can make these dreams a reality.  Mary has helped 115 people enjoy the little things in life every day.  Help her help more people to become happier, more productive, giving, loving members of society by ridding them of their pain, anguish and suffering.</p>

<p></p></div>","I am Michael Kronmiller, a Senior at the Bullis School, in Potomac, Maryland. My passion is robotics, particularly in aviation. Two years ago I began a project to design a technology to find people in avalanches. The region I chose to focus on was Nepal because of the need to apply advanced technologies to rescue methods.Not only did I want to design a technology to find people in avalanches, but also I wanted to help the areas affected by these catastrophes. With the help of a guide in Nepal we located Kanjirowa School whic was more than willing to work with us on the drone project. At the start of this campaign the students have received six drone kits with the help of Kashmir World Foundation, a U.S.-based organization that teaches students how to build drones.I am trying to raise money to support the most critical phase of my international collaborative STEM project that is aimed at developing sensor-equipped, small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) for rescues of avalanche victims in Nepal. The project is both educational and humanitarian.  Please see nepalrobotics.org.  Because the drones and sensors are costly and systems tests must be conducted at Mount Everest, my expenses are enormous.  Crowdfunding is crucially important, right now, because my final testing is coming up in March!  Avalanches in Nepal take lives and destroy homes, schools, businesses, and critical infrastructure—every year!  These events deal crippling blows to a national economy and remote localities that depend heavily on income from climbers and trekkers. Improved responses to avalanches will not only save lives, but also help people who greatly depend upon tourism in remote areas of Nepal.  This is where sensor-equipped sUAS for avalanche response can make a huge difference.  Contributions made now will help me with the most critical stage of research and development—on site tests of the full-scale prototype for the operational systems.  Moreover, funding for additional drone kits for high school students in Kathmandu will contribute to capacity-building, which promises to broaden and deepen Nepal’s nascent high tech efforts and thereby contribute to improving economic and social conditions in what is the fourth poorest country on earth.I need $30,000, to fund my March trip to Nepal and the new system. In addition to round trip air fare, I also need to cover guide fees, hotels and meals—and chartering helicopters, at least $4,000 to and from each remote test site.  My family, my school, and the Kashmir World Foundation have already invested well over $25,000 in equipment and the 2015 trip to Nepal for proof-of-concept flight testing at Kala Patthar, 1000 feet above Everest Base Camp, and in the Annapurna Region. Distinguished attorneys, who are experts in drone law and export licensing have generously contributed their indispensable efforts pro bono. Other advisers, all distinguished in their fields, have kindly contributed countless hours to this project.  They are identified on my website, nepalrobotics.org.
If I do not reach my entire funding goal, I will use what I receive to defray my project expenses.  Since the biggest, single expense will likely be helicopter chartering, contributions will pay for that, first.  After that, contributions will be aimed at the fare for the international flights, guides, hotels, local ground transportation, and food.  If there are medical expenses, I will cover those, myself.ALL DONATIONS TO THE PROJECT ARE TAX DEDUCTIBLE TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW (see: http://www.kashmirworldfoundation.org/#!donate/...)
I have to admit that this project is not like anything I have attempted, before.  When I came up with the idea, in December 2013, I had little idea of what I was going to face.  Getting this started was was not easy.  Assembling an advisory group of world-class experts was a big challenge.  Enlisting my brother was easy, but I had to ask a lot of him, including a journey to Nepal with me, for the flights of the early test models.  I should have done more, sooner, to enlist support from the public, but I really had my hands full with all the technical and management challenges.  Now that I am down to the wire for the final system tests in Nepal, I need that support and I need it soon.
I am the first to acknowledge the risks and obstacles.  Just getting to and from Nepal is not as simple as it might seem.  The world has a lot of tough places, and transiting some of them that lie between the U.S. and Nepal is potentially dangerous.  Before all that, I have to be sure my inoculations are up-to-date, I have to get my visa, and I have to be sure I have whatever U.S. export licenses and Nepal Government authorizations are required.  Things can go wrong at any one of those points, not to mention, when I get to Nepal.  Last trip, my brother became quite ill with acute gastroenteritis and acute mountain sickness, and had to be hospitalized.  The helicopter rides from Kathmandu to Kala Patthar and back were white knuckle experiences—but incredibly exciting.  I had more than a few hair raising moments on the roads and suspension bridges in remote areas, too.  But, the Kanjirowa School was a wonderful host, the guides were great professionals—and the homemade quadcopters flew!  One made it to over 19,000 feet from sea level.  It did have kind of an uncontrolled landing, but the damage was surprisingly slight.  You can see the videos at nepalrobotics.org.

We will get to the root of how violence, and especially violence against women, became embedded in the cultural code of Hip Hop and we will rewrite that code to work towards the liberation of all people, drawing upon the brilliance of feminist Hip Hop activism, artistry, and scholarship.Participants walk away with a greater understanding of the value of women in Hip Hop as a culture across disciplines.:  Art (Graffiti/StreetArt etc.), Dance, Technology (DJing/Music Production/Video), Words (Emceeing/FreeStyling/Writing/Rhyming/Poetry), and Culture (the Knowledge Element of reading, observing video and listening to audio media, discussion)Risks & ChallengesOne major risk to us achieving our goal of having a major youth presence is that the population we currently serve is considered in the ""low-income"" bracket and unable to afford the cost of entry to the conference.Other Ways You Can HelpMaybe you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:If you can donate supplies instead of money, that is also welcome.

So, just as you might join a fitness center to go exercise your body (and enjoy the juice bar after your work-out), we say, ""why not join a fitness center to exercise your creativity (and enjoy the coffee and cocktail bar during your work-out)?!"" </p><p>Clinical evidence now proves that exercising your creativity is just as important as exercising your body. In fact, exercising one’s creativity is good for the mind, body and the soul by helping:</p><ul>
<li>Reduce depression, boredom and anxiety</li>
<li>Encourage playfulness and sense of humor</li>
<li>Improve mental acuity and dexterity</li>
<li>Offer sensory stimulation and socialization</li>
<li>Increase self-esteem &amp; nurture spirituality</li>

<li>Studio space &amp; equipment (eg. soldering irons, glass cutters, sewing machines, die cutters, many materials)</li>
<li>Discounts on classes, workshops, and certain retreats &amp; events.</li>
<li>Discounts on food and beverages in the café</li>
<li>Belonging – you are always welcome here</li>
<li>Being an important part of a vital, supportive, creative community</li>
<li>The great satisfaction of investing in a worthy cause</li>
</ul><h1 align=""center""><i>Big Vision/Big Building</i></h1><p>Our VISION IS BIG - <i>Feeding the body as well as the soul</i>, requires big space for multiple endeavors. We were fortunate to find the perfect building in the perfect location: 35,000 cars drive by daily (great for a café), we are easy to find, and parking is plentiful. We are only two blocks from the mighty Mississippi River (in good weather, you can enjoy the river view while sipping coffee or something stronger on our outdoor patio) and one block from our historic downtown where, believe it or not, there was no high-end coffee shop until we opened one!  And while we believe no one should edit their dreams, we can easily acknowledge that few new arts organizations start by purchasing a building this big and refurbishing most of it.  It’s the perfect space.  And its cost is something we’d like help with from the community that benefits from it.</p><p><i>A side note on green intention:</i>  While our building may be big, we intend to maintain a small footprint. We care deeply about the environment and plan to use biodegradable and compostable cups, plastics and take-out containers, as well as earth-friendly paper goods and supplies. </p><p>Vendors have been chosen with care. For instance, we have chosen a local, small specialty coffee roaster: True Stone Coffee Roasters of St. Paul. Certified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America, they specialize in new-wave coffees and single-sourced beans. Their green-buying team sources exclusively from the world's finest small farms and cooperatives, allowing them to trace varietals, processing methods, labor conditions and unique ecological characteristics of every coffee they provide to us.</p><p>Also on our agenda is promoting re-use/recycling and repurposing as a goal in making art.  We have been blessed by donations of many supplies from manufacturers as well as private individuals; the stuff gets used here!  In the future, we plan to look for ways to support re-purpose artists as instructors and in a dedicated retail/e-commerce venture.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486149287/ldp2vgwaq39ktu2up9j7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2 align=""center""><i>Key Players</i></h2><p>Behind this vision is one bright, determined woman and a fabulous cadre of committed artists and community members, as well as organizational partners who help us share our purposeful work with target groups and other segments of the community. The owner of BreakAway Arts, Mecca Page, has tremendous passion and has worked tirelessly for the arts, sharing creative experiences and helping to build community. Since the conception of BreakAway Arts, Mecca has poured enormous energy and effort, not to mention her life-savings, into this vision.  </p><h3 align=""center"">
<i>Studio Level Arts School</i>   </h3><p>The lower Studio Level at BreakAway provides over 30 artist instructors with 6 different workshop/studio spaces. Classes and workshops are offered to adults, youth, and seniors in our community and include a wide variety of media such as painting, drawing, photography, digital art, fused &amp; stained glass, mosaics, fiber arts, jewelry-making, handmade paper, paper maché clay, pottery, creative writing, and much more! </p><p>A year ago, a registered Art Therapist joined our staff to design programs for caregivers, seniors and people with developmental disabilities.

While we pinched pennies every step of the way and did much of the work ourselves, these amazing transformations still cost over $300,000.</p><p>The architectural drawing shows the kitchen design and café/art gallery layout as well as the outdoor café patio and existing administrative offices. Transforming an old bank lobby into a beautiful, bistro-style café with a commercial kitchen took great imagination, way too many plumbers and electricians, enormous effort and more time than anticipated. (Our plumbing bid was nearly double our initial estimate because of the amazing depth of the concrete floor). Delays have eaten away at much of the funds designated for these final expenses.  It also left a notable trail of debt in its wake.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461880717/IMG_2293_1_ucyj1f.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 465.333px;height: 349px;""/></p><p>Construction delays (aren’t there always?), costs substantially higher than original bids, and kitchen design and equipment changes, added a pile of money to the project and held up the café opening by over six months.  And then? all the hoop-jumping necessitated by city and regional government regulations, and the associated fees/assessments added even more to the bill. The result?  We find ourselves in need of reaching out beyond our inner circle to ask for financial support to keep moving forward.</p><h3 align=""center""><i>Replacing the Front Doors, Already!</i></h3><p>This is good news!  We have had over 6000 visitors since the café opened, and the old rotunda doors at the entrance of the café have literally worn out their hinges.  Replacing them will have a big price tag – in the neighborhood of $10,000 – but it’s necessary for safety and security, as well as for an important Minnesota factor: climate control.  We don’t want to waste money heating or cooling the street corner. We've managed to find a local machinist willing to rebuild the doors for about $1,500. But this is only a temporary fix.</p><h3 align=""center""><i>Completing the Ceramic Studio</i></h3><p>Pottery classes are in hot demand.  Our first year, we rented studio time from a local potter.  This was a challenge in terms of schedule conflicts both for class time and kiln time.  We are ready to convert one of our studios to include a pottery wheel, and to retro-fit our utility area with a modest kiln.  This will enable us to put our pottery instructors to work, and allow them to keep the process in-house, which excites all of us!  We have several potential opportunities to share this resource with at-risk kids, but must first make it a reality.  The basic cost of this is close to $10,000.  Any contribution that off-sets this expense brings us closer to having an active ceramics program for everyone!</p><h3 align=""center""><i>Next Steps</i></h3><p>We’ve learned so much!  BreakAway’s studio/educational facility has been in operation for 18 months now.  It started with a core community of instructors and interested people and a whirlwind of classes and activities. Over the past summer, the focus of the organization and its staff turned to opening the café.  This stalled some program development, and substantially interrupted the calendar of classes, due to heavy construction interference and noise.  Yet, while course offerings and attendance were heavily reduced, there was a great deal of planning going on.  The internal think tank chugged away on ideas for senior programming, other opportunities for target groups, the pros &amp; cons of non-profit status, and creating a green initiative for environmentally-conscious artists.  We also reached out to numerous organizations in the community and forged new partnerships. </p><p>Happily, our class calendar is ramping back up, including classes offered off-site on contract with the local YMCA and the local public library, and special sessions with seniors at a variety of venues.  With those things humming along, we’re ready to look at new ventures, focus on new class opportunities including series classes for more advanced skill-building, and collaborations that take us beyond visual arts and into performance, personal and group development, and community projects.</p><h2 align=""center""><i>Reaching Beyond Our Community</i></h2><p>Helping to settle the expenses of our building improvements will ensure that BreakAway Arts not only continues to serve our community well, but has a chance to broaden its impact beyond this community.  As we said before, we are breaking new ground by taking the fitness center business model and applying it to the arts.  Our unique combination of services: an arts school, art gallery and café bring together all the essential elements to provide the perfect place <i>to feed the body as well as the soul</i>.  There is nothing like it. But more importantly, we hope that our Center for Creativity becomes a model for other communities and that we help Hastings become a magnet for the arts.</p><h2 align=""center""><i>What You Can Do</i></h2><p>Contribute to this campaign.  Share your love of arts and community by supporting BreakAway with a capital contribution, large or small.   Every donation helps.</p><ul>

</div></div>","Our StoryBreakAway was conceived as a vital community hub for gathering, creativity, art appreciation and education, collaboration, and good food and drink.  The café, which was the final step toward the vision of feeding the body as well as the soul, opened in late October 2016.Located at the foot of the iconic Hastings Bridge and just one block from Hastings’ historic downtown, our 8500 square foot building, erected as a bank in 1957, is a wonderful example of mid-century architecture, ideally suited for our unique array of activities.The café is already establishing itself as a destination for meeting and dining, and a hot spot for open mic music and poetry, author readings, rotating exhibits, improv and other performances.  We welcome facility reservations for special events, weddings/receptions, parties and large meetings.Fitness Center Business ModelWe decided to do something never done quite like this before by taking the fitness center business model and applying it to the arts with a café twist. So, just as you might join a fitness center to go exercise your body (and enjoy the juice bar after your work-out), we say, ""why not join a fitness center to exercise your creativity (and enjoy the coffee and cocktail bar during your work-out)?!"" Clinical evidence now proves that exercising your creativity is just as important as exercising your body. In fact, exercising one’s creativity is good for the mind, body and the soul by helping:
Reduce depression, boredom and anxiety
Encourage playfulness and sense of humor
Improve mental acuity and dexterity
Offer sensory stimulation and socialization
Increase self-esteem & nurture spirituality
We encourage people to be members, because it’s a mutual investment and commitment.  When you’re a member, you’re committing to yourself and the organization, just like at the gym.  Benefits both ways.  So, for a small monthly fee, members enjoy great benefits: 
Studio space & equipment (eg. soldering irons, glass cutters, sewing machines, die cutters, many materials)
Discounts on classes, workshops, and certain retreats & events.
Discounts on food and beverages in the café
Belonging – you are always welcome here
Being an important part of a vital, supportive, creative community
The great satisfaction of investing in a worthy cause
Big Vision/Big BuildingOur VISION IS BIG - Feeding the body as well as the soul, requires big space for multiple endeavors. We were fortunate to find the perfect building in the perfect location: 35,000 cars drive by daily (great for a café), we are easy to find, and parking is plentiful. We are only two blocks from the mighty Mississippi River (in good weather, you can enjoy the river view while sipping coffee or something stronger on our outdoor patio) and one block from our historic downtown where, believe it or not, there was no high-end coffee shop until we opened one!  And while we believe no one should edit their dreams, we can easily acknowledge that few new arts organizations start by purchasing a building this big and refurbishing most of it.  It’s the perfect space.  And its cost is something we’d like help with from the community that benefits from it.A side note on green intention:  While our building may be big, we intend to maintain a small footprint. We care deeply about the environment and plan to use biodegradable and compostable cups, plastics and take-out containers, as well as earth-friendly paper goods and supplies. Vendors have been chosen with care. For instance, we have chosen a local, small specialty coffee roaster: True Stone Coffee Roasters of St. Paul. Certified by the Specialty Coffee Association of America, they specialize in new-wave coffees and single-sourced beans. Their green-buying team sources exclusively from the world's finest small farms and cooperatives, allowing them to trace varietals, processing methods, labor conditions and unique ecological characteristics of every coffee they provide to us.Also on our agenda is promoting re-use/recycling and repurposing as a goal in making art.  We have been blessed by donations of many supplies from manufacturers as well as private individuals; the stuff gets used here!  In the future, we plan to look for ways to support re-purpose artists as instructors and in a dedicated retail/e-commerce venture.Key PlayersBehind this vision is one bright, determined woman and a fabulous cadre of committed artists and community members, as well as organizational partners who help us share our purposeful work with target groups and other segments of the community. The owner of BreakAway Arts, Mecca Page, has tremendous passion and has worked tirelessly for the arts, sharing creative experiences and helping to build community. Since the conception of BreakAway Arts, Mecca has poured enormous energy and effort, not to mention her life-savings, into this vision.  
Studio Level Arts School   The lower Studio Level at BreakAway provides over 30 artist instructors with 6 different workshop/studio spaces. Classes and workshops are offered to adults, youth, and seniors in our community and include a wide variety of media such as painting, drawing, photography, digital art, fused & stained glass, mosaics, fiber arts, jewelry-making, handmade paper, paper maché clay, pottery, creative writing, and much more! A year ago, a registered Art Therapist joined our staff to design programs for caregivers, seniors and people with developmental disabilities. We are currently reaching out to nursing homes, assisted living facilities and senior centers as well as collaborating with our local Veterans Home.  We have also started a Meetup Group called The Creative Crones of BreakAway Arts. This group of wise women gather regularly to encourage learning and sharing through self-discovery and empowerment.  They have a drumming circle and meet bi-weekly to “Stitch, Bitch & Wine” (yes, spelled like that). Help Us Stay the Course!Paying Off the Big Bills of Building UpgradesRenovations to the building included adding a commercial kitchen, creating a cafe'/art gallery dining space, building 5 workshop spaces in the studio level, adding a patio for outdoor seating, painting some exterior surfaces and adding exterior signage. While we pinched pennies every step of the way and did much of the work ourselves, these amazing transformations still cost over $300,000.The architectural drawing shows the kitchen design and café/art gallery layout as well as the outdoor café patio and existing administrative offices. Transforming an old bank lobby into a beautiful, bistro-style café with a commercial kitchen took great imagination, way too many plumbers and electricians, enormous effort and more time than anticipated. (Our plumbing bid was nearly double our initial estimate because of the amazing depth of the concrete floor). Delays have eaten away at much of the funds designated for these final expenses.  It also left a notable trail of debt in its wake.Construction delays (aren’t there always?), costs substantially higher than original bids, and kitchen design and equipment changes, added a pile of money to the project and held up the café opening by over six months.  And then? all the hoop-jumping necessitated by city and regional government regulations, and the associated fees/assessments added even more to the bill. The result?  We find ourselves in need of reaching out beyond our inner circle to ask for financial support to keep moving forward.Replacing the Front Doors, Already!This is good news!  We have had over 6000 visitors since the café opened, and the old rotunda doors at the entrance of the café have literally worn out their hinges.  Replacing them will have a big price tag – in the neighborhood of $10,000 – but it’s necessary for safety and security, as well as for an important Minnesota factor: climate control.  We don’t want to waste money heating or cooling the street corner. We've managed to find a local machinist willing to rebuild the doors for about $1,500. But this is only a temporary fix.Completing the Ceramic StudioPottery classes are in hot demand.  Our first year, we rented studio time from a local potter.  This was a challenge in terms of schedule conflicts both for class time and kiln time.  We are ready to convert one of our studios to include a pottery wheel, and to retro-fit our utility area with a modest kiln.  This will enable us to put our pottery instructors to work, and allow them to keep the process in-house, which excites all of us!  We have several potential opportunities to share this resource with at-risk kids, but must first make it a reality.  The basic cost of this is close to $10,000.  Any contribution that off-sets this expense brings us closer to having an active ceramics program for everyone!Next StepsWe’ve learned so much!  BreakAway’s studio/educational facility has been in operation for 18 months now.  It started with a core community of instructors and interested people and a whirlwind of classes and activities. Over the past summer, the focus of the organization and its staff turned to opening the café.  This stalled some program development, and substantially interrupted the calendar of classes, due to heavy construction interference and noise.  Yet, while course offerings and attendance were heavily reduced, there was a great deal of planning going on.  The internal think tank chugged away on ideas for senior programming, other opportunities for target groups, the pros & cons of non-profit status, and creating a green initiative for environmentally-conscious artists.  We also reached out to numerous organizations in the community and forged new partnerships. Happily, our class calendar is ramping back up, including classes offered off-site on contract with the local YMCA and the local public library, and special sessions with seniors at a variety of venues.  With those things humming along, we’re ready to look at new ventures, focus on new class opportunities including series classes for more advanced skill-building, and collaborations that take us beyond visual arts and into performance, personal and group development, and community projects.Reaching Beyond Our CommunityHelping to settle the expenses of our building improvements will ensure that BreakAway Arts not only continues to serve our community well, but has a chance to broaden its impact beyond this community.  As we said before, we are breaking new ground by taking the fitness center business model and applying it to the arts.  Our unique combination of services: an arts school, art gallery and café bring together all the essential elements to provide the perfect place to feed the body as well as the soul.  There is nothing like it. But more importantly, we hope that our Center for Creativity becomes a model for other communities and that we help Hastings become a magnet for the arts.What You Can DoContribute to this campaign.  Share your love of arts and community by supporting BreakAway with a capital contribution, large or small.   Every donation helps.

<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">OUR IMMEDIATE GOAL - Finding (y)Our voice:</span><br/></p></span></h3>The $150,000 will be used in support of our current operating budget, allowing us to continue building the capacity and infrastructure we need to advance our planning and prepare for a successful capital campaign. This sounds dreadfully boring and uninspired, but actually represents a critical step in the emergent life cycle of a growing nonprofit. <br/><br/>We’re in the delicate stage between planning and programming that can sometimes be a no-man’s land in the world of fundraising. Funders want results, but are hesitant to fund the infrastructure that produces them. Your contributions will not only help us bridge that gap between planning and programming, but help us demonstrate a broad-based support for the project, both local and national. <br/><br/>That’s the real power of crowd-funding - it’s not <i>just</i> about the money; it’s about the voices behind it. And collectively, your voices will have an enormous impact on our ongoing fundraising efforts.<br/><br/><b>OUR LONG TERM GOALS...<br/><br/></b>Today, the Rabbit hOle is busy developing design prototypes and modeling programs to help demonstrate the many facets of our forthcoming vision so that foundations and donors and the public can better understand what we’re planning, and what it is we’re talking about when we say “the world’s first ExploraStorium”. To accomplish this, we have to build the organization at the same time, so we spend a lot of our time cultivating and fundraising as well. We're building the plane and flying it at the same time...<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we’re actively searching for a permanent home, a building in Kansas City at a scale between 50,000 and 80,000 square feet. The acquisition of that building will signal the beginning of our capital phase, and implementation of the full vision.<br/><br/>So in the long run, we’re really talking about millions of dollars, and something like a three-year plan to realize the Rabbit hOle’s full measure. We could have set our Indiegogo goal in the millions, and maybe we should have. But again, the Indiegogo is about more than just money. It’s about building the vision from the ground up.<br/><br/>There’s nothing quite like the Rabbit hOle anywhere in the world. And the fact is, if you want to give us more money - you can! And we want you to! We have stretch goals that stretch from Kansas City to New York and back again, and they’re very specific. If we crest the $150,000 mark, we’ll roll them out for you with gusto. And if there’s anyone out there who would like to foot the entire bill and get this thing rolling on the fast-track, please note our $12 million perk. (Paul Allen, we know you’re out there...)<br/>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div></div>","Why? Because the history and culture of literature among young people is vast and beautiful, and goes largely uncelebrated. And because the future of literacy depends on it. 
We can’t win the fight for readers without celebrating, supporting, and advancing the culture that nourishes them. Without it, the joy and wonder of books are diminished, and reading becomes a compulsory act.

The Rabbit hOle is a visionary nonprofit center for the children’s book chartered to create new and extraordinary encounters with literature that will revitalize the culture of reading for generations to come. With your help, we can open up new worlds and create greater access to literature by building a new kind of portal that embraces readers and non-readers alike, and provides a new way for children and adults to rediscover the joy and wonder of books, together.


FROM REPTILE TO RABBIT HOLE: The Rabbit hOle is the brainchild of Pete Cowdin and Debbie Pettid, artists and operators of Kansas City’s beloved Reading Reptile, a celebrated children’s bookstore and cultural center of 28 years. As founders and directors of The Rabbit hOle, they bring with them a wealth of knowledge, experience and many friends, both local and national, uniquely suited to the project. 




  







The Rabbit hOle is working directly with local partners and the publishing industry to realize its vision. A legion of award-winning authors and illustrators have committed to help in any way they can - and many already are. Our current national advisory board includes some of the most distinguished writers and illustrators in the world.














www.rabbitholekc.org/indiegogo-illustrations










OUR IMMEDIATE GOAL - Finding (y)Our voice:The $150,000 will be used in support of our current operating budget, allowing us to continue building the capacity and infrastructure we need to advance our planning and prepare for a successful capital campaign. This sounds dreadfully boring and uninspired, but actually represents a critical step in the emergent life cycle of a growing nonprofit. We’re in the delicate stage between planning and programming that can sometimes be a no-man’s land in the world of fundraising. Funders want results, but are hesitant to fund the infrastructure that produces them. Your contributions will not only help us bridge that gap between planning and programming, but help us demonstrate a broad-based support for the project, both local and national. That’s the real power of crowd-funding - it’s not just about the money; it’s about the voices behind it. And collectively, your voices will have an enormous impact on our ongoing fundraising efforts.OUR LONG TERM GOALS...Today, the Rabbit hOle is busy developing design prototypes and modeling programs to help demonstrate the many facets of our forthcoming vision so that foundations and donors and the public can better understand what we’re planning, and what it is we’re talking about when we say “the world’s first ExploraStorium”. To accomplish this, we have to build the organization at the same time, so we spend a lot of our time cultivating and fundraising as well. We're building the plane and flying it at the same time...Meanwhile, we’re actively searching for a permanent home, a building in Kansas City at a scale between 50,000 and 80,000 square feet. The acquisition of that building will signal the beginning of our capital phase, and implementation of the full vision.So in the long run, we’re really talking about millions of dollars, and something like a three-year plan to realize the Rabbit hOle’s full measure. We could have set our Indiegogo goal in the millions, and maybe we should have. But again, the Indiegogo is about more than just money. It’s about building the vision from the ground up.There’s nothing quite like the Rabbit hOle anywhere in the world. And the fact is, if you want to give us more money - you can! And we want you to! We have stretch goals that stretch from Kansas City to New York and back again, and they’re very specific. If we crest the $150,000 mark, we’ll roll them out for you with gusto. And if there’s anyone out there who would like to foot the entire bill and get this thing rolling on the fast-track, please note our $12 million perk. (Paul Allen, we know you’re out there...)


   

Story is the foundation upon which all culture relies. Reading and writing are the tools that enable us to access, share, and advance the stories that shape our culture. The better we are at using these tools, the more effective we are as human beings. 
The Rabbit hOle is in the business of facilitating more effective human beings...


...as a radical POINT OF ENTRY into literature that provides equal access to the culture of books to both readers and non-readers alike;...as an enduring PLATFORM for educators that consistently provides new opportunities to support standards and scaffold academic growth;...as a collaborative PARTNER with area libraries, schools, and a host of arts organizations both local and national;...as an ADVOCATE , a SANCTUARY and a MEGAPHONE for literacy concerns both local and national;...as a critical POINT OF CONTACT between young people and authors that will inspire countless children to find their own voices and stories;...as a CURATOR, reconnecting contemporary and historical practices so that the legacy of the children’s book as an art form can be more widely understood and advanced above and beyond its status as a commodity.
Even as we build and test the vision of the Rabbit hOle, we're already creating value in the community and bringing books to kids and adults in new ways...

   Why should you support us?
We are passionate about Dodgeball and want to pass that love for the game on a local, national and international level. This experience in Toronto will not only add to the credibility of Dodgeball, it will contribute to the growth of this amazing sport and community. This was only a dream to most of us a few months ago, and now our dream has come true! We love the sport more than
we did in school and can’t wait to make our city, province and country proud.
    What we need
Any amount of donation is greatly appreciated, and will go to travel and accommodations.

</p>
<h3><b>The
aim is to use the internet for global reach and informed impact.</b></h3>
<p>
Since
2009 Jeannette Ginslov has taught Screendance and AR workshops
internationally: USA, UK, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, Hong Kong, South America, Lithuania, Rwanda and South Africa. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">She had to raise funds
to travel to all these places, sometimes for very little payment or no fees for the workshops. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">However</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> Ginslov is passionate about sharing the art
form globally and wishes to use the internet to reach places like
Tunisia for example, where interest is growing in the screendance medium and where local artists cannot afford to pay for her flights and accommodation, let alone her fees for the workshops.</span></p>
<p><b>So accessibility
is a big issue!</b> In general Screendance and related digital media
subjects, such as AR and interactive media are taught at tertiary
level institutions or at exclusive one off workshops in major city
centres. At Ginslov Media Studio one can learn from home or a studio,
from a portable laptop or personal computer. As a long distance
platform it provides learning opportunities to students and
professionals living in far away places, giving them access to
information when they cannot afford to travel to workshops, let alone afford the costs of
the workshop. </p>
<p>With arts funding drying up, teaching online seems the
logical solution. Ginslov will create: </p>

<p>Screendance
and interactive performance are niche events for small audiences, but

more audiences than ever before. </p>
<p>With your help I can grow the medium

Media Studio provides easily accessible global online learning. It is
designed for digital media, dance and film practitioners, who wish to
learn about making dance for screen, using AR and interactive media.
The courses and masterclasses offer a rigorous exploration of dance
for camera, the use of key media tools including cameras, editing
software, lighting, sound, special effects, interactive media tools
(max/msp or Isadora) and DVD production.

With
webinars and face to face sessions, students receive expert
tuition with specialist digital media practitioners, who will share
their skills and knowledge about creating professional digital media
outcomes for performances, online, promotional or marketing purposes.

What You Get

Your
name and/or company logo will appear in the credit roll of the Intro
video and on the website. 
You
will be internationally recognised as supporting: a unique educational platform, a medium that is growing across the globe, its spread to remote areas across the globe.
A thank you on social media and a personal email
A 1 minute dance video inspired by the creation of this academy If she does not reach her entire goal she will persevere none the less and seek alternative means or collaborators to launch the academy    The Impact 

The
aim is to use the internet for global reach and informed impact.

Since
2009 Jeannette Ginslov has taught Screendance and AR workshops
internationally: USA, UK, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, Hong Kong, South America, Lithuania, Rwanda and South Africa. She had to raise funds
to travel to all these places, sometimes for very little payment or no fees for the workshops. 
However Ginslov is passionate about sharing the art
form globally and wishes to use the internet to reach places like
Tunisia for example, where interest is growing in the screendance medium and where local artists cannot afford to pay for her flights and accommodation, let alone her fees for the workshops.
So accessibility
is a big issue! In general Screendance and related digital media
subjects, such as AR and interactive media are taught at tertiary
level institutions or at exclusive one off workshops in major city
centres. At Ginslov Media Studio one can learn from home or a studio,
from a portable laptop or personal computer. As a long distance
platform it provides learning opportunities to students and
professionals living in far away places, giving them access to
information when they cannot afford to travel to workshops, let alone afford the costs of
the workshop. 
With arts funding drying up, teaching online seems the
logical solution. Ginslov will create: 


Private one on one live mentoring and coaching sessions
Webinars on choreographing for, filming and editing screendance 
Webinars on interactive media, animation and post production
Tailor made live-streaming screendance workshops and webinars
Masterclasses with world renowned specialists in screendance & digital media
Open Feedback Sessions 
Online Screening Room 
Dance Video Archive
Screendance and Digital Media Laboratory 
Hangout sessions with open/public feedback sessions 
Networking Page to facilitate networking and job creation
Links to University Departments teaching screendance & digital media
Library page - books, online articles, links
FAQ page


Risks and Challenges 



Screendance
and interactive performance are niche events for small audiences, but
with expanding online presence, digital media art forms are reaching
more audiences than ever before. 
With your help I can grow the medium
from the bottom up, from the niche to the mainstream.

I
have the grit and passion for long-term goals. These have given me
the ability to push through adversity, challenges and
setbacks to find new solutions and a pathway to success. I
welcome challenges and initiate problem solving solutions. Having
being in the arts industry for over 30 years I have experience in
making things work.

Other Ways You Can Help If you are unable to help financially please help spread the campaign using the  Indiegogo share tools and/or your social media pages.

<p>My name is Abby Williams and I have been a student scientist in the T.I.M.E. for Real Science program for 4 years. I have conducted research on a new invasive stink bug that is wreaking havoc on the southeastern United States by devastating soybean crops and invading homes in the winter.  My partner and I worked to find an effective environmentally friendly way to control this pest because they continue to re-infest crops and become resistant to the pesticide chemicals. We wanted to find the chemical components of their pheromone (chemicals used for communication within a species) that would be effective in a trap . We had to problem solve and create our own assays and became the first to discover an active chemical in their pheromone. We went to international competitions and won prizes! These experiences were inspirational to me and helped make me who I am today.</p>

<p><span>The TIME 4 Real Science Program is a unique grassroots STEM initiative that turns the preparation of tomorrow’s scientists upside down.  Traditionally, students learn science concepts in high school, learn more science concepts in college and then finally get to do real science in graduate school.  Most students never find out what it is to do real science, and opportunities are lost.  In the TIME program, twenty-four 9th - 12th graders spend over 250 hours during the school day, after school and in the summer conducting real research into questions of their own choosing that matter to them and our community as they contribute to the greater scientific knowledge base.  In the process they are supported by teachers and volunteer scientists as they learn techniques and content necessary to answer their questions.  They develop critical thinking and problem solving skills, learn to create, innovate, plan, communicate, use their resources and persist in their work.  The TIME program develops scientific entrepreneurs with a love for their community.</span></p>

<p><span>Over the past 7 years, 95 high school students have conducted innovative, authentic research on local topics including kudzu bug control, chestnut tree restoration, isolation of endophytes from local medicinal plants, and identification of endophytes that produce biofuels.  Scientists say that student work is on par with that of graduate students. Over the years, 21 TIME students have been awarded all expenses paid trips to represent North Carolina in national and international science competitions.  The TIME program has been essential in connecting students from successful elementary and middle school STEM programs to the greater STEM pipeline that spans high school and into college, keeping kids interested in science as a career.  A recent study of NC 9th graders found that only 4% go on to study STEM after high school.  In the TIME program, 70% of the students pursue STEM majors in college and careers after college.  </span></p>

<p>As a T.I.M.E. program graduate, I want to give other kids in my area the chance to experience what I have. Coming from a small town public school and competing with the school of math and science in our state is a big deal. We have been funded by a large grant from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund but that grant has run out. In order to keep this program going we must have funds for equipment, supplies and transportation. Your contributions will allow high school students in a public high school the chance to reach beyond a typical educational experience. They are able to find their own important questions and solve those problems on their own.<br/></p>

<p>We need to raise $12,000 to keep the program going in 2016-2017. If you contribute $1000 or more you will be “funding a student.” You will get updates on a student's project! You will be able to see who you have helped.</p>
<p>What we need to do is secure remaining funds needed for 2016-2017.  After that we will build an endowment that will fund the annual budget gap for many, many years to come. If we don't reach our entire goal, the money raised here will still have a significant impact on raising funds for the program!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will give you the chance to help a high school student get ahead in their life and possibly career track. This program has helped me significantly to build many skills that may not be developed in typical high school classrooms. It will also give you the opportunity to donate to students who may not have all of the privileges of kids conducting research in private schools.</p>

</div></div>","Help T.I.M.E. for Real Science continue into 2016-17! 

My name is Abby Williams and I have been a student scientist in the T.I.M.E. for Real Science program for 4 years. I have conducted research on a new invasive stink bug that is wreaking havoc on the southeastern United States by devastating soybean crops and invading homes in the winter.  My partner and I worked to find an effective environmentally friendly way to control this pest because they continue to re-infest crops and become resistant to the pesticide chemicals. We wanted to find the chemical components of their pheromone (chemicals used for communication within a species) that would be effective in a trap . We had to problem solve and create our own assays and became the first to discover an active chemical in their pheromone. We went to international competitions and won prizes! These experiences were inspirational to me and helped make me who I am today.
 




         

The TIME 4 Real Science Program is a unique grassroots STEM initiative that turns the preparation of tomorrow’s scientists upside down.  Traditionally, students learn science concepts in high school, learn more science concepts in college and then finally get to do real science in graduate school.  Most students never find out what it is to do real science, and opportunities are lost.  In the TIME program, twenty-four 9th - 12th graders spend over 250 hours during the school day, after school and in the summer conducting real research into questions of their own choosing that matter to them and our community as they contribute to the greater scientific knowledge base.  In the process they are supported by teachers and volunteer scientists as they learn techniques and content necessary to answer their questions.  They develop critical thinking and problem solving skills, learn to create, innovate, plan, communicate, use their resources and persist in their work.  The TIME program develops scientific entrepreneurs with a love for their community.


     

Over the past 7 years, 95 high school students have conducted innovative, authentic research on local topics including kudzu bug control, chestnut tree restoration, isolation of endophytes from local medicinal plants, and identification of endophytes that produce biofuels.  Scientists say that student work is on par with that of graduate students. Over the years, 21 TIME students have been awarded all expenses paid trips to represent North Carolina in national and international science competitions.  The TIME program has been essential in connecting students from successful elementary and middle school STEM programs to the greater STEM pipeline that spans high school and into college, keeping kids interested in science as a career.  A recent study of NC 9th graders found that only 4% go on to study STEM after high school.  In the TIME program, 70% of the students pursue STEM majors in college and careers after college.  
  


As a T.I.M.E. program graduate, I want to give other kids in my area the chance to experience what I have. Coming from a small town public school and competing with the school of math and science in our state is a big deal. We have been funded by a large grant from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund but that grant has run out. In order to keep this program going we must have funds for equipment, supplies and transportation. Your contributions will allow high school students in a public high school the chance to reach beyond a typical educational experience. They are able to find their own important questions and solve those problems on their own.


 
   What We Need & What You Get
The TIME for Real Science Program is a partnership between Transylvania County Schools and North Carolina Cooperative Extension (4H Youth Development). 
It is our belief that if students are given adequate Time to engage in true Inquiry into their own questions, and find that they and their new findings Matter to others, they will continue to Explore more opportunities in science. --The T.I.M.E. Partnership
The T.I.M.E. program was first funded in 2007 by a three year $180,000 Student Science Enrichment Program grant from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund awarded to TIME program co-director Mary Arnaudin, 4H Youth Development.  From 2010-2015, the program was again supported by Burroughs Wellcome, this time through the $175,000 Career Award for Science and Math Teachers awarded to TIME program co-director Jennifer Williams.  


     
Eight years of consistent funding was undoubtedly a huge contributing factor in the success of the T.I.M.E. program.  The bottom line is that doing and communicating real science is expensive.  However, students, alumni, parents, scientists, educators and the community all agree: this proven innovative program must be sustained not only for Transylvania County, but for its potential to be replicated in other schools.  It is a model of what education should be.
The 2015-2016 program year is currently funded by Transylvania County Schools and a generous $15,000 grant from the Duke Energy Foundation.  Additional donations over the years from multiple community organizations and individuals have helped to make this program year possible.  

                                                                                                                
The application period for the 2016-2017 program year will begin soon.  We currently have a $12,000 budget gap for 2016-2017 and are looking to fill this gap by getting the word out to our supporters.  Do you value this program?  Do you want to see it continue?  If so, please donate and encourage your friends and family to donate!
While our primary goal for this Indiegogo campaign is to raise the money necessary for the program to continue into 2016-2017, we also have the following stretch goals.  Additional funds raised over and above $12,000 will be used to:


fund the budget gap for future program years
invite in teachers from other schools to learn about our research program

build an endowment to fund the current budget gap into the future
purchase specialized equipment (see examples in the photos below) necessary for unique student research ideas to become feasible projects

       <b>A little bit of
background</b></p>
<p><b><i>Unstressed Surf School </i></b>is an initiative of<b> <i>Friends
of Chintsa</i> -</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-profit organisation</b> operating since
2008 in the Chintsa area just outside East London in the Eastern Cape, South
Africa.  Every weekend (weather permitting), a small number of local
volunteers (myself included) meet with a group of Xhosa youngsters for a
morning of sea, sun and surf.  Most of <i>Unstressed’s</i> members
come from <b>challenging socio-economic

<p>The
lifeguard course will be run by the <b><i>East London Surf Lifesavers Club</i></b> who
have generously given us a discount on the course fee.  It is being held
in East London (a costly 45 km from Chintsa) from the end of October 2015
through to the beginning of 2016.  It involves both theory and practical
training - which invariably leaves these lifeguard hopefuls with a massive
appetite!  I am providing additional support with logistics and
training as well as extra tutoring (as the course work is in English and not
isiXhosa – their first language) to help the trainees successfully pass the
final lifeguarding test.  Finally we are ensuring that Anele,
Gana, Lulama and Sandile have suitable kit to train and work in.</p>
<p><b>         Challenges

<p>Supporting

Unstressed Surf School.  If we don’t raise enough, we will draw from funds
allocated from other <i>Unstressed </i>activities. 
We have now raised more than the minimum – which is great!  Any additional funds raised will support the Lifeguards’ work experience.  If we raise even
more, funds will go back into Unstressed to support the daily running and
activities that have, over the past five years, been developing awesome young
Xhosa surfers and future lifeguards.</p>
<p>Both
the theoretical and practical components of the lifeguard training will
invariably be tough – after all, we need to be able to rescue someone from the

in translation and that they have enough nutrition for brain and muscle power

<p>Even
if some of the surfers don’t pass the final lifeguard test; the knowledge,

<b>We let YOU choose where you get your books from</b><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p> <p>If you look at today's e-reading market there are limited options for avid readers. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">E-readers based on E-Ink technology offer the most comfortable reading experience (no eye fatigue, perfect reading indoors, outdoors and even in bright sunlight, long battery life). However, most e-readers sold (Kindle, Kobo) lock you into their company's ecosystem, forcing you to buy books with them. Their business model is about getting customers into their system and making money on lifetime e-book sales.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">New and innovative ways of reading books based on e-book subscriptions (for instance Scribd, Skoobe, Mobifo, Bliyoo) and library apps are growing rapidly in the last years as people come to realize that they prefer to have access to many books but at a fixed price per month. This is similar to the rise of apps such as Spotify and Netflix. These all you  can read apps however can not be used with those mainstream e-readers. </span><br/></p>
<p>From the moment <b>Icarus</b> was launched in the e-reading market in 2010, our philosophy has been the opposite: the choice where to get books from should always be with the reader and never with the manufacturer. That is why our e-readers have been 'open' from the start, supporting open standards and not based on lock-in systems. In 2014 we have moved to the Android operating system for our e-readers, which enables them to run <i>all reading apps on the market today - and in the future</i>. With an Icarus e-reader you can buy books in your favorite web shop, download free books, read via All-You-Can-Read subscriptions and more.</p>

<h3>The all new Illumina XL 8"" Android e-reader</h3>
<p>Based on our successful Illumina 6"" e-readers, Icarus is proud to present the all new Illumina XL:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446036290/ilyylbhyrzb4njyqrfps.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Illumina XL is compact, lightweight and comfortable to hold, despite its 8 inch E-Ink screen. This screen size is equivalent to a paperback paper book, the most popular format for reading in the world. Thanks to the slim bezel, 9mm thickness and one-button design (home button) we managed to keep the dimensions to a minimum. Weighing 275 grams, it weighs only 75 grams more than much smaller 6"" devices.</p>
<p>The 8 inch screen offers 75% more screen surface, so more content fits on one page (meaning you need to flip pages less than with traditional 6"" e-readers). Or you can increase the font size to make reading more comfortable.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446045440/lhfizary7tpqp0a9jgtj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>The integrated front light enables comfortable reading even in low light situations and of course the XL has a touchscreen, Wi-Fi and plenty of storage for your books.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What makes the Illumina XL truly unique, it its compatibility with all e-book platforms. From e-book web shops to all-you-can-read subscriptions, from public libraries to public domain books and more. </span><br/></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why would I not just read on my phone or tablet?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> For casual reading on the go you could use a phone or tablet. But only E-Ink devices offer you a comfortable reading experience if you are reading for longer periods as the screen does not lead to eye fatigue. Also if you want to read outside on a LCD screen this is very difficult due to the reflections. If you are serious about reading, the best device to do so on is an e-reader.</p>

Update 19th of November: slightly delayed but shipping before Christmas
Unfortunately we are slightly delayed due to a delay in shipment of a key component by one of our suppliers, but we will be able to ship in time for Christmas.

We let YOU choose where you get your books from

 If you look at today's e-reading market there are limited options for avid readers. E-readers based on E-Ink technology offer the most comfortable reading experience (no eye fatigue, perfect reading indoors, outdoors and even in bright sunlight, long battery life). However, most e-readers sold (Kindle, Kobo) lock you into their company's ecosystem, forcing you to buy books with them. Their business model is about getting customers into their system and making money on lifetime e-book sales.
New and innovative ways of reading books based on e-book subscriptions (for instance Scribd, Skoobe, Mobifo, Bliyoo) and library apps are growing rapidly in the last years as people come to realize that they prefer to have access to many books but at a fixed price per month. This is similar to the rise of apps such as Spotify and Netflix. These all you  can read apps however can not be used with those mainstream e-readers. 
From the moment Icarus was launched in the e-reading market in 2010, our philosophy has been the opposite: the choice where to get books from should always be with the reader and never with the manufacturer. That is why our e-readers have been 'open' from the start, supporting open standards and not based on lock-in systems. In 2014 we have moved to the Android operating system for our e-readers, which enables them to run all reading apps on the market today - and in the future. With an Icarus e-reader you can buy books in your favorite web shop, download free books, read via All-You-Can-Read subscriptions and more.




The all new Illumina XL 8"" Android e-reader
Based on our successful Illumina 6"" e-readers, Icarus is proud to present the all new Illumina XL:



The Illumina XL is compact, lightweight and comfortable to hold, despite its 8 inch E-Ink screen. This screen size is equivalent to a paperback paper book, the most popular format for reading in the world. Thanks to the slim bezel, 9mm thickness and one-button design (home button) we managed to keep the dimensions to a minimum. Weighing 275 grams, it weighs only 75 grams more than much smaller 6"" devices.
The 8 inch screen offers 75% more screen surface, so more content fits on one page (meaning you need to flip pages less than with traditional 6"" e-readers). Or you can increase the font size to make reading more comfortable.





The integrated front light enables comfortable reading even in low light situations and of course the XL has a touchscreen, Wi-Fi and plenty of storage for your books.
What makes the Illumina XL truly unique, it its compatibility with all e-book platforms. From e-book web shops to all-you-can-read subscriptions, from public libraries to public domain books and more. 



Out-of-the box our Illumina XL e-reader - running on Android 4.2 - can run apps from all reading platforms, such as Scribd, Skoobe, Kindle, Kobo, Mobifo, Bliyoo and many more. Public libraries have Android reading apps to, so with our e-readers you can also lend books at your library. If you own a library of books of a closed ecosystem already (for instance Kindle) you can easily access it on the Illumina using the Kindle app. By using cloud storage apps like Dropbox (pre-installed) or others, you can access your library stored in the cloud.

Below you find some screenshots of apps running on the Illumina XL:



The Illumina XL is also future proof: as Android is the dominant mobile device operating system you can rest assured that any future reading app will be available on Android.

The inspiration behind Studio Samuel

When I brought home my son, Niko
Samuel (pronounced sam-well), the concept of Studio Samuel was born. My experiences visiting Ethiopia during the adoption
process were eye opening, realizing the insurmountable need of
those living in dire
poverty. What was particularly unsettling to see were the barriers women faced
on a regular basis– access to education &
healthcare, child marriage, forced labor, human trafficking, abuse and more. The images and stories would be forever ingrained in my mind. You can't walk away from that.


 Studio Samuel opened doors in the capital city, Addis Ababa, and Training for Tomorrow officially launched with 25 girls and their caregivers. Training for Tomorrow is our trademarked program, which brings an innovative approach to teaching the Ten Core Life Skills, as established by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNESCO, UNICEF and more. 
Part of this innovative approach includes computer programming. Everything changed following our students' participation in Africa Code Week this year. This was it!

A Training for Tomorrow graduate is armed with the  life skills to stand on her own. The added value of being skilled in an industry proven to have a significant growth rate, globally, is life-changing for girls in our program. No matter the size of your contribution, each person supporting our campaign is playing a vital role in altering the future path of a girl otherwise facing vulnerable, limited and sometimes dangerous employment options.
  
How does our Training for Tomorrow coding center work?
We train 35 girls  (eventually 100) all living at, or below, the poverty line. Computer Science majors and professors from a local university mentor our students in the lab. Students are challenged with projects based on skill-sets and work with their teams to create solutions.   What We Need & What You GetWe need to raise $10,000USD to expand our computer lab at our training center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Here is what we can cover with your support:
Expansion of our current lab to accommodate classes of 20 students in one session.
Provide 5 more laptops for the center and more wiring.
Purchase equipment for the classroom i.e ( projector, chairs, tables, white boards)
Provide stipend for IT students and professors leading the class.

 The Perks!
Fair Trade Ethiopian coffee (the best!) in soft, raw cotton bags signed by Julian Lennon (photographer, philanthropist, musician and Studio Samuel Advisor)
Portraits of select Training for Tomorrow students, shot at our compound by talented photographer, John Delaney with handwritten lyrics by Julian Lennon
Studio Samuel signature jewelry locally made in Ethiopia from melted artillery trade beads with artisans receiving fair wages & healthcare
...and more perks coming in from our music industry friends lending their support - Elvis Costello signed guitar, Jason Aldean signed guitar, Joseph Arthur painting, Soundgarden framed show poster (signed by all members) and more...
    The Impact of Training for Tomorrow

                                        


""Organizations like Studio Samuel Foundation are critical to helping educate women and giving them the skills and confidence to improve their livelihoods and those of their families.""   - Sheryl WuDunn | co-creator of A Path Appears and Half the Sky Movement
