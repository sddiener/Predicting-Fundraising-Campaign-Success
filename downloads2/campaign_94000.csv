<h3>A Bit About the Project</h3>
<p>Hello! Austin Ledzian and I are photographers and design students at Virginia Tech, and we have spent the past few months interviewing and photographing women farmers in southwest Virginia. We focused on our pocket of Appalachia because it’s a region that has been relevant to our lives for the past four years as students.</p>
<p>Our initial inspiration for this project began at the Blacksburg Farmers market, where our preconceived notions of a male-dominated agricultural realm were challenged.  We immediately were drawn to the local farming movements, focusing specifically on representation of women. We wanted to know what it meant to be a woman in agriculture, especially in a region where stereotypes and male representation dominate. We want to share their stories.</p>
<p><i>For a further look at the series, please visit our website, <strong><a href=""http://www.wfarmers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wfarmers.com</a></strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $1800 for the execution of this project, set to show on July 29 at the Palisades Restaurant in Eggleston, VA. We decided to show first here, because this farm-to-table restaurant sources only locally grown and raised goods, and it is geographically relevant to the women we met. Once the photographs are printed we would like to show in other locations throughout Appalachia.</p>
<p>The exhibit comprises 25 photographs: 20 27”x34” prints and 5 54”x68” prints. Then the funds raised will go towards printing to make the exhibit happen. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how we will use the $1800:</p>
<ul>
<li>$250: Professionally scanned film negatives (25 negatives total)</li>
<li>$900: Photographic paper for the archival prints</li>
<li>$500: Ink for printing</li>
<li>$150: Installation supplies (clips, wood, cord, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perks</strong>: This is a documentary photographic series, so the perks are pieces of art! Each size is an edition of 10. By pre-ordering a print through this campaign you will receive a 15% discount. All photographs can be seen in the gallery section of our website, <strong><i><a href=""http://www.wfarmers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wfarmers.com</a>. </i></strong></p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Obstacles</h3>
<p>An alarm goes off: it’s 4:00am. Austin and I throw our coats on and gather our equipment. We rush to get on the road, where we drive for two hours—all so we can catch the first rays of light and morning rounds on the farm. Rinse, repeat. Expect your camera to malfunction. Expect it to be raining. And expect to walk through cow s**t in 20 degree weather.</p>
<p>This became our routine from the latter months of 2016 to early 2017, all while navigating our class schedules. Austin and I had to plan early morning sessions in order to make it back for our 9:00 AM’s, or afternoon sessions before the sun went down. Missing one chance to shoot could mean we miss a bloom or a harvest, a challenge we met every week. Schedules revolved around the women we wanted to learn from, and nothing every really went as planned on the farm.</p>
<p>We restricted ourselves to using analogue film, the only photographic medium we felt did justice to the intense manual labor of these women. Therein lay a challenge—not knowing if the photos were good until we got them developed, photographing situations that already had little margin for error, and adding time to the already lengthy process. The photos were blemished by the analog process, and we celebrate these blemishes. </p>
<p>The experience humbled us and motivated us to refine and improve our process with each shoot. At times it was messy, but we learned immensely from our time spent on and off the farm with these incredible women.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Over the past few months, we have made five new friends. The project allowed us to connect with incredible women farmers in our community that we may not have crossed paths with in our daily lives. By supporting this project, you are supporting the reason there is food on your table. This project is to shed light on a population that doesn’t garner widespread representation. To support this project is to appreciate local farming, the women that make up the fabric of agricultural history, and the stories they have to tell.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>How You Can Support</h3>

In the meantime, appreciate your local farms and farmers.

<h3>Hidden Women: The Lampshade Project</h3>
<p>Wouldn't it be great if there were more women artists represented in major museums? Donate a little and you have a chance to help make that happen. My name is Jenny Ashley--I'm an emerging fine art photographer from San Luis Obispo, CA with my first solo exhibition coming up March 6 through May 12, 2020 for International Women's Day at Cultural Center Tijuana. The exhibit will include 20  large scale 40"" x 60"" archival photographs from Hidden Women: The Lampshade Project, a subversive fine art series that confronts the audacity of how women are overlooked, objectified, silenced and even made to feel replaceable. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How to Support the Project</h3>
<p>Thankfully, the cost of fine art printing is substantially less in Mexico. And the museum is graciously covering half the expenses of printing the exhibition and catalogue. But that still leaves $5000 to pull together to make this large scale exhibition happen. </p>
<p>Ways to Support the Project:</p>
<p><strong>Donate $250</strong> to sponsor the printing of one 40"" x 60"" archival fine art print and you will receive a signed 11"" x 14"" photograph (chosen by the artist) and two signed and numbered exhibition catalogues </p>
<p><strong>Donate $100</strong> to sponsor the printing of 5 exhibition catalogues </p>
<p><strong>Donate $20</strong> to sponsor the printing of 1 exhibition catalogue (pre-order a catalogue) </p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, the drawing will still take place and the project will still proceed (but just with fewer prints in the exhibition). <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this fundraiser if you have friends who are interested in supporting emerging artists, women in the arts, women in business, art as resistance, art and feminism, gender equity, women and gender studies or fine art photography. </p>

<p>Hey everyone, my name is Allen Henson.  I am a photographer and filmmaker; I call
Brooklyn, New York home.  What originally
began as a hobby, after my time spent as an infantryman in the Army, has become
something more than I could have ever expected. 
After five years of hard work I am happy to say that now is the time to
compile a selection of my photographs into a book. <br/></p>
<p>This book is not just a compilation of visually
appealing images, but serves as a vehicle and a means to further fund our overall
goals at Allen Henson Productions.<span>  With
the help of you guys, this can be the next step in the direction of eliminating
artistic censorship. (eh hem, instagram) Your contributions
will enable the production of this book, which provides the unique and never
before seen perspective of a U.S. Veteran in the current dialogue of senseless censorship
in ""modern"" America.  In supporting the
creation of this book, you will not only be taking a stance on
censorship, but purchasing one kick-ass piece for the bookshelf, bathroom, or
coffee table. </span></p>
<p>In this era of advanced technology and omnipresent
social media sites like Indieagogo, instagram and facebook, a photographer
no longer has to solely sustain projects like this just through avenues used by
photographers in previous decades.<span> And frankly I wouldn't be inclined to. This
is why I'm asking for your contributions, whether you have five dollars to offer or
fifty thousand.  Anyone have 50K? It is now up to my friends and supportive viewers to play their part in 
the
publication of our book.  I've always felt a degree of support and 
encouragement; but now I need a little help from my friends.</span></p>
<p>The minimum dollar amount for the production of this
book has been set at $17,000.<span>  This
amount of money will allow me to maintain the integrity of the imagery,
while creating an affordable and accessible book for my fans. 
In support of my fans, new and old, I have created an awesome perks
section, located on this page.  Look
there to view the numerous perks in store for those who participate in this
artistic endeavor.  There is something
for everyone in this section, whether you are a friend, co-conspirator, model,
photographer, or just someone looking to help fan the social commentary surrounding the effects
censorship. <br/></span></p>
<p>To those that have been along for the ride since the
beginning or if you’ve just recently come aboard, Thanks for your

Dabei merke ich mehr und mehr wie meine aktuelle Kamera nicht mehr ausreichend ist. Ein gutes Objektiv habe ich bereits, doch zwischen meiner Kamera mit APS-C Sensor und Vollformat liegen in Sachen Qualität trotzdem Welten.</p>
<p>Aus diesem Grund habe ich diese Kampagne auf die Beine gestellt. Ich möchte mir eine professionelle Kamera + Equipment zulegen um weiter wachsen zu können und noch bessere Fotos zu machen.</p>

Zum Vergleich könnt ihr gern die normalen Preise unter <a href=""http://www.laloriel.de/index.php/preise"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.laloriel.de/preise</a> einsehen. <br/><p>Des Weiteren bekommt Ihr im Gegenzug für verschiedene Spenden Prints Eurer Wahl in verschiedenen Größen oder Euer Bild in meinem Stil bearbeitet.<br/>Ich freue mich auch über einfache kleine (oder große ;) Spenden. Dazu müsst Ihr einfach rechts auf den Button ""Unterstützen"" gehen und könnt dort einen Betrag Eurer Wahl eingeben. Jede kleine Spende hilft mir, meinem Ziel ein Stückchen näher zu kommen.<br/></p>
<p>Mitmachen lohnt sich also auf jeden Fall! Für die Shootings könnt Ihr z.B. nach Dresden in mein Home-Studio kommen oder wir shooten Outdoor an einem Ort Eurer Wahl. Wer sich vor der Kamera unsicher ist und soetwas noch nie gemacht hat, kann sich ganz entspannt fühlen. Ich leite Dich locker an, mache Dir gegebenfalls Posen vor und es werden wunderschöne Bilder entstehen. Gerne komme ich auch zu Dir. Außerhalb Dresdens muss ich dafür dann aber eine Anfahrtspauschale berechnen.</p>
<p>Wenn Du ein Shooting über diese Kampagne buchst, vereinbaren wir schriftlich per E-Mail (info@laloriel.de) oder über meine Facebook-Seite einen Termin. Du musst übrigens nicht warten bis die Kampagne zuende ist. Sobald Du Dich für ein Paket entschieden hast, können wir einen Termin vereinbaren und das Shooting beginnen. Wenn Du selbst nie Make-Up anlegst, das aber für diese Gelegenheit einmal tun möchtest, so kannst Du gern noch das kleine Make-Up-Paket dazubuchen. Dafür schminke ich Dich dann dezent oder auch auffälliger je nach Wunsch für das Shooting.<br/></p>

Ich bin Laloriel und gehe seit 1,5 Jahren mit großer Leidenschaft der Portrait-Fotografie nach. Meine Bilder könnt ihr auf Facebook unter https://www.facebook.com/laloriel/ oder auf meiner Webseite unter www.laloriel.de verfolgen.Im vergangenen Jahr bin ich auf dem Gebiet der Fotografie stetig gewachsen und habe neue Erfahrungen gesammelt. Dabei merke ich mehr und mehr wie meine aktuelle Kamera nicht mehr ausreichend ist. Ein gutes Objektiv habe ich bereits, doch zwischen meiner Kamera mit APS-C Sensor und Vollformat liegen in Sachen Qualität trotzdem Welten.
Aus diesem Grund habe ich diese Kampagne auf die Beine gestellt. Ich möchte mir eine professionelle Kamera + Equipment zulegen um weiter wachsen zu können und noch bessere Fotos zu machen.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Zanmi Lakay has been teaching Photography Workshops in Haiti for over 15 years, from film to digital, providing tools and resources so our students can learn new skills, explore stories from their own point of view, and be part of the modern world.</p>
<p>Jouk Li Jou Kan Foto is an annual Photo Camp offering over 45 students a better future. We bring volunteer photojournalists and other professionals to Haiti to teach and share ideas in a 10-day intensive Workshop where student photographers from Cité Soleil and Jacmel, age 11-21, work together learning how to make photographs, shoot assignments, use computers, and then share their work in a month long exhibition with an opening night community celebration at the Fosaj Art Center in Jacmel.</p>
<p>These students are photo ambassadors learning how to share and inform people about Haiti from a Haitian point of view. In our group discussions, the students talk about important issues affecting their lives such as poverty, trash, sanitation, and the environment. With the simple addition of a camera, and the technical training, children become more a part of their own society to make it better. </p>
<p>Your support will have a positive and direct impact improving and uplifting their lives, as well as empowering them to promote progress within their own community.</p>
<p><strong>""What can photography do for my life?""</strong></p>
<p>Last year at the end of our second Youth Photo Camp, Djimmy, who is 18 and lives in Cité Soleil, and has also been one of our star students since 2009, asked us, ""What can photography do for my life?"" He is inspired and wants to be a photographer, and interested in how it can benefit his future.</p>
<p>How will we help him accomplish his dream? This year, we are answering Djimmy's question by incorporating business development curriculum into our Jouk Li Jou Kan Foto schedule to create employment opportunities by establishing a mobile portrait studio that will lead to future photography studios in Haiti, professional training about pathways into social media technology, and including more intensive photography and computer instruction.</p>
<p>Progress is already happening. Another star student, Fedno Lubin, age 20, is now the Photography director at ACFFC (Art Creation Foundation for Children). He has been shooting assignments that include special events, mural installations, and daily activities, and emailing them out weekly since September 2012 utilizing the skills and tools he's received through our Photo Workshops. His enthusiasm is contagious, and we are all very proud of him!</p>
<p><strong>What we need and what you get</strong></p>
<p>Funding is needed to pay for lodging, food, and transportation for photo students to come from Cité Soleil to work together with students in Jacmel. We are hiring two translators and a local driver, all of whom have worked with us during previous Photo Camps.</p>
<p>We need equipment and supplies for the daily progress of the Photo Camp and production of the exhibition including badges, batteries, hard drives, printers, ink, photo paper, and other materials. A fee is given to the gallery, and we sponsor artists and local performers that participate in the opening night community celebration. (See link to our WISH LIST below.)</p>
<p>When you contribute to our program, you are helping Djimmy, Fedno, and all of our students get the vital skills they need to use photography as a means to earn a living, receive critical training to give them an advantage in other endeavors, qualify these youth to have the confidence and the tools to give back to their own communities, and appreciate the beauty and dignity of their own expression. The support we receive from you, our investors, will have a direct impact on the futures of these talented budding photojournalists, and you can receive their photos of life in Haiti on cards, prints, and our limited edition calendars when you make a donation.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There is no other program like ours in Haiti. Zanmi Lakay has been supporting street children in Haiti for many years through School Sponsorship and Outreach Programs, along with the Photography Workshops, for youth with no other opportunities available. Our purpose is to improve the lives of these children in whatever ways we can. In our Photography Programs, the camera is our tool, and we're proud of the accomplishments our students have made while learning to use it.</p>
<p>Our Photojournalism students have been published on the New York Times Lens Blog and the Globe and Mail, and have had many exhibits in the U.S. and Haiti.</p>
<p>Every student takes home a camera, and the photographers from ACFFC have continued to make photographs under the leadership of Fedno documenting events, activities, and visitors. Other photographers visiting ACFFC throughout the year supplement the work we began with further fostering of skills and offering new experiences. Zanmi Lakay's Photography Workshops have led the way for the creation of a solid Photography Program at ACFFC.</p>

<p>Sucker Punched was primarily inspired by the Zack Snyder film, <i>Sucker Punch</i>. When we started doing a few test shoots,matching the tone and style, the project later grew and took on a sense of empowerment and agency. 
We had a lot of models interested in doing a shoot of this style and a 
lot of fans interested in seeing more. With great power came great 
responsibility, so we launched the last two year's campaigns to make a full 
series of these shoots and connected with <a href=""http://www.rainn.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RAINN</a>
 (The Rape Abuse and Incest National Network) to make sure we gave back with this project.</p>
<p>Our goal with Sucker Punched is to present original characters 
created in the style of powerful archetypes. We've got designs drawn 
from the best of fiction, local and regional models who will knock it 
out of the park,  fine photographic skills, and the costumes/hair/makeup/props to bring it all together. 
The models involved are presented as a celebration of powerful women, 
dangerous and strong. This is no ""bikini babe"" project here, quite the 
opposite really.</p>

 is looking to showcase women at their strongest. There is no need to

<p>When you play a video game or watch a movie, you as the viewer always accompany the hero from behind, facing nameless foes in an agreed battle of your right vs their wrong. It's bloody and you punch your way through and get the girl in the end. In Sucker Punched, you know your female hero, you stand beside her and see her strengths, but the faceless foe is by no means nameless. That foe is abuse, insecurity, discrimination. It's prejudice and doubt and it's a battle women fight daily in the war of life. Sucker Punched is the pictorial upper cut to those shared enemies. Seeing a woman be glorified for her strengths, celebrated for her femininity, and embraced for her willingness to fight is something we as a culture are starved for. Instead of teaching girls to shut up, to make themselves smaller, to only chase boys, we are showcasing a breed of women who can help themselves - no rescue mission needed here. Perhaps seeing a woman who looks like your sister, your girlfriend, or your best friend presented as the bad ass superhero she is on the inside, we can foster an atmosphere of independence and individuality that is grossly lacking in our media.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p>

For those of you who are back, welcome! Thanks for joining us for another go 'round! 
To those of you who are new to us, come on in! We are FightGuy Photography - a photography studio based in Northern Virginia, specializing in portraits and events. Sucker Punched is one of our babies. What is Sucker Punched?I'm glad you asked! Sucker Punched is a photography series, wherein we take some of the many amazing, talented, inspiring women we know and we give them the SP treatment, a transformation into an original action hero. These women, in cooperation with our creative team, become bad ass, dangerous, gorgeous, iconic figures to match anything you'd find in a comic book or action movie.

On our first visit in 2015, the mine and the town of PYRAMIDEN were still largely untouched. Only five part-time residents spent their time here in the months of May to September. They were joined by only a handful of adventurers and day-trippers, in rare cases someone stayed overnight.</p><p><i>Während mein erstes Buch CONCORDIA einen untergegangenen Vergnügungsort beschreibt, widme ich das zweite Buch PYRAMIDEN einem untergegangenen Ort, der auf dem Weg ist, zu einem Vergnügungsort zu werden.

Zu ihnen gesellten sich eine Handvoll  Abenteurer und Tagestouristen, in seltenen Fällen blieb mal jemand über Nacht.</i></p><p>Today, the situation on ground is completely different: The refurbished city-hotel is used by numerous visitors and huge ships packed with tourists arrive every day.

The pictures in the book probably show the original PYRAMIDEN for the last time.</p><p><i>Heute ist die Situation vor Ort eine völlig Andere: Das sanierte Hotel der Stadt wird von zahlreichen Besuchern genutzt und täglich kommen große Schiffe mit Touristen.

<p>My name is Reese. I am a 30 something young professional and mother of 5, born and raised in Columbus, OH and I am a visual artist and photographer.</p>
<p>For several years, I have been on a quest to discover myself and realize my purpose. After working for many years (since age 14) as a customer service rep for several major companies from retail, to banks to satellite providers, I promised myself that I would break free from the world of 9-5 and pursue my passion as an artist and young entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Being a mother, especially of the African American ""working class"" demographic-the road to success trying to pursue my dreams as a successful full-time artists has been a challenging one. Along the way I have experienced many life lessons as well as beautiful highs and tragic lows. Through it all, I have promised myself and my family that I will never stop and I will never quit.  In the summer of 2012 while dealing with a heavy bout of depression during the start of a trying custody battle, I embarked on a journey to find myself and conquer the monster of depression and a hefty anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>I began to ask the Universe to reveal to me the truth of my existence and to guide me into my calling to help me understand my gifts, fine tune my passion and to usher me into becoming the woman, artist, teacher and mother that I know I was born to be.</p>
<p>In March of 2013-I had a revelation one morning as I sat in my bed during meditation. I had just purchased my first ""pricey"" camera-a Canon EOS t3i. At the time, it was an expensive purchase. The most I'd ever spent outside of buying a car. I didn't know what I was going to do, all I knew was that I had a passion and undying love for photography since I was a little girl. I began learning black and white photography with a manual Vivitar camera back in 2002 and have been in love ever since. </p>
<p>That beautiful morning I sat giving thanks for all that I had in that moment and it was then that this far fetch and ""crazy"" idea came to me...I heard a voice in my head and it said: ""You have to go to New York."" I said to myself--""What?!"" I had always dreamed of going to New York. I'm not an experienced traveler, had no idea where to start and could not imagine just going on a whim. I had day dreamed and watch films and read articles about the architecture, the people, the business the art scene and have even been asked many times if I was from there because of my big energy and flair. But I NEVER thought I'd just-Up and Go....</p>
<p>The next thing I knew, I was booking a Grey Hound ticket and a 4 day hotel stay in SoHo at a hostel on Bowery Street. Somehow, I managed to stretch $350 with $75 to spend and took the trip of a life time. During my stay I walked the city, took the subway and taxi cab like a native, met some of the most AMAZING people and had some of the most life changing experiences and I did alone on a ""whim"". Or was it?</p>
<p>As I braved the ""city that never sleeps""-just me and my camera, I found a new level of self awareness and confidence that I had NEVER known. All of a sudden, the noise and chaos that once riddled my mind had come to a stand still and I felt alive for the very first first time. There I stood, leaning against a skyscraper at the corner of 6th Ave and Avenue of Americas holding a grande chai latte with my camera around my neck, watching what seemed like the WORLD zip and buzz past me going a million miles a minute. In that moment-I found the most overwhelming sense of peace and calm. I had ""tapped in"".  When I returned home I soon came to the understanding that my experience in NYC was a personal pilgrimage to pay homage to the vibrant energy and essence of artists and photographers that have paved the way for me and many other young, dazed and confused artists alike. I realized that I had just experienced a glimpse of what it was like to be moving in my calling and in my craft with no inhibition.</p>
<p>My trip to NYC not only assisted me in silencing the chaos, it opened me up to a new and refreshing way of thinking. I had epiphany after epiphany on life, what it means to be a creative, an artist, a teacher a leader in the community and most of all--a leader. I even developed a concept for another upcoming community art project and a book for others that struggle with finding themselves in the world.</p>
<p>I humbly introduce to you a project that has been 31 years in the making. A project that gives you a close up and first hand look at my experience, the streets, avenues, sights and life changing moments frozen in time of a culturally, artistically and historically rich city.      </p>
<p><b>MECCA METROPOLIS</b></p>
<p>This campaign is designed to raise funds for supplies, equipment, printing, framing, reception space and a follow up trip to catch additional images that I did not get a chance to capture during my brief stay. The funds raised during this campaign will assist me in revealing my story and personal journey as a photographer and will be my introduction to the world during my FIRST gallery exhibition here in my home town by telling my story and experiences as I explore NYC aka The Art Mecca.</p>
<p>I plan to use this showing as the start of a series of works which will include multiple cities across the US and eventually world wide. With your love and contributions, I intend to capture images from major cities across the country and bring them home to share them with other struggling young artists and photo enthusiasts-especially our youth, to be an inspiration and show them that if ""If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere."" I want to teach them that there is no limit to what we can do and that we ALL can realize our wildest dreams and do amazing things if we just ""Listen"" to that voice inside that guides you to EXACTLY where you are destined to be.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Details</h3> <p>I am seeking your help for the following:</p> <ul> <li>funding for another brief stay which includes travel and hostel accommodations to shoot more images to add to the collection. (I just couldn't get it all the last time)</li>
<li>printing and framing of the pieces for viewing during a cocktail and hors d'oeuvres reception at a well known up and coming gallery here in Columbus</li>
<li>a limited series of coffee table photo books and small prints to raise funds for the next pilgrimage and series of images. (Next stop--Chicago)</li>
</ul>
<div>What you get:</div>
<ul> <li>A special invitation (for all of you local contributors) to a public Showing event at the gallery with live music, poetry and tasty snacks while you get a first look at the collection which will also be for sale. (All proceed will go towards upcoming projects and ART.Mobile)</li> <li>A signed and numbered 5x7 print of one of my favorite images</li>
<li>My deepest and most heartfelt appreciation for making my dreams a reality</li>
<li>Please see PERKS for more ""Special"" goodies for contributions of $50 or more</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I am just a vessel. You are just a vessel. WE are all--Vessels. </p>
<p>This is an epiphany that I had during my trip. I realized that we all are creators and creatives buzzing around trying to find our way. For those of us that express ourselves and define our existence and reality through the arts--it can be a hard road. I know first hand the look on people's faces when you tell them that you are an artist (especially here in Ohio). It's not an easy task to gain the trust and respect of others let alone position yourself if you don't come from a well known college or art collective. I am a natural born artist with passion, drive and a desire to reach, teach and motivate others-from toddlers to senior citizens to be the best vessel you can be (no matter your calling ) by listening to that voice within that leads and guides you to serve your higher purpose during this life time.</p>
<p>This will be the PREMIERE of my work to the world and the start of a new chapter of an epic life story that I hope to some day share with my grand children, your children, the kinky haired girl down the way and the young teenager who sees the world in a very unique way.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> I.. Am not a quitter.  Whether this campaign is successful or not-I want you to know that it was revealed to me that if I stick to my path and walk with no fear-that the story will be told, lives will be changed and work will be done. </p>
<p>I have overcome losing my family, battled depression and anxiety, managed to work my way out of homelessness, joblessness, attempted suicide and believing the world was against me. </p>
<p>Like all things, there will come challenges. But with a level head, a clear mind and an entire COMMUNITY of supporters and FAMILY behind me, I have come to discover that ALL things are possible if you KNOW with molecule of your being that-that voice within is the voice of The Creator whispering to you. Guiding you to do what you born to do. </p>
<p>Over time I have had the blessing to befriend some amazing people also aspiring to live their dreams as artists, event planners, accountants and managers and I have learned from studying world know entrepreneurs that if there is something that you don't know how to do-find someone with the know how that you can trust to make it happen.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>So you can't make a contribution today. If what I have shared with you touches you or inspires you.... Just SHARE...Share with everyone that you know. Even the smallest effort will make a difference....</p>

In my very exciting career as a professional Web Developer and Designer I had the possibility to participate in various creative projects where I gained a lot of experience in Web Development and Design.<br/><br/>I've always wanted to use my professional abilities and experience as Web Developer and Designer to start my own creative project which should be useful and dedicated to the general public.
As a very passionate photographer I decided to create a new photo community according to my own vision of an exceptional photo community with new innovative features where everyone can simply create a professional and beautiful photography portfolio which will be inspiring and meaningful to photographers around the world.<br/><br/>After the detailed preparations with a few workmates and the very promising design templates we started the development of an awesome new photo community for creative and professional photographers which became Snappped.
Snappped is now almost finished after a very exciting development time of 2,5 years and we would like to launch the Snappped Beta in Spring 2014.<br/><br/><br/><h3>WHERE WE ARE</h3>We have already completed the development of Snappped because of the outstanding groundwork in the last 2,5 years and right now we are constantly testing Snappped.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/387719/files/20140222165739-Main_Snappped_Indiegogo_Background_02.png?1393117059"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/387721/files/20140222165757-Main_Snappped_Indiegogo_Background_01.png?1393117077"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/387722/files/20140222165809-Main_Snappped_Indiegogo_Background_03.png?1393117089"" src="""" style=""""/>If you would like to see more about Snappped and what we have already created then please visit us on Dribbble: <a href=""http://dribbble.com/thorstenhaak"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://dribbble.com/thorstenhaak</a> or like us on Facebook: <a href=""http://facebook.com/snappped"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://facebook.com/snappped</a> and follow us on Twitter: <a href=""http://twitter.com/snappped"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://twitter.com/snappped</a> for the latest updates about Snappped.</p><p><br/></p><h3>WHY INDIEGOGO</h3>Snappped is now almost finished because of the outstanding groundwork in the last 2,5 years and we would like to launch the Snappped Beta in Spring 2014.
But it will be very difficult for us to launch the Snappped Beta without your support because our financial reserves are exhausted and that's the reason why we need help now to cover the further development costs, web hosting services and other additional expenses which is required and allows us to finally complete Snappped.<br/><br/>1. We secured several domains (snappped.com, snappped.de, snappped.co.uk, snappped.org, snappped.net, snappped.us, snappped.me) for safety reasons and need help to cover the web hosting service expenses.<br/><br/>2. We would like to extend Snappped with a powerful API (Application Programming Interface) which for example will allow members to share their beautiful photography portfolios from Snappped with live updates on their own websites.<br/><br/>3. We are convinced that guidelines and personal rights are very important and should be carefully crafted and created. That's why we would like to hire an experienced lawyer who will help us to create the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for Snappped.<br/><br/>4. Web security is very important to us and that's why we would like to hire a web security specialist who will help us to improve the security of Snappped.<br/><br/>5. We would like to purchase an authorized SSL (Secure Socket Layer) - Certificate for the important Domain's like <a href=""http://snappped.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://snappped.com</a> to ensure a secure data communication in the internet which is required to improve the security of Snappped.<br/><br/>6.

In my very exciting career as a professional Web Developer and Designer I had the possibility to participate in various creative projects where I gained a lot of experience in Web Development and Design.I've always wanted to use my professional abilities and experience as Web Developer and Designer to start my own creative project which should be useful and dedicated to the general public.
As a very passionate photographer I decided to create a new photo community according to my own vision of an exceptional photo community with new innovative features where everyone can simply create a professional and beautiful photography portfolio which will be inspiring and meaningful to photographers around the world.After the detailed preparations with a few workmates and the very promising design templates we started the development of an awesome new photo community for creative and professional photographers which became Snappped.
Snappped is now almost finished after a very exciting development time of 2,5 years and we would like to launch the Snappped Beta in Spring 2014.WHERE WE AREWe have already completed the development of Snappped because of the outstanding groundwork in the last 2,5 years and right now we are constantly testing Snappped.If you would like to see more about Snappped and what we have already created then please visit us on Dribbble: http://dribbble.com/thorstenhaak or like us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/snappped and follow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/snappped for the latest updates about Snappped.WHY INDIEGOGOSnappped is now almost finished because of the outstanding groundwork in the last 2,5 years and we would like to launch the Snappped Beta in Spring 2014.
But it will be very difficult for us to launch the Snappped Beta without your support because our financial reserves are exhausted and that's the reason why we need help now to cover the further development costs, web hosting services and other additional expenses which is required and allows us to finally complete Snappped.1. We secured several domains (snappped.com, snappped.de, snappped.co.uk, snappped.org, snappped.net, snappped.us, snappped.me) for safety reasons and need help to cover the web hosting service expenses.2. We would like to extend Snappped with a powerful API (Application Programming Interface) which for example will allow members to share their beautiful photography portfolios from Snappped with live updates on their own websites.3. We are convinced that guidelines and personal rights are very important and should be carefully crafted and created. That's why we would like to hire an experienced lawyer who will help us to create the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for Snappped.4. Web security is very important to us and that's why we would like to hire a web security specialist who will help us to improve the security of Snappped.5. We would like to purchase an authorized SSL (Secure Socket Layer) - Certificate for the important Domain's like http://snappped.com to ensure a secure data communication in the internet which is required to improve the security of Snappped.6.  We would like to extend Snappped with a powerful photo album function whereby members are able to create their own photo albums with beautiful photos created by creative and professional photographers from around the world.THANK YOUWe really appreciate every support and help we receive and if you can't support us with a financial contribution you can still become an important part of Snappped and help us to create an awesome new photo community for creative and professional photographers.Please help us spread the word and share our Snappped Indiegogo campaign with your friends and family, and like us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/snappped follow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/snappped and Dribbble: http://dribbble.com/thorstenhaak and Behance: http://behance.net/thorstenhaak for the latest updates, and subscribe on Snappped: http://snappped.com to the Snappped Beta.

Hello!
My name is Laura Nichols Stanley of Laura B Photography. I've been
taking photos for friends and families for 3 years now,
but my passion for photography did not start there. My love for
photography started many years ago through my love of my father's
photos. As a child and teenager I was an artist, drawing sketches of
everything I could see and imagine;
leading me to study Art
at Morehead University. As I have grown in age and experience, so too
have my abilities to see beauty and art in everything around me. I
turned to photography as a way to preserve that beauty,
to
look back on it whenever I wanted. I love being able to offer
this to my clients;
to
capture moments of love and happiness for them to treasure. In this
way, a little part of me is carried with each person and each family.
I love knowing that when they look back at those images, it was I
that saved those moments for them. I offer my services for families,
high school seniors, expecting mothers, newborns, pets, and much
more!  </p>
<p>
By
contributing to Laura B Photography you will be helping me push
forward toward my dream of being able to focus all of my time,
attention, and talent on this business. You will be donating funds
toward the purchase of higher quality equipment, which
will allow me
to surpass
the limitations of my current equipment and be able to offer the best
quality photographs possible
to my clients. Therefore, allowing me to build a larger client base,
making
it possible to establish
photography as
my career. Everyone dreams of turning
their passion into
their career, you can help me do this. Thank you! </p>

<p>We didn't want to create a traditional photo project where a photographer goes to a remote location, take some snaps of some exotic people to come back and show it to his friends as a piece of decoration on the coffee table. We wanted our project to be about the people and for the people and their places and trying to find a way to make our pictures benefit their lives.</p>
<p>So we started thinking and researching online on similar projects where people used art as tool for social change. and we discovered there are quite a few of them around, so we decided to take a different track on our concept.</p>
<p>That’s when it hit us: It was pretty simple, so here is what we are going to do: We will go to places where people have no or very little access to a camera. And we will take professional portraits of the people in those places. Then we will use a portable Polaroid printer to print these peoples pictures and give it back to them. So they can treasure their memories for ever.</p>
<p><img alt=""the printer we will be using along the trip"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.photographyblog.com/images/uploads_news_gallery_ee1/polaroid_gl10.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I mean, think about the significance of a family portrait. Think about the amount of memories and feelings your family photos bring you. I know this because this is what I do for a living. That moment in time that is never coming back is priceless.</p>
<p>Now imagine if you didn’t have any moments like this to remember. If you grew up with no cameras or if your family could never afford to get their pictures taken.</p>
<p>If your house was on fire and you could only take one thing out of the house what would it be? If you answered ""family photo album"" you already understand what this project is about.</p>
<p>So our proposal is to take as many pictures of people as we can, our focus is not on the ""misery and poverty award winning sad photos"". We want to take photos that give people a sense of identity, pictures that bring them joy, pictures that they can keep for generation to come.

<h2><strong>PROJECT INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Abby and I am photographer. Over the past 6 months, I have been working on a project called ‘<em>in.visible</em>’ together with the <a href=""http://hopecentermn.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HOPE CENTER in Faribault</a>, Minnesota. ‘<em>In.visible</em>’ is a project about stories. We all have stories to tell - I believe that is one of the reasons that make us unique as human beings. The stories we have to tell make us who we are. </p>
<p>‘<em>In.visible</em>’ is about the stories of 5 brave women who at one point in their lives experienced sexual assault and/abuse. 6 months ago, I conceptualized ‘<em>In.visible</em>’ as an image-making project intended to advocate for greater awareness of sexual assault and abuse as well as provide an outlet of healing and validation for the women. I believe strongly that for healing to begin and continue for women , who have these experiences, we must allow these stories to be spoken openly. As a community, we must be willing to listen attentively. <em>In.visible</em> is committed to provide and outlet for these deeply wounded women to tell their stories.</p>
<p>I have been working with these women: listening to their stories, interacting with them and photographing their lives. These images along with short films will be displayed at a multi-media art installation and exhibit held from the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>29th April to 10th</strong> </span>May at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota. </p>
<h2> </h2>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>I am three quarters through my project and almost done photographing most of the women. In my project, I used both film and digital photography that involved experimental methods as well as digital video.</p>
<p>However, for the exhibit to happen, I need funds to help with printing and additional materials that will go to making the exhibit possible. In the not so distant future, I also hope to publish these images in a book.</p>
<p>**Check out the reward section for what you will receive if you donate generously to this project! -----&gt;</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>I am raising <strong>$5000</strong> for this project:</h2>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">** NOTE: if more than $5000 is given, it will help to cover the administrative costs that will go into using indiegogo to fundraise!</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$800 - 35mm black an white film, darkroom materials, paper to make black and white film prints, additional materials to make experimental prints on materials like glass and wood.</li>
<li>$200 - polaroid films and necessary equipment for exploring experimental methods using polaroid film</li>
<li>$2000 - digital printing, inks, professional printing paper.</li>
<li>$2000 - final touches on the images in preparation for exhibit, framing, matting, video-equipment to display the videos</li>
</ul>
<p>If it pleases you, please give generously to this project. It will go a long way to helping validate the stories of these women and also help other women to speak up about their experiences. </p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
Contributing to this project will greatly validate the stories and the healing process of these women. It will encourage women in similar circumstances who view this exhibit to speak up about their experiences.

<p><i>' I had a great uncle Frank “Yaki” Yakimovich whom I met only once at a family reunion in 1982. He was what you call a rock hound. I remember he led me to his faded Arizona car, opened the trunk, and pulled out a roundish rock, a hammer, and a chisel. With a single strike, he cracked open the rock. The center was luminous with crystals. “It’s a geode!” Uncle Yaki put it in my hand. I stared at it, and at him, and then back at the rock. My eight-year-old mind was blown. I have never looked at a rock the same way. The work of Charalampos “Harry” Kydonakis makes me think of geodes and the wonder I felt when I first encountered them. Harry doesn’t use photography to stop time and describe space. He uses his camera and flash like a hammer and chisel to crack open time and space. He shows you what was there, and then he shows you a bit more than what was there. The work has some of the moody beauty I see in Gueorgui Pinkhassov, the deep regional and narrative integrity I feel from Cristóbal Hara, and the raunchy dark comedy of late Philip Guston. When Harry, who is known as “dirty harrry” online, speaks about his photographs he talks about “his island” and “his village.” He talks about girls, animals, and shadows. The pictures have details that repel and attract; they have a smell, they have a breeze. The more you look at the work, the more you think that there is indeed an island, a village, that looks like this all the time. A place where faces go black or are lit from below, where animals and kites appear unexpectedly, where people from the present, past, and future mingle. His pictures flirt with the ironic, at times they border on the insane, and yet the car stays on the road... I believe in this place, Kydonakis’ island, pictures that make me feel like I’m moving back and forth between the concrete and the imagined, revealing depths that surprise and inspire. I believe that Kydonakis knows how to find and open geodes. '</i></p>

​​Midtown Manhattan, 2014What ?I asked two of my favorite childhood books to help me put my thoughts together on paper; 'Warn'd in Vain' - the book of this campaign - is a NYC story inspired by the Argonautic myth. It is a twin book of 'Back to Nowhere', a parallel Minotaur tale from Crete, hopefully to be published at some moment in the future. Williamsburg, 2015'Warn'd in Vain' book :
photographs & design by dirtyharrry

' I had a great uncle Frank “Yaki” Yakimovich whom I met only once at a family reunion in 1982. He was what you call a rock hound. I remember he led me to his faded Arizona car, opened the trunk, and pulled out a roundish rock, a hammer, and a chisel. With a single strike, he cracked open the rock. The center was luminous with crystals. “It’s a geode!” Uncle Yaki put it in my hand. I stared at it, and at him, and then back at the rock. My eight-year-old mind was blown. I have never looked at a rock the same way. The work of Charalampos “Harry” Kydonakis makes me think of geodes and the wonder I felt when I first encountered them. Harry doesn’t use photography to stop time and describe space. He uses his camera and flash like a hammer and chisel to crack open time and space. He shows you what was there, and then he shows you a bit more than what was there. The work has some of the moody beauty I see in Gueorgui Pinkhassov, the deep regional and narrative integrity I feel from Cristóbal Hara, and the raunchy dark comedy of late Philip Guston. When Harry, who is known as “dirty harrry” online, speaks about his photographs he talks about “his island” and “his village.” He talks about girls, animals, and shadows. The pictures have details that repel and attract; they have a smell, they have a breeze. The more you look at the work, the more you think that there is indeed an island, a village, that looks like this all the time. A place where faces go black or are lit from below, where animals and kites appear unexpectedly, where people from the present, past, and future mingle. His pictures flirt with the ironic, at times they border on the insane, and yet the car stays on the road... I believe in this place, Kydonakis’ island, pictures that make me feel like I’m moving back and forth between the concrete and the imagined, revealing depths that surprise and inspire. I believe that Kydonakis knows how to find and open geodes. '

<h3>Change is good...</h3>

<p>Earlier this year I got together with my best friend (a photographer in  my area) with the intent on pushing our careers to the next level. Me as a model and designer, and he as a photographer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after I decided to pick up a camera of my own to add another layer of variety to the content, misunderstandings and petty arguements arose. Breaking our 2 year long working relationship and subsequently our friendship as well.</p>
<p>As sad, frustrated and angry as I was I didn't want to let anyone down. After dealing with threats of legal action, fights over rights and wishy-washy investors, I was left carrying the full load of the financial and creative load.</p>
<p>I bear it happily!</p>
<p>Since then I have been able to collect several interviews, taken tons of photos and have 2 issues laid out. My goal is to have 4 done before releasing #1 so I am ahead of the game (since the content isn't dated material).</p>
<p>I am currently heah-hunting for consistant contributors for writing and photography as well as interesting people to interview.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about th behavior of people and the law. Now I have a better understanding of what an undertaking like this is and I am better prepared than ever to tackle it.</p>

<p><b>Beauty In Hell is an award winning, independent reportage and a
personal photographic dream created to find and document the beauty present
in some of the most difficult, poverty stricken and dangerous realities around
the world. </b></p>
<p>My name is Tony Corocher and I am a documentary and fine art photographer.</p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1055460/files/20141129072828-IMAGES_01a.jpg?1417274908"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p><b></b>
<p><b>BEAUTY IN HELL is a critical and personal artistic response to an
increased awareness of living in a system that uses drama everywhere</b>. I
believe we are now unconsciously accustomed to consider an event interesting
and noteworthy only if it contains some form of strong contrast, therefore if
it is dramatic. <br/></p><p>Without drama there is no news and everything becomes boring, dull
and almost unworthy of our attention… we use drama to create
sensationalism. <b>But Drama is just one
part of the story… if drama becomes the only
thing mainstream media covers
and the only thing we hold up, what can we expect to grow from it?</b> </p>
<p><b>
</b></p><p><b>With Beauty In Hell I
want to to express, </b>through artistic sensibility,<b> exactly the opposite
and show that beauty within the human spirit is always present, in every
situation, even in the most difficult and dangerous realities around the world.

<p><b></b>
<b>BEAUTY IN HELL was born as a dream, </b>and I’ve spent the last 3 years developing it, injecting all of my passion and experience in to
it, and dealing with the associated risks and dangers.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>In 2011 I started the project by researching and
documenting everyday situations in Vietnam, Kenya and Nepal .<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>In 2012-13 I documented beauty inside the frightening
realities of the Mathare and Kibera slums (Nairobi, Kenya), of the refugee camps in
North Kenya and other hard situations in the Middle East and Asia <b>(more info and a backstage video about Mathare and Kibera Slums at the end of this page).</b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Last year BEAUTY IN HELL received several
international awards and was exhibited in venues around the world <b>(more info and a video about the awards and the exhibitions <b>at the end of this page</b>).</b><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This recognition has helped me realize that, maybe, <b>we are finally
ready to see things from a different perspective … THAT OF BEAUTY! And not just
through the lens of drama, which breeds fear, which in turn breeds drama... a vicious circle that needs to be exposed and stopped!</b></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1070357/files/20141204030359-IMAGES_04a.jpg?1417691039"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>Starting next January, and during
the course of 2015, I will be documenting the beauty in difficult and dangerous
realities across Asia. At the moment the selected stages are in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Myamar, Bangladesh, Nepal/Tibet, China/Mongolia. 

<br/><br/><p><b>Unfortunately, it is not possible for me
to explain exactly where, when and what the exact situations are.</b> <b><b>As I am sure you will understand, for
reasons concerning security, safety and to avoid further risks for both 
me and my guides, these situations cannot be revealed until they have 
been fully documented and the work is finished.</b><br/></b></p><p><b>It is essential that each and every
situation develops in a spontaneous, true and natural way</b>… and one of the
best ways to do this is to come across them unexpectedly, in order to find the
story while you are there, directly from the local people and everyday situations. <b><br/>
</b></p><p></p><p></p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Beauty In Hell is an ongoing project, and this is our first IndieGoGo
campaign developed to raise the funds needed to
produce the new artwork for the BEAUTY IN HELL Photographic Exhibition that
will be held in galleries and venues around the world in 2015-16. </b><br/></p><p>At
present we have received availability from venues in Venice, Milan, Switzerland
&amp; USA (we will keep you informed of new venues with regular updates).</p>

informing and raising awareness of these desperate situations, but at the same time we
want to do so in a different way<b>... <b>we are committed to showing that beauty, humanity and real people matter… not just
drama! This is what we believe defines all of
us.</b></b><br/></p><p>
</p>
<p></p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>First of all, we ask you to <b>believe in us and in the Project,</b> as we
do. To accomplish the next step, to be able to travel
to the locations, document and show you new realities, <b>we now need external support too… YOUR SUPPORT!</b> </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you love photography, if you
care about independent photojournalism or if you simply appreciate what <b>BEAUTY IN HELL</b> stands
for, we hope you will <b>join us in
our attempt to show the power of Beauty over drama and sensationalism!</b> <b><span><br/>Help us recognize
that Beauty! that Humanity! and the truth that real people matter!</span></b></p>
<b></b>
<p><b><u>EVERY SINGLE DONATION REALLY COUNTS… EVEN SMALL
ONES ARE VITAL!</u></b></p>
<ul>
</ul>We ask
for the support of the press, from photographers, from editors, from
educators and schools, from professionals in every field… <b>You are the recommendations we need and count upon!</b><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1156006/files/20150117164012-separator.jpg?1421541612"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Each
Contributor will support the project in two parallel ways: 

</p><ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b><b>On an artistic and personal level</b></b>: by helping us develop the new Artwork for the
traveling Exhibition.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>
<b>On a social, educational and cultural level</b>: </b>by exposing frequently
overlooked  realities and bringing
awareness to difficult situations around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time <b>every Contributor will receive one or more of our artistic
reward</b> and become a collector too (see perks and rewards in the next chapters). <br/>

</b><p><b>Beauty In Hell è un reportage indipendente, vincitore di diversi premi
internazionali e, allo stesso tempo, un sogno fotografico personale sviluppato
negli anni con l’obiettivo di trovare e documentare la bellezza presente in
alcune delle realtà più difficili, povere e pericolose al mondo.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Mi chiamo Tony Corocher e sono un fotografo documentarista e fine art.</p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1144067/files/20150111163504-IMAGES_ita_01.jpg?1421022904"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p><b>BEAUTY IN HELL nasce come critica
personale e risposta artistica alla consapevolezza di vivere all’interno di un
sistema che fa uso del dramma in tutto.</b> Noi ormai ci
siamo inconsciamente abituati a considerare una cosa interessante e degna di
nota solo se contiene dei forti contrasti, quindi se è drammatica. 

<p>Senza dramma non c’è notizia e tutto diventa noioso… utilizziamo il dramma
per fare sensazionalismo. <b>Ma il dramma è solo una parte della storia…. se il
dramma diventa la sola cosa che i media ci trasmettono e quindi la sola cosa a
cui facciamo riferimento, che cosa possiamo aspettarci di diverso dal prossimo
futuro?</b></p>
<p><b>Con “BEAUTY IN HELL” voglio esprimere,
</b>attraverso la sensibilità artistica, <b>esattamente l’opposto e mostrare che la bellezza dentro lo spirito umano
è sempre presente, in ogni situazione, anche quando le condizioni sono
veramente drammatiche e i luoghi molto duri e difficili.</b></p>

<p><b></b>
<b></b></p>
<p><b>BEAUTY IN HELL è nato come sogno personale 3 anni fa… è stato sviluppato,
finanziato e portato in mostra con le mie forze iniettandoci tutta la mia
passione e la mia esperienza, e affrontando i rischi e pericoli correlati (e
anche con l’aiuto in vari campi di alcune persone a me vicine in diversi
paesi).</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Nel 2011 ho iniziato il progetto svolgendo ricerche
     e raccogliendo documentazione in Vietnam, Kenya e Nepal.</li>
<li>In 2012-13 ho documentato la bellezza dentro le spaventose realtà delle
     baraccopoli di Mathare e Kibera (Nairobi, Kenya), i campi profughi nel
     Nord del Kenya ed altri luoghi molto duri in Medio Oriente ed Asia <b>(più informazioni a
     riguardo ed un video del backstage nelle prossime pagine).</b>
</li>
<li>L’anno scorso <b>BEAUTY
     IN HELL</b> ha ricevuto diversi premi internazionali ed è stato esposto in
     diverse sedi in giro per il mondo. <b>(più informazioni ed un video a
     riguardo nelle prossime pagine).</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Questi riconoscimenti
mi hanno aiutato a capire che, forse,<b> siamo finalmente pronti a vedere
quello che succede sotto una<span>  luce
diversa… QUELLA DELLA BELLEZZA! non solo attraverso il dramma che produce paura
che produce dramma... un circolo vizioso che deve essere esposto e fermato!</span></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1144071/files/20150111163644-IMAGES_ita_04.jpg?1421023004"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>A cominciare dal prossimo
gennaio, e nel corso del 2015, cercherò di documentare la bellezza in realtà
difficili e pericolose all’interno dell’Asia. Al momento le tappe previste sono
Vietnam (dove arriverò il 5 gennaio), Cambodia, Myamar, Bangladesh,
Nepal/Tibet, China/Mongolia… ma sono probabili variazioni durante il percorso.</p>
<p><b>Sfortunatamente non mi è possibile spiegare con precisione dove, quando e
quali saranno nello specifico i luoghi e le situazioni che incontrerò. Per ragioni
legate alla sicurezza, protezione e per evitare ulteriori rischi sia a me che
alle guide che mi accompagneranno, queste situazioni non possono essere svelate
almeno fino a quando non sono state documentate ed il lavoro completato. </b></p>
<p><b>E’ essenziale che ogni situazione si sviluppi in modo spontaneo, vero e
naturale, </b>e uno dei modi migliori per
farlo è di trovarsi lì inaspettati, quasi per caso, così da trovare la le
immagini e le storie direttamente dalla gente locale.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>E’ importante ricordare che BEAUTY IN HELL è un progetto in fase di sviluppo,
creato nel corso degli anni. Il goal di questa fase è di raccogliere i fondi
che mi permettano di produrre il nuovo Artwork per la mostra fotografica che si
terrà nel corso del 2015-16 in gallerie e sedi varie in giro per il mondo. </b>Al momento ho ricevuto disponibilità a Venezia, Milano,
Svizzera e Stati Uniti (vi terremo informati sulle nuove sedi con aggiornamenti
regolari).</p>

</p><p><b></b>
</p><p><b></b>L’obiettivo finale rimane sì quello di informare e portare consapevolezza
di queste situazioni, ma allo stesso tempo cercare di farlo in un modo diverso…
<b>ci stiamo impegnando a mostrare che la
bellezza, l’umanità e le persone reali sono la cosa più importante… non solo il
dramma! Questo, credo, è ciò che definisce tutti noi.</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>Prima di tutto vi chiediamo di <b></b>
<b>DI CREDERE IN NOI E NEL PROGETTO</b>.<br/> Per portare il Progetto al livello successivo, per raggiungere questi posti,
documentare e mostrare nuove realtà, <b>ORA ABBIAMO NECESSARIAMENTE BISOGNO DI SUPPORTO ESTERNO… DEL VOSTRO SUPPORTO! </b></p>
<p>Se amate la fotografia, se vi interessa il fotogiornalismo indipendente o
se semplicemente apprezzate quello che <b>BEAUTY
IN HELL</b> rappresenta, <b>vi chiedo di
unirvi a noi nel tentativo di mostrare la forza della Bellezza sul dramma e sul
sensazionalismo!</b><br/>
<br/>
<b><u>OGNI SINGOLO CONTRIBUTO CONTA VERAMENTE TANTO… E, ANCHE SE PICCOLO, E’ DI FONDAMENTALE IMPORTANZA!</u></b></p>
<ul>
</ul>Ci serve il supporto della stampa, da parte dei
fotografi, degli editori, degli insegnanti e delle scuole, da parte di tutti i
professionisti in ogni campo… <b>Voi siete le

<li>

<li>
<b>quello sociale, educativo e culturale: </b>permettendoci di esporre

</ul>

ricompensa artistica derivata dall’Artwork finale e diventerà anche un

le risorse, la passione e le conoscenze, e faremo tutto il resto del lavoro con
i nostri mezzi.</p>

riuscire a pagare voli, trasporti, vitto ed alloggio, documenti, visti, guide ed
assicurazioni, visite mediche per 2 persone, più coprire i costi di produzione
sul posto, di registrazione ai premi internazionali e per preparare/organizzare
le Mostre.<br/></p><p><b>La cifra realistica per coprire un progetto come questo</b> e assicurare un
prodotto finale professionale e di alta qualità, è di circa 50.000 US$, e
ovviamente coltiviamo la speranza di raggiungere quella cifra. <b>Comunque una grossa parte di questa somma è
già stata coperta da noi e dal nostro lavoro (20.000 US$ per: ricerche
iniziali, editing &amp; post production, social networks, sito web, hosting, attrezzatura

personal photographic dream created to find and document the beauty present
in some of the most difficult, poverty stricken and dangerous realities around
the world. 
My name is Tony Corocher and I am a documentary and fine art photographer.

BEAUTY IN HELL is a critical and personal artistic response to an
increased awareness of living in a system that uses drama everywhere. I
believe we are now unconsciously accustomed to consider an event interesting
and noteworthy only if it contains some form of strong contrast, therefore if
it is dramatic. Without drama there is no news and everything becomes boring, dull
and almost unworthy of our attention… we use drama to create
sensationalism. But Drama is just one
part of the story… if drama becomes the only
thing mainstream media covers
and the only thing we hold up, what can we expect to grow from it? 

With Beauty In Hell I
want to to express, through artistic sensibility, exactly the opposite
and show that beauty within the human spirit is always present, in every
situation, even in the most difficult and dangerous realities around the world.


Find and follow us: Official Website | Twitter | Facebook | Instagram

BEAUTY IN HELL was born as a dream, and I’ve spent the last 3 years developing it, injecting all of my passion and experience in to
it, and dealing with the associated risks and dangers.



In 2011 I started the project by researching and
documenting everyday situations in Vietnam, Kenya and Nepal .


In 2012-13 I documented beauty inside the frightening
realities of the Mathare and Kibera slums (Nairobi, Kenya), of the refugee camps in
North Kenya and other hard situations in the Middle East and Asia (more info and a backstage video about Mathare and Kibera Slums at the end of this page).


Last year BEAUTY IN HELL received several
international awards and was exhibited in venues around the world (more info and a video about the awards and the exhibitions at the end of this page).


This recognition has helped me realize that, maybe, we are finally
ready to see things from a different perspective … THAT OF BEAUTY! And not just
through the lens of drama, which breeds fear, which in turn breeds drama... a vicious circle that needs to be exposed and stopped!

Starting next January, and during
the course of 2015, I will be documenting the beauty in difficult and dangerous
realities across Asia. At the moment the selected stages are in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Myamar, Bangladesh, Nepal/Tibet, China/Mongolia. 

Unfortunately, it is not possible for me
to explain exactly where, when and what the exact situations are. As I am sure you will understand, for
reasons concerning security, safety and to avoid further risks for both 
me and my guides, these situations cannot be revealed until they have 
been fully documented and the work is finished.It is essential that each and every
situation develops in a spontaneous, true and natural way… and one of the
best ways to do this is to come across them unexpectedly, in order to find the
story while you are there, directly from the local people and everyday situations. 





Beauty In Hell is an ongoing project, and this is our first IndieGoGo
campaign developed to raise the funds needed to
produce the new artwork for the BEAUTY IN HELL Photographic Exhibition that
will be held in galleries and venues around the world in 2015-16. At
present we have received availability from venues in Venice, Milan, Switzerland
& USA (we will keep you informed of new venues with regular updates).
The final objective remains that of
informing and raising awareness of these desperate situations, but at the same time we
want to do so in a different way... we are committed to showing that beauty, humanity and real people matter… not just
drama! This is what we believe defines all of
us.





First of all, we ask you to believe in us and in the Project, as we
do. To accomplish the next step, to be able to travel
to the locations, document and show you new realities, we now need external support too… YOUR SUPPORT! 

If you love photography, if you
care about independent photojournalism or if you simply appreciate what BEAUTY IN HELL stands
for, we hope you will join us in
our attempt to show the power of Beauty over drama and sensationalism! Help us recognize
that Beauty! that Humanity! and the truth that real people matter!

EVERY SINGLE DONATION REALLY COUNTS… EVEN SMALL
ONES ARE VITAL!

We ask
for the support of the press, from photographers, from editors, from
educators and schools, from professionals in every field… You are the recommendations we need and count upon!



Each
Contributor will support the project in two parallel ways: 



On an artistic and personal level: by helping us develop the new Artwork for the
traveling Exhibition.


On a social, educational and cultural level: by exposing frequently
overlooked  realities and bringing
awareness to difficult situations around the world.

At the same time every Contributor will receive one or more of our artistic
reward and become a collector too (see perks and rewards in the next chapters). 

In fact,
the Unique Copy & Limited Edition Prints from last year’s campaign have now become collectors' items. For
more info and details please visit:

(articles & news about my work)- http://beautyinhell.com/exhibitions (Awards & Exhibitions page)- http://tonycorocher.com/beauty-in-hell-prints (Details about the Fine Art Prints)
I believe that we can’t ask you for donations
if we are not also willing to personally invest
in this project. We put our own money, work, experience, resources, passion
and knowledge in to it, and 
will be
doing the rest of the work ourselves. 

WHAT WE NEED NOW IS TO RAISE AT LEAST 30 THOUSAND US$ WITHIN THE FIRST DAYS OF FEBRUARY 2015 in order to pay for flights/travel,
living costs, documents, visas, local guides, medical/safety requirements and
insurance for 2 people, plus the live costs of production on location,
registration to  international awards and costs for the
photographic Exhibitions. The realistic
amount needed to cover a project like this and
ensure a professional, high quality output, is approximately 50 thousand US$. 

A large chunk
of this sum (20,000 US$) has already been covered by us and our work (initial research, editing & post-production, social networks, hosting, website,
equipment and more).




IMPORTANT: This budget does not include any compensation for us. All donations
will be used only to finance, support and complete the project.The
process is very simple! Just select the perk you prefer and click on it! You will be taken to a details
page. From here follw the online instructions:

WHO AM I Tony Corocher (Treviso, Italy – 1974) – 
Documentary/Fine Art photographer & Art Director based in Italy. 
I’ve spent the last 20 years switching between graphic design and 
photography while working in different locations around the world. In 
the last 2 years my photographic work (documenting humanitarian 
situations) has been recognized by various international awards and 
exhibited in venues around the world. For a full BIO and more info 
please refer to:Personal Website | LinkedIn | Facebook | Download CV/Resumè THE TEAMThe team behind BEAUTY IN HELL
 is composed by a few very special individuals. People with professional
 backgrounds in different fields who believed in me and in the project 
from the very start. These individuals, also personal friends of mine, 
have sustained me in many different ways and helped develop the project 
over the years.
For a full list of International Awards, Prices & Exhibitions obtained by the Beauty In Hell Project during 2013-2014 click here.Giving up the safety and comfort of my home to go
into these difficult situations is not an easy task and the risks involved are quite high. But when I look back
at the work produced in the last 2-3 years in Africa (www.beautyinhell.com) and the recognitions obtained, I know that what
we can bring back and what we’ll be able to show you is well worth the risks
and sacrifices, and maybe, will help us understand a bit more of what is going
wrong in our modern society.










Beauty In Hell è un reportage indipendente, vincitore di diversi premi
internazionali e, allo stesso tempo, un sogno fotografico personale sviluppato
negli anni con l’obiettivo di trovare e documentare la bellezza presente in
alcune delle realtà più difficili, povere e pericolose al mondo.


Mi chiamo Tony Corocher e sono un fotografo documentarista e fine art.
BEAUTY IN HELL nasce come critica
personale e risposta artistica alla consapevolezza di vivere all’interno di un
sistema che fa uso del dramma in tutto. Noi ormai ci
siamo inconsciamente abituati a considerare una cosa interessante e degna di
nota solo se contiene dei forti contrasti, quindi se è drammatica. 

Senza dramma non c’è notizia e tutto diventa noioso… utilizziamo il dramma
per fare sensazionalismo. Ma il dramma è solo una parte della storia…. se il
dramma diventa la sola cosa che i media ci trasmettono e quindi la sola cosa a
cui facciamo riferimento, che cosa possiamo aspettarci di diverso dal prossimo
futuro?
Con “BEAUTY IN HELL” voglio esprimere,
attraverso la sensibilità artistica, esattamente l’opposto e mostrare che la bellezza dentro lo spirito umano
è sempre presente, in ogni situazione, anche quando le condizioni sono
veramente drammatiche e i luoghi molto duri e difficili.

Potete
seguirci su:Official Website | Twitter | Facebook | Instagram






BEAUTY IN HELL è nato come sogno personale 3 anni fa… è stato sviluppato,
finanziato e portato in mostra con le mie forze iniettandoci tutta la mia
passione e la mia esperienza, e affrontando i rischi e pericoli correlati (e
anche con l’aiuto in vari campi di alcune persone a me vicine in diversi
paesi).

Nel 2011 ho iniziato il progetto svolgendo ricerche
     e raccogliendo documentazione in Vietnam, Kenya e Nepal.
In 2012-13 ho documentato la bellezza dentro le spaventose realtà delle
     baraccopoli di Mathare e Kibera (Nairobi, Kenya), i campi profughi nel
     Nord del Kenya ed altri luoghi molto duri in Medio Oriente ed Asia (più informazioni a
     riguardo ed un video del backstage nelle prossime pagine).

L’anno scorso BEAUTY
     IN HELL ha ricevuto diversi premi internazionali ed è stato esposto in
     diverse sedi in giro per il mondo. (più informazioni ed un video a
     riguardo nelle prossime pagine).


Questi riconoscimenti
mi hanno aiutato a capire che, forse, siamo finalmente pronti a vedere
quello che succede sotto una  luce
diversa… QUELLA DELLA BELLEZZA! non solo attraverso il dramma che produce paura
che produce dramma... un circolo vizioso che deve essere esposto e fermato!



A cominciare dal prossimo
gennaio, e nel corso del 2015, cercherò di documentare la bellezza in realtà
difficili e pericolose all’interno dell’Asia. Al momento le tappe previste sono
Vietnam (dove arriverò il 5 gennaio), Cambodia, Myamar, Bangladesh,
Nepal/Tibet, China/Mongolia… ma sono probabili variazioni durante il percorso.
Sfortunatamente non mi è possibile spiegare con precisione dove, quando e
quali saranno nello specifico i luoghi e le situazioni che incontrerò. Per ragioni
legate alla sicurezza, protezione e per evitare ulteriori rischi sia a me che
alle guide che mi accompagneranno, queste situazioni non possono essere svelate
almeno fino a quando non sono state documentate ed il lavoro completato. 
E’ essenziale che ogni situazione si sviluppi in modo spontaneo, vero e
naturale, e uno dei modi migliori per
farlo è di trovarsi lì inaspettati, quasi per caso, così da trovare la le
immagini e le storie direttamente dalla gente locale.






E’ importante ricordare che BEAUTY IN HELL è un progetto in fase di sviluppo,
creato nel corso degli anni. Il goal di questa fase è di raccogliere i fondi
che mi permettano di produrre il nuovo Artwork per la mostra fotografica che si
terrà nel corso del 2015-16 in gallerie e sedi varie in giro per il mondo. Al momento ho ricevuto disponibilità a Venezia, Milano,
Svizzera e Stati Uniti (vi terremo informati sulle nuove sedi con aggiornamenti
regolari).


L’obiettivo finale rimane sì quello di informare e portare consapevolezza
di queste situazioni, ma allo stesso tempo cercare di farlo in un modo diverso…
ci stiamo impegnando a mostrare che la
bellezza, l’umanità e le persone reali sono la cosa più importante… non solo il
dramma! Questo, credo, è ciò che definisce tutti noi.





Prima di tutto vi chiediamo di 
DI CREDERE IN NOI E NEL PROGETTO. Per portare il Progetto al livello successivo, per raggiungere questi posti,
documentare e mostrare nuove realtà, ORA ABBIAMO NECESSARIAMENTE BISOGNO DI SUPPORTO ESTERNO… DEL VOSTRO SUPPORTO! 
Se amate la fotografia, se vi interessa il fotogiornalismo indipendente o
se semplicemente apprezzate quello che BEAUTY
IN HELL rappresenta, vi chiedo di
unirvi a noi nel tentativo di mostrare la forza della Bellezza sul dramma e sul
sensazionalismo!

OGNI SINGOLO CONTRIBUTO CONTA VERAMENTE TANTO… E, ANCHE SE PICCOLO, E’ DI FONDAMENTALE IMPORTANZA!

Ci serve il supporto della stampa, da parte dei
fotografi, degli editori, degli insegnanti e delle scuole, da parte di tutti i
professionisti in ogni campo… Voi siete le
raccomandazioni di cui abbiamo bisogno e su cui facciamo affidamento!



Ogni Contributore promuoverà lo sviluppo del Progetto su due binari paralleli:



quello artistico e personale: aiutandoci a sviluppare il nuovo Artwork per la Mostra.
     

quello sociale, educativo e culturale: permettendoci di esporre
     realtà spesso trascurate, portando così consapevolezza di situazioni dure
     e difficili nel mondo. 

Allo stesso tempo ogni Contributore riceverà una
ricompensa artistica derivata dall’Artwork finale e diventerà anche un
collezionista (dettagli sulle ricompense nel prossimo paragrafo). Infatti
le stampe in Copia Unica ed in Edizione Limitata dell’anno scorso sono ora
diventate articoli da collezione. Per maggiori informazioni e dettagli vi

Non credo sia
corretto chiedervi contributi e donazioni se noi, per primi, non siamo pronti
ad investire sul progetto di tasca nostra. Abbiamo già messo i nostri soldi, molto lavoro, l’esperienza,
le risorse, la passione e le conoscenze, e faremo tutto il resto del lavoro con
i nostri mezzi.
QUELLO DI CUI ORA ABBIAMO BISOGNO È DI RACCOGLIERE 30.000 US$ ENTRO GLI INIZI DI FEBBRAIO 2015 per
riuscire a pagare voli, trasporti, vitto ed alloggio, documenti, visti, guide ed
assicurazioni, visite mediche per 2 persone, più coprire i costi di produzione
sul posto, di registrazione ai premi internazionali e per preparare/organizzare
le Mostre.La cifra realistica per coprire un progetto come questo e assicurare un
prodotto finale professionale e di alta qualità, è di circa 50.000 US$, e
ovviamente coltiviamo la speranza di raggiungere quella cifra. Comunque una grossa parte di questa somma è
già stata coperta da noi e dal nostro lavoro (20.000 US$ per: ricerche
iniziali, editing & post production, social networks, sito web, hosting, attrezzatura
e altro ancora).
IMPORTANTE: Questo budget non comprende nessuna forma di retribuzione economica
per noi. Tutte le donazioni verranno utilizzate per finanziare, supportare e
completare il progetto.

Il processo è molto semplice! Selezionate la
Ricompensa/Perk che più vi aggrada e cliccateci sopra. Verrete portati su una pagina
di dettaglio. Da qui seguite le indicazioni: 
1. cliccare su “CONTINUE TO PAYMENT”
2. Cliccare su “GO TO PAYPAL”  Una volta arrivati sulla pagina Paypal potrete mandare il contributo
attraverso il vostro conto Paypal oppure utilizzando la vostra carta di
credito. TUTTO IL PROCESSO E’ PROTETTO, MOLTO SICURO E VERAMENTE FACILE. 

La piattaforma INDIEGOGO è certificata 
 TRUSTe Certified,

membro accreditato del 
 Better Business Bureau (BBB)

 2012.

</div></div>","Why A Coffee Table Photo Book?
 
A coffee table is universally at the center of conversation. Literally. And the books on it are picked up and read by Christian and agnostic alike. We have visited some of the most desolate parts of the world and have seen things that we simply cannot un-see. Just before launching on this mission trip, William purchased a camera ""just in case I wanted to take a couple pictures."" Photography has now turned into a passion and over the last five months he has been afforded the opportunity to document some of God's most incredible warriors.While photography is also an interest of Sarah's, her passion lies more in writing. The experiences from the past five months have exploded within her words and stories that no longer should be left hidden in remote villages in India or buried in the heart of the weathered traveler.It is our hope that this photo book, compiled of at least 20 pages of William's photography and Sarah's stories from 11 countries, will spark a conversation between Christians and non-Christians alike. You never know who might pick it up.Previous to the World Race, both William and Sarah lived in America, she on the Oregon coast and he in New York City. Through a fantastic and crazy roller coaster (to put it simply), both were whisked off on an 11-month mission trip to 11 different countries called the World Race. No, this is not televised and it is NOT like the ""Amazing Race.""

We are halfway through the Race now and so far we have walked the plunging valleys below Mount Everest in Nepal, have ducked into huts made from palmetto branches in India, have laughed with awesome men and women in one of Thailand's last remaining government protected leprosy colonies, have lived with and taught English to 51 orphans in Cambodia, and have passed out over 400 cabbages (yes, cabbages) at one of Swaziland's care points which aids over 6,000 local African children, 60% of which are HIV/AIDS positive.

Now we're ready to share these stories. 




 Why $4,000? We each have a financial deadline of $16,264 by January 1st, 2015.  William recently found out he is fully funded (*fist pump*) but Sarah is still in need of $1,740. If she does not reach this deadline, she will have to leave the Race early. These photobooks are a way you can help her stay on the Race and go to Botswana in January!
We have found a book publisher who has given us the following rates for a premium coffee table photo album with the following qualities:

 Standard Landscape 10"" x 8""
 Dust Jacket Cover

 Standard Black Linen Covering (Hardback Cover)

 At least 20 pages of glossy printed photography
 Short descriptions accompanying various photos telling the location

The more photo books sold, the lower production costs will be leading to a higher net going into our World Race accounts. Here are the rates the book publisher has given for the above qualities:


QUANTITY  
PRICE PER COPY


1-9
US $30.99


10-50
US $27.89


51-100
US $26.34


101-300
US $24.79


Assuming that each person donates only the minimum of $50 for a hardback photo album and assuming that at least 10 - 50 people purchase a photo book, then $21.66 goes straight to our support accounts for each book sold.

Each book we sell will get a personalized thank you note from us on the inside cover. (We will contact you beforehand to confirm the photo book is not a gift for another.)

If we raise the funds needed, we land back on American soil on June 1st, 2015. We will work the month of June to get the photo album ready for print by July 1st and mailed out by August 1st.







The Impact

 ALL PROFITS will go to our support accounts. This means that with every book purchase, we are that much closer to staying on the Race until the official end date of June 1st.
This is a dream that you can help make happen. Like we said, a coffee table is universally at the center of conversation. It's our dream that through this photobook, a conversation between Christians and non-Christians can be sparked.

<p> </p>
<p>This album is my chance of sharing with you my interpretations of <strong>how we </strong><strong>perceive ourselves and others</strong>, which I am going to separate into three different angles:</p>
<p>             </p>
<p><strong>Surviving - </strong>A lack of self-esteem pushes people to prove themselves to others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Existing - </strong>A lack of appreciation by others causes people to question the purpose of their existence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Living - </strong>Accepting oneself, and a stable focus on one's happiness. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These angles deal with different manifestations of our perceptions and feelings of superiority, and I am also integrating the component of animals by reversing roles to explore those experiences. <strong>The above angles I shall categorize into three individual sections in the book.</strong></p>
<p>During this exploration, I will, among other elements, play around with <strong>metaphors and idioms</strong> that represent our customary perceptions, and I will turn them on their head in order to unearth a different POV.</p>

</h3><h3> </h3><h3><strong>„You always find a way to make your day a little brighter.“ </strong></h3><p>Wien, Europa, die Welt – jeder Platz unseres Planeten steckt voller Geheimnisse, Schlupfwinkel und unentdeckter Perspektiven. Als Fotograf sehe ich es als meine Berufung, solche Orte ausfindig zu machen, zu dokumentieren und somit Teil der Zeitgeschichte zu werden. Dabei geht es sehr stark darum, die Orte spürbar zu machen, das Gefühl einzufangen, Eindrücke zu vermitteln, Plätzen Leben einzuhauchen und so Gedankenspiele anzuregen. Eine Aufgabe, die für mich das Zusammenspiel mit dem Ort zum Hauptfokus gemacht hat, die Liebe zu Wien, dem unerschöpflich kreativen Potential dieser Stadt, wachsen lassen hat und die Idee eines Bildbandes entstehen ließ.</p><p><strong>Eine Ode an Wien also! </strong>Ein Bildband, der 10 verschiedene Areale in Zusammenarbeit mit 10 verschiedenen Models in den Blickpunkt rückt, um Charakteristiken festzuhalten, Horizonte zu erweitern und dazu inspirieren soll, mit neugierigen und offenen Augen durchs Leben zu ziehen. Vom Böhmischen Prater bis nach Nussdorf, von der Großfeldsiedlung bis zu den Steinhofgründen, jeder Ort ist einzigartig und lebt für sich, doch gemeinsam bilden sie eine eindrucksvolle Gesamtperspektive dieser Stadt. Dein/mein/unser/euer Wien.</p><p><strong>Plätze und Inhalte: </strong>Böhmischen Prater, Großfeldsiedlung, Wien Nacht, Sightseeing-Tour durch Wien, Otto Wagner, Wiener Prater, Kaisermühlen, die 6er Linie, Seestadt, Steinhof.</p><p><strong>An meiner Seite: </strong>Sarah Walder, Maja Petrovic, Dajanka Kuban, Christa Wackenreuther, Natália Muchová, Julia Schwarz, Doris Kemptner, Viktória Orlicka, Iris Shala, Katerina Polakova.</p><p><strong>Texte zu den Kapitel von: </strong>Anna Ullrich, Darija Kasalo, Andrea Heyer, Fabolus Vienna, Gini Liedl, Stil Laden Wien, Martin Tardy (Viereck), Andi Joska, Stefan Wessel.</p><p><strong>Fakten über das Buch:</strong></p><ul>

Als Fotograf sehe ich es als meine Berufung, solche Orte ausfindig zu machen, zu dokumentieren und somit Teil der Zeitgeschichte zu werden. Dabei geht es sehr stark darum, die Orte spürbar zu machen, das Gefühl einzufangen, Eindrücke zu vermitteln, Plätzen Leben einzuhauchen und so Gedankenspiele anzuregen. Eine Aufgabe, die für mich das Zusammenspiel mit dem Ort zum Hauptfokus gemacht hat, die Liebe zu Wien, dem unerschöpflich kreativen Potential dieser Stadt, wachsen lassen hat und die Idee eines Bildbandes entstehen ließ.Eine Ode an Wien also! Ein Bildband, der 10 verschiedene Areale in Zusammenarbeit mit 10 verschiedenen Models in den Blickpunkt rückt, um Charakteristiken festzuhalten, Horizonte zu erweitern und dazu inspirieren soll, mit neugierigen und offenen Augen durchs Leben zu ziehen. Vom Böhmischen Prater bis nach Nussdorf, von der Großfeldsiedlung bis zu den Steinhofgründen, jeder Ort ist einzigartig und lebt für sich, doch gemeinsam bilden sie eine eindrucksvolle Gesamtperspektive dieser Stadt.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Thanks to my graphic design training and experience in corporate publishing -  design, writing and editing won't cost any money, but the biggest expense will be printing. Here's how I think the budget will break down:<br/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">          Image preparation (canning, colour correction, etc): apx $1,500</span></p>

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">This is flexible funding campaign, so if I don't raise the full amount, the book will still happen - it will take longer and probably will be on the modest side as far as number of pages and images is concerned. So here I go - trying to get you excited - telling you about the wonderful perks I've thought up in hopes of making your minds moist with motivation.</span><br/></p>

The first photograph I have from this alley dates back to 1989 - it was already in full swing visually. Struck by its 'art installation' vibe, I became enamored with it's ever changing imagery, rough and ready attitude, and a full range of human emotion – liberally applied to its walls, doorways …
Project

After more then 20 years of interacting with this weird and wonderful creature, I feel its time to take stock - mark the passage of time. Create a visual document that celebrates this landmark, which, for all its visual incarnations, remains remarkably unchanged - in its architecture as well as function. This alleyway needs to be acknowledged - it has contributed greatly to the flavour of downtown Toronto, and will continue to do so for years - decades to come!



Where your contributions will go
I envision this book to be about 60 to 90 pages (depending on your generosity). Full colour and roughly 8""x10"" in size. Because for the first decade of this project, I was shooting on film, there are thousands of negatives (in 35mm and mid-format) to go through. I am hoping to digitize at least 100 of the best ones. I also have a few thousand digital images that have been reduced to around 300 at this point.
Thanks to my graphic design training and experience in corporate publishing -  design, writing and editing won't cost any money, but the biggest expense will be printing. Here's how I think the budget will break down:
          Image preparation (canning, colour correction, etc): apx $1,500
          Production / printing: apx $6,500
This is flexible funding campaign, so if I don't raise the full amount, the book will still happen - it will take longer and probably will be on the modest side as far as number of pages and images is concerned. So here I go - trying to get you excited - telling you about the wonderful perks I've thought up in hopes of making your minds moist with motivation.

Perks

To begin with - you can have the entire book (in pdf form) for the smallest contribution of $5! As well as having your name mentioned in the 'thank you' section … a pretty good deal, no?!

Here are the samples of greeting cards, your $10 contribution gets:




Your $15 contribution will get you a limited edition (of 100), archival 8""x10"" print of this image:

<p><strong>My Background &amp; The Book's Genesis </strong></p>
<p>For most of my life, I have been involved with producing and managing artistic endeavors for predominantly music projects. My main client over the last 18 years (!) has been the indie-rock group <a href=""http://applesinstereo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Apples in stereo</a>, but I've worked on the marketing, promotion, and development of dozens of music albums, television programs and live music productions. </p>
<p>In 2016, I curated <i>Modular Synthesis</i>, two shows for the painter Steve Keene. One was at the Brooklyn Public Library, the other at Shepard Fairey's Los Angeles gallery, <a href=""https://subliminalprojects.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Subliminal Projects</a>. </p>
<p><strong><i>My world has seemingly always involved being around creative minds with both serious and not-so-serious creative visions.  </i></strong></p>
<p><i>The longer story, a little sad and hopefully a little uplifting...</i></p>
<p>In 2008, my mother became seriously ill and it had a profound effect on my career and lifelong objectives. At the same time, my desire to pursue more personal creative endeavors came to light, while I still had the energy to do so. During this period, I had increasingly less personal time, and I needed to make it count. If I had 30 minutes to spare, I needed to get away from the pressures of caring for the family. One day,  I picked up a camera and got to lose myself in the moment. Photography became my go-to for cleansing my brain of the weight of family illness and care - which had become a full-time job.</p>
<p>After my parents had both passed and I was done taking care of family legal obligations, I traveled to Europe, the first time I had been able to get away in years. I hoped it would take my mind off of the dark realities that had occupied my world. It turned out to be a life changer. </p>
<p>On that trip, I took a lot of photos and got into an excellent regimen each day of really studying what I was capturing. Everyone knows, when you want to hone your skills at anything, repetition is key. Practice! That Summer, I took literally thousands of photos, each day, going home and analyzing what was taken. Though it was fun, it was also bordering on compulsive. </p>
<p>Upon my return to NYC, I showed some shots to my friend Deb Caponera who curates a wonderful cafe' series in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, who was nice enough to ask me if I was interested in showing my work. Another friend, Andrea, ended up offering me opportunities to show my art in a similar way at the restaurant she worked at in Warwick, NY.  </p>
<p>These were inspiring times and I am forever grateful. Without any expectations at all, I sold a bunch of prints and more importantly, realized I was hooked creatively. A year later, I was fortunate to have a show at Howl Happening in the East Village. My friends Ron Ward &amp; The Dream Lovers played improvised music to my abstract films and stills.  The show involved making three, 45 min films that showed concurrently. A ton of work, but with an amazing outcome! Specifically inspired by this event, Ron Ward &amp; The Dream Lovers recorded an album with producer/guitarist Jon Spencer. Inspiring stuff! </p>
<p><strong>What Photography Means To Me</strong></p>
<p>Looking back on this period, I never expected anything from photography, but it has given me so much. Most importantly, it's now my inspiration, something I was lacking for a few years. We all need to dream. In dark times - like the last 2 years - it has been very important to find inspiration.  Because of photography, I feel like I've made a creative comeback, a rebirth if you will. </p>
<p>Because I'm ambitious and don't like to make things easy for myself,  this project is not simply a photo book, it's a campaign that includes the limited edition book, prints &amp; postcards, a potential gallery premiere show and distributing the book to a large group of galleries and festival curators around the world. <i>Every book that you purchase, goes toward the printing and distribution of another book to an influencer around the globe! </i></p>
<p>(Psst: As mentioned way above this, my ultimate goal is to get the attention of the curators of The Rencontres d'Arles which is perhaps the most prestigious photography festival in the world and with the intent of showing there at some point in the future. Attending the  festival in 2015 was a huge inspiration for me.)</p>
<p>Dreams are important. This is mine. There are a variety of pieces and packages available for pre-purchase. If you like my work, I want to make it accessible and fairly priced. I've read that supporting these campaigns early is really important to its ultimate success. So choosing to support it early will offer an even better deal. As an early adopter,  (re: ""early bird deals""), you are raising your hand at an important time for this campaign's success.</p>
<p><strong>Goals include:</strong></p>
<p>* Printing of the limited edition, first edition<br/>* Sending copies to backers<br/>* Making archival prints<br/>* Distributing the book to international curators and tastemakers<br/>* Promoting the book with online and print reviews and/or PR<br/>* Extended goal: potentially create a pop-up show in the NYC area (a big stretch but you never know)</p>
<p>It means a lot that people want to help this campaign. The broader the number of supporters  (on any level) will help reach the people in power in the art world. </p>

I am targeting locations that represent a diversity of natural environments

melting Arctic ice cap to wild fires in Australia, I have selected places that
will represent how geographically widespread the climate crisis is. Through a
blog during my travels as well as exhibitions and slideshow presentations when
I return to the States, I hope to create awareness and inspire others to be

<p>Many experts in the field of environmental science agree that the
earth is warming and that humans are largely responsible. (For more information on climate change please see link below.) The more I learned about
climate change the more I knew I wanted to respond as an artist to this issue
and that’s how <i>The Witness Tree </i>was
born.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p><p><b>What is a Witness Tree, you may ask?</b><br/></p>
<p>By tradition, a witness tree is used in land surveying to mark a
property corner that cannot be reached because it lies off a cliff or in a body
of water. The term also refers to trees that have witnessed historic events;
i.e. an old honey locust that existed during the battle of Gettysburg. I
will be photographing many trees that are observing the changes in the land
around them.  In essence, my eyes and my camera will also be witnesses and
the resulting pictures will act as permanent documents of these precious and
precarious environments.<br/></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p><b>In the Beginning …</b><br/></p>
<p>I was first inspired to begin this project while <a href=""http://carolynmonastra.com/cm/WT_jok_4.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Iceland"">Iceland</a> on an
artist’s residency and noted the increase in the melting of their glaciers since my previous visit there several years before. After doing a significant amount of research this past year I
started photographing locations in the US such as <a href=""http://carolynmonastra.com/cm/WT_LE9.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Lake Erie"">Lake Erie</a>, whose water level
has declined over 3 feet in the past fifteen years and the <a href=""http://carolynmonastra.com/cm/WT_PT2.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""lodge pole pines"">lodge pole pines</a> in
Colorado that are being decimated by the pine beetle which has survived milder
winters to attack the drought-weakened trees in greater force. In order to
fully respond to and depict this crisis I plan to travel to targeted locations around
the globe (see links below). I recognize that most methods of travel involve
adding more carbon to the atmosphere. This is a concern for me but I weighed
the factors and decided that this project is a worthy pursuit. I have been
granted a yearlong sabbatical from Nassau Community College where I am a
fulltime professor of photography. This gift of time to work is very important
but I also need your support to help make this happen.</p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p><b>This is where Indiegogo and you come in</b><br/></p>
<p>I know this is an ambitious endeavor but I am wholly committed to it
as I feel very passionate about the environment and I hope you do too. 
It’s the only world we have and the shifts in the climate we’ve been
experiencing are getting pretty scary.<br/></p>
<p>I have been saving my pennies, selling my artwork, shooting
freelance jobs and applying for grants in order to raise funds for this
project. I hope that those who are interested in environmental issues and/or
just want to support my art will consider making a donation. My perks start at
$15 but you can give just a $1 or $5 if you want. Your financial assistance
will go toward my travel expenses (transportation, lodging, meals) and making
work prints of the images when I return.<br/></p>
<p>I travel very inexpensively and with as little impact as
possible (I prefer bikes to cars, camping to fancy hotels) but any of you who
have gotten on a plane recently know that the cost of travel has gone up. I
plan to travel contiguously to keep costs and my carbon footprint down as much
as possible and will purchase carbon offsets for the miles I fly. When possible
I hope to take trains or buses instead of planes.<br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Hooray! Tax deductions! </b><br/></p>
<p>I am very grateful to have Fractured Atlas acting as my fiscal
sponsor. Since they are a 501c3 nonprofit they can bestow tax deduction letters
in return for your contribution (see “Perks” box to right for thank-you gifts
and each level’s tax deductible amount). I have a “working” itinerary of sites
I want to visit but the more funds I can raise, the more places I can
photograph.<br/></p>
<p>Whether you make a donation or not, one way you can help is by
sending along the link to this campaign to your family, friends, coworkers, or
favorite bloggers who you think might be interested in The Witness Tree.
Or if you know of someone in my targeted locations who can offer me some advice
or a couch to sleep on, that information is very valuable too. And, last but
not least, if any of you are interested in joining me for part of my trip, drop
me a note!</p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p>Feel free to write me with any questions. And please send this on to folks you think you might be interested in this project. Thank you for your
support!<br/></p>

$15 but you can give just a $1 or $5 if you want. Your financial assistance
will go toward my travel expenses (transportation, lodging, meals) and making
work prints of the images when I return.
I travel very inexpensively and with as little impact as
possible (I prefer bikes to cars, camping to fancy hotels) but any of you who
have gotten on a plane recently know that the cost of travel has gone up. I
plan to travel contiguously to keep costs and my carbon footprint down as much
as possible and will purchase carbon offsets for the miles I fly. When possible
I hope to take trains or buses instead of planes.
Hooray! Tax deductions! 
I am very grateful to have Fractured Atlas acting as my fiscal
sponsor. Since they are a 501c3 nonprofit they can bestow tax deduction letters
in return for your contribution (see “Perks” box to right for thank-you gifts
and each level’s tax deductible amount). I have a “working” itinerary of sites
I want to visit but the more funds I can raise, the more places I can
photograph.
Whether you make a donation or not, one way you can help is by
sending along the link to this campaign to your family, friends, coworkers, or
favorite bloggers who you think might be interested in The Witness Tree.
Or if you know of someone in my targeted locations who can offer me some advice
or a couch to sleep on, that information is very valuable too. And, last but
not least, if any of you are interested in joining me for part of my trip, drop
me a note!
 
Feel free to write me with any questions. And please send this on to folks you think you might be interested in this project. Thank you for your
support!

<h3>In the past 12 months I have travelled and lived in 24 countries. Within this time I have met people that have hitch-hiked to meet their neighbours on the other side of the globe, shared homes with friends who have skateboarded over 400km across Morocco and met artists that paint every day, dreamers that live in vans, entrepreneurs that have created their own world within this one. </h3>
<p>As a British artist, more now than ever I question my own identity and nationality. I believe I am more than a stereotype set by my place of birth and instead an amalgamation of the places and people I have experienced. This exhibition shares images from my trip but also in displaying these images allows other to question their own stories, identities and to look beyond them to lives that are far than ordinary.</p>
<p>I choose to photograph using natural life and try to capture as close to how I see the world as possible. These are moments that I long to share with you. </p>
<p>As an artist it is not always easy to reach the people that need to see your work most. To get funding can be difficult and not seen as an essential expense to donate to. But I believe we all need to dream a little more, experience fresh perspectives and share our own stories. These photos are close to my heart but by funding this exhibition I hope they will help both you and others. </p>

<p>My name is Farizah Sedek. I have been living and working in the Czech Republic for the past five years. Last year, after four years of working with a local company, I decided to take the plunge to pursue my dream of building a business.</p>
<p>I am graphic designer by day; I've designed for companies big and small since 2005. However, at night I find myself sifting through my digital library of photographs, looking for that one photo to work on. I would bring my camera with me wherever I go and I would spend countless hours reading or watching videos on post-processing methods, refining my style.</p>
<p>Photography is where my heart is. When the camera that I have been shooting with was taken away from me (more on that story below) just at the time when I started getting serious about business, I thought professional photography was something I should shelve for a while. But when you feel it's your calling, <b>you really can't ignore it,</b> can you? So, while my iPhone is wonderful for capturing the beauty I see in things, I know that to go pro, I'll need to invest in a new DSLR. Pronto.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #cc0000;""><b>THE BACKSTORY</b></h1>
<p>In 2009, I received a hand-me-down DSLR from the local company that I was working with. They were replacing it with a new one, and I was more than happy to inherit the camera. Yes, it was given to me as a gift. Or so they said.</p>
<p>In 2013, I left the company to pursue my dream of building a business. Little did I know, by an unfortunate turn of events, I was accused of keeping company property and, not wanting to have any negative energies mar my fledgling business, decided to give the camera back.</p>
<p>Maybe I should actually say it was a fortunate turn of events. Cos now I get to buy my own brand new DSLR. Positive thinking begets positive outcomes, right?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #cc0000;""><b>THE IDEA</b></h1>
<p>I'm an INFJ. If you're unfamiliar with the Myers-Briggs type profiles, INFJs need a strong sense of intention behind everything they do. Every little thing we do, we question the purpose of doing it. Yes, it's both our gift and our bane. So, as much as I love photography and want to turn my photographic gifts into my vocation, still I question my intentions for it. What is the bigger picture here? What do I want to achieve with photography, other than simply making pretty pictures? Is there a higher purpose for me to go into it? <b><i>What is my big why?</i></b></p>
<p>As I ponder on those questions, out of the blue, an idea surfaced amongst all of these thoughts floating around in my head, and I knew instantly that this is something I have been called to do.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic is my adopted home, and its people are my friends. Nevertheless, I came into this world rooted as a Malay-Muslim from a tiny country in South-east Asia. While Singapore herself has grown into a giant with large infrastructures majestically depicted in postcard-worthy photographs, not very much still is known about my culture, the Malay-Muslims, especially in this country who has had its doors closed for much of the 20th century due to confining ideologies.</p>
<p><b>My mission is to change that.</b> And this is where your contribution matters.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #cc0000;""><b>THE PROJECT</b></h1>
<p>My first planned exhibition will be <b>to show my culture (Malay-Muslims) and the beautiful countries we inhabit (Malaysia and Singapore) to the people in my adopted home (the Czech Republic).</b></p>
<p>I am particularly interested in <b>showing my perspective on how the Malay-Muslims in Singapore live and celebrate</b> their auspicious days, and present this to a people who quite likely has little or no prior knowledge on the Malays and our ways. I think this will be a fresh introduction for them, besides the tired durian-and-boat-on-a-building architecture of a typical photo of Singapore. :)</p>
<p>I planned this exhibition for next year in Spring. In July this year, I 
will be going to Singapore during the Eid holiday celebration, where I 
will do most of the shooting. The one-year period will give me ample 
time to <b>storyboard, shoot, post-process, print and mount, market, and do all the other necessary preparations.</b></p>
<p>I intend to open the exhibition in conjunction with the local <b>Multi-cultural Week event</b> here which attracts both local and foreign visitors from across the country. Potentially, if this is a success, I will want to <b>take this exhibition to the capital city itself, the gorgeous Prague.</b> I will also want to put the photographs in a <b>limited edition pictorial coffee table book.</b></p>
<p><b>Your contribution, big or small, will help to set these gears in motion.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #cc0000;""><b>WHAT I NEED</b></h1>
<p>First and foremost is a new DSLR. The camera that I plan to get is the Nikon D5300. It's a mid-range DSLR, and currently costs about 730 EUR / 990 USD in the Czech market. I already have some Nikkor lenses that I was using with the ex-camera, so buying a Nikon body is the obvious choice for me.</p>
<p>A tripod - Velbon Sherpa 803RD - costing 180 EUR / 250 USD.</p>
<p>A return flight ticket for the trip costing anywhere from 730 EUR to 1100 EUR.</p>
<p>The rest of the funding will go to printing, mounting, framing, booking a venue, and getting the word out, as well as in fulfilling your ""perks"". I will use it to print business cards, posters, invites, hire pr and social media tweeters, and possibly other ways my creative mind can think of!!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #cc0000;""><b>WHAT WILL YOU GET FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION</b></h1>
<p>Indiegogo allows me to set up ""perks"" that I can give to you for the contributions that you make. You can see it as a little ""push"", in a good way. :) It's also the ways that I can say Thank You for supporting me on this journey. There are different types of ""perks"" that I can offer for the different levels of contribution, but these are not set in stone. You can change the amount of your contribution in the next page, and whether big or small, <b>I still thank you from the bottom of my heart.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 16px; color: #cc0000;""><b>MY PHOTOGRAPHY</b></h1>

In 2009, I received a hand-me-down DSLR from the local company that I was working with. They were replacing it with a new one, and I was more than happy to inherit the camera. Yes, it was given to me as a gift. Or so they said.
In 2013, I left the company to pursue my dream of building a business. Little did I know, by an unfortunate turn of events, I was accused of keeping company property and, not wanting to have any negative energies mar my fledgling business, decided to give the camera back.
Maybe I should actually say it was a fortunate turn of events. Cos now I get to buy my own brand new DSLR. Positive thinking begets positive outcomes, right?

THE IDEA
I'm an INFJ. If you're unfamiliar with the Myers-Briggs type profiles, INFJs need a strong sense of intention behind everything they do. Every little thing we do, we question the purpose of doing it. Yes, it's both our gift and our bane. So, as much as I love photography and want to turn my photographic gifts into my vocation, still I question my intentions for it. What is the bigger picture here? What do I want to achieve with photography, other than simply making pretty pictures? Is there a higher purpose for me to go into it? What is my big why?
As I ponder on those questions, out of the blue, an idea surfaced amongst all of these thoughts floating around in my head, and I knew instantly that this is something I have been called to do.
The Czech Republic is my adopted home, and its people are my friends. Nevertheless, I came into this world rooted as a Malay-Muslim from a tiny country in South-east Asia. While Singapore herself has grown into a giant with large infrastructures majestically depicted in postcard-worthy photographs, not very much still is known about my culture, the Malay-Muslims, especially in this country who has had its doors closed for much of the 20th century due to confining ideologies.
My mission is to change that. And this is where your contribution matters.

THE PROJECT
My first planned exhibition will be to show my culture (Malay-Muslims) and the beautiful countries we inhabit (Malaysia and Singapore) to the people in my adopted home (the Czech Republic).
I am particularly interested in showing my perspective on how the Malay-Muslims in Singapore live and celebrate their auspicious days, and present this to a people who quite likely has little or no prior knowledge on the Malays and our ways. I think this will be a fresh introduction for them, besides the tired durian-and-boat-on-a-building architecture of a typical photo of Singapore. :)
I planned this exhibition for next year in Spring. In July this year, I 
will be going to Singapore during the Eid holiday celebration, where I 
will do most of the shooting. The one-year period will give me ample 
time to storyboard, shoot, post-process, print and mount, market, and do all the other necessary preparations.
I intend to open the exhibition in conjunction with the local Multi-cultural Week event here which attracts both local and foreign visitors from across the country. Potentially, if this is a success, I will want to take this exhibition to the capital city itself, the gorgeous Prague. I will also want to put the photographs in a limited edition pictorial coffee table book.
Your contribution, big or small, will help to set these gears in motion.

WHAT I NEED
First and foremost is a new DSLR. The camera that I plan to get is the Nikon D5300. It's a mid-range DSLR, and currently costs about 730 EUR / 990 USD in the Czech market. I already have some Nikkor lenses that I was using with the ex-camera, so buying a Nikon body is the obvious choice for me.
A tripod - Velbon Sherpa 803RD - costing 180 EUR / 250 USD.
A return flight ticket for the trip costing anywhere from 730 EUR to 1100 EUR.
The rest of the funding will go to printing, mounting, framing, booking a venue, and getting the word out, as well as in fulfilling your ""perks"". I will use it to print business cards, posters, invites, hire pr and social media tweeters, and possibly other ways my creative mind can think of!!

WHAT WILL YOU GET FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION
Indiegogo allows me to set up ""perks"" that I can give to you for the contributions that you make. You can see it as a little ""push"", in a good way. :) It's also the ways that I can say Thank You for supporting me on this journey. There are different types of ""perks"" that I can offer for the different levels of contribution, but these are not set in stone. You can change the amount of your contribution in the next page, and whether big or small, I still thank you from the bottom of my heart.

MY PHOTOGRAPHY
Below are just some images from my photographic journey. These might give you an idea of the photo-documentation that I hope to create.


SPONSORSHIP ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
During the exhibition, as well as later on in the book, I'd like to put up a board to acknowledge you as a contributor, with your names up there, unless you've chosen to contribute anonymously. If you are contributing on behalf of your business, you can choose to have your logo up there.

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN SUPPORT
This project will grow in stages. Right now I'm building on the momentum from the ground up, and calling out to everyone who's on board in their support right from the beginning in this conceptual stage.
If you can’t contribute monetarily, that doesn’t mean you can’t help.
Please send this link along to your friends and family on Facebook, 
twitter or just to your email contacts who you think might be interested in supporting me.
The Indiegogo share tools on this site can help get the word out! Click on the Like button and share it on Facebook. Tweet it and GooglePlus it. These small actions will make a big difference.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>'Women in Contemporary Society' is a photography exhibition organised by SPACE:OCCUPIED, a collective from Edinburgh Napier University. </p>
<p>Our exhibition focuses on the specific issues of form, gender identity, escapism, self representation and gender expression.

We have chosen this particular subject as this a current and topical issue in the present day. Therefore, we felt that as young adults within this society, it would be pertinent to tackle this subject from a variety of perspectives through each of our projects and our specific interests within our chosen theme.  </p>
<p>The funds donated will be used to finance the production of the exhibition.</p>

</ol><p><strong>MANY THANKS!</strong></p></div>","WHO WE ARE? We are experienced travelers, travelled to 40+ countries.We are young and active. And we are so far from typical touristic ways of new places’ exploring. Trying to feel the spirit of each city, we find hidden sites, traditional markets, places for locals, etc. We discovered that every city, country or culture can give you a lot of exciting emotions if you dive in its casual life.We also enjoy making photos. We don't like to make thousands “typical”pictures. One “live” photo can show nation’s specific, beauty of actions or positive emotions. So now we intend to create a dream book with “live” photos. And we believe this project will inspire others to discover the world.OUR PROJECTWe want to collect photo-stories from different countries, but on the same themes, in one book. There will be topics of common life. For example: typical breakfast with a morning newspaper, seller on traditional market, street graffiti. We will talk to local people and add their comments into the book, to make our photos “real”. So everyone’ll be able to see the life through the eyes of citizens of diverse parts of our planet.You can participate in campaign by ordering the book. Also you can try yourself as topic creator or even model. Read perks description for further details.During our project we gather funds only for book release. All expenses for travelling are covered by our own, except rewards for access to “closed photo points” (like roofs or working areas)
Design: $700
Editing: $1 000
Production: $8 600
Charges for expensive topics: $1 500
Indiegogo fees: $590
Total: $12 390
If we don’t collect $12 390 we will decrease quantity of printed books. However, we are sure that our campaign will be successful. Anyway – you will receive your perks with 100% guaranty.You can see the project’s timing below. UNDER THE COVEROur World is as wonderful, as diverse. This will be the keynote of our book.The book includes a few topics. Each theme begins with the blitz-interviews of locals - random passers, workers or any people who ready to talk. We will ask them about interesting and specific facts on selected topics and will try to discover emotional part of life in this concrete region.Interviews will be in two languages - English and Ukrainian.Then there will be photos on the same topic in different regions and countries. We'll use both - our travel experience and information received during the interviews, to find the most impressive moments and places.When you decide to support our campaign, you will join our adventure and become the part of this story about beauty of our planet.

<p>My name is Gloria Ferres, I am a photographer from paraguay, currently based in Milan.  My passion for photography started years ago when I was studying in Boston.  I was living with a writer who had worked for National Geographic.

</h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name's James Emmerson, and I'm a signed model for Aesthetic Clarity Ltd. In my near 8 months with this crazy crew, a hell of a lot has happened, and I've seen them help people grow in so many ways, whether it be through their confidence, their modelling abilities, their social prescence, or any of the above and more.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But in order to continue doing the wonderful jobs they do, Toya Harvey and Emma-Louise Bullions (our primary internal photographers and director/marketing manager respecitively) are in need of new cameras and equipment, and we need your help.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Cameras don't come cheap, and neither does the equipment they require to capture life at its finest quality. To cover the costs of lighting, flash guns, high-end Nikon model cameras, battery packs and lenses, I'm looking to raise about £5,000 for these girls. It's a lot to ask, but I really want to make this happen for them. They've already done so much for so many people, and I hope we can help them continue to do more.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, every penny earned will go towards funding new equipment for Aesthetic Clarity, Ltd. so they can continue to change lives for the better.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Aesthetic Clarity is home to over 50 signed models, from all backgrounds and walks of life, of all shapes and sizes, and all of them have come a long way since they started (myself most definitely included). If we're able to reach our goal, Toya and Emma will be able to continue shooting our models in the highest quality, and help so many more people to grow, both as models and as individuals</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you're unable to contribute financially, you're more than welcome to share the campaign page or the Aesthetic Clarity Facebook page or Twitter feeds, and spread the good word.</div>

Aesthetic Clarity is home to over 50 signed models, from all backgrounds and walks of life, of all shapes and sizes, and all of them have come a long way since they started (myself most definitely included). If we're able to reach our goal, Toya and Emma will be able to continue shooting our models in the highest quality, and help so many more people to grow, both as models and as individuals

Other Ways You Can Help
If you're unable to contribute financially, you're more than welcome to share the campaign page or the Aesthetic Clarity Facebook page or Twitter feeds, and spread the good word.
 
I hope you're interested in this campaign, and am looking forward to seeing how this plays out. AC have done a lot for me since I've met them, and with your help, this would be a wonderful way to pay back the favour.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Can beauty prevail when innocent people are disfigured by acid attacks? Can they rise stronger than before, more empowered and determined?</h3>
<p>Award winning photographer Ken Hermann and videographer Tai Klan<br/> travelled to Bangladesh to answer these questions.</p>
<p>Through the great efforts of the Acid Survivors Foundation (ASF) the numbers of acid attacks have gone down, however Bangladesh is a country<br/> still plagued by acid attacks. In many cases the attack comes from within<br/> the family, mostly due to disputes over honour, dowry, property or land.<br/> Women, men and children are left with the painful physical and mental<br/> scars that stay with them for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>Focusing on the positive and aesthetic aspects of these otherwise tragic<br/> stories, Ken Hermann has created a strong portrait series, while Tai Klan<br/> takes us really close to the portrayed with his moving short documentary. The project was in part realized in collaboration with the ASF in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The complete project will be revealed at the KontraFrame gallery in Copenhagen duringthe annual Copenhagen Photo Festival June 7th 2013.</p>

<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>The money will go towards finishing the editing of the documentary, colorgrading &amp; sound mixing and printing the photographs in a nice (hopefully) big format with framing for the exhibition. Beside that Suzette Frovin (journalist) is working on all the text for the project.</p>
<p>Supporting the project and helping to raise awareness about this worthwhile cause, we have put together some nice perks for you, ranging from 10-400 €. Hopefully you will like them but any donation amount is greatly appreciated.  </p>
<p><strong>Support</strong></p>
<p>We were lucky to get financial support from Amnesty International &amp; The Danish Journalist Union to cover some of the expenses from the trip. </p>
<p>The exhibition and documentary will require a total of 7.500€ to be completed. With 5.500 € pledged we feel confident to start the production and we will then cover the rest ourselves.</p>

<p>If we reach our funding goal, we will ship the exhibition to the Acid Survivor Hospital in Bangladesh to lift up their spirit and let them enjoy the pictures we made together. </p>

<p>If - by chance - this campaign catches wildfire and we raise heaps of cash, we would absolutely love to invite some of the survivors to Copenhagen and show them the exhibition.

I conceived the work in book format from the start and am excited to present it for publication in 2017.  Making of the book mock up, 2016.By contributing to the May Days project you will directly enable the final design, printing, and distribution of the book. The majority of production costs consist of the printing and that’s where we need help. We will print in a small limited first edition of 500. Through our pre-sale of signed copies of the limited edition, and through all the other perks listed, you contribute your funds directly to its production. The production costs:Softcover, 6.75"" x 9"", 106 pages
Text design of book: $300
Production cost, incl. printing and packaging for shipment: $20.82 for each book, total $10,410
Cost of high quality color proof: $15 per page, total $1590
Shipment of 500 copies from printer to US: $1200
Distribution: $1500
Fees for using the Indiegogo campaign service are not included in the overall amount and which I will pay out of pocket.Exhibition prints are available, print size 18x27"", paper size 24x30"" (unframed).The largest challenge for the production of the book is covering the costs of printing. However, the production costs of photography books used to be much more costly, in fact impossible for the majority of photographers. The beauty of the current independent book publishing movement and  access to printers have lowered those costs and made publishing possible for photographers and artists outside the mainstream.Limited edition portfolios, 8x10"" + 13x19"". Archival pigment prints, signed.Please check out the various ways in which you can contribute on this webpage and discover what your rewards are.  Even if we do not reach our entire goal - all contributions matter and make a difference towards publication.  If you are not interested in the rewards, you may also choose other amounts by clicking the Back It button underneath campaign title and to the right of video.If we do not reach the full goal, I am committed to personally fund the remaining expense through affordable loans made available to working artists.Once the book is published we will be able to distribute the monograph to a broader audience, especially to educational institutions and libraries nationwide and in Cuba. I would like to make the book available to communities who would not otherwise have access, instead of viewing the work in gallery settings.Layout, editing and sequencing of the book dummy, 2016.Not all of you will be able to contribute, but there are other ways to help.  Spread the word, you might know of someone who specializes in Caribbean cultural studies or is part of an institution who would have interest in promoting the project. Please use all of the sharing tools we provide here, whichever your preferred platform.Thank you for your interest and consideration for funding. With deep appreciation,Dana",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hey there! My name is Tanya, I'm a photographer who moved to Berlin a year and a half ago. For the second lockdown in Berlin I have started to photograph one stranger in a day to escape the loneliness and to fight the fear to speak with the people on Berlin’s streets. Lockdown was supposed to last only month of November 2020, but it prolonged till the end of January and most probably would be prolonged till the end of the winter.</p>
<p>I’m running out of the money and can’t afford to buy the medium format Kodak film any more. The Personal project turned out to be the documentary  project which captures quite important experience in our lives. If my project ""Strangers"" speaks to you - please support it financially or by sharing the information about it. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>When the second lockdown started in Berlin I decided to create a photography project called “Strangers”.  </p>
<p>The project started as a way to escape two things: my loneliness as a single person who recently moved to a new city and the fear of speaking with people on the streets of Berlin.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Since the 2nd of November, when the second lockdown was announced, every day I have been making one photo-portrait of a complete stranger. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>I walk the streets of Berlin and find fascinating characters that intrigue me and whose image I would like to keep as a memory of our shared Covid times. </p>

</div></div>","Hey there! My name is Tanya, I'm a photographer who moved to Berlin a year and a half ago. For the second lockdown in Berlin I have started to photograph one stranger in a day to escape the loneliness and to fight the fear to speak with the people on Berlin’s streets. Lockdown was supposed to last only month of November 2020, but it prolonged till the end of January and most probably would be prolonged till the end of the winter.
I’m running out of the money and can’t afford to buy the medium format Kodak film any more. The Personal project turned out to be the documentary  project which captures quite important experience in our lives. If my project ""Strangers"" speaks to you - please support it financially or by sharing the information about it. 

 
When the second lockdown started in Berlin I decided to create a photography project called “Strangers”.  
The project started as a way to escape two things: my loneliness as a single person who recently moved to a new city and the fear of speaking with people on the streets of Berlin.
 

 
Since the 2nd of November, when the second lockdown was announced, every day I have been making one photo-portrait of a complete stranger. 
 

 
I walk the streets of Berlin and find fascinating characters that intrigue me and whose image I would like to keep as a memory of our shared Covid times. 
 

 
I use an electronic construction meter to measure out exactly one and a half meter between the person and my camera. 
 

 
While I photograph someone, I talk to them and use one of their quotes under their photo to give you a glimpse of who they are. You can find all pictures with quotes on my Instagram page - @tanyapomnish.
 

 
The second lockdown was supposed to last in Berlin only till the end of November. One month-long photo-project seemed realistic money- and time-wise. 
 

 
Now when the end of the lockdown is uncertain, and it has already lasted over 2 months, I am running out of money.
 

 
I make these portraits with a medium format analog camera, so every photo requires expensive film and development.
 

 
I would love to continue working on this project and finish it on the last day of the lockdown. Without you, I won't be able to do that.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For those of you who don't know me, I am Juliet Piper. I am a portrait photographer with a penchant for landscape photography in fine art. I live in Somerset, UK with my partner and our two kids. We moved here when I was pregnant with our second daughter three years ago. </p>
<p>As a photographer I usually secure all my exhibition costs through my personal work and the funds I set aside for them specifically. However my photography took a step back to look after the girls and currently the funding pot is empty, transformed into nappies or some other child necessity. This campaign / exhibition, is me relaunching myself into the world of art after three years of zero time for myself and a new born strapped to my hip. She's still here, in case you were wondering... she's called Iris and she's wonderful! She can also walk and go to playgroups and I can actually get things done!</p>
<p>So here it is, the same old adage artists face around the world, and in all mediums, the same, just placed at different times in the production line: material costs... and boy do they cost!</p>
<p>I have signed up for a new exhibition in London to showcase my new body of work called ""Remember, Last Summer"". The other artists in this group exhibition are really talented, it was a must for me to pick this particular opportunity. However, I need to print and frame a few pieces and also have presentation cards printed along with a small catalogue of my work, possible even with some Hydros (previous series) in it.</p>
<p>The funds raised here would mean I can produce the frames and prints I need. It also means I would have professional promotional materials on display for potential clients, future clients, to take home with them.</p>
<p>It would, on a more intangible level,  give me that huge space in my mind currently filled with worry and endless plan B possibilities. I cannot tell you how much this would mean to me.</p>
<p>I don't expect something for nothing, I never have, and therefore you will find a list of perks and discounts on regular print prices and other pieces.</p>
<p>If you wish to take part and don't want anything in return, well yes, of course! please do! it all adds up in the end, there's no amount too small! </p>
<p>If the funding exceeds my goal I will secure the funds in a new funding pot for future exhibitions. And the ball will roll again.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise £3000 to cover printing costs, framing and the promotional materials. This will also cover the costs of going to London to deliver the work (van rental and fuel), going to the opening a few days later and returning to pick up the work at the end of the show (van rental and fuel). Three trips in total.</p>
<p>If the total amount is not reached I will give priority to the printing and framing and will have to rethink the promotional materials.</p>
<p>See the perks for details of what I am offering in return of specific amounts of funding. When choosing a print perk, framed or unframed and for all sizes, please note I will be in touch to know which print you want. Unless stated,  all prints are available in all formats.</p>
<p>Same applies for the collector's box. I will be contacting  you to find out which four prints you want. The top lid is determined by the perk itself.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to help me with my funding at this time, please, it's fine! I've been there myself! not always being able to fund all the people I would have liked to. </p>
<p>If you could make some noise about my campaign, pass it on to others.</p>

the first place means accepting your destiny, and then, choosing it. Anyone who
passes through a challenge, anyone who witnesses a disaster or a miracle, it’s
their responsibility to pass it on. Then, to be a Jew today is to be a witness.
The idea that any of us are able to talk in the name of all of us has never
been more real than now. However, today, any Jew talks also in the name of
those who are no longer here. Is it hard? Being a Jew is chasing the difficult
and overcome it. In relation to this, unless the witness feels identify with
it, I don’t feel any testimony is valid.”</i></p>

<p>This project was born after the very
deep and known concern of what is it going to happen once no more WWII
witnesses are alive. How are we telling the story? Would the message be the
same?  It’s forgetting an option?
Would it happen again?</p>
<p>I discovered a few years ago Eli
Wisel’s words in my grandparents library. It was then when i realized the
responsibility that I have as a Jewish human being and the power of Wisel’s
theory if we get to understand it. I discovered in his words a high level of
worry. He does not only defines what is it to be a jew, but also a willing to
listen and to talk, to give testimony. </p>
<p>Taking that in consideration I began
my task based upon his request. Make something that its now between us seen,
that because of the human cycle its going to be gone soon. I listened, felt,
and looked into their eyes, their glance. Happy, sad. They passed through war,
they suffered because of being jews, and very kindly they opened me the door to
their houses. “I can tell you my story, what happened. But I will never be able
to transmit you what I felt”, this were the first words Francisco Wichter told
me, the only Argentinean survivor from the schidlers list, the first day I met
him, May 2012. That moved me even more to do this project. We will never be
able to feel his suffering, to be in his skin. We can drink lots of coffees,
read lots of books and watch lots of movies with them. But no matter how much
we insist as jewish we would never be able to be their true reflect. </p>
<p>However, I didn’t stay with my arms
crossed. I decided to cherish hopes with them. That’s why I did their portraits
and built the diptych. On one hand the past, the vague identity, the scars, the
memories, the lost. And on the other hand, the eyes that tell, the scars in
their faces, signs that they lived, their lost looks, sad and happy smiles for
what they were able to built. Their cold hands that hug. </p>
<p>I was blessed with the opportunity
to listen to these 10 stories (more than 10 in reality). These are the ones
that are uploaded in the web today; there are more to come soon. Not only
reflects their experiences in the war but also this web is a bet to life. The
messages for the next generations it’s a bet, their sayings are lessons for all
ages. The educative proposals thought for each of these stories, related to the
different themes from the war teaches us that there’s a lot to learn and think,
but mostly it teaches us about love. The same happened with the 10 survivors.
When their today was revealed, when they got merreid, their children and their
grandchildren, their eyes shine, their mouths smile, and their souls reclaim.
The portraits also show this part: the value of life. In this case Aron
confessed: “us, the survivors, gave our people what they took from us; one
generation, two, or even three in some cases”.</p>
<p>The 10 survivors have different
survival stories. Hidden, fake identities, as Catholics, in concentration
camps, escaping from countries where the Nazis were. From the different ways
they survived, each of them had their own hope. They took care of those hopes,
they nurtured and cherished those hopes. </p><p><b><i>Nusia</i></b> survived as a Catholic and her hope

<p><i>“¿Qué es ser judío? El ser judío
significa, en primer lugar, asumir su destino, y en segundo lugar, elegirlo.
Cualquiera que atraviese una prueba, cualquiera que asista a un desastre o a un
milagro, es su deber transmitirlo. Hoy, entonces, ser judío es testimoniar. La
idea de que cada uno de nosotros está habilitado para hablar en nombre de todos
nunca ha sido más verdadera ahora. Salvo que ahora cada judío habla también en
nombre de los judíos que ya no existen. ¿e difícil? Ser judío es buscar lo
difícil y enseguida sobrepasarlo. En relación a esto debo decir que ningún
testimonio me parece válido, a menos que el testigo se identifique con él.”   </i></p>
<p><i>                                                                        Eli
Wiesel, artículo ¿Qué es ser judío?</i></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>30 tazas de café y té, 20 porciones de
torta, 60 colectivos, más de 600 fotos, 8 libros, 10 películas, 17 llamados, 25
audios, para contar <i>10 historias</i>. Las
palabras de Eli Wisel forman el argumento central de este trabajo. <b>Hablar por los que no están</b>, identificarse, dar testimonio.</p>
<p>Él trabajo se crea a partir de la premisa
fundamental sobre qué pasará cuando ya no haya testigos de lo ocurrido en la
Segunda Guerra Mundial. ¿Cómo se contará?, ¿El mensaje llegará igual?, ¿Existe
el olvido?, ¿Volverá a pasar?<b> </b></p>
<p>Las palabras de
Eli Wisel las descubrí hace algunos años en la biblioteca de mis abuelos. Allí
comprendí la gran responsabilidad que tengo como judía y sobre todas las cosas
el poder que podemos llegar a confiscar si entendemos a que se refería Wisel.
Descubrí en sus palabras un cierto grado de preocupación. No solo define lo que
es ser judío, sino que también es un pedido. Un pedido de escuchar y dar
testimonio.</p>
<p>Tomando
literalmente su discurso me aboque a esa tarea. Hacer ver algo que ahora está,
pero que por el ciclo humano ya no va a estar más. Escuche, sentí, indague en
sus ojos, en sus miradas. Alegres, tristes. Vivieron la guerra, sufrieron por
su condición de ser judíos y muy amablemente todos, me recibieron en sus
hogares. “Puedo contarte mi historia, como se sucedieron los hechos. Pero nunca
voy a lograr transmitirte lo que sentí”, estas fueron las primeras palabras que
me dijo Francisco Wichter, único sobreviviente en Argentina de la Lista de
Schindler, el primer día que lo conocí en Mayo del 2012. Eso me movió aún más a
hacer este trabajo. Nunca podremos sentir su sufrimiento, estar en su piel. Se
pueden tomar muchas tazas de café, leer muchos libros y ver muchas películas
junto a ellos. Pero pese a nuestra insistencia como judíos ser su fiel reflejo
no podremos. </p>
<p>Sin embargo no
por eso me quedé de brazos cruzados. Decidí abrigar esperanzas junto a ellos.
Por eso la decisión de los retratos y la construcción de los dípticos. Por un
lado el pasado, la identidad difusa, las marcas, los recuerdos, las pérdidas. Y
por otro lado los ojos que transmiten, las marcas en sus caras, señales de que
vivieron, sus miradas perdidas, sonrisas tristes y alegres por lo que supieron
construir. Sus manos frías pero que abrazan.</p>
<p>Si tendría la
posibilidad de hablar con Wisel debería agradecerle. Sus palabras inspiraron
este trabajo. Ese deseo interno de dejar algo, de cumplir con la religión que
me fue dada al nacer, pero sobre todo la que elegí tener. </p>
<p>Tuve la
magnífica y dichosa oportunidad, de escuchar estas 10 historias. En verdad más
de 10. Estas son las que están por el momento expuestas en la página web, en un
futuro vendrán más. No solo se transmite sus vivencias en la guerra y en la
Shoá, sino que también esta página web es una apuesta a la vida. El mensaje
para las generaciones venideras es una apuesta, sus frases son enseñanzas para
todas las edades. Las propuestas educativas pensadas para cada historia,
relacionadas con diferentes temas de la guerra nos enseñan que hay mucho por
aprender y reflexionar. Y por sobre todas las cosas, el amor. Con los 10
sobrevivientes se repitió la misma situación. Al relatar su actualidad, cuando
se casaron, los hijos y los nietos sus ojos brillan, se iluminan, sus bocas
sonríen y su alma se reivindica. Los retratos también muestran esta parte: el
valor de la vida. En este sentido Aron me confesó: “Los que hemos sobrevivido,
dimos a nuestro pueblo lo que nos robaron. Una generación, dos y hasta tres
generaciones.”</p>
<p>Los 10 tienen
historias diferentes de supervivencia. Escondidos, identidades falsas, como
católicos, en campos de concentración, huyendo a países donde no estaban los
Nazis.</p>
<p>De las distintas
formas que sobrevivieron, a su modo, cada uno tuvo sus esperanzas. Las
cuidaron, las abrigaron y las alimentaron. </p>
<b><i>Nusia </i></b>sobrevivió
como católica y abrigaba la esperanza de algún día revelar su verdadera
identidad. <b><i>Motek</i></b> pasó la guerra desde que empezó hasta que terminó en los
campos, su esperanza era salir y vivir libremente.<b><i> Francisco</i></b> abrigaba lo
poco que tenía, nadie de su familia estaba con vida, solo él y su futuro. <b><i>Aron</i></b>
se aferró únicamente a la esperanza de sobrevivir. El gran sostén de <b><i>Moisés
Borowicz</i></b> fue la identidad judía, si pasó lo que pasó por ser judío él
supo mantener eso para sobrevivir. <b><i>Gina</i></b> abrigo la esperanza del amor. <b><i>Salomón</i></b>
se sujetó a distanciarse de los conflictos y apostar por sus sueños. <b><i>Moisés
Helman</i></b> se mantuvo en pie por las esperanzas de sus padres. <b><i>Catalina
y Tomas Kertesz</i></b> abrigaron la esperanza de la fuerza que viene desde
adentro del cuerpo, esa que se saca cuando se cree que ya no hay nada por
hacer.<br/><p><br/></p>

will tell their testimony?
If the world doesn´t remember, if the world has no memory, will be at risk that it could happen again.
Support this project so a photojournalist can travel around North America
and Europe to interview more survivors to ensure the continuity and their remembrance.Time
flies.
Will movies
and books be enough? Would that be enough to encourage new generations to read and learn more about
what happened?
Six million Jews
were killed.
For your
children, grandchildren, friends & family. This work will endure in what
today seems to be the future of information with all the needs that this goal
requires. It will be specifically prepared to be suited for all audiences.
When it is ready I´ll sleep a little easier because I have interesting and productive material in my
power to show my children and grandchildren. And so will the whole world. As for you... Can you sleep easily?(Español abajo)                                                                                                                   The project
Abrigar
Esperanzas (Embracing hopes) consists
of a web site that shows the portrait of 10 survivors. From each of these 10
survivors you can enter to their different portfolios. Story of the survivor,
their book, a quote, a message, more pictures, a small memory and an educational
and didactic activity to do.  
The
web is already on internet with 10 survivors that arrived to Argentina and is
in Spanish. Now the challenge, and in this sense I will use the collection, is
to continue with survivor around the world. Because the story of this people is
different depending the country that they arrived. And if I have more survivors
I can have more languages, more information and documentation to spread this
work around the world.Web Site  http://abrigaresperanzas.wix.com/sobrevivientesStory and focus
 “What does it mean to be a jew? To be a jew in
the first place means accepting your destiny, and then, choosing it. Anyone who
passes through a challenge, anyone who witnesses a disaster or a miracle, it’s
their responsibility to pass it on. Then, to be a Jew today is to be a witness.
The idea that any of us are able to talk in the name of all of us has never
been more real than now. However, today, any Jew talks also in the name of
those who are no longer here. Is it hard? Being a Jew is chasing the difficult
and overcome it. In relation to this, unless the witness feels identify with
it, I don’t feel any testimony is valid.”

30 cups of coffee and tea, 20 pieces

“¿Qué es ser judío? El ser judío
significa, en primer lugar, asumir su destino, y en segundo lugar, elegirlo.
Cualquiera que atraviese una prueba, cualquiera que asista a un desastre o a un
milagro, es su deber transmitirlo. Hoy, entonces, ser judío es testimoniar. La
idea de que cada uno de nosotros está habilitado para hablar en nombre de todos
nunca ha sido más verdadera ahora. Salvo que ahora cada judío habla también en
nombre de los judíos que ya no existen. ¿e difícil? Ser judío es buscar lo
difícil y enseguida sobrepasarlo. En relación a esto debo decir que ningún
testimonio me parece válido, a menos que el testigo se identifique con él.”   
                                                                        Eli
Wiesel, artículo ¿Qué es ser judío?

30 tazas de café y té, 20 porciones de
torta, 60 colectivos, más de 600 fotos, 8 libros, 10 películas, 17 llamados, 25
audios, para contar 10 historias. Las
palabras de Eli Wisel forman el argumento central de este trabajo. Hablar por los que no están, identificarse, dar testimonio.
Él trabajo se crea a partir de la premisa
fundamental sobre qué pasará cuando ya no haya testigos de lo ocurrido en la
Segunda Guerra Mundial. ¿Cómo se contará?, ¿El mensaje llegará igual?, ¿Existe
el olvido?, ¿Volverá a pasar? 
Las palabras de
Eli Wisel las descubrí hace algunos años en la biblioteca de mis abuelos. Allí
comprendí la gran responsabilidad que tengo como judía y sobre todas las cosas
el poder que podemos llegar a confiscar si entendemos a que se refería Wisel.
Descubrí en sus palabras un cierto grado de preocupación. No solo define lo que
es ser judío, sino que también es un pedido. Un pedido de escuchar y dar
testimonio.
Tomando
literalmente su discurso me aboque a esa tarea. Hacer ver algo que ahora está,
pero que por el ciclo humano ya no va a estar más. Escuche, sentí, indague en
sus ojos, en sus miradas. Alegres, tristes. Vivieron la guerra, sufrieron por
su condición de ser judíos y muy amablemente todos, me recibieron en sus
hogares. “Puedo contarte mi historia, como se sucedieron los hechos. Pero nunca
voy a lograr transmitirte lo que sentí”, estas fueron las primeras palabras que
me dijo Francisco Wichter, único sobreviviente en Argentina de la Lista de
Schindler, el primer día que lo conocí en Mayo del 2012. Eso me movió aún más a
hacer este trabajo. Nunca podremos sentir su sufrimiento, estar en su piel. Se
pueden tomar muchas tazas de café, leer muchos libros y ver muchas películas
junto a ellos. Pero pese a nuestra insistencia como judíos ser su fiel reflejo
no podremos. 
Sin embargo no
por eso me quedé de brazos cruzados. Decidí abrigar esperanzas junto a ellos.
Por eso la decisión de los retratos y la construcción de los dípticos. Por un
lado el pasado, la identidad difusa, las marcas, los recuerdos, las pérdidas. Y
por otro lado los ojos que transmiten, las marcas en sus caras, señales de que
vivieron, sus miradas perdidas, sonrisas tristes y alegres por lo que supieron
construir. Sus manos frías pero que abrazan.
Si tendría la
posibilidad de hablar con Wisel debería agradecerle. Sus palabras inspiraron
este trabajo. Ese deseo interno de dejar algo, de cumplir con la religión que
me fue dada al nacer, pero sobre todo la que elegí tener. 
Tuve la
magnífica y dichosa oportunidad, de escuchar estas 10 historias. En verdad más
de 10. Estas son las que están por el momento expuestas en la página web, en un
futuro vendrán más. No solo se transmite sus vivencias en la guerra y en la
Shoá, sino que también esta página web es una apuesta a la vida. El mensaje
para las generaciones venideras es una apuesta, sus frases son enseñanzas para
todas las edades. Las propuestas educativas pensadas para cada historia,
relacionadas con diferentes temas de la guerra nos enseñan que hay mucho por
aprender y reflexionar. Y por sobre todas las cosas, el amor. Con los 10
sobrevivientes se repitió la misma situación. Al relatar su actualidad, cuando
se casaron, los hijos y los nietos sus ojos brillan, se iluminan, sus bocas
sonríen y su alma se reivindica. Los retratos también muestran esta parte: el
valor de la vida. En este sentido Aron me confesó: “Los que hemos sobrevivido,
dimos a nuestro pueblo lo que nos robaron. Una generación, dos y hasta tres
generaciones.”
Los 10 tienen
historias diferentes de supervivencia. Escondidos, identidades falsas, como
católicos, en campos de concentración, huyendo a países donde no estaban los
Nazis.
De las distintas
formas que sobrevivieron, a su modo, cada uno tuvo sus esperanzas. Las
cuidaron, las abrigaron y las alimentaron. 
Nusia sobrevivió
como católica y abrigaba la esperanza de algún día revelar su verdadera
identidad. Motek pasó la guerra desde que empezó hasta que terminó en los
campos, su esperanza era salir y vivir libremente. Francisco abrigaba lo
poco que tenía, nadie de su familia estaba con vida, solo él y su futuro. Aron
se aferró únicamente a la esperanza de sobrevivir. El gran sostén de Moisés
Borowicz fue la identidad judía, si pasó lo que pasó por ser judío él
supo mantener eso para sobrevivir. Gina abrigo la esperanza del amor. Salomón
se sujetó a distanciarse de los conflictos y apostar por sus sueños. Moisés
Helman se mantuvo en pie por las esperanzas de sus padres. Catalina
y Tomas Kertesz abrigaron la esperanza de la fuerza que viene desde
adentro del cuerpo, esa que se saca cuando se cree que ya no hay nada por
hacer.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Dino Mangano, and I am a high school teacher, as well as a freelance photographer!  One of my passions, in addition to photography, is wine, specifically Michigan wine.  Most of America know about the West Coast wineries, but very few know about the amazing wines made here on the ""North Coast"".  My dream is to create a Michigan Wineries Photo Book that is as vibrant, unique, and appealing as the wineries and vineyards it will contain.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only will this book be a wonderful collectors item, but it will help to open the eyes of American wine lovers to the special wines created here in Michigan, a State that is in dire need of positive economic growth.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This plan will not be overly expensive, but any endeavor like this is just out of my tight budget at this time.  I will need to take a 3-4 day photo excursion to the Leelaneau and Old Mission Peninsulas, during August or September.  I'll need funding to cover basic trip costs (lodging, food, gas, etc).  Once done, I'll need limited funds for editing, printing and publishing.  My goal is to do all this for $1000.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word!  This project can help not only a blossoming photographer, but also lend a helping hand to a wonderful area of a wonderful State.</p>

We took pictures, without prior aesthetic decision, welcoming all we could see in the meetings that we made.In a second step, we created, in this reception center, various spaces of workshops, over a period of three years. The first type of workshop revolved around the portrait. We photographed the people, printed the portrait directly, then we proposed to each to intervene on his image.We also proposed workshops around images representing places of life: they were able to redraw the outlines, transform them, color them. In this device, we then use a photocopier to make another type of portrait. We wanted to talk about the asylum procedure itself, its heavy administrative burden. Hence the idea of ​​subverting a bureaucracy tool. The use of this administrative tool refers to the question of waiting for a response from the state. This letter will decide the fate of these people in transit: a ""positive"" or ""negative"" to their asylum application. It was for us to create a space, a device that allows collaboration in the construction of images. We consider that every image is a construction, and not a faithful reproduction of ""reality"". Our approach is integrative, setting up workshops, joint creation actions, trying to collaborate to the maximum with those who agree to be photographed.The idea of ​​making a book appeared very quickly as a matter of course : to create an object that could contain all these productions, and that could pay tribute to those people who gave us their time.In order for this book to come into being, we needed a publisher. It is Art Paper Editions (APE) who has given us its trust, and we are very happy!Now, we need money. That is why we are asking for your participation today: you can pre-buy the book, or support the project thanks to the various counterparts! You can also help us by sharing and talking about the project around you.Funds raised will be used for printing and creating the book. If our goal were to be exceeded, the extra money would be used to create an exhibition.

</h3>
<p>  For me to finally make a more serious stab at professional photography.  I'm a 32 year old chemist looking to branch out from my lab job and pursue what I consider one of the best of my artistic talents as a career - photography.  I'm already working, but there is only so much I can do with the gear I have.  Now that I am starting to collect some impressive glass, it's time for a full frame body!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Goal. . . </h2>
<p>  A Canon 6d with 24-105mm f4 L lens.  Retails for $2899.00.  With tax, that amounts to $3138.17.  The extra is to cover fees.  The reason for going in on the kit instead of just the body is because all my zoom lenses are for APS-C bodies.  Most of my work is done with fast primes, but there are times when you just can't carry all of them along.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Should the unspeakable happen and I don't reach my goal, the funds will go towards buying the body only.  And should I not get enough even for that, then I will ask everyone I know for cash for my birthday and try to make up the difference that way.  Point being, I will make this happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Should I go over my goal, never fear that I shall spend the excess on strippers and whiskey - there are far too many accessories, lenses, flashes, tripods, etc. for me to ever collect them all.  But I would definitely start with a bag to put it in.  And should I get enough, a 5d mkIII would be a more than suitable replacement. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What this means to the world at large. . .</h2>
<p>  Well, lots of great creative common license photos for one.  Happier clients with better photos for another.  It means I don't have to be 20 feet away to take advantage of my best lenses.  It also means plenty of multiangle videos of events, fire dancing, effigy burns - all of which I tend to releaes under CC:A licenses.  More than anything, with a better camera, I get to create, document, and share better art.</p>
<p>  Also, there are some great perks for the people who contribute, like half-day shoots with prints for less money than I would typically charge for a shoot that long, or discounts for prints from my smugmug account.  Unfortunately, you need to live in Texas to take advantage of some of these, unless you're so in love with my work that you feel the need to pay for my travel (which would be amazing and flattering). </p>

<h3><em>Please know ... I am not looking for donations or charity. Your receiving your perks i.e. photographic prints, photography courses and limited release prints is very important to me. </em></h3>
<h3><em>Our retail value of the perk is more than the contribution asked/attached to the perk.</em></h3>
<h3><em>Thank you for looking at the Remember Forever story.</em></h3>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h3>The story so far ...</h3>
<p>My name is Luke Ballard. Five years ago I began Remember Forever Photography in Australia. It started with me selling photographs and prints at a market stall, grew into a portrait studio and is now about teaching photography and sharing my passion for photography with everyone I meet.</p>
<p>The video above is my voice. It is a summary of what we do in Australia and this is a trial promotional video we are currently using on our website. To me, it sums up our product philosophy, our core beliefs and our aims in the marketplace.</p>
<p>It's not a great video but it is the easiest way to show you our product.</p>
<p>The philosophy behind Remember Forever is that everyone and anyone can learn how to take amazing photographs - and in this day and age, capturing that special moment is important - hence our brand name of Remember Forever.</p>
<p>This week my wife was offered a transfer with her company to New York - forced to face one of those career choices where it is her work or her husband we've decided to try for both. </p>
<p>For the last five years I have slowly built Remember Forever up and sacrificed a lot in doing so. We don't own a home (we currently live with Nicole's parents), there are weeks that Remember Forever's staff wages have had to be paid out of Nicole's salary and savings. It has been a lot of hard work to follow my passion for sharing photography with everyone.</p>
<p>At times it has felt like a hobby project rather than a viable business.</p>
<p>It might have been simpler if I was turned on by money and was happy to sell myself to the highest bidder - but each day I feel rewarded being able to share my love of photography as my career.</p>
<p>The good news is, for the first time in five years there is light at the end of the tunnel. After a lot of work and sacrifices, Remember Forever is almost at the point of hitting the big leagues. Then out of thin air my wife is offered the transfer of a lifetime to New York. I can't ask her to turn it down - it wouldn't be fair. At the same time, the only way I can come to New York and start Remember Forever there without support from the IndieGoGo community is to pull apart everything we've worked for in Australia, lose everything we've built and start over.</p>
<p>However, I feel with the support of the IndieGoGo community it is possible we can keep Australia operating and open a Remember Forever in New York, so I can follow my wife to the United States.</p>
<p>This campaign is to finance the opening, licencing, marketing, insuring and staffing a New York studio and school for beginner to intermediate photography students. The goal is to do so in such a way that the Australian Remember Forever has a chance of continuing operation under a new Manager.</p>
<p>The physical benefits to me of the campaign are the continued operation of my business in Australia and the expansion of my business to the greatest city in the world and the emotional benefits are that I can join my wife in the U.S. while she pursues her career.</p>
<p>I have loved photography for over 20 years and am devoted to sharing that love and passion for photography with everyone who attends one of our classes in Australia. If you look at our website or our Facebook page you will see the hundreds of customer testimonials and student feedback from attending and participating in our courses.</p>
<p>I am devoted to bringing this same quality of photographic education and service to New York. Our systems and educational modules have been refined over several years and every customer we've had loves us. We are also amongst the most affordable with classes and courses costing on average less than $100. We've focused more on sharing our love of photography than charging an arm or a leg to do so.</p>
<p>If you look at our website: <a href=""http://www.rememberforever.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rememberforever.com.au</a> you will see who we are, what we do and how we do it.  If you visit our Facebook page: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/rememberforeverphotography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/rememberforeverphotography</a> you will see the people who we've taught, the customers whose moments we've photographed and the feedback from everyone we encounter.</p>
<p>If you met my wife, you'd understand why I'm not letting her go to New York without me :)</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Where It Goes:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>There is no limit on where we could use funds in opening a New York school - the more we could raise then the larger our studio space (and better neighborhood) it could be in. </p>
<p>Our core goal is $40,000 which will allow us to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finance relocation and L2 visa expenses for myself (Nicole's are paid for by her company).</li>
<li>Lease small office &amp; studio space</li>
<li>Obtain licencing and permits required by City and State of New York and the Department of Labour</li>
<li>Market and advertise Remember Forever in the New York area</li>
<li>Purchase and obtain equipment (computers, cameras &amp; lighting)</li>
<li>Hire two student/graduating photographers in New York to train in Remember Forever style, systems and educational modules</li>
<li>Insurance costs of the business &amp; medical insurance for staff</li>
<li>Make a difference to beginning photographers in New York</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't hit $40,000 then we use whatever funding we do receive prioritizing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Relocation and Visa costs       ($  8,500 total)</li>
<li>Licences, Permits, Insurance   ($  6,000 total)</li>
<li>Equipment Purchase              ($  8,000 total)</li>
<li>Marketing                           (Bottomless Pit)</li>
</ol>
<p>This would leave office and studio space as well as staff hiring a lower priority financially. </p>
<p>No matter what I am following my wife, delivering the perks and opening this school (even if it is outdoors in the middle of Winter). I am equally as passionate about my wife as I am photography and I mean to have them both.</p>
<p>If we were to exceed our target then the studio/class space could be bigger and better. We could hire more staff and run outreach programs teaching underprivileged kids about photography - and perhaps lead them to the career that has made me so happy.</p>
<p>By hiring more staff we would be able to run classes more frequently. Remember Forever Australia currently offer 15 standard workshops and courses, a variety of Masterclasses and also extended programs for high school students and adult photographers alike. </p>
<p>New York will start with five different courses initially and expand outwards from there based on the number of staff we could hire.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What this could mean ...</h3>
<p>This campaign isn't about asking people to finance me doing what I love doing. It isn't about giving a successful business more money to grow.</p>
<p>We are successful in that we survived the global economic crisis. We aren't yet successful in terms of profit and size, though we hope one day to be. For us, our size is measured in potential.</p>
<p>This campaign is about financing two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sharing a love of photography with every New Yorker who owns a camera</li>
<li>Allowing my wife and I to live on the same continent and both do what we love</li>
</ol>
<p>The visa the Immigration Attorneys are having me enter on is an L2 visa.</p>
<p>Rather than coming to the States on the visa and taking a job that pays a lot of money, could go to someone else and I might not appreciate, I'd rather create an industry. I'm not wanting to take someones job - I want to share my love of photography and hire New Yorkers who share that love.</p>
<p>I could make a lot of money as a fashion or travel photographer (and used to) but over the last five years have grown to love what Remember Forever stands for - that anyone can learn how to use their camera and take amazing photographs.</p>
<p>One of the biggest complements I have ever received from a class I've run was ""I learned more in three hours with Luke than I did in six weeks full time at an Arts College studying Photography.""</p>
<p>I also love being near my wife and spending time traveling away from her on assignment is difficult - we haven't even been married two years yet. Her contract in New York is for longer than we've been married :(</p>
<p>As I said at the beginning, I began Remember Forever with nothing but my camera. I started selling photographic prints at market stalls on weekends and visiting customers homes to photograph them of an evening every day during the week. Eventually I earned enough for my studio in Brisbane. I ran our first workshop ""People, Children and Your Family"" as a birthday party for a friend - it is now amongst our most popular courses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately through the Global Economic Crisis and the rising costs of overheads, the studio had to close down and we almost lost the business. We carried on though with the belief that one day it would work, that somehow everything would come together.</p>
<p>Over five years I have built Remember Forever to be a trusted and respected brand in Australia. We are growing every week and one day soon Australia's Remember Forever team will be profitable rather than scraping by every week.</p>
<p>I know that coming to New York to start again in a new and more expensive marketplace is risky. Some may call it stupid. :)</p>
<p>I am excited about the challenge of starting again in New York but realistic at the same time. When I started in Australia, it was my own country and we had a support network of friends and family. I know opening New York is going to be harder but I am determined to succeed. </p>
<p>Funding means that I can start with what we're great at - the courses and classes and hire good local people to help build the brand locally.</p>
<p>It means that in December we can start setting up and fulfilling our perks. In January we can open with photography classes in New York City. It means we are hiring New Yorkers and training them to grow and run a photography business. It means my wife and I are on the same continent.</p>
<p>The perks for helping are beautiful photos captured with my first love of New York in full bloom. Perks also include some of our classes and tours pre-purchased and then we have also included some luxury items - limited editions and one offs.</p>
<p>I have outlined these over in the Perks section. More importantly, you'll be a part of the Remember Forever community. Our survival so far in Australia is due to our customers. A group that with us have become so passionate about photography that life for them is now about capturing those special moments.</p>
<p>The opportunity that New York has over Australia is you won't just be capturing moments, you now have an opportunity to help create them.</p>
<p>I will be exploring New York on my arrival and taking the first series of photographs that will be used in our courses and classes - these will become limited edition prints for perks also.</p>
<p>All perks (whether vouchers, prints or books) will be delivered in time for Christmas.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand not everyone can assist with funding. In fact, if everyone could help with funding I would strongly suspect the community of money laundering.</p>
<p>If you look at this and think that it's not for you to fund, that this isn't an exciting prospect for you then don't feel bad. I do understand.</p>
<p>I would ask you to please consider that it may be for someone else and share it with your social networks. Tweet it, Facebook it, Share it, Post it. If you know someone and they own a camera or have any precious moments in their life, then we're a company that may be something they are interested in.<br/><br/>If you know someone who loves photography, heck, even someone who owns a camera in the New York area then point them this way.</p>
<p>If you are close personal friends with Donald Trump (or even Don Jr.) then please let them know about us - point them this way :)</p>

<p>(Ilona)</p>
<p>Ilona is a 23 year-old student from Slovenia. She travelled from her small hometown of Kamnik to a far away city of Rotterdam in Netherlands. All for following her dream of becoming a professional photographer. </p>
<p>It was hard in the beginning, being far away from her family and friends, far away from the beautiful nature of Slovenia, in a country that speaks a language that she couldn't understand. But I guess every beginning is hard. </p>
<p>She successfully finished the 1st year at the Academy of Willem de Kooning.  Studying made Ilona super happy as she noticed that her skills and understanding of Photography were improving a lot trough the year. It gave her so much motivation and during her summer vacation Ilona was working very hard, without any free days, saving up all the money to buy herself a new, better camera.</p>

<p>After going back to school she decided to sell her old camera together with all the equipment  that she had and combined with her savings it would be just enough to buy a better one. She posted an add on a online page and soon she got a call from a stranger, saying that he want's to buy all the  equipment. The stranger came to visit Ilona at her apartment and asked her all about the camera, equipment and even for advice on how to take better pictures. After some tea and all these questions the stranger made her the transfer (of 1500€) to her account via mobile phone.

<p>So this very much uncompassionate act left young Ilona studying photography in Netherlands without a camera and without the resources to buy a new one.</p>
<p>After hearing her story we were all very angry but mostly just sad, not being able to comprehend the fact how anyone would do such a thing to a young student, without a job, at the beginning of her path.</p>
<p>As we really wanted to help her, but not being able to give her any money, we were all trying to find another way. The idea that came to mind was; why not invest our time and skills into a project that would help us raise some money from kind-hearted people all over the world.</p>
<p>And project Ilona was born :)</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our basic goal is 1500 € (1700$), which was the amount Ilona was supposed to get by selling her equipment. This is the minimum amount she would need to buy a camera, that would be more appropriate for her skill level, than the one she had before.</p>
<p>Of course any amount is still very helpful, so no matter how much we raise, it all goes into the camera fund! :) </p>
<p>Because we are really thankful for any support that we get, everyone who donates can choose to receive a unique, handmade gift which we will pack and send to you by post.</p>
<p><strong>How it works;</strong></p>
<p>We created a few products into which we put a lot of time and love. When you donate a certain amount you can choose to receive a small gift as a token of our gratitude. All these gifts are handmade in Slovenia.</p>
<p>If you donate:</p>
<p>*Any amount, you get:  1x certificate for being an awesome person (.PDF)</p>
<p>*12$, you get:   1x handmade wooden camera key chain</p>
<p>*22$, you get:   1x hand printed T-shirt</p>
<p>*45$ you get:   1x handmade wooden camera SD card holder                                     </p>
<p>Of course you can choose to donate without taking the gifts. :)</p>
<p>This project is running until 15th of December. After the project finishes, we will pack and send you the goods to the address that you give us. As we know December is the time of celebration and gifts for our loved ones, we will try and send the goods as soon as possible. Usually the post takes less than a week to deliver, so the expected delivery would be before Christmas. But of course sometimes there are some delays so please be patient! </p>

</div></div>","This is a story about Ilona

(Ilona)
Ilona is a 23 year-old student from Slovenia. She travelled from her small hometown of Kamnik to a far away city of Rotterdam in Netherlands. All for following her dream of becoming a professional photographer. 
It was hard in the beginning, being far away from her family and friends, far away from the beautiful nature of Slovenia, in a country that speaks a language that she couldn't understand. But I guess every beginning is hard. 
She successfully finished the 1st year at the Academy of Willem de Kooning.  Studying made Ilona super happy as she noticed that her skills and understanding of Photography were improving a lot trough the year. It gave her so much motivation and during her summer vacation Ilona was working very hard, without any free days, saving up all the money to buy herself a new, better camera.

(Ilona's photo - You can check more of her work here:  https://www.facebook.com/eyeloneah/ , https://eyeloneah.com/ )
After going back to school she decided to sell her old camera together with all the equipment  that she had and combined with her savings it would be just enough to buy a better one. She posted an add on a online page and soon she got a call from a stranger, saying that he want's to buy all the  equipment. The stranger came to visit Ilona at her apartment and asked her all about the camera, equipment and even for advice on how to take better pictures. After some tea and all these questions the stranger made her the transfer (of 1500€) to her account via mobile phone. Ilona, being a little bit naive, but mostly just trustful gave him all the  equipment and he left. But she never got the money on her account...

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Spencer Zachary, a videographer/photographer and a student at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. Last semester, I had the chance to go study abroad in the wonderful nation of New Zealand at the University of Otago in Dunedin. While I was there, I immersed myself in some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world. This book is an encapsulation of my time there and my best photos I took there. It consists of over 70 images, both film and digital, and a few stories from my time there.</p>
<h3>Why Am I Making This Book?</h3>
<p>I've found profound enjoyment over the past few years in actually printing my photos instead of them sitting on a hard drive or on social media. Going to such an amazing place, I knew I wanted to do something different and challenge myself to make something new. The idea of a ""zine"" or an actual book came to me before I left and the idea stuck with me throughout my time there. This process has taught me about design/layout and also allowed me to collaborate with some of my very talented, creative friends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to sell at least 20 books. That would allow me to provide the cheapest prices for customers from the printing service I'm using.</p>
<p>By preordering, you will receive a hardcover 8"" x 10"" copy of the book! I will be ordering these from the printer and shipping them myself. My goal is to get these shipped before the holiday season of 2019. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A portion of the profits from this project will be donated to the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-profit environmental advocacy group that focuses on issues such as climate change, clean energy, ecosystem restoration and pollution. I got to experience these magnificent places, our grandchildren should be able to see them too.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Thank You!</h3>
<p>Thank you so much! I am beyond grateful and hope you enjoy the project. I have loved every step of the way and can't wait to share this book with others.</p>

<p>I've been a photographer ever since I was old enough to hold a camera, but I've only been in business since 2009. It started when my dad handed me his SLR film camera, a Minolta XD-7, one of the first of it's kind. I began to take photos of <i>everything.</i> Even my friends were susceptible to my paparazzi tendencies!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/889939/files/20140929081142-Lana_shocked_2030354425.jpg?1412003502"" src="""" style=""width: 471.483076923077px; height: 314px;""/></p>
<br/><p>I loved it. I carried that camera with me everywhere and it became a passion of mine. When I moved to New Mexico in 2006, I bought my first digital camera. This opened a whole new world of possibilities and this only fueled my passion.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/889952/files/20140929081625-Susie_and_Punky_3969170133.jpg?1412003785"" src="""" style=""width: 595.980629539952px; height: 397px;""/></p>
<br/><p>I then started Brandow Photography and learned very quickly how competitive this business really is! I have a passion to bring people happiness by capturing their best moments and to show others the beautiful world all around them.</p>
<p></p>

<p>This campaign is to expand my business from being a ""just another photographer"" business, to ""Photographer Extraordinaire!"" Business. I have a vision to bring people my high definition art into their homes. Whether the art be of their own family members or a place far away they've never been to. I want to sell my photography as high quality canvas prints and aluminum prints of custom sizes. </p>
<p>I also want to teach others what I know and to give back to the community. I plan on teaching others the art of photography basics. I will also hold advanced classes for a nominal fee.</p>
<p>By helping me today, you will help me realize my dream and you'll get a piece of that as well, as I'll explain further down.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This campaign is to raise $25,000 to help me to rent a small studio space and purchase the equipment needed to create even better art and help me to make this a full time career!</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I will need to print more of my photography to showcase within said studio. Printing those items from my contact in a professional lab will cost a few thousand alone, with a mix of paper print, stretch canvas prints and aluminum prints. Update: For all prints on different mediums, it will cost approximately $4,800.</span><br/>

<i>But what do I get? </i> I'm glad you asked! As you'll see in the Perks section, depending on how much you contribute to my campaign, you will get high quality prints in varying sizes and materials. The higher the contribution, the larger and better material art you will receive. And what's better? Completely free shipping on all Perk items. AND you get to PICK the art from my gallery. </div>

<div>Now, I understand that not all campaigns are successful and reach their goal amount. If that is the case with this campaign, that would be unfortunate, but I would still use the money towards expanding my business and you will still get your perks!</div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span></div>
</div><div> <p>My main goal is to give back to the community. My gallery and studio will also hold free basic photography classes, with premium advanced classes that can also be accessed online. I want to create an open environment that people will feel welcome to, and not just another photographer's studio that they may feel obligated to purchase items or services. </p>
<p>Also, successfully funding this campaign would have a major impact on my and my family's lives. To be completely honest, due to the economy we are living paycheck to paycheck at the moment, and expanding this business will help us to get out of that loop. It will ensure that we can do fun things again, like taking our son to the zoo more often or taking mini vacations. Ensuring that we can send him to nice schools down the road. Allowing us to consider having a second child, as we refuse to live off of government assistance. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello everyone! As you saw in the video, my name is Shawn Brandow, owner of Brandow Photography. 
I've been a photographer ever since I was old enough to hold a camera, but I've only been in business since 2009. It started when my dad handed me his SLR film camera, a Minolta XD-7, one of the first of it's kind. I began to take photos of everything. Even my friends were susceptible to my paparazzi tendencies!


I loved it. I carried that camera with me everywhere and it became a passion of mine. When I moved to New Mexico in 2006, I bought my first digital camera. This opened a whole new world of possibilities and this only fueled my passion.


I then started Brandow Photography and learned very quickly how competitive this business really is! I have a passion to bring people happiness by capturing their best moments and to show others the beautiful world all around them.


This campaign is to expand my business from being a ""just another photographer"" business, to ""Photographer Extraordinaire!"" Business. I have a vision to bring people my high definition art into their homes. Whether the art be of their own family members or a place far away they've never been to. I want to sell my photography as high quality canvas prints and aluminum prints of custom sizes. 
I also want to teach others what I know and to give back to the community. I plan on teaching others the art of photography basics. I will also hold advanced classes for a nominal fee.
By helping me today, you will help me realize my dream and you'll get a piece of that as well, as I'll explain further down.
   What I Need & What You Get This campaign is to raise $25,000 to help me to rent a small studio space and purchase the equipment needed to create even better art and help me to make this a full time career!



The average small studio/office space here in Albuquerque runs at about $400-$700 per month. The funding will help to get my doors open and people inside, which will in turn produce more revenue within a couple of months.


I will need to print more of my photography to showcase within said studio. Printing those items from my contact in a professional lab will cost a few thousand alone, with a mix of paper print, stretch canvas prints and aluminum prints. Update: For all prints on different mediums, it will cost approximately $4,800.

Better Photography equipment is needed to add to my currently outdated equipment, to bring even higher quality photography to my clients: 



Canon 5D Mark III camera with 24-70mm f/4L lens from B&H ($4,149.00)
Battery Grip for camera ($295.95)
2 Battery Packs ($120)
Canon - EF 200mm f/2.8L II USM Lens ($779)

Canon - EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM Lens ($2299)

Canon - Speedlite 600EX-RT (x3)($1500)

Once I can open the studio itself (on or around January 2015), I will need several lighting setups, so here is a rudimentary list:


Various backdrops and stands ($2000)
Einstein™ E640 Flash Unit (x2)($1000)
Light Stands and booms ($3000)
Furniture and other office items ($1000)

And last but not least, advertising to promote my business within my community, which will cost several more thousand. Advertising is key, and I'll need enough of that to build a larger clientele base so they may eventually do the advertising for me by word of mouth. I'm looking into a radio spot, local and online advertising costs, including banners at local businesses -- such as at the mall, etc.



But what do I get?  I'm glad you asked! As you'll see in the Perks section, depending on how much you contribute to my campaign, you will get high quality prints in varying sizes and materials. The higher the contribution, the larger and better material art you will receive. And what's better? Completely free shipping on all Perk items. AND you get to PICK the art from my gallery. 

Now, I understand that not all campaigns are successful and reach their goal amount. If that is the case with this campaign, that would be unfortunate, but I would still use the money towards expanding my business and you will still get your perks!
The Impact
 My main goal is to give back to the community. My gallery and studio will also hold free basic photography classes, with premium advanced classes that can also be accessed online. I want to create an open environment that people will feel welcome to, and not just another photographer's studio that they may feel obligated to purchase items or services. 
Also, successfully funding this campaign would have a major impact on my and my family's lives. To be completely honest, due to the economy we are living paycheck to paycheck at the moment, and expanding this business will help us to get out of that loop. It will ensure that we can do fun things again, like taking our son to the zoo more often or taking mini vacations. Ensuring that we can send him to nice schools down the road. Allowing us to consider having a second child, as we refuse to live off of government assistance. 


By funding this campaign, you not only help enrich our lives, but yours and those around you as well. By receiving one of the great perks to hang on your wall, you expand the vision of everyone that looks at it. The art that is photography can boost morale and entice a sense of wanderlust and happiness. That is what you get, a sense of accomplishment, and that is the greatest feeling of all.


As contributions come in, I will continue to post updates here, showing the progress I am making, thanks to you!

Risks & Challenges One of the largest challenges I face is reception from the rest of my family, who do not believe photography is a smart business move. Not only do I wish to improve the life of my wife and son, but to prove them wrong! I will be successful.

I was surprised to hear come up often in conversations with Athenians the idea that green spaces are lacking in the city. I had just moved there from Paris and this was not at all my impression. I saw Athens as a very rich city in terms of botanical life. It seemed as though plants were shooting out of every crack in the pavement. So I decided to confront these two feelings and explore the city’s green spaces. It was quickly clear that there are in fact not that many parks, as in organized green spaces. But that organic life was very present everywhere, from balconies to the streets and, of course, the hills or “Lofos”. </p><p>As soon as I started exploring them I couldn’t stop, I felt fascinated by these spaces that are unlike any I had met before. The hills create a sense of wonder, as you explore them, the city fades away, only to appear through small windows in the trees. </p><p>The book of Lofos Athens is a walk in these hills, an exploration of these utopic territories. Moving from a poetic aw to a look at the political and  social importance of their existence in the heart of Athens. </p><p>The book is made of images taken between 2018 and 2021 and texts contributed by Marc Delalonde and Ioanna Gerakidi. The design will be overseen by Matto studio.</p><p>It is expected to come out in September of 2021</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why a book :</strong></p><p>The idea of making the series into a book came quite naturally. It is a series of images that tell a strong story when put together, they create a narrative. The layout is meant to create a sequence of exploration, recreating the feeling of walking through the hills, stopping to admire a view, or details found along the way. This allows for an understanding of the geography and topology of the city. </p><p>Making a book is also a way to look at multiple relationships between Athenians and the hills. The artists and designers involved in the project have a connection to the city and have explored the hills. These spaces are such strong and poetic territories, the relations with them is often quite intimate and by using a publication form I wish to recreate this feeling.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The contributors :</strong></p><p><u><i>Nicolas Melemis</i></u><i> </i>is a Paris and Athens based photographer and artist. With a background in architecture, he works on sociability and relations between people in urban settings. He is one of the founding members of the creative Studio Acide and a regular collaborator to the design studio Diplomates.</p><p> </p><p><u><i>Matto studio</i></u><i> </i>is  a creative studio and creator of Matto magazine. The studio, composed of Dominika Hadelova and Aldo Buscalferri is based in Paris. The magazine explores contemporary art and the creative process through curious conversations and studio visits.</p><p> </p><p><i><u>Ioanna Gerakidi</u></i> : is a writer, curator and educator based in Athens and Amsterdam. She has collaborated with and curated group shows/events for or within the context of Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam), State of Concept (Athens), Amsterdam Art, Athens Biennale, Athens Digital Arts Festival, Hot Wheels Projects (Athens), Haus N (Athens) and more. Her texts have been presented at Kunstverein Amsterdam, Stroom (Den Hague), Künstlerhaus Stuttgart, CAC Vilnius, Carlos/Ishikawa (London), and NiMAC (Nicosia), among others. She has contributed in several publications and she has lectured or led workshops for Design Academy Eindhoven, Gerrit Rietveld Academie, Athens School of Fine Arts, Document &amp; Contemporary Art PhD program, Onassis Air Residency, AKV St. Joost Den Bosch and Noiserr. Some of her past residencies include Rupert Residency, Syros Sound Meetings and NEON Curatorial Exchange Program. Projects of hers have been funded by Mondriaan Fonds, Outset Funds and Rupert Residency.</p><p> </p><p><i><u>Marc Delalonde</u></i> is a French curator, independent researcher and cultural practitioner currently based in Greece, where he lives in-between Mount Lycabettus and Strefi Hill. He works at the intersection of arts, community-building, environmental philosophy and political ecology. His practice stems from the intersection of concepts such as symbiosis, natureculture and the more-than-human.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The funding :</strong></p><p>I already financed by myself a part of the book production + the expenses for the pictures, but we need your help to finance the last part of the production of the book. The money raised here will go to paying an honest wage to all the actors of the project : writers, designers, the translator and photographer. It will also go towards the production costs of printing and distribution. We worked towards making the object we wanted and making it the most affordable possible. The small amount of books made and the self published nature of the project make it difficult to minimise the costs.</p><p>If the amount raised is higher than the aimed amount, the extra money will go towards funding the next photo project (a study of the Eleonas area of Athens)</p><p><strong>The object :</strong></p><p>20x25cm, 130 pages, 65 images, 500 copies</p><p>Offset and risography printing</p><p>The book will be printed in Athens in the summer of 2021</p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks :</strong></p><p>There is very little risk of the project not happening. We have secured the funds, the crowdfunding is mostly a presale campaign to be able to front the cost of production. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Other ways to help :</strong></p><p>This is a self published book and as such it is very personal and important to us. It is also a very big workload landing on a small number of people. Your support helps us financially, of course, in achieving our goal but it is also appreciated and is an essential boost in energy towards making this project happen !</p><p>If you cannot help us financially with this project please share this page on social media and through indiegogo’s website. </p><p> </p><p><u>Thank you for your support to this campaign.</u></p><p> </p><p><strong>Présentation :</strong></p><p><i>Lofos Athens</i> est un projet personnel initié lors de mon premier long séjour à Athènes, en 2018. J’ai été surpris d'entendre les athéniens se plaindre du manque de parc dans la capitale grecque. Arrivant moi-même de Paris, je ne partageais pas cette impression, en effet, la ville m’avait donné la sensation d’une présence botanique particulièrement forte. Les plantes semblaient sortir de chaque fissure de la chaussée. J’ai alors décidé de confronter les deux ressentis. Rapidement je me suis rendu compte qu’il y avait en effet peu de lieux ayant la fonction d’espaces verts. La vie organique était cependant omniprésente, dans la rue, sur les balcons et évidemment les collines ou “Lofos”.</p><p>Dès que j’ai commencé à m'intéresser aux collines, je n’ai pas pu m'arrêter. J’étais fasciné par ces espaces d’un genre que je n’avais encore jamais rencontré. Les collines créent un sentiment d’émerveillement et un échappatoire au milieu d’une mégalopole de 4 millions d’habitants. Lorsqu'on s’y enfonce, la ville s’efface pour n'apparaître que par les ouvertures dans le feuillage.</p><p>Le livre Lofos Athens est imaginé comme une balade dans ce territoire utopique. Il oscille entre un regard poétique sur l’espace et une analyse de leur importance politique et sociale au cœur d’Athènes.</p><p>Le livre se compose d’images réalisées entre 2018 et 2021, et de textes écrits par Marc Delalonde et Ioanna Gerakidi. Le design est supervisé par Matto Studio. </p><p>Le livre est attendu pour septembre 2021.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Collaborateurs : </strong></p><p><u><i>Nicolas Melemis</i></u> est un photographe franco-canadien né à Paris en 1994.

J’aimerais créer par la mise en page, la sensation d’explorer, de se balader à travers les collines : s’arrêter pour admirer la vue, se pencher sur un détail...</p><p>Les rapports entre les athéniens et les collines sont souvent intimes et personnels. La forme du livre doit permettre de recréer cette intimité.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Le financement :</strong></p><p>J’ai moi même avancé une part importante des frais de réalisation du projet et de production des images, mais nous avons besoin de votre aide pour la fin des frais de production.

I was surprised to hear come up often in conversations with Athenians the idea that green spaces are lacking in the city. I had just moved there from Paris and this was not at all my impression. I saw Athens as a very rich city in terms of botanical life. It seemed as though plants were shooting out of every crack in the pavement. So I decided to confront these two feelings and explore the city’s green spaces. It was quickly clear that there are in fact not that many parks, as in organized green spaces. But that organic life was very present everywhere, from balconies to the streets and, of course, the hills or “Lofos”. As soon as I started exploring them I couldn’t stop, I felt fascinated by these spaces that are unlike any I had met before. The hills create a sense of wonder, as you explore them, the city fades away, only to appear through small windows in the trees. The book of Lofos Athens is a walk in these hills, an exploration of these utopic territories. Moving from a poetic aw to a look at the political and  social importance of their existence in the heart of Athens. The book is made of images taken between 2018 and 2021 and texts contributed by Marc Delalonde and Ioanna Gerakidi. The design will be overseen by Matto studio.It is expected to come out in September of 2021 Why a book :The idea of making the series into a book came quite naturally. It is a series of images that tell a strong story when put together, they create a narrative. The layout is meant to create a sequence of exploration, recreating the feeling of walking through the hills, stopping to admire a view, or details found along the way. This allows for an understanding of the geography and topology of the city. Making a book is also a way to look at multiple relationships between Athenians and the hills. The artists and designers involved in the project have a connection to the city and have explored the hills. These spaces are such strong and poetic territories, the relations with them is often quite intimate and by using a publication form I wish to recreate this feeling. The contributors :Nicolas Melemis is a Paris and Athens based photographer and artist. With a background in architecture, he works on sociability and relations between people in urban settings. He is one of the founding members of the creative Studio Acide and a regular collaborator to the design studio Diplomates. Matto studio is  a creative studio and creator of Matto magazine. The studio, composed of Dominika Hadelova and Aldo Buscalferri is based in Paris. The magazine explores contemporary art and the creative process through curious conversations and studio visits. Ioanna Gerakidi : is a writer, curator and educator based in Athens and Amsterdam. She has collaborated with and curated group shows/events for or within the context of Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam), State of Concept (Athens), Amsterdam Art, Athens Biennale, Athens Digital Arts Festival, Hot Wheels Projects (Athens), Haus N (Athens) and more. Her texts have been presented at Kunstverein Amsterdam, Stroom (Den Hague), Künstlerhaus Stuttgart, CAC Vilnius, Carlos/Ishikawa (London), and NiMAC (Nicosia), among others. She has contributed in several publications and she has lectured or led workshops for Design Academy Eindhoven, Gerrit Rietveld Academie, Athens School of Fine Arts, Document & Contemporary Art PhD program, Onassis Air Residency, AKV St. Joost Den Bosch and Noiserr. Some of her past residencies include Rupert Residency, Syros Sound Meetings and NEON Curatorial Exchange Program. Projects of hers have been funded by Mondriaan Fonds, Outset Funds and Rupert Residency. Marc Delalonde is a French curator, independent researcher and cultural practitioner currently based in Greece, where he lives in-between Mount Lycabettus and Strefi Hill. He works at the intersection of arts, community-building, environmental philosophy and political ecology. His practice stems from the intersection of concepts such as symbiosis, natureculture and the more-than-human. The funding :I already financed by myself a part of the book production + the expenses for the pictures, but we need your help to finance the last part of the production of the book. The money raised here will go to paying an honest wage to all the actors of the project : writers, designers, the translator and photographer. It will also go towards the production costs of printing and distribution. We worked towards making the object we wanted and making it the most affordable possible. The small amount of books made and the self published nature of the project make it difficult to minimise the costs.If the amount raised is higher than the aimed amount, the extra money will go towards funding the next photo project (a study of the Eleonas area of Athens)The object :20x25cm, 130 pages, 65 images, 500 copiesOffset and risography printingThe book will be printed in Athens in the summer of 2021 Risks :There is very little risk of the project not happening. We have secured the funds, the crowdfunding is mostly a presale campaign to be able to front the cost of production.  Other ways to help :This is a self published book and as such it is very personal and important to us. It is also a very big workload landing on a small number of people. Your support helps us financially, of course, in achieving our goal but it is also appreciated and is an essential boost in energy towards making this project happen !If you cannot help us financially with this project please share this page on social media and through indiegogo’s website.  Thank you for your support to this campaign. Présentation :Lofos Athens est un projet personnel initié lors de mon premier long séjour à Athènes, en 2018. J’ai été surpris d'entendre les athéniens se plaindre du manque de parc dans la capitale grecque. Arrivant moi-même de Paris, je ne partageais pas cette impression, en effet, la ville m’avait donné la sensation d’une présence botanique particulièrement forte. Les plantes semblaient sortir de chaque fissure de la chaussée. J’ai alors décidé de confronter les deux ressentis. Rapidement je me suis rendu compte qu’il y avait en effet peu de lieux ayant la fonction d’espaces verts. La vie organique était cependant omniprésente, dans la rue, sur les balcons et évidemment les collines ou “Lofos”.Dès que j’ai commencé à m'intéresser aux collines, je n’ai pas pu m'arrêter. J’étais fasciné par ces espaces d’un genre que je n’avais encore jamais rencontré. Les collines créent un sentiment d’émerveillement et un échappatoire au milieu d’une mégalopole de 4 millions d’habitants. Lorsqu'on s’y enfonce, la ville s’efface pour n'apparaître que par les ouvertures dans le feuillage.Le livre Lofos Athens est imaginé comme une balade dans ce territoire utopique. Il oscille entre un regard poétique sur l’espace et une analyse de leur importance politique et sociale au cœur d’Athènes.Le livre se compose d’images réalisées entre 2018 et 2021, et de textes écrits par Marc Delalonde et Ioanna Gerakidi. Le design est supervisé par Matto Studio. Le livre est attendu pour septembre 2021. Collaborateurs : Nicolas Melemis est un photographe franco-canadien né à Paris en 1994. Aprèsdes études à l’école d’architecture de La Villette, il intègre l’ENS Louis Lumière dont il sort diplômé en 2018. Il garde de ses années d’architecture un goût pour la fabrique du tissu urbain. Son travail porte sur le rapport entre les personnes et leurs environnements ainsi que le rôle du vernaculaire dans la construction urbaine. Il est un des cofondateur du studio de création Acide et un collaborateur régulier de l'atelier Diplomates. Matto studio est un studio de création et un magazine indépendant créé en 2018 par Dominika Hadelova et Aldo Buscalferri à Paris. Le magazine explore l'art contemporain et le processus de création à travers de véritables conversations curieuses et des visites de studio. Ioanna Gerakidi  est une écrivaine, commissaire et professeur basé entre Amsterdam et Athènes. Elle a notement collaboré avec et assuré le commissariat d'exposition pour notament les Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam), State of Concept (Athens), Amsterdam Art, Athens Biennale, Athens Digital Arts Festival, Hot Wheels Projects (Athens), Haus N (Athens). Ses textes ont été présentés aux Kunstverein Amsterdam, Stroom (Den Hague), Künstlerhaus Stuttgart, CAC Vilnius, Carlos/Ishikawa (London), et NiMAC (Nicosia)... Elle a contribué à plusieurs publication et menée des workshop pour les Design Academy Eindhoven, Gerrit Rietveld Academie, Athens School of Fine Arts, Document & Contemporary Art PhD program, Onassis Air Residency, AKV St. Joost Den Bosch and Noiserr. Elle fut résidente des Rupert Residency, Syros Sound Meetings and NEON Curatorial Exchange Program. Ses projets ont été financé par, Mondriaan Fonds, Outset Funds and Rupert Residency. Marc Delalonde est un commissaire, chercheur indépendant et practicien culturel basé à Athènes où il habite entre le mont Lycabette et la colline de Streffi. Son travail se place à l'intersection de l'art, du ""community building"", de la philosophy environementale et de l'écologie politique. Sa pratique se déploie à partir de concepts comme la symbiose, natureculture et le ""plus que humain"". Pourquoi un livre ? La qualité narrative des images a fait que le format du livre s'est naturellement imposé. J’aimerais créer par la mise en page, la sensation d’explorer, de se balader à travers les collines : s’arrêter pour admirer la vue, se pencher sur un détail...Les rapports entre les athéniens et les collines sont souvent intimes et personnels. La forme du livre doit permettre de recréer cette intimité. Le financement :J’ai moi même avancé une part importante des frais de réalisation du projet et de production des images, mais nous avons besoin de votre aide pour la fin des frais de production. L’argent récolté ici servira à rémunérer correctement tous les acteurs du projet : écrivains, photographes, traducteurs et designers. Il servira également à payer l’impression et la distribution du livre. Nous avons travaillé à démocratiser l’objet final en limitant le prix, mais le projet étant auto produit ce n’est possible que dans une certaine mesure. Si toutefois nous réussissons à avoir plus de fonds que prévu initialement, ceux-ci iront vers le financement d’un prochain projet (un travail sur le quartier d’Eleonas à Athènes)L'objet :20x25cm, 130 pages, 65 images, 500 copiesImpressions en offset et risographieLe livre sera imprimé à Athènes durant l'été de 2021Risques :Une grande parties des frais de production du livre ont été avancer et il y a peu de chance que le projet ne voit pas le jour. Comment nous aider :Le projet étant auto-édité, c’est une entreprise très personnelle et qui nous tient à cœur. C’est également une grande quantité de travail qui incombe à une petite équipe. Votre soutien financier nous aide évidemment à faire naître le livre mais tout soutien nous permet de trouver l'énergie d’avancer !  Si vous ne pouvez pas nous soutenir financièrement, vous pouvez nous aider autrement en partageant cette page sur les réseaux sociaux ou sur le site indiegogo. Merci pour votre soutien à cette campagne.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>This is a funding campaign to help me complete production of my book, titled
“<strong>Generations: Following A Family Of Bald Eagles</strong>.” </p>
<p>After a series of personal setbacks, I was undecided about what to do
with my life.  It was at that time I discovered a family of eagles
nesting close by. I became fascinated by them and set out to get some pictures.
My initial plan was to just get ""some good pictures""....<br/><br/>
Soon those few pictures turned in to a dream of documentating one year in the life of an eagle. Little did I realize that one year of photography would turn in to three years,
and, that through the time I spent documenting this family of eagles, I would
gain more insight about my life, my spirituality and my place in this world
than I could ever have imagined.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about eagles but I also learned much about myself.<em> And through it all, I was
lucky enough to spend many mornings watching these majestic creatures raise
their young.</em></p>
<p><em>Now after three years, it's time to share these photographs and to tell their
story</em>.</p>
<p>This 3 year photography project follows the life of two adult bald eagles
and their offspring. Between spring of 2012 and fall of 2014, I spent countless
hours watching and photographing two adult bald eagles that make their home in
the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.
</p>
<p>This project documents through photos the beauty, grace, power and majesty
of our national bird. I photographed these eagles and their offspring
year-round capturing rare moments in their life. Readers will get to view
aspects of these birds that most people never see including hunting, building a
new nest, mating, raising their young, feeding and preparing their offspring to
leave the nest. I was lucky enough to even capture a rare moment of a baby
eagle’s first flight. </p>
<p>This book will be a photographic/art book about the two eagles and their
offspring. It is also a journal of my life during those three years and how
nature and wildlife had a positive impact on me. It is meant to get people
interested in these birds and encourage them to visit the parks and areas where
these birds live and to have a new appreciation for these birds.</p><p>I also have quotes from various peoplpe that I met during this project who recall their stories about seeing these eagles for the first time.</p>
<p>This funding campaign will help to do the following:</p>

<li>Complete production of a

<li>Allow for production and
     distribution of FREE copies of an eBook version for students and teachers. </li>
<li>Provide a base funding amount
     for further documentation  of this pair of Bald Eagles to be incorporated
     in the eBook on future  updates.</li>
<li>Provide a base of support to
     cover expenses for the author to give free lectures and presentations.</li>

</div></div>","OUR MANTRABeneath the beating heart of OneOfAKind Photography Adventures is a collective of landscape photographers who are working to change the way we share information about photography locations from all over the world. For those of us that love creating in the outdoors; location is everything. It is what inspires us, drives us and defines us. 
We no longer want to continue the tradition of “Chinese Whispers” about where to take a great photograph - We want to celebrate the beauty for all to see. We believe in collating the details of all these amazing places and rolling it into a neat little app, ready for use in the field. Whether you’re a photographer or just love travelling and exploring, this App will be essential for you. 

THE APP

The first App of its kind, is designed to be your photographic companion. It is your location bible, weatherman, tour guide, future planner and local tipster as you traverse the earth in search of beautiful locations, one after the other.With its abundance of useful features, you will never find yourself short of inspiration or information: 

Ability to search for locations by photographer/contributor 
Ability to search for locations by type of image – ie, cityscape, abstract, landscape 
Search based on your GPS location or by a country 
How to get there, when is best to see a location 
Sunrise/Sunset azimuth locations 
Up to date weather information 
Map and Latitude/Longitude details 
Planner: add favourite locations to your planner for later reference 
Tips from the photographer who shot it 
Locations supplied are from worldwide professional landscape photographers, vetted for authenticity by the OOAK App management group



All of these amazing features are packed into a clean, delicate and beautiful user interface that is packed with features and enhancements to make the user experience as much fun as travelling.




THE PROGRESS

We launched our free OneOfAKind Location Guide to Apple iOS in November 2014 as proof of concept and the response has been nothing short of amazing. Since launching, we have amassed some pretty cool stats and reviews:

200 contributors from industry leading photographers all over the world 
1500 amazing locations submitted
7500 downloads

User Reviews such as:
“Congratulations on providing this tremendous App to photographers around the world. The app revolutionises the process of finding locations and will encourage photographers to share their work and expertise with a much wider audience.” - Peter Anthony
”Brillant app and a must for any travelling photographers tool kit!” - Bruce Hood
“This app is great. Easy to use and very informative about where locations are and best times to shoot them. I've already started planning an overseas trip using this app. Easy to contribute too also if you are keen to share some of your spots with others. 5/5 stars for me :)” - Brian Fairy

<span class=""notranlsate""><h3>What is <em>Stand Alone Cosplay</em>?</h3>
<p><em>Stand Alone Cosplay</em> (<em>S.A.C.</em>) is an academic research project being conducted by Sharon Elkind M.A. from the University of Sydney in Australia.

<p><span>ArtistsActivists.ORG is an affiliate of America Educates, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C.</span><br/><span>Our mission is to provide design services and to conduct art and design workshops with kids around the world. </span></p>
<p>Kids Peace Photography is ArtistsActivists' program to teach children who don't otherwise have access to cameras about the power of images. In unplanned settlements (slums), post-disaster areas, post-conflict areas, and poor neighborhoods around the world we help children find a voice through the artistic expression. Through photography, children show the world people and things that are important to them in their community. They process trauma, find hope, and focus on peace.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Artists Activists taught photography to children in Haiti and Africa. You can see the kids' photos from these workshops in the image above and many more photos that children took on our site, ArtistsActivists.org.</p>
<p>We did it with borrowed cameras.</p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong> We have contacts ready in Colombia, Haiti, and Kenya to teach more workshop, but we want to own cameras we can use again and again--not borrow them each time. in With $1000, we will buy 10 permanent high-quality cameras to keep teaching kids' peace photography in 2012. </p>
<p><strong>What you get: </strong> Donations at $20 or higher get you perks like signed thank-you cards or mounted prints to hang on your wall featuring a photo taken by a child in one of our Kids Peace Photography workshops. But donate as much or as little as you can--it's about kids learning photography and knowing you made it possible!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>10</strong><strong> cameras teach a class of 30-40 kids: </strong>In our classes and workshops, we like to have three or four children per camera for a few reasons: 1) When one child is taking a picture, having at least two other kids on the other side of the cameras helps to make dynamic images. 2) Kids learn creativity and photography skills from each other, not to mention sharing and helping younger children. 3) we teach in areas that can be dangerous, like the notorious slums of Kibera and Cite Soleil, so having a group of children and one adult around each camera makes for a safer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Please help us get to our goal! </strong>You can buy a pretty nice digital camera for $100, and for $1000 we can buy 10. If we buy more cameras, we will leave one camera at each new location, with a children's organization to make sure it is shared and properly used. If we don't make our goal, we will buy fewer cameras and teach smaller workshops until our goal is met.</p>

<h3>The Plan </h3>
<div>On July 1st, I will travel to a boarding school in Rome where I will spend 5 weeks as a staff member for two summer programs for high school students.  After the program ends, I will spend a few days traveling the country before flying back to the United States. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Why this is exciting: </div>
<div>-This will be my first trip overseas.  Going to Italy has always been my dream and it's finally coming true.  </div>
<div>-I will have some free time every day to explore the city and take photographs. </div>
<div>-I will get to travel with the program (and on my own) to cities throughout Italy, and I will get to take photographs of those places as well.  </div>
<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3>This is where you come in. </h3>
<p>I want to print photo books of my journey, but I need your help to do it.  Your contribution would enable me to pay for the production of the photo books as well as the printing and shipping for my other awards.  Any extra money would enable me to travel to more cities where I could take more pictures.  If I don't reach the project goal, I will still use the money for the books and prints, but fewer of them will be produced.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The photographs in the book will span my six weeks in Italy.  I plan to include photos from Rome, Florence, Pompeii, Orvieto, Venice, and anywhere else I have the opportunity to go.  I will post some of the photographs on Flickr (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaylasmith/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaylasmith/</a>) during my trip so you can get a preview of the book and (for those who contribute $25 or more) pick which photos you'd like prints of.  </p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">In 1910, when the world map had achieved its final shape, and it seemed as if there was nothing left to be discovered, 65 men decided to take the ultimate adventure: reaching the South Pole. The Terra Nova, a British expedition named after its supply ship, was established. It was led by Robert Falcon Scott.</span><b><br/></b>

<p>But this was not the end of it.</p>
<p>A century later, the summer melt of 2013 at Scott’s Hut (Cape Evans, Antarctica) revealed a hidden relic from the Terra Nova Expedition. It was George Murray Levick’s notebook. Levick, who was the expedition’s surgeon and zoologist, took many photographs during the trip.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450741034/bmyazadt7ipyjwd73a00.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Somehow Levick’s notebook was left behind when Terra Nova departed from Antarctica in February 1913, but it has now been restored by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and returned to Scott’s hut at Cape Evans. Our project was inspired by this rare find that remained hidden for more than 100 years. This notebook was titled the “Wellcome Photographic Exposure Record and Diary 1910.” It included such details as the photograph dates, descriptions and exposure times.</p>
<p>We cherish the photographers who took place in the Terra Nova expedition, risking their lives for the sake of universal knowledge. They took photos under the harshest conditions, including severe winds, freezing temperatures, and lack of food. Their feat deserves to be acknowledged. For this reason, we are devoting this project to all the bold, adventurous photographers who give up their comfort, health, and sometimes even their lives, for the sake of stunning photographs.</p>
<p>We, Team Galaxy, have quite an extensive collection of photographers’ notebooks from the past. The oldest one goes all the way back to 1907! This was even before Scott’s famed expedition. In our search for content, quality, and design we’ve looked through several types of notebooks.</p>

<p>Galaxy has developed a handbook that encompasses your entire photography activities, from jotting down daily plans, keeping information about major photo events, holding a special logbook for your pictures, and beyond.</p>
<p>When you shoot with a digital camera after having used an analog one, you realize that among the other advantages of a digital camera, you also get a lot of information (aperture, shutter speed, location, etc.) conveniently wrapped in a file as metadata for each picture. Analog photographers don’t have this luxury. If they want to keep up with their technologically enabled colleagues, they need to maintain a record of what, how and where they are shooting. That is why one of the most important tools in a photographer's bag is a professional notebook.</p>
<p>Galaxy Photographers’ Planner and Handbook is the hub for all your creative ideas, goals, inspirations and a source of handy information. Imagine this professionally printed and bound handbook where you will capture the things you are doing as well as the things you want to be doing. This handbook will give you the comfort of having all the essential information for your photo shoots handy. </p>
<p>We strive to create a universal professional design for our handbook. <br/>It has a leather hardcover that comes in either Deep Red or Obsidian Black. <br/>Its thick paper is perfect for your notes. <br/>The size is compact enough to fit in any bag, yet large enough to let you take notes. <br/>The excellent printing will not fade away with time. <br/>And due to its informational compound, this handbook qualifies as a real book with its own ISBN-number, 978-0-9969884-0-7.</p>
<p>All types of analog photographers will find this Handbook useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Professionals.</b> Professionalism goes hand in hand with perfectionism (and we mean it in the best way possible). This handbook is designed specially to keep all your photo notes in perfect condition so that you may precisely figure out the right recipe for your best shot.</li>
<li>
<b>Large Format Photographers.</b> The section for large format photographs includes such graphs as Holder #, Film type, Lens, Bellows, Filter, Meter readings, Adjusted Exposure Value, Reciprocity.</li>
<li>
<b>Pinhole Photographers</b>. Our brothers in arms sometimes unjustly forgotten... We have records sheets and a lot of useful information for you too.</li>
<li>
<b>Amateurs.</b> Photographers who take pictures for pleasure, usually do it occasionally. It’s easy to forget what helped you achieve a great photography effect. Keeping notes will provide you material with which to work on your skills.</li>
<li>
<b>Students.</b> Cheat sheets, infographics, recipes for the development process – no need to flip through textbooks as we have gathered all the needed info in one place.</li>
<li>
<b>Alternative Photographers.</b> Our “Darkroom Records” section is great for writing down various development options and keeping track of what effect each option gives. </li>
<li>
<b>Anybody who loves photography.</b> This Handbook is the link between photography’s present and past. You have a chance to become part of photography’s history as we bring back to life a classic photographer’s notebook from the beginning of the last century.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you are a professional photographer or a student; this handbook will become your best aide!</p>

You might know us by our recent project on recreating the direct positive photo paper that Kodak manufactured about 70 years ago (<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/galaxy-hyper-speed-direct-positive-photo-paper/x/13034251#/%C2%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/galaxy-hyper...</a>) (you might even have supported our debut project, in which case, a big shout out to you, great friend!). The  community warmly welcomed this project, and we decided to devote our time to reviving the art and paraphernalia of analog photography.<br/>
</div></div>","In 1910, when the world map had achieved its final shape, and it seemed as if there was nothing left to be discovered, 65 men decided to take the ultimate adventure: reaching the South Pole. The Terra Nova, a British expedition named after its supply ship, was established. It was led by Robert Falcon Scott.

Scott’s expedition aimed to carry out extensive exploration and scientific experiments. Unfortunately, the Norwegian Amundsen who lead a rival expedition with the same goal, outrun it by 34 days. Not only that, but Scott and his crew died on their way back.


But this was not the end of it.
A century later, the summer melt of 2013 at Scott’s Hut (Cape Evans, Antarctica) revealed a hidden relic from the Terra Nova Expedition. It was George Murray Levick’s notebook. Levick, who was the expedition’s surgeon and zoologist, took many photographs during the trip.

Somehow Levick’s notebook was left behind when Terra Nova departed from Antarctica in February 1913, but it has now been restored by the Antarctic Heritage Trust and returned to Scott’s hut at Cape Evans. Our project was inspired by this rare find that remained hidden for more than 100 years. This notebook was titled the “Wellcome Photographic Exposure Record and Diary 1910.” It included such details as the photograph dates, descriptions and exposure times.
We cherish the photographers who took place in the Terra Nova expedition, risking their lives for the sake of universal knowledge. They took photos under the harshest conditions, including severe winds, freezing temperatures, and lack of food. Their feat deserves to be acknowledged. For this reason, we are devoting this project to all the bold, adventurous photographers who give up their comfort, health, and sometimes even their lives, for the sake of stunning photographs.
We, Team Galaxy, have quite an extensive collection of photographers’ notebooks from the past. The oldest one goes all the way back to 1907! This was even before Scott’s famed expedition. In our search for content, quality, and design we’ve looked through several types of notebooks.




Since George Murray Levick’s notebook is one of the reasons we’re creating our Galaxy Handbook, we’d like to dedicate it to the Terra Nova expedition and feature some real photographs from this trip in it. In addition, $5 from each pledge will be donated to the Antarctic Heritage Trust in New Zealand, who unearthed and restored the notebook.


To learn more about the Terra Nova expedition you can watch this wonderful documentary, “90 Degrees South,” comprised of footage by Herbert George Ponting, a professional photographer and member of Robert Falcon Scott's expedition. The introduction is by Admiral Edward Russell Evans, who was second-in-command and accompanied Scott to within 150 miles of the Pole.


Galaxy has developed a handbook that encompasses your entire photography activities, from jotting down daily plans, keeping information about major photo events, holding a special logbook for your pictures, and beyond.
When you shoot with a digital camera after having used an analog one, you realize that among the other advantages of a digital camera, you also get a lot of information (aperture, shutter speed, location, etc.) conveniently wrapped in a file as metadata for each picture. Analog photographers don’t have this luxury. If they want to keep up with their technologically enabled colleagues, they need to maintain a record of what, how and where they are shooting. That is why one of the most important tools in a photographer's bag is a professional notebook.
Galaxy Photographers’ Planner and Handbook is the hub for all your creative ideas, goals, inspirations and a source of handy information. Imagine this professionally printed and bound handbook where you will capture the things you are doing as well as the things you want to be doing. This handbook will give you the comfort of having all the essential information for your photo shoots handy. 
We strive to create a universal professional design for our handbook. It has a leather hardcover that comes in either Deep Red or Obsidian Black. Its thick paper is perfect for your notes. The size is compact enough to fit in any bag, yet large enough to let you take notes. The excellent printing will not fade away with time. And due to its informational compound, this handbook qualifies as a real book with its own ISBN-number, 978-0-9969884-0-7.
All types of analog photographers will find this Handbook useful:


Professionals. Professionalism goes hand in hand with perfectionism (and we mean it in the best way possible). This handbook is designed specially to keep all your photo notes in perfect condition so that you may precisely figure out the right recipe for your best shot.

Large Format Photographers. The section for large format photographs includes such graphs as Holder #, Film type, Lens, Bellows, Filter, Meter readings, Adjusted Exposure Value, Reciprocity.

Pinhole Photographers. Our brothers in arms sometimes unjustly forgotten... We have records sheets and a lot of useful information for you too.

Amateurs. Photographers who take pictures for pleasure, usually do it occasionally. It’s easy to forget what helped you achieve a great photography effect. Keeping notes will provide you material with which to work on your skills.

Students. Cheat sheets, infographics, recipes for the development process – no need to flip through textbooks as we have gathered all the needed info in one place.

Alternative Photographers. Our “Darkroom Records” section is great for writing down various development options and keeping track of what effect each option gives. 

Anybody who loves photography. This Handbook is the link between photography’s present and past. You have a chance to become part of photography’s history as we bring back to life a classic photographer’s notebook from the beginning of the last century.

It doesn’t matter if you are a professional photographer or a student; this handbook will become your best aide!

</div><p><span><strong>INSIDE THE PROJECT</strong></span></p><p><span></span><strong> </strong></p><p><span><strong>About the title</strong></span></p><p><strong>     “<span>Fog” is a poetic concept to describe the contemporary condition in which we live our present. We live in a time of great potentiality for the Arts. At the same time, it is easy to lose one’s sense of direction among them; like in a foggy landscape. To <span>try to see “beyond the fog” stands for </span>my personal attempt to find and define a direction<span>.</span></span></strong></p><strong><span><span><p><span></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span><strong>My idea of landscape</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>     I am very fascinated by the Photography and Literature of the 30s. This period fascinates me because of the synthesis between idealism and realism <span>it presents</span></span><span>: order and synthesis <span>at once.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>     F</span>or my Master Thesis in Fine Art I researched the Italian photographer Mario Bellavista (1907-1990) and Italian photography between World War I and II (see <a href=""http://www.associazionetargaoro.it/mario-bellavista/fotografare-in-sintoniabrcon-i-tempi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.associazionetargaoro.it/mario-bellavista/fotografare-in-sintoniabrcon-i-tempi</a> )</span><span>. My particular focus has been on the approach of Bellavista, and his colleagues, to the landscape. Their thoughts and their works have influenced my way of thinking about <span>the photographic image</span></span><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>     During the 20s and 30s, with the arrival on the market of small size cameras and with the popularity of a modernist taste, many photographers explored new ways to represent the landscape. They abandoned the pictorial and romantic approach they had used until then – although historically key to the maturation of photography as a form of art. Foggy landscapes and large horizons were replaced<br/>with small portions of reality, as fragments of the scenery of modern life</strong></span><span><strong>.<br/>The smallest detail in nature, filtered by the photographer’s personality, could show the expressive power of a work of art.</strong></span></p>
<p><span></span><strong> </strong></p>
<span><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/964059/files/20141027154916-DSCF3906.jpg?1414450156"" src="""" style=""width: 402px; height: 524px;""/></strong></p></span><span><p><strong>M. Storer, <em>Origami</em>, Milano, luglio 2014.</strong></p></span><p><span></span><strong> </strong></p>
<span><p><strong> <span><span>     I believe the approach I am describing has a significance with respect to our present situation and the potential </span>to lead to a new way to represent and document the contemporary. </span><span>Today anything can be photographed and immediately shared with the whole world. Thus, <span>I propose there is an analogy between this contemporary mode and the aesthetics with which in the 30s anything could be represented with beauty. I believe that we have the possibility to learn from this parallelism.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>     </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/964067/files/20141027155041-DSCF0520.jpg?1414450241"" src="""" style=""width: 307.5px; height: 410px;""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>M. Storer, Distanza, Milano, dicembre 2013.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>     <span><span>I believe, just like then, human questions on the sense of beauty and our need for it in our life are still persistently actual. Without stepping back from the challenges of the contemporary, I think we need to reconnect to the tradition of beauty that, through different forms and aesthetic outcomes, traversed the history of art and which today we tend to forget.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>About my method</strong></p>
<p><strong>     The examples of photographs provided show that the language of this project takes a distance from the style of the photographic reportage. They favor instead a slow and meditative way of photographing, in adherence to the pictures of the art masters.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>     For instance the pine tree I found in Florence during a walk can be documented and represented with the same elegance and delicacy of a Beato Angelico painting (see above </span><span><em>Omaggio a Fra Angelico</em></span><em><span><span>, also available at: </span></span></em><u><a href=""http://www.matteostorer.com/#!matteo-storer-fotografia/csoj"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>http://www.matteostorer.com/#!matteo-storer-fotografia/csoj</span></span></a></u><span><span><span>).</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><br/><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span><em><strong>About my poems</strong></em></span></p>
<p><strong><em>     </em><span><span><em>The research at the core of </em></span><span><em>Beyond the Fog</em></span></span><span><span><em>, will develop by engaging a dialogue between photography and poetry. The rhythm of the narration will adapt on the characteristics of the two expressive languages.</em></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>     </em><span><span><em>As in my photography work, in the past years (2012-2013), I have often chosen the language of poetry to describe human life in relation to the landscape. My writings too are very much influenced by the poetry of the 30s: Italian poetry (Cesare Pavese over all) and international poetry (Thomas Stearns Eliot, Boris Pasternack, Jules Supervielle).</em></span></span></strong></p>
<p><em></em><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>These are examples of my poems: </em><u><a href=""http://www.matteostorer.com/#!vuoto/c16e2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><em>http://www.matteostorer.com/#!vuoto/c16e2</em></span></span></a></u><span><em>.</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span><strong>About the book</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>     <span>I would like to realize a hard cover book of approximately 100 pages. The specifics of </span><span><em>Beyond the fog </em></span><span>book – size, paper, font, materials,... – will be decided according to the development of the project and published on my website: </span><u><a href=""http://www.matteostorer.com/#!progetti-in-corso/c1en6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>http://www.matteostorer.com/#!progetti-in-corso/c1en6</span></span></a></u><span>.</span></strong></p>

<p><span></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span><strong>WHAT I PLAN TO DO WITH THE FIRST 2000 € AND YOUR HELP</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span>To	carry out the first part of the work, I plan to do an artist 	residency in Paris (I am presently searching for support structures to do this). Half of my pictures for the project will be of French landscapes. The reason for choosing Paris is because it is very modern in photography, both in the historical research and in its cultural proposal. Alongside, I plan to spend time studying the catalogues of French photographic exhibitions of the 30s, focusing my attention on landscape photographs made by Italian photographers of the period. </span><span>From this study I expect to improve my knowledge about the relationships between Italy and France in the 30s. I hope to shape the cultural proposal of my project also on the interest of the French public. In fact, during my researches in Paris, I will look for art and photography galleries with an interest in my project.</span><br/></strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Buy the necessary materials and equipment to shoot the photographs and<br/>	write the poems. Meet the costs of high quality prints and to produce the first copy of the book.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span><strong>With the other 2000 € and your help I will print the first numbered edition of <br/>Beyond the Fog.</strong></span></p>
<p><br/><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>
<p><strong>     I was born in Milan in 1988.</strong></p>

     Beyond the fog is an art project aiming to investigate a new aesthetic approach to the landscape in Photography and Poetry, developed from researching the history of Italian photography between World War I and II.     The project will take the form of a photo book with 30 photos and 30 poems,to be shared on the web and in Italian and French art galleries.

     Gradual updates about Beyond the Fog will become available online on my website: http://www.matteostorer.com/#!progetti-in-corso/c1en6.

 

Examples of  the photos I want to include in the project:

 

 

M. Storer, Omaggio a Fra Angelico, Firenze, aprile 2014.

  



M. Storer, Como, Como, luglio 2014.

  

 


INSIDE THE PROJECT About the title     “Fog” is a poetic concept to describe the contemporary condition in which we live our present. We live in a time of great potentiality for the Arts. At the same time, it is easy to lose one’s sense of direction among them; like in a foggy landscape. To try to see “beyond the fog” stands for my personal attempt to find and define a direction. 
My idea of landscape
     I am very fascinated by the Photography and Literature of the 30s. This period fascinates me because of the synthesis between idealism and realism it presents: order and synthesis at once.
     For my Master Thesis in Fine Art I researched the Italian photographer Mario Bellavista (1907-1990) and Italian photography between World War I and II (see http://www.associazionetargaoro.it/mario-bellavista/fotografare-in-sintoniabrcon-i-tempi ). My particular focus has been on the approach of Bellavista, and his colleagues, to the landscape. Their thoughts and their works have influenced my way of thinking about the photographic image.
     During the 20s and 30s, with the arrival on the market of small size cameras and with the popularity of a modernist taste, many photographers explored new ways to represent the landscape. They abandoned the pictorial and romantic approach they had used until then – although historically key to the maturation of photography as a form of art. Foggy landscapes and large horizons were replacedwith small portions of reality, as fragments of the scenery of modern life.The smallest detail in nature, filtered by the photographer’s personality, could show the expressive power of a work of art.
 
M. Storer, Origami, Milano, luglio 2014. 
      I believe the approach I am describing has a significance with respect to our present situation and the potential to lead to a new way to represent and document the contemporary. Today anything can be photographed and immediately shared with the whole world. Thus, I propose there is an analogy between this contemporary mode and the aesthetics with which in the 30s anything could be represented with beauty. I believe that we have the possibility to learn from this parallelism.
     

M. Storer, Distanza, Milano, dicembre 2013.
 
     I believe, just like then, human questions on the sense of beauty and our need for it in our life are still persistently actual. Without stepping back from the challenges of the contemporary, I think we need to reconnect to the tradition of beauty that, through different forms and aesthetic outcomes, traversed the history of art and which today we tend to forget.
 
 
About my method
     The examples of photographs provided show that the language of this project takes a distance from the style of the photographic reportage. They favor instead a slow and meditative way of photographing, in adherence to the pictures of the art masters.
     For instance the pine tree I found in Florence during a walk can be documented and represented with the same elegance and delicacy of a Beato Angelico painting (see above Omaggio a Fra Angelico, also available at: http://www.matteostorer.com/#!matteo-storer-fotografia/csoj).
 
About my poems
     The research at the core of Beyond the Fog, will develop by engaging a dialogue between photography and poetry. The rhythm of the narration will adapt on the characteristics of the two expressive languages.
     As in my photography work, in the past years (2012-2013), I have often chosen the language of poetry to describe human life in relation to the landscape. My writings too are very much influenced by the poetry of the 30s: Italian poetry (Cesare Pavese over all) and international poetry (Thomas Stearns Eliot, Boris Pasternack, Jules Supervielle).
 
These are examples of my poems: http://www.matteostorer.com/#!vuoto/c16e2.
 
 
About the book
     I would like to realize a hard cover book of approximately 100 pages. The specifics of Beyond the fog book – size, paper, font, materials,... – will be decided according to the development of the project and published on my website: http://www.matteostorer.com/#!progetti-in-corso/c1en6.
 
 
WHAT I PLAN TO DO WITH THE FIRST 2000 € AND YOUR HELP

To	carry out the first part of the work, I plan to do an artist 	residency in Paris (I am presently searching for support structures to do this). Half of my pictures for the project will be of French landscapes. The reason for choosing Paris is because it is very modern in photography, both in the historical research and in its cultural proposal. Alongside, I plan to spend time studying the catalogues of French photographic exhibitions of the 30s, focusing my attention on landscape photographs made by Italian photographers of the period. From this study I expect to improve my knowledge about the relationships between Italy and France in the 30s. I hope to shape the cultural proposal of my project also on the interest of the French public. In fact, during my researches in Paris, I will look for art and photography galleries with an interest in my project.
Buy the necessary materials and equipment to shoot the photographs and	write the poems. Meet the costs of high quality prints and to produce the first copy of the book.

 
With the other 2000 € and your help I will print the first numbered edition of Beyond the Fog.
 
ABOUT ME
     I was born in Milan in 1988.
     I studied Set Design and Painting at Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan.
     I currently live and work in Milan.
 
     Last july I graduated in Painting with a thesis project titled La fotografia come arte del vivere per Mario Bellavista - Un fotografo amatore fra le due guerre.In that occasion I presented some of the photos which have become the start point of Beyond the Fog.
 
 

Discussion of my Master thesis in july 2014. From left to right: me; Painting Professor Italo Bressan; History of Photography Professor Anna Maria Amonaci; Prof. Gaetano Grillo; Prof. Giordano Montorsi.
 
     In 2011 I realized a thesis project (in Set Design) titled Miquel Barcelò e un lavoro sul mare. On that occasion I also presented a performance project: Il nare - quasi mare (http://www.matteostorer.com/#!matteo-storer-arti-visive-2/c1wfd).
     My complete art work is available on the website www.matteostorer.comdivided in sections: Photography, Visual Arts, Set Design, Writings. The website is currently available only in Italian, but will be soon updated to an English version.

<p>We at Made In America: Where Are My Rights? strive to educate the public on the struggles the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and The Ally community faces. </p>
<p>Our goal is to create a series of books to showcase the photos and stories of the LGBTA community. The only problem is that it is quite costly to create and publish them. That's where you come in. </p>
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Whether you realize it or not, members of the LGBTA community are all around you. You've probably already interacted with one today - at the bank, in your office, or on the sidewalk. They deserve the same rights as everyone else, and one way to help that happen is to tell their story. </p>

<h3>Where will the money go?</h3>
<p>Travel expenses - there are LGBTA community members all over the country who deserve to have their story told - we just need a way to get to them!</p>
<p>Event Registrations - Pride organizations around the country charge a vendor fee... we definitely need to be where the people are.</p>

Maybe someone you share my project with will want to help make this possible. Use the sharing buttons on this page to spread the word - I am eternally grateful for any and all help and support from everyone! Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
