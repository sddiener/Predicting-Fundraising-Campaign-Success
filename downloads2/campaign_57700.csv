<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>“It started with a drawing on a napkin.”</strong> We’ve all heard that phrase a time or two in our lives.  Our product has that same humble beginning.  Almost 4 years ago, we made sketches on a napkin in a restaurant as we began to conceptualize a product which had all the necessary tools built-in to safely carry out an investigation, document evidence, apprehend fleeing suspects, locate missing persons, provide light in the darkness, detect dangerous heat sources…and save lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are an American company which has bootstrapped its way through all the developmental challenges to bring a unique High-Tech Tool into existence.  We are comprised of a small group of individuals with vision, determination, expertise and long-term commitment.  In a short period of time, the napkin sketches evolved into a number of hand-built prototypes for public safety experts to utilize and to provide us with their real-world feedback.  Now we have taken the valuable data and sculpted a final, production-ready, world-class product with all the suggested changes and improvements included.  We have designed and machined our own Injection Tooling for the fabrication of the Impact –Resistant enclosures.  We have secured the supplier agreements for all the major components necessary to assemble this amazing tool in production quantities.  We have been granted the trademarks and have patents pending which will protect our efforts in bringing this distinctive product to market.  We are poised to grow.  We are poised to create jobs.  Our product has been PROVEN to save lives. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Now…we need your help.</strong>  We are in need of funds to purchase raw materials and components to build the first large production quantities of our product.  We also plan to hire, train and support the growth of additional production personnel and a full-time International Sales Team.  If you have any experience in sales, you know that it takes a considerable amount of time and consistent effort for the sales cycle to bear fruit.  An enormous amount of groundwork must be laid in order for the actual Purchase Orders to begin to arrive.  During the ramp-up, the production staff and the sales team still must be funded for their efforts and expenses. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have turned to crowd-funding because we believe America is still the land of opportunity.  We believe people from all over the world still have an inherent belief in entrepreneurship, vision, hard work and determination.  Please help our company grow.  Please help us to provide jobs to those who desperately need them.  Please help us to bring to market a product which has been proven to save lives.</p>

<h3>Eddie's fight with ALS</h3>
<p><em>About me...</em></p>
<p>Eddie Lopez was first diagnosed with the Lou Gehrig's disease in late 2011.  Before then, Eddie and his wife, Angie, dedicated their lives to raising 3 children and two grandchildren.  Eddie's father trusted Eddie to run the family plumbing business.  Since the beginning, he has faithfully worked to serve the people in Tucson Arizona and surrounding areas.  He is a son, a father, and a grandfather.  2011 changed everything. They now need our help.</p>
<p>Eddie is my brother-in-law who has ALS.  His wife's health has deteriorated rapidly and his daughter has been struggling to care for both of her parents.  Their funds have been exhausted and the family is in serious debt.  Eddie desperately needs a van converted for disabled in order to be transported by wheelchair to his appointments.  The family needs to raise $25,000 to purchase the van and related medical needs not covered by insurance.</p>
<p><em>Eddie, the son, father and grandfather...</em></p>
<p>Eddie was one of the most honest and trusted plumbing contractors and business man in the Tucson area for over 40 years.  His career as a master plumber came to an abrupt halt in 2007, although he did not realize it at the time.  He continued to help those who needed his services without requiring upfront payment.  He used his savings with the hope that he will be repaid by customers.  He continued to pay his employees, but unemployment and financial distress by many of his clients left Eddie with a decision - to use his own savings or to shut the company.  He and his wife decided to use their savings.  It decreased rapidly to zero, then to debt, then left them wondering how they can keep a roof over their heads.  His health began to fail in 2009.  By late 2011, he could no longer work; even moving around on his own was difficult.  As of today, he is wheelchair bound, has a tracheostomy, cannot walk or lift his body.  He has limited use of his arms, his coordination is poor, he cannot feed himself, he cannot clean himself, and he needs round the clock care and supervision.</p>
<p>Angie was overwhelmed with trying to keep the company alive, caring for her husband and raising two of their grandchildren.  Angie soon became ill herself with a serious heart condition that has kept her in and out of hospitals for the past year, and she's been reduced to less than 100lbs.  Their daughter resigned at her job, is caring for her mother and father, in addition to raise her daughter and her niece/nephew.</p>
<p><em>Where the funds will go...</em></p>
<p>Please help raise $25,000 to purchase a specially equipped handicap van that will provide the mobility Eddie desperately needs.  Any amount you can donate will go directly to fund this purchase. Whether it's $1,000, $100, $10 or $1; anything will help.  Even if you cannot contribute financially at this time, please help spread the word in any way you can (e-mail, facebook, twitter, word of mouth, phonecalls, anything you can do).</p>
<p>Words cannot express my gratitude for your generosity.  Having transportation for Eddie will help in unimaginable ways.  If you need further information on this campaign, please e-mail or call me.  My e-mail address is <a href=""mailto:g.grisel.salazar@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">g.grisel.salazar@gmail.com</a>.  My phone number is 201-320-3394.</p>
<p>In the case more than $25,000 is raised, the additional funds will be donated to the ALS Foundation, Arizona Chapter (webaz.alsa.org).</p>

<p><strong><br/></strong>The video above was put together by my wonderful friend and VERY active advocate for EB, CHRISTIE ZINK. These are photo's she took of me assisting my beautiful friend Vanessa with her sons dressing change (preparing for the care our baby will need when he gets home!), I love this sweet little guy and his smile and his story makes me even more determined to get my baby home!  I am so honored to have these amazing people as a part of my life!  </p>
<h3><em><strong>PLEASE help us save our son!</strong> <br/></em></h3>
<p><br/><em>My name is Tona Crooker. My husband William and I have 4 young kids at home and knew it was time to expand our family. Unfortunately I have had serious complications in my prior pregnancies and we felt it was safest not to try that again. We chose to adopt. What we didn't know was just how hard this road could be. We love each and every one of our children and would do anything to keep them safe and to protect them. But in the world of adoption it is NOT that easy.  We love our son,( ""Baby N"" as he is called for now) and we want him to be home with our family as soon as possible. The worst part for me as a mother is knowing he is suffering and NO ONE is there to hold him and love him and comfort him.  </em></p>
<p><em>Baby N was born with a rare genetic skin disorder called Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB).  Most of his entire body is wrapped in Bandages to protect him from serious injury and fatal infections. He NEEDS these bandages to survive, and sadly he can not recieve the full medical attention it will take to give him a fighting chance at life, until we get him home! </em></p>
<p><em> Everyday things can cause serious pain. He can not just put a shirt on like every one else, to him it means new, painful blisters on any unbandaged areas of skin. He can not just scratch his arm or rub his nose if he has a little itch, without ripping his skin right off. He can not be held or touched to be comforted with out extreme caution from his caregivers to prevent new injuries. </em></p>
<p><em>His little body is basically covered in open wounds and he is left susceptible to any and every infection possible. His body is in a constant state of healing for survival, draining all the nutritients he gets and needs to grow, and using it just to survive!</em></p>
<p><em>I can't imagine the pain that any child born with EB goes through, but I am heartbroken just thinking of the pain he has to endure and with no one to love him and comfort him. He has no one to make him feel safe and secure, and he has no idea how hard we are fighting for him here. We need to make sure he does not wait a day longer then he already has to.  We NEED to get to him before it is to late....</em></p>

<h3>We NEED all the help and support we can get!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><em>International adoption is a HUGE expense. And worth EVERY penny. There is no way for me to put a price on any one of my children, and it is devastating that MONEY could stand in our way of giving our sweet baby the chance to fight for survival. EVERY dollar we raise will go directly towards bringing him home.   When it is all said and done we will have spent over $45,000 on this adoption. To me it seems like an insane amount of money to come up with in such a short amount of time, but we are taking it one step at a time.... </em></p>
<p><em>For our next step we need $2,200 - This will complete the paperwork we need to send to the amazing people who are making this possible for us! <br/></em></p>

<p><em>We will need to pay other fees... <br/></em></p>
<p><em>To then move forward from there we will need $3,700, and again it will be to complete more paper work... <br/></em></p>
<p><em>Then we will have travel expenses and in country fees (which all add up VERY quickly), we are NOT including what it will take to provide child care for our children currently at home, while we travel for this adoption, along with the time and pay my husband will miss from work etc. <br/></em></p>

Registration of all Complimentary and Alternative Therapeutic Products (CAMs) is
now required by law in South Africa. All products making any claims that are

<p>Axhilirit
Eczema Products are currently used for assistance in the accelerated healing of
dry and itchy skin such as Eczema and related conditions. Many Psoriasis clients
have also found benefit when using Axhilirit. These products have been
available on-line to members of the public since 2009. Presently we market and
sell mainly on-line, by word of mouth and a small number of health shops and
pharmacies.</p>
<p>Over the
last 20 years, friends and family have made use of the oils for various skin
related complaints including Eczema. It was due to popular demand, and people
finding our products an effective last resort, that we started to sell to the
public. Although the oils were tested and found safe for topical application,
new legislation requires that the method of active ingredient delivery and
proof of efficacy in all alternative therapy products be officially established
in a controlled, clinical environment through a double blind study from a
certified institution. Although we have built up a reputation amongst our
clients for producing excellent quality products that are effective, these
trials will provide added credibility to Healing Oil Products.</p>
<p>In order
to set up the relevant protocols, a sampling will be done of the thousands of contactable clients that we have had up to date. Thanks to loyal clients
that wish to stay in contact we have built up a formidable database. The
sampling will consist of our existing clients completing a questionnaire to
establish the exact condition that they wished to treat, the extent of the
condition, previous products exposed to or used, short clinical history, how
the Axhilirit Eczema product was used, etc. This will then act as a guideline
for the studies. The number of subjects in the studies will depend on the
funding available.</p><p>The funding that we need will be utilised to apply for and obtain a licence to have the products Clinically tested, the design of the testing protocols, the fees charged by the licensed independent institutions that will do the laboratory work and Clinical Trails, and submission to the Medical Control Council. An amount of $100 000 is needed to adhere to the minimum standards for Clinical testing.</p>
<p>We wish
to stay independent in order to keep prices to the end user as affordable as
possible, therefore have decided to go the Crowd Funding route instead of
signing with a pharmaceutical company or drastically increasing the cost of the products to the consumer. We also donate 10% of our production to charities and those that cannot afford to purchase our products, and will not have to curb or reduce this essential service.</p><p>Presently most formal medications and treatments provide temporary relief whereas feedback from our clients indicate that more than 70% of clients obtain long term results, with the balance experiencing less severe flare-ups with longer periods in between. Your contributions will enable more people that suffer with eczema to experience the benefit of our products with the additional confidence provided by Clinical trails.</p><p>Even if you cannot contribute financially, it would be highly appreciated if you could spread the word through social media or word of mouth.</p><p>For more information, please visit our website at <a href=""http://www.healing-oil.co.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.healing-oil.co.za/</a> or our Facebook page at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HealingOilProducts."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/HealingOilProducts.</a></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/489843/files/20140407063009-Axhilirit_Eczema_Products_Banner_25.png?1396877409"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""/><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b><u>Background and Origin of Healing Oil
Products</u></b></p>
<p>The traditional
original recipe for our plant based products dates back to before the First
World War where it was used for infected wounds, but fell into disuse with the
advent of Penicillin. </p>
<p>Throughout
the years, the original blend was used with great success in our household on
infected wounds. Whenever we had a batch of the oils available, friends and
family would ask for some.</p>
<p>In 2004
our lives changed irrevocably when my wife, Hanneli, was caught up in a cooking
oil explosion, leaving her with Third and Second degree burns over 35% of her
body, including her face, neck, hands, arms and both legs from thighs to
ankles. </p>
<p>After
more than a month in ICU and another two weeks in hospital, Hanneli was sent
home with little hope of regaining functionality of her hands and nothing more
that the plastic surgeon could do for her, advising her that she would have to
make peace with the way she looked. We were so involved with the drastic
changes to our way of life, fighting medical insurance and making sure that the
bills get paid, that we did not even think about using our own oil mixture on
her burns.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487211/files/20140406043656-Hanneli_s_Hands_healed_with_Axhilirit_and_Rejuvinit.jpg?1396784216"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Not able
to return to our regular life after this life-changing event, we moved to an
area where Hanneli could enjoy a less stressful lifestyle and focus on healing. </p>
<p>Having
gone without our 'magic oils' for a while, Hanneli's horse suffered a horrific
injury that refused to heal, prompting us to obtain the ingredients to mix
another batch of oils. It was while applying the oils to the horse that most of
the content of the bottle spilt over Hanneli's hands. A while after this
initial treatment of rubbing the spilt oil into her hands due to the soothing
effect it had, she noticed that she could move her wrists all by herself - the
first time in four years! </p>
<p>Excited
about this result, we agreed that she should continue with treatments for
herself whenever she treated the horse. Two weeks later dimples sprouting hairs
started forming on the scars and a noted texture difference could be seen in
the scarring in her face. Another two weeks later and she wanted to die from
the itching as the old scars started regenerating into what could only be
described as resembling her original skin. </p>
<p>Encouraged
by the effect the oils had on Hanneli's skin, I started to experiment with
combinations of essential and plant oils to address all her subsequent skin
issues; from the annoying itching to the unsightly blemishes. Friends with
eczema tried the 'itchy mix' for their itchy eczema and reported back that the
eczema was under control and in some cases had disappeared. The AxhiliritEczema products were developed from
this mixture and have assisted in keeping Hanneli's life-long eczema condition under
control. She has not experienced a flare-up since. </p>

Due to popular demand,
friends and family encouraged us to launch the products so that more people
could benefit from it, and so Healing Oil Products, Axhilirit and Rejuvinit
were born.<br/><p></p><p></p><p><b><u>Feedback from Clients</u></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487220/files/20140406044030-Contact_Dermatitis.jpg?1396784430"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487224/files/20140406044255-Full_Body_Eczema_in_Child.jpg?1396784575"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Tanna’s Axhilirit Eczema story</strong></p>
<p>My
18 year old daughter came back from a weekend away about two years ago with
little blisters on her fingers.  The GP said it looked as if she had
been bitten by bed bugs and gave her medication which did not help. 
Within a few days she had blisters on her feet…. And so the eczema journey
began.</p>
<p>I
have literally spent thousands and thousands 
on various attempts to help her.  These include:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span> Four different types of
cortisone creams and other creams from the doctor</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span> A series of visits to a
dietician to assess her reaction to various foods</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Four months of weekly visits to a
doctor for acupuncture</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Visits to and natural medications from
an iridologist</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Visits to a doctor practicing in
homeopathy</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>And when her blisters were so bad
under her feet that she could not walk, visits to the GP for cortisone shots.</p>
<p>All
of the above seemed to make a slight improvement, but only for a few weeks and
then we were back to square one.</p>
<p>My
husband found the Natural-oils website while trying to research ways of
controlling eczema.</p>
<p>The
final crunch came in July this year, just after her June/July exams.  She
is a very contentious student and stresses a lot at exam time which makes her
eczema worse.  This time, it came out on her hands, feet and face. 
She refused to go to school. I ordered the Axhilirit Eczema Cream and this
product has been the most successful of all my attempts to help her.  I
wanted to share the following photo’s with you to show you how it worked.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487234/files/20140406044533-Tanna_s_Story.jpg?1396784733"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Pic

A further 23% had to use the products a second or third time before the condition was under control and a mere 5% of the clients occasionally have to 'top up' on their treatments to keep their conditions under control. 2% of clients did not respond to Healing Oil Products.Most of the clients contacted are from lower/middle income groups and although they stated that the products had changed their lives and that they were grateful to have been able to use it, just cannot assist financially.Kind RegardsRonald Gibson20.05.2014 ************************************Hi to all

<p>By Eric Cetnarski, Co-Founder</p> <p>Several years ago Malcolm McQuirter and I were working in stressful corporate jobs.   Good health &amp; overall wellness seemed like distant, unachievable goals.  Bouts of insomnia, illness, allergies, etc. become more common. We knew this path was not sustainable. <br/></p>
<p>So we took a risk, quit our jobs, and went back to school. Malcolm received his Master's in Ayurvedic Medicine, and I finished a Master's in Sustainable Management. I also become trained as a Sound Therapist.  In 2013 we joined forces and started Samana+ as a part-time endeavor. (Samana is a Sanskrit term for equilibrium/balance.)</p>
<p><b>We overcame the cycle of stress, fatigue and general dis-ease. We want to share what we have learned with you and our community!</b> <br/></p>
<p>We currently offer Ayurvedic Health &amp; Wellness programs, Sound Therapy, Guided Cleanses, and Workshops. We will soon offer select Ayurvedic body therapies and expanded workshops. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story  
By Eric Cetnarski, Co-Founder Several years ago Malcolm McQuirter and I were working in stressful corporate jobs.   Good health & overall wellness seemed like distant, unachievable goals.  Bouts of insomnia, illness, allergies, etc. become more common. We knew this path was not sustainable. 
So we took a risk, quit our jobs, and went back to school. Malcolm received his Master's in Ayurvedic Medicine, and I finished a Master's in Sustainable Management. I also become trained as a Sound Therapist.  In 2013 we joined forces and started Samana+ as a part-time endeavor. (Samana is a Sanskrit term for equilibrium/balance.)
We overcame the cycle of stress, fatigue and general dis-ease. We want to share what we have learned with you and our community! 
We currently offer Ayurvedic Health & Wellness programs, Sound Therapy, Guided Cleanses, and Workshops. We will soon offer select Ayurvedic body therapies and expanded workshops. 

Successes


We are happy to report that not only are we much calmer and happier, we've been able to help 100+ people improve their quality of life. Some of our successes to date include:


Eliminated or drastically reduced airborne and food allergies for dozens of people. *I'm one of the successes - I had developed seasonal allergies and intolerance to apples and nuts.  After completing our Urban Reset cleanse - I'm almost completely allergy free and can eat apples and nuts again! 
Helped a man with a very rare neurological disease recover. He was nearly bed-ridden and is now surfing again.  (Here is a video he sent us.)


Helped several women with fertility issues. One woman's monthly cycle had stopped completely.  After working with Malcolm she regained regularity. 

Used sound therapy to help a woman with chronic adrenal fatigue balance her energy and sleep cycles.  She is now working again and enthusiastic about life. 
And through our workshops and sound therapy have given many people tools to deal with the stresses of modern urban life. (e.g. Breathing exercises for the bus.) 


Please visit our testimonials page for more stories. 

We are grateful to have helped so many people, and want to expand our offerings. It is time for us to set up our wellness center!

GESUND und glücklich!<br/>Anfang letzten Jahres wurde bei Mimi Brustkrebs diagnostiziert und obwohl sie so unendlich tapfer durch die Chemo gegangen ist hat der Krebs gestreut... Ihre Frauenärztin hatte sich 2 Jahre lang hartnäckig geweigert, diesen Tumor entfernen zu lassen und das Ergebnis ist, dass Mimi nun um ihr Leben kämpfen muss. Die Ärzte sprechen schon von palliativer Chemo - lebensverlängernd und nicht heilend.<br/>Das können und wollen wir nicht hinnehmen!!! Wir haben eine Reihe von vielversprechenden Alternativ-Methoden aufgetan, bei denen nun der finanzielle Aspekt ein Problem wird. Sollten sich die Heidelberger Ärzte gegen eine OP aussprechen kann auch eine kostenintensive OP im Ausland anstehen. Die Zeit ist knapp und Mimi soll alles nur erdenklich mögliche tun können um zu LEBEN! Um GESUND zu werden.<br/>Wir glauben an Wunder und an das Motto niemals aufzugeben - wir hoffen, da draussen ganz viele zu finden, die uns in unserem Projekt unterstützen!

</blockquote></div>","Die Goldeneye Familie möchte im Zuge der Goldeneye FOR A BETTER WORLD-Kampagne Miriam im Kampf gegen den Krebs unterstützen. Denn Miriam gehört zur Familie!Wir alle möchten Mimi wieder so sehen wie auf diesen Bildern! Wenn sie lacht, wenn sie mal wieder hyperaktiv creativ ist, uns mit ihren Fotos und tollen Ideen verzaubert...Wenn sie einfach Mimi ist. GESUND und glücklich!Anfang letzten Jahres wurde bei Mimi Brustkrebs diagnostiziert und obwohl sie so unendlich tapfer durch die Chemo gegangen ist hat der Krebs gestreut... Ihre Frauenärztin hatte sich 2 Jahre lang hartnäckig geweigert, diesen Tumor entfernen zu lassen und das Ergebnis ist, dass Mimi nun um ihr Leben kämpfen muss. Die Ärzte sprechen schon von palliativer Chemo - lebensverlängernd und nicht heilend.Das können und wollen wir nicht hinnehmen!!! Wir haben eine Reihe von vielversprechenden Alternativ-Methoden aufgetan, bei denen nun der finanzielle Aspekt ein Problem wird. Sollten sich die Heidelberger Ärzte gegen eine OP aussprechen kann auch eine kostenintensive OP im Ausland anstehen. Die Zeit ist knapp und Mimi soll alles nur erdenklich mögliche tun können um zu LEBEN! Um GESUND zu werden.Wir glauben an Wunder und an das Motto niemals aufzugeben - wir hoffen, da draussen ganz viele zu finden, die uns in unserem Projekt unterstützen! Eine Blut-Therapie kostet z.B. alleine schon 6.000€, von vielen anderen unterstützenden Mittel wie Ozon etc. gar nicht zu reden...Wir wollen Mimi wieder lachen sehen. Danke für eure Hilfe und eure guten Vibes <3Being one of the most amazing creature we were blessed with to meet & call our friend, our beautiful soul Miriam had to take on a struggle we wish upon nobody.She was diagnosed with breast cancer that spread to the lymphknotes, needless to say the chemo therapy didnt work!! Because we believe in NEVA GIVE UP
we have researched & found many alternative procedures & healing methods.The problem being the financial aspect. This is where we not only urgently ask you to send your prayers, positve thoughts, love, blessings her way but be so kind a find it in your heart & wallet to support us in NEVA GIVE UP!!

<h1>MajiSports</h1>
<p>Namaste! Indiegogo and thank you for checking out MajiSports' MajiMat. MajiSports is an entrepreneurial endeavor of two UCLA Bruins, Giovanni Villa and Ben Kibreab.  MajiSports is focused on innovating and designing research based performance gear for Yoga Athletes.  Our first product is the unique MajiMat.</p>
<p>“<em>Yoga has stretched far beyond its meditative, baggy-sweats roots to become a fashionable lifestyle pursuit appealing as much to competitive marathon runners and college students as it does to om-chanting meditators.</em>” - The New York Times</p>
<p>The traditional yoga mat, which has not fundamentally changed in decades, has not been designed to provide ergonomic cushioning and protection for potential injuries of the knees, wrists and joints.  For too long yoga athletes have interrupted their flow by skipping demanding poses, rolling a towel and putting it under their knees, or folding the edges of their yoga mats to minimize pain and to avoid injuries.  In addition, most yoga practice is done in studios with hardwood floors and a typical yoga mat does not provide the necessary cushioning and protection from poses that involves balancing your whole body weight on one knee.  As most yoga practitioners, we experienced these issues in our daily yoga practice.  After suffering during hundreds of yoga classes, we decided to do something about it and design a more functional yoga mat that would provide the necessary joint protection while improving our yoga practice.</p>
<p>It took us two years to go from concept to a market tested prototype.  We worked with an Orthopedic Surgeon, Physical Therapist and Yoga athletes to design and develop the MajiMat.  The MajiMat is made from eco-friendly materials.  Now that we have a market tested prototype, we need your help to go from prototype to production.</p>
<h1>The Technology of the MajiMat:</h1>
<p>The MajiMat features an eco-friendly natural rubber surface with a unique three-dimensional pattern and soft texture that provides superior non-slip properties.  The MajiMat offers the space to perform all yoga poses with the benefit of durable impact protection where you need it most without added bulk.  The knee support system is ergonomically designed to contour around the knees for maximum comfort and injury prevention.  The knee and edge support system is engineered from both firm and memory foam for durability and comfort.  The top layer consists of a moister wicking fabric to keep the surface dry and provide maximum performance.  The edge support system is designed with strategically placed ridges to allow the MajiMat to easily roll similar to a standard yoga mat.</p>

<h1>What will Funding be Used For: </h1>
<p>With the help of Indiegogo community we can begin sharing the MajiMat with the world.  The funds raised by Indiegogo  will be used (1) to enhance the design by incorporating the feedback we have received from our test users, (2)  to create the tooling, and (3)  setup and initial production run of the MajiMat.   To produce our prototypes, we worked with a manufacturer in China, but our long-term goal is to manufacture the MajiMat in the United States and do our part to support the U.S. manufacturing industry.  </p>

located in the beautiful city of Vancouver.  I have a dream of bringing
health and wellness to the people of my city.<span> 
Just over a year ago I opened the doors to Tipo Fitness where the
neighborhoods of Strathcona and China town meet (two amazing communities full of
history and flavour).  Although some people may see my business as just a
gym, this endeavor is so much more than this. My goal is to create a meeting
place where people come to talk about their goals and to take the first steps
in becoming a healthier more balanced person, a place to go whether you are new
to fitness or a seasoned pro.  One of the things that I was very conscious
of was to do away with the 'crowded gym' and to refocus back on the client.
 All sessions are private, one on one, aimed at the individual and their needs.
 It's a chance for me to get to know my neighbours on a one on one basis,
eliminating the tendency other gyms have of making individuals feel just like a
number.   I also offer a multitude of classes such as hip hop dancing,
Latin dance, kids dance, yoga, Tipo fit extreme, and martial arts.  Classes
are small, 6-10 people (no over-crowding), with the intention of giving the
instructors a chance to interact with people on a more personal level.  I
feel in the last year I have only scratched the surface of what Tipofit can be and
with your help and support my team and I can continue to give back to the community. </span></b></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have

I was met with resistance and expense from the city and contractors.  On
several occasions we suffered fines and closure due to contractors not having

resulting in Tipofit inciting additional fines. </span></p>

</span></span>Tipofit
was recently the victim of a break in.   As a result we lost lots of
expensive equipment, had to replace damaged property, and incurred the expense
of installing a security system to bring a sense of security back to the gym.
 Because we are a start up company it is not financially possible to
replace these items. Due to the unforeseen setbacks with the city and
contractors, we were forced to cancel our insurance, making it impossible to
make a claim for compensation.</p>
<p>I, we,
need your help with the unexpected financial setbacks so we can continue to
provide the community with health and fitness for everyone, re-equip our

I have
begun to build a loyal clientele with the surrounding community.   Our
neighbourhood has responded well to Tipo Fitness being here and hopes that we
continue to provide our services.  However, as with any new business,
there have been a few setbacks:
1)  In the early days of Tipo Fitness
I was met with resistance and expense from the city and contractors.  On
several occasions we suffered fines and closure due to contractors not having
proper building permits.  Adding to this,
the City of Vancouver took almost a year to issue the proper business licence,

2) 
Tipofit
was recently the victim of a break in.   As a result we lost lots of

 Because we are a start up company it is not financially possible to

<p>_______________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ENGLISH</p>
<p><b>Sing Lobna, sing ..</b></p>
<p><i>”From
thoughts to words”</i> – it´s not always easy!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Who?</b></p>
<p>Lobna Allamii is 34 years old, turkish-palestinian, born
in Jordan, moved to Turkey at the age of 14 and then to Berlin at age 34, where
she just started her new existence with new job, new house, new life.</p>
<p>She graduated as philosopher and took a master in
”human resource development in education” from Middle East Technical University
(METU) in Ankara/Turkey, where she had spent almost 15 years of her life. She
can speak Turkish, Arabic and English fluently and was just started to learn German.</p>
<p>The last 3 years Lobna had worked in the music business
as manager, booker and agent. In connection to her jobs, she had travelled a
lot in Europe and Middle East, and had also been in Brazil and Thailand.</p>
<p>3 words that will describe Lobna in some extent are
joy, socialization and wisdom. Most of the time she has a smile on her lips and
the southern temper is not lacking at all. She loves to travel, meet new people
and never stands back when it comes to debating about any issue. As mentioned
before she is a philosopher, so it´s not strange that Lobna has an opinion
about everything.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What?</b></p>
<p>The 31 of May 2013 around 1.30 pm (local time in
Turkey), Lobna got a gas canister on her head, that the police fired, as she
was sitting and listening to a speech about Gezi Park at the Taksim square in
Istanbul. It was not more than 5 days ago Lobna arrived to the city from her
new home in Berlin. She was in Istanbul on vacation and to see her family and
friends. Lobna was in the park the days up to May 31th for the sake of the
trees and to be one of the many voices that wanted to save the park from
demolition. Lobna had just brought good intentions with her when she attend the
peaceful demonstrations, she just wanted to show her support to the city she
lived in for 6 years and save one of the few green areas in the heart of the
city. She got rewarded with a teargas bomb!</p>
<p>Lobna is now diagnosed with Conduction Aphasia
Syndrome and has lost strength on the whole right part of her body, as the gas canister
damaged the left brain hemisphere, that controls all the movements on the right
part of our body.</p>
<p>She had two brain surgeries during the first two days.
First one on the left hemisphere, as she got the gas canister on the left side
of her head and second one on right brain hemisphere, as a so-called contrecoup
effect caused a bleeding on right side. The doctors took out a part of her
skull on the left side in the first surgery to relieve the pressure on the
brain and now one more surgery is waiting her, where this part will be put on
place. We still don´t know the date for this surgery, but the doctors are
counting on that Lobna´s condition will reach a stabile point within the next 3
months, so the surgery can be done without any risk.</p>
<p><u><br/></u></p>
<p><u>Short about conduction aphasia</u>: This
aphasia is a result of damages in the connections between our brains two speech
centres – Wernicke, centre for speech comprehension and Brocca, centre for
speech production. Practically it means for Lobna, that she understands what
she hears, but has difficulties when it comes to express herself both orally
and written. In Wernicke she is able to ”form the picture” of what she wants to
say, but since there are damages on the connections the signals doesn´t reach
Brocca efficiently and we therefore experiencing, that she is saying something
else than what she actually intents to. It often gets a game of guessing even
when she talks with her nearest. At the same time she is aware in the very
moment she use words or sentences she actually don´t want to say and most of
the time this awareness about lack of control makes her frustrated and she simply
give up and don´t want to talk.</p>
<p>The doctors expect, that it´s going
to take long time and a lot of retraining before she will get to a level, where
she can communicate efficiently with others. For sure 1 year and it may be several
years before she can reach her old level. It´s a slow process you actually don´t
know where ends. She is going to practice her language and writing every day
and transform other brain cells (neurons) to carry the task to connect Wernicke
to Brocca, instead of the dead cells. When brain cells die, new cells will not be
created, we just have the cells we got in birth, but other brain cells can be coded
to take over the dead cells tasks with retraining.</p>
<p><u><br/></u></p>
<p><u>Short about the weakening on right side</u>: It´s
by now general knowledge, that the right part of the brain is controlling the
left part and the left part of the brain controls the right part of the body.
Lobna got the canister on the left side of her head, with the result that the
right part of her body was paralyzed when she was in intensive care unit. The
doctors were afraid of chronical paralysation, but the last days in intensive
care unit a bit of function appeared on her right leg. This sign of function
was good news, as it could mean that she would eventually be able to move and
use the right side of her body, even that to begin with there was just a little
movement on her leg and none on her arm.<br/></p>
<p>Today Lobna can walk without
help from anybody, but her right arm is still weak. She can move her arm but do
not even have strength enough to hold a pen. It gives her difficulties in her
daily routine and a lot of frustrations, because even to get dressed or use a
spoon, fork or a knife is a battle for her.</p>
<p>A long retraining to strengthen
the right arm and the rest of her body is waiting Lobna, so she can be able to
handle the daily tasks. The retraining will be in form of physiotherapy and strength
training.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>”From thoughts to words” – it´s not always easy!</p>
<p>It´s difficult for Lobna, more than we can imagine. The
result of this aphasia is not just the fact, that she has difficulties when it
comes to speaking, but at the same time a psychological wall, which she runs
into every single day. It´s not easy for her to explain herself, most of the
time impossible and this eats away her energy psychologically. It´s a struggle
and doesn´t get easier with the weakness on her right side, that make it hard
and sometime impossible to do basic daily things. We hope that this period will
be shorter than excepted, but it seems like Lobna is going to undergo a long
retraining in form of physiotherapy, psychotherapy and of course speech
therapy. She won´t be able to work for sure the next year.</p>
<p>What Lobna needs beside a huge amount of patience and
good mood is financial support, so she can handle life. She will have expenses
for everything from rent, food and medicine to therapy expenses, transport and phone/internet.
Until now she got support from her family and close friends, but now after 4 months of which the first one was in intensive care unit, the second in the bed
unit of the hospital, where she got heavy medical treatment and the last two at
her sisters home, where her family took care of her, she needs long term financial
support for her treatment and retraining respectively in Istanbul and Berlin. She
is going to be in Istanbul for a while, because the doctors who operated her
twice previously will make the final surgery to put the skull back on place. After

<p><i>”Düşüncelerden

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Kim?</b></p>
<p>Lobna Allamii 34 yaşında, Ürdün doğumlu, Filistin kökenli
Türk vatandaşı. 14 yaşında Türkiye ye yerleşti ve yine 6 ay önce Berlin de yeni
bulduğu iş ve ev ile, yeni bir hayata başlamak için adım attı.</p>
<p>Yaklaşık 15 senesini geçirdiği Ankara´nın Orta Doğu
Teknik Üniversitesinden (ODTÜ) felsefe mezunu ve yine aynı üniversitede yüksek lisansını
”eğitimde insan kaynaklarını geliştirme” üzerine yaptı. Yüksek seviyede Türkçe,
Arapça ve İngilizce konuşan Lobna daha yeni Almanca öğrenmeye başlamıştı.</p>
<p>Lobna son 3 yıldır müzik piyasasında menajer, booker ve
agent olarak çalışıyor. İş gereği Avrupa’nın ve Orta Doğunun bir çok ülkesine
giden Lobna ayrıca Brezilya ve Tayland´a da bir süre bulundu.</p>
<p>Lobna eşittir hayat sevinci, sosyalleşme ve bilgi. Çoğu
zaman tebessümle dolaşır ve güneyin mizacı ondan asla eksik olmaz. Gezmeyi,
yeni insanlarla tanışmayı ve her kiminle ne hakkında olursa olsun hiçbir tartışmayı
kaçırmayan Lobna daha önce de yazdığımız gibi filozofun ta kendisidir.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Ne oldu?</b></p>
<p>31 Mayıs 2013 Türkiye Saati 13.30 civarlarında, İstanbul
Taksim meydanında Gezi Parkıyla ilgili bir konuşmayı dinlerken Lobna´nın başına
polisin attığı gaz kapsülü isabet etti. Berlin den yeni gelmişti ve İstanbul’da
henüz 5nci günüydü. Lobna tatil yapmak ve aile ve arkadaşlarını görmek için
Türkiye ye gelmişti. Yaralandığı günün öncesinde Lobna ağaçlar için bir kaç kez
parka gitmiş ve oradaki topluluğun içinde seslerden biri olup parkı yıkımdan
kurtarmak istiyordu. Lobna sadece güzel ve iyi niyetlerle 31 Mayıs gününe kadar
daha henüz 100-150 kişiyi geçmeyen bir topluluk içinde bulunup, barışçıl bir şekilde
yürüyen gösterilere katıldı. Lobna´nın sağ duyusuyla katıldığı bu gösterilerde amacı
6 yıldır yaşadığı şehrin kalbindeki son yeşil alanlardan birini kurtarmaktı.
Ödülü başına isabet eden bir gaz kapsülü oldu.</p>
<p>Gaz kapsülü Lobna´nın kafasının sol tarafına isabet ettiği için, sağ
tarafında güç kaybı (felç) ve iletim afazisi sendromu teşhisi hastanede yattığı
süre içinde kondu.</p>
<p>Hastanede yattığı ilk 2 günde 2 kez beyin ameliyatı geçirdi.
İlk ameliyat, darbeyi sol tarafına aldığı için, beynin sol tarafına yapıldı ve
ikinci ameliyat sol tarafa aldığı darbe den dolayı tıp dilinde “contrecoup”
olarak bahsedilen efektten dolayı sağ tarafında oluşan kanamaya müdahale etmek
amacı ile yapıldı. İlk ameliyatta kafatasının sol tarafından, beyin üzerindeki basıncı
azaltmak için bir parça kemik alındı ve şimdi Lobna´yı bu parçanın yerine takılacağı
bir ameliyat daha bekliyor. Henüz bu ameliyat için tarih verilmedi ama
doktorlar Lobna´nın durumunun en fazla 3 ay içinde istenilen stabilizeye ulaşacağını
öngörüp, bu süreci bekleyip ameliyatın risksiz bir şekilde yapılacağını
söylüyorlar.</p>
<p><u><span><br/></span></u></p>
<p><u><span>İletim
afazi sendromu hakkında kısa bilgiler</span></u>: Bu afazi (konuşma
bozukluğu) beynin iki konuşma merkezi arasındaki bağlantıların zarar görmesiyle
oluşan bir konuşma bozukluğudur – konuşma kavrayış merkezi veya bellek diye adlandırabileceğimiz
“Wernicke” ve konuşma üretim merkezi diye adlandırabileceğimiz “Brocca” arasındaki
kopukluktan dolayı görülen bir konuşma bozukluğudur. Bu afazi sendromu Lobna´nın
günlük hayatını bir çok açıdan etkiliyor, zira duyduğunu anlıyor ama hem sözlü
hem yazılı olarak kendini ifade etmeye çalışınca çok zorlanıyor. Wernicke merkezinde
söylemek istediği şeyi aklına getirebiliyor ama bağlantılarda kopukluk olduğu
için sinyalleri ulaştıramıyor, yani aklına getirdiği sözcükleri konuşma üretim
(Brocca) merkezine ulaştıramadığı için asıl söylemek istediği şeylerin dışında,
başka şeyler söylediğini görüyoruz. Diyaloglar en yakınlarıyla bile çoğu zaman
tahmin oyununa dönüşüyor. Lobna kendi konuşma bozukluğunun ve ağızından çıkan
kelimelerin aslında istediği kelimeler olmadığının gayet farkında ve bundan dolayı
çoğu zaman susuyor, içine kapanıyor, konuşmamayı tercih ediyor, çünkü bu durum
onun moralini bozup, çıkmaza sürüklüyor.</p>
<p>Doktorlar Lobna´nın başkalarıyla
sorunsuz bir şekilde iletişim kurabilmesi için uzun sürecek bir iyileşme
sürecinden geçeceğini öngörüyorlar. Bu sürecin 1 seneyi bulması çok olağan ve
eski seviyesine kavuşması için seneler geçebilir. Açıkçası hangi sonuç doğuracağını
bilmediğimiz uzun, yavaş ve sancılı bir süreç olacağı kesin. Her gün yapılan konuşma, okuma ve yazma
egzersizleri ölen beyin hücrelerinin (nöronlar) yerine başka hücreleri Wernicke
merkeziyle Brocca merkezi arasındaki bağları yeniden oluşturmak için kodlayacak
ve Lobna yeniden eski haline kavuşacak. Beyin hücreleri ölünce
yerine yenileri gelmiyor, doğumla gelen beyin hücreleri dışında beyinde yeni
hücreler oluşmuyor, dolayısıyla tedavi, terapi ve egzersizlerle mevcut olan
hücreler ölen hücrelerin yerini doldurmak ve görevlerini üstlenmek için kodlanırlar.</p>
<p><u><span><br/></span></u></p>
<p><u><span>Sağ
taraftaki güç kaybı hakkında kısa bilgiler</span></u>: Beynimizin
sağ tarafı vücudumuzun sol tarafını, beynimizin sol tarafı da vücudumuzun sağ tarafını
kontrol ettiği artık bir çok kişi tarafından bilinen genel bir bilgi. Lobna sol
tarafından darbe aldığı için vücudunun sağ tarafı yoğun bakım ünitesinde
yatarken tamamen felçti. Doktorlar uzun süre bu felcin kalıcı olmasından endişe
duydular ama yoğun bakımdaki sürenin sonlarına doğru Lobna´nın sağ bacağının
hareket ettiği tespit edildi. Bu doktorlar tarafından pozitif bir gelişme
olarak değerlendirildi ve bizlere en ufak fonksiyon belirtisinde bile fizik
tedavi ile çok yol kat edilebileceğini söylediler – çok ama hakikaten çok
sevindik.</p>
<p>Lobna bugün kendi başına yürüyor
ama sağ kolunu hareket ettirmesine rağmen çok güçsüz, kalem tutmakta bile zorlanıyor.
Günlük hayatında bu durum onu çok zorluyor ve bir o kadar da üzüyor, çünkü kıyafet
giyip çıkarmak yada kaşık, çatal veya bıçak kullanmak gibi düşünmeden yaptığımız
temel günlük hareketler onun için neredeyse imkânsız hale geliyor.</p>
<p>Lobna´yı, vücudunun sağ tarafını güçlendirip
günlük hayatındaki temel hareketleri yapabilmesi için zor ve uzun bir iyileşme süreci
bekliyor. İyileşme sürecinde Lobna´ya yoğun bir şekilde fizik tedavi uygulanacak
ve daha ilerde kuvvet çalışmalarına da başlayacak.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Neden?</b></p>
<p>”Düşüncelerden kelimelere” – her zaman kolay değil!</p>
<p>Lobna´nın durumu görünenden ve sandığımızdan daha da zor.
Bu afazinin sonucu sadece konuşma bozukluğu değil, aynı zamanda her gün yine ve
yine içine düştüğü psikolojik bir çıkmaz. Kendisini ifade etmekte çok zorlanıyor,
çoğu zaman imkânsız bir hal alıyor ve bunun sonucunda psikolojik olarak çok sarsılıyor.
Lobna için hâlihazırda çok zor bir savaş ve sağ tarafındaki güç kaybı, günlük
temel ihtiyaçlarını karşılamasında zor anlar yaşatarak bu durumu daha da ağırlaştırıyor.
Lobna ve yakınları bu zorlu sürecin mümkün olduğunca kısa olmasını ümit ediyor
ama öyle görünüyor ki Lobna uzun süre fizik-, psiko-, ve konuşma terapisi
görecek, dolayısıyla önümüzdeki 1 sene boyunca çalışamayacak.</p>

Sabır ve moral dışında Lobna´nın şu an ve ilerisi için
ihtiyacı olan şey maddi destek. Günlük yaşamsal ihtiyaçlar ve ilaç giderlerinden
başlayarak terapi, tedavi, üçüncü ameliyat masrafları, ulaşım ve telefon/internet gibi giderleri karşılaması için
desteğe ihtiyacı var. Lobna şu ana kadar ailesinin ve yakın arkadaşlarının yardımıyla
geçindi. Olayın üzerinden 4 ay geçti, bunun ilk ayı yoğun bakım ünitesinde,
ikinci ayı ağır ilaç tedavisi gördüğü hastanenin servis bölümünde ve son aylarda ise ailesi tarafından bakımı sağlanan Lobna´nin bundan sonra
çalışamayacağı öngörülen uzun bir süreçte ve İstanbul ile Berlin arası
tedavilerini sürdürebilmesi için maddi desteğe ihtiyacı var. Lobna bir süre daha Türkiye’de kalacak, çünkü kafatası
kemiğinin takılacağı ameliyatı İstanbul’da ilk iki ameliyatı yapan doktorlar
yapacaklar. Bu ameliyattan sonra ise en gelişmiş fizik tedavi ve
konuşma terapi uygulamaların bulunduğu Almanya´ya gidip tedavilerini sürdürmeyi
planlamaktadır.<br/><p></p>

<p><b>Syng Lobna, syng ..</b></p>
<p><i>”Fra tanker til ord”</i> – det er ikke altid
lige nemt!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Hvem?</b></p>
<p>Lobna
Allamii er 34 år, tyrkisk-palæstinenser, født i Jordan, flyttede til Tyrkiet
som 14-årig og videre til Berlin som 34-årig, hvor hun lige var begyndt hendes
nye tilværelse med nyt job, ny bolig, nyt liv.</p>
<p>Hun
er uddannet filosof med kandidat i ”human ressource development in education”
fra Middle East Technical University (METU) i Ankara/Tyrkiet, hvor hun også har
tilbragt næsten 15 år af hendes liv. Hun kan flydende tyrkisk, arabisk og
engelsk og var lige begyndt med at lære tysk.</p>
<p>De
sidste 3 år har Lobna arbejdet i musikbranchen, som manager, booker og agent.
Ifm. hendes jobs har hun rejst meget i Europa og i Mellemøsten, og har også
været i Brasilien og Thailand.</p>
<p>Lobna
er lig med livsglæde, socialisering og visdom. Hun har for det meste et smil på
læben og det sydlige temperament mangler ikke. Hun elsker at rejse, møde nye
mennesker og står aldrig tilbage når det gælder om at debattere omkring et
hvilket som helst emne. Som før nævnt er hun filosof, så det er ikke mærkeligt,
at Lobna har en mening om alt og alle.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Hvad?</b></p>
<p>D.
31. Maj 2013 omkring klokken 13.30 (tyrkisk tid), fik Lobna en tåregasbombe i
hovedet, som politiet affyrede, da hun sad og lyttede til en tale der omhandlede
Gezi Parken på Taksim torvet i Istanbul. Det var ikke mere end 5 dage siden hun
kom til byen fra hendes nye hjem i Berlin. Hun var i Istanbul på ferie og for
at se hendes venner og familie. Dagene op til var Lobna i parken for træernes
skyld og for at være én blandt de mange stemmer der ville redde parken fra
nedrivning. Lobna bragte kun gode intentioner med sig, da hun deltog i de
fredelige demonstrationer, hun ville blot vise sin støtte til den by hun havde
boet i de sidste 6 år og redde én af de få grønne arealer i byens hjerte. Hun
blev belønnet med en tåregasbombe!</p>
<p>Det
er konstateret, at Lobna har konduktion afasi syndromet og er svækket i hele
hendes højre side, da tåregasbomben har skadet hendes venstre hjernehalvdel,
som netop styrer alle vores bevægelser på højre side.</p>
<p>Hun
blev opereret 2 gange i løbet af de første 2 dage. Første gang i venstre
hjernehalvdel, da tåregasbomben ramte hende på venstre side og anden gang i
højre hjernehalvdel, da en såkaldt contrecoup effekt forårsagede en blødning i
højre side. Et stykke af hendes kranie på venstre side blev taget ud ved første
operation for at lette trykket på hjernen og der venter hende nu en operation
mere, hvor dette stykke skal sættes på plads. Der er endnu ikke sat dato på
operationen, men lægerne regner med at Lobnas tilstand når den forventede
stabilitet i løbet af de næste 3 måneder, så operationen kan udføres uden nogen
risiko.</p>
<p><u><span><br/></span></u></p>
<p><u><span>Kort om konduktion afasi
syndromet</span></u>:
Denne afasi opstår ved at man får skadet forbindelserne/ledningerne mellem hjernens
to talecentre – Wernicke, som er centret for taleforståelse og Brocca, som er centret
for taleproduktion. Rent praktisk betyder det for Lobna, at hun forstår hvad hun
hører, men har store vanskeligheder når hun selv skal udtrykke sig både
mundtligt og skriftligt. I Wernicke centret kan hun godt ”danne billedet” af
det hun vil sige, men da der er skader på forbindelserne når disse signaler
ikke centret for taleproduktion (Brocca) og vi oplever derfor, at hun siger noget
andet end hvad der er hendes intention. Det bliver tit en gætteleg, selv når
hun snakker med hendes nærmeste. På samme tid er hun godt klar over, at det der
kommer ud af hendes mund ikke er det hun ville sige og denne bevidsthed gør
tit, at hun helt opgiver at tale, da hun let bliver frustreret over, at hun
ikke kan sige de ting hun har i tankerne. </p>
<p>Lægerne forventer, at det kommer til at tage lang tid og
meget genoptræning før hun når et niveau, hvor hun kan kommunikere med andre
uden problemer. I hvert fald 1 år og der kan gå flere år, før hun når sit gamle
niveau. Det er et langsommeligt proces man egentlig ikke ved hvor ender. Hun
skal træne sit sprog og skrift hver dag og på den måde omdanne andre hjerneceller
(neuroner) til at varetage opgaven om at forbinde Wernicke centret til Brocca
centret, i stedet for de døde celler. Når hjerneceller dør, kommer der ikke nye
til, vi har kun dem vi har fået ved fødslen, men andre hjerneceller kan blive
kodet til at overtage de døde cellers opgaver med genoptræning.</p>
<p><u><span><br/></span></u></p>
<p><u><span>Kort om svækkelsen på
højre side</span></u>:
Det er efterhånden almen viden, at højre side af hjernen styrer venstre side af
kroppen og venstre side af hjernen styrer højre side af kroppen. Lobna blev
ramt på venstre side, hvilket har resulteret i, at hele højre side af kroppen
var lammet da hun var på intensiv afdeling. Lægerne var bange for, at hun ville
forblive lam, men den sidste tid på intensiv afdeling begyndte der at vise sig
en smule funktion på højre ben. Vi fik at vide, at det var en positiv udvikling,
da det kunne betyde, at hun efterhånden ville kunne bevæge højre side af
kroppen, selvom der til at begynde med ikke var liv i hendes arm og kun lidt på
benet.</p>
<p>I dag er Lobna på benene og kan gå uden andres hjælp,
dog er hendes højre arm fortsat meget svækket. Hun kan bevæge den, men har ikke
engang styrke nok til at holde en blyant. Det giver hende store vanskeligheder i
hverdagen og frustrationerne følger med, da selv det at tage tøjet af og på
eller bruge en ske, gaffel eller kniv er en kamp for hende.</p>
<p>Der venter Lobna en hård og lang genoptræning ift. at få
styrket hendes arm og resten af kroppen, så hun kan klare de daglige opgaver. Genoptræningen
bliver i form af fysioterapi og styrketræning. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Hvorfor?</b></p>
<p>”Fra
tanker til ord” – det er ikke altid lige nemt!</p>
<p>Lobna
har det sværere end vi kan forestille os. Resultatet af denne afasi er ikke kun
det faktum, at hun har talebesvær, men det er samtidig en psykisk mur, som hun
støder ind i hver evig eneste dag. Det er ikke nemt for hende at formulere sig
korrekt, for det meste helt umuligt og dette tærer på hendes kræfter rent
psykisk. Det er en hård kamp og det bliver ikke nemmere af, at hendes svækkelse
på højre side gøre det svært, nogen gange forhindrer hende i at udføre mange
basale ting i dagligdagen. Vi håber denne tid bliver kortere end forventet, men
det ser ud til, at der venter Lobna en længere genoptræningen i form af
fysioterapi, psykoterapi og ikke mindst taleterapi. Hun vil ikke være i stand
til at arbejde det næste års tid.</p>
<p>Hvad
Lobna har brug for udover en pæn portion tålmodighed og godt humør er økonomisk
støtte, så hun kan klare tilværelsen. Hun kommer til at have udgifter til alt
lige fra leje, mad og medicin, til terapi omkostninger, transport og
telefon/internet. Indtil videre har hun klaret sig med familiens og hendes nære
venners hjælp, men nu efter 4 måneder hvoraf den første var på intensiv
afdeling, den anden i hospitalets sengeafdeling, hvor hun fik tung medicinsk
behandling og de sidste to hjemme hos hendes søster, hvor hendes familie tog sig
af hende, er der nu brug for en længerevarende finansiel støtte til resten af
hendes behandling og genoptræning i henholdsvis Istanbul og Berlin. Hun kommer
til at være i Istanbul det næste stykke tid, da operationen, hvor kraniet skal
sættes på plads, skal laves af de samme læger der opererede hende de to første
gange. Derefter går turen videre til hendes nye hjem i Berlin, hvor hendes
genoptræning skal fortsætte.</p>
<br/><p></p>

Interview with Lobna´s sister (turkish)

ENGLISH
Sing Lobna, sing ..
”From
thoughts to words” – it´s not always easy!

Who?
Lobna Allamii is 34 years old, turkish-palestinian, born
in Jordan, moved to Turkey at the age of 14 and then to Berlin at age 34, where
she just started her new existence with new job, new house, new life.
She graduated as philosopher and took a master in
”human resource development in education” from Middle East Technical University
(METU) in Ankara/Turkey, where she had spent almost 15 years of her life. She
can speak Turkish, Arabic and English fluently and was just started to learn German.
The last 3 years Lobna had worked in the music business
as manager, booker and agent. In connection to her jobs, she had travelled a
lot in Europe and Middle East, and had also been in Brazil and Thailand.
3 words that will describe Lobna in some extent are
joy, socialization and wisdom. Most of the time she has a smile on her lips and
the southern temper is not lacking at all. She loves to travel, meet new people
and never stands back when it comes to debating about any issue. As mentioned
before she is a philosopher, so it´s not strange that Lobna has an opinion
about everything.

What?
The 31 of May 2013 around 1.30 pm (local time in
Turkey), Lobna got a gas canister on her head, that the police fired, as she
was sitting and listening to a speech about Gezi Park at the Taksim square in
Istanbul. It was not more than 5 days ago Lobna arrived to the city from her
new home in Berlin. She was in Istanbul on vacation and to see her family and
friends. Lobna was in the park the days up to May 31th for the sake of the
trees and to be one of the many voices that wanted to save the park from
demolition. Lobna had just brought good intentions with her when she attend the
peaceful demonstrations, she just wanted to show her support to the city she
lived in for 6 years and save one of the few green areas in the heart of the
city. She got rewarded with a teargas bomb!
Lobna is now diagnosed with Conduction Aphasia
Syndrome and has lost strength on the whole right part of her body, as the gas canister
damaged the left brain hemisphere, that controls all the movements on the right
part of our body.
She had two brain surgeries during the first two days.
First one on the left hemisphere, as she got the gas canister on the left side
of her head and second one on right brain hemisphere, as a so-called contrecoup
effect caused a bleeding on right side. The doctors took out a part of her
skull on the left side in the first surgery to relieve the pressure on the
brain and now one more surgery is waiting her, where this part will be put on
place. We still don´t know the date for this surgery, but the doctors are
counting on that Lobna´s condition will reach a stabile point within the next 3
months, so the surgery can be done without any risk.

Short about conduction aphasia: This
aphasia is a result of damages in the connections between our brains two speech
centres – Wernicke, centre for speech comprehension and Brocca, centre for
speech production. Practically it means for Lobna, that she understands what
she hears, but has difficulties when it comes to express herself both orally
and written. In Wernicke she is able to ”form the picture” of what she wants to
say, but since there are damages on the connections the signals doesn´t reach
Brocca efficiently and we therefore experiencing, that she is saying something
else than what she actually intents to. It often gets a game of guessing even
when she talks with her nearest. At the same time she is aware in the very
moment she use words or sentences she actually don´t want to say and most of
the time this awareness about lack of control makes her frustrated and she simply
give up and don´t want to talk.
The doctors expect, that it´s going
to take long time and a lot of retraining before she will get to a level, where
she can communicate efficiently with others. For sure 1 year and it may be several
years before she can reach her old level. It´s a slow process you actually don´t
know where ends. She is going to practice her language and writing every day
and transform other brain cells (neurons) to carry the task to connect Wernicke
to Brocca, instead of the dead cells. When brain cells die, new cells will not be
created, we just have the cells we got in birth, but other brain cells can be coded
to take over the dead cells tasks with retraining.

Short about the weakening on right side: It´s
by now general knowledge, that the right part of the brain is controlling the
left part and the left part of the brain controls the right part of the body.
Lobna got the canister on the left side of her head, with the result that the
right part of her body was paralyzed when she was in intensive care unit. The
doctors were afraid of chronical paralysation, but the last days in intensive
care unit a bit of function appeared on her right leg. This sign of function
was good news, as it could mean that she would eventually be able to move and
use the right side of her body, even that to begin with there was just a little
movement on her leg and none on her arm.
Today Lobna can walk without
help from anybody, but her right arm is still weak. She can move her arm but do
not even have strength enough to hold a pen. It gives her difficulties in her
daily routine and a lot of frustrations, because even to get dressed or use a
spoon, fork or a knife is a battle for her.
A long retraining to strengthen
the right arm and the rest of her body is waiting Lobna, so she can be able to
handle the daily tasks. The retraining will be in form of physiotherapy and strength
training.

Why?
”From thoughts to words” – it´s not always easy!
It´s difficult for Lobna, more than we can imagine. The
result of this aphasia is not just the fact, that she has difficulties when it
comes to speaking, but at the same time a psychological wall, which she runs
into every single day. It´s not easy for her to explain herself, most of the
time impossible and this eats away her energy psychologically. It´s a struggle
and doesn´t get easier with the weakness on her right side, that make it hard
and sometime impossible to do basic daily things. We hope that this period will
be shorter than excepted, but it seems like Lobna is going to undergo a long
retraining in form of physiotherapy, psychotherapy and of course speech
therapy. She won´t be able to work for sure the next year.
What Lobna needs beside a huge amount of patience and
good mood is financial support, so she can handle life. She will have expenses
for everything from rent, food and medicine to therapy expenses, transport and phone/internet.
Until now she got support from her family and close friends, but now after 4 months of which the first one was in intensive care unit, the second in the bed
unit of the hospital, where she got heavy medical treatment and the last two at
her sisters home, where her family took care of her, she needs long term financial
support for her treatment and retraining respectively in Istanbul and Berlin. She
is going to be in Istanbul for a while, because the doctors who operated her
twice previously will make the final surgery to put the skull back on place. After
this the journey continues to her new home in Berlin, where the retraining will
continue.



NB! Beside mentioned perks Lobna will write thank you messages
on her facebook wall and twitter with names of everybody who supported the campaign!

Gaz kapsülü Lobna´nın kafasının sol tarafına isabet ettiği için, sağ
tarafında güç kaybı (felç) ve iletim afazisi sendromu teşhisi hastanede yattığı
süre içinde kondu.
Hastanede yattığı ilk 2 günde 2 kez beyin ameliyatı geçirdi.
İlk ameliyat, darbeyi sol tarafına aldığı için, beynin sol tarafına yapıldı ve
ikinci ameliyat sol tarafa aldığı darbe den dolayı tıp dilinde “contrecoup”
olarak bahsedilen efektten dolayı sağ tarafında oluşan kanamaya müdahale etmek
amacı ile yapıldı. İlk ameliyatta kafatasının sol tarafından, beyin üzerindeki basıncı
azaltmak için bir parça kemik alındı ve şimdi Lobna´yı bu parçanın yerine takılacağı
bir ameliyat daha bekliyor. Henüz bu ameliyat için tarih verilmedi ama
doktorlar Lobna´nın durumunun en fazla 3 ay içinde istenilen stabilizeye ulaşacağını
öngörüp, bu süreci bekleyip ameliyatın risksiz bir şekilde yapılacağını
söylüyorlar.

İletim
afazi sendromu hakkında kısa bilgiler: Bu afazi (konuşma
bozukluğu) beynin iki konuşma merkezi arasındaki bağlantıların zarar görmesiyle
oluşan bir konuşma bozukluğudur – konuşma kavrayış merkezi veya bellek diye adlandırabileceğimiz
“Wernicke” ve konuşma üretim merkezi diye adlandırabileceğimiz “Brocca” arasındaki
kopukluktan dolayı görülen bir konuşma bozukluğudur. Bu afazi sendromu Lobna´nın
günlük hayatını bir çok açıdan etkiliyor, zira duyduğunu anlıyor ama hem sözlü
hem yazılı olarak kendini ifade etmeye çalışınca çok zorlanıyor. Wernicke merkezinde
söylemek istediği şeyi aklına getirebiliyor ama bağlantılarda kopukluk olduğu
için sinyalleri ulaştıramıyor, yani aklına getirdiği sözcükleri konuşma üretim
(Brocca) merkezine ulaştıramadığı için asıl söylemek istediği şeylerin dışında,
başka şeyler söylediğini görüyoruz. Diyaloglar en yakınlarıyla bile çoğu zaman
tahmin oyununa dönüşüyor. Lobna kendi konuşma bozukluğunun ve ağızından çıkan
kelimelerin aslında istediği kelimeler olmadığının gayet farkında ve bundan dolayı
çoğu zaman susuyor, içine kapanıyor, konuşmamayı tercih ediyor, çünkü bu durum
onun moralini bozup, çıkmaza sürüklüyor.
Doktorlar Lobna´nın başkalarıyla
sorunsuz bir şekilde iletişim kurabilmesi için uzun sürecek bir iyileşme
sürecinden geçeceğini öngörüyorlar. Bu sürecin 1 seneyi bulması çok olağan ve
eski seviyesine kavuşması için seneler geçebilir. Açıkçası hangi sonuç doğuracağını
bilmediğimiz uzun, yavaş ve sancılı bir süreç olacağı kesin. Her gün yapılan konuşma, okuma ve yazma
egzersizleri ölen beyin hücrelerinin (nöronlar) yerine başka hücreleri Wernicke
merkeziyle Brocca merkezi arasındaki bağları yeniden oluşturmak için kodlayacak
ve Lobna yeniden eski haline kavuşacak. Beyin hücreleri ölünce
yerine yenileri gelmiyor, doğumla gelen beyin hücreleri dışında beyinde yeni
hücreler oluşmuyor, dolayısıyla tedavi, terapi ve egzersizlerle mevcut olan
hücreler ölen hücrelerin yerini doldurmak ve görevlerini üstlenmek için kodlanırlar.

Sağ
taraftaki güç kaybı hakkında kısa bilgiler: Beynimizin
sağ tarafı vücudumuzun sol tarafını, beynimizin sol tarafı da vücudumuzun sağ tarafını
kontrol ettiği artık bir çok kişi tarafından bilinen genel bir bilgi. Lobna sol
tarafından darbe aldığı için vücudunun sağ tarafı yoğun bakım ünitesinde
yatarken tamamen felçti. Doktorlar uzun süre bu felcin kalıcı olmasından endişe
duydular ama yoğun bakımdaki sürenin sonlarına doğru Lobna´nın sağ bacağının
hareket ettiği tespit edildi. Bu doktorlar tarafından pozitif bir gelişme
olarak değerlendirildi ve bizlere en ufak fonksiyon belirtisinde bile fizik
tedavi ile çok yol kat edilebileceğini söylediler – çok ama hakikaten çok
sevindik.
Lobna bugün kendi başına yürüyor
ama sağ kolunu hareket ettirmesine rağmen çok güçsüz, kalem tutmakta bile zorlanıyor.
Günlük hayatında bu durum onu çok zorluyor ve bir o kadar da üzüyor, çünkü kıyafet
giyip çıkarmak yada kaşık, çatal veya bıçak kullanmak gibi düşünmeden yaptığımız
temel günlük hareketler onun için neredeyse imkânsız hale geliyor.
Lobna´yı, vücudunun sağ tarafını güçlendirip
günlük hayatındaki temel hareketleri yapabilmesi için zor ve uzun bir iyileşme süreci
bekliyor. İyileşme sürecinde Lobna´ya yoğun bir şekilde fizik tedavi uygulanacak
ve daha ilerde kuvvet çalışmalarına da başlayacak.

Neden?
”Düşüncelerden kelimelere” – her zaman kolay değil!
Lobna´nın durumu görünenden ve sandığımızdan daha da zor.
Bu afazinin sonucu sadece konuşma bozukluğu değil, aynı zamanda her gün yine ve
yine içine düştüğü psikolojik bir çıkmaz. Kendisini ifade etmekte çok zorlanıyor,
çoğu zaman imkânsız bir hal alıyor ve bunun sonucunda psikolojik olarak çok sarsılıyor.
Lobna için hâlihazırda çok zor bir savaş ve sağ tarafındaki güç kaybı, günlük
temel ihtiyaçlarını karşılamasında zor anlar yaşatarak bu durumu daha da ağırlaştırıyor.
Lobna ve yakınları bu zorlu sürecin mümkün olduğunca kısa olmasını ümit ediyor
ama öyle görünüyor ki Lobna uzun süre fizik-, psiko-, ve konuşma terapisi
görecek, dolayısıyla önümüzdeki 1 sene boyunca çalışamayacak.

Sabır ve moral dışında Lobna´nın şu an ve ilerisi için
ihtiyacı olan şey maddi destek. Günlük yaşamsal ihtiyaçlar ve ilaç giderlerinden
başlayarak terapi, tedavi, üçüncü ameliyat masrafları, ulaşım ve telefon/internet gibi giderleri karşılaması için
desteğe ihtiyacı var. Lobna şu ana kadar ailesinin ve yakın arkadaşlarının yardımıyla
geçindi. Olayın üzerinden 4 ay geçti, bunun ilk ayı yoğun bakım ünitesinde,
ikinci ayı ağır ilaç tedavisi gördüğü hastanenin servis bölümünde ve son aylarda ise ailesi tarafından bakımı sağlanan Lobna´nin bundan sonra
çalışamayacağı öngörülen uzun bir süreçte ve İstanbul ile Berlin arası
tedavilerini sürdürebilmesi için maddi desteğe ihtiyacı var. Lobna bir süre daha Türkiye’de kalacak, çünkü kafatası
kemiğinin takılacağı ameliyatı İstanbul’da ilk iki ameliyatı yapan doktorlar
yapacaklar. Bu ameliyattan sonra ise en gelişmiş fizik tedavi ve
konuşma terapi uygulamaların bulunduğu Almanya´ya gidip tedavilerini sürdürmeyi
planlamaktadır.



NB! Belirtilen perks ler (katkı ödülleri) dışında Lobna facebook duvarına ve twitter a bu
kampanya ya destek olan herkesin adının geçtiği teşekkür mesajları yazacak!

Syng Lobna, syng ..
”Fra tanker til ord” – det er ikke altid
lige nemt!

Hvem?
Lobna
Allamii er 34 år, tyrkisk-palæstinenser, født i Jordan, flyttede til Tyrkiet
som 14-årig og videre til Berlin som 34-årig, hvor hun lige var begyndt hendes
nye tilværelse med nyt job, ny bolig, nyt liv.
Hun
er uddannet filosof med kandidat i ”human ressource development in education”
fra Middle East Technical University (METU) i Ankara/Tyrkiet, hvor hun også har
tilbragt næsten 15 år af hendes liv. Hun kan flydende tyrkisk, arabisk og
engelsk og var lige begyndt med at lære tysk.
De
sidste 3 år har Lobna arbejdet i musikbranchen, som manager, booker og agent.
Ifm. hendes jobs har hun rejst meget i Europa og i Mellemøsten, og har også
været i Brasilien og Thailand.
Lobna
er lig med livsglæde, socialisering og visdom. Hun har for det meste et smil på
læben og det sydlige temperament mangler ikke. Hun elsker at rejse, møde nye
mennesker og står aldrig tilbage når det gælder om at debattere omkring et
hvilket som helst emne. Som før nævnt er hun filosof, så det er ikke mærkeligt,
at Lobna har en mening om alt og alle.

Hvad?
D.
31. Maj 2013 omkring klokken 13.30 (tyrkisk tid), fik Lobna en tåregasbombe i
hovedet, som politiet affyrede, da hun sad og lyttede til en tale der omhandlede
Gezi Parken på Taksim torvet i Istanbul. Det var ikke mere end 5 dage siden hun
kom til byen fra hendes nye hjem i Berlin. Hun var i Istanbul på ferie og for
at se hendes venner og familie. Dagene op til var Lobna i parken for træernes
skyld og for at være én blandt de mange stemmer der ville redde parken fra
nedrivning. Lobna bragte kun gode intentioner med sig, da hun deltog i de
fredelige demonstrationer, hun ville blot vise sin støtte til den by hun havde
boet i de sidste 6 år og redde én af de få grønne arealer i byens hjerte. Hun
blev belønnet med en tåregasbombe!
Det
er konstateret, at Lobna har konduktion afasi syndromet og er svækket i hele
hendes højre side, da tåregasbomben har skadet hendes venstre hjernehalvdel,
som netop styrer alle vores bevægelser på højre side.
Hun
blev opereret 2 gange i løbet af de første 2 dage. Første gang i venstre
hjernehalvdel, da tåregasbomben ramte hende på venstre side og anden gang i
højre hjernehalvdel, da en såkaldt contrecoup effekt forårsagede en blødning i
højre side. Et stykke af hendes kranie på venstre side blev taget ud ved første
operation for at lette trykket på hjernen og der venter hende nu en operation
mere, hvor dette stykke skal sættes på plads. Der er endnu ikke sat dato på
operationen, men lægerne regner med at Lobnas tilstand når den forventede
stabilitet i løbet af de næste 3 måneder, så operationen kan udføres uden nogen
risiko.

Kort om konduktion afasi
syndromet:
Denne afasi opstår ved at man får skadet forbindelserne/ledningerne mellem hjernens
to talecentre – Wernicke, som er centret for taleforståelse og Brocca, som er centret
for taleproduktion. Rent praktisk betyder det for Lobna, at hun forstår hvad hun
hører, men har store vanskeligheder når hun selv skal udtrykke sig både
mundtligt og skriftligt. I Wernicke centret kan hun godt ”danne billedet” af
det hun vil sige, men da der er skader på forbindelserne når disse signaler
ikke centret for taleproduktion (Brocca) og vi oplever derfor, at hun siger noget
andet end hvad der er hendes intention. Det bliver tit en gætteleg, selv når
hun snakker med hendes nærmeste. På samme tid er hun godt klar over, at det der
kommer ud af hendes mund ikke er det hun ville sige og denne bevidsthed gør
tit, at hun helt opgiver at tale, da hun let bliver frustreret over, at hun
ikke kan sige de ting hun har i tankerne. 
Lægerne forventer, at det kommer til at tage lang tid og
meget genoptræning før hun når et niveau, hvor hun kan kommunikere med andre
uden problemer. I hvert fald 1 år og der kan gå flere år, før hun når sit gamle
niveau. Det er et langsommeligt proces man egentlig ikke ved hvor ender. Hun
skal træne sit sprog og skrift hver dag og på den måde omdanne andre hjerneceller
(neuroner) til at varetage opgaven om at forbinde Wernicke centret til Brocca
centret, i stedet for de døde celler. Når hjerneceller dør, kommer der ikke nye
til, vi har kun dem vi har fået ved fødslen, men andre hjerneceller kan blive
kodet til at overtage de døde cellers opgaver med genoptræning.

Kort om svækkelsen på
højre side:
Det er efterhånden almen viden, at højre side af hjernen styrer venstre side af
kroppen og venstre side af hjernen styrer højre side af kroppen. Lobna blev
ramt på venstre side, hvilket har resulteret i, at hele højre side af kroppen
var lammet da hun var på intensiv afdeling. Lægerne var bange for, at hun ville
forblive lam, men den sidste tid på intensiv afdeling begyndte der at vise sig
en smule funktion på højre ben. Vi fik at vide, at det var en positiv udvikling,
da det kunne betyde, at hun efterhånden ville kunne bevæge højre side af
kroppen, selvom der til at begynde med ikke var liv i hendes arm og kun lidt på
benet.
I dag er Lobna på benene og kan gå uden andres hjælp,
dog er hendes højre arm fortsat meget svækket. Hun kan bevæge den, men har ikke
engang styrke nok til at holde en blyant. Det giver hende store vanskeligheder i
hverdagen og frustrationerne følger med, da selv det at tage tøjet af og på
eller bruge en ske, gaffel eller kniv er en kamp for hende.
Der venter Lobna en hård og lang genoptræning ift. at få
styrket hendes arm og resten af kroppen, så hun kan klare de daglige opgaver. Genoptræningen
bliver i form af fysioterapi og styrketræning. 

Hvorfor?
”Fra
tanker til ord” – det er ikke altid lige nemt!
Lobna
har det sværere end vi kan forestille os. Resultatet af denne afasi er ikke kun
det faktum, at hun har talebesvær, men det er samtidig en psykisk mur, som hun
støder ind i hver evig eneste dag. Det er ikke nemt for hende at formulere sig
korrekt, for det meste helt umuligt og dette tærer på hendes kræfter rent
psykisk. Det er en hård kamp og det bliver ikke nemmere af, at hendes svækkelse
på højre side gøre det svært, nogen gange forhindrer hende i at udføre mange
basale ting i dagligdagen. Vi håber denne tid bliver kortere end forventet, men
det ser ud til, at der venter Lobna en længere genoptræningen i form af
fysioterapi, psykoterapi og ikke mindst taleterapi. Hun vil ikke være i stand
til at arbejde det næste års tid.
Hvad
Lobna har brug for udover en pæn portion tålmodighed og godt humør er økonomisk
støtte, så hun kan klare tilværelsen. Hun kommer til at have udgifter til alt
lige fra leje, mad og medicin, til terapi omkostninger, transport og
telefon/internet. Indtil videre har hun klaret sig med familiens og hendes nære
venners hjælp, men nu efter 4 måneder hvoraf den første var på intensiv
afdeling, den anden i hospitalets sengeafdeling, hvor hun fik tung medicinsk
behandling og de sidste to hjemme hos hendes søster, hvor hendes familie tog sig
af hende, er der nu brug for en længerevarende finansiel støtte til resten af
hendes behandling og genoptræning i henholdsvis Istanbul og Berlin. Hun kommer
til at være i Istanbul det næste stykke tid, da operationen, hvor kraniet skal
sættes på plads, skal laves af de samme læger der opererede hende de to første
gange. Derefter går turen videre til hendes nye hjem i Berlin, hvor hendes
genoptræning skal fortsætte.

By offering affordable sliding scale prices and showing up where we're needed most, we hope to to be available to serve a whole community that is currently underserved by acupuncturists in the Boulder-Denver region. We were looking for a fun and interesting way to express our belief in social justice and equality- now we’re driving the healthcare (r)evolution. There are plenty of food trucks out there, but what about the other kinds of nourishment our bodies and spirits need - we're here to deliver.Next stop - balanceThe bus will be highly visible at a number of locations in the community, generating curiosity and awareness about the efficacy, flexibility, ease, and value of acupuncture as a healing option that utilizes the body's innate capacities to heal itself. With the work of our design team, walking into the bus will be like walking into a warm and welcoming home, so it will be both a clean and safe environment where medical treatment can be accessed and a place where one can feel relaxed and comfortable. As always the acupuncture treatments will be tailored specifically for what the patient needs whether it’s pain, digestive unease, or insomnia. Next stop - healthThis project is a prototype of a model of care that can spread across the country and increase access both in isolated urban and rural areas, similar to the ""Barefoot Doctors"" in 1930's China who were trained to go into towns and villages and bring medicine to those who had little or no access. Eventually, we hope to play a part in transporting healthcare to states and cities from coast to coast.

MY SITUATION

Hi... I'm not good at asking for help. I really, really hate this.

I've been fighting an 11 year battle against chronic Lyme Disease and coinfections, which have left me debilitated and insolvent. My symptoms are many, and include excruciating muscle, joint, and bone pain, cognitive and memory issues, severe headaches, extreme fatigue, difficulty breathing, sleep disorder, depression, and more. I am often unable to fully utilize my left leg, I am regularly in a state of panic, and I am soooo tired.. physically, mentally, and emotionally.

Living in an area where most businesses close in winter, there are few year round jobs, and I am required to change health insurance providers every 5-6 months, with waiting periods in between. My PCP, who won't administer long-term Lyme treatment due to related politics and controversy, doesn't accept my summer/fall insurance. My Lyme specialist, who used to accept my summer/fall and winter/spring insurances, no longer accepts EITHER, nor does ANY other Lyme specialist.

I have recently had to put my health above all other basic needs because the stop-start treatment is quite literally killing me. It was a nasty trade that will result in my electricity being turned off for non payment in mid March when the winter shut-off moratorium ends. I am also faced with the choice of keeping either my apartment or my car, both of which I am now at risk of losing. I will have to keep and live in my car, because I cannot work without it, and without either work or proper medical insurance I'll be as good as dead. I am fortunate that I have a job that does not require me to get out of my car (which I often CAN'T do) or to work when I am feeling too sick. 

The only family I know is my father, who has Alzheimer's and no longer knows me. My friends each have their own problems, and they have all done all that they can for me. I'm on my own.
 



HOW YOU CAN HELP
Even the smallest contribution can help to change my life. 
 
I have paid a deposit toward the filing of a bankruptcy petition, which will relieve me of the financial burden that has resulted from the Lyme Disease, and free me of garnishment issues, but I have no way of paying for the rest of it. Your contribution will help to get the bankruptcy petition filed, which will save my home, electricity, and car, and enable me to pay monthly premiums on decent, private medical insurance. 

Your contribution will will also help to pay for an appointment with my Lyme specialist, which should carry me through until my new insurance is in effect.

If I get the bankruptcy petition filed within 2 weeks, I may win this fight. If not, I will hit rock bottom. It is painful for me to have to present myself as a 'charity,' but I need help. I can't do it alone.

NO CONTRIBUTION IS TOO SMALL, and I will somehow pay each forward.

IndieGoGo accepts all major credit cards. 

THANK YOU!

 you for taking the time to look at this page. This fundraiser is 
dedicated to my good friend Chris.</p><p>
Over the years, Chris was told to try several different treatments and 
drugs like Accutaine and Humaria but they did not work.  He was diagnosed
 officially with Hidradenitis suppurativa in 2011, a disease which is 
fairly common but poorly studied. He is at a stage 4, the highest stage 
of this disease.
Wikipedia states, ""Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a skin disease that 
most commonly affects areas bearing apocrine sweat glands or sebaceous 
glands , such as the underarms, under the breasts, inner thighs, groin 
and buttocks."" When it affects these areas, large inflammation and 
infections happen.
As you can see, it is a pretty uncomfortable condition. So 
uncomfortable, that most daily tasks such as showering or standing for 
long periods of time are painful. Even trips to the grocery store has 
left Chris exhausted.
</p><p><span>After many doctor visits, the conclusion has been made for Chris to 
undergo surgery in 2014. (Chris has confirmed the date of January 2nd.) The surgery itself will be a very simple 
procedure, however, the healing process is estimated 3-4 months.
</span></p><p><span>Chris has left his job and has very little savings.
Having this surgery will help Chris gain back a part of his life he has 
lost due to this disease and help him look forward. </span></p><p><span>To
 ensure a healthy recovery, Chris would like to reach a goal of 2,500 
dollars. The healing process will be very painful &amp; we would love to

 you can't make a donation, please send this page along to your friends.
 Although we would like to see a success with his donation, another big

<p>My name is Jackson Cofer and I live in Lexington, KY. Born in North Carolina and raised in Jupiter, FL I have been a Kentuckian for the past 9 years. More importantly, I have discovered my true self as an activist, advocate and voice for the LGBTIQQA community.</p>
<p>In <strong>2008,</strong> I came out to my close friends and partner as transgender. A year later I was going by my chosen name of ""Jackson"", quit smoking and began binding. One year after that, I began hormone therapy.</p>
<p><strong> I have just celebrated 2 years of hormone therapy</strong> and I now fully pass as male. While the state of Kentucky and the rest of the country will technically not acknowledge that, I am perfectly happy explaining my trans-maleness to any authority figure and as long as I have my testosterone injections, my legal name change and all around well being, I don't mind one bit.</p>
<p>So here we are, at my <strong>FINAL</strong> stage of transition! I have no desire to transform myself beyond top surgery and so it is now that I ask for the help of my loved ones, colleagues, friends and communities.</p>
<p>I have found a doctor in Cleveland and have completed my evaluation. The cost of surgery with everything included will be <strong>$6,000.00</strong>. The additional <strong>$1,000.00</strong> is for travel, stay, food and paying my rent and bills while I am briefly out of work, recovering.</p>
<p><strong>A bit about my fiancial situation:</strong> I am a full-time student at the University of Kentucky in the Arts Administration program. In addition to that I do part-time Standardized Patient work for the College of Medicine, am the Sales &amp; Grants Director at WRFL 88.1 FM and a part-time receptionist for LexArts, a United Arts Fund.</p>
<p>I have paid off my credit card debt as of 3 years ago, do not own a car and live as modestly as I can. <em>I cannot afford this surgery.</em></p>
<p>Ideally, this surgery would have happened a long time ago, of course and the simple truth is that I can no longer wait for it. My binder, a sort of modern day corset is a kind of necessary evil. I cannot get around without it as I have a substantial  breast size. Because of this, I am having back problems. I cannot maintain my once perfect posture, my ribs ache and my muscles are overall being uneccessarily strained daily.</p>
<p>Also, I just want to be able to swim in a public pool, wear a tank top in the summertime, be able to lounge around my house without worrying who may drop by and simply <strong><em>feel okay with my body.</em></strong> I am 27 years old and I haven't loved my body. Ever. It has made it very hard for me to love myself.</p>
<p>I understand that these are hard times for all of us financially and your generosity will not go unnoticed. Please take a look at the <strong>perks</strong> I have listed. I really tried to think of things I could give within reason that I felt were unique to who I am and my relationship to my community.</p>
<p><em>If you have any questions, I am always down to talk. Top surgery can be a sticky topic for folks no matter how supportive they feel about transitioning. I get that and am always open to those discussions. Contact me anytime at</em></p>

I have been a professional since 2011. I plan to start up a mixed martial arts gym and nontraditional fitness center in Bryan, OH by February 1st, 2014. I want to start the gym because I have showed potential to be competitive in the sport of MMA but have never had the opportunity to train full time so that I can be a serious and successful competitor. MMA has worked wonders in my life and has led me to better my character, strengthen my belief in God, and create the start to a lasting legacy . I not only feel that my talent and record will improve, but that I can grow a successful business and better the lives of others through affordable fitness classes. At the start of this business I will offer a unique means of fitness to Bryan, OH. Offered will be membership to an all participation based fitness center. This center will function on a schedule that offers several classes back-to-back throughout the day. These classes will include MMA Technique, MMA Fitness, LIVE MMA Sparring and Grappling, MMA Srength and Jiu-Jitsu. All classes will be offered to men and women, youth through adult. It is my goal to help instill quality of life to members who join the gym. These fitness classes will make it affordable to obtain physical fitness. With this unique format of operation, members will receive quality attention and personal training at no added expense. This will keep members engaged in wellness and promote healthiness and happiness through the means of nontraditional fitness and mixed martial arts. This gym will help transform the lives of members by creating a blueprint for success through physical fitness. At this gym we encourage and uplift one another for the betterment of all who share the same passion for fitness.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Matt Montalvo will need $8,000 for the start up cost of a mixed martial arts and nontraditional fitness center. New mats, wall pads, heavy bags, stand up bags, Thai pads, boxing gloves, shin pads, body pads, kettle bells, jump ropes, heavy rope, pull up bar mount, sledge hammer, tractor tire, mma gloves, headgear, hand wraps, mat cleaner, mat mop, start up costs, advertising, and New League Fitness gym apparel will need to be purchased. To ensure the cleanliness and safety of the gym it is necessary to purchase all stated items. New League Fitness apparel will advertise sponsors who contribute to Matt ""Mean Bean"" Montalvo and or to New League Fitness. The perks in which I am offering include an autographed picture of Matt ""Mean Bean"" Montalvo, New League Fitness T-Shirt, General Admission Tickets to a professional MMA event Matt Montalvo competes in, VIP tickets to a professional MMA event Matt Montalvo competes in, and finally the sponsorship perks. See perks for details. Contributors can choose from the dates Matt Montalvo has a fight scheduled within one calendar year of the end of this campaign. It is my goal to achieve my career goals so that sponsors can receive international publicity. If the entire goal is not met then the use of funds will still go towards these costs. The funds will be used strategically to ensure a promising opening and future of the business. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>This business 's goal is to enrich the lives of all those who seek to obtain ideal physical fitness by means of nontraditional workouts and mixed martial arts.  The gym will allow me train full time in efforts to compete on the most elite of stages such as the UFC and Bellator (giving sponsors maximum exposure.) Also this gym will be a place of growth. This gym will give members a sense of belonging. It is my effort to show that success can be learned. I plan to be held accountable by all contributors, members, and sponsors in efforts to achieve my personal goals of fighting in bigger and more notable MMA promotions. I am making an honest effort of bettering my own life so that I can help others seek happiness and wholeness as well. I want to be a leader and lead by example. Through mixed martial arts and nontraditional fitness classes, lives can change and be transformed for the better. It is my goal to achieve my dreams in the midst of so many people so that others can see that nothing is impossible. Through faith, persistence, and a great outlook and attitude in life, anything can be achieved. A blueprint for success will be created when each member sees their personal fitness goals being achieved through the fitness classes New League Fitness offers. I want to show people that anything can be done and that they themselves can be the ones who do it. I am in a position where I can administer to the youth of the community and spread positive ideals through the avenues that the popularity of mixed martial arts has created. I feel that because mixed martial arts is so popular and because it attracts a younger demographic, that it creates the perfect opportunity to make a positive impact in the lives of children. I have been blessed to have worked with teens before and plan on teaching youth classes at this gym as well. I am in the process of a two year sobriety goal in which I keep my network of friends, family, and fans updated on via social media, holding me accountable to the completion of it. I plan to set goals like this continually so that I may lead by example. I have been able to accrue a list of over 40 people who would join New League Fitness at its time of start up and it is believed that more will join at New League Fitness's official and legitimate opening. I believe that by helping others and providing a good value and service, that I in turn will be blessed with the time and energy it will take to accomplish my professional career goals. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><h3>Please Promote this campaign via any means of social media and word of mouth.

<h2>UPDATE</h2>
<h3>The Milano Meneghins are NOT going to World Cup</h3>
<p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>Yesterday night I sent an email to Logan Anbinder from the <span class=""caps"">IQA</span> to tell him that, sadly, we won’t be able to be there.</p>
<p>We have tried until the very last moment to make the impossible possible in this little amount of time and, despite still being very distant from the goal we set for ourselves on this campaign, we have been, two or three times, on the verge of saying yes to the World Cup. Thanks a billion to everyone in the <span class=""caps"">IQA</span> who tried until the very last to have us at <span class=""caps"">WCVI</span>!</p>
<p>We can’t be present, and we won’t be able to meet most of you in person as soon as we would have liked to, but we are happy you could get a glimpse of who we are. We are getting you your perks at the world cup anyway thanks to the friends that are willing to help us! That and having you there, you who supported us, will be our way to be somehow present at World Cup!</p>
<p>What will be left of your contributions after the cost of perks and shipping is deducted is going into travelling costs for the team in Italy and Europe: since we aren’t coming to Florida we will be concentrating our efforts on playing over here, getting better and helping quidditch grow where we live.

<p>We are the Milano Meneghins, and we play quidditch! Yes, the one with brooms. No, we don't fly. Yes, there is a Snitch. No, that one doesn't fly either.<br/><br/><br/></p>
<h3>The story a bit less short</h3>
<p>Ok, let's try it again. We play quidditch, or muggle quidditch, an adaptation of the sport invented by J. K. Rowling in the Harry Potter series, that was born in 2005 in Middlebury College, Vermont.</p>
<p>The sport is a fun mix of rugby/european handball for some of the players (keepers and chasers), dodgeball (beaters) and tag (seekers with the snitch runner). 4 balls in play, well, 5 if you count the Snitch, which is tucked into the snitch runner's shorts, 7 players per side. It's a contact sport and fully co-ed, the rules state that every team must field at least 2 athletes not recognizing themselves in the same gender as the others, at all times.</p>
<p>And we use a broom. Why? Because it's fun, and an element that increases the importance of skills. And because it's quidditch, duh!</p>
<p>The idea slowly made its way to Europe, then Italy, and here's us!</p>

<p>The team met for the first time in april 2012, in a public park where we still practice most of the times. We are a community team, ages ranging from 18 to 26, and our quidditch story so far includes winning the first Italian tournament in June 2012, being the first italian IQA official team shortly after that and getting the 3rd place in the first European Regional in Lesparre-Médoc, France.</p>
<p>The group is slowly getting bigger, and we're improving our game, while quidditch spreads in the rest of Italy too. We are looking forward to a final tournament with all the active Italian teams this June, where we hope to finally get to meet all the italian quidditch players we haven't met thus far.</p>
<p>Quidditch has brought together all of us, despite us coming from really different backgrounds and having different ideas, and all our new players have seen how they can feel like they belong even only after one game.

The Milano Meneghins are NOT going to World Cup
Hello everybody!
Yesterday night I sent an email to Logan Anbinder from the IQA to tell him that, sadly, we won’t be able to be there.
We have tried until the very last moment to make the impossible possible in this little amount of time and, despite still being very distant from the goal we set for ourselves on this campaign, we have been, two or three times, on the verge of saying yes to the World Cup. Thanks a billion to everyone in the IQA who tried until the very last to have us at WCVI!
We can’t be present, and we won’t be able to meet most of you in person as soon as we would have liked to, but we are happy you could get a glimpse of who we are. We are getting you your perks at the world cup anyway thanks to the friends that are willing to help us! That and having you there, you who supported us, will be our way to be somehow present at World Cup!
What will be left of your contributions after the cost of perks and shipping is deducted is going into travelling costs for the team in Italy and Europe: since we aren’t coming to Florida we will be concentrating our efforts on playing over here, getting better and helping quidditch grow where we live. And getting ready to kick ass at next World Cup ;)
So, thank you, thank you, thank you, and good bye for now!
P.S.: for those who chose the postcard, video or jersey, please let us know the details, so that you can get exactly what you want! For jerseys especially I will very soon get in touch with people I don’t have details for.

We are the Milano Meneghins, and we play quidditch! Yes, the one with brooms. No, we don't fly. Yes, there is a Snitch. No, that one doesn't fly either.

<p>My name is Jaimie Jurgensen. My wife and I have four lovely children. Around the last part of 2011 we began having problems in the duplexes we were renting. Moisture was appearing all throughout the house, every night. Mold began to appear as well. Before the mold began to appear, we contacted maintenence about the moisture. After numerous calls, the maintenence man came out and told me the place needed to be remodeled. These duplexes were old military housing that had been decommisioned and never fixed up. We did our best to keep our house dry, but a few weeks later, we began to get sick. I was vomiting and having breathing problems, my youngest children were both put on breathing treatments and inhalers as well. My wife and children had various illnesses during this as well.</p>
<p>One day my wife and kids were on our bed and I jumped in to the pile of love myself. As I did, the bed came away from the wall and we noticed that behind where the bed was on the wall, was huge patches of various colors of mold. Mainly a blackish color though. We went through the house looking behind things, checking closets, behind pictures, etc. We found mold over the house. Mainly concentrated in our bedroom though. We contacted the manager of our building, demanding something be done, our clothes and things replaced, and were denied. We were told our renters insurance should cover these items, but the insurance stated that since it was a preexisting condition of the duplexes, it was THEIR responsibility to do this. I contacted the manager again and asked for cleanup and a mold test to be done. They came and did their alleged cleanup and test. We had to go stay in hotels during this, draining our dwindling finances further, we were not allowed to stay at the house. After the alleged cleanup, I asked to see copies of the mold report, worried about what was in our house. Especially since my littlest ones were sick and my wife and I were also having bad problems. We were given the round around so bad, it got to the point that I contacted another company and had them come in and do a mold test. During this process, we noticed the moisture had come back, the mold was showing through on places they had painted. Where there was drywall, it was getting so wet it was falling out of the places they had patched. It was a nightmare. Adding to the nightmare, the mold report I commisioned came back showing HUGE amounts of toxic black mold in our bedroom and high levels elsewhere in the duplex. We complained about the problems contuining to managment and repeated the cleaning process at least 4 times more. During this, the managment told me their mold report came back clear, yet refused to allow me to see a copy of it.</p>
<p>By this time it was around February '12. We had had enough. The health concerns and problems were mounting. The whole family was being affected and we were getting no where with the managment of the duplexes. Something had to give, we were being lied to by people who are supposed to follow laws concerning this, but were not. We contacted many lawyers about this and while everyone told us we had a case, no one seemed to want to take it. I had our mold report, pictures, witnesses, the whole nine yards, but couldn't get anywhere for awhile. With no other choice, but to stay and get sicker, we put all our possesions into storage and went to stay with some of my wifes family in another town. During this period, I lost my job due to all the events occuring and my ongoing health problems. Things quickly fell apart from there, culminating in us bouncing around friend to friend and culminated in us being homeless. This went on for months. I was able to get another job and move us into a discounted rent situation. The landlord was absolutely horrible and odd, but beggars can't be choosers. I continued to work my butt off to rebuild our lives, when problems started occuring in my arms. I recieved tendon and ligment damage to both arms, landing me smack dab on disablity status at 31. I need corrective surgery to fix arms, long story short. My wife has found work, but we still aren't making ends meet. County aid is anything but, with being accepted then cut off. Red Cross and Salvation Army don't help people, that are victims of this. We've tried everything we could. We are paying out of pocket for our medical, no insurance. Nightmare city.</p>
<p>Through this horrid patch, we did get a lawyer interested in our case though. He commended me for the evidence I had collected, moving out, putting things in storage, etc. and is trying to help us now. While I have done most things right and made smart moves concerning a lawsuit, due to our health problems, we need to see a specialist in L.A. to go further with our case and get our problems documented, which leads to why I am here, asking for your help and prayers. We have lost everything. My children have been through so much, my wife as well. I am now disabled and useless and we are just not able to make things work. The strain on our lives and marriage is tremendous. We have very little family or friends and they have helped as much as they possibly could. Our backs are up against a wall and we are left with no where else to turn.  </p>
<p><strong>What we are asking for and why:</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for $20,000 (holy s**t that's a lot, I know). The testing and visit to the specialist in L.A. is $5,000 a head. ""But wait, you're only asking for $20k and there are 4 of you..."" Yes, we know. Our main concern is getting my wife and youngest daughter tested, since they stayed in the room, with the highest concentration of the spores and suffer the most problems. Next up is my second youngest, due to her problems health wise. That's $15,000 right there. The other $5k would go to paying our outstanding bills, putting food on our table (at the time of writing this, I have literally 4 dinners left to make us), helping us outfit the kids for school (supplies and some decent clothes, backpacks, etc.), putting gas in my wifes vehicle, so she can get to work and other everyday expenses.</p>
<p><br/>Getting us tested by this doctor is the puzzle piece we are missing in going after these people for what they've done to us and getting justice for my family and all that we have lost. It's not about getting a huge settlement, it's about making right on all we've lost and what we've suffered due to this. Imagine losing it all. Everything from when you were a baby on up. Imagine it happening to your kids. All they're favorite toys and books, all of it, gone. The health problems and expenses. The lies fed to you and your family.....</p>
<p>The rest of the money as I said, goes to us living decently for a short while. It's been a long time since that's happened and I want to see my babies smile again. I want my wife to be happy and I'd like to also be a little happy. Being disabled and being shot down left and right for everything, this all I can think to do now.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if you beat the goal?</strong></p>
<p>Anything we make beyond the goal, goes to the rest of the children and myself, being tested. 6 people = $30k for all of us to be tested. After $30k and up to $40k, goes towards paying dow our debts and bills, putting food on the table, taking care of the kids and replacing their things. Now, if we somehow manage to make more than $40k, what we are planning to do with the money after that is starting a foundation for those in situations like ours.</p>
<p><strong>A foundation?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We are not the only suffers of toxic black mold. We aren't the only family out there with health problems, getting shot down for aid left and right. We all know things aren't easy these days and if we make more than our goal, we want to help out others like us. Helping them with mold tests, visiting doctors, paying hotel/rent expenses, bills, food, etc. Whatever we can do to pay it forward. The best way we think to do that, is setup a foundation, to help people in similar circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>How does this story end? </strong></p>
<p>We don't know. We are trying to go after the company that did this to us, hence this campaign to help us with the testing and possibly food and bills. Our situation is dire, but we are doing everything we can. Despite being disabled, I am still fighting to recieve, actual disability payments from SSI, I am out hunting for jobs that don't really require my hands and as you can imagine, that is not easy. My wife is working and as I said above, we still can't make the ends meet. The medical expenses, prescriptions, bills and everything else, have driven us into debt, when before we were doing alright. If we can get the help we need, we can get over this mountain of a hump and start rebuilding. We just need some breathing room and to get these tests done, so we can hopefully recoup our losses from the company that managed the duplexes. If the lawsuit doesn't work, then at least we have the breathing so I can maybe find work and we can start putting into savings again, instead of always taking out until it's past dry, like it is now.</p>

We don't know. We are trying to go after the company that did this to us, hence this campaign to help us with the testing and possibly food and bills. Our situation is dire, but we are doing everything we can. Despite being disabled, I am still fighting to recieve, actual disability payments from SSI, I am out hunting for jobs that don't really require my hands and as you can imagine, that is not easy. My wife is working and as I said above, we still can't make the ends meet. The medical expenses, prescriptions, bills and everything else, have driven us into debt, when before we were doing alright. If we can get the help we need, we can get over this mountain of a hump and start rebuilding. We just need some breathing room and to get these tests done, so we can hopefully recoup our losses from the company that managed the duplexes. If the lawsuit doesn't work, then at least we have the breathing so I can maybe find work and we can start putting into savings again, instead of always taking out until it's past dry, like it is now.
 If you can't donate, please tweet the link for this, tell your friends, notify your news channel, email co-workers, please help our story get out and expose these people. Thank you.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>My wife Rachelle, has been diagnosed with Chronic Sclerosing Osteomyelitis (CSO) which is a very rare and delibitating/painful bone infection--and is in need of a 5th major surgery on her jaw in the past year and a half. </span></p>
<div><span>She is headed to Miami in July to have the right side of her lower jaw removed and replaced with a titanium chain (Wide Jaw Resection). This type of surgery is typically reserved for cancer patients, but according to the doctors, is the only way to remove the infection and allow her to resume her normal live.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>She will have to remain in/near the hospital following surgery for at least 9-12 days to ensure she is recovering correctly. Her surgery is being performed by the world-renowned Dr. Marx, who actually played a key role in discovering this extremely rare chronic bone infection.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>Six months to a year after the first surgery, she will fly back to Miami to undergo a bone graft to restore her jawbone with bone from her leg/hip. Once the bone graft has taken place, her jaw will be wired shut for roughly 6 weeks. The overall recovery time following the second surgery is 4-6 months. </span></div>
<div>
<h3>More about Rachelle</h3>
</div>
<div><span>As Rachelle has not been able to work on her fashion collection for two years because of this chronic illness, we are finally able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Albeit a long a grueling 12-18 month recovery period following her surgery in July, she is expected to fully recover and be able to pursue her dreams moving forward.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>As a Fashion Designer and Entrepenuer, Rachelle achieved immediate success and was on her way to showing her collection in major fashion events throughout the world, including New York Fashion Week. She has dressed celebrities ranging from Miss Universe to Carrie Fisher, and was eager to build her fashion empire when she became chronically ill.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Additionally, Rachelle has been apart of several charitable projects and has donated to many different causes over the past three years. She's in a difficult position because she's usually the one donating goods and services, but now she's the one who needs assistance.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p><span>The money raised will be used for medical and other expenses not covered by insurance. A breakdown on how these funds will be used:</span></p>
<div><span>• Deductibles</span></div>
<div><span>• Co-Payments</span></div>
<div><span>• Not Covered Benefits and Medications</span></div>
<div><span>• Travel Costs (airplane tickets, hotels, food, gas, etc...)</span></div>
<div><span>• Supplements and therapy</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, Rachelle is fighting an extremely rare and painful bone infection and we need all the help we can get. We've seen a dozen doctors in Austin and at the Mayo and finally found a doctor who could correctly diagnose the condition.</p>
<p>Once Rachelle has the next two major surgeries and is hopefully back on her feet, she plans to write a book and share her tramatic experience with as many people as she can.</p>
<p>The doctor who diagnosed this condition stated that more and more people have been affected by this issue but have gone undiagnosed. Rachelle hopes to develop a support system for people dealing with chronic pain and to educate the general public and medical professionals about this condition.</p>

<p>We understand that everyone cannot financially assist us and that is perfectly fine. Please share this page with your friends and family so we can try to meet our goal.</p>

<p class=""p1""><strong>Who We Are:    </strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">The Video is a great example of the community and space we are trying to build in Fairfield.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Boom Fitness is a collective of dedicated trainers brought together by the belief in the foundations of CrossFit. The stimulus provided is always varied and the results are dramatic. The atmosphere is one of support and camaraderie to anyone willing to put in the work. The coaching is supportive, enthusiastic and welcoming to <strong>anyone</strong> who is willing to focus and put in the work. We offer group and private training.</p>
<p class=""p3"">We believe that better movement and increased range of motion are the cornerstones of fitness and that quality coaching is a pivotal part of your experience in becoming a healthier human being. We are here to help our clients become the happiest, healthiest, and most capable people possible.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Boom Fitness aims to be a community of diverse individuals. We currently have elite athletes, students, programmers, and lawyers. We have moms, dads, brothers, and sisters. We have clients who are old, young, and everywhere in between. The things they share are motivation, hard work, honesty, and desire to be better. These are the fundamental characteristics that we are going to build our business and our community here in Fairfield upon. Those who join our community will be guided and nourished. Our personal measure for success is to bring out the best in you, through fitness. </p>
<p class=""p3""><strong>What We Do:</strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">Boom Fitness will coach Crossfit style workouts. Crossfit is an empirically driven, clinically tested and community developed strength and conditioning program. We are an assembly of dedicated trainers who want our clients to become stronger, leaner, faster, and more coordinated. We help mold our clients into better functioning beings with the broadest goal of promoting health. We mix gymnastics (body control), weightlifting (control of external objects), and cardiovascular training in as many ways as possible. Crossfit has quickly gained popularity across demographics from NFL quarterbacks to soccer moms because simply, it works.<span class=""s1""> </span></p>
<p class=""p3"">The workouts are always challenging and never boring. All classes or private trainings are coached by a Crossfit Certified trainer. Each workout is scaled by load and intensity but not by kind. All fitness levels from elite athletes to grandmothers can participate in the same class. </p>
<p class=""p3"">CrossFit is not your ordinary workout. But it is for ordinary people looking for dramatic results.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Our Story:</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Ti Liptak and Jeffrey Stone are looking to share their passion for fitness and health with Fairfield. We both grew up in Fairfield and spent many hours of our lives playing sports. What fuels our passion is the positive impact that active living has had on our lives and in the lives of the people that we coach. In order to provide the best experience for our clients we need our own space and the best equipment available.</p>
<p class=""p3""><strong>About Our Space:</strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">Boom Fitness is located at 210 West Lowe in Fairfield (near Everybody’s and BP Gas). When you enter our 2400 square foot space, you will quickly realize we are a very different workout experience. In place of workout machines that isolate muscles, you will find Olympic bars, free weights, kettlebells, medicine balls, pullup bars, and jump ropes by Rogue Fitness. This is the same gear used in the Reebok / ESPN’s Crossfit Games. In line with the Crossfit style of efficient functionality, you won’t find mirrors or televisions. What you will quickly find is that we have everything you need to get in phenomenal shape. You can use your mirror at home for verification.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Soon after opening, we plan to add equipment to hold martial arts and yoga classes at Boom Fitness... </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">Fairfield is a unique and very health conscious town, yet there is still no facility that caters to specialized training. What we will do is simple, make our clients happier, healthier, and live more active lives through smart functional training. The strongest communities we feel are formed around healthy people, our gym will become a hub for a full range of fairfield citizens to get together and share life. </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:  </strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">We are asking for $2,000. All of this money will go towards initial operating expenses and to add equipment. If we don't reach our goal we will still be opening the space in the middle of December. What your financial contribution will do is increase our chances of becoming a successful business by lightening our initial financial pressure. Your contribution will go toward utilities, rent, and equipment (Weights, paint, wood, jump ropes, etc...)</p>

<p>My name is James Boyce, President and CEO of Dentures Online.  Dentures Online has been serving the United States since 2006, fitting thousands of people with custom full and partial dentures without ever leaving their home.  Over the years, we have come across many people who struggle with affording the high cost of dental care. The video above describes our goal of partnering with you through matching donations to provide up to 25 people with dentures at no cost to them.</p>
<p>We’re excited to hit as close to our goal of $15,000 as possible to provide custom fitted dentures to as many low income individuals as we can. Many of us personally know of someone struggling in this economy—or those who live below the poverty level on the streets. Please help us bring dignity and smiles back to their lives.</p>
<p>Our first participant is Patrick, a disabled Gulf War veteran, who feels like he has completely lost himself and his confidence due to his missing teeth. Although trained in good oral practices as a child, Patrick found as an adult that anything less than diligent and persistent dental care sufficed. Today, Patrick rarely leaves his home because of fear of being ridiculed and says this program would greatly change his life by restoring his confidence and self worth. With Patrick's previous dedication to our country, his committed attitude towards improving his dental care, and his situation in life, we have selected him as our first Denture Assistance Program participant. We are dedicated to seeing his case through and we hope you are moved to spread the word about this worthy cause and contribute to it. Please partner with us to give many deserving people a new smile and life!</p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>We are looking for $15,000 dollars for dental material, shipping, and one on one consultation with the patient.  We are beginning the process with our first patient, Patrick, in good faith that you will be as excited about this as we are.</p>
<p>We will update our page on the process of every patient. We want you to know these individuals and how you have helped them get their smiles back. </p>
<p>Everyone who donates $25 will recieve 10% off any product on Dentures Online.</p>
<p>Everyone who donates $50 will recieve 20% off any product on Dentures Online. </p>
<p>Finally, a $100 donation will get you 30% off of any product. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Imagine how your life would be different if you had an accident that destroyed your teeth. Your whole world would change—what you could eat, how you would look, and even interaction with others and the embarrassment and self-consciousness of your smile. Losing teeth, whether partial or all, causes a loss of dignity and respect. Add to that the enormous cost of dentistry, and it becomes even more of a painful, humiliating experience.</p>

What We Need & What You Get

We are looking for $15,000 dollars for dental material, shipping, and one on one consultation with the patient.  We are beginning the process with our first patient, Patrick, in good faith that you will be as excited about this as we are.
We will update our page on the process of every patient. We want you to know these individuals and how you have helped them get their smiles back. 
Everyone who donates $25 will recieve 10% off any product on Dentures Online.
Everyone who donates $50 will recieve 20% off any product on Dentures Online. 
Finally, a $100 donation will get you 30% off of any product. 
 


The Impact
Imagine how your life would be different if you had an accident that destroyed your teeth. Your whole world would change—what you could eat, how you would look, and even interaction with others and the embarrassment and self-consciousness of your smile. Losing teeth, whether partial or all, causes a loss of dignity and respect. Add to that the enormous cost of dentistry, and it becomes even more of a painful, humiliating experience.

<p>Our pressure pump 
controller is a “Smoke detector for your Water System” and is vital for 
anyone who uses a pressure pump to move water from tanks, river or dams.<br/></p>
<p>Water is vital for our existence,  everywhere you look there are more &amp; more stories of drought.  Communities, farmers, families, livestock, pets, crops are personally affected, or know someone who is, by the quality and amount of water available.   We want to do something to help.</p>
<p><b>We cracked the water loss puzzle now we need your help!</b><br/><br/><b>What is the Problem?</b><br/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have found first hand that pump and water suppliers have NO interest 
in you protecting your pump and water, their revenue is tied to your 
loss. <br/><br/>If a pressure pump water system develops a leak caused by ‘damage to the pipes’ or ‘taps left on’ or other loss of pressure then the water pump will continue to pump, spilling out your water supply and if not stopped, causing damage to your pump.  Significant water loss can damage dwellings, property, cause injury or disadvantage to families and their livestock.</p>
<p>There are existing technologies which will stop/protect your pump but this is only after all of the water has been spilled out and lost <br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“H20 Stop The Flow” is a patented device that monitors the flow of water; if there is a loss of pressure from pipe damage or a tap is left on it stops the pump automatically after a predetermined amount of time.  You protect your water supply, your pump, your livestock, family and mental health and happiness.<br/><br/>Our product has been developed and tested in a wired version and it is now being developed in a Plug &amp; Play version which will take 15 seconds to install on most standard ground level tanks and once fitted the water supply attached to that pump is PROTECTED.<br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>History</h3>
<p></p>Hi my name is Robert Porter-Coote and a number of years ago my wife and I operated a commercial pig farm in NSW Australia.  Our water was sourced from a fresh water creek pumped up to the Piggery and home via a pressure pump on the creek bank and a water tank to augment home use.  <br/><br/>Our pig building was about 100 meters long with over 200 hundred water pipe connections plus the water troughs.  Night or day the pigs would play with the water system and create leaks &amp; sometimes more than one. (they are very smart)<br/><br/>I soon became aware of a problem in the way basic water pressure pumps work.  Simply, when you turn a tap on the water flows and the pump runs.  If you don't know that the tap has been turned on (or in our case leaks in the water system from the piggery) the pump continues to run pumping water happily.  <br/><br/>If you have a limited amount of water, you can, in the space of about 2 hours lose up to 10,000litres of your precious clean water. If you run out of water the pump runs dry and eventually this can damage your pump.<br/><br/>We could not let this happen. Since our creek was feed by rain fall it had limited capacity and we ran the risk of running out of water not to mention other farmers who would be at a disadvantage and understandably angry.  <br/><br/>I talked to local pump companies in the area and we were told that the best thing to do was to change to a no flow pump that would shut off when the water flow ceased. <br/><br/><ol>
<li>The pump will stop when you have used all of your water supply.  (If you are running at 5 thousand litres an hour in 2 hours you will have emptied a 10 thousand litre tank.</li>
<li>The pump is not designed to run for hours.</li>
<li>Your power bill might be a rude shock.  </li>
</ol>
<br/>None of this sounded like a good solution to me……………….<br/>We moved out of the pig industry before we solved the problem, however, I continued to work on a solution as I believe it is a <b>PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED</b> as it affects all water users.<br/><br/>For 8 Years I could not find a device that would stop the water loss from a water Pressure Pump, let alone a town water supply or a gravity fed system,  if the delivery line was left open or broken causing pressure loss.<br/><br/>Then I had a brainstorm which resulted in the development of the “H20 Stop the flow” device.<br/><br/>My initial device works on town water systems.  This patented system is certified and has been tested in Australia. <br/><br/>The “Town Water Saver” (this works on any town supply not pressure pumps) requires a plumber or a DIY handy person to install and is hardwired into your home water system. It has been tested in every state in Australia and we have not had a failure to date.<br/><br/>I have now turned my attention to the Pressure Pump version.  Adopting what I have learned I created a device that works on pressure pumps but in a wired version that takes about 15 minutes to install and some know-how on connecting wires.  I wanted to make it so easy that anyone who could plug in a toaster could use so I created a plug and Play version that attaches directly to the power for your pressure pump and it works a treat.<br/><br/>And here we are today!<br/>
</div></div>","H20 Stop the Flow - The Revolutionary Plug & Play device that will STOP water loss and save your pressure pump
Our pressure pump 
controller is a “Smoke detector for your Water System” and is vital for 
anyone who uses a pressure pump to move water from tanks, river or dams.
Water is vital for our existence,  everywhere you look there are more & more stories of drought.  Communities, farmers, families, livestock, pets, crops are personally affected, or know someone who is, by the quality and amount of water available.   We want to do something to help.
We cracked the water loss puzzle now we need your help!What is the Problem?

I have found first hand that pump and water suppliers have NO interest 
in you protecting your pump and water, their revenue is tied to your 
loss. If a pressure pump water system develops a leak caused by ‘damage to the pipes’ or ‘taps left on’ or other loss of pressure then the water pump will continue to pump, spilling out your water supply and if not stopped, causing damage to your pump.  Significant water loss can damage dwellings, property, cause injury or disadvantage to families and their livestock.
There are existing technologies which will stop/protect your pump but this is only after all of the water has been spilled out and lost 

“H20 Stop The Flow” is a patented device that monitors the flow of water; if there is a loss of pressure from pipe damage or a tap is left on it stops the pump automatically after a predetermined amount of time.  You protect your water supply, your pump, your livestock, family and mental health and happiness.Our product has been developed and tested in a wired version and it is now being developed in a Plug & Play version which will take 15 seconds to install on most standard ground level tanks and once fitted the water supply attached to that pump is PROTECTED.

*Note:  Elevated tank systems needing one additional item fitted past the pump, which can be fitted easily by a DIY handy person, to stop the siphoning effect.
H20 stop the flow ‘Hard wired’ version has been tested in homes and farms around Australia.   A hard wired version for Town water systems has also been developed and is certified EMS.  For information on this system visit our website.  http://www.h2ostoptheflow.com.au/products/town_flow_stopperYour assistance will help us……

is about your life. And the lives of others. </h3>
<p>It’s
about all of our lives – the ones that are constantly bombarded and interrupted
and influenced by our phones with everyday stuff like texts, emails, Facebook updates, and photos and…. </p>
<p>All
these things distract us from our world -- from the things that are going on
around us, and from the other people all around. </p>
<p>Unfortunately
and all too often, lives are destroyed because of these distractions coming
from our phones. Especially when driving. Taking your eyes off the road for 5 seconds to read a text is the equivalent of driving the length of a football field blindfolded. More than 3,000 people each year are killed by distracted driving.</p>
<p>But
with Groove, we can be free of that danger. With simple actions backed by
advanced technology, we can take control back. We can create a driving
environment that is good for our lives, and good for the lives of our friends,
our family, our community and our world. </p>
<p>Katasi Groove
is a gadget that lets us stop things like texts, emails, and social media from reaching our phones when we are behind the wheel – while still
allowing us to rock out to our music and use navigation. We can control what we want to
do and what we don’t want to do when driving. </p>
<p>With Groove, we empower ourselves to live beyond our phones. We are
focused. Aware. Present to our surroundings and the people that surround us. We
become better drivers, but more importantly, we become better humans. </p><p></p><h3><b>What
Can Katasi's Groove Do?</b></h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Groove is a little box, smaller than a
pack of cards, which plugs into a socket underneath your steering wheel that
you probably didn’t even know you had. 
Plug it in, send a one-time text message on your phone to the number provided,
and you're done. Within seconds of turning your car on, incoming and outgoing
distractions are limited by your phone provider. Turn your car off, and full
function returns to your phone.</span><br/></p>
<p>How
Does It Do That?  It’s crazy simple; your
car is driven by only a few family members, or maybe just you. Register the
phones of the drivers in your family to the car, and Groove sorts out the rest.
When a drive starts, Groove quickly determines which of these phones are in the
car, and which family member is driving. It alerts your Carrier within seconds and they limit
distraction to and from your phone. That's the Groove magic.  Distractions are limited by your mobile phone Carrier before they reach the phone.  When you stop your car, full function is returned within seconds and any stored messages are delivered.</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px; text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">You
always have the ability to use your phone in an emergency.</b></p>
<p>911
calls or texts are never blocked and even the Groove system can be easily overridden
if need be.</p><h4><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">""But
what about distractions, like Snapchat,  iMessage,
or email?""</span></h4>
<p>That’s
part of the magic. Groove Carrier partners disable data-based distractions
while allowing capabilities such as music streaming and navigation. Disable web
browsing, but allow Pandora? Sure. Enable Maps, but disable Snapchat? You
got it.</p>
<p>The
best part about Groove is that it Just Works. It is the distracted driving
solution that actually stops distractions before they ever reach your phone.
This means that there is nothing to download, nothing to manage, nothing to update and nothing to
worry about. </p>
<p>Turn
your car on, and we'll turn the distractions off. It's as easy as that.</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px; text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">But
Wait! There’s More!</b></p>
<p>Groove
also comes with a game that lets drivers earn points and rewards for good
driving. With a simple opt-in, the Groove technology will start keeping track of your driving mastery.  Every 5 miles of focused driving (no phone distractions, swerving or jamming on the brakes) earns you a Gruve,  an acknowledgement of 5 miles of   driving perfection.  </p>
<p>Each Gruve gets you points, and streaks of Gruves add to your multiplier and points really start rolling in. Stay focused, though; any lapse
in safe driving will knock your multiplier down to zero. </p>
<p>The
points you earn can be exchanged for awesome rewards like free food, discounts
on gas, or even big items like concert tickets!</p><p>
</p><h3>What
Are We Asking You to Do?</h3>
<p>This is more than a product. It’s a mission. An ever-evolving movement to get us all to be more safe, more aware and more engaged. We are almost there and need your help for the last mile.  Katasi has been developing Groove in partnership with two of the four Carriers, and are poised to launch Groove with our chosen Anchor Carrier next year.  That's the great news.</p><p>But that's not enough.  It's not just protecting you from distractions when you drive, it should also be protecting the driver of that car coming at you at 70 mph that could cross the center line.  This is why we need every Carrier on board.    </p><p>Groove lets the Carrier know when someone is driving so your Carrier can limit what distracts you while you drive.  We call this Net-Switching, and it is a connection between Groove and your Carrier that enables your Carrier to block distractions and hold onto your messages until the drive is over. Net-Switching also allows Groove to sort cellular data and enable or disable certain apps according to your wishes.<br/></p><p>Net-Switching isn't Rocket Science.  It is a matter of making connections between Groove and already existing switches in the Carrier networks, to react to the Groove alert that someone is driving. But it does require investment and a good reason to make the investment.  We believe that saving thousands of lives is worthy of that investment. </p></div>","This

become better drivers, but more importantly, we become better humans. What
Can Katasi's Groove Do?
Groove is a little box, smaller than a
pack of cards, which plugs into a socket underneath your steering wheel that
you probably didn’t even know you had. 
Plug it in, send a one-time text message on your phone to the number provided,
and you're done. Within seconds of turning your car on, incoming and outgoing
distractions are limited by your phone provider. Turn your car off, and full
function returns to your phone.
How
Does It Do That?  It’s crazy simple; your
car is driven by only a few family members, or maybe just you. Register the
phones of the drivers in your family to the car, and Groove sorts out the rest.
When a drive starts, Groove quickly determines which of these phones are in the
car, and which family member is driving. It alerts your Carrier within seconds and they limit
distraction to and from your phone. That's the Groove magic.  Distractions are limited by your mobile phone Carrier before they reach the phone.  When you stop your car, full function is returned within seconds and any stored messages are delivered.You
always have the ability to use your phone in an emergency.
911
calls or texts are never blocked and even the Groove system can be easily overridden
if need be.""But
what about distractions, like Snapchat,  iMessage,
or email?""
That’s
part of the magic. Groove Carrier partners disable data-based distractions
while allowing capabilities such as music streaming and navigation. Disable web
browsing, but allow Pandora? Sure. Enable Maps, but disable Snapchat? You
got it.
The
best part about Groove is that it Just Works. It is the distracted driving
solution that actually stops distractions before they ever reach your phone.
This means that there is nothing to download, nothing to manage, nothing to update and nothing to
worry about. 
Turn
your car on, and we'll turn the distractions off. It's as easy as that.But
Wait! There’s More!
Groove
also comes with a game that lets drivers earn points and rewards for good
driving. With a simple opt-in, the Groove technology will start keeping track of your driving mastery.  Every 5 miles of focused driving (no phone distractions, swerving or jamming on the brakes) earns you a Gruve,  an acknowledgement of 5 miles of   driving perfection.  
Each Gruve gets you points, and streaks of Gruves add to your multiplier and points really start rolling in. Stay focused, though; any lapse
in safe driving will knock your multiplier down to zero. 
The
points you earn can be exchanged for awesome rewards like free food, discounts
on gas, or even big items like concert tickets!
What
Are We Asking You to Do?
This is more than a product. It’s a mission. An ever-evolving movement to get us all to be more safe, more aware and more engaged. We are almost there and need your help for the last mile.  Katasi has been developing Groove in partnership with two of the four Carriers, and are poised to launch Groove with our chosen Anchor Carrier next year.  That's the great news.But that's not enough.  It's not just protecting you from distractions when you drive, it should also be protecting the driver of that car coming at you at 70 mph that could cross the center line.  This is why we need every Carrier on board.    Groove lets the Carrier know when someone is driving so your Carrier can limit what distracts you while you drive.  We call this Net-Switching, and it is a connection between Groove and your Carrier that enables your Carrier to block distractions and hold onto your messages until the drive is over. Net-Switching also allows Groove to sort cellular data and enable or disable certain apps according to your wishes.Net-Switching isn't Rocket Science.  It is a matter of making connections between Groove and already existing switches in the Carrier networks, to react to the Groove alert that someone is driving. But it does require investment and a good reason to make the investment.  We believe that saving thousands of lives is worthy of that investment.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<b>How it All Began  </b>
</div><div>Last year, my childhood friend and best friend to this day, Theresa, who lives in the Philippines was suddenly diagnosed with a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer.  Stage 2 Triple Negative. </div><div><br/></div><div>From a simple medical inquiry through email, Dr. Denis Fitzgerald, a<span> very kind oncologist in Little Silver, New Jersey offered to give her the rounds of chemotherapy she needed at an affordable out of pocket cost.  W</span><span>aiving all his professional fees and possibly other medical costs involved</span><span>.  The indirect introduction between doctor and patient who were thousands of miles away from each other was made possible through another long time friend of Theresa's,         Dr. Grace Ponce who was herself a cancer patient of Dr. Fitzgerald. She happened to have an appointment for a check up on the day that Theresa was undergoing mastectomy in the Philippines.  Having lived through the devastating effects of the disease herself, Dr. Ponce made a ""side consultation"" about Theresa's case to Dr. Fitzgerald. </span>
</div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span>When cancer strikes, suddenly everything happens so fast. Yet, in many cases like this one, lay the beautiful weaving in the hidden tapestry of a Divine plan.                   </span></div><div><span>I volunteered to live in NJ temporarily to be her full time caregiver for the duration of the chemo treatment. Every single staff at the hospital was very kind and generous with their time and attention from the first day we arrived even though they knew that my friend is not a resident of the US. As if they were all given a heads up and had been briefed days before we arrived.  It felt as though they already knew us beforehand. Dr. Ponce took some time off from her busy schedule to accompany us on the first day.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span>Theresa went back home to the Philippines after completing the five months treatment regimen. It's been a year now since her cancer journey. She is doing very well - a cancer survivor.  Likewise, Dr. Ponce is a cancer survivor for over five years now. In good health, they both recently celebrated their 50th birthday. </span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div>
<span>I personally witnessed</span><span> </span><span>what individual humankindness, like that of Dr. Denis Fitzgerald's and Dr. Grace Ponce's can do to save a life from across the globe.</span><span>  </span><span>Even more so powerful is the ripple effect it created among everyone who selflessly gave of themselves in different ways.</span><span>  This was evident among all the staff at the Hematology Oncology of Central New Jersey, as well as among friends who constantly checked on us, provided some of our material needs, or travelled from other states to visit us. With both of us being strangers to the city and away from our respective homes at the time, the regular outpouring of emails and phone calls helped make our journey a lot less lonely.</span>
</div><div><span><br/></span></div><div>
<span>My direct experience with all the loving kindness from this journey inspired me that I can also help the fight against cancer, as well as help other cancer patients. Can you please help also?</span><span> </span>

<p><b>How the New Products came to be</b><br/></p>In my most stressful work life situation in the past, I developed a severe upper back pain. One day while I was at home alone, lying down almost in tears because of the pain, I had a flashback of some of the natural remedies my grandfather used to make for us for various minor ailments when I was a child. As soon as I started feeling some relief from my back pain, I began formulating my chemistry-based version of natural remedies.<br/><br/></span></div><div><span>I distributed them to all my family members for free. Almost immediately, each one of them was requesting for more and were all giving very positive feedback. They were asking why I didn't share the product with them sooner. And to my surprise they were giving feedback for different minor ailments, more than I had purposely intend to make it for. So I started charging them for their reorders even though at the time, the containers did not have any label at all. I used ziplock bags to put the jar in and a typewritten insert of the product information. All my repeat customers didn't mind. They only wanted more of the product. Unbeknownst to me, they were sharing them with their own circles of friends and started taking orders from those people as well.  Little by little, I was able to use professionally pre-printed labels which I designed myself in order to cut cost from the hourly rate of the graphic artist. It's very satisfying for me to see how its packaging evolved from how it was then to what it is now.  I owe much gratitude to the members of my fortunately big family and circle of friends who were more than willing to try these products at their newly birthed form some years ago. Their generosity in giving constructive feedback and sensible inquiries as consumers are an integral part of the development process . All their unsolicited individual effort to proudly evangelize these products to others will not be forgotten.  And still others have also helped in great many ways.<br/><br/></span></div><div><span>Delivering products that I personally made using only fine ingredients and high quality standards, with the happy customers in mind, is very rewarding. I continued to take orders but only when I had free time to make another batch at a time because I was still doing other things that I also enjoyed. The greatest satisfaction for me was whenever someone shared his story of relief after using the product.  <br/><br/></span></div><div><b>With your financial and other support to help use these products to generate profits for cancer prevention research as well as help cancer patients, I'm sure that the intrinsic rewards we can all gain from taking action will be deeply meaningful.

How it All Began  
Last year, my childhood friend and best friend to this day, Theresa, who lives in the Philippines was suddenly diagnosed with a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer.  Stage 2 Triple Negative. From a simple medical inquiry through email, Dr. Denis Fitzgerald, a very kind oncologist in Little Silver, New Jersey offered to give her the rounds of chemotherapy she needed at an affordable out of pocket cost.  Waiving all his professional fees and possibly other medical costs involved.  The indirect introduction between doctor and patient who were thousands of miles away from each other was made possible through another long time friend of Theresa's,         Dr. Grace Ponce who was herself a cancer patient of Dr. Fitzgerald. She happened to have an appointment for a check up on the day that Theresa was undergoing mastectomy in the Philippines.  Having lived through the devastating effects of the disease herself, Dr. Ponce made a ""side consultation"" about Theresa's case to Dr. Fitzgerald. 
When cancer strikes, suddenly everything happens so fast. Yet, in many cases like this one, lay the beautiful weaving in the hidden tapestry of a Divine plan.                   I volunteered to live in NJ temporarily to be her full time caregiver for the duration of the chemo treatment.

<p>The main challenge we face is
making sure we build a quality product that will stand up to everyday use. We
believe we have built a team of professionals to meet that challenge. We have
been patient and used wisdom along the way and we will continue that approach
as we move forward.</p>
<p>Other challenges include pricing
the Weed Zinger where it is attainable for the end user and sustainable for us
as a company.</p>
<p>A successful Indiegogo campaign will help us to bring the Weed Zinger to market as quickly as possible
and rapidly put the tool in the hands of our supporters. We will jump start manufacturing of the Weed Zinger by crowdfunding the parts and labor for the

</div></div>","The safe and fun way to get rid of weeds! Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. 
The steel constructed Weed Zinger requires no bending, kneeling, or lifting. Using this
eco-friendly tool allows your yard to be chemical free and your hands to stay
clean.  The Weed Zinger grabs the weed and its roots from all types of
soil, even heavy clay without damaging the surrounding turf or ground cover!
Simply aim and ZING the weed at the target some 3-6 feet away.  
The Weed Zinger is the only weeding
tool that shoots the weed directly into a trash can without the need
to bend over to pick-up the extracted weeds. 
Simply step...twist and zing the weed
away. 
   

The
Weed Zinger lawn and garden tool was invented by David Weaver who wanted to
make weeding easier to use.  What he discovered when outside weeding was
that it was a magnet for kids and was actually fun to use.  He showed a
video to me and the company was born!
What we
found was that when the prototype arrived in the mail, I walked outside and my
kids followed me… I was like the pied piper. 
The kids then proceeded to beg me to use it!   Little
did I know that what was easy for adults was actually FUN and a game for kids!  
These are our initial prototypes:


We originally put the spring on the outside of
the device.  When we got the prototype
from the manufacturer, we realized there were quality control issues. 

So, we moved the spring inside the device.

Here is the full picture of this version.

Then, we changed the color and made the handle
more user friendly. 

We then added a handle grip and made the
trigger easier to use for both left and right handed individuals.

This is the version we presented at the 2014
National Hardware Show in Las Vegas.

When we tried the various prototypes, we just couldn’t help ourselves.  We used it for hours and hours and even had to go to other houses to find more weeds!

We worked with an industrial/graphic artist who devised a way to turn the chore of weeding into a game.  He developed this backstop for kids to use while weeding. 

We also had a consumer market research
study done.  They found:

The Cool Gut Buster covers the stomach and love handles, can hold more packs, and makes inducing cold thermogenesis easier.</p><p>One of the big tricks to going into 'Hardcore' intensity is guzzling down ice water throughout your session. Many people can go all the way into all-out shivering just by wearing the CFB and drinking lots of cold water. But what if you want to do an evening session? If you drink that much water, you may have to get up to use the bathroom, disrupting sleep.</p><p>That's why it's helpful to simultaneously wear the Cool Gut Buster; it makes it a lot easier to get cooled down, induce cold thermogenesis and burn lots of calories w/o drinking so much ice water. And the CGB can also replicate the conditions necessary to ""freeze away"" stomach fat, though not officially endorsed or recommended for that use.</p><p> </p><p><b>What is the difference between Soft and Hybrid packs? </b></p><p>Please <a href=""http://coolfatburner.com/question/soft-hybrid-packs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SEE HERE</a> for information about Hybrid vs Soft packs.</p><p> </p><p><b>Can I wear the Cool Fat Burner during exercise? </b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In theory you could. And it might speed up calorie burning, depending on the exercise involved. Having said that, exercise itself will generate heat which will defeat the purpose of cold thermogenesis.</p><p>Even when I do cold-weather walks wearing the cooling vests, I make sure to walk slow and casually, so as to not generate heat via the exercise, but instead via cold adaptation.</p><p> </p><p><b>Why is international shipping so high? </b></p><p> </p><p>Each unit -- a Cool Fat Burner, Cool Gut Buster, or set of packs -- weighs ~ 6-7lbs. A combo deal (all three) will weigh nearly 20lbs. That's why international shipping rates are so steep.</p><p>Please keep in mind, it's actually MORE than what you pay; we take on some of the cost ourselves, usually around ~ 20%.</p><p> </p><p><b>Where do we choose the sizes, packs types, and so on? </b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When the campaign ends, you will receive a questionnaire asking about what sizes and pack types you want.</p><p>Here is the sizing chart off the main site, to give you an idea:</p><p> </p><p> </p><h4>Cool Fat Burner Sizing <i>(Chest Size)</i>

<li>Consult with your physician before use.  Do not use for more than 25-30 minutes unless authorized by your physician.</li>
<li>Keep out of reach of children.</li>
<li>The Cool Fat Burner is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.</li>
<li>Extreme cold, especially from the Hybrid packs, may cause fat cell apoptosis, and spot reduce fat. Women should consider this when using Hybrid packs near the chest area.  (layers of clothing should negate this)</li>
<li>Extreme cold near the skin for extended periods of time can cause cryoburn or even frostbite.  Cold exposure for long periods of time can lead to hypothermia. Use common sense. Seek medical help if you experience any symptoms or health problems.  Discontinue use if experiencing burning and tingling.</li>
<li>Do not place gel pack directly on the skin, use gel packs only in “Cool Fat Burner” and “Cool Gut Buster” fabric vests.</li>
<li>If you are pregnant, nursing, taking medication, or have a history of heart conditions consult with a physician before using this product.</li>
<li>Those with diabetes should not use this product without their physician’s consent.  Not recommended for those with high blood pressure, heart disease, or cardio-pulmonary problems.  Do not use if you have hypersensitivity and allergic reactions to cold or have rheumatoid arthritis with cold sensitivity, any medical conditions related to cold exposure, or have skin sensation problems.</li>
<li>Caution is necessary when applying cold on or near superficial nerves.</li>
<li>Do not sleep or lay in a reclining posture when wearing the Cool Fat Burner or Cool Gut Buster.</li>
<li>Do not use gel packs if punctured; liquid material is biodegradable, dispose of appropriately.</li>

UPDATE:   HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT -- thanks to our backers, our groundbreaking university group experiment is about to be published in the peer-reviewed ""The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness!""  This is amazing news, further proving the effectiveness of the Cool Fat Burner, and is a first ever for any crowdfunding campaign!
Thanks for all your support!
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
The Cool Fat Burner and Cool Gut Buster are the world's first and only proven brown fat, calorie burning cooling vests.  The Cool Fat Burner allows you to burn hundreds of calories an hour while you sit and lounge. 
This means you can burn as many calories JUST FROM WEARING THE VEST, as you would from working out.The first and only calorie-burning cooling vest to show TRIPLE CALORIE BURN:A man of my size would burn ~ 500 calories in 2 hours during this experiment.  (This experiment was conducted at the University of CA, San Diego.  They do not endorse the use of any product or protocol for cold induced calorie burning; results may vary.)  Please read and understand the Disclaimer  at the bottom before pledging and using.First conceived in 2010, the Cool Fat Burner was initially made by hand in my mom's basement.  We've gone on to become the world's leading weight loss cooling vest, the only one backed up by scientific testing and real-user testimonials, making one breakthrough and discovery after another, and we now need your help to take the next big step...  

Goal:  $10,000.  Experiment 1:  Conduct the first ever university group study on the Cool Fat Burner and it's effects on calorie burning along with testing ""Before & After"" of other important health markers and physiological functions. Stretch Goal:  $80-110,00.  Experiment 2:  First ever university group study on the Cool Fat Burner and its effects on weight loss and muscle and strength gains, on college-aged men over a 6 to 8 week period. Rewards:  The Cool Fat Burner, the Cool Gut Buster, our unique cold packs, and fingerless knit gloves.
 
 

The Cool Fat Burner and Cool Gut Buster are specialized cooling vests that cover ""brown fat"" zones on the body, and are designed to burn massive amounts of calories.
 
  

 
 
 

(Both the Cool Fat Burner & Cool Gut Buster are patent pending.) 
(PET scan of Eric's ""brown fat"" being activated from 1 hour wearing the Cool Fat Burner) 
 
 (Sizing chart at very bottom in the FAQ)     
Watch where I burned OVER 2500 CALORIES IN 1 DAY -- as much as running a marathon -- with the Cool Fat Burner and general cold thermogenesis, all verified by university DEXA scans and indirect calorimetry!    It's the same reason how: 
Michael Phelps can eat thousands of extra calories a day, and stay ripped.(the water is cooler than his body temperature, it pulls the heat out, so he burns more calories to maintain body temp)
And how climbers of Mt Everest can lose up to 1/3 of their body-weight in a single day, despite eating sticks of butter!
Scientists in Antarctica and soldiers stationed in Siberia are required to eat 6000 to 8000 calories a day, just to maintain their body-weight.
And why Dr Oz had an audience member stand in a cold shower.  (she didn’t like it!)
The Cool Fat Burner is the only cooling vest shown able to activate calorie-burning brown fat:And the only cooling vest to show that being cold-adapted raises your resting metabolism -- this means you burn more calories at rest, even on days you don't even wear the Cool Fat Burner!You can wear the Cool Fat Burner at different intensities -- Beginner, Moderate, and Hardcore.  Other cooling vests can only function at Beginner intensity, where no real calorie burning occurs -- the Cool Fat Burner can go all the way to 'Hardcore' intensity, where massive calories are burned!     The 3 levels of cold thermogenesis. Only the higher intensities can induce significant calorie burning.How do you control or change intensity levels?  
more or less clothing
room temp
posture
drink ice water during your session
wear both the Cool Fat Burner & Cool Gut Buster simultaneously
increase your cold-adaptation
Please read and understand the Disclaimer at the bottom before pledging and using.No, and there are several reasons why.  1.  First, ""Fingers, toes, ears, & nose.""  Socks, gloves, and a hat are your friends during cold thermogenesis sessions.   2.  Second, the Cool Fat Burner allows you freedom to do what you want, so you keep your mind on what you're doing.  Lounge around the house, watch TV, play video games. 3.  Cold adaptation.  As you become more cold-adapted, you'll actually feel normal in what used to feel like cold temps. (When cold adapted, this doesn't even cause goosebumps)    Goal:  Experiment 1 -- $12,000 - university group study on the Cool Fat Burner's ability to burn calories and effect various other physiological markers
Subjects will give a ""Before"" blood sample to test for various health markers
Subjects will sit at a desk and have their metabolism measured for 15 min  (this will show their baseline energy expenditure – how many calories they burn, just by sitting)
The subjects will put on the Cool Fat Burner and Cool Gut Buster, drink several glasses of water, and be tested with indirect calorimetry (calorie burning) for 20 minutes
The subjects will again drink several glasses of water, and be tested with indirect calorimetry (calorie burning) for the final 20 minutes
Subjects will remove the cooling vests and have the ""After"" blood drawn, to test for differences in the various health markers
 Stretch Goal:  Experiment 2 -- $80,000 to 100,000 - university group study on the Cool Fat Burner's ability to induce fat burning and muscle and strength gains in 12 to 20 college-aged men, over a 6 to 8 week periodSubjects will wear the Cool Fat Burner and Cool Gut Buster for 1.5 hrs a day, 6 days a week, for 6 weeks.  ""Before & After"" DEXA scans (for fat and muscle composition) as well as physical tests (for strength and endurance) will be tested and recorded  I’ve been experimenting with controlled cold exposure for over twenty years.I’ve always loved things that put me “in the moment.”  Athletics, martial arts, meditation, and cold exposure.  And because I loved to lose myself in those activities, I could perform at peak potential and get the best results.I first started taking cold showers in high school.  I loved how you had to “let go” of yourself and be completely in the moment so as to go past the sensation of cold.  Later I started competing in “No Holds Barred” fighting, what is now called “MMA.”  During this period I started doing outside waterfall meditations, again for the serene, clear state of mind, as well as post-workout recovery. I eventually retired from fighting, traveled the country, stopped healthy living.  And got fat.  And then in 2010 I saw this picture:  I had a family history of heart disease and early death.  I knew I had to do SOMETHING.  I heard about people taking ice baths to burn calories… but I was older and wiser now and knew I’d never stick to ice baths or cold showers.  So I jumped online to look for a cooling vest that could do the trick.  Nothing existed, and my first reaction was frustration.  THEN IT HIT ME:  I would make the cooling vest that in that moment I wanted but didn’t exist, and offer it to others with the same goal!  Testing, experimenting, R & D.  My brother and I made the packs in our basement, and I made the first 600 vests myself!  Slowly, the word spread, and people heard about the Cool Fat Burner.   I reinvested every single penny.  We put our reputation on the line, going to an independent, 3rd party university lab, filming the whole thing, and did the original indirect calorimetry experiment that showed the Cool Fat Burner could triple a person’s metabolism.     No one else was doing any of this; we were out there making scientific breakthroughs.  We were the first and only to show you could easily burn 500 calories in a few hours wearing the Cool Fat Burner.   Then it started to snowball.  Experiment after experiment, success after success…  
The Cool Fat Burner was the first. 
A lifelong passion for health, fitness, meditation, maximum performance and top-notch results. 
I've experimented with cold exposure for decades.
I started making the Cool Fat Burner by hand, in my mom’s basement, because nothing else like it existed. (If it had already existed, I would have happily bought it!)  It’s creation was natural and organic, and a labor of love.
We've proven ourselves time and again by putting our reputation on the line, proving ourselves with real, verifiable, independent 3rd party experiments.
Top-notch customer service & the very best in cold thermogenesis knowledge, advice, and breakthroughs.  (see upcoming CoolFatBurnerGuides.com)
Original research, experiments, and discoveries.  We've led the way in cold thermogenesis. 
Our testimonials are all of real users. 
We have professional athletes, fighters, bodybuilders, fitness competitors, and all around champions who wear the Cool Fat Burner.  Our customers are smart, informed winners who demand results.
Everything we do is backed up by real science.  Independent 3rd party experiments, controlled, recorded, and shared for all to see.        The University of CA San Diego tested the Cool Fat Burner against other newcomer vests who claimed to do what only the Cool Fat Burner was already shown to do -- triple metabolism and burn hundreds of calories an hour.Once again we BLEW AWAY the competition!            (This experiment was conducted at the University of CA, San Diego.  They do not endorse the use of any product or protocol for cold induced calorie burning; results may vary.)    World class athletes use the Cool Fat Burner to passively burn ""junk"" calories w/o wearing down their bodies. The Cool Fat Burner is helpful for combat athletes with weight classes. Isaac is a world-class athlete, fitness adviser, and biomedical engineer. He uses the Cool Fat Burner to help passively burn calories as well as help achieve a deeper sleep.  Brian is a former power-lifting champion.  He used the Cool Fat Burner for exercise recovery.Kevin & Katie used the Cool Fat Burner (Kevin also used the Gut Buster) to lose a total of 15lbs in one month, without dieting or exercise! Junior is a life-long combat athlete who used the Cool Fat Burner to speed up calorie burning and recover from workouts.   Karl is a lifelong lifter.  He used the Cool Fat Burner for exercise recovery. Jane uses the Cool Fat Burner to help burn extra calories while she works on the computer. John H. has experienced fast calorie burning with the Cool Gut Buster.   Please read and understand the Disclaimer at the bottom before pledging and using.  All backers get free access to CoolFatBurnerGuides.com (you get your login info when your perk ships)Each Cool Fat Burner & Cool Gut Buster comes with 4 packs by default.  Some perks offer extra sets of packs. You will choose vest sizes and pack types when we send you a questionnaire, goes a day or so after your pledge.(All Perks are shipped 2-3 times a week... we'll send out a sizing survey questionnaire when you order, to gather your sizing information)    FEATURED PERK --1 Cool Fat Burner, 1 Cool Gut Buster, and 1 extra set of packs  -- get total coverage for the best in cold thermogenesis             1 Cool Fat Burner, comes w/ 4 packs. You can choose Hybrid or Soft.     1 Cool Gut Buster. Makes reaching 'Hardcore' level of cold thermogenesis quicker and easier.  Med to X-Lg can all hold more than the default 4 packs.        1 Cool Fat Burner, 1 extra set of packs (you can choose either Hybrid or Soft on both)     1 Cool Gut Buster, 1 extra set of packs (recommended, since Gut Busters can hold more than the 4 default packs)           Please visit out site FAQ here.You can read the Disclaimer at the bottom of any page on the official website. What is the difference between the Cool Fat Burner & Cool Gut Buster?  The Cool Fat Burner covers the brown fat zones and makes contact with a number of major vessels. The Cool Gut Buster covers the stomach and love handles, can hold more packs, and makes inducing cold thermogenesis easier.One of the big tricks to going into 'Hardcore' intensity is guzzling down ice water throughout your session. Many people can go all the way into all-out shivering just by wearing the CFB and drinking lots of cold water. But what if you want to do an evening session? If you drink that much water, you may have to get up to use the bathroom, disrupting sleep.That's why it's helpful to simultaneously wear the Cool Gut Buster; it makes it a lot easier to get cooled down, induce cold thermogenesis and burn lots of calories w/o drinking so much ice water. And the CGB can also replicate the conditions necessary to ""freeze away"" stomach fat, though not officially endorsed or recommended for that use. What is the difference between Soft and Hybrid packs? Please SEE HERE for information about Hybrid vs Soft packs. Can I wear the Cool Fat Burner during exercise?   In theory you could. And it might speed up calorie burning, depending on the exercise involved. Having said that, exercise itself will generate heat which will defeat the purpose of cold thermogenesis.Even when I do cold-weather walks wearing the cooling vests, I make sure to walk slow and casually, so as to not generate heat via the exercise, but instead via cold adaptation. Why is international shipping so high?  Each unit -- a Cool Fat Burner, Cool Gut Buster, or set of packs -- weighs ~ 6-7lbs. A combo deal (all three) will weigh nearly 20lbs. That's why international shipping rates are so steep.Please keep in mind, it's actually MORE than what you pay; we take on some of the cost ourselves, usually around ~ 20%. Where do we choose the sizes, packs types, and so on?   When the campaign ends, you will receive a questionnaire asking about what sizes and pack types you want.Here is the sizing chart off the main site, to give you an idea:  Cool Fat Burner Sizing (Chest Size)

was a Professional Model, and currently runs a Not-For Profit
organization.  This group, <a href=""http://www.iamwhoiamwhoareyou.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Am Who I Am Who Are You</a>, helps kids and teens
who are experiencing bullying in their lives.  As a Model, Mr. Starr
traveled extensively throughout Europe and the United States, growing his
experience in the world and with other people and cultures.  These skills
allow Mr. Starr to be the professional he is today when dealing with other
people and businesses.  As an Entrepreneur, Mr. Starr hopes to run several
successful business ventures, the first being Dart Battles, Inc. </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS DART BATTLES?</b></p>
<p><b>Dart Battles</b> offers Family Fun &amp; Entertainment services to the  Metro Area.  These services will initially be offered through Nerf Dart
&amp; Disk wars.  While similar in effect and environment to the sport of
paintball, these darts and disks do not cause injury or harm to those playing
with them.  This allows for a safe and very fun environment where children
can team up with each other to attack fellow friends or set up competitions to
compete against other groups. But don’t be mistaken, Dart Battles is not only
limited to kids.  Dart Battles is perfect for adults as well as corporate
groups, team building workshops, and numerous other adult oriented activities, <b>NURF
ON!</b></p>
<p><b>What We Need
&amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The company is seeking $80,000 in funding
for the start-up phase and its initial operations. This funding will cover the
purchase of equipment, marketing, lease of property, utilities, and other
miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p><b>Dart Battles</b> will use the latest generations of modern Nerf guns, darts,
and disks.  This will allow kids and families to play with the newest toys
“just seen on TV”, without having to bear the cost of purchasing these items
themselves.</p>
<p>If we meet our funding goal we will be
inviting the top donating family to come
out and play at our new building, plus a free t-shirt with our logo, and they
will also get a shout out on our Facebook page.  If we don't meet goal we
will be donating all the money collected to the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/821247/www.iamwhoiamwhoareyou.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span> I am who i am who are you</span></a> charity.</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Dart Battles will provide complete
Family Fun and Entertainment services in order to meet growing needs and
demands for the younger population. At
Dart Battles, our philosophy is one that emphasizes safe and family focused
alternatives, and a realization that effective communication within the family
element is a key component to our business. The company also realizes that in a
competitive environment, flexibility and professionalism will help maintain
that leading edge. </p>
<p>Our motto is <b>PLAY BY THE RULES OR DO

ME
Mr. Starr is an Entrepreneur who formerly
was a Professional Model, and currently runs a Not-For Profit
organization.  This group, I Am Who I Am Who Are You, helps kids and teens
who are experiencing bullying in their lives.  As a Model, Mr. Starr
traveled extensively throughout Europe and the United States, growing his
experience in the world and with other people and cultures.  These skills
allow Mr. Starr to be the professional he is today when dealing with other
people and businesses.  As an Entrepreneur, Mr. Starr hopes to run several
successful business ventures, the first being Dart Battles, Inc. 
WHAT IS DART BATTLES?
Dart Battles offers Family Fun & Entertainment services to the  Metro Area.  These services will initially be offered through Nerf Dart
& Disk wars.  While similar in effect and environment to the sport of
paintball, these darts and disks do not cause injury or harm to those playing
with them.  This allows for a safe and very fun environment where children
can team up with each other to attack fellow friends or set up competitions to
compete against other groups. But don’t be mistaken, Dart Battles is not only
limited to kids.  Dart Battles is perfect for adults as well as corporate
groups, team building workshops, and numerous other adult oriented activities, NURF
ON!
What We Need
& What You Get
The company is seeking $80,000 in funding
for the start-up phase and its initial operations. This funding will cover the
purchase of equipment, marketing, lease of property, utilities, and other
miscellaneous expenses.
Dart Battles will use the latest generations of modern Nerf guns, darts,
and disks.  This will allow kids and families to play with the newest toys
“just seen on TV”, without having to bear the cost of purchasing these items
themselves.
If we meet our funding goal we will be
inviting the top donating family to come
out and play at our new building, plus a free t-shirt with our logo, and they
will also get a shout out on our Facebook page.  If we don't meet goal we
will be donating all the money collected to the  I am who i am who are you charity.
The
Impact
Dart Battles will provide complete
Family Fun and Entertainment services in order to meet growing needs and
demands for the younger population. At
Dart Battles, our philosophy is one that emphasizes safe and family focused
alternatives, and a realization that effective communication within the family
element is a key component to our business. The company also realizes that in a
competitive environment, flexibility and professionalism will help maintain
that leading edge. 
Our motto is PLAY BY THE RULES OR DO
NOT PLAY AT ALL! 
HERE AT DART BATTLES
WE WORK WITH KIDS BY TEACHING THEM ABOUT HONESTY, TRUST, TEAMWORK

<h2>The PROBLEMS</h2>
<p>It has become harder and harder to find Yoga Instructors who are willing to make these videos without payment. There are tons of people who want to share their knowledge, but time and finances are a major factor on whether or not making these videos is realistic. With your funding, we will have the backing to begin paying instructors at a per video rate. This will benefit everyone! It will help motivate the instructors that we already work with to come back and film more, and it will give us the opportunity to go out and scout for some of the BEST Yoga Instructors in the country, and get them featured on YogaTX!</p>
<p>We lost our studio space...our editor had to move out of his apartment, and it was at his complex that we were able to shoot our videos for free, for so long. Right now, YogaTX is basically going out and filming wherever we can; outdoor shoots, our living rooms, or donated time by local yoga studios. This has slowed down production greatly, and has us with our backs against the wall. But, with your funding we're finally going to be able to lease a little studio! A filming space that we can design ourselves. A space where we don't have to set-up and tear-down our camera/lighting equipment for every shoot, or worry about time restraints. A place that will let us feel a little more grounded, and a humble home to start making more powerful videos :)</p>
<p>We have a solid team of over 10 very dedicated Yoga Instructors &amp; an Editor just ready to come in to a studio and film! The only hurdles standing in the way from us being able to create a self-sustaining entity from our channel, that will provide 150 FREE HD yoga videos a year, FOR YEARS TO COME, are the two above mentioned issues, that can EASILY be remedied with only 1 years funding.</p>

Diagnosed in 2008, at 39 yrs young, with the same rare cancer as Steve Jobs, and given 15 months to live, April has persevered. She put's most of her energy into her 3 young girls, all while having a humorous attitude and zest for life.
April's business as a gifted 'faux finish' artist has significantly declined with her inability to work on a regular basis due to her illness. Being self employed, April did not have health insurance at the time of her diagnosis.
 After having undergone 'Whipple' surgery where doctors removed half of April's pancreas and rearranged her internal organs, April went through having her house in foreclosure, (it's safe now, only behind), her work truck repossessed, and living without air conditioning in the Arizona heat.(her a/c is clunking along for now.)
 Feb of 2010 the cancer reappeared in April's liver. Her cancer has metastasized beyond her liver, removing her from the liver transplant list. The persistent survivor, April is now on new chemo medicine that makes her feel as though she has the flu most days, but she knows that that's because it's working. 
 Though April shines with great hope and joy for life she is gradually losing weight and is still not cancer free.
 Low stress
Your gift not only helps April catch up financially and to relax some, it frees April to focus on her health and build up her immune system. Giving her relaxed time with her children and family, now while she need this most.
 
Your contribution large or small helps an awesome person, giving her time to create a few more lasting memories with her girls.

<p>My name is Tim Hammond and I’ve been working on issues of genital integrity and children’s rights since 1989.

I also have two colleagues who have agreed to chip in free time and interest from a handful of friends. I even have a few testers that are willing to exercise their new found freedom in the backyard once it's ready.$1,032 buys:
FM R/C Receiver
Arduino and Proper Shields
Movement Motors
Working but Used Power-Mower
12v Batteries
Angle-Iron and Square-Tubing
Caster Wheels
Drive Wheels
Rods/Nuts/Washers for Frame
Sprockets & Chain
Electronics Components
Elevation Control Assembly
Countless Screws/Bolts/Supplies
I wouldn't be opposed to supplying an updated shopping and costs list on the updates page if it would make anyone more comfortable with contributing. Any overages will be used to further investigate additional potential.Thank You in Advance!I'd like to thank you in advance for even considering this idea. The possibility of helping others and the room for educational growth on my and my colleagues part is very exciting.If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask. I am just a guy with an idea and believe that I have the knowledge and drive to make it happen.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Introduction:
After being diagnosed with infertility and treated for two years, Uros's parents finally managed to get pregnant and thought that was the end of their troubles. But they were wrong...
The Condition:
Uros was born preterm in 2009. A couple of hours after his birth, he was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which is highly dangerous, even deadly. For a month and a half his parents weren't allowed to visit him because of the strict policy of the Institute of Neonatology in Belgrade. He was receiving a CMV therapy for 47 days twice a day, but the virus began to affect all his organs, leaving him with severe cerebral palsy. Since his brain was also infected, there were high chances of him becoming blind, deaf, dumb or mentally challenged. One can only image the agony his parents were facing.
When he was only 3,5 months old, he had a serious brain surgery due to enlarged brain ventricles and just when the family thought the agony would soon end, 20 days after the first operation some complications occurred and he had to undergo another one.
Treatments: 
Uros has undergone three surgeries so far (in 2010 in Belgrade, and in 2011 and 2012 at the Stammzellen clinic in Vienna). The first time he had a shunt placed and the other two involved a stem cell therapy. Now he's able to hold his head up, he regained some motor control in his right arm and, most important of all, he's sane and understands everything. But there's so much fight ahead of him. 
Funding Goals: 
Another two operations in the pipeline for 2013 and 2014 and follow-up treatments, especially the Therasuit therapies, should enable him to sit on his own, use both of his arms, talk, and, ultimately, walk. That's when he and his parents will actually begin to live normally.
But this chance for better life has a cost - USD 45,000, which is the amount they need to make those two surgeries and treatments happen and to buy necessary vitamins and nutritional supplements.
The Mission:
This family has been and will be fighting with all their hearts. If you can, help them win the fight. If you know someone who can help too, please spread the word.

</p><p>Dear family and friends,</p>
<p>This July 31st to August 9th 2014, I will serve as a
volunteer on a Hands Across The Americas Medical mission in Cuzco, Peru. As you
know I am from Lima, Peru and it has been my lifelong dream for me to go back
to my home country and give back to those who are in need of some of the basic
things we here in the U.S. may take for granted. What better way to give back than
by doing what I love doing the most, Nursing. During this mission, we will
provide health care where people have little or no medical assistance. Many
will be traveling long, rugged roads to obtain these services. Please join me
in contributing to provide these services that are much needed on a daily
basis. Help me help others and make a difference. I want to assure you that
100% of all donated funds will be used towards medical supplies, medicine and
equipment but most importantly, will help make a difference in their overall health
and enforce preventative measures. I know not everyone may be able to help
financially but you can still help me by spreading the word.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance from the bottom of my heart!</p><p>Here's the link to Hands Across The Americas: <a href=""http://www.handsacrosstheamericas.org/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.handsacrosstheamericas.org/index.html</a><br/></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Polina Reynolds and I have been diagnosed with Maxillary hyperplasia and Mandibular hypoplasia (Class II malocclusion or improper tooth alignment).  Surgery promises to correct this functional growth deformity and resolve at least some of the associated symptoms. This condition requires Orthognathic (jaw) surgery to correct it (LeFort I Osteotomy on top and Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy on bottom). This surgery will help me achieve my goals and I hope this website can reduce the financial burden. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why: My reasons for the surgery are:</p>
<p>1)<span> Stop the chronic and significant pain in my jaw and neck, which also contributes to regular migraine headaches.</span></p>
<p>2) <span>Prevent tooth damage and loss, as well as more general breakdown of jaw function.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I received the surgery July 23, 2013, am recovering well, and am now gathering donations to be able to pay the bills when they arive. You may view before/after X-rays in gallery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More Info: For years, I have suffered from migraines and continuous jaw and neck pain. Due to my constantly tight jaw and neck, talking or standing for long periods of time is challenging and causes pain to extend to my upper back and remain for days afterward. My muscles have compensated somewhat for this improper tooth and skeletal alignment; they are constantly tight to bring my lower jaw into more proper alignment with the top when I chew. Yet this solution is neither sustainable nor complete, my teeth slide every time I bite down and I exert substantial effort to bring them together. Due to this ‘posturing’, my jaw muscles are constantly tense and painful. <span>This compensation, tension, and pain extends to my neck and upper back muscles</span>. <span>At night, I end up sleeping with my mouth open and my neck contorted into an awkward position to relieve some of the built up tension.</span> Prior to the recent braces, I wore a bite splint almost continuously for 2 months to assess the alignment of my jaw without posturing. During this time, my jaw muscles shrunk dramatically in size and my neck pain somewhat subsided, convincing me that jaw surgery would relieve my pain.</p>
<p>Even though my posturing and tooth sliding allows me to eat, I continue to bite down and chew with only a few teeth in my mouth (without braces, this was one molar pair on either side of my jaw). Jaw muscles that are stronger than usual due to constant compensation + biting that causes pressure to be concentrated on only a few molars = eventual tooth breakdown requiring crowns/root canals and leading to additional pain and loss of function. I have been told by every specialist I saw that surgery is the only way to avoid tooth problems and the sooner I get the surgery, the better.</p>
<p>History: I wore braces and various appliances for 5 years (from age 12 to 17) as a potential alternative to jaw surgery when it was discovered that my bite was improper. Wearing braces helped me be able to eat normally for the first time, such as being able to bite an apple (only my back teeth met so I had to either bite everything with my molars or cut food into smaller pieces prior to eating). However, bite and jaw problems came back within a couple of years of braces removal (<span>(I am not sure if they ever went away; whatever the braces corrected was superficial and failed to address the underlying structural problem</span>). According to an oral surgeon I saw, this is a sure sign of an unstable bite. Before deciding on this course of action, I was evaluated for splints and more conservative bite adjustments but found to have too severe of a problem for these methods to work. My condition is most likely genetic and early x-rays indicate the improper alignment of the skeletal structure of my jaw. </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Cost:</p>
<p>Surgery: 15,400 (includes both surgeon fees and temporary splint)</p>
<p>Braces: 4250 (thanks to amazing generosity of my orthodontist and paid in monthly payments)</p>
<p>Pre-braces splint: 1500 (to evaluate severity of misalignment without muscle tension and posturing)</p>
<p>Anesthesiologist:  2160 - 864 (40% off for paying before surgery) = 1296 </p>
<p>Facility fee: 4911 - 1227.75 (25% off for self pay on day of procedure) = 3683.25</p>
<p>Titanium implants/plates: 5444 (for 40)</p>
<p>X-rays/Records: 300</p>
<p>Insurance coverage: 50 (covered portion of x-rays)</p>
<p>Total out of pocket cost: 31,823</p>
<p>Insurance coverage considers this a non-covered condition except on rare occasions, deeming it cosmetic unless I suffer from severe sleep apnea or can’t eat (no consideration of the prognosis, which suggest such problems are almost certain to arise if not prevented). The insurance company has denied my claim (refusing to cover even the facility and anesthesiologist fees) even after the doctor provided records confirming medical necessity. All five doctors I saw (2 orthodontists, 2 oral surgeons, and 1 prosthodontist) deemed orthognathic surgery necessary to improve my bite, reduce pain, and prevent tooth breakdown in 10-20 years (due to hitting on only one tooth on either side without braces on).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have chosen to self-pay for the surgery due to the recovery being quite lengthy (6 weeks short term and 6 months long term) and thankfully having the time and health to have this surgery now. Any donations will greatly assist in paying for this life-changing surgery. My mother works part-time as a phlebotomist at a private hospital (with ‘great’ insurance that won’t cover the procedure) while I just graduated from college with student loans. In addition, my sister will be attending college in a couple of years, so our financial situation is very tight.</p>
<p>I have been working an extra job to be able to save for the surgery. I have paid for several expenses (necessary downpayments for surgery to happen) with my credit card but have now maxed it out. I need help paying for the rest of the expenses. Any amount will help. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>I completed a BS in Molecular and Cellular Biology and have taken Calculus 2, Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, and most biology classes. I have taught/tutored math and science to middle/high school and college students and am offering online tutoring sessions for your donations. Please let me know what you are interested in. </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>I just graduated from University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) with degrees in Psychology, Analytic Philosophy, and Molecular Biology. I plan on pursuing further education and will be applying this fall to begin Fall 2014. I have an average amount of Federal student loan debt even after Pell Grants and hope to avoid significantly increasing this amount with credit card debt from medical expenses. As a first generation immigrant, money has always been tight in my family and we have no savings to be able to afford the surgery. Your assistance will allow me to more freely pursue my educational goals without worrying about paying bills until I complete my education (thanks to deferment available on my student loans). Thank you and I appreciate all of you! </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Please spread the word whether or not you can donate. With your help, I can reduce the debt I have as a new college graduate. </p>

As a first generation immigrant, money has always been tight in my family and we have no savings to be able to afford the surgery. Your assistance will allow me to more freely pursue my educational goals without worrying about paying bills until I complete my education (thanks to deferment available on my student loans). Thank you and I appreciate all of you! 
Other Ways You Can Help
Please spread the word whether or not you can donate. With your help, I can reduce the debt I have as a new college graduate.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

we made our first successful “moon landing” by completing 238,857 miles. Along

<li><p>In 2014 our Moon Jogger mission is called <a href=""http://www.moonjoggers.com/voyage-to-venus-benefiting-little-heroes-foundation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Voyage to Venus</a> and our goal is to run approximately 25 million miles to Venus. Along the way we hope to raise

<h3>My story</h3>
<p> My name is Cecilia Auth and I have been a pediatric nurse for over 17 years, I've worked with many children who have required tube-feedings through their gastrostomy tubes.  Accessing the port can be very disruptive to a child, especially while sleeping. I have seen parents and other medical personnel struggle while attempting to access a child's G-Tube. This lead to my TUBESIE creation!  It is my goal to help make the feeding process much more bearable for children and their dedicated parents. We currently have demo Tubesies being used on babies  at the hospital I worked at for almost 6 years, and also have shared demos with families in their homes.  I am excited to say we have received positive feedback from all families! I'd like to share one of them with you:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Testimonial:</strong></h3>
<p>Meet Riley, she has been putting her TUBESIE to the test! She gives it a thumbs up! Riley enjoys wearing her TUBESIE while reading, playing and sleeping. It has allowed her to remain comfortable and happy during the times when Mom has accessed her G-tube.  This is what Mom had to say: </p>
<p>""TUBESIES CHANGED THE WAY WE LIVE! WITH OUR OLD BODYSUITS WE WOULD HAVE TO UNDRESS OUR DAUGHTER COMPLETELY IN ORDER TO FEED HER. NOT ONLY DO TUBESIES OFFER EASY ACCESS, THE AREA IS KEPT CLEAN WITH THE GAUZE!"" </p>

<h3>What will we do with the funds:</h3>
<ul>
<li>purchasing material</li>
<li>manufacturing</li>
<li>labeling</li>
<li>distribution to private individuals &amp; hospitals</li>
</ul>
<p>My dream is to be able to share Tubesies with every family in need of better access to their child's G-tube. Also, to share with medial personnel that care for children with feeding tubes.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, we would be grateful if you would consider sharing our link with those you are connected with via social media.  It's as simple as clicking the logos above!</p>
<p>Thank you ALL for taking the time to learn about my passion in helping children, parents and medical personnel!  I look forward to a successful campaign, so that we can quickly begin to help make families' lives a little bit easier! One TUBESIE at a time!</p>

 My name is Cecilia Auth and I have been a pediatric nurse for over 17 years, I've worked with many children who have required tube-feedings through their gastrostomy tubes.  Accessing the port can be very disruptive to a child, especially while sleeping. I have seen parents and other medical personnel struggle while attempting to access a child's G-Tube. This lead to my TUBESIE creation!  It is my goal to help make the feeding process much more bearable for children and their dedicated parents. We currently have demo Tubesies being used on babies  at the hospital I worked at for almost 6 years, and also have shared demos with families in their homes.  I am excited to say we have received positive feedback from all families! I'd like to share one of them with you:
 
Testimonial:
Meet Riley, she has been putting her TUBESIE to the test! She gives it a thumbs up! Riley enjoys wearing her TUBESIE while reading, playing and sleeping. It has allowed her to remain comfortable and happy during the times when Mom has accessed her G-tube.  This is what Mom had to say: 
""TUBESIES CHANGED THE WAY WE LIVE! WITH OUR OLD BODYSUITS WE WOULD HAVE TO UNDRESS OUR DAUGHTER COMPLETELY IN ORDER TO FEED HER. NOT ONLY DO TUBESIES OFFER EASY ACCESS, THE AREA IS KEPT CLEAN WITH THE GAUZE!"" 
-  Christina S. , New Hampshire 
 

What will we do with the funds:

purchasing material
manufacturing
labeling
distribution to private individuals & hospitals

My dream is to be able to share Tubesies with every family in need of better access to their child's G-tube. Also, to share with medial personnel that care for children with feeding tubes.
Other Ways You Can Help:

Thank you ALL for taking the time to learn about my passion in helping children, parents and medical personnel!  I look forward to a successful campaign, so that we can quickly begin to help make families' lives a little bit easier! One TUBESIE at a time!
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
Tubesie Supporters:
Tiffany Krumins is the CEO, founder and inventor of Ava the Elephant, children's medicine dispenser.  She was the first person to strike a deal with Barbara Corcoran on the ABC TV show "" The Shark Tank""!  I've had the amazing opportunity to be mentored by her.   She has helped me bring Tubesies to life!

<h3>The Technology Behind the Campaign</h3>
</div>
<p>While access to clean and affordable drinking water is considered by many as a human right, nearly <strong>1.2 billion</strong> of the world's poorest people, those earning US $2 a day or less, are without adequate water services and access to safe drinking water.  Drinking water, free of bacteria and pathogens (<strong>the number one cause of water related illness and death globally</strong>), is a human right that should made available to everyone affordably. </p>
<p>Many organizations are trying to provide some of the world's poorest communities with access to clean water, but long-term success needs to be a unified and multifaceted response.  This is why CATIS-Mexico, a Mexican-based non-profit, has joined in the fight to provide a low-cost solution for clean water access through the realization of <strong>ceramic water filters.</strong></p>
<div>Ceramic water filtration is being used around the globe as an inexpensive answer to potable water concerns. However, not all ceramic water filters are created equal. Engineers at iCATIS, one of CATIS-Mexico’s main partners, designed a ceramic water filter that is low-tech, affordable, low-maintenance, and can be made and distributed internationally.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>One system using local materials and labor retails at $30-40 and will purify water for a family of 6 every day for 2-3 years.</strong></div>

<div> </div>
<div>The filters are made with local materials found anywhere in the world, namely: clay, sawdust (or similar material), and a small percent of colloidal silver (which is readily and inexpensively found in most markets).  The filters are fired in an ecological brick-kiln designed by iCATIS engineers (which reduces emissions by upwards of 80%) and can produce, on average, approximately 24 liters of water/day.  To put this into perspective, CATIS filters can reduce the cost of potable water from $0.10/liter to approximately $0.001/liter, or <strong>100 times less expensive</strong> than the cost of standard drinking water in Mexico.  </div>

</div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>I am looking to raise <strong>$2500</strong> for CATIS-Mexico in order to ramp up the production of filters and start the local distribution process.  The longer it takes, the more severe the groundwater depletion problem in the state of Guanajuato becomes. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Large agricultural producers are using disproportionately limited water resources which contribute to the overdraw of groundwater and increasing levels of arsenic and fluoride in the drinking water.  <strong>Your donation will </strong></span><strong>help place these filters into homes sooner.</strong>
</div>
<p>And So...</p>
<p>This Valentine's Day, consider giving someone the gift of water.  Your contribution will be directly impacting the health of economically vulnerable families who cannot afford to buy clean water. </p>
<p>In return for your generous donation, you'll receive some extra PERKS that will hopefully sweeten the deal (pun intended).  All of these will be made by YOURS TRULY as a small token of my appreciation for your generous support.  Although Valentine's Day is here, the campaign will run until March 22nd: World Water Day! </p>
<h2>Further Impact</h2>
<p>CATIS-Mexico sees the ceramic water filter not only as appropriate technology, but as an opportunity to create micro-businesses as well.  Working with local community groups, CATIS-Mexico is developing methodology to create local economic opportunities.  Long-term development of micro-enterprise opportunities for local communities include:</p>
<p>1)     In-home filter molding businesses,</p>
<p>2)     Community-based system maintenance and/or assembly businesses,</p>
<p>3)     Filter distribution,</p>
<p>4)     Filter replacement exchange program, and</p>
<p>5)     Increased economic opportunities for local brickmakers in the burning of raw filters.  </p>

</span></p><p>Over the past two years
one of the most influential activities has been Slacklining and all the
fruitful lessons it has taught me. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Slacklining exudes some very simple concepts that are easily relatable to life. What exactly is slacklining?  A slackline is a one inch piece of webbing stretched between two points with which one balances upon, walks, and poses. It takes an indescribable amount of focus and effort.  When on the line there is a complete disconnect with everything and at the same time just the opposite. The movement of the line, the movement of your body, and of your mind are all centering and simplifying. One empties their mind and becomes a fluid force with one's environment. It's about balance, breathing, and centering. It's meditative, physical, reflective, and connective. Here are some links that might help explain. </span></p>

<p>Slacklining has taught me how slow down in life and become centered with my environment. It has showed me patience, balance, discipline, and peace. There's something special about being encompassed with practice in something so pure and beautiful such as slacklining while being surrounded by something so pure and beautiful such as Nature. </p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">My Campaign</h4>
<p>I wish to journey across the West from Arkansas to the coast and back stopping at as many National Forests, Parks, and Monuments along the way. Throughout this journey I hope to spread exposure and knowledge about slacklining and it's valuable lessons to as many individuals as possible. I hope to influence others to find more simplicity, balance, peace, and grounding in their lives through slacklining and Nature as the most efficient tools. I hope to expose others and myself to the Natural beauties our phenomenal Nation has to offer and learn as many lessons as possible.  I have been searching for a journey as such for my whole life and now is probably the best time for me to accomplish it. I hope to come out of this experience with a greater value and understanding for life.</p>

<p>I graduated with a BA in 2010 and have since then waded about in various conquests for money to pay off the debt my education has supplied me and at the same time be as satisfied with my existence as possible.

<p>All the <b>actual</b> costs of the trip is what I'm trying to raise.

<p>Help me spread knowledge and understanding through simplicity. Help me teach others to be more in touch with their environment, with themselves. Help me spread importance of centering, grounding, and reflective/meditative peace. Help me experience a journey of a lifetime. Help me learn more about myself. Help me experience the Natural beauties this Nation has to offer while at the same time aiding others in sharing the experience. I understand if you can't contribute financially (hence the campaign). But, simply sharing my goal with others could also be a big help. Indiegogo is good with helping you share. <br/></p>

Me 
Hello Friends! My name is Shelby Matussak. I just want to laugh, love, and make good art. I believe myself to be a Passionate and Creative individual. There are many things I am passionate about and these passions have a direct relation to my existence and it's fulfillment. Most of my passions are related to creative expressions. There is a sublime essence to an individual's freedom in natural creativity. The reward for such expression is one of great self accomplishment and often actualization.  Most of my passions also involve the outdoors and all it's delights. I achieve an incredible insurmountable amount of bliss through Nature's unsurpassed beauty and offerings. Being in touch with my natural planet physically and emotionally reciprocates an internal euphoria that allows me to enjoy my existence more fully and peacefully. I believe that all can share such ideals through Nature and it's rewards. 

Over the past two years
one of the most influential activities has been Slacklining and all the
fruitful lessons it has taught me. Slacklining exudes some very simple concepts that are easily relatable to life. What exactly is slacklining?  A slackline is a one inch piece of webbing stretched between two points with which one balances upon, walks, and poses. It takes an indescribable amount of focus and effort.  When on the line there is a complete disconnect with everything and at the same time just the opposite. The movement of the line, the movement of your body, and of your mind are all centering and simplifying. One empties their mind and becomes a fluid force with one's environment. It's about balance, breathing, and centering. It's meditative, physical, reflective, and connective. Here are some links that might help explain. 
A news piece on Highlining in Moab, UT
Slackline Yoga, Centering, Relaxing, Peace. 
Some Highlining at Smith Rock 
Skyliners
Slacklining has taught me how slow down in life and become centered with my environment. It has showed me patience, balance, discipline, and peace. There's something special about being encompassed with practice in something so pure and beautiful such as slacklining while being surrounded by something so pure and beautiful such as Nature.

<span style=""font-size: 36px; line-height: 40px;"">Introducing Strahlen</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>As filmmakers and photographers, we're constantly trying to do one thing - make our work better. And in doing so, we want to be using the best tools possible. This could be an updated camera body, or a new tripod, or - lights.</p><p>We've noticed a big problem in the lighting industry - people want LED lights, but everything on the market tends to be too expensive, poorly made, or difficult to modify.</p>
<h3>Strahlen is the solution.</h3>
<p>We began work in December of 2012 to create a new, high-output LED light made using three overarching principles:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Durability</li>
<li>Value.</li>
</ol>

After nearly a year of developing, prototyping, and testing, we've created our first product - the ST-100 series. The ST-100 is unparalleled in its versatility and quality and offers some of the best value on the market. Let us introduce you to the Strahlen ST-100 and show you why it needs to be the next light in your arsenal!

<p>
</p><h3>Chimera Mount (add $75)</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/262991/files/20131216002414-Chimera.jpg?1387182254"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>The Chimera 6.5"" mount attaches to the front of the ST-100 and gives you the best of both worlds - high quality Chimera modifiers and budget-friendly S-type modifiers, all in one light. The ability to modify the look of the ST-100 is practically limitless!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>Dome Diffuser (add $60)</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/262998/files/20131216003055-Dome.jpg?1387182655"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Turn the ST-100 into a bare bulb light! This add-on is perfect for photographers who are used to working with bare bulb strobes, or for anybody looking to create a smooth, 180 degree spread of light. The dome simply attaches on the front by using magnets - there's nothing to twist or screw, just pop it on and pull it off.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F4y1LLW6CYw8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4y1LLW6CYw8&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F4y1LLW6CYw8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a2b78eb2d12f45f9a400a7341cc8e511&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p>
</p><h3>Fresnel (add $100)</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/262994/files/20131216002601-Fresnel.jpg?1387182361"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>This fixed-distance Fresnel lens narrows the beam spread down to ~60 degrees - allowing you to throw the light from the ST-100 while maintaining excellent output. Just like the dome diffuser, the Fresnel attaches using magnets and is simple to use.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FxF7bOMBNuh8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxF7bOMBNuh8&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FxF7bOMBNuh8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a2b78eb2d12f45f9a400a7341cc8e511&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

</p><h2>Our Plan</h2>
<span style=""line-height: 0.25em;""><a href=""#top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(top)</a></span>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We're coming to the Indiegogo community with a finished product that is ready for manufacturing.</p>
<p>We've spent the past year building relationships with our manufacturers and suppliers, researching and testing every component, and taking the ST-100 out into the field to determine and resolve any usability and reliability issues. Through all of this hard work, we've developed the ST-100 into a product that we confidently stand behind.</p>
<p>If we meet and exceed our goal, we'll be able to produce enough units to not just meet our demand on Indiegogo but also deliver additional demo units to distributors and rental houses across the nation, making the ST-100 readily available to creatives everywhere.</p>
<p>We'll be able to travel to shows across the US (we're lookin' at you, NAB!) and get Strahlen in front of even more awesome people.</p>
<p>And, most importantly, we'll be able to invest even more time and money into improving the ST-100. We believe that we have an incredibly strong base to launch Strahlen, but without your support - we have nothing.

Improved ST-100
We made some modifications to the ST-100 and have removed ~4"" from the length and ~2lbs of weight!

Introducing Strahlen

As filmmakers and photographers, we're constantly trying to do one thing - make our work better. And in doing so, we want to be using the best tools possible. This could be an updated camera body, or a new tripod, or - lights.We've noticed a big problem in the lighting industry - people want LED lights, but everything on the market tends to be too expensive, poorly made, or difficult to modify.
Strahlen is the solution.
We began work in December of 2012 to create a new, high-output LED light made using three overarching principles:




Flexibility
Durability
Value.


After nearly a year of developing, prototyping, and testing, we've created our first product - the ST-100 series. The ST-100 is unparalleled in its versatility and quality and offers some of the best value on the market. Let us introduce you to the Strahlen ST-100 and show you why it needs to be the next light in your arsenal!

Add-Ons
(top)


Chimera Mount (add $75)
The Chimera 6.5"" mount attaches to the front of the ST-100 and gives you the best of both worlds - high quality Chimera modifiers and budget-friendly S-type modifiers, all in one light. The ability to modify the look of the ST-100 is practically limitless!


Dome Diffuser (add $60)
Turn the ST-100 into a bare bulb light! This add-on is perfect for photographers who are used to working with bare bulb strobes, or for anybody looking to create a smooth, 180 degree spread of light. The dome simply attaches on the front by using magnets - there's nothing to twist or screw, just pop it on and pull it off.


Fresnel (add $100)
This fixed-distance Fresnel lens narrows the beam spread down to ~60 degrees - allowing you to throw the light from the ST-100 while maintaining excellent output. Just like the dome diffuser, the Fresnel attaches using magnets and is simple to use.


Strahlen on Set

We've been testing out the ST-100 on several productions in a variety of mixed-light environments. Here's a quick video highlighting a few of the productions that the ST-100 has been used on.On the set of Coder God | Directed by Scott Wenger | DP S. Allman

Our Plan
(top)


We're coming to the Indiegogo community with a finished product that is ready for manufacturing.
We've spent the past year building relationships with our manufacturers and suppliers, researching and testing every component, and taking the ST-100 out into the field to determine and resolve any usability and reliability issues. Through all of this hard work, we've developed the ST-100 into a product that we confidently stand behind.
If we meet and exceed our goal, we'll be able to produce enough units to not just meet our demand on Indiegogo but also deliver additional demo units to distributors and rental houses across the nation, making the ST-100 readily available to creatives everywhere.
We'll be able to travel to shows across the US (we're lookin' at you, NAB!) and get Strahlen in front of even more awesome people.
And, most importantly, we'll be able to invest even more time and money into improving the ST-100. We believe that we have an incredibly strong base to launch Strahlen, but without your support - we have nothing.



Ways You Can Help

My wife Barbara and I have spent our adult lives helping others, now sadly we have to turn to others for help. We have put this off for so long thinking it would get better and we would catch up. Unfortunately things just continue to get worse. </p>
<p>I started my working career at the age of 15. Once I got that 1st pay check I felt I could never make enough money. I've always worked 2-3 jobs including owning my own business and working as a volunteer firefighter/paramedic. Working in EMS was my all time favorite thing to do. For 8 or so years I was dealing with low back pain that I tried to ignore until 2011 when I just couldn't take the pain any longer. I went to a few surgeons that all suggested I have a fusion done of my L-5 S-1 vertebra. Sep 12th 2011 was the day I had the surgery and the day my life had changed for ever. I cannot go into detail at this time, but I ended up having a total of 8 back surgeries and approximately 80 days in the hospital. I'm now fused from L-4 S-1 with metal cages on the back of my spine and 1 on the front that they put in going through my abdomen. </p>
<p>Around surgery #6 I was home and became deathly ill. I honestly felt like I was dying. My wife rushed me once again to the emergency room. I knew on the way to the hospital that I probably had developed blood clots in my lungs (pulmonary embolisms) from a picc line that was placed in my arm to self administer antibiotics. Sure enough I had a CT study done and my lungs were full of blood clots. My wife and I broke down in tears. Out of all the times during this whole ordeal that I felt like I was dying, this was the real deal. </p>
<p>I spent most of those 8 months taking steroids. Around surgery # 7 and my 9th MRI my surgeon noticed that I had developed avascular necrosis ( dying bone) of my femoral heads and to stop taking the steroid immediately. I was told that it had progressed to the point that I was looking at 2 more surgeries to fix both hips. My wife and I once again crying our eyes out said to each other, there is no way we were emotionally ready for that. I was told by my orthopedic doc that I would have 6 months to a year max before they collapse. We decided to roll the dice and see if I could put it off for a year. The doctor just sad good luck and don't jump off of anything to avoid collapse. </p>
<p>One year to the month I started to develop horrible pain in my right hip area. I went to my ortho doc and an x-ray confirmed that my right hip had gotten worse and would need surgery asap. 4 days later I'm back in the operating room having my 9th surgery. A 9mm hole was drilled into my femur to bore out the dead bone of my femoral head then replace the area with bone graft. </p>
<p>Two weeks after the surgery I started feeling the same pain in my hip. At my follow up appt I mentioned this pain and it was ignored. A week later the pain was off the charts. I emailed my surgeon to let him know and the email was intercepted by a nurse that pretty much said to suck it up. A few days later I went to see my primary and demand an x-ray which in fact confirmed a fracture. Surgery # 10 coming soon.</p>
<p>Two years ago I never knew to much about depression because I've had and worked my ass off for everything and anything I ever needed. I have the best wife and the best kids one could ask for. I have ALWAYS felt like I was on top of the world. Now I'm flat broke and cant walk. I have racked up well over a million dollars in medical bills and setting up meetings with food shelves. How does this happen?? </p>
<p>My wife is working like crazy to try and keep us a float and not lose our home. It kills me to see her work so hard while I sit here everyday barley able to help with simple things around the house.</p>
<p>We cry and just hold each other asking ourselves, what did we do to deserve this? We have always gone out of our way to help others, bent over backwards to make sure everyone was happy and had everything they needed. We use to have more friends then we use to know what to do with. Now it seems everyone has gone away. Maybe because they don't know what to say...I don't know?</p>

<p>Five year old Cadence Ogden of East Royalty, Prince Edward Island was diagnosed at the age of two with a rare genetic disorder called Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.  This inherited disorder can cause liver disease.  Cadence's Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency has advanced far more quickly than expected.  She is now in liver failure.</p>
<p>Her liver is greatly enlarged and not able to do its' work.  This makes her tummy swell and causes her pain and discomfort.  She has periodic nose bleeds, nausea and vomiting and she tires more easily.  Her smile though is as big as ever and so is her spirit.</p>
<p>These past three years have been difficult ones for Cadence, her parents Corey and Crystal, and big sister Mariah.  There have been many trips to the QEH and the IWK and most recently to Toronto Sick Kids.  Cadence needs a new liver and is on the transplant list there.  The expected date for the transplant is unknown but could happen at anytime.</p>

<p><strong>How your donation will help the family.</strong></p>
<p>All funds raised will be given to the family to help with the expenses before, during, and after the liver transplant.  Cadence has a doctor appointment at Toronto Sick Kids in October.  Her parents are hoping to be tested as possible donors during that visit.  That process takes a week.  The costs associated with this trip include the airfare for the three of them, accommodations for the week, meals, transportation, and lost wages that her parents may have.  </p>
<p>The bulk of the expenses will occur during the transplant.  They expect to be in Toronto for 4-5 weeks.  One parent will need to purchase airfare to and from Toronto, accommodations for the 4-5 weeks, meal, transportation, and lost wages. </p>
<p>From Toronto, Cadence will be airlifted to the IWK in Halifax and spend a few weeks there.  Again, the cost of meals, accommodations, transportation, and lost wages. </p>
<p>When Cadence returns home, one of her parents will need to take time off work to care for her for a few months.  Again, more lost wages.  Cadence will be on a lot of medication and the cost for that will add up quickly.  </p>
<p>If one parent is a donor match then the expenses will increase a lot more.  </p>

</h3>
<p>A - This campaign was not aimed at offering pre-orders, because
if we did so you will have had to wait more than a year to receive your device.
We thoughts it was to much waiting. That's why we set-up this first campaign as
a way to get your feedback and as a preparation for a second campaign with
pre-orders that will be launched in less than a year.</p>
<p>Q -<b> Will the device be truly portable/mobile?</b></p>
<p>A - Yes, absolutely! The device dimensions will
be around 10 cm long, with this particular boomerang shape
(see prototype picture) given by the technology optical path. We will try to
update the campaign with some ""artist concept"" of the device design.</p>
<p>Q - <b>Will it be just yet another device restricted to
healthcare professionals?</b></p>
<p>A - Absolutely not! The device will be possibly used by
healthcare professionals, because of the unmet need it satisfy; but it will
be principally aimed at mass-market. Our goal is to transfer the
diagnosis/analysis capacity from hospitals to the general public.</p>
<p>Q - <b>Will the price of the device be
tentative, prohibitive or affordable?</b> </p>
<p>A - Great question. For the moment, it is too soon to anticipate
a retail price for the device. Anyhow, what we can assure is that the device is
being developed focusing on mass-market needs and economic capacity. So be
sure it will be affordable, and potentially (depending on countries) covered by
social security, at least in part.  </p>
<p>Q - <b>Could the device be used by non healthcare
specialists?</b></p>

A -
Yes, absolutely! The device is being developed in order to be used by anyone
without any specific knowledge in medicine. If you are familiar with
glucometers (for diabetics), the principle of use will be the same. A single
droplet of blood, obtained by finger-stick, is sucked up by capillarity in a disposable
test-strip and the device do the rest.<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p>

<strong> </strong>My name is Joshua Amorelli. I am originally from Wisconsin, but currently I live in Georgia working for THE BEST  aviation company (Gulfstream Aerospace) there is. I served in the Air Force for 10 years honorably as a Jet Engine Mechanic. I have always lived a relatively activities oriented kind of life. I love to go out and spend time on the water with my Jet Ski, go lift weights or run 3-6 days a week, and engage in a myriad of other activities in which I would enjoy my life and get out of the house. That all changed about two years ago. In  November of 2012 I got really sick. I mean really sick. For two weeks and a couple of doctors visits, I  had severe flu like symptoms, difficulty walking, trouble sleeping and an unexplained rash on my right bicep. At the time I was running and trimming down and feeling really good about myself. After my sickness I continued my health and workout regimen, but with little results. Honestly I really didn't feel like I had fully recovered. My ability was drastically diminishing at breakneck speed. I used to run Forsyth park in Savannah Ga at least three times a week. I would run 3 miles at a relatively sow pace, and do anywhere between 2 to 4 miles running intervals. Along with that I was also working out at a gym alternating days to keep from over training. I do not  lift heavy, my regimen was more low weight high reps to trim. Two months after being sick, I could  no longer do it. Things were so bad that after working my regular 3 day weekend schedule, I had to crawl from my bathroom to my bed (approximately 3-4 feet) simply because I was so exhausted and my legs simply couldn't do it. I was spending 8 to 10 hours a day in my bed on my days off, simply because I could not get myself out of bed. I still have to fight myself to get out of bed, and go to class and try to stay relatively social. My current doctor/hormone specialist has dealt with my issues in a way that have allowed me to be a little more functional, but now even those treatments are starting to have little to no effect. On a chance reading, my doctor read about a case of Lyme Disease, and immediately thought of my case and the fact we couldn't find a diagnosis that fit my ever increasing symptoms. She came to me about 2 months ago asking me if I remember having a rash or if I had had contact with a  tick. I told her about my initial sickness before things started getting bad, and she suggested I have a lyme test done. Since then I have had another test, and both have markers that are consistent with lyme disease. My next course of action is to see a lyme literate doctor and hopefully start a treatment plan that will get me back to the guy I once was. <p>The money you donate will go directly to the office of Doctor Kalidas, a Lyme literate doctor located in Orlando Florida for my treatment plan. In the event I do get a job in Wisconsin, the money will go to the office of Dr. Steven Meress at the Fox Valley Wellness Center in Fond Du Lac WI. The problem with most lyme literate doctors is they do not usually take insurance. In the case of Dr. Kalidas' office, I have to pay to be seen upfront, and the initial interview is $395  dollars with treatments ranging from $60 a session to $270 a session. I can handle the logistics, getting there and securing a place to stay is easily attainable. Its the out of pocket expense that I have a problem with. I have spent a significant amount of money just getting a diagnosis that financially the burden of out of pocket expenses are too much. I can petition to have the insurance company reimburse me, and in that event I will be wrapping that money back into continued treatment until my issues are resolved. Any left over money will be donated to Lyme disease fund because that is the only right thing to do if I get a clean bill of health with money left over. </p>
<p>This Campaign is important to me because with your help I can become the person I once was. My health is failing me at an incredible pace, and if it is definitely Lyme disease, the sooner the treatment the better.  I have many of the symptoms consistent with stage two and three lyme disease to include extreme cramping, extreme fatigue, arthritis like symptoms in most of my major joints, numbness on the left side of my face, poor memory, swelling of my joints (particularly my knees), bouts with extreme vertigo,  and weakness in all of my extremities. The longer they go unchecked, the worse they can get and more issues will start to manifest. Please share this with any and everybody you can, and know you will forever have my gratitude if you so choose to help me. God bless and thank you. </p>

Honestly I really didn't feel like I had fully recovered. My ability was drastically diminishing at breakneck speed. I used to run Forsyth park in Savannah Ga at least three times a week. I would run 3 miles at a relatively sow pace, and do anywhere between 2 to 4 miles running intervals. Along with that I was also working out at a gym alternating days to keep from over training. I do not  lift heavy, my regimen was more low weight high reps to trim. Two months after being sick, I could  no longer do it. Things were so bad that after working my regular 3 day weekend schedule, I had to crawl from my bathroom to my bed (approximately 3-4 feet) simply because I was so exhausted and my legs simply couldn't do it. I was spending 8 to 10 hours a day in my bed on my days off, simply because I could not get myself out of bed. I still have to fight myself to get out of bed, and go to class and try to stay relatively social. My current doctor/hormone specialist has dealt with my issues in a way that have allowed me to be a little more functional, but now even those treatments are starting to have little to no effect. On a chance reading, my doctor read about a case of Lyme Disease, and immediately thought of my case and the fact we couldn't find a diagnosis that fit my ever increasing symptoms. She came to me about 2 months ago asking me if I remember having a rash or if I had had contact with a  tick. I told her about my initial sickness before things started getting bad, and she suggested I have a lyme test done. Since then I have had another test, and both have markers that are consistent with lyme disease. My next course of action is to see a lyme literate doctor and hopefully start a treatment plan that will get me back to the guy I once was. The money you donate will go directly to the office of Doctor Kalidas, a Lyme literate doctor located in Orlando Florida for my treatment plan. In the event I do get a job in Wisconsin, the money will go to the office of Dr. Steven Meress at the Fox Valley Wellness Center in Fond Du Lac WI. The problem with most lyme literate doctors is they do not usually take insurance. In the case of Dr. Kalidas' office, I have to pay to be seen upfront, and the initial interview is $395  dollars with treatments ranging from $60 a session to $270 a session. I can handle the logistics, getting there and securing a place to stay is easily attainable. Its the out of pocket expense that I have a problem with. I have spent a significant amount of money just getting a diagnosis that financially the burden of out of pocket expenses are too much. I can petition to have the insurance company reimburse me, and in that event I will be wrapping that money back into continued treatment until my issues are resolved. Any left over money will be donated to Lyme disease fund because that is the only right thing to do if I get a clean bill of health with money left over. 
This Campaign is important to me because with your help I can become the person I once was. My health is failing me at an incredible pace, and if it is definitely Lyme disease, the sooner the treatment the better.  I have many of the symptoms consistent with stage two and three lyme disease to include extreme cramping, extreme fatigue, arthritis like symptoms in most of my major joints, numbness on the left side of my face, poor memory, swelling of my joints (particularly my knees), bouts with extreme vertigo,  and weakness in all of my extremities. The longer they go unchecked, the worse they can get and more issues will start to manifest. Please share this with any and everybody you can, and know you will forever have my gratitude if you so choose to help me. God bless and thank you.

seconds faster in my 500m, 14 seconds faster in my 1,000m, 7 seconds faster in my 1,500m, and I skated
a 3,000m, the longest distance women skate in competition, for the first time!  And I’m on track to continue to beat my own
times next season. 
But as happy as I’ve been with my progress this
season, I’ve also had a few bumps in the road. 
Having type 1 diabetes means that I have to get off the ice during
practices to test my blood glucose and eat a snack if I’m low.  This season it also meant I had a race where
I had to stop skating because my sugar was too low.
At the end of the season the technical director of
my team decided that a diabetic skater ""didn’t fit the profile of an athlete"" they’d like to have.  The team I was so proud to be a part of no longer wanted me.
It would be easy to be discouraged, but I’m
fortunate to have people who believe in me. 
People like my coach, who refused to ask me to leave the team, and was
eventually fired.  And all of my
teammates, who quit the team and are now training with me and my coach as part
of a private team.  They’ve backed me
up.  And now I’m hoping you’ll do the
same.  
MY GOAL
I dream of going to
the Olympics, but more than that, I dream of being the best speedskater I can
possibly be.  Most people don’t realize
that the majority of aspiring Olympians and Olympic athletes are self-funded. 
This year with the money I’ve saved from teaching learn to skate I estimate I
will still need $3,750. Your help will make it possible for me to
achieve my goal.   
TIMELINE
My ice fees and first
payment to my coach are due the first week in September. With your help I will
be able to start the season and train through the end of May.
YOUR GIFT
By supporting me you
are helping me to achieve my dream of representing our nation at the Olympics
in 2018. Your contribution of any size will help to make this possible
and is greatly appreciated. You don’t have to donate at a
""perk"" level... it may not seem like $1 would make much of a
difference, but it really does. $10 buys new springs for my clapblades, an essential piece of equipment in longtrack.$15 buys one time trial.  I have time trails every Saturday during the season.$25 helps pay for equipment maintenance for summer training.  Off-ice training is where skaters gain most of their time for the ice season.$50 pays for blade maintenance (rocking and bending).  Keeping my blades in shape helps me to keep contact with the ice.$75 pays my entry fee for AmCup, Nationals, and other competitions$137 buys half a month of coaching with a coach who believes in me.$275 buys one month of coaching with a coach who believes in me$500 pays for a new skinsuit.  Mine has holes in it and needs to be replaced.$1,000 pays for all of my ice time for the season.PERKSEveryone who makes a donation gets a handwritten thank you card.Individuals donating $25 or more get a jar of Becca's Speed Skatin' Marmalade.  Handmade by Elroy Butterfields, this marmalade tastes like an insanely delicious apple pie.  Elroy Butterfields is a locally owned company that uses homegrown and locally sourced produce in its products.Individuals donating $150 or more get a handcrafted animal from Ocean Sole.  These animals are hand-crafted from discarded flip-flops that have been collected from coastlines and waterways in Kenya.  Ocean Sole products save the environment and support local artisans.Individuals, Corporations, or Organizations who donate $500 or more can have their logo placed on my skinsuit for the season.
After you have made your donation we will request a print quality file of your logo.  Logos must meet USSPeedskating guidelines for acceptability. (i.e. no profanity)  Skinsuit will be worn at practices and in all competitions during the season.

<span><span>I've been stupid enough to sign up to do a Tough Mudder on the 26th October.  For those that don't now, a Tough Mudder is a 12 mile assault course  that involves 20 obstacles with names such as Arctic Enema, Electric Eel and Dirty Ballerina. All obstacles are designed to challenge you and test your determination and basically knacker you out. Those of you that know me will know I love my biscuits and cakes, dislike exercise and moan if I get just a little wet. This therefore represents quite a challenge for me and I want to ask you to sponsor me in the name of a good cause.<br/><br/>My 7 year daughter Scarlet goes to Bishops Down School and in her class is Malachi who finds everyday challenging. Malachi is a cute little 6 year old boy from Tunbridge Wells who has a genetic condition 
called neurofibromatosis. This is a condition which manifests 
differently in each individual, he was diagnosed at birth as his father 
&amp; 2 of his brothers also have the condition.<br/><br/>By
 14 months old Malachi was not crawling or developing properly so  his family contacted the neurologist. 2
 weeks later his family had the phone call they had been dreading and one they never
 thought they would ever get! The hospital told them Malachi had a large 
Bilateral extensive Optic Nerve/Chasm Glioma (brain tumour) and he 
needed to go on urgent Chemotherapy to save his sight. They
 were hopeful of saving Malachi's sight but sadly 6 months into treatment (
 which brings it's own complications such as blood transfusions, low 
neutrophil's and a lot of in patient stays as he was very poorly, and 
hair loss) he lost his sight in both eyes.<br/><br/>By
 Christmas 2010 just a month before his 2 birthday he went completely 
blind he also lost all light perception. He continued the treatment in 
hope of now shrinking the tumour as the sight was no longer an issue.<br/><br/>Malachi's
 tumour did not shrink either, by the end of his 18 month weekly 
treatment the chemo had stopped it from growing any bigger so it was now
 stable.<br/>.<br/>Sadly in
 2013 Malachi developed Hydrocephalus where he had to be rushed in for 
emergency surgery where they performed a drain and he had a 
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt fitted. In 2013/2014 Malachi had to have 3 further brain surgeries due to shunt failure which is scary in its self.<br/><br/>Sadly
 in October 2014 Malachi's family found out the Tumour had started growing again and treatment 
will need to be started now. Malachi has another scan on the 24th of November to
 decide what chemotherapy course will be started. <br/><br/>Malachi
 is a bubbly (and extremely lively!) little boy who is achieving in life
 despite the tremendous difficulties he faces every day. I want to

he has the same opportunities to succeed as anyone else as he goes through school and with the latest news  we want to start fundraising for his bucket list.<br/><br/>His family have a fund called Malachi's Journey and this is who I want to raise money for. They
 have been able raise enough to purchase 2 braillers for the school and have donated a

<h3>Just good friends - Chasing a dream</h3>
<p>To truly understand what we are doing, you need to understand who we are. We are three friends from different walks of life, but with one common passion, we love the art of mixology and bar service. In fact, we love it so much that we started a company called Mix It Up Craft Cocktails to offer bar catering for weddings, parties and events. We offer clients the chance to serve their guests one-of-a-kind handmade cocktails, fun and exciting wines, and unique craft beer choices. This desire for freshness and quality has led us to make our own liquor infusions, bitters, and fresh juices. We only use the best ingredients, because we only want to make the best drinks possible.</p>
<p>The craft of mixology has grown to the point that you can find signature drinks in establishments ranging from TGI Fridays to your local craft bar.  We at Mix It Up are inspired by this movement and want to bring it from the bar to your own events and ultimately your home, where you can mix your favotite spirit with our mixtures for your friends.  This passion we have for feshness and quality has led us to where we are now: making and bottling our own hand-crafted mixes.</p>
<p>It is our goal to grow the initial line of mixes from gourmet Bloody Mary mixes to a line that includes all natural mixes for mojitos, screw drivers, twisted mimosas and many other mixes that allow you to enjoy mixology quality drinks in your home.</p>
<p> The funding will allow us to take it from our kitchen and canning it ourselves to have it bottled professionally and provide it to major restaurants, bars, and stores all over the east coast.  Several significant businesses have already expressed interest when we are able to manufacture more to meet demands.  Having the ability to produce more mixes in less time will allow our business to grow and take a shot at major retailers.</p>

April 12th, 1996

What if you bought Yahoo stock on April 12th, 1996, when it launched? It was valued at $1.08/share, and four years later it was at $118/share. If you sold it then, you would have made A LOT of money.
What's the point?
One of the ""perks"" for contributing is the option of owning a share in our company, and though we know we are not Yahoo, we do think we can capitilze on the mixology trend and grow to offer more than 20 different types of mixes, sold in retail locations, bars, and restaurants everywhere.
Today, we are three guys stil working our day jobs, but we hope to take this passion and make it our life's work.
We have invested all we have at this point and need assistance to get to the next level. The money will help us to move our production from our humble kitchen to a professional manufacturing facility 2 miles from our home.
The amount we need is $15,000 and its use will be as follows:

$10,000 for the first production run
$5,000 for marketing and collateral
 
A hand full of give me and a mouthful of much obliged.......

<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">Force, power, velocity. Decades of research in sport science have established that these three metrics lay at the core of strength training. PUSH is the first fitness device that allows you to track and analyze these metrics, ensuring that your training is optimized.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">How does it work? PUSH tracks how your body is performing at a certain weight and provides insights to help you optimize the load. Not moving the bar fast enough? Lower the weight. Not showing signs of fatigue two sets in? Change the weight.  PUSH allows you to push your body to its true potential, using meaningful metrics, and get stronger over time while minimizing the chance of injury that can set you back.</p></span><p></p>

    PUSH will take your training to the next level. You can also plan your training program, track your progress over time, and share it with friends. Using PUSH, you'll get more out of your training. </span></p>

Our device produces comparable results to force plates, an advanced research tool used by sport scientists to conduct studies, on athlete performance. Force plates cost thousands of dollars and require significant know-how to operate; our device only costs $149 and is easy to use.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-size: 17px; font-family: Sans-Serif; line-height: 1.4; margin-bottom: 26px;"">We're currently in contact with several world-renowned sport scientists who have expressed interest in collaborating on research studies using PUSH. We're thrilled by the results so far and look forward to working with researchers in the field of strength training. If you're a sport scientist who is interested in working with us on testing PUSH, please get in touch with us at info@pushstrength.com</p>

Force, power, velocity. Decades of research in sport science have established that these three metrics lay at the core of strength training. PUSH is the first fitness device that allows you to track and analyze these metrics, ensuring that your training is optimized. 
How does it work? PUSH tracks how your body is performing at a certain weight and provides insights to help you optimize the load. Not moving the bar fast enough? Lower the weight. Not showing signs of fatigue two sets in? Change the weight.  PUSH allows you to push your body to its true potential, using meaningful metrics, and get stronger over time while minimizing the chance of injury that can set you back.




PUSH does more: use your iPhone or Android
    device to create or download routines, or just walk into the gym and train.
    You set your training goals and PUSH provides feedback on your movement.
    PUSH will take your training to the next level. You can also plan your training program, track your progress over time, and share it with friends. Using PUSH, you'll get more out of your training. 




""PUSH is hoping to add some professionalism to what is essentially an amateur space."" – Techcrunch
""New fitness tracker helps athletes push their limits at the gym."" – Mashable
""PUSH has gained interest from dozens of top-tier athletes, trainers, and teams in the NFL, NHL, MLB, European soccer leagues, and MMA leagues. But if you lift weights and want to ensure that you’re lifting them the way you should, PUSH will help keep you on track."" – Greatist
""Knowing your strengths, weaknesses and limits at the gym can be tricky [...] That's where PUSH, a brand new wearable fitness monitor, comes to the rescue."" – Askmen




Whether you train alone or with
    a coach, PUSH has you covered. Press GO to start training or use a
    scheduled routine, PUSH will start tracking what matters.




PUSH detects reps, sets and extract, from each rep, scientifically-validated metrics that can tell you if you're lifting too much or too little. You can gauge your performance based on the velocity of each rep or your peak power output. These metrics have been utilized for decades by elite athletes to gauge their performance improvements over time. Now, it's your turn.



Training isn't as much fun alone: share your routines with friends (and enemies). Wear your badges and new personal records. Display your achievements with pride - you earned them.



Planning an athlete's regimen in
    spreadsheets can be a real pain. The PUSH Portal is the perfect solution to
    help you better manage, track, and optimize your client's training whether
    they're training at the gym or on the road, in-season or off-season.

We've tested the output of our device against some of the leading tools available for sport science researchers and our initial results look great (see for yourself below). Our device produces comparable results to force plates, an advanced research tool used by sport scientists to conduct studies, on athlete performance. Force plates cost thousands of dollars and require significant know-how to operate; our device only costs $149 and is easy to use.

We're currently in contact with several world-renowned sport scientists who have expressed interest in collaborating on research studies using PUSH. We're thrilled by the results so far and look forward to working with researchers in the field of strength training. If you're a sport scientist who is interested in working with us on testing PUSH, please get in touch with us at info@pushstrength.com











With PUSH, the app is completely free and accessible
    via Android and iPhone apps. You can even download the app and use it as a
    manual entry fitness tracking app.

After PUSH ships, we'll be adding optional portal
    access to trainers and athletes at a small premium. Some of the perks on
    the campaign include free and limited subscription to this portal service.
    Updates to the app and portal are always free. 
















We currently have a working prototype and we're now
    focused on: 


 Miniaturizing the electronics and design of the enclosure
Testing usability of our mobile app
Adding more exercises to our database


   We will soon begin the process of: 


Finalize production run designs

Getting consumer electronics certifications

Tooling, packaging, and production






We've been working on PUSH for a year and we've come a
    long way. We need your support in helping bring PUSH to the millions of
    athletes that rely on subjective methods of tracking training. With your
    help, we can build a community around PUSH that is passionate about data,
    sport science, and improving their strength in an efficient and safe
    manner. 

So why should you support us? 

Be the first to get one.

Take your training to the next level.

You are passionate about strength training and want to improve your performance.
