<h2>WE DID IT!</h2>
<p><strong>We successfully reached our goal of $100,000 with 3 hours left in our campaign! Thank you to all of our funders who helped us reach our goal!</strong> Be expecting to receive an email by the end of the business day on Friday, August 3rd asking you to specify your color and/or shirt size. If you are in a restricted area, we will give you the choice of diverting shipping to an unrestricted area or gaining a full refund. You can expect to receive your Yellow Jacket in mid to late October! We are very grateful for the overwhelming positive support and are very happy at how well received Yellow Jacket has been, and once again send a sincere <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to our funders who made our dream of protecting you possible! </p>
<p>If you want a Yellow Jacket and didn't get one during our campaign, you can go to our website and sign up for our mailing list and we will let you know when and where you can get yours.</p>

<h2><strong>UPDATE (July 26, 2012): LAST CALL (ATTACK!)</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We are on pace to reach our goal of $100,000! </strong>If we reach our goal we will become the <strong>8th most funded Indiegogo campaign of all time!</strong> By reaching our goal, not only will we be able to fulfill our pre-orders, but we will also be able to begin R&amp;D on the iPhone 5 and Android Yellow Jacket models as well as bring all development in-house! Please share Yellow Jacket with your network and tell everyone you know who wants one to purchase now and help us protect you! </p>
<p><strong>Our campaign will end July 31 at Midnight</strong> (Eastern Standard Time). After our campaign ends, we will send an email to all funders thanking them for their contribution and asking them to specify their color/shirt size. If you would like to purchase a Yellow Jacket post campaign before they are available in stores, you will be able to do so via our direct website:</p>

<p>----------</p>
<h2><strong>UPDATE (July 21 2012): THANK YOU!</strong></h2>
<p>We have reached our minimum goal and are pleased to announce production <strong>WILL BEGIN</strong> upon the completion of our campaign! We will send an email post campaign to our funders thanking you guys for your help and <strong>asking you to specify your color, </strong>so do not worry about selecting it when you order.</p>
<p>We will also refund anyone who has ordered a product to a region that is restricted. (Although we originally listed Canada, we are unable to ship Yellow Jacket to Canada currently due to legal restrictions. We apologize and hope we can soon protect Canadians as well). Yellow Jacket can be taken to airports, but it must be checked in your luggage and not carried in a carry on. We have spoken with Homeland Security and they verify that this device can be checked in baggage but not carried through screening. </p>
<p>Finally as a thank you and to demonstrate Yellow Jacket in action, we leave you with this jewel - co-founder Sean Simone shocking co-founder Seth Froom during their pitch presentation: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pizRlEXvbdc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pizRlEXvbdc</a></p>

The case contains a 650K volt stun gun capable of taking down an attacker. Yellow Jacket also has it's own external battery, capable of giving the smartphone up to 20 ADDITIONAL HOURS of standby BATTERY LIFE.<br/><br/></p>

<h1>SAFETY FIRST</h1>
<p>While creating this product, we realized that this would be a device people would place next to their face. Because of this, CREATING A SAFE PRODUCT WAS THE NUMBER ONE FOCUS OF OUR DESIGN TEAM. Yellow Jacket features a safety switch and a rotating electrode cap, both intended to prevent accidental discharge. In less than a second, a user can disable these safety mechanisms by moving the switch forward, rotating the cap downward and then be ready to press the activation button to fire the electrodes and be prepared to confront an assailant. The smartphone is securely snapped into Yellow Jacket's inside housing assembly, and the rubber sleeve then wraps around the device, giving Yellow Jacket a smoother look, feel and added protection to your smartphone.</p>

<h1>USABILITY</h1>
<p>Yellow Jacket is charged through the same charging cord as the matching smartphone model. The first Yellow Jacket model is for the iPhone 4 &amp; 4S, so in this case, an iPhone phone charger could be plugged into Yellow Jacket. As previously stated, Yellow Jacket is capable of extending your smartphone's battery life by up to 20 additional hours. A switch on the bottom is capable of alternating Yellow Jacket's battery from standby power of the stun gun to actively powering the smartphone. Also by switching this device to powering the iPhone and plugging the device in, the iPhone can be charged without requiring removal from the device.</p>
<h1>SIZE &amp; WEIGHT</h1>
<p>The size and weight of Yellow Jacket was of second most concern behind the safety features of the product. Yellow Jacket is very comparable in size to an Otter Box Defender or Mophie Juice Pack. Coming in around 1"" in thickness, it adds another 3/8"" in heighth and nothing in the form of width. The device weighs approximately 4 ounces, and when coupled with an iPhone comes in at 8 ounces, keeping the device impressively light. Overall, Yellow Jacket in no way hinders a user from one handed operation or extended periods of time holding the device.</p>

<h1>EFFECTIVENESS</h1>
<p>When the time comes, Yellow Jacket must work and must be effective. We have designed Yellow Jacket to work in an intense, life threatening situation. The shock Yellow Jacket delivers is incapacitating and capable of inflicting pain and injury, but the effects are temporary and a victim will recover in a matter of minutes. We have also designed Yellow Jacket to be out of sight and out of mind unless that situation. Simply put, <strong>Yellow Jacket is there when you need it, and safely stored when you don't.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h1>SHIPPING INFO</h1>
<p>Your Yellow Jacket defense case is scheduled to arrive in early September. We appreciate your patience during this pre-order phase of our business. If there is a way to produce and ship them to you sooner than September then we will find a way to do it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>COLOR SELECTION &amp; SHIRT SIZE</h1>

<h1><strong>THANK YOU!</strong></h1>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<div>
<p>1)      <strong>Will there be future Yellow Jacket models that come out for other iPhone or Android smartphones?</strong> Yes, we are excited to announce that following the launch of the iPhone 4 model we will develop, produce and sell Yellow Jackets for the iPhone 5, HTC Evo and Samsung Galaxy. Other models will surely follow.</p>
<p>2)      <strong>Are stun guns legal?</strong> For most of the United States and World, Yes! With that said there are certain states/countries that prohibit the sale and use of stun guns. Please review the list we have displayed before shipping your Yellow Jacket to a prohibited area.</p>
<p>3)      <strong>Are their certain venues that don’t allow stun guns to be carried on premises?</strong> Even in states that allow stun guns, please be mindful of airports, courthouses and other venues that are prohibit electroshock weapons. While travelling through a public airport, you will be required to check your Yellow Jacket into your checked bag and retrieve it at your destination.</p>
<p>4)      <strong>Will this device actually protect my phone? </strong>Yes! We have designed this product to serve two purposes for its owner: 1) protect the owner and their assets 2) protect the phone from damage. Don’t go getting any crazy ideas like going swimming with your iPhone 4. The Yellow Jacket’s primary purpose is not water resistance but impact resistance combined with a self-protection device.</p>
<p>5)      <strong>Are there safety features on this device that will prevent small children from accidentally discharging the device and injuring themselves?</strong> Yes, there are two distinct safety features on the Yellow Jacket that are designed to stop a child from tampering with the.  First is the safety switch on the side of the device that must be turned off before the device becomes active. Second is the Yellow Jacket safety cover that slides up and over the electrodes when you are not in a situation in which you feel threatened and may need to use the Yellow Jacket. We encourage all of our customers to educate all of their family members about their “new iPhone case” and the pain it can cause if tampered with.</p>
<p>6)      <strong>Can I stun my ear while I am on a phone call?</strong> If used properly, the Yellow Jacket should not come in contact with any part of your body while on a phone call. Because stun guns have to essentially make contact with the skin in order to shock a human we designed the device to face up and away not down and in. The safety cover should also prevent unintentional shocks from occurring. There are always exceptions that we cannot account for. Please be mindful that this is not a traditional iPhone case!</p>
<p>7)      <strong>If I engage the Yellow Jacket’s stun gun feature during a phone call will I lose the call? </strong>We have tested our prototype for this type of interference over the last few months and to our knowledge the answer is NO. There are always exceptions when it comes to technology, but the electricity produced by the Yellow Jacket does not seem to interfere with cellular or wi-fi signals. We will continue testing the product as each new model is released.</p>

UPDATE (July 26, 2012): LAST CALL (ATTACK!)
We are on pace to reach our goal of $100,000! If we reach our goal we will become the 8th most funded Indiegogo campaign of all time! By reaching our goal, not only will we be able to fulfill our pre-orders, but we will also be able to begin R&D on the iPhone 5 and Android Yellow Jacket models as well as bring all development in-house! Please share Yellow Jacket with your network and tell everyone you know who wants one to purchase now and help us protect you! 
Our campaign will end July 31 at Midnight (Eastern Standard Time).

UPDATE (July 21 2012): THANK YOU!
We have reached our minimum goal and are pleased to announce production WILL BEGIN upon the completion of our campaign! We will send an email post campaign to our funders thanking you guys for your help and asking you to specify your color, so do not worry about selecting it when you order.
We will also refund anyone who has ordered a product to a region that is restricted. (Although we originally listed Canada, we are unable to ship Yellow Jacket to Canada currently due to legal restrictions. We apologize and hope we can soon protect Canadians as well). Yellow Jacket can be taken to airports, but it must be checked in your luggage and not carried in a carry on. We have spoken with Homeland Security and they verify that this device can be checked in baggage but not carried through screening. 
Finally as a thank you and to demonstrate Yellow Jacket in action, we leave you with this jewel - co-founder Sean Simone shocking co-founder Seth Froom during their pitch presentation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pizRlEXvbdc

We need all the help we can get. If we will pass this goal we would be able to put more features to it, such as let you choose its back color (black, white or silver) instead of making it all in only one color - solid black.If it goes as we hope we’ll be able to make an improved model with a small pad so you'll be able to draw on it with the touch screen stylus pen. We are adding some cool and unique perks for all of you who are hopefully going to make it all happen. Get your own ""COOL - K"" a week before it even goes to stores and for a lower price. Meet us in person and add your signature for being one of our most break through funders.For Another Cool Examples..*You can create your keys on your gaming keyboard to be animated and change for example the ""w,s,a,d"" keys into running warriors, animated swords, dragons and bring what you like to life.*When water, juice or any liquid is spilled on the keyboard, you can just wipe it off and there will be no damage to the keyboard.*You would be able to write much faster on your computer using apps like swift key and hopefully we will make it possible for you to draw on your computer using the stylus pen. The ImpactThe ""COOL-K"" is going to be affortable for each and every home. Estimate price in stores $149.99We will be able to write our work much faster (just like we have swift key and other writing apps on our smartphones) or even put different icons on your keyboard that you have created so just by tapping them you will easily access the application you wanted.Gamers will be able to reach a much better performance by improving their coordination, resizing keys, adding or removing them within the keyboard as needed. So the keyboard that you created will fit perfectly to your hand proportion and movement.Everyone would have his own cool and unique keyboard. They will be able to add animation to them, download different themes or even create a keyboard with only symbols on it. This is where your creativity and imagination take place.The COOL-K battery is going to last up to 30 hours when fully charged. you can charge it throght your computer, so you wouldn't have to stop using your compter when the COOL-K battery is low. You Can Also Help By...* You are welcome to ask us questions or give us your support.*Every donation counts!

<p><br/></p>
<p>HERE IS AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE DEVICE WORKS.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Baby Alert Car Seat Alarm – Smart Car Seat (BACSA) is
the solution to the problem. The BACSA is an electronic device, and/or a Smart
Car Seat that converts from a car seat to a stroller/baby carrier, designed to
sense the presence of a baby or child placed or secured in a car seat; and
alerts the driver of the vehicle once the vehicle is stopped, the engine turned
off, and the key is removed from the ignition, that a baby or child is secured
in a car seat in the vehicle.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by a sensor of some sort (pressure,
infrared, photo cell, or any other sensing device) place in or installed on the
car seat and/or vehicle. Once the baby or child is placed and secured in the
car seat, the sensor senses the pressure of the baby or child, sends a signal
to the control circuit that activates the device once the ignition is turned on
If the ignition is not turned on with three minutes (or a predetermined set
time), the control circuit will automatically activate the BACSA-Smart Car
Seat. If the ignition is not turned on within ten minutes (or a predetermined
set time), or if the ignition is turned on and the driver has travelled to
his/her destination and turns off the ignition, the BACSA-Smart Car Seat will
activate an internal flashing light and sound and internal alarm (buzzer,
beeper, siren, voice speech, or any other sounding/alerting device) to alert
the driver that a baby or child Is secured in a car seat within the vehicle.
Then, after five minutes (or a predetermined set time), and external alarm will
sound. This is accomplished by the control circuit sending a signal to a siren
(mounted to produce a sound outside of the vehicle, i.e. under the hood), or a
signal from the control circuit can be sent to the vehicles horn relay to
produce the outside alarm; and/or the control circuit will transmit a signal to
a remote device such as a key receiver, pendant receiver, bracelet receiver, or
any other receiver. Further, the </p>
<p>BACSA – Smart Car Seat can trigger an alarm or alerting
device instantly after the presence of a baby, child or person, secured or
unsecured in the vehicle once the internal temperature of the vehicle reaches a
preset dangerous level.</p>
<p>Finally, if all else is ignored, the BACSA – Smart Car
Seat can be interfaced with an outside monitoring service. This monitoring
service would receive an uplink signal or signal indicating that an endangered
baby, child or person is secured or unsecured in a vehicle, then the monitoring
service can notify the proper authorities.</p>
<p>If at any time during the sensing stages of the BACSA -
Smart Carr Seat, if the baby or child is removed from the car seat, the
alerting/alarming state would be discontinued and the device reset.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Back in or around the year 2006, I found myself extremely
bored with not much to do; therefore, I picked up a magazine to read and pass
the time. After thumbing through a few pages in order to find something of
interest, I found my attention fixed on a woman who seems to be in great pain,
I made this assumption because of the facial expression that she exhibited. The
woman was holding her stomach with both of her hands, she was pregnant and due
to deliver the baby soon based on the size of her stomach. At this point, my
interest in reading the article had peaked; therefore I read it. The cause of
the woman’s pain was not due to her current pregnancy, the woman was suffering
from the loss of her first child. She lost her child accidentally abandoning
the child secured in a car seat in a car. The authorities had charged the woman
with the death of the child; however, because it was an accident, the woman was
only sentenced to only probation.</p>
<p>In the article, the woman expressed her sincere regrets
for the mistake and loss of her child. Also, she was greatly concerned and
worried of she would make the same mistake with her unborn baby, she feared
that such a tragedy could easily happen to her again.</p>
<p>After I finished reading the article, my heart melted.
Although I have not lost a child in this manner, I could somehow feel the
grieving pain of this young mother. I then thought to myself, “How could such a
tragedy be prevented from happening again?” I am an computer engineer by
background; therefore I immediately began to think of possible electronic
devices that could be beneficial and help prevent this type of tragedy from
happening to others. I finally conceived a device that could provide such a
benefit, I called this device the Baby Alert Car Seat Alarm – Smart Car Seat
(BACSA). In the year 2011, I filed the initial Provisional Patent Application.
Then, in 2014 I filed a second Provisional Application.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>I know you cannot all fund this project and I do not expect you to give what you do not have.

<p>Farlight Explores is a 3D space-sandbox game, made for space exploration, science fiction, resource management and action fans. In this game you can build your colony or spaceship, explore the galaxy, fight against other enemy factions, commerce and more...</p>
<p>When you start the game you choose a planet to start from the hundreds out there in the galaxy map. Once on the planet you have to extract resources to begin building a colony that provides you with the items to survive like food and others. If the colony is secure, you can start building your spaceship to go to other planets to extract unique resources that you need to develop new technologies, or you can also use your spaceship to attack pirates, or trade with friendly factions or discover buried secrets.</p>

<br/><p>The game is playable, the core is done, if you back the campaign you could play the pre-alpha, but I'm only a programmer and I have no idea of Conceptarts or 3d Design (I did the 3d models and well you can notice that it needs to be better), </p>
<p>So the game is in a point that it needs professional help and this people has to be paid in order to do a good job. I contacted with several professionals of the sector in order to get an idea of an overall cost of the game and I estimated that I could need about 15.000 dollars.<br/></p>
<p>I will use the funds to <b>Improve Game Graphics</b> and <b>Increase the Immersion</b> of the player.</p>
<p>Each 3d asset cost around 80 dollars, right now the game has around 60 assets, that is a total amount of 4800 dollars . I didn't include future assets and the character so the cost would be more. Each concept art is around 400 dollars, I think 10 concept arts should be enough in order to get a global idea of the game, so that is 4000 dollars . The sounds/music I estimated over 2500 dollars. The licenses of the engine is about 1000 dollar. And the rest until the 15.000 dollars could be used to unexpected events.<br/></p>

When you start the game you choose a planet to start from the hundreds out there in the galaxy map.

Some Concept Arts with some ideas of the future Style of the game



Detailed Building Concept Art

Current Graphics



Why Farlight Explorers needs your support?
The game is playable, the core is done, if you back the campaign you could play the pre-alpha, but I'm only a programmer and I have no idea of Conceptarts or 3d Design (I did the 3d models and well you can notice that it needs to be better), 
So the game is in a point that it needs professional help and this people has to be paid in order to do a good job. I contacted with several professionals of the sector in order to get an idea of an overall cost of the game and I estimated that I could need about 15.000 dollars.
I will use the funds to Improve Game Graphics and Increase the Immersion of the player.
Each 3d asset cost around 80 dollars, right now the game has around 60 assets, that is a total amount of 4800 dollars . I didn't include future assets and the character so the cost would be more. Each concept art is around 400 dollars, I think 10 concept arts should be enough in order to get a global idea of the game, so that is 4000 dollars . The sounds/music I estimated over 2500 dollars. The licenses of the engine is about 1000 dollar. And the rest until the 15.000 dollars could be used to unexpected events.

Planned Platforms

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Well, it is not perfect yet, but we are working on it; that is why we need your support. It is our goal to create a perfect Internet experience for every Internet user, no matter who you are and no matter where you live.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Imagine, after starting your Internet browser, you find yourself on the perfect home page, personalized by you. Your news topics, your deals, your games, your bookmarks and messages from your friends and family - all on one page. No spyware, no spam, no boring ads. <a href=""http://www.perfectinter.net/vision.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CLICK HERE</a> to learn more about our vision.</p>
<p align=""justify"">MOST IMPORTANT: We are a company but we feel like a family. Our whole management team consists of members and all our projects, developments and improvements are based on the feedback and proposals of our 400,000+ members from more than 175 different countries.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Our community is growing fast and we are already listed as one of the world's Top 4000 websites by traffic, roughly generating the same number of page views as the good old myspace.com (source: alexa.com).</p>
<p><img alt=""Alexa.com chart 2013/08/10"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://video1.perfectinter.net/img/alexa.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Comparison myspace.com vs. perfectinter.net""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since we started our project back in 2006, we analyzed hundreds of successful websites and tried to find out three main things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are they successful?</li>
<li>Are there any disadvantages for the users?</li>
<li>How to make it better.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">As a result of this detailed research we've created a loooooooong (endless?) list of projects that should be done to create a better Internet for all.<br/></p>
<p align=""justify"">________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>
<h3>What Do We Need The Money For?</h3>
<p align=""justify"">We are proud that until today we kept our projects debt-free and that we did not have to partner with one of the big dogs who would tell us what to do and what not to do. With the help of our members we have invested more than 2.5 Million US$ since 2006 to make the Perfect Internet happen.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Like every other company we need money to develop our projects and to promote them. Some of our projects gain revenue (for example our advertising network and our deals pages) but most of our services are free benefits for our users (for example the personalizable home page, the safe web search, the spam-free email service).</p>
<p align=""justify"">
When it is your goal to improve communication, shopping, information and entertainment on the Internet, you automatically compete with the big dogs.</p>
<p>A better (safer) search engine?</p>
<p>A global social community that respects your privacy?</p>
<p>A faster news page?</p>
<p>A spam-free email service?</p>
<p>A global system for artists to monetize their music/videos?</p>
<p align=""justify"">The market leaders in these areas earn billions of $$$ and they have budgets far beyond our possibilities. But we know that it is not their Internet; the bottom line is that it is OURS, because we, the users, decide which websites and services we want to use.</p>
<p align=""justify"">
The more money we have available, the faster we can develop and improve our services. With a higher budget we are able to protect our assets by filing more patents and registering more global trademarks.</p>
<p>Here is how we will spend the money. We will...</p>
<ul>
<li>...hire more programmers</li>
<li>...buy/rent more server capacity</li>
<li>...develop more services</li>
<li>...improve existing services</li>
<li>...file patents</li>
<li>...register trademarks</li>
<li>...keep our services free for users from all countries</li>
<li>...expand our support team</li>
<li>...do whatever it takes to serve our members better</li>
</ul>
<p>________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>
<ul></ul>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What You Get For Your Money</h3>
<p align=""justify"">We believe in fairness and ""The Power of We"". Only together we are strong and as a family we have many strong arms to support those who need help. Did you know that many Internet companies do not offer their services in countries where the people earn less money?</p>
<p align=""justify"">Right from the start our project was open for all users, no matter where they are from. We are proud to be already one of the Top 200 websites in some of those countries, even if we don't make money there.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Beside the good feeling that you have helped us to reach our goals, we are happy to offer you a wide variety of perks, all of them related to one of our projects. Some of the perks are priceless, some of them give you more value than the amount of your contribution but all the perks have one thing in common - they are a big ""Thank You!"" for your support.</p>
<p align=""justify"">________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>
<h3 align=""justify"">Our Team</h3>
<p align=""justify"">Our global team consists of thousands of pro-active members who do what they can to let our vision of a perfect Internet come true. They translate our pages, they give support to other members, they have great ideas how to improve our services, they contact local businesses for our deals pages and they submit new projects for the perfect Internet.</p>
<p align=""justify"">We have an Advisory Board, elected by the members, and we have a team of 15 Directors, each of them in charge for a specific department.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.perfectinter.net/team.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Perfect Internet Team""><img alt=""The Team of Directors of Perfect Internet Inc."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://video1.perfectinter.net/img/team.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Team of Directors of Perfect Internet Inc.""/></a></p>
<p align=""justify"">
Our company is not structured like an average silicon valley venture. We do not spend money for representative office space, fancy cars and other gimmicks. We are registered in the U.S. but our team is spread all over the world. Literally, we are the first global project that is living the word ""global"" every single day.
</p>
<p align=""justify"">And even though we are structured, you cannot compare us with any other company on this planet. You can meet most of our directors in our community, our CEO is named ""Uncle Suresh"" by the members, our Marketing Director composed our theme song, you can watch our Secretary singing in our talent contest and our Director of Public Relations is doing a weekly show ""GEE on TV"".<br/><br/>As we mentioned earlier, we are more a family than a company. If you would like to be a part of our global family, we would be more than happy to welcome you at <a href=""http://www.perfectinter.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.perfectinter.net</a>. And if you would like to become pro-active and to help us to reach our goals, simply contact us.</p>
<p align=""justify"">________________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>
<h3>Our Projects</h3>
<p align=""justify"">When you browse our projects, please have in mind that none of them are ""perfect"" yet. Some of them are still under development and have not even started. The others are still in beta phase and they are improving daily, based on the feedback and the ideas of our members.</p>
<p align=""justify"">But there is one thing that all our projects have in common: maximum privacy!</p>
<p align=""justify"">We do not share any members' data with third party companies, we do not build customer profiles based on your activities on the Internet and we do not participate in any ""secret"" governmental programs to spy on users.</p>
<p align=""justify"">By the way, this is not a full list of the projects/services to be installed. We need to keep some of them a secret because some patent-pending or to be patented technology is involved. We don't want to give our competitors any hints and we try to avoid copycats. <br/></p>

Well, it is not perfect yet, but we are working on it; that is why we need your support. It is our goal to create a perfect Internet experience for every Internet user, no matter who you are and no matter where you live.
Imagine, after starting your Internet browser, you find yourself on the perfect home page, personalized by you. Your news topics, your deals, your games, your bookmarks and messages from your friends and family - all on one page. No spyware, no spam, no boring ads. CLICK HERE to learn more about our vision.
MOST IMPORTANT: We are a company but we feel like a family. Our whole management team consists of members and all our projects, developments and improvements are based on the feedback and proposals of our 400,000+ members from more than 175 different countries.
Our community is growing fast and we are already listed as one of the world's Top 4000 websites by traffic, roughly generating the same number of page views as the good old myspace.com (source: alexa.com).

Since we started our project back in 2006, we analyzed hundreds of successful websites and tried to find out three main things:

Why are they successful?
Are there any disadvantages for the users?
How to make it better.

As a result of this detailed research we've created a loooooooong (endless?) list of projects that should be done to create a better Internet for all.
________________________________________________________________________________
What Do We Need The Money For?
We are proud that until today we kept our projects debt-free and that we did not have to partner with one of the big dogs who would tell us what to do and what not to do. With the help of our members we have invested more than 2.5 Million US$ since 2006 to make the Perfect Internet happen.
Like every other company we need money to develop our projects and to promote them. Some of our projects gain revenue (for example our advertising network and our deals pages) but most of our services are free benefits for our users (for example the personalizable home page, the safe web search, the spam-free email service).

When it is your goal to improve communication, shopping, information and entertainment on the Internet, you automatically compete with the big dogs.
A better (safer) search engine?
A global social community that respects your privacy?
A faster news page?
A spam-free email service?
A global system for artists to monetize their music/videos?
The market leaders in these areas earn billions of $$$ and they have budgets far beyond our possibilities. But we know that it is not their Internet; the bottom line is that it is OURS, because we, the users, decide which websites and services we want to use.

The more money we have available, the faster we can develop and improve our services. With a higher budget we are able to protect our assets by filing more patents and registering more global trademarks.
Here is how we will spend the money. We will...

...hire more programmers
...buy/rent more server capacity
...develop more services
...improve existing services
...file patents
...register trademarks
...keep our services free for users from all countries
...expand our support team
...do whatever it takes to serve our members better

________________________________________________________________________________



What You Get For Your Money
We believe in fairness and ""The Power of We"". Only together we are strong and as a family we have many strong arms to support those who need help. Did you know that many Internet companies do not offer their services in countries where the people earn less money?
Right from the start our project was open for all users, no matter where they are from. We are proud to be already one of the Top 200 websites in some of those countries, even if we don't make money there.
Beside the good feeling that you have helped us to reach our goals, we are happy to offer you a wide variety of perks, all of them related to one of our projects. Some of the perks are priceless, some of them give you more value than the amount of your contribution but all the perks have one thing in common - they are a big ""Thank You!"" for your support.
________________________________________________________________________________
Our Team
Our global team consists of thousands of pro-active members who do what they can to let our vision of a perfect Internet come true. They translate our pages, they give support to other members, they have great ideas how to improve our services, they contact local businesses for our deals pages and they submit new projects for the perfect Internet.
We have an Advisory Board, elected by the members, and we have a team of 15 Directors, each of them in charge for a specific department.


Our company is not structured like an average silicon valley venture. We do not spend money for representative office space, fancy cars and other gimmicks. We are registered in the U.S. but our team is spread all over the world. Literally, we are the first global project that is living the word ""global"" every single day.

And even though we are structured, you cannot compare us with any other company on this planet. You can meet most of our directors in our community, our CEO is named ""Uncle Suresh"" by the members, our Marketing Director composed our theme song, you can watch our Secretary singing in our talent contest and our Director of Public Relations is doing a weekly show ""GEE on TV"".As we mentioned earlier, we are more a family than a company. If you would like to be a part of our global family, we would be more than happy to welcome you at www.perfectinter.net. And if you would like to become pro-active and to help us to reach our goals, simply contact us.
________________________________________________________________________________
Our Projects
When you browse our projects, please have in mind that none of them are ""perfect"" yet. Some of them are still under development and have not even started. The others are still in beta phase and they are improving daily, based on the feedback and the ideas of our members.
But there is one thing that all our projects have in common: maximum privacy!
We do not share any members' data with third party companies, we do not build customer profiles based on your activities on the Internet and we do not participate in any ""secret"" governmental programs to spy on users.
By the way, this is not a full list of the projects/services to be installed. We need to keep some of them a secret because some patent-pending or to be patented technology is involved. We don't want to give our competitors any hints and we try to avoid copycats.

<h2><b>Where Does Your Money Go?</b></h2>
<p>First, it costs a lot of money to run a charity from the day-to-day especially for program delivery:</p>
<p>-Support group rental facilities and utilities- keeping a roof over their head so they can host the groups.</p>
<p>-Insurance for their programs - they have to ensure they are protected and participants too.</p>
<p>-Refreshments for group participants so they can enjoy some coffee and food over the year at group  and feel welcome.</p>
<p>-Promo and print materials for programs are a big deal - pink catchy babe folders with thousands of colored photocopied material to showcase the presentations in packages for schools. Bipolar Babe purchases over 300 pink glossy folders with information to give to Principals, Vice-Principals, and every counselor in the city. They also print off over 2000 feedback forms for kids to relay their experience of watching a mental health presentation.</p>
<p>-New rack Cards with photos and graphic design are needed to explain their programs along with an additional rack card that we share in the classroom and at community events with kids that directs them to help at <a href=""www.bipolarbabe.com/help"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bipolarbabe.com/help</a> After these youth watch a presentation, many realize they need some help and direction, so Bipolar Babe offers guidance online for those after the presentation. They have also had the opportunity to direct students to help in person due to these informational cards.</p>
<p>Without these items Bipolar Babe would not be able to successfully promote and deliver their programs.</p>
<p><b>iBRiD</b> needs your funds to jump-start our business, we have to pay for stock, shipping, marketing, packaging, and you will be supporting our new innovative business. The profits are all going into the business and we would appreciate this much needed boost.</p>

TrapTap is a simple and stylish wireless button that warns you of speed traps, red light cameras, and school zones by flashing different colors. Best yet, it has a 2-year battery life!
It already knows the location of every red light camera and school zone but relies on its community of users to mark the location of mobile and radar traps. 




TrapTap is completely legal (not a radar detector) and acts like your personal co-pilot, constantly warning you of danger. To us, he is like our little buddy who always sits shotgun. It simply sits on your dash and is designed to save you cash.



  


  


The purchase of 1 TrapTap is far less than the cost of 1 speeding ticket. The average person spends $300 in tickets or more a year. That is a life savings of over $12,000!
Even if you don't get a lot of tickets, TrapTap could save you the possibility of getting that ""surprise"" ticket when you least expect it. 







  


With being dangerous and illegal to use mobile apps while driving, we found a better way to save you from those speeding tickets and add some safety in your life. 


  


 


   


  




TrapTap Has Been Pre-Mapped In The Following Countries:

  


   

How To Use
TrapTap adapts to fit your lifestyle. Have it blink when you come near a trap or only if you're speeding near one.

 To set a trap, double tap your TrapTap. 


 Same goes for clearing traps that are no longer there. Just tap it twice.


 Simply ""snooze"" your TrapTap alerts by clicking the top button once.


 Your TrapTap is connected to your phone and uses its GPS and the TrapTap app to send the device notifications. Connect the free app once and never have to touch it again.


  





Your TrapTap comes with a reusable sticky pad. You can stick it almost anywhere in your car. 

  


  

 
Easily move it from car to car.

 


  

 Available Colors
You will be able to customize your TrapTap and select accessories in an email survey that will be sent after you complete your purchase. 

  

 
Limited Edition Colors

  


  


Mounting Accessories
Your TrapTap comes with a reusable sticky pad, but these great accessories make it even easier to move and mount your TrapTap anywhere:





  


Well simply speaking, you and everyone who has a TrapTap is officially apart of the TrapTap Army. Congratulations Private! ""Salute""
We rely on you and the community to help warn drivers of those mobile speed and radar traps. We know the location of each red light camera and school zone, and rely on each other to help find the rest.

  

How do you compare?

<p><strong>Risk and Challenge</strong></p>
<p>We worked for more than three years to redevelop and optimize the newest generation of XOUNTS. We used the time since our first kickstarter campaign to check up the quality of our products again. We optimized the cooperation between us and our suppliers and also worked on the techniques of our products to ensure the quality. Now our partners and we are ready to go and all of the tools and procedures for production are all set.<br/>In order to finally get going we need your support: Our vision of the XOUNTS 2.0 can only be realized by producing a high number of pieces and doing a consequent and hard investment. Backers like you, who believe in our idea, are crucial for our success.<br/>By manufacturing a generation of XOUNTS before, we have lots of experience concerning production and fulfillment. But of course every production process might cause complications and disturb our timetable. To reduce this risk, we only cooperate with selected partners and consultants, and our engineers and product managers constantly keep in touch with them to be always up-to-date.<br/>On our journey to the new era of XOUNTS we definitely expect surprises in one way or another. But we guarantee: Our team is highly motivated and works professionally, thus we will easily solve every challenge. Finally, we all pursue one common target:<br/>We want to produce the best XOUNTS ever – and we want you to receive and enjoy it just in time.</p>

This previous model already won many fans and convinced in numerous tests. Furthermore we presented XOUNTS within events, cooperation and other activities. Thus we collected a lot of pictures and videos of XOUNTS in action. For the new generation we checked and improved every detail of your XOUNTS and are proud to announce an even better experience of sound and design. Our motto: Proven Concept – Crucial Improvements.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between the first and the second generation of XOUNTS? </strong></p><p>Proven Concept – Crucial Improvements   The first generation of XOUNTS was already a great product that received many test awards and enthusiastic feedback from happy customers. Now the brand-new second generation of XOUNTS has been improved in virtually every aspect to provide an even better music and design experience.  Acoustics Both the exciters and the material of the sound pyramid have been newly designed according to latest developments in technology and research. As a result the new XOUNTS covers a broader frequency range, is able to provide more volume with less distortion and creates an even more impressive 360-degree sound field. The base unit has also been completely reworked: now it is more sturdy and robust and houses a larger subwoofer (6.5“) as well as a new bass reflex design. Therefore the new generation of XOUNTS delivers deeper, louder and more controlled bass that integrates better with the sound emitted by the sound pyramid.   Mechanics Maybe the most important improvement of the newest generation of XOUNTS is the solid locking mechanism that secures the sound pyramid to the base unit. This not only adds a lot of stability to the XOUNTS to be carried and placed elsewhere easily, but it also helps to improve the sound quality by avoiding unwanted vibrations. Another novelty are the magnets to hold the pyramid’s tip in place.    Electronics The internal electronics have also been completely overhauled for the new generation of XOUNTS. Now it features Digital Signal Processing (DSP) that allows finer tuning of the system's sound. Also new are the AUX output and the USB input for direct playing of music files.   It might be very similar to the first generation of XOUNTS on first sight but XOUNTS 2.0 is a completely new product! It's performance has been vastly improved by a huge engineering effort which took more than two years. All materials and components have been upgraded and the entire structure is much more sturdier now. All this contributes to the dramatic improvement of sound performance. It is simply the best XOUNTS possible right now. Just have a listen and convince yourself!</p><p><strong>I don‘t see any loudspeaker on my XOUNTS – where does the music come from? </strong></p><p>Your XOUNTS emits the sound with its entire surface and pushes it in every direction for a unique sound experience.

Risk and Challenge
We worked for more than three years to redevelop and optimize the newest generation of XOUNTS. We used the time since our first kickstarter campaign to check up the quality of our products again. We optimized the cooperation between us and our suppliers and also worked on the techniques of our products to ensure the quality. Now our partners and we are ready to go and all of the tools and procedures for production are all set.In order to finally get going we need your support: Our vision of the XOUNTS 2.0 can only be realized by producing a high number of pieces and doing a consequent and hard investment. Backers like you, who believe in our idea, are crucial for our success.By manufacturing a generation of XOUNTS before, we have lots of experience concerning production and fulfillment. But of course every production process might cause complications and disturb our timetable. To reduce this risk, we only cooperate with selected partners and consultants, and our engineers and product managers constantly keep in touch with them to be always up-to-date.On our journey to the new era of XOUNTS we definitely expect surprises in one way or another. But we guarantee: Our team is highly motivated and works professionally, thus we will easily solve every challenge. Finally, we all pursue one common target:We want to produce the best XOUNTS ever – and we want you to receive and enjoy it just in time.

Proven Concept – Crucial Improvements   The first generation of XOUNTS was already a great product that received many test awards and enthusiastic feedback from happy customers. Now the brand-new second generation of XOUNTS has been improved in virtually every aspect to provide an even better music and design experience.  Acoustics Both the exciters and the material of the sound pyramid have been newly designed according to latest developments in technology and research.

The base unit has also been completely reworked: now it is more sturdy and robust and houses a larger subwoofer (6.5“) as well as a new bass reflex design. Therefore the new generation of XOUNTS delivers deeper, louder and more controlled bass that integrates better with the sound emitted by the sound pyramid.   Mechanics Maybe the most important improvement of the newest generation of XOUNTS is the solid locking mechanism that secures the sound pyramid to the base unit. This not only adds a lot of stability to the XOUNTS to be carried and placed elsewhere easily, but it also helps to improve the sound quality by avoiding unwanted vibrations.

<br/><p><b>Technical challenges</b>: </p>
<p>The CloudAntenna team have been working on the technology for 18 months and with our partner's and technology suppliers support, we have a working prototype of CloudAtenna and that have been testing it here in San Diego, with our development  team in Ukraine and India. The brains of CloudAntenna designed and developed by one of the largest chip makers. In addition, we have lined up a few alternatives for 4G LTE USB Modem. With their support and technical know how we are marching towards mass production.</p>
<p><b>Product updates</b>: </p>
<p>We want our entire community to know that the product details may change over the course of the manufacturing process. We want to ensure that we deliver the highest quality CloudAntenna possible. We will keep you updated on any and all changes.</p>
<p><b>Delivery</b>: </p>
<p>We have several contract manufacturers to choose from, and once one selected we will prepare a solid production plan. We have a strong team, however unexpected component delays and shortages can occur. If this happens, you will be the first to know and we will work hard to quickly solve the problem. </p>
<p>We are planning for delivery in June 2016 accounting for as many worst case scenarios as possible. However, it is impossible to account for every scenario due to practicality</p>

<p><strong>Why design the M1?</strong><br/> We believe the potential of the Mini-ITX form factor has been stunted by the lack of high performance cases currently available for the platform. We also share a dissatisfaction towards the overuse of plastic, mediocre aesthetics, bloated case dimensions and lack of watercooling support common to many Mini-ITX cases.

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I get an NCASE M1?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> By contributing to the <strong>production crowdfunding campaign</strong>, which will be launched <strong>after</strong> the current campaign has ended and the prototype has been tested. The current campaign is <strong>only</strong> to help us produce and test a prototype.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need to contribute now to be able to get a case during the production campaign?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No. Contributing $10 now will put you on the list to receive a case from the first shipment, but is not required to participate in the production campaign.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does being on the early shipment list guarantee I will receive a case?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No. It only puts you on the list for the first shipment. The first shipment will only happen if the production campaign is successfully funded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: When will the first shipment of the M1 be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The tentative timeframe for the first shipment is August. Once the current campaign has ended, there will be a testing period, followed by the second crowdfunding campaign, and then the production run (contingent on full funding of the second campaign). </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Why does it say ""delivery: April"" then for the early shipping list?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Because Indiegogo requires a delivery date for each perk. All it means is you'll be put on the <strong>early shipping list </strong>by April. The actual <strong>production M1 first shipment</strong> won't be until after succesful funding of the second campaign and manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: When will the production campaign launch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We expect to have it launched towards the end of April. If you've participated in the first campaign, you'll be notified when the production campaign launches.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: How much will I have to contribute during the production campaign to get an M1 case?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>$160-$200, plus shipping and fees to your country.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will I be able to get the final production M1 shipped to Europe/elsewhere? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Will the M1 be available to buy some other way than through participating in the production campaign?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We have no plans at this time to make the M1 available beyond the crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I preorder an M1?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No. The only way to get an M1 will be through participation in the second crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Design/Compatibility Questions</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>Q: Mini-ITX boards only have one expansion slot and video cards usually only use two, so why does the case have three slots?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> To accomodate the following:<br/>- GPUs with triple-slot coolers<br/>- Slot mounted accessories, e.g. fan controllers<br/>- Mini-DTX motherboards (which allows a second card in addition to a dual slot GPU)<br/>- Drives / fans / cables (not wasted space if third slot is left unused)</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Q: Since it has three slots already, why not just add one more and make it microATX?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> MicroATX boards are <em>not</em> just one more slot, they are also much longer than Mini-ITX (244mm vs. 170mm). The extra space required for an mATX board is occupied by the power supply; changing the design to accommodate the larger board would necessitate an unacceptable increase in size (and would result in a layout very much like the Silverstone SG09).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Will the Swiftech H220 fit? Will the Corsair H100 fit? Can two closed-loop liquid coolers be installed in the case?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> The answers to these questions is a tentative yes based on published specs and drawings, however it's impossible to be 100% certain without testing the actual physical parts. With any type of water cooling setup, the tubing will likely be the most challenging part.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Q: What thickness of radiator will fit?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> It's best to stay with slim radiators only (i.e., under 35mm thick), though thicker <em>may</em> fit.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Can a radiator be mounted on the bottom?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> It's possible, but it's DIY territory. It would require GPU watercooling, a slim radiator (30mm), and slim fans.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Will a pump and/or reservoir fit inside the case?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> Depending on the parts used, it's possible to mount certain pumps and/or reservoirs internally.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Can a modular ATX power supply be used?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> A longer GPU will hit the modular plugs, so that's the limiting factor.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Q: What is the case made from?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> Anodized 1.5mm aluminum.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Q: Who will be manufacturing the case?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> Lian Li.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Will it come with fan filters? Magnetic ones?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes. No.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Q: Will the logo be on the side, as shown in the pictures?</strong><br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> The current plan is to include an adhesive-backed vinyl decal (AKA, a sticker) with the design shown in the renders, which will be shipped with the case but not applied. You'll be able to apply it wherever you want (or not).<br/><br/><br/></p></div>","Who is NCASE? We're two Small Form Factor (SFF) PC enthusiasts from the [H]ardForum that connected while discussing our visions for the perfect SFF computer case.
Why design the M1? We believe the potential of the Mini-ITX form factor has been stunted by the lack of high performance cases currently available for the platform. We also share a dissatisfaction towards the overuse of plastic, mediocre aesthetics, bloated case dimensions and lack of watercooling support common to many Mini-ITX cases. So we did the logical thing...we designed the product we wanted to buy - the NCASE M1.
Why should you care? By backing this project you can prove to companies that more involvement and coordination with the PC building community can result in innovative products where previously there had been stagnation.

<p>We’re all dependent on our smartphones. But there are lots of times when it’s just not practical to pick up and operate your phone. You could be driving, running, at a show, in the shower, playing a sport... or, it’s simply out of reach.</p>
<p>The point is, there’s a 4 – 8% time gap when we’re cut-off and unconnected from our phones. For many people, these periods are downright unbearable. </p>
<p>Enter <strong>Polso</strong> —</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/105/495/04abd084cfd4d7a9e71adc43a2d3e656_large.png?1344461979"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><em>Un-phone yourself with Polso.</em><br/>(Note: image is a prototype and subject to variation)</p>
<h1>What’s it for?</h1>
<p>Supporting both iPhone and Android devices, Polso can perform most voice-enabled smartphone tasks <em>right from your wrist,</em> up to 30 feet away from your phone. Use Polso to answer calls, send text messages, search the web – nearly any voice command, even if your phone was asleep. If you have an iPhone you can fully operate Siri with Polso, and popular voice command applications are supported for Android users.</p>
<p>Since the water-resistant Polso enables smartphone use even when your phone is not physically accessible, we’re sure you’ll come up with even more creative uses!</p>
<h1>Who might use Polso?</h1>
<p>Polso (Ital: <em>wrist</em>) is for anyone who owns a smartphone. It is not a geeky tech gadget (although we do love those), it’s a<em><strong> simple to use bluetooth bracelet</strong></em> that connects you to your phone at all times. With just one multifunction button plus volume control, Polso simply sends and relays voice commands to and from your smartphone while it's out of reach. It's extremely simple to use and will make interacting with your voice enabled phone at anytime a breeze. Want to send or read a text? Polso can do that! Want to make a list or send yourself a note? Polso can do that too!</p>
<h1>Where are we at?</h1>
<p>The prototype in our video is a real, fully-functional Polso. She hasn't been prettied-up yet, but that's in the works. It does connect seamlessly to both iPhone and Android phones, sends and receives information, and does exactly what we want it to do.</p>

<p>We are also working on enhancing the software that runs on Polso to make it more intuitive to use.</p>

<p>We have partnered a manufacturing and development shop and have the experience and relationships in place to bring Polso to life. Now, we just need your support to make Polso a real product!</p>
<h1>Why Indiegogo?</h1>
<p>Raising our Indiegogo goal will enable us to focus on developing a strong, marketable product. We'll use the investment to improve the prototype and set up full scale production so that Polso can be sold to everyone. We will also use the funds to begin marketing Polso both online and offline. Our goal is to keep the retail price of Polso low, so this funding round enables a larger initial manufacturing batch which will significantly decrease our production cost, savings which we will pass on to our customers.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you</strong> for taking the time to learn about Polso. We hope you’ll support Polso at any level. </p></div>","Polso: Send and receive voice commands from your smartphone.
We’re all dependent on our smartphones. But there are lots of times when it’s just not practical to pick up and operate your phone. You could be driving, running, at a show, in the shower, playing a sport... or, it’s simply out of reach.
The point is, there’s a 4 – 8% time gap when we’re cut-off and unconnected from our phones. For many people, these periods are downright unbearable. 
Enter Polso —

Un-phone yourself with Polso.(Note: image is a prototype and subject to variation)
What’s it for?
Supporting both iPhone and Android devices, Polso can perform most voice-enabled smartphone tasks right from your wrist, up to 30 feet away from your phone. Use Polso to answer calls, send text messages, search the web – nearly any voice command, even if your phone was asleep. If you have an iPhone you can fully operate Siri with Polso, and popular voice command applications are supported for Android users.
Since the water-resistant Polso enables smartphone use even when your phone is not physically accessible, we’re sure you’ll come up with even more creative uses!
Who might use Polso?
Polso (Ital: wrist) is for anyone who owns a smartphone. It is not a geeky tech gadget (although we do love those), it’s a simple to use bluetooth bracelet that connects you to your phone at all times. With just one multifunction button plus volume control, Polso simply sends and relays voice commands to and from your smartphone while it's out of reach. It's extremely simple to use and will make interacting with your voice enabled phone at anytime a breeze. Want to send or read a text? Polso can do that! Want to make a list or send yourself a note? Polso can do that too!
Where are we at?
The prototype in our video is a real, fully-functional Polso. She hasn't been prettied-up yet, but that's in the works. It does connect seamlessly to both iPhone and Android phones, sends and receives information, and does exactly what we want it to do.
What’s next?
We are in the process of upgrading the circuit board so it’s smaller and thinner than the one in our prototype:

We are also working on enhancing the software that runs on Polso to make it more intuitive to use.
Finally, we are planning to develop an open source voice application for Android and iOS that enables third party programmers to intercept voice commands from Polso and use them to drive their own software.
We have partnered a manufacturing and development shop and have the experience and relationships in place to bring Polso to life. Now, we just need your support to make Polso a real product!

Built with military grade foil and braid double shielded woven cable, military grade MIL-E-5272 PET Expandable Braided Sleeving, aerospace grade AMS-DTL-23053 heat shrink and Apple MFi certification, it's a cable that’s built to last and what Apple should have made in the first place! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1181273/files/20150129011310-02-main04.jpg?1422522790"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We have been designing and custom building high end audio cable, smartphone cable and charger for over five years. We custom built our first iPhone cable in 2013 and during this process we discovered that the Apple Lightning cable is poorly designed and constructed; the cable is vulnerable to breakage, fraying, and according to a ZDNet's report, corrosion as well.  With the Statement WKW cable, we have created a cable that's incredibly strong, durable, elegant and functional. It will be the last Lightning iDevice cable you'll ever buy.</span><p></p><br/><h2><b>Flexible &amp; Tangle Free Design</b></h2><b></b><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1164403/files/20150121063727-000001-1.jpg?1421851047"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><ul>

<h2>Idea:</h2>
<p>Our inspiration for the Statement WKW came from ideas and design that are not common for your average iDevice cables and accessories.  Our research covered other luxury products such as jewelry, high-end headphones, watches, audiophile speaker cable and interconnects.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/629555/files/20140605214042-000000.jpg?1402029642"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<span></span><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is important to us that our cable not only look stunning, but also of high quality and craftsmanship that you will recognize once you put them in your own hands. We have decided on a combination of audiophile cable design concepts, high-end audio fiber sleeve and double shielded woven cable to achieve a clean signal path and durability.</p>

<p><b>(2) </b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Is Statement WKW unbreakable?</b></span></p>
<p>No, nothing is unbreakable! Statement WKW were designed to be robust, because both 8pin and USB is hot-pluggable, the connectors would be used more frequently, and perhaps with less care, than other connectors. However they are not unbreakable, both connector is design to break off if the pressure is strong enough to prevent equipment ( iPhone, iPod or PC) damage. This design was made so that both connectors on the less expensive cable would bear the most wear instead of the more expensive iPhone, iPod or PC.</p>
<p><b>(3) How do I choose the color of the cable? </b>  We will sent a survey via email, and you can choose you color of the cable.<br/></p>

_______________________________________________________________________
What is Statement WKW?Statement WKW is a beautifully designed cable for your iPhone, iPod & iPad. Built with military grade foil and braid double shielded woven cable, military grade MIL-E-5272 PET Expandable Braided Sleeving, aerospace grade AMS-DTL-23053 heat shrink and Apple MFi certification, it's a cable that’s built to last and what Apple should have made in the first place! We have been designing and custom building high end audio cable, smartphone cable and charger for over five years. We custom built our first iPhone cable in 2013 and during this process we discovered that the Apple Lightning cable is poorly designed and constructed; the cable is vulnerable to breakage, fraying, and according to a ZDNet's report, corrosion as well.  With the Statement WKW cable, we have created a cable that's incredibly strong, durable, elegant and functional. It will be the last Lightning iDevice cable you'll ever buy.Flexible & Tangle Free Design
Much stronger, yet more flexible than standard iPhone cables.
Exceptional craftsmanship.
4 ft length ensures that you have enough to reach from wall plug to desktop.
The connectors get an additional aerospace grade heat shrink that permanently straightens both the cable and the connector to providing cable-stress relieve.

Statement WKW 2.0 -  Purple.  

Statement WKW 2.0 - Reflex®Silver.

Idea:
Our inspiration for the Statement WKW came from ideas and design that are not common for your average iDevice cables and accessories.  Our research covered other luxury products such as jewelry, high-end headphones, watches, audiophile speaker cable and interconnects.



It is important to us that our cable not only look stunning, but also of high quality and craftsmanship that you will recognize once you put them in your own hands. We have decided on a combination of audiophile cable design concepts, high-end audio fiber sleeve and double shielded woven cable to achieve a clean signal path and durability.










Built to Last.
Inside the audiophile style fiber sleeve is a 
fully rated foil and braid double shielded  woven cable. It is much stronger, yet more flexible 
than standard Apple cables.
The Statement WKW 2.0 has the 8 pin connector, circuit board, and woven cable fully enclosed for an incredibly strong and durable termination. The internal wiring are rated for 4+ Amps!  Whether you are using a standard 12V car charger or a high-power 20 Watt 2.1A (2000mA) wall USB charger, the Statement WKW allows for the quickest charging times possible.



Apple MFi Certified Components

Having designed and built smartphone cables for over 4 years, we understand the significance of how original certified parts ensure quality and safety.  While this increases the production time and direct materials cost, using original Apple MFi components make certain that our cable continues to work with future iOS updates while protecting your precious idevices from incorrect and possibly dangerous voltage and current that non-certified accessories provides.


Lightning compatibility: Compatible with every Apple iPhone, iPad & iPod with a Lightning 
connector. This includes the iPhone 6 Plus / 6 / 5S / 5C / 5, iPad Air, iPad with Retina display, iPad Mini, iPad mini with Retina display, 
iPod Touch 5th generation, iPod Nano 7th generation and all new iOS devices.

""Made for iPod"" , ""Made for iPhone""  and ""Made for iPad"" mean that an electronic accessory has been designed to connect specifically to iPod, or iPhone, respectively, and has been certified by the developer to meet Apple performance standards.

Our StoryFounded in 2008, WKW Custom Cable is one of the premiere smartphone accessories and custom high-end audio cable company in the San Francisco Sunset District.  We were always fond of old world craftsmanship and has been in a continual state of refinement, seeking not only to make our cable better and better with each generation, but also to create entirely new products that serve the needs of our customers.


(1) We designed our first iPhone cable ( iTrim ) for an oversea client and introduced audiophile concept to the world of charge-and-sync cables.



(2) We also helped another Client in Singapore to design and manufacture a stylish iPhone cable ( Designer ) for their Groupon and Livingsocial campaign.



(3) In 2013, we finally designed and built our very own custom iPhone cable (Statement), 300+ working prototypes was built and sold within 2 months.












Where we are:


 Design – We have already completed our design and the first 300 working prototypes.
Manufacturer –We have established a great working relationship with our Apple licensed manufacturer in Taiwan with pricing and order quantities confirmed.
Certification - The cable is already tested and approved according to the Apple MFi program.

Production - As of December 2014, production are completed and ready to ship.

Production - As of March 2015, design and production of Statement WKW 2.0 are completed and ready to ship.


 Design and Testing – As of September 2015, we are in the final adjusting and testing stage of ""Statement Military "" aka ""Statement 3.0"" working prototypes. The cable will be ready for MIL-STD-810 testing at the beginning of 2016.



Why we need you:
(1) Because we use the highest quality materials available, our direct materials cost is very high. Since we will never sacrifice quality for profits while fully aware that we must be sustainable and be able to grow. In order to lower the unit cost, we will need to buy components in bulk and mass-produce the double shielded cable, male USB & 8 pin connector by an Apple licensed manufacturer. (2) The cost of Apple MFi Certification.(3) The cost of the military grade expandable braided sleeving and cable.(4) New cable development - Additional funds needed for development of Statement.Military ( formerly known as WKW 3.0 ), Statement.Military will be design according to MIL-STD-810 standard for military applications and Apple MFi standard. The prototype will be ready for testing on or after July 2016.








Risks and Challenges:
MFi Certification - 
Like other MFi accessory makers, we are dependent on Apple with the production quantities of the actual MFi Lightning 8 pin connector.
 Our timeline is therefore partially dictated by Apple. We will do our 
best to push for a timely production.

<p>Sure, you can easily get your own single-board computer mailed directly to your home, but what the hell are you supposed to do with it? As a matter of fact, if you need a new PC for your home, you are basically forced to select between the same variety of products available for the last few decades: desktop or laptop, with a price range of $400-$2000 from the same variety of companies.</p>
<br/><p>Desktops and laptops ruled the home computer market for decades. The introduction of smartphones and tablets had only a minor impact on the home computation solutions available today. Although you own between 5-10 'screens' (desktop, laptop, mobile or tablet) per family at home, your home devices are isolated from each other. The easiest way to share a picture with your family is, absurdly, to send it by email, a message, or by connecting proprietary cables. </p>

<br/>FAQ</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
</div>
<p>Q: <b>Why did you name the product imp?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are huge fans of the TV series ‘Game of Thrones’, and are especially fond of Tyrion Lannister, whose nickname is, well, the imp. </span><span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""e8176a5d-67bc-4a9a-bf65-a27514184a68"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Imp</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> is also a small and powerful daemon just like our tiny computer.</span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>Can I use/install Windows on imp?</b><br/><span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""c3fb0ee8-b829-45d0-9c16-c99a96a9feee"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">imp</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> uses Open Source software and is based on Ubuntu, Linux. So, no, you cannot install Windows. If you insist, you can use Microsoft Office Online.</span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>Is imp using a new OS?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">No. We are using Ubuntu, Linux. It is the most popular Linux distribution, with tens of Millions installations worldwide. </span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>What does it mean that <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""7b3fa188-e338-4b43-873a-36b9151256ba"">imp</span> is Open Source?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">When you turn to open source software, you free yourself from the vendor lock-in. Customers of such non open source vendors are kept at the mercy of those vendors' vision, requirements, dictates, prices, priorities and timetables. As a result, these customers are paying for products with limited capabilities &amp; performance.</span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>Why is the fact that <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""20381512-9c57-4650-b248-d22481dbc091"">imp</span> is Open Source so important?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Being open source means that all of the software components of imp are free and open for anyone to change and contribute to.<br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And similarly, by switching to open source, you are in control. You have the power to make your own decisions, and to do as you wish with the software. You also have a worldwide community of software developers and other users like you at your disposal to assist with whatever you want to modify.</span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>Is your hardware Open Source?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are 100% committed to Open Source, and all of our software components are open and public for anyone to see and contribute. Nevertheless, we do offer proprietary services, which are closed, that you can opt out of. In addition, our hardware is composed of an open source single-board platform, the Odroid U3. Please note that Odroid’s user-land GPU drivers are library binary format, which are non-open.</span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>Why did you choose Odroid U3 as your hardware platform?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We ourselves use single boards on a daily basis, and have tested a lot of them, while considering multiple factors, in order to ensure a great user experience. The Odroid U3 enables HD streaming to your TV, while using imp’s desktop at the same time, which is impressive to say the least.</span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>Do you support multiple languages?</b><br/><span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""7bb5df2f-1f0c-42f3-a499-f8805043e4fa"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">imp’s OS</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> is based on Ubuntu, which has more than 28 fully translated languages and a total of 218 supported languages.</span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>How do I pledge for more than one imp?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Simply pledge for one, and shoot us an email to contact@imp.computer notifying us of your pledge amount and desired quantity.</span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>When will I get my imp?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If you gave a contribution and snatched an early bird, your imp will be shipped to you by next March. </span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>Are you going to ship imp in different <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""98d04983-b5e5-4a29-99e3-3861a130b25f"">colors</span>?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">At the moment, “you can have any </span><span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""25ac0c9e-1f47-4903-a6b5-bd97b97b1899"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">color</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, as long it is black”.

<p><br/>Q: <b>Do you ship worldwide?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Yep. We offer flat rate shipping, with the thought of minimizing shipping costs. </span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>How much memory does imp have?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">8GB SD storage (our premium edition comes with 16GB), and 2GB of RAM. If you’re the meticulous type, we kindly ask you to consult HardKernel's website for more technical information. </span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>What if 8GB simply doesn’t cut it for me? </b><br/><span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""6c9af159-bf15-44ee-956a-626cfe329b6c"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">imp</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> integrates </span><span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""e112ad04-917d-4014-a420-0707d03775af"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ownCloud</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> to allow you as much storage as you need - just connect your imp to any HDD or add your preferred cloud storage using our walk-in-the-park easy-to-use wizard. In addition, you can upgrade your SD card, as long as it is a micro SD card, which doesn’t fall below speed class 10 standards.</span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>Is 2GB RAM enough? Is it expandable? </b><br/><span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""759178c1-3ee6-4b8d-80d8-0c5c1892cab4"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">imp</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> is optimized for average daily use, which doesn’t require more than 2GB of RAM. <br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Unfortunately, the RAM comes as POP (Package on Package) on top of the </span><span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""ca1e7cf0-5056-48f1-ba89-f0b548bb28c8"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">SoC</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, so it’s not removable and therefore not expandable. </span></p>
<p><br/>Q: <b>Can I upgrade imp's spec other than the RAM?</b><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Yes! </span><span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""a2792104-d4e0-4fd1-a39a-1ece68ae553e"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">you</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> are more than welcome to do so.

Social responsibility is at the top of our core values. As an affordable computer, imp is offering a $249 discounted perk; for every imp you buy, you donate an imp to Dandora HipHop City - a community art center in one of the ghettos of Nairobi, Kenya. This important program, led by the Kenyan musician Juliani, takes in young individuals who hold a keen interest in arts and entertainment, with the purpose to polish these talents’ musical abilities, and a goal to subsequently help them earn a living. The donated imps will be used for “school after school sessions” at Dandora HipHop City.























In recent years, away from consumer’s eyes, the computer market has been experiencing an earth-rattling revolution: single-board computers have become a prevalent force in the development world. Tens of different of these low cost, tiny computers are used by geeks and tech enthusiasts on a vast variety of amazing projects and purposes.




Sure, you can easily get your own single-board computer mailed directly to your home, but what the hell are you supposed to do with it? As a matter of fact, if you need a new PC for your home, you are basically forced to select between the same variety of products available for the last few decades: desktop or laptop, with a price range of $400-$2000 from the same variety of companies.
Desktops and laptops ruled the home computer market for decades. The introduction of smartphones and tablets had only a minor impact on the home computation solutions available today. Although you own between 5-10 'screens' (desktop, laptop, mobile or tablet) per family at home, your home devices are isolated from each other. The easiest way to share a picture with your family is, absurdly, to send it by email, a message, or by connecting proprietary cables. 
Meet imp. imp is a disruptive home computation solution: a handy, easy to use computer, based on open source technology, and cloud software services, running on a powerful single-board CPU: 1.7GHz, quad-core, ARM V9.

Risks & Challenges

We're an experienced team with more than 50 years combined, in delivering digital and consumer products. We have vast experience in technology execution, and background from leading companies: Emblaze, Telmap, Checkpoint, HP, Palm, and Motorola. Nevertheless, we do take into account that unexpected challenges are always around the corner.
We hereby promise to do everything in our power, so that our backers are well looked after, and that rewards are delivered on-time, or even earlier if time permits.
We've given the project a conservative estimate of milestones & delivery dates, and are committed to keeping you informed of our progress on a weekly basis, in the months following the campaign.
Our promise to deliver will be challenged by the known complexities of manufacturing, production scheduling, and fulfillment.

FAQ




Q: Why did you name the product imp?We are huge fans of the TV series ‘Game of Thrones’, and are especially fond of Tyrion Lannister, whose nickname is, well, the imp. Imp is also a small and powerful daemon just like our tiny computer.
Q: Can I use/install Windows on imp?imp uses Open Source software and is based on Ubuntu, Linux. So, no, you cannot install Windows. If you insist, you can use Microsoft Office Online.
Q: Is imp using a new OS?No. We are using Ubuntu, Linux. It is the most popular Linux distribution, with tens of Millions installations worldwide. 
Q: What does it mean that imp is Open Source?When you turn to open source software, you free yourself from the vendor lock-in. Customers of such non open source vendors are kept at the mercy of those vendors' vision, requirements, dictates, prices, priorities and timetables. As a result, these customers are paying for products with limited capabilities & performance.
Q: Why is the fact that imp is Open Source so important?Being open source means that all of the software components of imp are free and open for anyone to change and contribute to.And similarly, by switching to open source, you are in control. You have the power to make your own decisions, and to do as you wish with the software. You also have a worldwide community of software developers and other users like you at your disposal to assist with whatever you want to modify.
Q: Is your hardware Open Source?We are 100% committed to Open Source, and all of our software components are open and public for anyone to see and contribute. Nevertheless, we do offer proprietary services, which are closed, that you can opt out of. In addition, our hardware is composed of an open source single-board platform, the Odroid U3. Please note that Odroid’s user-land GPU drivers are library binary format, which are non-open.
Q: Why did you choose Odroid U3 as your hardware platform?We ourselves use single boards on a daily basis, and have tested a lot of them, while considering multiple factors, in order to ensure a great user experience. The Odroid U3 enables HD streaming to your TV, while using imp’s desktop at the same time, which is impressive to say the least.
Q: Do you support multiple languages?imp’s OS is based on Ubuntu, which has more than 28 fully translated languages and a total of 218 supported languages.
Q: How do I pledge for more than one imp?Simply pledge for one, and shoot us an email to contact@imp.computer notifying us of your pledge amount and desired quantity.
Q: When will I get my imp?If you gave a contribution and snatched an early bird, your imp will be shipped to you by next March. 
Q: Are you going to ship imp in different colors?At the moment, “you can have any color, as long it is black”. But, hey, we would love to get your take on the matter. 
Q: Do you ship worldwide?Yep. We offer flat rate shipping, with the thought of minimizing shipping costs. 
Q: How much memory does imp have?8GB SD storage (our premium edition comes with 16GB), and 2GB of RAM. If you’re the meticulous type, we kindly ask you to consult HardKernel's website for more technical information. 
Q: What if 8GB simply doesn’t cut it for me? imp integrates ownCloud to allow you as much storage as you need - just connect your imp to any HDD or add your preferred cloud storage using our walk-in-the-park easy-to-use wizard. In addition, you can upgrade your SD card, as long as it is a micro SD card, which doesn’t fall below speed class 10 standards.
Q: Is 2GB RAM enough? Is it expandable? imp is optimized for average daily use, which doesn’t require more than 2GB of RAM. Unfortunately, the RAM comes as POP (Package on Package) on top of the SoC, so it’s not removable and therefore not expandable. 
Q: Can I upgrade imp's spec other than the RAM?Yes! you are more than welcome to do so. Since imp’s hardware is based on Odroid-U3, you can upgrade your SD card and get more local storage, or upgrade/tweak any other component as you see fit.
Q: What are imp’s full hardware specs?imp’s more detailed hardware specifications, which are a bit overwhelming for the average Joe (consider yourself warned, Joe!), are available here:

</div></div>","My new product's been needed world wide a long time, for several good reasons like these below.

Now you can open the lid with both hands full.
Help reduce the spreading of germs.
Reduce a little hassle in your life.
Help children reach the lid.
Help the handicapped.
Help the elderly

 I am running this campaign to raise awareness and funds for my new Invention.The funds are needed to purchase materials in quantity to start the manufacturing of Mack's Lid Lifters. Here are some things I've done already to bring this new product to life.

I first decided to do the manufacturing myself here in the USA.
I have purchased the shop, tools and have a patent pending. 
I have designed, prototyped, perfected and powder coated them.
I have purchased shipping boxes and design labels.
I have invested $16,000 dollars and thousands of hours.
I have went door to door with great results for public feed back.
I have had lifters in use now for over a year with happy owners.
I have built a website for a future sales platform.

I have performed many hours of research into future sales options, and have some great opportunities just waiting formy product.


 Their are approx 80 million detached homes in the USA alone, not to mention.

medical facilities
apartments
businesses 
duplexes
condos
And the rest of the world.

                                         HERE'S THE PROOF
Just go to the can with both hands full, and see if you don't agree.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>WORLD'S FIRST iPHONE CASE THAT DOUBLES AS REFILLABLE BUTANE  LIGHTER!<p>Our Story:</p>
<p>Over a year ago, co-founder Raúl Góngora was sitting at a patio bar when he was asked by someone to borrow a lighter. When he checked his pockets, the only thing he could find was his iPhone. The idea immediately popped in his head to invent a case for an iPhone that would incorporate a butane lighter as part of the case. After weeks of searching the internet for a similar product and finding NOTHING like it, he began to draw up plans for his invention. Co-founder Rob Haas and roommate at the time, loved the idea and together they decided to make the dream a reality. They applied and received a patent and the last step was to produce it.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Raúl and Rob are both iPhone accessory fanatics. Always interested in anything iPhone related, they were a perfect match to create the next big iPhone accessory. <br/></p>
<p>The idea of the CELLTORCH was a perfect example of how necessity is the mother of invention. Being a smoker and like many other smokers, Raul would always lose his lighter by misplacing it or lending it to someone who would immediately put it in their pocket and not return it. Being that it was much harder to lose an iPhone, a smartphone case that WAS the lighter was the perfect combination.</p>
<p>They spent over a year designing and testing the case with engineers in order to have the perfect form and function. Big enough to hold a sufficient amount of butane so you wouldn't have to constantly refill it but small enough to hold comfortably in your hand and pocket. </p>

Lightercase is so simple. Watch a caveman use it:",5.0,1,"2 Campaigns

We have excellent product development engineers, and we have a mature production and manufacturing supply chain to ensure that our products are of high quality from design to output. Our first generation Super Cable have received a great response since they were put into the market. Now we are developing a new generation products, which we believe will bring surprises to our users.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As a hardware project, there are natural risks and challenges in engineering and manufacturing. Due to supply chain issues and other reasons, the final manufacturing schedule may be delayed.</p>
<p>However, we will be as transparent as possible to keep you informed and work to resolve any issues that may arise. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us.</p>

Delivers a high-speed charge while connected to a USB-C PD charger. 
Take advantage of the Fast Charge feature on your iPhone X—charging up to 50% in 30 minutes when connected to an 18W or higher USB-C power adapter.

iPhone XS Max Charging test. Charging up to 50% in 30 minutes when paired with an 18W or higher USB-C power adapter.

 Apple MFi Certified

MFi certified for compatibility and quality you can count on. 
We are an Apple MFi certified brand.
New lightning cable uses the C94 chip, which is the same bitcoin encryption level and cannot be cracked. Only the MFi-certified USB-C to Lightning charging cable support PD fast charging.
That means the fake ones will quit the market soon.
What is Apple MFi certified? 
 MFi Certified is short for ‘made for iPhone/iPad/iPod’ Certified, which is the official certification from Apple. Accessories that owns MFi certification will not damage your Apple devices or cause any danger such as electric leakage. 
Those cables designed with fresh ideas below are not able to obtain MFi Certification and can't work well with iPhones. Super Cable has MFi certification and is trustworthy.
Ultra-Strength

 
We use special technical processes and materials to make the super cable stronger and more conductive. 
 
 

You can pull a car with Super Cable to prove that this cable is strong enough.
 
Anti-Bending Design

This design can better protect your cable.
It took us a few months to complete a design that was very stylish and practical. We are proud of our design.

The cable works reliably after 30,000 multi-directional flexes. Lasts 30× longer than other cables.
 
Added Length 

 
Our 4-foot cable is longer than the standard 3-foot cable, so you can connect and charge your iPhone in the car, on the nightstand, and more.

Much thicker than Apple original USB-C to Lightning cable
 
Feedback

 
Feedback from the previous project: USB-C Super Cable. We will follow the same product standards and technical processes to make it ""SUPER"".

 
About us
Our product vision: simple, durable, worry-free. We seek the strongest and best materials to develop products with ergonomic designs.

<h2>Why do I need ID Guardian?</h2>
<p>Roughly 200 million credit and identification cards now have RFID technology embedded into them. All U.S. Passports issued since October 2006 also have RFID chips, which contain all the data from the document’s first page including your photo. A growing number of states (New York, Michigan, Washington, Vermont) are now issuing special driver’s licenses “enhanced” with long range RFID chips.</p>
<p>This technology leaves consumers vulnerable to electronic pickpocketing, which can happen in the blink of an eye without the victim even knowing.</p>
<p>ID Guardian protects your identification and financial information with stylish and convenient phone cases equipped with state-of-the-art technology that blocks unauthorized RFID readers.</p>

<h2>What is RFID and how does it work?</h2>
<p>RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is the technology that lets you simply wave your credit or identification card, passport or license in front of a nearby scanner instead of having to slide the magnetic stripe through it. It’s a fairly simple concept. The electronic scanner sends a signal that is received by an antenna connected to the card’s RFID chip, thus activating it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, criminals with minimal technical skills can construct their own clandestine RFID readers with a few simple supplies. These devices can steal your private financial information quickly and silently. All the perpetrator needs to do is come near your wallet with the hidden card reader.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><b></b></h2>
<h3>Does my card have an RFID chip?</h3>
<p>If your card is equipped with PayWave, PayPass or blink, as indicated by a logo on the card, then it has an RFID chip embedded in it. The absence of a logo, however, does not mean that your card does not have an RFID chip. To confirm, call the customer service number on the back of your card. Even if you cannot get a definite answer, it is always safest to protect your cards and ensure that you do not fall victim to identity theft.</p>

<h3>How Can I Guard Against Identity Theft and Electronic Pickpocketing?</h3>
<p>To prevent identity theft, you must vigilantly guard your personal information. Thoroughly shred all bank statements before recycling them, and cut up your old credit cards before discarding. Exercise caution when shopping at online retailers, and make sure that you do not submit your credit card information over any unsecured servers.</p>
<p>Most importantly, make sure you guard your credit and identification cards against unauthorized RFID readers from ID Guardian. Many credit cards contain RFID chips that record your personal information, so if you do not use a secure wallet, identity thieves can obtain your personal and financial data using hidden RFID readers.</p>

<p>We’ve been working on

developed a running app for Android, and your support will take helloZIG to the
next level to include the following:</p>
<p>1) A comprehensive

<p>Right now, helloZIG has Metro Manila covered,
but we want to help more travelers reach more local support from the rest of
Southeast Asia. Resources will go to making sure that all the
numbers in helloZIG are reliable and verified, so you can feel at ease.</p>
<p>2) Online and

<p>Your funding will
also go to the technical development, design, testing, and offline

highest level.<br/><br/></p>

<h3><b>Risks and Challenges</b></h3>
<p>1) helloZIG App: We work with the best development and design
team, but there is always the challenge of delays in product development from
the programming and coding side to the database verification process. We will
communicate with our backers throughout the process to keep everyone informed
and up to date with our progress in launching the app in different OS formats.</p>
<p>2) Rewards Fulfillment: There is
not much risk because we are working with tried and tested Filipino partners
who are highly professional and committed to delivering the best product. A
little risk maybe on the shipment side as this is something beyond our control
but our backers should trust that we are partnering with the best Filipino
delivery/shipment companies.</p>

for travel surprises with just one FREE download.No matter how
much you plan for your trip, problems happen, like a lost passport, broken
laptop, diarrhea, and so on, and you’d want to have someone to turn to
especially when you’re in unfamiliar territory, and with no internet access.
We at POPManila want to help. We’re a startup
from the Philippines, and we want you to visit our country as well as other
Southeast Asian nations. We recognize that not all countries have a reliable emergency number
like 9-1-1 in the U.S. We want your trip to be as hassle-free as possible, so we
built an app that has all the important local numbers a traveler might need and
can be accessed even while offline.
helloZIG has the following features to help promote safe and hassle-free trips:
OFFLINE ACCESS: It's hard to get consistent internet access when you're traveling.
How will you search for important numbers when data roaming or WIFI is not
accessible? helloZIG can be accessed even without internet connection so that
you know who to call at the moment of need. You can download and update
helloZIG before getting to your destination for your peace of mind.
TRAVEL-CENTRIC LISTING: helloZIG has all the local numbers you need while traveling such as Local Police, Ambulance, Embassies, Consulates, Banks, Hotels, Repair Shops, Food Delivery, Hospitals, 24-hour Drug Stores and even On-call Services. 
VERIFIED & CURATED NUMBERS: Our team carefully verifies the information
listed on helloZIG to make sure they are reliable.


ALL OS: helloZIG
will be developed for all OS (iOS, Android, Windows and Blackberry) so
more people can use it.


FREE CHAT: With this feature, you can contact businesses in other countries without worrying about long-distance SMS costs.
This feature will be developed on the latter part of 2015.

<p><b><span style=""color: #8bc34a;"">bleep </span></b>was founded by Maayan Goren, a student of Electrical
Engineering in Tel-Aviv University, Israel.</p>
<p>Our team consists of a
few hard workers, mainly family members, including a product designer, graphic designer,
industrial and electrical engineers, all working together around the clock to
make this product available in your local neighborhood cellular store, or even better,
as a part of your new smartphone kit. </p>
<p>We currently work in a

<p><b>How I came up with </b><b><span style=""color: #8bc34a;"">bleep</span></b><b>: </b></p>
<p>For most of us,
backing up our smartphone is a mystery. I realized smartphone users are divided
into two groups of people: Those who know how to backup their phones, and those
who know someone else that does. </p>
<p>Today, with our
crucial information stored in our smartphone, backup became a MUST-HAVE. My
view is that the solution to backing up our phone data has to be on a simple,
routine basis. We have to combine phone backup with something we normally do
with our phones. So I thought of our daily charging routine. </p>
<p>The design and
functionality of our standard chargers haven't changed for years. While phones
became smartphones, chargers remained “just” chargers. I've decided to change

Everywhere. Our aim is to put a smile on your face and a <b><span style=""color: #8bc34a;"">bleep</span></b> in your bag.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today most of the

<p>* First backup should take longer in order to backup all your files.</p>
<p>Q: <b>What are the </b><b><span style=""color: #8bc34a;"">bleep</span></b><b> benefits over cloud backup?</b></p>
<p>A: <b><span style=""color: #8bc34a;"">bleep</span></b> is targeted for people who can't use cloud

option to transfer all of your backup to your computer / cloud (password protected), to
‘backup your backup’, just in case.</p>
<p>Q: <b>What happens if my

<p>Israeli civilians have anywhere from 15 to 90 seconds to seek shelter when an alarm sounds, signaling an incoming rocket from the Gaza Strip.  With time being of the essence, Rocket Angel allows these innocent civilians to get their immediate proximity and direction to Gaza using an interactive compass, informing them the likely trajectory and direction of the incoming rocket.  </p>
<p>Our team consists of a few Israeli developers, as well as four American and French interns.  Although we come from very different backgrounds, we are all currently under the constant threat of a rocket attack, and find ourselves struggling to seek shelter during a rocket alarm as many as five or six times a day.  If away from home or out of the office, it is often extremely difficult to find a public bomb shelter, therefore making it a reality to seek shelter behind a building or in an alleyway.  The ultimate aim of this App is to help improve the safety of Israeli citizens during the stressful seconds of a rocket attack by providing them with an App to help them reach safety during times of unrest.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We're asking for $5,000 over the next thirty days to further develop our App to increase response time, improve reliability and add more data and features. Specifically, we are currently developing a feature that will enable users to add the location of bomb shelters, so that panicked users will be able to find the nearest shelter during a rocket attack.  Furthermore, people willing to offer their home or other safe places during a rocket attack will be able to post their location so people without a shelter will not be forced to endure the attack without shelter. Additionally, we aim to add a vibrating feature, so that people who cannot leave the sounds on their phone on during the day will never miss any important alerts or hazards.  Lastly, any leftover funding will be donated to the building of more bomb shelters throughout Israel.  This project was created solely to improve the safety of innocent civilians during dangerous rocket attacks, and we are not looking to profit in any way.</span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Rocket Angel will provide an essential tool to Israeli civilians in need of immediate assistance in seeking shelter during rocket attacks from the Gaza strip.  Your support will go directly to the further development of our app, which will in turn increase the means of safety for people searching for the optimal shelter during an impeding rocket attack.  Ultimately, we cannot solve the conflict in the Middle East, but it is our goal to help keep innocent civilians safe from the fighting by providing our free app to anybody in need.</div>
</div> <div> <h3>Our Vision</h3>
<ul></ul>
<div>Our true hope is that our app will be irrelevant by tomorrow, the Middle East Conflict will end, and no more rockets will ever be launched into Israel from the Gaza Strip.  However, this is not reality.  Rocket Angel aims to make the best of a bad situation, by ultimately helping to minimize the danger and risk faced by innocent Israeli civilians on a daily basis.</div>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you're unable to donate to our cause, you can still help! Share our story with your friends on Indiegogo, Facebook, Twitter and any other form of social media you can think of.  Every penny counts, and who knows, it could even save somebody's life!</p>

Our team consists of a few Israeli developers, as well as four American and French interns.  Although we come from very different backgrounds, we are all currently under the constant threat of a rocket attack, and find ourselves struggling to seek shelter during a rocket alarm as many as five or six times a day.  If away from home or out of the office, it is often extremely difficult to find a public bomb shelter, therefore making it a reality to seek shelter behind a building or in an alleyway.  The ultimate aim of this App is to help improve the safety of Israeli citizens during the stressful seconds of a rocket attack by providing them with an App to help them reach safety during times of unrest.   What We Need  We're asking for $5,000 over the next thirty days to further develop our App to increase response time, improve reliability and add more data and features. Specifically, we are currently developing a feature that will enable users to add the location of bomb shelters, so that panicked users will be able to find the nearest shelter during a rocket attack.  Furthermore, people willing to offer their home or other safe places during a rocket attack will be able to post their location so people without a shelter will not be forced to endure the attack without shelter. Additionally, we aim to add a vibrating feature, so that people who cannot leave the sounds on their phone on during the day will never miss any important alerts or hazards.  Lastly, any leftover funding will be donated to the building of more bomb shelters throughout Israel.  This project was created solely to improve the safety of innocent civilians during dangerous rocket attacks, and we are not looking to profit in any way.
  The Impact
Rocket Angel will provide an essential tool to Israeli civilians in need of immediate assistance in seeking shelter during rocket attacks from the Gaza strip.  Your support will go directly to the further development of our app, which will in turn increase the means of safety for people searching for the optimal shelter during an impeding rocket attack.  Ultimately, we cannot solve the conflict in the Middle East, but it is our goal to help keep innocent civilians safe from the fighting by providing our free app to anybody in need.
  Our Vision

Our true hope is that our app will be irrelevant by tomorrow, the Middle East Conflict will end, and no more rockets will ever be launched into Israel from the Gaza Strip.  However, this is not reality.  Rocket Angel aims to make the best of a bad situation, by ultimately helping to minimize the danger and risk faced by innocent Israeli civilians on a daily basis.
  Other Ways You Can Help Even if you're unable to donate to our cause, you can still help! Share our story with your friends on Indiegogo, Facebook, Twitter and any other form of social media you can think of.  Every penny counts, and who knows, it could even save somebody's life!

Gecko is a simple three-piece kit:  Gecko Connector, a tiny plug for your Lightning or Micro-USB port
Gecko Adapter, a magnetic adapter for your existing sync/charge cable

Gecko Dongle, a small dongle that transforms all your power-banks or USB port in a convenient wireless-style charging station.

Both Connectors and Dongles auto align themselves and start charging instantly
 



Gecko is small and thin enough to be applied to any smartphone with a Micro-USB port or a Lightning port. its adhesive surface will lock the connector directly to the mobile or on the bumper in a breeze.  Thanks to our specialized micro-connector, Gecko is so 
small it will fit into any custom phone case so you don’t have to ditch 
your favorite phone cover.

<p>BEAUTIFUL. SIMPLE. MODERN. CLEAN. SMART. <strong>SAFE.</strong></p>
<p>Every year, more than 100 children are killed by electrocution caused by unprotected outlets and over 2,400 suffer from severe injury due to electrocution in the home. PINCH Safe Outlet Cover, designed in Canada, has been created to prevent childhood electrocution and burns. In under 30 seconds, your current outlet cover can be replaced with the Safe Outlet Cover, resolving all of the safety and design gaps found in North American electrical outlets.</p>
<p>Once the PINCH Safe Outlet Cover is in place, you must use one hand to pinch the patent pending tabs to open the sliding doors and insert your plug. Children don’t have the strength or dexterity to perform this maneuver, and therefore are unable to access the outlet. PINCH Safe Outlet Cover delivers peace of mind that your electrical outlets are 100% childproof.<br/><br/>We haven’t sacrificed design for safety, either. The PINCH Safe Outlet Cover has been created with a modern, sophisticated look. You’ll feel at ease knowing your child is safe and the look of your outlets isn’t being compromised.</p>

<p>When my three-year-old son came to me holding the flimsy plastic plug cover we thought would prevent him from accessing an electrical outlet, I felt a surge of emotions and the fear of what could happen kept me awake all night.

<p>The manufacturing costs for PINCH were originally extremely high due to the requirement of creating both Duplex and Decora covers; essentially, two types of products are more expensive to make than one.

<p>During our early product testing, one customer pointed out that when one of the PINCH Safe Outlet Cover's tabs is pushed in, that side of the socket is unlocked, allowing a child to access the single opening.

<p><strong><i>What makes the PINCH Safe Outlet Cover so different from other outlet covers with sliding doors?</i></strong><br/>Other outlet covers with sliding doors require the user to manually slide the door across the outlet. These are easily manipulated by children. The PINCH Safe Outlet Cover's pinching mechanism is impossible for a small child to manoeuvre because they lack the dexterity and strength required to pinch with one hand and plug in with the other. </p>
<p><strong><i>Is it dangerous to swap my current outlet with the PINCH Outlet Cover?</i></strong><br/>Absolutely not! Because PINCH is only a cover, there’s no need to replace the actual outlet. No wires need to be accessed, meaning the installation process is both simple and completely safe!</p>
<p><strong><i>Will the PINCH Safe Outlet Cover look bulky on my wall?</i></strong><br/>No way! The PINCH Safe Outlet Cover is approximately the same size as standard outlet covers. Its exact dimensions are 3.13cm wide by 4.87cm tall by 0.33cm thick. It has been designed with aesthetics in mind with a modern, sleek appearance.</p>
<p><strong><i>Are children able to access the socket when they push in one tab?</i></strong><br/>No; both sliding doors remain locked until both tabs are pinched in at the same time.</p>
<p><strong><i>What if my PINCH Safe Outlet Cover breaks?</i></strong><br/>We're so confident your PINCH Safe Outlet Cover won't break that we're offering it with a 5-year warranty.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Any risks along the road?</b></td>
<td>Hardware projects need careful planning for getting the supply chain and manufacturing process right. In fact, that's almost as much work as developing the actual features of a device.<br/><br/>To avoid surprises, Pockethernet has been designed with mass production in mind from the very beginning. Parts have been selected with looking at stock estimates and we also keep in touch with our component distributors.<br/>However, even the shortage of a single component can adversely affect our delivery dates.<br/><br/>To make sure that the product doesn't fail on regulatory issues, we use pre-certified components and industry best practices for EMC.<br/><br/>A successful mass production run has been planned from early on. All the parts are designed for line manufacturing, and we work together with manufacturers we already know. Even the prototypes have been manufactured on an automated SMT line.<br/>However, there are also significant risks in finishing the development and preparing for production. For example, failing on a regulatory test or the purchasing delay of a single component can add weeks to the delivery date. With pre-ordering, you agree that these risks can delay the shipment date of your perk or cause a limitation of features.<br/><br/>To ensure the quality of shipped Pockethernet devices, each of them undergo extensive physical and electrical tests and get their own calibration.<br/><br/>For quality, timing and environmental reasons, Pockethernet is manufactured in Europe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Can I ask for a Pockethernet in other ways during the campaign?</b></td>
<td>Sure! You can state your interest in any available perk with the same conditions by just emailing us. You also have the option of paying at delivery, via bank transfer later on, or net after receiving the invoice in eligible cases.</td>

  For all those interested in the device, check out the huge discounts!Those who would like to support us without buying the device, should check out this nice tote bag:Where are we now?In the last 12 months, we have been developing the hardware, the embedded firmware and the smartphone application to test the product.There is already a production-quality prototype device, with all the functions tested and verified. The hardware was manufactured on an SMT line and the enclosure is the 3D-printed version of the final mould model. All is looking great so far!What do we need the funds for?Bringing a hardware product to the market involves a huge initial investment. We have been financing the development ourselves until now, but we need support for:
Making the injection mould tooling for the enclosure
Getting the hardware certified for EMC and safety standards
Finishing the embedded and phone application software development
Setting up manufacturing and ordering the first large batch of hardware components

Technical 

Which phones and tablets are compatible?
Pockethernet is compatible with all Android devices having Bluetooth.


Which version of Android do I need?
The app should be compatible with all versions


Are you planning iOS support?
Yes, if we reach a certain funding goal that makes it possible to upgrade Pockethernet to Bluetooth v4 and to develop an iOS application.


Can I use pockethernet without a phone/tablet?
Pockethernet has a basic user interface made up by RGB LEDs. They show basic information about the cable (pass/fail/failure type) and the network (link/DHCP status). So you can have a quick look even without using your phone.


How about wiremap adapters?
Pockethernet comes with a built-in wiremap port, so you can connect both ends of the cable to the tester for wiremap measurement.We plan to offer our own wiremap adapters with IDs after the campaign, and will also try to make Pockethernet compatible with existing wiremap adapters you may already have.


Payment/shipment 

Why is the shipping restricted to US/EU?
As a hardware product, Pockethernet needs to comply with regulatory requirements. We need to assess these country-by-country which takes time and money. If you are interested in buying Pockethernet outside of these countries, sign up for a notification on our website: www.pockethernet.com



Can I order for a company? Will I get an invoice?
Sure, each shipment will include a commercial invoice.If you are ordering for a company, please start the shipping name with the string 'COMPANY'. If you are ordering for a european company, also look at the question below.


Why do EU customers need to add VAT?
Pockethernet is made by a company registered in the EU and is required by law to charge VAT on its sales.However, if you are ordering on behalf of a european company with a valid VAT ID, you don't need to add VAT to your perk.


I forgot to add shipping costs or VAT. What do I do?
Simply back us with the required additional amount. Make sure to use the same name and address. After the campaign ends, we'll check through the addresses and perks and get back to anyone who needs to match up the perk.


How do I supply my VAT ID and company name?
Don't worry, after the campaign ends, we'll send a survey to fill in the missing bits.


Can I buy pockethernet after the Indiegogo campaign?
Yes, we plan to continue manufacturing and selling Pockethernet.Sign up for post-campaign notifications on our website: www.pockethernet.com



Do I have to pay for the app?
The application will be provided for free with all the current features listed on the campaign page.Additional features may need a paid app or an in app purchase.


I have some questions / feedback for you!
Great! Feel free to drop us an email at Indiegogo@pockethernet.com


Will the product have any warranty?
Pockethernet comes with a standard limited 1 year warranty


Any risks along the road?
Hardware projects need careful planning for getting the supply chain and manufacturing process right. In fact, that's almost as much work as developing the actual features of a device.To avoid surprises, Pockethernet has been designed with mass production in mind from the very beginning. Parts have been selected with looking at stock estimates and we also keep in touch with our component distributors.However, even the shortage of a single component can adversely affect our delivery dates.To make sure that the product doesn't fail on regulatory issues, we use pre-certified components and industry best practices for EMC.A successful mass production run has been planned from early on. All the parts are designed for line manufacturing, and we work together with manufacturers we already know. Even the prototypes have been manufactured on an automated SMT line.However, there are also significant risks in finishing the development and preparing for production. For example, failing on a regulatory test or the purchasing delay of a single component can add weeks to the delivery date. With pre-ordering, you agree that these risks can delay the shipment date of your perk or cause a limitation of features.To ensure the quality of shipped Pockethernet devices, each of them undergo extensive physical and electrical tests and get their own calibration.For quality, timing and environmental reasons, Pockethernet is manufactured in Europe.


Can I ask for a Pockethernet in other ways during the campaign?
Sure! You can state your interest in any available perk with the same conditions by just emailing us. You also have the option of paying at delivery, via bank transfer later on, or net after receiving the invoice in eligible cases.


 

Legal notice: This is not a sales contract. By selecting a perk, you merely show your interest in ordering a device. The sales contract will only be established once the device is delivered or we make a separate agreement. You allow the fulfillment by and transfer of the agreement to a party designated by the project owner. Contact us, if you wish a refund.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

Must-have for extended use and enjoyment of all smartphones and tablets.

Powerful: the rechargeable Dense Lithium battery has 2 to 4 X the power of other ""Slim"", ""Skinny"", ""Hyper"" chargers, and can charge phones at 1 A, up to 1% per minute, to nearly 100% (depending on the battery capacity).  While we could have made it 2 A, tests showed that it made the phone too hot to be worth the small difference in speed.

Smart: automatically starts charging when plugged in-no switches to break
The Best Solution: iPhones, and most smartphones do not have removable batteries.  Cases with batteries add weight and bulk, and change the design aesthetics.  External battery packs have long cables and are bulky.  Other card chargers have as little as 25% power.

Other card chargers have fancy names and colorful cases.  We are sure that you only care that has the most power and is the most durable and affordable.

<p>SmartAds is an innovative new smartphone app that will allow you to get <strong>paid every month</strong> for having sleek, good looking, minimalistic ads displaying on your phones lockscreen... effectively allowing you to make money from your own personal billboard. To begin with we expect that to be up to $25 per month that will be paid straight to you - we hope that in the early stages we will also have options to have the wireless provider paid directly so it's subtracted from your bill...or added to your pre-pay balance! Tablets would double this.</p>
<p>Ads will be targeted to you based on your interests and will often offer deals that will be attractive to you (ie a traveler might be excited to see half-price flights being offered to a favorite destination today or this week only). You will be able to interact with the advertisement immediately to take advantage of one you don't want to miss and they will be easily shareable to friends and family so they don't miss out either.</p>
<p>There won't be any noticeable battery drain or data usage, and no personal user details will be shared with advertisers.</p>
<p>We want the app to be as unintrusive as possible, so closing the ad to view your normal lockscreen will be a simple close button positioned where you'd normally be expecting to unlock your screen anyway, therefore taking less than a second away from normal phone operation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is funds to get the app finished and implement the marketing strategy to major advertising agencies/media buyers for their clients to start using this new advertising medium.</p>
<p>As a founding user you'll get a SmartAds lifetime higher percentage of an advertisers spend paid back to you than all other subsequent users. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A recent Wall Street Journal article stated that ""Families across America have cut back on food, clothes and entertainment to make room for ever-higher phone bills. Now, carriers are betting that they can push that bill even higher""</p>
<p>This is a way for people to reduce that monthly expense without having to change anything more than a single screen tap about how you use your phone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We'll be implementing a referral program where you'll be able to receive even more every month by bringing your friend onboard. There will be no limit to how many people you bring on and therefore the amount you recieve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong></p>

</div></div>","SmartAds is an innovative new smartphone app that will allow you to get paid every month for having sleek, good looking, minimalistic ads displaying on your phones lockscreen... effectively allowing you to make money from your own personal billboard. To begin with we expect that to be up to $25 per month that will be paid straight to you - we hope that in the early stages we will also have options to have the wireless provider paid directly so it's subtracted from your bill...or added to your pre-pay balance! Tablets would double this.
Ads will be targeted to you based on your interests and will often offer deals that will be attractive to you (ie a traveler might be excited to see half-price flights being offered to a favorite destination today or this week only). You will be able to interact with the advertisement immediately to take advantage of one you don't want to miss and they will be easily shareable to friends and family so they don't miss out either.
There won't be any noticeable battery drain or data usage, and no personal user details will be shared with advertisers.
We want the app to be as unintrusive as possible, so closing the ad to view your normal lockscreen will be a simple close button positioned where you'd normally be expecting to unlock your screen anyway, therefore taking less than a second away from normal phone operation.


What We Need & What You Get
What we need is funds to get the app finished and implement the marketing strategy to major advertising agencies/media buyers for their clients to start using this new advertising medium.
As a founding user you'll get a SmartAds lifetime higher percentage of an advertisers spend paid back to you than all other subsequent users. 
The Impact


A recent Wall Street Journal article stated that ""Families across America have cut back on food, clothes and entertainment to make room for ever-higher phone bills. Now, carriers are betting that they can push that bill even higher""
This is a way for people to reduce that monthly expense without having to change anything more than a single screen tap about how you use your phone.


Other Ways You Can Help
We'll be implementing a referral program where you'll be able to receive even more every month by bringing your friend onboard. There will be no limit to how many people you bring on and therefore the amount you recieve.

<p> </p>
<div>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">What about compatibility with international power plugs?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">There are two models available. One for the US based outlet:</span></p>
</div>
<p>[US] 120V AC 60Hz<br/><br/>and one for the rest of the world:<br/><br/>[EU] 220V AC 50Hz.<br/>In combination with the included universal travel adaptor-plug, you will be able to use it with any type of plug, anywhere in the world!</p>
<p>No idea what this means? Don’t worry, we will automatically ship you the standard outlet for your region.<br/><br/>If however you do have specific requirements, you can select the model you desire upon checkout.</p>
<p><b>Are there any restrictions for carrying the A² on an airplane?</b></p>
<p>No. You can take the A² with you without any problem as either checked luggage or carry-on baggage.<br/>Below 100 Wh there are no restrictions for built-in li-ion batteries. The LifePower A² features a capacity of 94,7Wh.</p>
<p>We’ve also included the exact referred IATA and FAA regulations in the User Guide to avoid any possible hold up by airline officials.</p>
<p><b>How do I recharge the A2?</b></p>
<p>Each A2 includes a dedicated charger and if you wish to charge with solar power you can hook up the SUN2 solarpack!<br/>A micro USB charge input is also available for compatibility with a wide range of mobile charging devices.</p>
<p><b>How long does it take to recharge the A2?</b></p>
<p>A full charge requires 3 hours with the supplied charger, however an 80% state of charge can be achieved in only 2 hours.<br/>This also counts for the SUN2 solarpack, in optimal weather conditions.</p>
<p>Take notice that charging the A2 with a microUSB charger might take up to 20h.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What about safety?</b></p>
<p>The device is compliant to CE (LVD and EMC) and FCC regulations regarding safety. If you would plug in a device that demands too much current or in case of a short circuit, the overload safety will switch on automatically to protect you and the device.</p>
<p><b>Are your products weatherproof?</b></p>
<p>It is not advised to expose our products to water, dust or direct sunlight. Besides -ofcourse- t<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">he SUN2 solarpack which is splashwater AND sunproof ;)</span></p>
<p><b>What’s inside the A2’s box?</b></p>
<p>Besides the A2 itself, you will also find:</p>
<ul>
<li>A velvet bag</li>
<li>The User Guide and Quick Start Guide</li>
<li>The dedicated charger (in some regions incl. replaceable plug)</li>

</div><p> </p><p> </p></div>","Our campaign for the LIFEPOWR A3 is now LIVE!a Future Proofed, updated version of the A2 that integrated the new USB-C Power Delivery standard.  There are a lot of different portable battery packs out there, but they are all limited to charging only USB powered devices (such as cell phones and tablets). So we decided to come up with a solution that can power up Anything.  www.lifepower.be We made a US & Global model so you can use it with any plug, all over the world!

 
There might not even be one, like in a park:Imagine that you are dreaming about your next holiday......interrupted by a low battery.Thanks to your Lifepower A² there is no need to look for an outlet, just take it with you, anywhere you go. 
 
Easy to use 
One push on the button will power your thirsty device and it will show you its remaining capacity.
 
Store EnergyYou can simply recharge the A² in only 3 hours from your AC outlet or from solar power using our SUN2 Solar Pack! Become completely energy independent.
 
 

The LifePower A² was designed to be as powerful as possible, both in wattage and capacity, but still compact and lightweight so that it remains easy to carry around with you.
 
You could see it as a silent, solid-state and portable generator. The perfect blend between generator and powerbank.
 

 

 
 
What Can I Power?The options are endless, but we've given a few examples below:

 
 
 The AC outlet delivers 100 Watt continuously, 120 Watt peak
 
 
That's LOUD.

How we created the A2Long days of planning, calculating, drawing, testing, ....
Up to a 3D print to get a feel of the design and finally a working prototype!Testing
The product is extensively tested by certified testing labs to ensure that it complies with the necessary conformity regulations. Timeline & FundingIts is a long journey from idea to final product and it takes a lot of hard work and a serious investment. Costs for development, prototyping, moulds and the necessary production tools are high. If we do not reach our projected goal of $29K we will not be able to get the LIFEPOWER A² into your hands.The Risks & ChallengesOne potential challenge is that the final development stages as well as setting up the production line could take much longer than expected. We've intentionally set a generous timeline for these stages of the process based on where we currently stand. We hope we'll finish sooner, but we want to allow plenty of time in case it's needed.Through all of this, we'll communicate often and clearly with our backers on where we are in the process. We'll also be here to answer any questions you have about the product and about how things are going.

 FAQs
 

What about compatibility with international power plugs?
There are two models available. One for the US based outlet:

[US] 120V AC 60Hzand one for the rest of the world:[EU] 220V AC 50Hz.In combination with the included universal travel adaptor-plug, you will be able to use it with any type of plug, anywhere in the world!
No idea what this means? Don’t worry, we will automatically ship you the standard outlet for your region.If however you do have specific requirements, you can select the model you desire upon checkout.
Are there any restrictions for carrying the A² on an airplane?
No. You can take the A² with you without any problem as either checked luggage or carry-on baggage.Below 100 Wh there are no restrictions for built-in li-ion batteries. The LifePower A² features a capacity of 94,7Wh.
We’ve also included the exact referred IATA and FAA regulations in the User Guide to avoid any possible hold up by airline officials.
How do I recharge the A2?
Each A2 includes a dedicated charger and if you wish to charge with solar power you can hook up the SUN2 solarpack!A micro USB charge input is also available for compatibility with a wide range of mobile charging devices.
How long does it take to recharge the A2?
A full charge requires 3 hours with the supplied charger, however an 80% state of charge can be achieved in only 2 hours.This also counts for the SUN2 solarpack, in optimal weather conditions.
Take notice that charging the A2 with a microUSB charger might take up to 20h.
 
What about safety?
The device is compliant to CE (LVD and EMC) and FCC regulations regarding safety. If you would plug in a device that demands too much current or in case of a short circuit, the overload safety will switch on automatically to protect you and the device.
Are your products weatherproof?
It is not advised to expose our products to water, dust or direct sunlight. Besides -ofcourse- the SUN2 solarpack which is splashwater AND sunproof ;)
What’s inside the A2’s box?
Besides the A2 itself, you will also find:

A velvet bag
The User Guide and Quick Start Guide
The dedicated charger (in some regions incl. replaceable plug)
The Universal adapter (supplied only with the EU/Global model)

I have a specific brand laptop. Can LifePower charge it?Is it independent from the type of laptop I have?
Yes, the LifePower A2 can charge any type of laptop.
However, it only supports a power rating up to 120W (this can be found on the backside/label of your adapter)Some high performance/gaming devices draw more power and can thus only be charged in ‘power saving’ mode or when shut down.Can I power my product X [Amplifier/Lamp/Charger/TV/...] ?This will depend on a few factors, such as power consumption.Most devices that draw less then 120W or 120VA will work correctly. (This can be found on the specifications label)Please do note that some devices will need a pure sine wave and that the A2's output waveform is a modified sine wave (PWM) designed to emulate a pure sinewave.

WHY
DOES A PC/USB PORT CHARGE SO SLOW?
A regular USB cable is
made to communicate (transfer data) and to act as a power supply between your
USB port and your device.

When you connect your device
(i.e. phone, table, etc.) to your USB port (on your laptop or in your car), USB
port automatically prepares to communicate with your device and provide limited
electric energy:  to sync AND charge.  Simply
put, attempting to transfer data and charge at the same time is the main reason
why charging is so slow.

THE
SOLUTION 
Turning the switch ON to DBTmode
results in faster charging time for your device when plugged into your computer
or USB port in your car.
FAST
CHARGING AND SECURE
An added bonus of DBTCharging Cable-it protects your personal and private data
stored on your devices by blocking data connection. When DBT mode is turned ON,
the cable prevents accidental data exchange when your device is plugged into a

<p>When your mobile device is plugged into a computer's USB port, your standard charging cable syncs and charges at the same time, which results in very slow charging rates.  </p>
<p>Unlike standard charging cables featuring both data and syncing capabilities, LiteWire's charge-only feature makes sure you don't waste your precious time charging your phone forever. This means that all the power available will be used to boost the charging speed <i>up to</i> 2x faster - for those times you are away from the wall.</p>

</div></div>","As we grow with our devices, daily tasks have become much easier. We use them for almost everything we do.However, our devices rely on batteries and more often than not, these batteries are unable to hold a charge long enough to get you through the day.LiteWire is a simple yet ingenious solution to this problem. LiteWire not only charges your devices up to 2x faster than standard charging cables, but it also protects it from any accidental data transfer or data theft. What's even better is that is that it easily fits in your pocket and it's tough enough to take on a 5000 lb minivan!Now you’ll have access to a reliable charging cable whenever you need it!LiteWire is universal and recognizes no boundaries. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you're from. It doesn't matter whether you use an iPhone, Blackberry, Windows, or Android - as long as you’re a mobile device user, LiteWire is for you.Because LiteWire features both microUSB and Lightning connectors, it can charge 90% of the devices on the market. 




Whether you are an iOS, Android, Blackberry, or Windows user, LiteWire is your ultimate dual charging cable. It can charge approximately 90% of the devices available in the market.That means you'll never need to carry two separate cables for your devices anymore.




LiteWire is a more convenient alternative to bulky charging cables. With the size of a car key, you can easily attach it to your key-chain and never again worry forgetting your charging cable at home.




Which charging cable would you rather bring with you when you're on the go? 
A long bulky cable that can barely fit in your pocket or a compact dual charging cable that can easily attach to your keys? We think the answer is pretty obvious.






LiteWire's protective shell and reinforced flat cable will guarantee you a long-lasting and profitable partnership. No more connectors falling off or cables peeling from collective usage.






To test how extremely durable LiteWire is, we ran it over by a 5,690 lb minivan multiple times and it was still functional. It's as tough as a tank!






When your mobile device is plugged into a computer's USB port, your standard charging cable syncs and charges at the same time, which results in very slow charging rates.  
Unlike standard charging cables featuring both data and syncing capabilities, LiteWire's charge-only feature makes sure you don't waste your precious time charging your phone forever. This means that all the power available will be used to boost the charging speed up to 2x faster - for those times you are away from the wall.

Charging speed is measured using the unit of Ampere-hour(Ah). To demonstrate the difference in charging speeds between LiteWire and a standard charging cable, we used a USB meter and tested various devices as well as various power sources.

Based on the test results above, 6 out of 8 times LiteWire charged mobile devices at least 2x faster than regular charging cables when plugged into non-wall plug power sources.



NOTE: The fast charge function only applies to non-wall plug power sources. Wall plug chargers do not sync your device, therefore it already charges your phone as fast as possible. In addition, newer iPhones can charge up to 2.1A from a USB port using the regular cable when it's plugged into newer Mac computers.



We know how important it is for you to feel safe when charging your devices when you're out and about. When you're using public charging ports, hackers can easily steal your photos, videos, banking information, contacts, and a lot more. 
That's why we blocked the data feature of LiteWire, making it impossible for unknown devices to gain unauthorized access to your phone and tablet, steal your data, or install malware on your mobile device. 
You can think of LiteWire as the SyncStop/USB Condom of compact charging cables. It does the exact same thing.
In other words, LiteWire can save you from juice jacking.

</div></div>","There are a lot of different tasks managers, to-do lists and other apps for productivity. But all of them forget one thing, one main thing for every single action — Motivation. So as a very enthusiastic group of students, we know that we do need motivation for our everyday life tasks. So, we created Fillip App, an app with intuative UI that gives you motivation for your tasks by relevant motivational phrases. All this creates a very unique way to raise your productivity.If we get your financial support, we will create a special reward system which will make you even more productive with your future goals. In addition, we will design customized themes and make a detailed sound design in order to make your productivity grow way faster.Trying to get final product done, we could not eliminate a financial side of the process. We do need your support for hiring designers and coders in order to present a product of great quality to our future users. We will implement awesome features like geolocation, so you could link your task to the place you want. In addition to that, we will make an app version for Android and Apple Watch. Did we mention a Slack Bot? Moreover, we will need to cover some taxes & fees.

<h2><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>As with any product going into production involves certain are risks, but we have worked hard to minimize those risks. For example, production delays which can be a result of various things: holidays, shipping delays, the need to order a new stock of leather.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>In order
to minimize these risks, we offer now only the colors we have in stock. We will
widen the selection in our stretched goals. If we see that we are reaching our
first goal we will start working on the orders without waiting for the campaign
to end. We know that many campaigns fail to deliver on time, so we worked hard
to minimize this risk. We already invested in the cutting tools that we need
for production of the iPhone 6/6s case, and manufactured a portion of the amount so we know that
everything is working good and ready to go! We made great effort to ensure that
the early birds for the iphone 6/6s will be delivered on time. We are capable of manufacturing up
to 1000 cases per month. If we exceed this amount in our campaign, we already
have a secondary manufacture line that can double the quantity, in that case we
might have delays with delivering the late backers products. The delay time depends
on the extra amount of cases we will need to manufacture, and we will do our best effort
to minimize this delay time!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Developing the Guardian Case for the Galaxy S6, S6 edge, S7 and the
Guardian Case II can take a few month. We currently only offer the Guardian
Case for iPhone 6/6s in our perks. We will keep you updated when other models
become available.</p>

Cult of mac- ""The Guardian Leather is a functional leather iPhone case, specifically for 6 and 6s. It looks good, it — dare I say one more time — smells good, it feels good in your hand, and for a wallet case it’s quite protective of the iPhone. Plus the side flap for wrapping cords is a win.""
I Am Alpha Men- ""This Leather Case is the ULTIMATE""
""So there ya go. It's a phone case, wallet, and media player all in one highly modern, yet classic, protective leather case... the stylish answer to carrying all of that *stuff*""
MindHungry- ""As for folio cases, there is not many that combine quality and value, but the Guardian nails that.""
Our VisionOur vision is to create a 100% leather case, which is functional, easy to handle, and non-irritating to use. Our case will ensure your phone is fully protected while maintaining an exclusive design and feel.Premium Quality Leather We have combined high quality, handmade leather work with advanced micro-suction technology, to create the ultimate leather phone case!Most leather cases have a cheap plastic framework which ruins the appearance and the concept of the leather case. Other leather cases are poorly designed and don't allow you to place your phone into the case with ease. And while some cases may look good, they fail to fully protect your phone as they claim. Micro-Suction TechnologyThe micro-suction pad consists of millions of microscopic suction cups that attach the phone with a vacuum; they hold the phone really tight and yet allow you to take it out easily without leaving any marks or sticky stuff on the back of your phone. You can repeat this action over and over again without wearing out the material.Attach and remove in seconds:

Protective Leather CornersWe worked really hard to design specialist leather corners to protect your phone, as we discovered that in many instances the cases were using a cheap looking plastic frame, or otherwise leaving the phone unprotected on the corners.The corners are strong and durable, made with a high-quality cutting and sewing process to a very high standard of finish.These corners make it easy to place your phone in the exact position when taking it in or out of the case.It Is a Wallet!As you already carry your phone around with you at all times, why not eliminate the need for carrying around your wallet as well? Well, the Guardian case does just that with a built in credit card slot! 


Media Player
The Guardian case is versatile and flexible, allowing you to use it as a fully featured media player and watch your media on the go. 





For Music Lover
If you like to listen to your music when you are on the go- the Guardian Case has the best solution for you. Easily wrap the headphone cords around the case without the hassle.



Meticulously DesignedThe Guardian case has been meticulously designed to fit perfectly your phone. The exact camera cut out, volume buttons, corner protectors are just part of the features that speak volume of the design. 





We need your help

To bring this project to full production, we need a minimum of a 1,000 orders to manufacture at a reasonable price, covering the costs involved in a full-scale production. We offer you the opportunity to pre-order the Guardian Case, enjoying a 40% discount off retail price, which will be approximately 75$, as you are buying this directly from us; and because we appreciate your help !

Our Perks




*Available only for iPhone 6/6s. 


Stretch Goals
With your help we will be able to continue and develop the Guardian Case for other devices, and add more features to our products as there is so much more potential in this product! We will only be able to do it with your support!
We have additional ideas and solutions that we are currently working on, for making life easier, particularly in regards of the use of Smartphones in vehicles.






Win a free case in two simple steps:


1.Log in to IndieGoGo if you have not already, or create an

2. Look below the main video to copy and share
your unique URL.






Production Plan:





Our design for the Guardian Case is finalised, our manufacturers are waiting for us to submit our order. For this to happen, we need your support to raise the necessary finances to meet our minimum order quantity.


Risks & Challenges

As with any product going into production involves certain are risks, but we have worked hard to minimize those risks. For example, production delays which can be a result of various things: holidays, shipping delays, the need to order a new stock of leather.



In order
to minimize these risks, we offer now only the colors we have in stock. We will
widen the selection in our stretched goals. If we see that we are reaching our
first goal we will start working on the orders without waiting for the campaign
to end. We know that many campaigns fail to deliver on time, so we worked hard
to minimize this risk. We already invested in the cutting tools that we need
for production of the iPhone 6/6s case, and manufactured a portion of the amount so we know that
everything is working good and ready to go! We made great effort to ensure that
the early birds for the iphone 6/6s will be delivered on time. We are capable of manufacturing up
to 1000 cases per month. If we exceed this amount in our campaign, we already
have a secondary manufacture line that can double the quantity, in that case we
might have delays with delivering the late backers products. The delay time depends
on the extra amount of cases we will need to manufacture, and we will do our best effort
to minimize this delay time!



Developing the Guardian Case for the Galaxy S6, S6 edge, S7 and the
Guardian Case II can take a few month. We currently only offer the Guardian
Case for iPhone 6/6s in our perks. We will keep you updated when other models
become available.













Design & development process
We went through a long journey of planning, designing, manufacturing, testing and examining various types of prototypes until we were able to come up with the final design and the best leather for the Guardian Case. And all this to ensure that our product gives the highest level of protection for the phone, easy to use and style. For us quality is the most important! We worked with different luxurious leather manufacturers to find the one that had the best quality. We were not willing to compromise on less than perfect!

<h1>Q&amp;A</h1>
<div>
<p><strong><strong>How will this help me?<br/></strong></strong>Unlike email, text messages, and Facebook messages, which are sent in the clear and can be easily hacked, we use military grade encryption to protect your messages from hackers. And we protect your privacy. We don't hand over information to the NSA like many big Internet companies do.</p>
<p><strong>What is the advantage of this over Skype?<br/></strong>We will be offering a higher level of encryption and security and we don't keep your key (to unocking your data), you do. We don't participate in the NSA's PRISM program. We don't eat up your computer and Internet bandwith. We have a web-based version, which is super convenient. </p>
<p><strong><strong>What is the advantage over</strong> Facebook messages?<br/></strong>All messages on Facebook are sent in the clear so anyone can intercept them. Facebook keeps all your messages. On Unsene all your messages are encrypted with military grade encyrption and we will be offering an even higher level of encryption and security. We don't keep your key (to unocking your data), you do. We don't participate in the NSA's PRISM program.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the advantage of this over Tor?<br/></strong>Tor is for anonymous Internet browsing. Unsene isn't for browsing the Internet or anonymizing. This is for securely communicating with others and creating your own secure, private networks.</p>
<p><strong>Do you keep log files of calls?  </strong><br/>No. We don't keep log files on calls. The history is purged within 7 days.</p>
<p><strong>Do you keep an archive of my messages?<br/></strong>No. Everything is purged in 7 days. In the premium version, you can store them longer if you want to.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>How do I know I can trust you?<br/></strong>Check us out under our team at end of the description. You can talk to people who have done business with us and they will tell you our track record.</p>
<p><strong>Will you share my info with anyone and how do I know you won't?<br/></strong>No, we won't share it. Privacy is at the heart of our business. You can read our privacy policy and terms of service. Also, we don't keep your keys, so we couldn't access your messages even if we wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>Does this have secure email?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, it does not have a regular email address, but there will be an email gateway in the not too distant future. Email is incredibly insecure, which mean it's not only read, but it's blocked and can even be altered in mid stream and you don't know it. We've got a Secure Email area in the web site that allows you to send an encrypted message to someone who has email, but doesn't have unsene yet. It's an email with a link to a page on our site with the encrypted message, which is revealed once they enter the correct password. The future email gateway will allow people<br/>to send and receive and respond to these secure emails and you'll even<br/>have your own unsene email account if you'd like. We're still working<br/>out those details, but that's the direction we're headed.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a way to send messages to several people in a group?</strong><br/>Yes, we have group functions. You can text message to a group and share<br/>files with groups. We're hoping to have publish / subscribe working<br/>this week. That'll mean you can replace your listserve emails with<br/>Unsene. No more ""spam filters"" by ISP's or others...</p>
<p><strong>Can it be used for group skype-type calls?</strong><br/>Not yet, but we're working on this as we speak. Today, we have one to<br/>one Skype type audio calls. I think we'll have something this week or<br/>next. We've also got video calls in the works, which work for one to<br/>one today and we hope to have them working for groups shortly after we<br/>have the audio group calls.</p>
<p><strong>Is file-sharing like an email attachment? (obviously i have never used any file-sharing program)</strong><br/>It works a lot like Skype, but it's also like email, because it uses our<br/>central server to store and forward your file. You just choose the<br/>person you want to send it to from your contacts and click ""Share"", then<br/>choose the file you want to send. The file is encrypted, then sent to<br/>our server and picked up by your recipient anywhere from immediately<br/>(it's real time) or whenever they come back online. We'll even send<br/>them an email to remind them they have a file waiting to be picked up. <br/>There's a 100MB limit we've artificially imposed, but we expect to get<br/>that raised quite a bit, once we also have peer to peer. In the near<br/>future, with publish / subscribe, you'll be able to put a file to a<br/>group and anyone in the group will have access to it. Fully encrypted<br/>of course.</p>
<p><strong>What's the developer version for?</strong><br/>The $97 level is for developers, that would be someone who wants to eventually develop applications using an API.</p>

<h1>What Unsene can't do.</h1>
<div> </div>
<p>That being said, here's what Unsene can't do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>It can't make your insecure emails secure</strong>. Email is inherently insecure because it travels through many servers. Also, even if you were to encrypt your email, the headers such as to, from, and subject line would still be sent in the clear. In contrast, Unsene was designed from the ground up as an end-to-end encrypted and secure service that can deliver messages in real time.</li>
<li>
<strong>It can't protect you if you are breaking the law</strong>: If we are notified by authorities that you are using Unsene to a commit criminal act, then your account could be terminated.</li>
</ul><div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h1>How It Works</h1>

<p> </p>

<li>
<strong>Military-grade security</strong> protects your important private messages, photos and videos, everywhere. It's so strong that we can't export it to Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and North Korea.</li>

<h1>Why Unsene Is A Necessity Now</h1>
<p><em>“Free speech is the whole thing, the whole ball game. Free speech is life itself.</em><em>” </em>—Salman Rushdie, author</p>
<p>Over the years, <em>people’s personal rights, privacy, and freedom have slowly been eroding</em>. And now, with the recent revelations about the NSA, more than ever, personal privacy and security are at the forefront of people’s minds here in the U.S.</p>
<p>Plus, in places around the world, where people’s lives depend ability to communicate on the Internet, where it could finally secure freedom, the government has tried to shut down social media and search engines.</p>
<p><strong> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/912391/pictures/full/20130705162051-Unsene_video_intro_-_communicate_with_freedom_-_Screenshot_6_29_13_6_37_PM.png?1373067054"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><em>Have you ever wondered what would happen if <strong>suddenly people everywhere in the world could communicate securely without being monitored and get uncensored information?</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, a few of us did and we thought it might lead to <em><strong>the</strong> <strong>fastest expansion of freedom of speech and human rights the world has ever seen</strong>! A world where people would no longer have to live in fear.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Content delivery</strong>: There will also be an edition where <em>people will be able to subscribe to your feed</em> like an email list or microblogging service and you can build a subscriber base. So you could use it instead of your existing email list, where the delivery rate is low. With Unsene, you’ll get <em>way better delivery rate compared to email, because it can't be being blocked by ISPs or spam filters like email can.</em>

<p><em> </em></p>
<h1>Our Story</h1>
<div>When the Internet first began, everyone was excited about the possibilities it opened to connect with others, be it friends, family, or like minded people around the world. When we got our first internet account and joined the worldwide community of people, we could share interests, ideas and chat with people thousands of miles away. <strong>The Internet was a place of exploration, of free expression, of discovery.</strong> A place before words like <em>Internet freedom, Internet censorship, Internet privacy</em> existed, because they didn’t need to.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Slowly over time, as <strong>bigger corporations and bigger government took hold</strong> of things, the excitement, the freedom, and the privacy of Internet began to erode.<strong>People felt betrayed.</strong> Until the world got to the point where we are today, where we<em>began to feel imprisoned</em> by the very thing that used to give us a sense of freedom.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Frustrated with the spying on or hacking into our text messages, emails, and calls</strong>, our team at Unsene wanted a way where we could communicate freely, where what you said or wrote was only sent to the person you addressed it to. <strong>Where you don't have to worry</strong> about being censored -- because if someone in the middle could read your message, they could also block it.  <strong>Where you could say what you wanted</strong>, when you wanted, where you wanted, without any repercussions. <strong>Where you had privacy. Where you had security.  Where you had freedom.</strong></p>
<div> </div>
<p>That’s not the reality of life on the Internet today. Instead, it seems that everything we use and trust has <strong>serious privacy issues</strong>, be it texting on our cell phone,using webmail, sending messages on social media, or chatting on instant messaging services. If it isn’t <em>Russian hackers</em>, it’s the companies themselves, business competitors, even the <em>NSA </em>and governments.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>Even worse, in some countries, <strong>social media and major Internet services are completely blocked</strong>. It isn’t just the Internet that is shut down, but <em>freedom of speech is squelched altogether.</em></p>
<div> </div>
<p>Our team looked, but we couldn’t find any <strong>consumer-friendly secure chat, messaging, voice, and photo sharing app</strong>. And there certainly wasn’t a mainstream messaging app <em>with good security.</em></p>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Things that were supposed to be secure ended up not being so.</strong> Many companies have been forced to turn over information to the government. Many articles spoke about certain internet chat and voice calling servicespossibly having a backdoor in the U.S. just as it did already in China. Then, the news hit of the big <strong>technology’s company's participation in NSA’s surveillance program</strong> and it became clear that humungous amounts of communications were being turned over to the  NSA.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/912727/pictures/full/20130705205512-PRISMbriefingS2HApr2013_v1_0_cropped.png?1373082917"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<div>
<em>The secure options that did exist were way too expensive</em>, built for corporations, and large institutions where money was no object. That’s not what people wanted. How could you ever convince our friends and family that the only way to talk to us was to pony up for some high-priced service?</div>
<div> </div>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>the low cost options were way too complicated</strong>. Some services took hours to set up, and still it never worked correctly, before it got shelved when it was acquired by a big company. The rest were like tech toys, not made for regular people.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>There needed to be something secure where we <em>you could just login to to the website</em>without having to install anything, like webmail and online social media services.<strong>Something that was so simple</strong> that even our parents or grandparents could use it without an instruction manual.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>Our team dreamed of something that was <em>as easy to use as Skype, Facebook, or Viber, was super secure using top secret level encryption, had a low cost version, and also a pro version for people who needed extra security, and worked on every platform, even the web.</em> It would be <strong>a simple, secure and private communications platform and community. </strong>And what we wanted just didn’t exist.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Having built some of the Earth’s most trafficked websites</strong> (e.g., top 10 in the world) and <em>ran mission critical communications</em> (e.g., Motorola, AT&amp;T), our team felt that we were the ones that had to do it. That we had to make the dreams a reality.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>The Product</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>So our team began building. It’s taken us 2 years and we are proud to say that we have built t<strong>he first encrypted, web-based service for messaging, voice and video calls, and file sharing!</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/912387/pictures/full/20130705161948-Features___Unlimited_Free.png?1373067048"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Unsene uses 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for messaging, which is a standard for many <strong>corporate and military grade communications. </strong>Plus, for our premium version, we’re utilizing even more powerful encryption known as xAES, which will be <strong>up to 4096-bit encryption.</strong></p>
<p><strong> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/912265/pictures/full/20130705143214-Military_Grade_Security.png?1373059941"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<div><em>The Platform</em></div>
<div> </div>
<p> <strong>We want to make Unsene a platform</strong>. Our dream is to e<em>mpower developers to build build amazing things</em> that right now can only be imagined, in communications, social media, payments and more.  We also want to make this a platform that people can use to make money, to make a living.</p>
<div> </div>
<div><em>The Unsene difference</em></div>
<div> </div>
<p>The cool thing about the desktop, and hopefully mobile versions, too is that not only are they encrypted like the web version, but they are also <strong>completely peer-to-peer</strong>(P2P), so the message goes from you to the person you’re talking to. <em>It’s only unencrypted on your computer and theirs</em>, and you get notification of delivery! That means <strong>there’s no fear of a message intercepted or blocked</strong>, <em>or a website getting shut down</em> or your email just disappearing.</p>
</div>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h1>We’re in This Together </h1>
<div>As you can imagine, something of this scope, security, and technical complexity consumes a lot of resources.  So far, <strong>we’re completely self-funded</strong>. Because of our track record and past success, <strong>we could have raised money from venture capital</strong>, but if we did, <em>then we might lose the autonomy</em> that is critical for a project like this, so we won’t go down that road.   If we took money from other sources, there are always strings attached, so <strong>freedom would be sacrificed</strong> for corporate or financial interest and so would your privacy.  We’ll never do that.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>So we’re turning to you, our community and future users, to <em>help support something that really can change the world</em>. We believe that the future of free speech and the internet in general and all over the world, <strong>depends on the ability for everyone to have free and open communications</strong>. Without that, people don't have an opportunity to learn what is true.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>The platform for Unsene will be <strong>built from the ground up to serve society and our community of users and developers come first</strong>. Our vision to provide an <strong>open development environment</strong> that becomes the backbone for any kind of secure communications or transactions that <em>visionaries like you</em> want to develop. We want people to be able express their creativity with complementary applications without having to compromise security.  And we’ll appreciate your support along the way, be it in form of development ideas or to bug reporting.  </p>
<div>We’re also have a very friendly <strong>affiliate program</strong> where developers and users get paid handsomely for bringing paid users into the Unsene ecosystem.  This way, it can pay you to help us, too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To pull this off, <strong>we need your help</strong>. We need your support, creatively, technically, morally, and financially. We want to hear what you want us to build, we’re honored to hear your ideas, we love elegant technical solutions, and we appreciate y<strong>our investment in something bigger than ourselves</strong>, <em>the future of privacy, freedom of speech, and an open Internet.</em>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>We’re doing this for all for us,</strong> for our friends, our families, our children, our community, and for the future.</div>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h1>The Time is Now</h1>
<p><strong>Never has there been a time in history when privacy around the world has been so critical and yet so compromised.</strong> Just turning on the news, we hear more and more about <em>the encroachment on our freedom</em>, be it <strong>internet censorship or the</strong> <strong>shutdown of the Internet</strong> in different parts of the world, or the right here in own backyards in the United States with <em>the NSA’s constant monitoring of our messages</em> by the government’s PRISM program with no oversight. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>If we don’t do something soon, it may be too late.</strong> Technology can either be a instrument for advancement or an instrument for restriction of liberties. We believe that we have a moral obligation to play our part to help preserve the freedoms that every person is entitled to.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We can try to make more laws, but that just restricts us even more. We can ask the corporations, but they care more about the bottom line than the privacy of their users.<strong>So sometimes we just need to do it ourselves. Do it together.</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<em>We need to take back our privacy</em>, to be able to talk with our friends, our family members, our clients, our doctors without someone snooping in or watching over our shoulder. <em>We don’t want 2014 to become George Orwell’s 1984.</em> <strong>The world certainly didn’t end in 2012, but our privacy has, if we don’t stand together and do something about it.</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<em>The more people that join us the larger the community we build</em> of free thinkers, good citizens, and thoughtful custodians of a world that has lost its moral compass. A world that needs a forum where people can say what’s on their mind without being monitored. A world where we can all just as easily and privately talk with friends around the world, as we do in person with our neighbors on our front porch or our children in our own home. </div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>The world is changing.</strong> <em>People desperately want to be able to speak their minds. To have a voice.</em> To blaze a path of their own choosing and to hear unfiltered news and information <strong>to learn the truth</strong>. We believe that to get there, <strong>we need privacy</strong>.<em> We need security. We need freedom</em>.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>The world needs a platform, a vision, to do that. <em>We call it Unsene.</em>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Join us.</strong></div>
<h1>Our Team</h1>
<p>Based in San Francisco, we have an international team of developers (20 in Asia) and marketing professionals, and we’re always looking for new talent to join. Here’s our background:</p>
<p><strong>Chris Kitze, CEO</strong></p>
<p><strong> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/912399/pictures/full/20130705162426-Chris_Kitze_-_Unsene.jpg?1373067063"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Chris founded and ran some of the Internet’s top properties. He was VP of Lycos at its IPO, founder of Xoom.com(the largest chat network and 13th most popular site on the web at the time of its IPO), the CEO of NBCi (7th most popular site on the web at the time), Yaga (an early P2P content delivery company), and Wine.com.</p>
<p><strong>Vinh Vo, CTO</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/912780/pictures/full/20130705215429-Vinh_Vo_-_LinkedIn.jpg?1373086474"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Vinh has worked in high tech at startups and large companies for over ten years. He was on the 4Home team when it was sold to Motorola, where he worked on residential automation technology. At Symantec, he worked on security products such as the HIDS (Host Intrusion Detection System) and IDS (Intrusion Detection System). He worked for 2wire Inc. on scaling large networks for the high volume traffic backend infrastructure for AT&amp;T DSL network services.</p>
<p><strong>Simon Thomas, Director of Product and Marketing</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/912781/pictures/full/20130705215442-Simon_Thomas_-_LinkedIn_-_big.jpg?1373086485"" src="""" style=""""/> </strong></p>
<p>Simon has run marketing, CRM, and/or product for large companies such as United Way of America (the largest non-profit salesforce CRM implentation), startups like AskSunday (a Time magazine top ten website of the year) and internet marketing wunderkinds such as StomperNet (largest launch in Internet history: $18.3 million dollars in orders in 24 hours).</p>
<div>
<h1>Our Technology</h1>
<p>Our truly secure communications platform is a big feat and there are many components we’ll need to develop to create a truly end-to-end secure system for message and content delivery.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<em>Features</em>: </div>
<div>·      <strong>Advanced cryptography algorithms</strong>: Includes xAES (which was in the running for the AES standard and has much higher bit rates) and we are developing a flexible One Time Pad system, which is nearly immune to cryptanalysis.</div>
<div>·      <strong>No Plugins</strong>: No additional plugin installation on the browser to provide End-To-End Security for the web based system.</div>
<div>·      <em>Secure key exchange</em>: Innovative and secure Key exchange protocol.</div>
<div>·      <em>XMPP</em>: Industry standard XMMP for message communication.</div>
<div>·      <em>Peer-to-Peer</em>: P2P Video/Audio/File Sharing on across all platforms (Web Browser, Desktop, and Mobile). WebRTC, a new standard.</div>
<div>·      <strong>Anonymity</strong>: Using crowd-distributed P2P network.</div>
<div>·      <strong>Private</strong>: Use private P2P network.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/912712/pictures/full/20130705205037-Unsene_Software_Stack_Pasted_Image_6_28_13_6_14_PM.jpeg?1373082640"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div>
<p>Application Layers</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PubSub</strong> - XMPP PubSub is a protocol extension for generic publish-subscribe functionality. PubSub allows us to create each End or Client as a Node of the entire network.</li>
<li>
<strong>XMPP</strong> is one of the standard streaming XML protocol for exchanging messages.</li>
<li>
<strong>Encryption</strong> consists of multiple layers.<br/>a. <strong>SSL and TLS</strong> for Tunnel Security Layer.<br/>b. <strong>RSA-2048</strong> bits for Exchange Private information among the peers<br/>c. <strong>AES-256bits</strong> and xAES-4048bits for Chat and File Sharing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Flexible One Time Pad System</strong> with Advanced Random Function.</li>
<li>
<strong>Signaling Process</strong> allows each node to establish P2P connection.</li>
<li>
<strong>WebRTC</strong> for P2P direct communications</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/912714/pictures/full/20130705205047-Unsene_Overlay_Network_Technology_Pasted_Image_6_28_13_6_15_PM.jpeg?1373082649"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Unsene Service Cluster</strong> – Bootstrap servers, Signaling Servers, Supernode Servers, Storage Servers, Relay Servers, and Web Servers. This is a fallback mechanism for the P2P network and it will enhance the performance.  If any routing node or path is incomplete due to firewall or other form of blockage, this fallback service will help maintain a node’s connection. </p>
<div>
<p><strong>Relay/Routing Node</strong> – With your permission, this extension to the Unsene Client allows other friends you are connected with to use your computer to relay their communications to other nodes.  This creates the shared Unsene P2P Network. A relay node acts as a virtual router for different nodes. It is also a dynamic supernode on the private P2P Network.  This capability of relay/routing node will create a Distributed P2P Network and creates redundancy if the Unsene super-nodes are unavailable. </p>
<p><strong>Regular Node</strong> – This is the Unsene client on Desktop, Web Browser, and Mobile Device. It will provide Instant Chat, Media, and File Sharing. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3 class=""dotty"">Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>There are two main risk factors to this project, beside the usual difficulties of developing software for the first time with a virtual team who are in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>1. Scaling. Communications services that work and provide significant value that are freely available are extremely viral. The existence of many other social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn and others are leveraged in the service to rapidly make connections. Sending messages to non-Unsene users encourages others to join and use this kind of service.</p>
<p>To deal with this problem, we will be installing our first cluster during July. This will provide redundancy in the event of a single computer failure and usually allow updating of the site and service without interruption to the user. In the future, if our growth warrants, we will have multiple data centers in different locations.</p>
<p>Another way to make scaling more effective is to drive more usage of the peer to peer nature of the network. This pushes the hardware and bandwidth consumption to the place where it can most efficiently be used; the edge of the network (your computer).</p>
<p>2. Security. Because we're running a site that makes security claims, Unsene is a target for hacking. Our experience is that quite a bit of this is friendly hacking and we definitely want to hear if you've discovered any weaknesses in the system so we can rectify them before anyone suffers losses.</p>
<p>For the unfriendly hacking, the best we can do is to use state of the art techniques to defeat these attacks. We start with our security model. We won't store any keys or passwords on our site; they will all be retained by the user. This has the advantage of not having a centralized place for someone to gain access to everyone's keys and account info. It also has the advantage of protecting our users from unreasonable search and seizure. Any messages stored on our server are encrypted (in the event the user has chosen that approach for convenience) and the key needed to decrypt them is retained by the user only. There will be many other security features implemented in our software, hardware and network design.</p>
<p>Help us build the future of security and privacy by making a pledge now</p>

Q&A

How will this help me?Unlike email, text messages, and Facebook messages, which are sent in the clear and can be easily hacked, we use military grade encryption to protect your messages from hackers. And we protect your privacy. We don't hand over information to the NSA like many big Internet companies do.
What is the advantage of this over Skype?We will be offering a higher level of encryption and security and we don't keep your key (to unocking your data), you do. We don't participate in the NSA's PRISM program. We don't eat up your computer and Internet bandwith. We have a web-based version, which is super convenient. 
What is the advantage over Facebook messages?All messages on Facebook are sent in the clear so anyone can intercept them. Facebook keeps all your messages. On Unsene all your messages are encrypted with military grade encyrption and we will be offering an even higher level of encryption and security. We don't keep your key (to unocking your data), you do. We don't participate in the NSA's PRISM program.
What is the advantage of this over Tor?Tor is for anonymous Internet browsing. Unsene isn't for browsing the Internet or anonymizing. This is for securely communicating with others and creating your own secure, private networks.
Do you keep log files of calls?  No. We don't keep log files on calls. The history is purged within 7 days.
Do you keep an archive of my messages?No. Everything is purged in 7 days. In the premium version, you can store them longer if you want to.

How do I know I can trust you?Check us out under our team at end of the description. You can talk to people who have done business with us and they will tell you our track record.
Will you share my info with anyone and how do I know you won't?No, we won't share it. Privacy is at the heart of our business. You can read our privacy policy and terms of service. Also, we don't keep your keys, so we couldn't access your messages even if we wanted to.
Does this have secure email?
Currently, it does not have a regular email address, but there will be an email gateway in the not too distant future. Email is incredibly insecure, which mean it's not only read, but it's blocked and can even be altered in mid stream and you don't know it. We've got a Secure Email area in the web site that allows you to send an encrypted message to someone who has email, but doesn't have unsene yet. It's an email with a link to a page on our site with the encrypted message, which is revealed once they enter the correct password. The future email gateway will allow peopleto send and receive and respond to these secure emails and you'll evenhave your own unsene email account if you'd like. We're still workingout those details, but that's the direction we're headed.
Is there a way to send messages to several people in a group?Yes, we have group functions. You can text message to a group and sharefiles with groups. We're hoping to have publish / subscribe workingthis week. That'll mean you can replace your listserve emails withUnsene. No more ""spam filters"" by ISP's or others...
Can it be used for group skype-type calls?Not yet, but we're working on this as we speak. Today, we have one toone Skype type audio calls. I think we'll have something this week ornext. We've also got video calls in the works, which work for one toone today and we hope to have them working for groups shortly after wehave the audio group calls.
Is file-sharing like an email attachment? (obviously i have never used any file-sharing program)It works a lot like Skype, but it's also like email, because it uses ourcentral server to store and forward your file. You just choose theperson you want to send it to from your contacts and click ""Share"", thenchoose the file you want to send. The file is encrypted, then sent toour server and picked up by your recipient anywhere from immediately(it's real time) or whenever they come back online. We'll even sendthem an email to remind them they have a file waiting to be picked up. There's a 100MB limit we've artificially imposed, but we expect to getthat raised quite a bit, once we also have peer to peer. In the nearfuture, with publish / subscribe, you'll be able to put a file to agroup and anyone in the group will have access to it. Fully encryptedof course.
What's the developer version for?The $97 level is for developers, that would be someone who wants to eventually develop applications using an API.

What Unsene can't do.
 
That being said, here's what Unsene can't do:


It can't make your insecure emails secure. Email is inherently insecure because it travels through many servers. Also, even if you were to encrypt your email, the headers such as to, from, and subject line would still be sent in the clear. In contrast, Unsene was designed from the ground up as an end-to-end encrypted and secure service that can deliver messages in real time.

It can't protect you if you are breaking the law: If we are notified by authorities that you are using Unsene to a commit criminal act, then your account could be terminated.
 
 
How It Works

 


Military-grade security protects your important private messages, photos and videos, everywhere. It's so strong that we can't export it to Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and North Korea.


Unlimited messages to anyone, even if they’re aren't on Unsene yet.

Nothing to Install (unless you want to)
 

It will be virtually unblockable on the peer-to-peer desktop version.

 
Contribute now to secure your privacy and freedom!
 
Encryption, Security, and Privacy
 

Takes your message and mixes it up, that is, encrypts it, so no one else can read it.
Use the same level of encryption that the military uses for top secret information

Encrypts each individual message separately.

Only you have the key; we don't keep it.

Why Unsene Is A Necessity Now
“Free speech is the whole thing, the whole ball game. Free speech is life itself.” —Salman Rushdie, author
Over the years, people’s personal rights, privacy, and freedom have slowly been eroding. And now, with the recent revelations about the NSA, more than ever, personal privacy and security are at the forefront of people’s minds here in the U.S.
Plus, in places around the world, where people’s lives depend ability to communicate on the Internet, where it could finally secure freedom, the government has tried to shut down social media and search engines.
 
Have you ever wondered what would happen if suddenly people everywhere in the world could communicate securely without being monitored and get uncensored information?
 
Well, a few of us did and we thought it might lead to the fastest expansion of freedom of speech and human rights the world has ever seen! A world where people would no longer have to live in fear.

So we decided to do something about it...
Introducing Unsene:
It’s an encrypted, web-based, desktop, and mobile service for messaging, voice and video calls, and file sharing!
 

Secure, web-based chat with all the functionality of a desktop client, yet nothing to install. 
 
There's no back door. You keep the keys; we don't. Everything is securely encrypted, so you retain your privacy. 
Here are the state of the art features and benefits of Unsene that protect your privacy:


Secure: Military-grade security protects your important and private messages, photos and videos. Uses 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for messaging, which is a standard for military grade communications. And if you want stronger encryption, you can buy our premium version which will include xAES, with up to 4096-bit encryption, which goes far beyond AES 256-bit. You can even see the encrypted version of the text!




Works everywhere: Web-based, desktop, and mobile. Use anywhere you have access to the Internet: on your computer, a friend’s or in Internet café. We already have the web version in pre-beta. Mac, Windows, and Linux desktop versions as well as Android and iPhone versions are in the works.
 


Unlimited: Unlimited message to anyone, even if they aren't on Unsene yet (includes most features). No mailbox size caps and no  advertising. And with the premium version you can keep the messages for as long as your premium is active.
 


Easy: Works just like web mail. Nothing to install unless you want to, so you can just login and start using it.
 


Unlimited sharing: Unlimited photo and file sharing. Yes, that’s right, send as many photos and files as you want.



Developer environment: In the near future, will have open platform for developing new secure applications and adding security to your existing ones.
 


Affiliate program: Earn a living or grow your existing business by helping people protect their privacy. Imagine if when you invite people to Unsene and they had upgrade to premium, you actually had gotten a cut of that instead keeping it all to themselves.
 


Content delivery: There will also be an edition where people will be able to subscribe to your feed like an email list or microblogging service and you can build a subscriber base. So you could use it instead of your existing email list, where the delivery rate is low. With Unsene, you’ll get way better delivery rate compared to email, because it can't be being blocked by ISPs or spam filters like email can.

 


And more coming soon: Mission: Impossible-style self-destructing messages, so your messages won’t be copied or archived after they are read.

Our Story
When the Internet first began, everyone was excited about the possibilities it opened to connect with others, be it friends, family, or like minded people around the world. When we got our first internet account and joined the worldwide community of people, we could share interests, ideas and chat with people thousands of miles away. The Internet was a place of exploration, of free expression, of discovery. A place before words like Internet freedom, Internet censorship, Internet privacy existed, because they didn’t need to.
 
Slowly over time, as bigger corporations and bigger government took hold of things, the excitement, the freedom, and the privacy of Internet began to erode.People felt betrayed. Until the world got to the point where we are today, where webegan to feel imprisoned by the very thing that used to give us a sense of freedom.
 
Frustrated with the spying on or hacking into our text messages, emails, and calls, our team at Unsene wanted a way where we could communicate freely, where what you said or wrote was only sent to the person you addressed it to. Where you don't have to worry about being censored -- because if someone in the middle could read your message, they could also block it.  Where you could say what you wanted, when you wanted, where you wanted, without any repercussions. Where you had privacy. Where you had security.  Where you had freedom.
 
That’s not the reality of life on the Internet today. Instead, it seems that everything we use and trust has serious privacy issues, be it texting on our cell phone,using webmail, sending messages on social media, or chatting on instant messaging services. If it isn’t Russian hackers, it’s the companies themselves, business competitors, even the NSA and governments.
 
Even worse, in some countries, social media and major Internet services are completely blocked. It isn’t just the Internet that is shut down, but freedom of speech is squelched altogether.
 
Our team looked, but we couldn’t find any consumer-friendly secure chat, messaging, voice, and photo sharing app. And there certainly wasn’t a mainstream messaging app with good security.
 
 
 
Things that were supposed to be secure ended up not being so. Many companies have been forced to turn over information to the government. Many articles spoke about certain internet chat and voice calling servicespossibly having a backdoor in the U.S. just as it did already in China. Then, the news hit of the big technology’s company's participation in NSA’s surveillance program and it became clear that humungous amounts of communications were being turned over to the  NSA.

The secure options that did exist were way too expensive, built for corporations, and large institutions where money was no object. That’s not what people wanted. How could you ever convince our friends and family that the only way to talk to us was to pony up for some high-priced service?
 
On the other hand, the low cost options were way too complicated. Some services took hours to set up, and still it never worked correctly, before it got shelved when it was acquired by a big company. The rest were like tech toys, not made for regular people.
 
There needed to be something secure where we you could just login to to the websitewithout having to install anything, like webmail and online social media services.Something that was so simple that even our parents or grandparents could use it without an instruction manual.
 
Our team dreamed of something that was as easy to use as Skype, Facebook, or Viber, was super secure using top secret level encryption, had a low cost version, and also a pro version for people who needed extra security, and worked on every platform, even the web. It would be a simple, secure and private communications platform and community. And what we wanted just didn’t exist.
 

Having built some of the Earth’s most trafficked websites (e.g., top 10 in the world) and ran mission critical communications (e.g., Motorola, AT&T), our team felt that we were the ones that had to do it. That we had to make the dreams a reality.
 
 
The Product
 
So our team began building. It’s taken us 2 years and we are proud to say that we have built the first encrypted, web-based service for messaging, voice and video calls, and file sharing!

 


Unsene uses 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for messaging, which is a standard for many corporate and military grade communications. Plus, for our premium version, we’re utilizing even more powerful encryption known as xAES, which will be up to 4096-bit encryption.
 
 
 
 We have big plans. Mac, Windows, and Linux desktop versions as well as Android and iPhone versions are in the works. 
 


 

The Platform
 
 We want to make Unsene a platform. Our dream is to empower developers to build build amazing things that right now can only be imagined, in communications, social media, payments and more.  We also want to make this a platform that people can use to make money, to make a living.
 
The Unsene difference
 
The cool thing about the desktop, and hopefully mobile versions, too is that not only are they encrypted like the web version, but they are also completely peer-to-peer(P2P), so the message goes from you to the person you’re talking to. It’s only unencrypted on your computer and theirs, and you get notification of delivery! That means there’s no fear of a message intercepted or blocked, or a website getting shut down or your email just disappearing.

 
We’re in This Together 
As you can imagine, something of this scope, security, and technical complexity consumes a lot of resources.  So far, we’re completely self-funded. Because of our track record and past success, we could have raised money from venture capital, but if we did, then we might lose the autonomy that is critical for a project like this, so we won’t go down that road.   If we took money from other sources, there are always strings attached, so freedom would be sacrificed for corporate or financial interest and so would your privacy.  We’ll never do that.
 
So we’re turning to you, our community and future users, to help support something that really can change the world. We believe that the future of free speech and the internet in general and all over the world, depends on the ability for everyone to have free and open communications. Without that, people don't have an opportunity to learn what is true.
 
The platform for Unsene will be built from the ground up to serve society and our community of users and developers come first. Our vision to provide an open development environment that becomes the backbone for any kind of secure communications or transactions that visionaries like you want to develop. We want people to be able express their creativity with complementary applications without having to compromise security.  And we’ll appreciate your support along the way, be it in form of development ideas or to bug reporting.  
We’re also have a very friendly affiliate program where developers and users get paid handsomely for bringing paid users into the Unsene ecosystem.  This way, it can pay you to help us, too.
 
To pull this off, we need your help. We need your support, creatively, technically, morally, and financially. We want to hear what you want us to build, we’re honored to hear your ideas, we love elegant technical solutions, and we appreciate your investment in something bigger than ourselves, the future of privacy, freedom of speech, and an open Internet.

 

We’re doing this for all for us, for our friends, our families, our children, our community, and for the future.
 
 
The Time is Now
Never has there been a time in history when privacy around the world has been so critical and yet so compromised. Just turning on the news, we hear more and more about the encroachment on our freedom, be it internet censorship or the shutdown of the Internet in different parts of the world, or the right here in own backyards in the United States with the NSA’s constant monitoring of our messages by the government’s PRISM program with no oversight. 
 

If we don’t do something soon, it may be too late. Technology can either be a instrument for advancement or an instrument for restriction of liberties. We believe that we have a moral obligation to play our part to help preserve the freedoms that every person is entitled to.
 
We can try to make more laws, but that just restricts us even more. We can ask the corporations, but they care more about the bottom line than the privacy of their users.So sometimes we just need to do it ourselves. Do it together.

 

We need to take back our privacy, to be able to talk with our friends, our family members, our clients, our doctors without someone snooping in or watching over our shoulder. We don’t want 2014 to become George Orwell’s 1984. The world certainly didn’t end in 2012, but our privacy has, if we don’t stand together and do something about it.

 

The more people that join us the larger the community we build of free thinkers, good citizens, and thoughtful custodians of a world that has lost its moral compass. A world that needs a forum where people can say what’s on their mind without being monitored. A world where we can all just as easily and privately talk with friends around the world, as we do in person with our neighbors on our front porch or our children in our own home. 
 
The world is changing. People desperately want to be able to speak their minds. To have a voice. To blaze a path of their own choosing and to hear unfiltered news and information to learn the truth. We believe that to get there, we need privacy. We need security. We need freedom.
 
The world needs a platform, a vision, to do that. We call it Unsene.

 
Join us.
Our Team
Based in San Francisco, we have an international team of developers (20 in Asia) and marketing professionals, and we’re always looking for new talent to join. Here’s our background:
Chris Kitze, CEO
 
Chris founded and ran some of the Internet’s top properties. He was VP of Lycos at its IPO, founder of Xoom.com(the largest chat network and 13th most popular site on the web at the time of its IPO), the CEO of NBCi (7th most popular site on the web at the time), Yaga (an early P2P content delivery company), and Wine.com.
Vinh Vo, CTO

Vinh has worked in high tech at startups and large companies for over ten years. He was on the 4Home team when it was sold to Motorola, where he worked on residential automation technology. At Symantec, he worked on security products such as the HIDS (Host Intrusion Detection System) and IDS (Intrusion Detection System). He worked for 2wire Inc. on scaling large networks for the high volume traffic backend infrastructure for AT&T DSL network services.
Simon Thomas, Director of Product and Marketing
 
Simon has run marketing, CRM, and/or product for large companies such as United Way of America (the largest non-profit salesforce CRM implentation), startups like AskSunday (a Time magazine top ten website of the year) and internet marketing wunderkinds such as StomperNet (largest launch in Internet history: $18.3 million dollars in orders in 24 hours).

Our Technology
Our truly secure communications platform is a big feat and there are many components we’ll need to develop to create a truly end-to-end secure system for message and content delivery.
 

Features: 
·      Advanced cryptography algorithms: Includes xAES (which was in the running for the AES standard and has much higher bit rates) and we are developing a flexible One Time Pad system, which is nearly immune to cryptanalysis.
·      No Plugins: No additional plugin installation on the browser to provide End-To-End Security for the web based system.
·      Secure key exchange: Innovative and secure Key exchange protocol.
·      XMPP: Industry standard XMMP for message communication.
·      Peer-to-Peer: P2P Video/Audio/File Sharing on across all platforms (Web Browser, Desktop, and Mobile). WebRTC, a new standard.
·      Anonymity: Using crowd-distributed P2P network.
·      Private: Use private P2P network.
 


Application Layers



PubSub - XMPP PubSub is a protocol extension for generic publish-subscribe functionality. PubSub allows us to create each End or Client as a Node of the entire network.

XMPP is one of the standard streaming XML protocol for exchanging messages.

Encryption consists of multiple layers.a. SSL and TLS for Tunnel Security Layer.b. RSA-2048 bits for Exchange Private information among the peersc. AES-256bits and xAES-4048bits for Chat and File Sharing.

Flexible One Time Pad System with Advanced Random Function.

Signaling Process allows each node to establish P2P connection.

WebRTC for P2P direct communications


Unsene Service Cluster – Bootstrap servers, Signaling Servers, Supernode Servers, Storage Servers, Relay Servers, and Web Servers. This is a fallback mechanism for the P2P network and it will enhance the performance.  If any routing node or path is incomplete due to firewall or other form of blockage, this fallback service will help maintain a node’s connection. 

Relay/Routing Node – With your permission, this extension to the Unsene Client allows other friends you are connected with to use your computer to relay their communications to other nodes.  This creates the shared Unsene P2P Network. A relay node acts as a virtual router for different nodes. It is also a dynamic supernode on the private P2P Network.  This capability of relay/routing node will create a Distributed P2P Network and creates redundancy if the Unsene super-nodes are unavailable. 
Regular Node – This is the Unsene client on Desktop, Web Browser, and Mobile Device. It will provide Instant Chat, Media, and File Sharing.

Risks and challenges
There are two main risk factors to this project, beside the usual difficulties of developing software for the first time with a virtual team who are in different parts of the world.
1. Scaling. Communications services that work and provide significant value that are freely available are extremely viral. The existence of many other social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn and others are leveraged in the service to rapidly make connections. Sending messages to non-Unsene users encourages others to join and use this kind of service.
To deal with this problem, we will be installing our first cluster during July. This will provide redundancy in the event of a single computer failure and usually allow updating of the site and service without interruption to the user. In the future, if our growth warrants, we will have multiple data centers in different locations.
Another way to make scaling more effective is to drive more usage of the peer to peer nature of the network. This pushes the hardware and bandwidth consumption to the place where it can most efficiently be used; the edge of the network (your computer).
2. Security. Because we're running a site that makes security claims, Unsene is a target for hacking. Our experience is that quite a bit of this is friendly hacking and we definitely want to hear if you've discovered any weaknesses in the system so we can rectify them before anyone suffers losses.
For the unfriendly hacking, the best we can do is to use state of the art techniques to defeat these attacks. We start with our security model. We won't store any keys or passwords on our site; they will all be retained by the user. This has the advantage of not having a centralized place for someone to gain access to everyone's keys and account info. It also has the advantage of protecting our users from unreasonable search and seizure. Any messages stored on our server are encrypted (in the event the user has chosen that approach for convenience) and the key needed to decrypt them is retained by the user only. There will be many other security features implemented in our software, hardware and network design.

Risks & Challenges

 The implementation and effective working of this project involves hurdles which need constant effort to overcome.

Most of the Visually Impaired Children across India belong to families that are facing economic hardships and instability.These Children have no funds to purchase modern gadgets like the smartphone which can then be used to learn the basics of technology.A challenge that we are facing is how to generate sufficient funds to get modern technology to all the Institutions for the visually disabled across India.
We want to do this by getting the Android One phones into the hands of these young visually challenged.
India is a country which has 780 recognised languages! Visually Impaired Children across the country make use of their regional language for studying and conversing in daily life.One of the challenges that this project will face is how to reach out to all these children and help them learn the working of modern technology in their respective languages.

And most important of all have it be self-contained so you dont have to carry around extra cables. So we looked for the thinnest battery on the market to put the maximum power possible into our <i>""Charged-Card"".

<h1>Introducing the ReadyBright™ Lantern!</h1>
<p>A very bright LED Lantern that turns on automatically when the power goes out and also charges your electronics.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make power outages safer for your family.  The ReadyBright Power Outage Activated Lantern with a USB charger is an extension of the ReadyBright Home Power Outage Lighting System from Mr. Beams.  The project funding will go towards tooling, pilot production and packaging design.  The ReadyBright Power Outage Activated Lantern will be available by November 20, 2012.  </p>
<p><strong><em><span>Another goal is to promote emergency preparedness. We will be donating 15% of of the total we raise to our local American Red Cross Cleveland Chapter.  Our donation will help support Emergency Service volunteers, who respond to an average of one fire emergency every day in our hometown.  </span></em></strong></p>
<div class=""im"">
<p><strong><em><span>If we meet our funding goal, our donation will reach $3,000!</span></em></strong></p>
</div>
<p><em><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mrbeams.com/images/zpd8086-3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p>The ReadyBright Power Outage Activated Lantern has been designed so you can safely move about your house during a power outage and charge your smartphone, iPad or MP3 player without electricity in about 4 hours.  You will always feel connected.  The very bright LED light, which works with the POD (Power Outage Detector), will turn on instantly during a power failure and provide more than 300 lumens and over 25 hours of bright light to get you through any power outage.  The Cree LED array provides plenty of light for navigating a dark house safely; reading; playing games; preparing food and brushing your teeth.  The Cree LED light source provides a high lumen output and an industry leading efficiency in converting battery power to light.  A low mode provides a great night light.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mrbeams.com/images/zpd8086-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p>The ReadyBright Power Outage Activated Lantern will turn on automatically when the power goes out or turn on and off manually.  Unbreakable LED's are used to provide more than 25 hours of light on one set of 4 D batteries.  In case of an extended power outage, just change the batteries.</p>
<div>
<p>The ReadyBright Power Outage Activated Lantern is a sleek design so it will look great in your house, yet rugged enough to take on any camping trip.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing the ReadyBright™ Lantern!
A very bright LED Lantern that turns on automatically when the power goes out and also charges your electronics.
Our goal is to make power outages safer for your family.  The ReadyBright Power Outage Activated Lantern with a USB charger is an extension of the ReadyBright Home Power Outage Lighting System from Mr. Beams.  The project funding will go towards tooling, pilot production and packaging design.  The ReadyBright Power Outage Activated Lantern will be available by November 20, 2012.  
Another goal is to promote emergency preparedness. We will be donating 15% of of the total we raise to our local American Red Cross Cleveland Chapter.  Our donation will help support Emergency Service volunteers, who respond to an average of one fire emergency every day in our hometown.  

If we meet our funding goal, our donation will reach $3,000!


 
The ReadyBright Power Outage Activated Lantern has been designed so you can safely move about your house during a power outage and charge your smartphone, iPad or MP3 player without electricity in about 4 hours.  You will always feel connected.  The very bright LED light, which works with the POD (Power Outage Detector), will turn on instantly during a power failure and provide more than 300 lumens and over 25 hours of bright light to get you through any power outage.  The Cree LED array provides plenty of light for navigating a dark house safely; reading; playing games; preparing food and brushing your teeth.  The Cree LED light source provides a high lumen output and an industry leading efficiency in converting battery power to light.  A low mode provides a great night light.
 

 
The ReadyBright Power Outage Activated Lantern will turn on automatically when the power goes out or turn on and off manually.  Unbreakable LED's are used to provide more than 25 hours of light on one set of 4 D batteries.  In case of an extended power outage, just change the batteries.

The ReadyBright Power Outage Activated Lantern is a sleek design so it will look great in your house, yet rugged enough to take on any camping trip.

During a game, controller issues such as lag can be really frustrating. BiggiFi has been designed to keep the latency between the BiggiFi device and the controllers to an absolute minimum to ensure responsiveness.<p>There are several technologies that allow phones to use TVs as displays such as AirPlay Mirroring and Miracast. These technologies work by transmitting the screen encoding package of phone to the TV. On the TV end, it needs to receiving and decoding the screen encoding package. This causes lag between the phone and the display and also requires more power from the phone. <b>BiggiFi isn't another screen mirroring technology.</b> With BiggiFi, the phone just passes its control inputs and outputs to and from the BiggiFi device. The BiggiFi device hosts and runs your content. This reduces BiggiFi's phone-to-TV latency and provides a significant advantage over existing products, especially when dealing with time-sensitive activities such as gaming.<br/></p>

<p><br/>It has been an amazing journey to work on a project that leads to a revolutionary product – BiggiFi. We are looking forward to having you be part of BiggiFi. Be part of this revolution!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1><b>Development History</b></h1>
<p>The idea for BiggiFi began from earlier projects of ours. We were working on an app that transcodes videos so that they can be played on a mobile device. The mobile screen, however, was too small to play the videos with the proper quality. We were also working on another project involving Android and the TI DM3730. This device supported 1080P output and could be connected to a TV via HDMI. The display quality from this device was vastly superior to that of mobile screens.</p>
<p>Running mobile applications on the DM3730 was simple enough but there was no way to properly interact with the apps. All mobile apps are developed based on mobile device inputs, such as touch screens, accelerometers, etc. The DM3730 doesn’t have any of these. To correct this, we decided to add mobile controls to the DM3730.</p>
<p>It is from this that in 2011, BiggiFi was born!</p>
<p>We quickly shifted our focus to BiggiFi's development.</p>
<p>Three months later, the first prototype came out. Along with the necessary modifications made to the Android framework, we developed a server running on the DM3730 to receive control data, like user touch data from a smartphone, and feed it to those apps running on the DM3730. An app running on an Android smartphone collected touch screen data and transferred it to the server. When a user touches a position on their smartphone, this action is sent to the DM3730. We added a screenshot function to help orientate the user.</p>
<p>To assist the user with more precise actions, we also added a “mouse mode” which allows a smartphone to act as a trackpad. Both mode were very useful, so in the first prototype, we put two in the same screen, one in half screen. There were many games controlled by accelerometer as well, like racing games. So we supported sensor data transfer in the second version.</p>
<p>As we continued to develop BiggiFi and the BiggiFi app, we gained more and more control functions. Meantime we were also worked on compatibility with a select couple of games and apps</p>
<p>After one year of development, BiggiFi supported most Android apps. The next was to create a consumer product.</p>We found a company in Shenzen that makes an HDMI device suited for BiggiFi. For the past year, we have been working closely with them to customize and optimize the device to meet the product specification of BiggiFi. We first need to modify the firmware and customize the Android to make it compatible with BiggiFi app. The WiFi performance is extremely important so we spent a lot of time to optimize the WiFi module that resulted in a second hardware spin. Initially, there are two PCB boards, in order to further reduce the cost, we combined two PCB boards into single PCB board. This is the third spin of the hardware. During this time, we have continued to optimize the software to improve user experience and easy of use. We also developed a functional prototype app for iOS.<br/><br/><h1>Why Indiegogo?</h1>

There are some final software issues, such as performance issues and a redesign of the user interface to work out but other than that BiggiFi is complete and ready to ship. We have already secured a manufacturer (in China) who is willing to help us produce BiggiFi at an affordable price. We need your help to fund the first batche of the BiggiFi device as well as helping us with product fulfillment. We also need funds for FCC certification.<p>Our beta stage BiggiFi app for iOS still requires extensive testing for any bugs or stability issues that need to be addressed We are also working to improve the auto-setup process. We hope additional resources will help facilitate this process.</p>
<p>Everyone's involvement with BiggiFi matters. You can help us to realize the dream to bring millions of apps right to your TV. By getting one of the first BiggiFi devices, you can help fund our enterprise and you can enjoy your favorite apps on TV right now!</p>

BiggiFi: The smartphone interface technology for your TV.
  BiggiFi makes mobile apps Bigger! BiggiFi brings the excitement of the mobile world to the big screen. Enjoy apps on your TV using your smartphone.

The mobile world is exploding with developers big and small constantly bringing out hot new games and apps for the mobile platform. However, even with tablets, screen size is limited which impacts content quality.The television has a large screen capable of delivering awesome visuals, but content on television is limited to movies and shows. The smartphone has overtaken the TV in many cases as the entertainment device of choice. Bridging the gap between them has been an elusive goal.
BiggiFi fills this gap. BiggiFi transforms your television into a window into your mobile world while keeping your smartphone as the interface.

Enjoy tons of apps without porting or specialized remotes.
Show off in your favorite mobile games.
Look up restaurants, select movies, shop online together.
Watch online videos with friends and family.
And much more … all on the big screen.

With BiggiFi, you can enjoy millions of apps on your TV, instantly.

We give your TV a touchscreen interface
BiggiFi is the first technology that retains the touch-based smartphone interaction that apps are built around while delivering your apps to the big screen. You can give your television the magic “touch” from your smartphone! Unlike other devices, BiggiFi fully utilizes your smartphone as a controller, allowing you to use your smartphone to touch, pinch, slide, scroll, and tilt to interface with the TV in real-time. By doing so, BiggiFi lets you stay on the same interface you are used and eliminates the need for major porting. With BiggiFi, there is no need to purchase, learn, and use a specialized controller.BiggiFi your smartphone


Smart mobile devices are small. That's how they remain ""mobile"". This, however, limits the quality of content such as games and movies. With BiggiFi, the apps and media we love can be enjoyed in brilliant high-definition on our home television sets. By bringing smart devices to the large screens of televisions, BiggiFi also introduces a new in-person social element to the mobile platform. With Android on TV, families and friends can gather in the living room and enjoy movies, games, and apps together, live.
Extremely responsive

Gaming is important to us. During a game, controller issues such as lag can be really frustrating. BiggiFi has been designed to keep the latency between the BiggiFi device and the controllers to an absolute minimum to ensure responsiveness.There are several technologies that allow phones to use TVs as displays such as AirPlay Mirroring and Miracast. These technologies work by transmitting the screen encoding package of phone to the TV. On the TV end, it needs to receiving and decoding the screen encoding package. This causes lag between the phone and the display and also requires more power from the phone. BiggiFi isn't another screen mirroring technology. With BiggiFi, the phone just passes its control inputs and outputs to and from the BiggiFi device. The BiggiFi device hosts and runs your content. This reduces BiggiFi's phone-to-TV latency and provides a significant advantage over existing products, especially when dealing with time-sensitive activities such as gaming.
When you play gamess like Temple Run or Angry Birds on BiggiFi, there will be no delay. This way, high quality games can stay fast and sharp.Your life, your choiceYou often like to sit on the couch and play with your smartphone while TV is off. With BiggiFi, you can sit on the couch and play with your smartphone while TV is on with your favorite games and apps running on it. You can chose and experiment with tons of games and apps. You are part of the revolution to bring the excitement of smartphone to the TV.BiggiFi is packaged with an exclusive and new multi-user SDK that opens new possibilities for games and apps. The SDK was designed to implement one of the core ideas of BiggiFi: ""To expand the in-person social aspect of the mobile experience"". Where many current Android apps are designed for a single user experience, our SDK allows apps to receive multiple inputs from multiple smartphones to allow for activities such as the multi-player split-screen gaming commonly found in game consoles.We make mobile to TV transition seamless for developers
Those of you who are mobile game and app developer might wonder: ""Will my games and apps run on BiggiFi?"". Give it a try! Without changing a single line of code, your games or apps should run great. If not, don't panic! BiggiFi comes with a software development kit (SDK) to help you make your apps work (better) with BiggiFi.Never-before-seen console-like multi-player support
For existing Android applications, only one set of inputs/outputs are used. For example, there is one accelerometer and one vibrator. In the multi-user SDK, we created multiple sets of these assets with one for each mobile device running BiggiFi app. This allows each user controls their individual objects running on BiggiFi device. The communication between the BiggiFi device and the BiggiFi app remains the same. For example, in the split screen gaming, each mobile device can control its own character on the screen via its own accelerometer. And likewise, it can send separate vibration (rumble) to each mobile device running the BiggiFi app.We hope that in the hands of other creative minds, the BiggiFi SDK will produce millions of new and exciting ""in-person"" social apps.

How does it compare with Chromecast or other Android dongles?
BiggiFi and Chromecast are quite different! Chromecast is a special purpose device designed primarily to stream internet video content to the TV. Currently it only officially supports a few apps. BiggiFi is a multi-function smart device just like your smartphone and tablet, but with a much bigger display. Android TV dongles/MiniPCs and similar devices exist on the market but many of these devices use physical remote control or mobile applications simulating remote controls. This limits the number of apps and the experience of using these apps. We are the first to bring not only the Android operating environment but also the smartphone interface to the TV. With BiggiFi, anything is possible. You can install new applications, play games, and still, watch videos.
Interact with BiggiFi just as you would with your smartphone!
What can BiggiFi do for you?


Play games on TV through your phone like you’ve never seen before.
Stream and watch videos in high-definition and in high speed.
Do presentations on any HD TV when you are traveling.
Browse the internet and social network on the big screen.
Read newspaper via services like Pulse and Flipboard.
Endless possibilities...


Our mission with BiggiFi is to make your TV more fun: Share, play, learn, and connect.

It has been an amazing journey to work on a project that leads to a revolutionary product – BiggiFi. We are looking forward to having you be part of BiggiFi. Be part of this revolution!

Development History
The idea for BiggiFi began from earlier projects of ours. We were working on an app that transcodes videos so that they can be played on a mobile device. The mobile screen, however, was too small to play the videos with the proper quality. We were also working on another project involving Android and the TI DM3730. This device supported 1080P output and could be connected to a TV via HDMI. The display quality from this device was vastly superior to that of mobile screens.
Running mobile applications on the DM3730 was simple enough but there was no way to properly interact with the apps. All mobile apps are developed based on mobile device inputs, such as touch screens, accelerometers, etc. The DM3730 doesn’t have any of these. To correct this, we decided to add mobile controls to the DM3730.
It is from this that in 2011, BiggiFi was born!
We quickly shifted our focus to BiggiFi's development.
Three months later, the first prototype came out. Along with the necessary modifications made to the Android framework, we developed a server running on the DM3730 to receive control data, like user touch data from a smartphone, and feed it to those apps running on the DM3730. An app running on an Android smartphone collected touch screen data and transferred it to the server. When a user touches a position on their smartphone, this action is sent to the DM3730. We added a screenshot function to help orientate the user.
To assist the user with more precise actions, we also added a “mouse mode” which allows a smartphone to act as a trackpad. Both mode were very useful, so in the first prototype, we put two in the same screen, one in half screen. There were many games controlled by accelerometer as well, like racing games. So we supported sensor data transfer in the second version.
As we continued to develop BiggiFi and the BiggiFi app, we gained more and more control functions. Meantime we were also worked on compatibility with a select couple of games and apps
After one year of development, BiggiFi supported most Android apps. The next was to create a consumer product.We found a company in Shenzen that makes an HDMI device suited for BiggiFi. For the past year, we have been working closely with them to customize and optimize the device to meet the product specification of BiggiFi. We first need to modify the firmware and customize the Android to make it compatible with BiggiFi app. The WiFi performance is extremely important so we spent a lot of time to optimize the WiFi module that resulted in a second hardware spin. Initially, there are two PCB boards, in order to further reduce the cost, we combined two PCB boards into single PCB board. This is the third spin of the hardware. During this time, we have continued to optimize the software to improve user experience and easy of use. We also developed a functional prototype app for iOS.Why Indiegogo?
We have spent 2 years working on Biggifi and we need your help to go the final stretch to launch BiggiFi. There are some final software issues, such as performance issues and a redesign of the user interface to work out but other than that BiggiFi is complete and ready to ship. We have already secured a manufacturer (in China) who is willing to help us produce BiggiFi at an affordable price. We need your help to fund the first batche of the BiggiFi device as well as helping us with product fulfillment. We also need funds for FCC certification.Our beta stage BiggiFi app for iOS still requires extensive testing for any bugs or stability issues that need to be addressed We are also working to improve the auto-setup process. We hope additional resources will help facilitate this process.
Everyone's involvement with BiggiFi matters. You can help us to realize the dream to bring millions of apps right to your TV. By getting one of the first BiggiFi devices, you can help fund our enterprise and you can enjoy your favorite apps on TV right now!
Once our goal is met, we will immediately proceed to manufacture the first batch of the BiggiFi device and prepare it for delivery.

Whether it be a phone, light or camera mount, or a different brand of computer/GPS. Form Mount will have you covered, without the need to buy an entirely new mount.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Adaptability.</strong> The functionality of FormMount is unprecedented.

<strong>Fore/aft. </strong>A problem with other out front mounts is that they are limited to a fixed position. Not ideal with all the varied computer sizes on the market today. FormMount's fore/aft feature allows computers to be moved forward and backward to get in that just right position. Fore and aft adjustment is possible due to our patent pending internally detented design. Just slide the modular cradle assembly fore or aft into a position that works for you and your computer.</div><div> </div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/186124491?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div>
<p><strong>The Look.</strong> FormMount eliminates rubber bands, zip ties and bar clamps to quite literally become a natural extension of your bike. You get the best possible look and position.</p>

<p><strong>Stem width.</strong> A direct stem mount offers the cleanest possible look. Bolt patterns of every brand of stem vary, so this becomes an extremely limiting factor. FormMount's adjustable arms allow it accommodate virtually any 4 bolt stem that uses M5 threaded bolts, The adjustable arms will accomodate bolt distance between centers as narrow as .625"" to as wide as 1.625""(approx. 16mm to 41mm).</p>

<p><strong>WHO IS FORM MOUNT FOR?</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479511753/bihe43vhrpsleqeyqfjx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The short answer is: all cyclists.</strong> Upon first impression, it may seem like it's for avid cyclists with expensive bikes. That's simply not the case. Cycling enthusiasts from every discipline to commuters and recreational riders of all levels can all enjoy this multi-functional component. The versatility of FormMount to put your computer or phone or both in the optimal viewing position customized to rider preference is unparalleled. Because safety should be the #1 priority for anyone on 2 wheels. The FormMount system also offers cyclists the ability to record every moment with it's interchangeable bottom cradle to neatly mount a GoPro. Plus the GoPro cradle also mounts a light for all the night owls. And last but not least, for anyone who relishes in a clean look and feel. By mounting directly into the stem, FormMount clears everything off the handlebars.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>INSTALLATION.</strong></p>
<p>The ease of FormMount's installation and adjustability was well thought out and simple. Our supplied, custom M5  Stainless Steel stem bolts and spacer kit, make sure FormMount installs perfectly by maintaining the factory thread engagement of your stock setup.</p>
<p>The fore-aft positioning is a tool less movement using a unique Patent Pending ratcheting mechanism that allows you to get it in the position that works for you.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479425988/xhvfih873ncgjtetxiqc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Compatibility.</strong> As of now, FormMount supports Garmin and Wahoo, are hoping to have a few additional interfaces to offer in this campaign. We are working tirelessly to have Lezeyne, Bryton, Polar, Cateye and Sigma Sport ready to roll for no later than spring 2017. We know the importance of accommodating all major brands. Their interfaces will be designed to fit the current FormMount TCMI.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE RELENTLESS DEVELOPMENT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> create a bike computer mount that bolts directly into the stem. Make it adjustable, so it fits virtually any stem. Fit any size GPS computer. And offer multiple mounting positions. Sounds easy, right?</p>
<p>Every stem manufacturer has their own geometry based on what they think works best.  This in turn creates a large variation among the many different component manufacturers in stem clamp bolt distances between centers (BDBC), as well as stem clamp shapes.</p>
<p>We created a ¼ turn mount, attached to a cradle that slides along 2 tubes. The tubes get clamped in place by 2 of the bolts on a 4 bolt stem, either the upper or lower pair. By offsetting the tube bolt bosses relative to the tube centerlines in the cradle, we are able to rotate the tubes in the cradle, this changes the distance between the tube bolt boss centerlines, allowing them to match up to the many different BDBC of various stems. This system also allows the cradle to adjust fore and aft along the length of the tube to adjust for different size devices, or personal viewing preferences.</p>
<p>Now we're ready for execution. At this point, we have a concept we're confident will work, from a user experience and manufacturability standpoint. The next step is to make some prototypes. This is part of the R&amp;D phase where most of the refinement happens. Where having an actual prototype in hand and on the bike, allowed us to make leaps and bounds towards making the product the best it can be. Through use on the bike it was decided that friction fit alone was not enough to keep the fore and aft adjustable positions locked, so small steps were added to the geometry inside the cradle where the tube slides. A lot of knowledge was gained from working with the prototypes on and off the bike. 3D printing is a good first step in prototyping to test fit function and ergonomics.</p>

<strong>3D printed prototypes. </strong>Every prototype allowed us to inspect, test, analyze and refine until we, and our moms, were completely satisfied. These prototypes however, do not give real world results regarding durability. That's why once we were happy with the fit, function and ergonomics, the next step was to do a detailed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of our CAD model. That gave us an idea of how our mount would react to real world forces and vibration. FEA would show us where, if any, weak spots in the design were. After reviewing the FEA results, we knew our material choice of carbon or kevlar filled nylon for the parts, including the offset tubes, was the way to go. We chose to use stainless steel inserts for the offset tube bolt bosses to better handle the compression forces of the torqued stem bolts. The offset tubes will be overmolded onto the support sleeves in production.</div>
<div> <div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479427433/wxh4cbihtp9lq93mww1e.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<p><strong>Materials.</strong> Arms are Injection molded carbon or kevlar reinforced nylon, over-molded onto CNC machined Stainless Steel sleeves for strength, cradle/mounting area is Delrin for durability and positive computer fit. Delrin is a low friction nylon, chosen to reduce wear of engagement detail on underside of computers.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing.</strong> We will have complete oversight of quality control. The team has solid vendor/supplier relationships. One of the most solidified relationships is 3R Plastics in Spring Grove, Illinois. Our designer has been working them for over two decades. And they supported this project from its inception. We'll be using 3R to build the tooling and run FormMount's production. Our CAD is there and we've collaborated throughout the R&amp;D process of refinement and design for tooling. They are ready to start designing, building and running the tooling required to produce FormMount.</p>

</div></div>","Interface. FormMount’s modular design allows just one part (Top Cap Mount Interface) to be removed and swapped with the mount interface that fits your device. Whether it be a phone, light or camera mount, or a different brand of computer/GPS. Form Mount will have you covered, without the need to buy an entirely new mount. Adaptability. The functionality of FormMount is unprecedented. Rotating arms adjust to fit varied stem widths, and the design also allows 5 different mounting positions.
Fore/aft. A problem with other out front mounts is that they are limited to a fixed position. Not ideal with all the varied computer sizes on the market today. FormMount's fore/aft feature allows computers to be moved forward and backward to get in that just right position. Fore and aft adjustment is possible due to our patent pending internally detented design. Just slide the modular cradle assembly fore or aft into a position that works for you and your computer. 
The Look. FormMount eliminates rubber bands, zip ties and bar clamps to quite literally become a natural extension of your bike. You get the best possible look and position.

Stem width. A direct stem mount offers the cleanest possible look. Bolt patterns of every brand of stem vary, so this becomes an extremely limiting factor. FormMount's adjustable arms allow it accommodate virtually any 4 bolt stem that uses M5 threaded bolts, The adjustable arms will accomodate bolt distance between centers as narrow as .625"" to as wide as 1.625""(approx. 16mm to 41mm).

Spread the arms to fit a wide bolt pattern.

Or adjust to fit stem widths where the bolts are practically touching.
 
Stem height. Another versatile function of the arms allows it to be installed in 5 different height positions. This means you get to choose the location that works best for you.

1). The over the stem position is a popular choice for our phone mount. And mountain bikers.

2). The upper most out front position is another option for phones and large computers.

3). This is one of the more popular positions for most all computers and phones.

4). This position is the unanimous favorite among all cyclists we've polled. And with our new long arms, can accommodate the large computers for those who like it low and out front.

5). So many positions, it can be hard to decide. A good problem to have.
 
THE BUZZ.

We are honored to have the support from so many bike industry insiders.
 
THE COMPONENTS.

Computers: FormMount's design allows it to accommodate any computer size. From small, medium to large. You can choose shorter arms for small & medium-sized computers or longer arms for larger computers.  So no matter what computer you have, it can be put in the position of your choosing.




FormMount shown here with longer arms (added during our Kickstarter campaign) to accommodate any sized computer in the preferred low out front position.
 
Phones: We are very excited about this component for FormMount's modular system. It is currently in the final stages of development and will be available no later than spring of 2017.
Simply remove the TCMI (Top Cap Mount Interface) and attach the phone interface and you're set. Phone Mount Base will be made of injection molded ABS or Delrin. The base has 4 Neodymium disc magnets with over 7lbs. of pull force each, at 4 corners.
The phone case side is going to be stamped Stainless Steel. Phone case interface adheres easily to most any flat backed phone case with custom cut 3M VHB tape. No magnets are used on the phone case side interface. This protects items that can be damaged by magnets if phone is slipped into purse or beside a wallet.



Your phone can be docked in portrait or landscape position.


This video demonstrates how the 4 semi-circular details will allow the phone to securely dock in portrait or landscape mode.

 
Our phone case mount interface is cool looking, feels nice to the touch and razor thin.

Versatility is a hallmark of FormMount's platform. For those who want both a computer and a phone, you've got it. Heck, throw a light in there too. No matter what configuration you can dream up, FormMount will make sure you'll have the cleanest possible look.

Check out this field research demonstrating the durability when riding rough terrain.

GoPro: Our patent-pending cradle component is interchangeable with FormMount's standard cradle. It's a modular attachment that allows your GoPro to neatly mount underneath.


Lights: While we are not actually producing lights, there are many brands that use the GoPro type bracket. So you can cleanly mount a light underneath using our GoPro cradle component.



 
WHAT'S INCLUDED FOR BACKERS.
FormMount with standard bottom cradle.
Black aluminum bolt spacers to customize fit and stainless steel M5 bolts.

• Choice of inserts: Garmin or Wahoo. (additional interfaces may be added during this campaign but will available no later than spring 2017)
UPGRADED OPTIONS:
• Interchangeable GoPro bottom cradle: adds $9 to your pledge per mount and has a bundled perk option for that .  GoPro bottom cradle DSP = $12.95
We will be adding these upgrades in spring of 2017 available via our site: f3cycling.com
• Phone mount
• Titanium bolts
Another FormMount component we're working on for 2017 is Di2/EPS compatible attachment.

 
TIMEFRAME.
FormMount is already in production and we estimate delivery in March, 2017. The  phone mount component is in the final stages of development and will follow closely behind in the spring of 2017.

 
WHO IS FORM MOUNT FOR?

The short answer is: all cyclists. Upon first impression, it may seem like it's for avid cyclists with expensive bikes. That's simply not the case. Cycling enthusiasts from every discipline to commuters and recreational riders of all levels can all enjoy this multi-functional component. The versatility of FormMount to put your computer or phone or both in the optimal viewing position customized to rider preference is unparalleled. Because safety should be the #1 priority for anyone on 2 wheels. The FormMount system also offers cyclists the ability to record every moment with it's interchangeable bottom cradle to neatly mount a GoPro. Plus the GoPro cradle also mounts a light for all the night owls. And last but not least, for anyone who relishes in a clean look and feel. By mounting directly into the stem, FormMount clears everything off the handlebars.
 
INSTALLATION.
The ease of FormMount's installation and adjustability was well thought out and simple. Our supplied, custom M5  Stainless Steel stem bolts and spacer kit, make sure FormMount installs perfectly by maintaining the factory thread engagement of your stock setup.
The fore-aft positioning is a tool less movement using a unique Patent Pending ratcheting mechanism that allows you to get it in the position that works for you.


Compatibility. As of now, FormMount supports Garmin and Wahoo, are hoping to have a few additional interfaces to offer in this campaign. We are working tirelessly to have Lezeyne, Bryton, Polar, Cateye and Sigma Sport ready to roll for no later than spring 2017. We know the importance of accommodating all major brands. Their interfaces will be designed to fit the current FormMount TCMI.
 
THE RELENTLESS DEVELOPMENT.
Goal: create a bike computer mount that bolts directly into the stem. Make it adjustable, so it fits virtually any stem. Fit any size GPS computer. And offer multiple mounting positions. Sounds easy, right?
Every stem manufacturer has their own geometry based on what they think works best.  This in turn creates a large variation among the many different component manufacturers in stem clamp bolt distances between centers (BDBC), as well as stem clamp shapes.
We created a ¼ turn mount, attached to a cradle that slides along 2 tubes. The tubes get clamped in place by 2 of the bolts on a 4 bolt stem, either the upper or lower pair. By offsetting the tube bolt bosses relative to the tube centerlines in the cradle, we are able to rotate the tubes in the cradle, this changes the distance between the tube bolt boss centerlines, allowing them to match up to the many different BDBC of various stems. This system also allows the cradle to adjust fore and aft along the length of the tube to adjust for different size devices, or personal viewing preferences.
Now we're ready for execution. At this point, we have a concept we're confident will work, from a user experience and manufacturability standpoint. The next step is to make some prototypes. This is part of the R&D phase where most of the refinement happens. Where having an actual prototype in hand and on the bike, allowed us to make leaps and bounds towards making the product the best it can be. Through use on the bike it was decided that friction fit alone was not enough to keep the fore and aft adjustable positions locked, so small steps were added to the geometry inside the cradle where the tube slides. A lot of knowledge was gained from working with the prototypes on and off the bike. 3D printing is a good first step in prototyping to test fit function and ergonomics.


 

3D printed prototypes. Every prototype allowed us to inspect, test, analyze and refine until we, and our moms, were completely satisfied. These prototypes however, do not give real world results regarding durability. That's why once we were happy with the fit, function and ergonomics, the next step was to do a detailed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of our CAD model. That gave us an idea of how our mount would react to real world forces and vibration. FEA would show us where, if any, weak spots in the design were. After reviewing the FEA results, we knew our material choice of carbon or kevlar filled nylon for the parts, including the offset tubes, was the way to go. We chose to use stainless steel inserts for the offset tube bolt bosses to better handle the compression forces of the torqued stem bolts. The offset tubes will be overmolded onto the support sleeves in production.
 
 
Materials. Arms are Injection molded carbon or kevlar reinforced nylon, over-molded onto CNC machined Stainless Steel sleeves for strength, cradle/mounting area is Delrin for durability and positive computer fit. Delrin is a low friction nylon, chosen to reduce wear of engagement detail on underside of computers.
Manufacturing. We will have complete oversight of quality control. The team has solid vendor/supplier relationships. One of the most solidified relationships is 3R Plastics in Spring Grove, Illinois. Our designer has been working them for over two decades. And they supported this project from its inception. We'll be using 3R to build the tooling and run FormMount's production. Our CAD is there and we've collaborated throughout the R&D process of refinement and design for tooling. They are ready to start designing, building and running the tooling required to produce FormMount.
 

We have proudly teamed up with Chicagoland based PDT and 3R Plastics. Development through manufacturing makes FormMount 100% made in America. This American craftsmanship, attention to detail and ability to closely monitor the process gives us the confidence that FormMount will stand the test of time. This why we'll be offering a lifetime warranty to the original owner.

<p><b>Where do you ship to?</b></p>
<p>Our shipping partner uses multiple couriers for world wide delivery and we will ship to
anywhere that they deliver.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Is shipping included? 
</b></p>
<p>Shipping is not
included, we are building a custom portal for you to keep track of your
NexDock at <a href=""http://www.NexDock.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.NexDock.com</a>. We do this because it is much easier
for us to handle the shipping logistics of a world wide launch in
this way.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After the campaign is finished you will receive a personal login to NexDock.com and pay
for your shipping there. Approximate shipping cost will be $25 anywhere in Europe, and the USA. Other countries will vary depending
on your location.</p>

</p>
<p>Purchasers are responsible for any VAT or customs duties levied by their own
countries.</p>

<p><b>What are the risks and challenges?</b></p>
<p>NexDock is nearly complete. NexDock prototypes shown on this page and in the videos were built on our partner ODM's production line. We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan and we are ready to meet the estimated delivery times. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur and sometimes forecasts don’t always hit the mark. If this happens, we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible.</p>

NexDock is nearly complete. NexDock prototypes shown on this page and in the videos were built on our partner ODM's production line. We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan and we are ready to meet the estimated delivery times. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur and sometimes forecasts don’t always hit the mark. If this happens, we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible.",8.0,7,"1 Campaign

<p> There’s nothing worse than not having a USB cable when you need it, or reaching into your bag and pulling out a tangled mess of wires. ZiPAC solves the problem by combining a cable and a convenient case in one. Use the case as a purse, or to hold your mobile device, make-up, pens and pencils, whatever. Unzip it and voilà! You always have a USB cable for connecting and charging your devices.</p>
<p>The cable is USB 2.0 with a full size, flat USB connector on one end, with your choice of Lightning or microUSB on the other. It works with so many devices including: </p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 6, iPhone 6plus, iPhone 5, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c  </li>
<li>iPad Air 2, iPad Air and iPad 4 </li>

<h1>The ZiPAC Story</h1>
<p>Remember zipping your jacket or pencil case up and down when you were a kid? It was like magic the way those teeth stayed together. That seemingly magical experience is what inspired us to create ZiPAC. So we took the fun of a zipper and applied it to your charging cable. Just like a zipper kept your pens and pencils safe and secure, the ZiPAC protects your cable and other items. No more tangled up wires and always asking, “Where’s my cable?” ZiPAC is the fun, functional way of reminding us of simpler times.</p>

<p>Our idea for ZiPAC was simple: combine a zipper and a cable. But the implementation wasn’t quite as easy as we imagined. Combining the different materials together with electronic cabling and making it mass producible proved to be the biggest challenge. In the development stage, we tried a variety of integration methods and created a number of models. None delivered the durability and cost-effectiveness we were needed. After 18 Months, we finally arrived at the ZiPAC you see today and we couldn’t be happier. </p>

<br/><p>The electric antiblinding lamp <b>LIA</b> is established at the level of the main field of vision of the driver (level of eyes), on the left side of a windshield that doesn't disturb the driver at movement.</p>
<p>Light from a lamp extends parallel to a windshield and doesn't get to eyes of the driver. At inclusion of a lamp there is an absorption of considerable part of a stream of light of headlights of the counter car, reducing a flare of a retina of eyes.</p>
<p>Besides, use of the green light filter gives the chance to control a situation on the road as at night eyes of the person are most sensitive to blue and green beams of a visible range.</p>

<p>At movement of the car on the night road and lack of counter transport the LIA doesn't burn. In case of the counter car at a great distance when intensity of a light stream of headlights sufficient for dazzle of the driver, the LIA is lit that allows not only to absorb considerable part of a stream of light of headlights of the counter car, but also allows eyes of the driver to get used to bright light in advance. At loss of bright counter light, the LIA gradually dies away.</p>

</div></div>","The green lamp is one of antiblinding devices.
 We will consider usefulness of this automobile antiblinding device for the driver. In drawing the schedule of distribution of intensity of the range radiated by the incandescent lamp is shown. According to the schedule it is visible that its greatest part is made by red, orange and yellow beams which in the basic and light a retina of eyes of the driver. But the range seen by a human eye is ""below"" than an incandescent lamp range. Eyes are most sensitive to green and blue color.""To cut"" the brightest part of a range of headlights of the car, many drivers install at the top of a windshield passive light filters from strips of blue or green plexiglas, or a film. However passive light filters are very inconvenient since are above the main field of vision of the driver.
Besides, such light filter would be much more effective if was translucent - opaque, but it not expediently to do as will limit the review of the driver.

LIA:



The electric antiblinding lamp LIA is established at the level of the main field of vision of the driver (level of eyes), on the left side of a windshield that doesn't disturb the driver at movement.
Light from a lamp extends parallel to a windshield and doesn't get to eyes of the driver. At inclusion of a lamp there is an absorption of considerable part of a stream of light of headlights of the counter car, reducing a flare of a retina of eyes.
Besides, use of the green light filter gives the chance to control a situation on the road as at night eyes of the person are most sensitive to blue and green beams of a visible range.
The antiblinding lamp LIA allows eyes of the driver to adapt (to get used) to blinding influence of headlights of the counter car.


Principle of work simple.










At movement of the car on the night road and lack of counter transport the LIA doesn't burn. In case of the counter car at a great distance when intensity of a light stream of headlights sufficient for dazzle of the driver, the LIA is lit that allows not only to absorb considerable part of a stream of light of headlights of the counter car, but also allows eyes of the driver to get used to bright light in advance. At loss of bright counter light, the LIA gradually dies away.


Scheme of the automatic switching on and off the flashlight LIA has the following advantages:


in  the LIA mini batteries or accumulators are used.
fast ignition of a lamp at illumination of a photo cell by light of headlights of counter transport and smooth (units of seconds) its switching off reduce time of readaptation of eyes of the driver.
possibility of recharge of the LIA from the regular socket of the car.










As to use it.

Use of LIA is very simple.


 It needs to be fixed in interior on a car windshield from the driver near a lateral molding at the level of eyes (you watch the picture).
For steering of LIA has two switches:


1 - Inclusion and switching off. This switch is used for LIA inclusion. In the evening include LIA, in the afternoon - switch off. If you leave LIA in the included afternoon it in any way won't prevent, but operating time of batteries will be less.
2 - The switch for control of sensitivity of LIA. If you go around the city then put this switch in situation I if you have to go in the country we recommend to install the switch in situation II more.

Safety and permission


Green can communicate safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. 
Social status, prosperity and the dollar
Green in Europe and the United States is sometimes associated with status and prosperity. From the Middle Ages to the 19th century it was often worn by bankers, merchants country gentlemen and others who were wealthy but not members of the nobility. The benches in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, where the landed gentry sat, are colored green.
In the United States green was connected with the dollar bill. Since 1861,the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle the pictures on the front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Apart from the normal headset mode, Hushme has two more modes: passive and active.</span></p></figure></div>
<div data-id=""16376728""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496862180/zrbmvvtkrgrlfjau6wiu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p>In the normal headset mode, Hushme connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and you can use it as hands-free headset while speaking on the phone or listening to music.</p>
<div data-id=""16376763""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496862181/v7jtdkgwt5ghqzysn8de.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p>In the passive voice muffling mode, Hushme is locked over the mouth using magnetic coupling. This mode is provided by the innovative insulation materials, that are embedded inside the mask, by the extra soft cushion muffs and by the special sound-absorbing paint, that covers the whole inner surface of the device. So, people at the distance of 3 feet cannot decipher your words, while your speech is transmitted to the other end undistorted thanks to sensitive built-in microphone.</p>

<p>The active voice masking mode is provided by the electronics, which is located in the headband, and by the proprietary algorithms. Pressing the button activates the outer speakers, that are located on the perimeter of the mask, - these speakers will generate masking sounds.                    </p>
<div data-id=""16426604""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496862182/f9rfnqoldvdjkhupl0yq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>

<p> </p>
<p>According to the research by <a href=""http://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Noise/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American Speech-Language-Hearing Associacion</a>, the volume of a normal speech is 50-60 dB. Thanks to the insulating properties of its body, Hushme in passive mode is capable to lower some to 25 dB. Thus, the volume of the resulting sound using the mask will be approximately 25-30 dB, which corresponds to a whisper or noise level in a quiet library. Still one can decipher a whisper too if one wants to eavesdrop on you. In this case, we recommend using the active voice masking mode.</p>
<div data-id=""16426599""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496862184/q65qmkesimdefuz8mgt8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p>In the active voice masking mode, 4 speakers located on the outer surface of the device are activated, and the mask starts to produce a preset sound. A special algorithm modulates this sound relative to the intensity of your voice: the mask ""is silent"" when you are silent, it raises or lowers the volume or pauses completely following your voice. This masking sound adds approximately 12 dB. Thus, the resulting noise when using the active mode will be approximately 35-40 dB, which corresponds to the noise level in a quiet room.  </p>
<p>Finally, for maximum efficiency of the device, we recommend to lower the voice when you speak over the phone using Hushme, then you will ultimately protect your speech privacy and still will be heard perfectly well on the other end.</p>
<div data-id=""16405916""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496862184/ptnvfvgpdrqgsfhlrc3c.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>

<p>Hushme uses dedicated App to synchronize with your smart phone, which enables you to choose masking sounds from the library, upload your customized sounds, adjust volume, etc.</p>
<div data-id=""16330561""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496862186/ctecj5pazrjz13zd5xfd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p>The sounds of rain, wind and ocean are downloaded into the device by default. </p>
<p>The volume and the intensity of the masking sounds directly depends on the pace, rhythm and volume of your speech. </p>
<p>But, in any case, the output noise is lower in volume than the incoming speech.</p>
<div data-id=""16592882""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The device can also be used as a powerful wireless speaker that allows you to enjoy the music.</span></figure></div>

<h1>Story</h1>
<p>Back in 2015, three friends: CEO, CFO and CIO of a leading Ukrainian food company, were sitting in a café downtown Kiev and came across the problem of speech privacy protection.

</div></div>","After our participation at CES 2017 and Wearable Technology Show:

Apart from the normal headset mode, Hushme has two more modes: passive and active.

In the normal headset mode, Hushme connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and you can use it as hands-free headset while speaking on the phone or listening to music.

In the passive voice muffling mode, Hushme is locked over the mouth using magnetic coupling. This mode is provided by the innovative insulation materials, that are embedded inside the mask, by the extra soft cushion muffs and by the special sound-absorbing paint, that covers the whole inner surface of the device. So, people at the distance of 3 feet cannot decipher your words, while your speech is transmitted to the other end undistorted thanks to sensitive built-in microphone.

The cushion muffs are replaceable, so you can remove it in order to clean or to replace with new muffs.

The size-adjusting system allows to set up the right size of the mask so it could fit any face.

The active voice masking mode is provided by the electronics, which is located in the headband, and by the proprietary algorithms. Pressing the button activates the outer speakers, that are located on the perimeter of the mask, - these speakers will generate masking sounds.                    

 

 
According to the research by American Speech-Language-Hearing Associacion, the volume of a normal speech is 50-60 dB. Thanks to the insulating properties of its body, Hushme in passive mode is capable to lower some to 25 dB. Thus, the volume of the resulting sound using the mask will be approximately 25-30 dB, which corresponds to a whisper or noise level in a quiet library. Still one can decipher a whisper too if one wants to eavesdrop on you. In this case, we recommend using the active voice masking mode.

In the active voice masking mode, 4 speakers located on the outer surface of the device are activated, and the mask starts to produce a preset sound. A special algorithm modulates this sound relative to the intensity of your voice: the mask ""is silent"" when you are silent, it raises or lowers the volume or pauses completely following your voice. This masking sound adds approximately 12 dB. Thus, the resulting noise when using the active mode will be approximately 35-40 dB, which corresponds to the noise level in a quiet room.  
Finally, for maximum efficiency of the device, we recommend to lower the voice when you speak over the phone using Hushme, then you will ultimately protect your speech privacy and still will be heard perfectly well on the other end.

 

Hushme uses dedicated App to synchronize with your smart phone, which enables you to choose masking sounds from the library, upload your customized sounds, adjust volume, etc.

The sounds of rain, wind and ocean are downloaded into the device by default. 
The volume and the intensity of the masking sounds directly depends on the pace, rhythm and volume of your speech. 
But, in any case, the output noise is lower in volume than the incoming speech.
The device can also be used as a powerful wireless speaker that allows you to enjoy the music.

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Since the 1920’s a combat support arm of the British Army has excelled with its engineers, logistic experts and system operators. This pedigree of soldier is exceptional at installing, maintaining and operating essential telecommunications infrastructures and information systems around the world. The Royal Corps of Signals is now home to Britain’s defence and force in Cyberspace.</p>
<p>In 2011 the most pioneering 1% of Royal Signals personnel, <em>(all educated at the Defence School of Communications and Information Systems (DSCIS))</em>, formed what is now known as the Extropy Trust. A forward thinking group which have financed important research into trends between our leaders’ future visions and the early development of new era of technologies which meet the collective demands of these future visions.  </p>

<p>Their research and development findings gave rise to a new Charter which states that society’s biggest leap forward in the information age will only occur, once our ability to communicate digitally is transformed: ‘<em>from an affordable privilege to a free and inherent right’</em>.

<ul>
<li>The commercial viability comes from a small alliance that was established between a regional networks and a digital advertising agencies in 2011.

Sit down, please! Yes, it’s that kind of idea. Ebooks, audiobooks, music and movies on greeting cards!!!First physical carrier for ebooks! Now you can offer a greeting card to your friends, relatives and partners with an Ebook included!How come?  Simple. The Ebook (audiobook,music,movie) will be attached using a QR Code. Scan the Code with your smartphone or tablet and the book is all set to be read. (plus you you’ll be able to download the ebook in ebup and pdf formats)Simple, isn’t it? And yes, we’ve applied for a patent, to combine the greeting cards industry with ebooks, audiobooks industry. And with your help we’ll create a new sub-industry: Ebooks on greeting cards. Starting with only 7$ for a greeting card with an Ebook included!!!A synergy between classic and modern! Technological winds on the culture sails! We deeply hope that this project will stimulate the reading of books. This is one of the main ideas of the project. A great gift for your friends! A special one for special ones. And the greeting cards..! You should see them! An amazingly talented and funny team of graphic designers created something special for you! ( see part of them below this article). We aren’t done with surprises yet. You will be able to customize your greeting card on our website magnamoments.club by choosing the ebook, message, design. The most important: you’ll be able to create your video greeting by recording yourself and uploading your video on our website and your video greeting will be attached to your greeting card by a second QR Code. And the final surprise of our project is the eChokoBooks. It’s a product that should help to stimulate reading among kids. eBooks on chocolates&cookies. The idea is that we cannot totally avoid the consumption of sweets by children. So let’s use it to get a noble goal: “Want a cookie? Read the book from cookies package”. The ebooks,audiobooks,movies will be attached on chocolates and cookies by an QR Code as well.Who we are and where the ideas came from?We are an international enthusiastic team of Americans, Moldovans, Russians and Romanians. We love innovations and art as well. Graphic designers and engineers, managers and writers. Altogether we’re impressed by the project we did and will be doing our best to create a great product for you.The idea. Hey, I’m Mariu Marin the founder of this talented start up and the author of the idea. During my travels through America I was really impressed how many greeting cards Americans send to their relatives and friends. It’s a really nice tradition. At the same time many voices were complaining about the decrease of level of book reading in the USA. And since I’m a problem solver☺ I thought why not to combine these 2 industries to create a new one as an incentive to art of reading. Simple☺ My previous successful projects make me confident that with my highly talented and motivated team we’ll build a really awesome product.Our Goals and What We Want from YouLike we’ve mentioned the stimulation of reading is one of our biggest goals.

Doesn’t it get cumbersome?</strong></p><p>We are happy to say that the X5+ comes with a completely detachable hub which allows you to remove the X5+’s back hub completely (cord and all) and store it in your glove box, bag or purse. This allows you to still use the frontal charging hub but also helps to declutter your car!</p><p> </p><p><strong>How do I pick a color?</strong></p><p>Simply pick a perk and then you will be prompted to pick your X5+ perk color(s) from a drop down menu.

We are sure with our seasoned logistics line alongside the factors above that we will ship your products. This is why we are offering guaranteed shipping on all perks.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why is the X5+ different from other chargers?</strong></p><p>For a full breakdown of the features of the X5+ versus competitors there is a great comparison table in our campaign story section for you to check out. For the sake of a summary though, the X5+ has tons of unique features like its 3 charging port options, its completely detachable hub and its value for the number of features it has.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Does this only charge USB type devices?</strong></p><p>The X5+ has the following charging portion options: One Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 port, one USB Type-C port, and 3 USB-A ports that supply up to 2.4amp each. Unfortunately the X5+ doesn’t accommodate devices that don’t use one of these charging cords. However, these 3 charging options accommodate a ton of devices so hopefully your devices are covered!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why are there two different shipping dates?</strong></p><p>RapidX has already started to manufacture one batch of products which will be the batch we deliver to early bird backers. Then, based on the response to our campaign another batch will be manufactured to be shipped to our backers from later in the campaign. If you don’t know for sure which shipping date applies to you the estimated shipping dates for each perk can be found in the perk section above.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I would like to pick a perk with more/less units than the one I selected.

Who said fashion and function could live in harmony in one device? Seamless Hub DetachabilityThe X5+'s back hub is connected to the frontal charging unit via a wire making it extendable and easily passed back and clipped anywhere in the rear of your car. This creates 2 charging zones for both front-seat and backseat passengers to enjoy. You can also completely detach the back hub when you don't have any passengers to please and store it in your glove box or bag  to declutter your car. This allows you to use just the X5+'s frontal charging unit with no cords attached. The versatility the detachable hub provides really sets the X5+ apart from the competition and is sure to keep everyone happy, no matter how many or how few people are in your car.Proof of ConceptWhat stage is the X5+ project at? We are happy to report that not only do we have fully functional production-quality prototypes but we are also in the process of manufacturing the first batch! Check out this video an X5+ prototype charging a range of devices:


 

And here are a number of images of the internal components of an X5+ product straight of the assembly line:
 And for those who really want to see what's going on behind the scenes - some miscellaneous photos from our factory: Risks and ChallengesHere at RapidX we have a long track record of launching successful products, and have thousands of happy customers worldwide. We have also already begun production of the X5+ that will be shipped to all our generous backers. For these reasons we are so confident in our ability to deliver the X5+ in line with our estimated timeline that we are offering guaranteed shipping to all backers.Although we are confident in our supply chain management and production capability. There is always a small chance of uncontrollable factors, such as component delays or unexpected shortages to occur if the number of backers to our campaign greatly exceeds our expectations.We will be sure to keep you well informed every step of the way and do our best to quickly solve any problems that emerge. And most of all, we here at RapidX are excited to get the X5+ into your hands! FAQsWhat can I do with that cable that attaches the hubs together when there is no one in car? Doesn’t it get cumbersome?We are happy to say that the X5+ comes with a completely detachable hub which allows you to remove the X5+’s back hub completely (cord and all) and store it in your glove box, bag or purse. This allows you to still use the frontal charging hub but also helps to declutter your car! How do I pick a color?Simply pick a perk and then you will be prompted to pick your X5+ perk color(s) from a drop down menu. We are excited to see what colors you pick! I’ve backed crowdfunding campaigns before and didn’t receive my perk. How do I know I’ll receive my X5+?We at RapidX have a strong track record of delivering technology products to tens of thousands of customers previous customers and we stand behind our ability to deliver. Not only have we already almost finished manufacturing our first batch but we have more X5+s being made soon. We are sure with our seasoned logistics line alongside the factors above that we will ship your products. This is why we are offering guaranteed shipping on all perks. Why is the X5+ different from other chargers?For a full breakdown of the features of the X5+ versus competitors there is a great comparison table in our campaign story section for you to check out. For the sake of a summary though, the X5+ has tons of unique features like its 3 charging port options, its completely detachable hub and its value for the number of features it has. Does this only charge USB type devices?The X5+ has the following charging portion options: One Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 port, one USB Type-C port, and 3 USB-A ports that supply up to 2.4amp each. Unfortunately the X5+ doesn’t accommodate devices that don’t use one of these charging cords. However, these 3 charging options accommodate a ton of devices so hopefully your devices are covered! Why are there two different shipping dates?RapidX has already started to manufacture one batch of products which will be the batch we deliver to early bird backers. Then, based on the response to our campaign another batch will be manufactured to be shipped to our backers from later in the campaign. If you don’t know for sure which shipping date applies to you the estimated shipping dates for each perk can be found in the perk section above. I would like to pick a perk with more/less units than the one I selected. What do I do?For all such inquiries please contact team@rapidx.io and we will come up with a solution for you to get the number of RapidX units you were hoping to get. If I have more questions, how do I get in touch?If you are a backer you can contact with a direct message, a public comment or by contacting us via email directly at team@rapidx.io .

<p><font color=""#6a6a6a"">To ensure we didn't have any similar problems, we had produced small quantities of samples from several manufacturers and have found one which meets our requirements.</font></p>

<p><font color=""#6a6a6a"">We will be receiving the next batch of boards, components and housings from four different manufacturers and suppliers over the next 12 days or so and hopefully look forward to resuming delivery of the WiFlux then.</font></p>
<p><font color=""#6a6a6a"">The journey on this product has certainly been challenging, and we couldn't thank you more for your patience.</font></p>

<p>In order to keep up with the pace of modern power consumption, many resort to carrying additional power packs in an effort to remain connected in this wireless world. Portable charging in this manner seems like the stone age, especially when wireless charging and ultra thin lithium polymer batteries are already a reality.</p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/47263/files/20130901230110-card.jpg?1378101670"" src="""" style=""""/></b>WiFlux takes the concept of charging wirelessly a step further by creating a portable power bank that incorporates inductive charging and squeezing it into a card sized product.</p>
<p>Charging up a mobile device would be as easy as sticking the WiFlux Card onto the back of your phone. Its low profile and unobtrusive design would mean no more bulky power packs, no more cables, and no more mess.<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>

<p></p>
<p>By eliminating the need for cables and reducing the overall physical footprint of the portable charger, we seek to liberate the mobile device by making it truly wireless.</p>
<p>This is done by:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Reducing the inductive charging base to the size of a credit card</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Integrating the inductive coil with the thinnest battery possible and charging circuitry into a package that is 5mm thick, or even thinner</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The intended RRP of this product is USD 39.90 per set which comprises the WiFlux charging card and the charging receiver.</p>
<p>For now, two versions of the WiFlux charging system will be available.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For the Samsung Galaxy (S2, S3 and S4)</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For the iPhone 4, 4S and 5</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If we significantly exceed the funding goals of this campaign, we would be glad to extend the product further to include more devices. Focussing on a smaller number of mobile devices now, means getting the initial WiFlux card just right.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Proof of Concept</h3>We have carried out proof of concept tests with the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S2 to date. Devices successfully drew the 100mA minimum charge required from the WiFlux wireless charging card, and we are working out the necessary circuitry to fully utilise the 500mA coming from the receiver end.<p></p>
<p>The following videos demonstrate the initial tests carried out with the Mark 1 Mod 1 prototype of the WiFlux card on the iPhone 4S and Samsung Galaxy S2.</p>

On The Go Wireless Charging

UpdatesWe have had some difficulty getting the prefabricated components and boards for this project from the previous circuit manufacturer — our small order quantity, in addition to being delayed, were not to spec, which caused a safety concern, and we had to reject those components. Subsequently, we had to rely on a more reliable component service which was a little more expensive. 
To ensure we didn't have any similar problems, we had produced small quantities of samples from several manufacturers and have found one which meets our requirements.
Some of you have already received the first few units that we had made from these small quantities, and we are glad that the unit is working out well.
We will be receiving the next batch of boards, components and housings from four different manufacturers and suppliers over the next 12 days or so and hopefully look forward to resuming delivery of the WiFlux then.
The journey on this product has certainly been challenging, and we couldn't thank you more for your patience.

Project Brief
In order to keep up with the pace of modern power consumption, many resort to carrying additional power packs in an effort to remain connected in this wireless world. Portable charging in this manner seems like the stone age, especially when wireless charging and ultra thin lithium polymer batteries are already a reality.
WiFlux takes the concept of charging wirelessly a step further by creating a portable power bank that incorporates inductive charging and squeezing it into a card sized product.
Charging up a mobile device would be as easy as sticking the WiFlux Card onto the back of your phone. Its low profile and unobtrusive design would mean no more bulky power packs, no more cables, and no more mess.





Truly Wireless. True Freedom.

By eliminating the need for cables and reducing the overall physical footprint of the portable charger, we seek to liberate the mobile device by making it truly wireless.
This is done by:


Reducing the inductive charging base to the size of a credit card
Integrating the inductive coil with the thinnest battery possible and charging circuitry into a package that is 5mm thick, or even thinner


The intended RRP of this product is USD 39.90 per set which comprises the WiFlux charging card and the charging receiver.
For now, two versions of the WiFlux charging system will be available.


For the Samsung Galaxy (S2, S3 and S4)
For the iPhone 4, 4S and 5

If we significantly exceed the funding goals of this campaign, we would be glad to extend the product further to include more devices. Focussing on a smaller number of mobile devices now, means getting the initial WiFlux card just right.

Proof of ConceptWe have carried out proof of concept tests with the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S2 to date. Devices successfully drew the 100mA minimum charge required from the WiFlux wireless charging card, and we are working out the necessary circuitry to fully utilise the 500mA coming from the receiver end.
The following videos demonstrate the initial tests carried out with the Mark 1 Mod 1 prototype of the WiFlux card on the iPhone 4S and Samsung Galaxy S2.



The Specifications


The WiFlux Card comes with built in 850mAh lithium polymer battery
Charges via USB max 500mA at 5V input
Minimum output of 100mA at 5V on secondary coil (receiver)


In the Package
The plan is to ship the WiFlux Card in a standard package that comprises the following:


The WiFlux Card
The charging receiver, which connects to the mobile device / battery
A mini USB charging cable We have integrated the USB charging circuitry into the WiFlux card design


Shipping Dates
The first preproduction beta model of the WiFlux Cards are expected to leave the production lines on January 31st, 2014.
The first production model WiFlux Card should be available by February 28th, 2014.
Shipping is already included in the price of the perks.

Wishlist
We would love to see a more powerful built in battery, or super capacitors if it helped, in the WiFlux design. We would also love to accommodate more phone models in the WiFlux range. 
If we exceed the funding goal, all this is possible. But we would need your support. Whether it is an idea for the WiFlux card, a great offer on costs of fabrication and parts, or even a ""like"" or ""+1"" on our campaign page, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.

<p>Sybay Health is undoubtedly creating innovative and cheeky preventative healthcare solutions, but it’s addressing a very serious problem. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 11 percent of the world’s population, yet bears 24% of the global disease burden. It has the world’s shortest life expectancy, largely caused by communicable and parasitic diseases stamped out in the developed world; two thirds of the global burden of HIV/Aids; sanitation and nutrition; rising rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity and cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Put simply, Sub-Saharan Africa needs better preventative care and access to healthcare!</strong> We are now at full implementation stage and need your help to make this a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Who We Are?</strong></p>
<p>Sybay Health is social enterprise that was founded on a single premise, which is making <strong>healthcare access for all a possibility</strong> in Sub-Saharan Africa through affordable healthcare supplies and preventative care EHR and SMS platforms. We are creating a vehicle for inspiring Africans to be active in their healthcare and a way to provide affordable quality medical supplies to every village and beyond!</p>
<p>We do care and strongly believe the future of healthcare access in Africa is tied to technology platforms and availability of affordable healthcare supplies. We do give 20% of our profits to the Foundation to support free clinics and distribute medical supplies to the under privileged. We support 100% FREE EHR and Patient Support platforms. </p>

<p>Our sights are set and we're ready to take off! We are now in a position to fully resolve these healthcare challenges with your support.</p>
<p>First challenge:  <strong>how do we make supplies available to remote villages and beyond at an affordable price?</strong> We have learnt there are a lot of valuable lessons to be leveraged from how Coca-Cola has made it possible to have soft drink in almost every village. We created distribution model that hinges on public bus transport infrastructure coupled with the ability to secure each shipment physically and through SMS tracking when delivered to each destination. This will make us be able to make diabetes care supplies for example available at how the price, current market rate.</p>
<p>Second Challenge: <strong>how to make sustainable and responsible healthcare access for all? </strong>We have created a free EHR system for the physician offices that is able to work turn online/offline. The system is able to send/receive SMS messages from the patients and the mobile kiosks where patient can send in their vitals. For example: if how have diabetes for example, we will be able to provide affordable supplies and can directly communicate with the doctor by sending in blood sugar levels each day through SMS. If no doctor is assigned, the system is able to provide feedback automatically based on personal information.  </p>

<p>Having a passion for yachts and working within the yacht industry for the past few years prompted me to develop a Yacht Interactive concept. My creative skills also played a huge role in the development, and I am very happy to have the opportunity to present this project to you, my potential contributors.</p>
<p>Hopefully Yacht Interactive digital signage will intrigue you and my campaign will receive the needed attention and support.</p>
<p><strong>What it is all about</strong></p>
<p>“Yacht Interactive” is the project name of my concept - an interactive digital signage specially designed for yachts. The signage will be driven by content manager software supporting multiple file types, which will also allow easy control and deployment of that content. The content itself will be comprised of files including photos, videos, live web cams, weather, vessel tracking and web content.</p>
<p>Being a flexible platform, implementation of custom and additional modules will be seamlessly possible.</p>
<p>This is in brief the technical side of the project and if you need more information in that aspect please do not hesitate to contact me. I will be glad to provide the answer to any questions you may have.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Now, to explain how I envision the purpose of this digital signage - it is very simple, really. </p>
<p>Digital signages have been put into requisition for awhile, but what sets this one apart is the targeting industry.</p>
<p>A few groups can and will benefit if my concept develops into a real product.</p>
<p>Here is how the signage could be used.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Yacht Builders: For a Ship Builder Yacht Interactive could be a modern, innovative way of marketing exposure, presenting up current and previous builds to potential buyers and clients. The mobility of the product will allow easy transportation and installation of the signage from a shipyard to a boat show booth, or any other desired location.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Yacht Owners: For a Luxury Boat Owner a digital signage could make the experience of following the build progress less anxious and the time on board even more enjoyable. Featured functions will make it possible to keep an eye on how funds are utilized throughout all stages – from steel cut of the Hull to outfitting; create lifetime memories from all places visited; impress guests with a virtual tour of the boat in the comfort of the owner’s home or office; communicate efficiently with crew and receive real time updates from them when necessary.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Yacht Crew: Crew could use “Yacht Interactive” during a boat show - to present digitally impenetrable sections of the boat or features of her audio-video, navigation systems and etc. Possibility of yacht management system implementation will ease the process of keeping track of inventory, technical maintenance schedule and daily reports. Last but not least, a digital signage will feature a “one click” connection for communication with the yacht owner, charter guests or Management Company.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Yacht Brokers: One of the most difficult jobs in the Yachting Industry – of those, involved with marketing a boat for sale or charter, could very well benefit from Yacht Interactive not only by effectively facilitating later searching and cataloguing images, but such stunning digital presentation, comprised of high quality pictures, video reels and live high definition virtual tours will undoubtedly lead to a successful stroke of business.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Yacht Management companies: The presence of Yacht Interactive Display in the lobby of any Management Company will absolutely attract observation of curious visitors. Such modern approach will allow ability to manage efficiently entire fleet with the tools provided by this digital signage. Last, but not least Yacht Interactive will facilitate one of the important connections between a Management company and its clients - close relationship with owners and crew.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Charter Guests deserve to receive the maximum pleasure out of a charter. For convenience, Yacht Interactive will furnish visuals of the yacht layout, so guests can quickly find their way around while on board; review charter daily activities, as well as the food menu and submit special meal requests; communicate efficiently with the crew and other guests; leave testimonials about their experience upon departure; and finally – to inquire about availability of the yacht in order to book their future charter.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>General Public: Presence of Yacht Interactive signage will be suitable for International Boat Shows in the utmost degree. The signage’s features will promote digital exposition of interior and exterior guests’ areas without accessibility to visitors of the Boat Show. Not only Yacht Interactive will satisfy their curiosity as to information about builder information and technical specifications, but will allow viewers to experience an onboard “live tour” by browsing through the boat’s 3D interactive model with images and videos.</li>
</ul><p><strong>What I need and you will get</strong></p>
<p>Here is some good news<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>My design has been well received by number of professionals in yachting and I am currently in negations with one of the leaders in digital signage industry, who is eager to make a working prototype based on my concept. Existing technology makes this possible, and at this point the realization of my project is just a matter of gathering the sufficient funds. At present I am a single unit with my idea and concept, with strong believes that this will become a successful product.
