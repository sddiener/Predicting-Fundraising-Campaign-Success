From brainstorming, designing, to prototyping and manufacturing, it has taken us about a year.   UVCliin team members major in photonics and optoelectronics, led by Dr. Kevin Chen, we have dedicated ourselves to the research and development of UVC LED technologies, and we aim to design functional and safe products to meet people’s daily needs. We hope that our design can enable people to bring back home good memories instead of unpleasant germs after a trip, and can feel safe and stay healthy at all times. Press Kit View on YouTube",61.0,0,"1 Campaign

Risks & Challenges

The greatest challenge we see is consumer education. To get the word out, we are serving our teas at conscious events throughout the US. Hope to see you soon!",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

Life. </p>
<p>
Tại đất nước
tôi, vấn đề đồng tính luyến ái vẫn là điều cấm kỵ và vẫn tồn tại sự kỳ thị, bạo
hành trong đó. Chúng tôi đã có rất nhiều trường hợp nữ đồng tính bị bạo hành từ
chính trong gia đình của họ, từ cha mẹ và người thân. Không dừng ở bạo hành
tinh thần, thể xác họ còn bị bạo hành về tình dục (cưỡng ép phải quan hệ với
người khác giới), bạo hành về kinh tế (khống chế tài chính). Điều đáng buồn nhất
là chưa một tổ chức nào tại Việt Nam có sự hỗ trợ can thiệp nào dành cho nữ đồng
tính. </p>
<p>
Living My

bạo hành có thể tìm đến hoặc chúng tôi có thể can thiệp hỗ trợ và giúp đỡ khi họ
bị bạo hành. Ngoài ra chúng tôi còn cung cấp nơi lưu trú, ăn ở dành cho những
người có trường hợp khẩn cấp. Chúng tôi có những dịch vụ hỗ trợ như tư vấn tâm
lý, giới thiệu việc làm hoặc học nghề cho những người nữ đồng tính đó trong thời

<p>Licensed
Acupuncturist and facial rejuvenation specialist, Rebecca Underdown began the
development of Veridatta products to slow down the process of aging.  6 years of research, development, testing,
and formulation, the system was completed in February 2015.  The products have been used on a control group
based in New York and California for the last 6 years and has a strong grass roots following.  </p>

BREATHING ORGAN and deserves to breathe. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>WATCH the </h1><h1><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7UbSxP69D0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">15 DAY SUPPLY How-To Video</a></h1><div><br/></div><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">HOW IS VERIDATTA DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER SKIN
CARE ROUTINE?</b><br/></p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>The Veridatta Kit (6 products) work
synergistically to increase the cellular turnover through the process of detoxification.  </p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>Globally sourced, every single ingredient
has a specific action to regenerate or hydrate the skin cells. </p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>It’s handmade and includes ORGANIC PLANT
STEM CELLS imported from Italy that increase regeneration. </p>
<p>4.<span>  </span>It works!!!   We are so confident that it
does, we’ll prove it to you in 15 days. </p>
<h3><b>WHAT DO OTHER SKIN CARE CREAMS HAVE THAT WE
DON’T?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Phthalates:</b> often associated with
artificial fragrance is considered a hormone disruptor, and is known to cause
serious reproductive and developmental effects. </p>
<p><b>Parabens: </b>which are chemicals used as
preservatives.  They are cheap and
effective in fighting bacteria which is why companies use them.  BUT, they mimic the hormone estrogen which
has been proven to increase cancerous cells in the body tissue. </p>
<p><b>Sulfates:</b> caustic detergents used by
almost every mainstream personal care skin care company today because they are
a cheap way to cut grease or create a foamy lather. They are used in driveway
de-greasers!  Sulfates denature the
proteins on our skin making them a cancerous mutagen.  Not cool. </p>
<p><b>Propylene Glycol: </b> THIS IS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN ANTI-FREEZE!!
Direct contact can cause brain, liver, and kidney abnormalities. The EPA
requires workers to wear protective gloves, clothing, and goggles when working
with it.  We are not into
antifreeze.  </p>
<p><b>Mineral oil:</b>  A petroleum derivative that coats the skin
like Saran Wrap, which prevents the skin from breathing, absorbing, and
excreting. It also slows the skin’s natural cell development, causing the skin
to age prematurely. Note that baby oil is 100% mineral oil—and 100% bad for
your baby’s sensitive skin.  The skin
CANNOT breathe with Vaseline and nor is it being moisturized.  </p>
<p><b>Polyethylene Glycol or PEGs:</b> dissolve oil
and grease and are most commonly used in spray-on oven cleanser and skin
products.  We don’t want to treat your
skin like an oven. </p>

have been fighting for the last 5 years is finally under control.  I can go almost entirely make up free!  I have spent countless dollars on creams

<p>“I have been
modeling for 7 years and I have been fighting acne since I started.  This is a difficult thing to face each day
when I have to show my face to the world. 
Make-up has always been a part of my daily routine.  I’ve been using Veridatta for 2 months and it
took about a week to see a difference in my skin.  The breakouts slowly stopped and I feel like
my skin can breathe.  I am now more aware
of how I need to keep the layers open so I am wearing less make-up and I am
getting more complements.  I’m psyched.’  -<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Lauren</span></p>

“I have a long 'skin story' that involves
incredibly sensitive and acne prone skin. I am post-accutane treatment five
years ago and I have not changed my skin regimen for at least the same amount
of time in fear of triggering acne outbreaks.  
</p>
<p>The
Day Repair adds the perfect amount of moisture under my makeup without looking
too 'wet'. The night repair is absolutely decadent and I can't wait until the
day is over just to wash my face and lather it on. Veridatta has really have
created a wonderful product. I have had no sensitivity issues, and now I can
say I have successfully strayed from my skin regimen for the first time in
years without ill effect. This is huge for me. Because of my
experience, I  have also introduced the Night Repair in my aesthetic
practice for my post chemical peel clients with rave reviews. It's the perfect
post treatment cream.”  -Dr. Glenna</p>

<p>“Veridatta is
a collection where you witness all of the products work together,
synergistically throughout the day.  I am
a makeup artist and have been using products all of my life and I have never
seen one line work so effectively.  I
love the eye serum the most as it does not burn my eyes and I notice I do not
have puffiness or dark circles when using it. 
The scrub is not harsh but extremely moisturizing which is unlike any
other scrub I have ever used.  I have
been in love with my skin as soon as I started using Veridatta.” -Anonymous </p>

Acupuncturist and facial rejuvenation specialist, Rebecca Underdown began the
development of Veridatta products to slow down the process of aging.  6 years of research, development, testing,
and formulation, the system was completed in February 2015.  The products have been used on a control group
based in New York and California for the last 6 years and has a strong grass roots following.

IN JUST 15 DAYS of using the product, WE WILL SHOW YOU THAT YOUR SKIN IS A LIVING,
BREATHING ORGAN and deserves to breathe. WATCH the 15 DAY SUPPLY How-To VideoHOW IS VERIDATTA DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER SKIN
CARE ROUTINE?
1.  The Veridatta Kit (6 products) work
synergistically to increase the cellular turnover through the process of detoxification.  
2.  Globally sourced, every single ingredient
has a specific action to regenerate or hydrate the skin cells. 
3.  It’s handmade and includes ORGANIC PLANT
STEM CELLS imported from Italy that increase regeneration. 
4.  It works!!!   We are so confident that it
does, we’ll prove it to you in 15 days. 
WHAT DO OTHER SKIN CARE CREAMS HAVE THAT WE
DON’T?

Phthalates: often associated with
artificial fragrance is considered a hormone disruptor, and is known to cause
serious reproductive and developmental effects. 
Parabens: which are chemicals used as
preservatives.  They are cheap and
effective in fighting bacteria which is why companies use them.  BUT, they mimic the hormone estrogen which
has been proven to increase cancerous cells in the body tissue. 
Sulfates: caustic detergents used by
almost every mainstream personal care skin care company today because they are
a cheap way to cut grease or create a foamy lather. They are used in driveway
de-greasers!  Sulfates denature the
proteins on our skin making them a cancerous mutagen.  Not cool. 
Propylene Glycol:  THIS IS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN ANTI-FREEZE!!
Direct contact can cause brain, liver, and kidney abnormalities. The EPA
requires workers to wear protective gloves, clothing, and goggles when working
with it.  We are not into
antifreeze.  
Mineral oil:  A petroleum derivative that coats the skin
like Saran Wrap, which prevents the skin from breathing, absorbing, and
excreting. It also slows the skin’s natural cell development, causing the skin
to age prematurely. Note that baby oil is 100% mineral oil—and 100% bad for
your baby’s sensitive skin.  The skin
CANNOT breathe with Vaseline and nor is it being moisturized.  
Polyethylene Glycol or PEGs: dissolve oil
and grease and are most commonly used in spray-on oven cleanser and skin
products.  We don’t want to treat your
skin like an oven. 
VERIDATTA IS FAST, EASY, AND EFFECTIVE:
3-minute morning
routine:
1.  Wash your face with the Sea Foam Cleanser: designed to open the
layers of the skin up to allow detoxification. 2.  Spritz your face with Skin Tight Toner: designed to tighten and tone the outer layers of
the skin.
  3.  Apply Raw
Coconut Day Repair:  designed to continue
the detoxification process of the skin throughout your day to improve
REGENERATION OF SKIN CELLS.  Oh, and of
course the raw coconut water hydrates and sets your glow for the day.
3-minute night
routine:
1. Scrub with the Living Enzyme Scrub: designed to gently exfoliate skin cells that need to be removed from your body and supply body with healthy bacteria.2.  Apply The
Truth Serum to the entire face: 
designed to decrease sun spots, wrinkles, fine lines, and dark circles.
3.  Apply Naked
Night Repair:  designed to balance
the sebaceous (oil) glands of the skin, hydrate, and regenerate your skin cells
while you sleep.
You don't have to take OUR word for it:
“I received
this skin care regimen as a gift and I have been blown away.  It has lightened all the dark marks, made my
skin even toned, super soft, less fine lines, and most importantly, the acne I
have been fighting for the last 5 years is finally under control.  I can go almost entirely make up free!  I have spent countless dollars on creams
that are $120 and had countless peels and microdermabrasion, and I swear this
line works better that anything else I’ve tried.  I love it.” -Nicole



“I have been
modeling for 7 years and I have been fighting acne since I started.  This is a difficult thing to face each day
when I have to show my face to the world. 
Make-up has always been a part of my daily routine.  I’ve been using Veridatta for 2 months and it
took about a week to see a difference in my skin.  The breakouts slowly stopped and I feel like
my skin can breathe.  I am now more aware
of how I need to keep the layers open so I am wearing less make-up and I am
getting more complements.  I’m psyched.’  -Lauren

“I have a long 'skin story' that involves
incredibly sensitive and acne prone skin. I am post-accutane treatment five
years ago and I have not changed my skin regimen for at least the same amount
of time in fear of triggering acne outbreaks.  

The
Day Repair adds the perfect amount of moisture under my makeup without looking
too 'wet'. The night repair is absolutely decadent and I can't wait until the
day is over just to wash my face and lather it on. Veridatta has really have
created a wonderful product. I have had no sensitivity issues, and now I can
say I have successfully strayed from my skin regimen for the first time in
years without ill effect. This is huge for me. Because of my
experience, I  have also introduced the Night Repair in my aesthetic
practice for my post chemical peel clients with rave reviews. It's the perfect
post treatment cream.”  -Dr. Glenna


“Veridatta is
a collection where you witness all of the products work together,
synergistically throughout the day.  I am
a makeup artist and have been using products all of my life and I have never
seen one line work so effectively.  I
love the eye serum the most as it does not burn my eyes and I notice I do not
have puffiness or dark circles when using it. 
The scrub is not harsh but extremely moisturizing which is unlike any
other scrub I have ever used.  I have
been in love with my skin as soon as I started using Veridatta.” -Anonymous 
“I have been
using Veridatta since the beginning.  I
have seen all of the changes that the products have undergone and I couldn’t be
happier with the final product.  If I
don’t have my night repair with me, I can always tell in the morning and I
swear I’ll never sleep out again.” -Dan

<p><b><b><i><br/></i></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><i>Keep your smile at it's best! </i></b></b></p>
<p>Experts in dental health say that “prevention” is the key for maintaining your beautiful smile. With Toothscan you will be able to identify potential problems even before they become apparent.</p>
<p><b><b><i>For all the family!</i></b></b></p>
<p>Toothscan allows you and your whole family to monitor their dental health on a day to day, weekly, monthly and yearly basis keeping separate logs for all members of the family. It detects changes in your enamel (top layer of your teeth) even before changes are visually apparent. It’s attractive design helps it’s adoption by your children improving their brushing habits via it’s interactive mobile app.</p>
<p><b><b><i>Reduce costs!</i></b></b></p>
<p>It is well known that a perfect smile does not come cheap! Toothscan allows close collaboration between you and your dentist alerting you and your dentist for developing problems. It can even suggest booking appointments so you can treat problems at the earliest stage reducing treatment costs.</p>

<p><b>How Does It Work? - <b>Science behind the magic</b></b></p>
<p>The operation principle of Toothscanis based on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared_spectroscopy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">spectroscopy technology</a>.</p>
<b></b><p>This method is used to measure the frequency of light, electromagnetic or acoustic waves reflected from a surface or a substance. </p>
<p>Toothscan’s emitter generates a powerful light beam which reflects from the surface of the teeth which is then detected by the receiver area. Irregular reflections are measured and interpreted by the software diagnosing areas requiring attention.</p>
<p>Spectroscopy does not require any special treatment to the object being analysed making it ideal for diagnostic use avoiding potential side effects of any additional chemicals.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1059998/files/20141201010324-_.png?1417424604"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Obtained data is synchronised online via your PC, Tablet or Smartphone.</p>
<p>Toothscan uses Bluetooth® technology to pair with your electronic devices.</p>
<p>Toothscan Software keeps track of personal information giving you real-time feedback. </p>
<p>It will also warn you to change your toothbrush in regular intervals and will be able to recommend a particular toothpaste depending on the composition of your teeth.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Identify problem areas of the teeth at an early stage! </i></b></p>
<p>Dentophobia (Fear of dentist or dental treatment) is a reality and unfortunately not an uncommon one. </p>
<p>Early detection capabilities of the Toothscan will let you know exactly when you need to visit your dentist. Most dental treatments are less costly and possible to prevent progression if detected at an earlier stage. </p>

<p><b>Risk and challenges</b></p>
<p>We have been working on Toothscan for the last year. We created our first working proof-of-concept and now perfecting it. </p>
<p>The main challenges we are facing now are making the prototype as small as a toothbrush and software development with complicated algorithms.   </p>
<p>The next challenge we would face is the process of taking device into mass production. We believe that we would able to minimize those risks by working with the top professionals in order to deliver Toothscan to our backers with full satisfaction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Based on our plan, Toothscan will be able to support more smart devices such as Apple Watch in the future. The exact dates have yet to be officially set. </p>
<p>We will start shipping out early-bird orders from early November. Usually it takes less than a week for the carrier to deliver the product.  The actual time for you to receive your Toothscan is contingent to air and local traffic. Custom delays and extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<br/><b><div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;""><b><b>FAQ</b></b></b><br/>
</div></b><p><b>Is Toothscan eye and skin safe safe?</b></p>
<p>Yes, Toothscan is eye-safe. The technology meets IEC/EN 62471 standard for eye and skin safety operation.</p>
<p><b>How does Toothscan communicate wirelessly to my smartphone?</b></p>
<p>Toothscanhas a fast speed Bluetooth module component that allows wireless communication with your smartphone. </p>
<p><b>How long does the battery last?</b></p>
<p>Toothscan could operate for about 5 days of a standard daily use before it needs to be recharged. It comes with a micro-USB charger dock.</p>
<p><b>How long does a scan take?</b></p>
<p>Toothscan could scan each tooth in about a second.</p>
<p><b>How accurate are the results the device gives?</b></p>
<p>When the light beam reflects from the healthy tooth, there is a certain spectrum - we call it the Reference. Any spectrum deviation from the Reference would signal that the molecular structure is changing.</p>
<p>As more often you use Toothscan as more accurate will be results based on the long term statistics. This would enable to monitor dynamics of your teeth health and predict the decease development risk at early stage.</p>
<p><b></b></p>

Thats why it is so important that we can now prevent the decay process from advancing to the stage that drilling and filling become necessary.""Dr. Larry Burnett, DDSToothscan is a beautifully designed and crafted device roughly the size of your regular toothbrush. It uses cutting edge technology to help you maintain your dental heath and acts as an early detection tool for dental problems helping you avoid expensive treatment bills.Toothscan is designed to be used by both dentists and public. It aims to increase diagnostic capability for early detection of dental problems and the collaboration between patient and the dentist. No technology can replace your dentist but Toothscan will allow you to have a better control over your and your families dental health. Mobile applicationThere is an electronic diary that helps to track condition of the teeth that will clearly demonstrate personal mouth hygiene on a daily basis. The device could be connected to a server with a personal account. It will allow monitoring your teeth condition on a daily (or weekly) basis, give you recommendations and advice to assign a prophylactic visit to your dentist before the disease developed. Toothscan would be connected to your personal online account that would store the long term statistics that you could share with your dentist.     

                                     


Toothscan is a dental health network that would link dentists and patients, with automatic molecular analysis tool for early disease risk detection. 

There is a mobile application with server <-> client communication and a virtual avatar of your doctor (with your real dentist behind) that will automatically advice you on which areas you should take attention to when brushing your teeth and give personal recommendations. 
The virtual dentist mobile app will remind to clean teeth to your kids and provide daily or weekly advice, for instance if you need to eat more fruits & veg in order to restore minerals balance, like calcium etc. 

Toothscan user could personalize settings for the most comfortable use.

Why Toothscan?
It will revolutionize the dentist and client relationship by enabling new visualization of the condition of the clients teeth in realtime and on mobile.

Keep your smile at it's best! 
Experts in dental health say that “prevention” is the key for maintaining your beautiful smile. With Toothscan you will be able to identify potential problems even before they become apparent.
For all the family!
Toothscan allows you and your whole family to monitor their dental health on a day to day, weekly, monthly and yearly basis keeping separate logs for all members of the family. It detects changes in your enamel (top layer of your teeth) even before changes are visually apparent. It’s attractive design helps it’s adoption by your children improving their brushing habits via it’s interactive mobile app.
Reduce costs!
It is well known that a perfect smile does not come cheap! Toothscan allows close collaboration between you and your dentist alerting you and your dentist for developing problems. It can even suggest booking appointments so you can treat problems at the earliest stage reducing treatment costs.
Toothscan is an ambassador of your dentist in your home!




By tracking the condition of your teeth on a daily or weekly basis with an electronic diary, tracking graph and real-time information at your fingertips, you will be able to optimise your and your family’s oral hygiene.  The more you use Toothscan the better prediction you will get.
Toothscan will alert you areas that you are treating less efficiently when brushing your teeth allowing you to change your habits for a better dental health. 
 

How Does It Work? - Science behind the magic
The operation principle of Toothscanis based on the spectroscopy technology.
This method is used to measure the frequency of light, electromagnetic or acoustic waves reflected from a surface or a substance. 
Toothscan’s emitter generates a powerful light beam which reflects from the surface of the teeth which is then detected by the receiver area. Irregular reflections are measured and interpreted by the software diagnosing areas requiring attention.
Spectroscopy does not require any special treatment to the object being analysed making it ideal for diagnostic use avoiding potential side effects of any additional chemicals.

Obtained data is synchronised online via your PC, Tablet or Smartphone.
Toothscan uses Bluetooth® technology to pair with your electronic devices.
Toothscan Software keeps track of personal information giving you real-time feedback. 
It will also warn you to change your toothbrush in regular intervals and will be able to recommend a particular toothpaste depending on the composition of your teeth.


Identify problem areas of the teeth at an early stage! 
Dentophobia (Fear of dentist or dental treatment) is a reality and unfortunately not an uncommon one. 
Early detection capabilities of the Toothscan will let you know exactly when you need to visit your dentist. Most dental treatments are less costly and possible to prevent progression if detected at an earlier stage.

UPDATING...


Risk and challenges
We have been working on Toothscan for the last year. We created our first working proof-of-concept and now perfecting it. 
The main challenges we are facing now are making the prototype as small as a toothbrush and software development with complicated algorithms.   
The next challenge we would face is the process of taking device into mass production. We believe that we would able to minimize those risks by working with the top professionals in order to deliver Toothscan to our backers with full satisfaction.

Based on our plan, Toothscan will be able to support more smart devices such as Apple Watch in the future. The exact dates have yet to be officially set. 
We will start shipping out early-bird orders from early November. Usually it takes less than a week for the carrier to deliver the product.  The actual time for you to receive your Toothscan is contingent to air and local traffic. Custom delays and extraordinary circumstances.

FAQ
Is Toothscan eye and skin safe safe?
Yes, Toothscan is eye-safe. The technology meets IEC/EN 62471 standard for eye and skin safety operation.
How does Toothscan communicate wirelessly to my smartphone?
Toothscanhas a fast speed Bluetooth module component that allows wireless communication with your smartphone. 
How long does the battery last?
Toothscan could operate for about 5 days of a standard daily use before it needs to be recharged. It comes with a micro-USB charger dock.
How long does a scan take?
Toothscan could scan each tooth in about a second.
How accurate are the results the device gives?
When the light beam reflects from the healthy tooth, there is a certain spectrum - we call it the Reference. Any spectrum deviation from the Reference would signal that the molecular structure is changing.
As more often you use Toothscan as more accurate will be results based on the long term statistics. This would enable to monitor dynamics of your teeth health and predict the decease development risk at early stage.

Are you sure you can embed all electronics into the stick form? Flexible PCBs are extremely difficult to effectively use.
We design PCBs ourselves and our engineers made it longer and slim to fit in the shape of the stick. There is no need for flexible PCB.
If I contribute for the Early bird, will I get a beta or final device?
Early bird device for beta testing is fully functional at the near-final stage. Once we complete the clinical trials there would be improvements done according to the beta testing results. Early bird backers would be able to get the final product at 50% discounted price.
Why do I need to buy the Nozzles Pack? How many nozzles are included by default.
For hygienic purposes. You could get one Toothscan device with changeable nozzles and multiple accounts for every member of your family - you buy one Toothscan device and give a nozzle to each member of your family. This might cause a queue in your bathroom though, but this is the most affordable option for a big family.
If you buy an individual Toothscan device for each member of your family it will give you more flexibility of using an individual scanner and use it at any time and take away with you whenever your need it.
Dentist professionals would be able to use disposable nozzles with one Toothscan device for multiple patients.

What is the warranty period?
Toothscan is provided with a 12-month limited warranty.

<p>This campaign is raising money specifically for that surgery.  It's looking like it'll cost about $15,000 US. That's mostly thanks to the fact that my insurance doesn't cover any of it.  I'm going through the U of M health center, and they're all wonderful people, but they can't make it any cheaper.  I have $2,000 saved up, but it certainly won't carry me all the way.</p>
<p>Your donation would mean the world to me, and to a lot of others.  Setting a precedent for this kind of surgery and saying ""we want this, there is a market for this, make this standardized"" will do nothing but good as far as the trans and nonbinary communities are concerned.  This is something that i desperately need, but can't get access to.  This could alleviate some of my depression and anxiety, lowering my dosage of medicine, which would lower my bills.  I urge you to find it somewhere in your heart to help me in this time.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>As I mentioned above, I'm gonna need about $15,000 US to cover the surgery and post-surgery checkups.  I'll be going through the University of Michigan Transgender Health Clinic, and their experienced surgeons are ones I can trust to do a good job and heal me up the quickest, minimizing after-costs.</p>
<p>I've put in a few perks because I love perks and I know tons of other people do.  As I've said, I can't really afford to spend money on most of these, but please remember that I love each and every one of you that helps me out, whether you donate or share this campaign or both.  Any perks will be executed (meaning letters will take up to a week) either once the campaign ends or after the surgery, depending on how the timing goes.  I'll post updates on this page after that point is reached.</p>

<p><b>Why combine coconut water with super greens?</b></p>
<p>When the goodness of coconut water meets the greatness of Super-greens! </p>
<p>We are all no doubt aware of the benefits of these amazing superfood in fact the idea came from the fact that these are the 1<sup>st</sup> things that we add to our fresh smoothies.  We realized quickly that no one had actually done this in a convenience of a powder.  We have brought you a product that works naturally to<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> assist the body to hydrate, detox, </span>energize<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and defend.  It also makes the taste great so it just makes sense don't you think?</span></p>
<p><b>Some super greens powders have more ingredients how did you chose the ingredients to put in Coconut Greens? Why not more?</b></p>
<p>In deciding on the final recipe for Coconut Greens we had some non negotiables. It needed to be organic and the consumer needs to understand what each ingredient does.  Too many supplements contain massive ingredient lists that the average consider has no idea what they do, so if you don't recognize an ingredient why would take it?  More is definitely not better often the quantities of each ingredients are of such low concentrations why bother and some ingredients should be carefully considered. </p>

</div></div>","Hey thanks for checking out Dose4Dose Coconut Greens!
We started just over two years ago while co-founder Geoff was training for his 3rd Ironman triathlon and looking to fuel his body for the gruelling schedule of 15 -20 hours of training a week. Diet alone wasn't cutting it and the early morning green smoothie became a ritual the only thing was we didn't have time to chop bunches of kale at 5am.  
So we started our quest to make the #worldseasiestgreensmoothie.  We started blending superfood powders with our favourite smoothie recipes and now here we are ready to take Coconut Greens from our kitchen to commercial production in the USA, for sale in the USA, Australia and the world. 
Campaign ended please head to www.coconutgreens.com to purchase.
 
 

We have combined coconut water with 9 of the best green superfoods (algaes, grasses, leafy vegetables) on the planet to create the most amazing nutrition rich organic superfood powder with one goal to give you the worlds easiest green smoothie
While researching Coconut Greens we were impacted by the life threatening vitamin A shortage for kids in the developing world and decided that we would donate 5 years Vitamin with every sale which reduces the risk of death by 23%.
 Dose 4 Dose is a mission based social enterprise set up to bring the highest quality organic superfoods and dietary supplements to the market with the added benefit that we match customers purchases Dose 4 Dose with 5 years vitamin A for at risk children around the world.  
Our mission statement - Your Good Health Helping others
 Our aim is to eventually provide 10,000 children with lifesaving vitamin A in the next two years.  For this we need your help to launch!


 
Our campaign is the pre-sales launch of  Dose4dose Coconut Greens all the research work is done and we have already put down half of the opening order cost and we would like your help to fund the half of the first production run. 
We are really passionate about your health and the health of those less fortunate and we believe you'll want to be a part of that!  
Coconut Greens will help you feel good and Dose 4 Dose will help you do good :)
 
Our goal $10,000
So we have so far put in around $8,000 in research costs, trademarks, registrations etc and $20,000 toward our opening order and we seek $10,000 take delivery and start shipping debt free.  We will launch regardless of the outcome of this campaign so contribute with confidence even the smallest contributions will help us.
 

Coconut Greens is simply the world's easiest green smoothie.  It's a powder that you add to your smoothie mix or plain water.  

Our vision for Coconut Greens was to create a product that could:
 
 Hydrate - Natures isotonic packed with magnesium, calcium, sodium and        potassium to balance your body's fluids
 Detox - Gently cleanses the body and removes environmental toxins
 Energize - Bursting with antioxidants such as B group vitamins 
 Defend - Supports the body's natural immunity to fight infections
 
 
It's 100% organic and 100% taste!


 
Label readers take note we know the 1st thing you do is turn the product over to check what's in it I know we do, so we are going to put the ingredients on the front panel and change the game!
 
(This is not the final label and is indicative only we still need to finalise this from a final product specifications which may vary slightly as we scale up production and also need legal and compliance sign off)

More details on the ingredients can be found in our ""Top questions"" list below.
 

What do we donate? Vitamin A via our charity partner Vitamin Angels, we donate 5 years worth for one child from every sale.
Why do we care about Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) ? VAD causes 250,000 to 500,000 children to become blind every year with 50% dying within 12 months of losing their sight.
Who is at risk of  VAD? Children and pregnant women in over 50% of worlds countries, this problem is huge and its solvable.
How does it help? For deficient children Vitamin A supplementation for the first 5 years of life reduces their risk of death by 23%!
Our goal is to donate 5 years vitamin to 10,000 children over the next 2 years!

How do I use Coconut Greens?
 
   What vitamins and minerals can you get from Coconut Greens?
Well we thought a picture can tell a thousand words well word art can too!


Why combine coconut water with super greens?
When the goodness of coconut water meets the greatness of Super-greens! 
We are all no doubt aware of the benefits of these amazing superfood in fact the idea came from the fact that these are the 1st things that we add to our fresh smoothies.  We realized quickly that no one had actually done this in a convenience of a powder.  We have brought you a product that works naturally to assist the body to hydrate, detox, energize and defend.  It also makes the taste great so it just makes sense don't you think?
Some super greens powders have more ingredients how did you chose the ingredients to put in Coconut Greens? Why not more?
In deciding on the final recipe for Coconut Greens we had some non negotiables. It needed to be organic and the consumer needs to understand what each ingredient does.  Too many supplements contain massive ingredient lists that the average consider has no idea what they do, so if you don't recognize an ingredient why would take it?  More is definitely not better often the quantities of each ingredients are of such low concentrations why bother and some ingredients should be carefully considered. 
For a great example of this read the following article on rice bran powder.  http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Research/Rice-bran-contains-high-arsenic-levels-study
Where is Coconut Greens made?
 
Coconut Greens will be made at a FDA and TGA accredited facility in the USA from the best locally and internationally sourced organic ingredients.  For your peace of mind, our carefully chosen manufacturing partner in Long Island NY holds the following accreditations and affiliations:
 
 
          
 

Geoff and Jo on site with our food scientist perfecting the blend.

 How many calories in a dose of Coconut Greens?
If taken with water Coconut Greens is very low in calories. This makes it perfect to support an intermittent fasting diet such as the 5:2 diet.
Do you have a children's dose?
 
For children aged 8 – 12 years, we recommend a half dose of Coconut Greens.  For children under this age please consult with a health care professional to assess your child's individual requirements.
Can Coconut Greens be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding?
Please consult with a health care professional whilst pregnant or lactating.

<p></p><b><h3>Introduction </h3></b><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine a world where Cancer was
no longer feared as a death-sentence, but accepted as a normal, treatable
disease. One where the Patient could expect to recover and continue to live
their normal life, without the harsh side effects or debilitating consequences
so common with current treatments. </p>
<p>TBL-12 offers this kind of hope.
TBL-12 is a Natural Product, without any Chemicals or Preservatives. TBL-12 has
been used for decades, without adverse side effects, and has been used by hundreds
of people with many different forms of Cancer and Leukemia.</p>
<p>Now TBL-12 has been granted Orphan
Drug Designation for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma (Bone Cancer) and we are
ready to apply for our FDA Marketing Approval, in order to make it available to
the mass market.</p>
<p></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p><h3><b><b>Background Information</b></b></h3><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>Cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States and the number of cancer deaths is growing.<div>
<br/><p>This year approximately 550,000
Americans are expected to die of cancer. That’s more than 1500 people a day,
and another 1.3 million will be newly diagnosed. In the USA about one in four
deaths is a result of cancer, and about 70% of all Cancers are diagnosed at 55
and older. <i>(American
Cancer Society, Cancer Facts and Figures 2003).</i></p>
<p>We are all aware that conventional
modalities including chemotherapy and radiation has not faired too well over
the last 4 – 5 decades. According to an analysis published in “Current Cancer
Research”, chemo is credited with remission in only 7% of cases, and prolonged
survival in another 15%. That means it is basically ineffective 80% of the
time.  Most of us are aware of the concept of chemotherapy, which is to
attack the cancer cells and hope not too many of the healthy cells are killed
along with them. In addition there are the debilitating side effects.
Chemotherapy is basically a palliative treatment.</p>
<p>Until now chemotherapy and
radiation may have been the only options available to a cancer patient, but
this is changing.</p>
<p>Our Company, Unicorn Pacific
Corporation, is a small company who has developed and produced a Natural
Dietary Supplement, used mainly by Cancer and Leukemia Sufferers that has the
ability to change the way Cancer is treated and save the lives and increase the
Quality of Life of Millions of sufferers worldwide. </p>

<p></p>
<p>
</p>

<p><u>Mission</u> – to

drug.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b><b>What we have already done</b></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>TBL-12 has been available for many
years, as a Dietary Supplement.</p>
<p>There are many products out there
that claim miraculous benefits, but it has always been accepted that in order
to develop a product to help Cancer Sufferers, a lot of Medical and Scientific
Research was needed in order to convince the authorities and the market of a
product’s benefit and safety for the Patient. </p>
<p>In 2006 we were lucky enough to
find a Clinical Researcher who was interested in TBL-12. This was because of
results he noticed with several of his Patients. This Researcher was the Head
of the Multiple Myeloma Research arm of St. Vincent’s Cancer Hospital in New
York City. We had to show its Safety and meet other Standards, but in December,
2008 we were granted permission from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to be allowed to begin a Phase II Clinical Trial on TBL-12 for the Treatment of
Multiple Myeloma (Bone Cancer).</p>
<p>In 2010, our Trial was moved to
two new locations, one at Mount Sinai Hospital under the control of the
original Researcher, and the other was at New York University, Cancer Center,
under the control of the original Principal Investigator. Both of these Studies
have been completed, but have not been fully documented and Finalized, but
enough data was available, showing positive advantages, for an Application to
be submitted to the FDA to have the product designated an Orphan Drug for the
treatment of Multiple Myeloma (Bone Cancer). The application was submitted on
the 12th of March, 2012 and was approved by the FDA on the 14th May, 2012.</p>

<p>TBL-12 is the first Natural
Product to be granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for any form of Cancer
Treatment.</p>
<p>Many people with a wide variety of
Cancers, not just Multiple Myeloma, have used TBL-12.</p>

<p>TBL-12 is an Immune Modulator and
works on any Immune Related condition. One of the main benefits of TBL-12 is that
unlike <u>all</u> conventional Cancer treatments, TBL-12 has no side-effects and does not interact with other Drugs and Medications, thereby increasing the ""Quality of Life"" of Patients, something that is very rare for Cancer Sufferers.</p>

<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b><b>What we need to do now</b></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In order for Unicorn Pacific to
enter the Multiple Myeloma market as an equal to the established companies
already in the market place, we need to obtain our Marketing Approval through
the FDA.</p>
<p>Though it is relatively simple in
principle, it is expensive in order to meet all the requirements as laid down
by the FDA.</p>
<p><b>Stage 1:   </b>We must complete our current Studies, and have all the documentation
finalized and published in Peer Review Journals, for this we need to raise
approximately US$750,000.00</p>
<p><b>Stage 2:   </b>New Toxicity and Safety Data needs to be established. This is also a
simple matter and just requires Studies to be conducted on TBL-12 in order to
prove the toxicity of the product. We have an existing Study that shows that
TBL-12 is completely non-toxic, but the Marketing Approval requires a New Study
to be conducted showing the latest research. The cost of this stage is relevant
to where the work is done, and who does it. My preference would be to use a USA
Laboratory, as the FDA is always happier to accept US Research Facilities’
findings. The approximate cost of these would be US$2,500,000.00 for the
Toxicity Report and relevant Filings to the FDA.</p>
<p><b>Stage 3: </b> This would entail a Phase III, multi-site Clinical Trial on a minimum
of 300 patients – this costs about US$10,000.00 per patient per year. If fully
enrolled it would cost around US$3,000,000.00 for the first year.</p>
<p><b>Summary of Costs:</b></p>
<p>Stage 1  -  US$ 
750.000.00</p>
<p>Stage 2  - 
US$2,500.000.00</p>
<p>Stage 3  - 
US$3,000.000.00</p>
<p><b>Total    -  US$6,250,000.00</b></p>
<p>The only way we can get our
Marketing Approval is to meet the condition setout by the FDA and prove
Scientifically that TBL-12 is Safe and Effective. This is expensive, but, is
vital, not just for regulatory purposes, but in order to make sure vulnerable
Sufferers are not taken advantage of.</p>
<p>Many products in the market make
outlandish claims that cannot be substantiated scientifically, they cost a lot
of money and give false hope – and most importantly, do not work. If a product
does help, if it has benefits, it is important that it goes through the correct
procedures and meets all the regulations. </p>
<p>While many people will say that these Studies and Trials are obstacles, put in place by Major Companies and the FDA to keep little Companies out of the Market, the truth is, that they give Patients confidence, and assurance that they are using Safe and Effective Treatments. Every ""Real"" Product has to meet these standards, if they don't or can't it is because they are not good products.</p>
<p>This is why we are we are continuing the research with
TBL-12, we know it works, it has been proven, now, we must meet our other obligations, not just to the FDA, but to the millions of sufferers who need TBL-12, and want the confidence that will come with Full FDA Approval.</p>
<p>Already we have done Phase II
Clinical Studies at reputable research facilities, we have scientifically
proven the benefits and safety of TBL-12, and we now need to get our Marketing
Approval from the FDA.</p>
<p>This why we need your help. Your
help will not only give us the Funds for the next stage, but will allow us to
keep TBL-12 at a reasonable price for the consumers. By helping us with the
Funding, we will not need to increase our prices to help recoup our costs, as
is done by the major Drug Companies. We will be able to continue with our
current price, allowing us to offer a Fully Approved Natural Product for the
Treatment of Cancer at prices much lower than conventional Drugs, thereby being
able to help many more people, and reducing the cost burden for everyone, the individual,
the Government and the Health Care Providers.</p>
<p>TBL-12 is the first Natural
Product to be granted Orphan Drug Designation for the Treatment of any Cancer. With
your help, we will become the First Natural Product to be FDA Approved for
Marketing for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma (Bone Cancer) and eventually
many other Cancers.</p>

<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p>
<h3><b><b><b>Summary</b></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have shown through anecdotal
results from customers who have used TBL-12 over the years, and now, through
scientific research conducted at leading, world-class facilities, that this
product has the potential to become a leading Cancer Treatment for not only
Multiple Myeloma, but many other Cancers as well.</p>
<p>Cancer is a devastating disease,
and one that affects many people, more than we realize. Now there is a real
opportunity to be a part of a real solution to this disease, one that not only
helps these people survive and live longer, but lets them survive with Quality

Storm Mountain Sanctuary Retreat Center, LLC is a project dedicated to making mind-body wellness retreats more accessible. Through your support, Storm Mountain Sanctuary will be able to:
Reach out to underserved populations.
Provide skills and resources to those with unique physical and mental health needs.
Provide a sanctuary to those who have been unable to find relief through traditional medical treatments.
Foster love, compassion, healing, and wellness in our communities.

Located on over 5 beautiful acres of mountain property in the heart of Roosevelt National Forest, Storm Mountain Sanctuary is a nurturing and grounding environment, where guests can embark on a profound path toward wellness and balance. More information on the Sanctuary can be found here: http://www.stormmountainsanctuary.com




Why is the Sanctuary Crowdfunding?
In order to provide quality holistic care to those who need it, regardless of their financial means, Storm Mountain Sanctuary needs some initial capital to get the project going. We have set a goal of raising at least $20,000. 

The first 50% of net contributions from this crowdfunding campaign will go toward scholarships for those with limited financial means. (""Net contributions"" means contributions received minus actual incurred costs of the crowdfunding campaign). 
The other 50% of net contributions will go to property costs (including improvement and maintenance), equipment acquisition, retreat supplies, advertising, and outreach.

<p>I volunteered
at the Tianjin orphanage during my one year stay in Tianjin, China. I only
spent a few hours with the kids every week but they gave me back so much more:

most heartwarming moment that I have experienced in my life. Coming from a
country in the world where state welfare is taken for granted I also
experienced that this is not the case in every country of the world. Every week
I saw new orphans coming in but I also had to deal with the reality that a lot
of the children had serious disabilities like heart conditions which needed
surgery but were unlikely to be given this opportunity due to a lack of funds. But
it is not only the expensive surgical interventions that some of the orphans
need, it is also basic things like proper nutrition, formula, orthopedic shoes
or medical devices for the clinic in the orphanage, that are expensive and
can’t all be covered by the orphanage itself. </p>

<p><strong>Once upon a time, there was an old man who used to go to the ocean to do his writing.</strong>He had a habit of walking on the beach every morning before he began his work. Early one morning, he was walking along the shore after a big storm had passed and found the vast beach littered with starfish as far as the eye could see, stretching in both directions. </p>
<p>Off in the distance, the old man noticed a small boy approaching.  As the boy walked, he paused every so often and as he grew closer, the man could see that he was occasionally bending down to pick up an object and throw it into the sea. The boy came closer still and the man called out, “Good morning!  May I ask what it is that you are doing?”</p>
<p>The young boy paused, looked up, and replied “Throwing starfish into the ocean. The tide has washed them up onto the beach and they can’t return to the sea by themselves,” the youth replied. “When the sun gets high, they will die, unless I throw them back into the water.”</p>
<p>The old man replied, “But there must be tens of thousands of starfish on this beach. I’m afraid you won’t really be able to make much of a difference.”</p>

Life on the Border walked him through his countries free medical care system and he was able to get on a 1 year waiting list for surgery. Life on the Border provided medications, in the form of injections, each month so that he could make it one year. Antonio is home now and healing. He went quickly from a wheelchair to a cane and is now out selling again for his business. ONE LIFE MAKES A DIFFERENCE!    Risks & Challenges  We have built a name, in the community, that can be trusted. We build relationships and join resources. We are capable of surmounting the challenges that the border brings so that we may reach people who are in desperate need.   Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Most water filters remove only one kind of particulate. MUV not only removes 99.999% of viruses and bacteria, but also allows you to change the filter modules for your specific water needs. If you are getting water from your tap at home in North America, you don’t need to be concerned about viruses being in your water. What you may find in your tap water is chlorine and metals. In this case you don’t need to use the MUV 3 module that removes viruses, or the MUV 2 that removes bacteria, but you would want to use the MUV 1 module that removes chemicals and metals. </p>

<p><strong>Activated Carbon Fiber - MUV 1 Module</strong></p>
<p>Unlike traditional activated carbon in powder or granular form, Activated Carbon Fiber is a fibrous adsorbent that has 10x higher adsorption than traditional activated carbon and gives you faster flow rates.</p>
<p>Activated Carbon Fiber can remove:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chemicals</li>
<li>Heavy metals</li>
<li>Discoloration of water</li>
<li>Negative taste</li>
<li>Filters up to 150 gallons</li>

<p><strong>Hollow Fiber - MUV 2 Module</strong>    </p>
<p>Hollow Fiber membrane are tiny hollow tubes that look like straws. These fibers have a porous membrane wall that allows clean water into the fiber and prohibits contaminants from passing through the membrane. Hollow Fiber membranes filter water by size exclusion. Size exclusion works by having a pore size smaller than the size of the contaminants. Clean water is allowed to go through the membrane while large contaminants cannot fit through the pores.</p>
<p>Hollow Fiber can remove:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bacteria (E. Coli, Cholera, Typhoid, etc) </li>
<li>Protozoa (Cryptosporidium) </li>
<li>Parasites (Giardia)</li>
<li>Filters up to 100,000 gallons</li>

<p><strong>Nanalum - MUV 3 Module</strong>    </p>
<p>The technology used in Nanalum was developed by NASA as a way to reuse waste water on the International Space Station. Nanalum works through electro-absorption and is manufactured with non-woven highly engineered water filter paper which is also impregnated with Granular Activated Carbon (GAC). The Nanalum module has a strong positive electrostatic charge when wet. Like a strong magnet, the positive electrostatic charge of the Nanalum attracts and traps organic contaminants..</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>We have completed all the sourcing of materials, and are 90% done with the final design. Our molds and tooling have already been designed and are awaiting production.</p>
<p>The big hurdle is finalizing testing and certification. However, since our sourcing partners complete internal testing procedures we are confident in a fluid certification process.

<h3><span>Why use Sunu Band</span></h3>
<p>With Sunu band you will own your environments. You can detect and locate obstacles up to 13 feet away, find thresholds or openings to walk through, follow or avoid people around you with precision and feel what's around you without physical contact. With Sunu you navigate in a simple, smooth and secure way. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sbcqL77lE6nv_sdlmpHWxFtfrpQN0t_alQ_sqNQmE_wORwxyTXnAFb8faUP8YPqAyYPo5gyswcs3O1NNtTbxAIi_DY7-gayrSNMRHhYtdBNZzKuvSLTKg7W31-GC6FKBYTMvtNn6"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Sunu band is optimized with two different operation modes, for indoor and outdoor scenarios. The Indoor mode has a shorter range (8 feet) and is enhanced to detect <b>openings</b> and <b>thresholds</b>, like aisles in a supermarket, exits in a building, spaces between people and so on. The outdoor mode has a longer range (13 feet) and covers a wider area allowing you to detect obstacles above the knees up to <b>head level</b>, like trash cans, phone box, hanging tree branches, etc. </p>
<p>Thanks to its ergonomic design, the Sunu Band can be pointed with minimal movements from your hand, enabling you to feel your surroundings in a very <b>discreet </b>and <b>quick </b>manner. Sunu Band doesn’t interfere with the other senses because it provides vibration feedback, and it's non-obtrusive as you still maintain free use of your hand.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Sunu Band uses an ultrasound transducer as a proximity sensor. The ultrasonic wave emitted from the transducer bounces back from objects that are within the sensor's path and direction. The resulting 'echo' is detected by the same sensor, and then is processed and converted into vibrations pulses. This pulses become more frequent as the obstacle gets closer.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GUwQRTEkfzYWvd4g51xbQ2l6Jgj9pLY61f70g9MReyfMQV-Npiy2ornK1IygtkQXv9e0sBi_yCXdJiS5qbMhAHJTRT1KvIcwE2hVlGYRndAP3K9pBON2nHynNtYsZZoBFtuun28J"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Sunu band also has an embedded 3 axis accelerometer that is sensing inclination to modulate the emitting ultrasonic wave. This allows the device to automatically adjust the range while pointing upwards, so it doesn’t detect obstacles way above head level (like ceiling lamps, fans or the ceiling itself) and only detect obstacles that can be a thread to the user.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>How does the Sunu Tag work? </h3>
<p>Sunu Tag is a low-power 'beacon' that can be clipped to any personal belonging such as keys, backpacks, luggage, to keep track of it and locate it in case it gets lost. Sunu Tags can be activated via Bluetooth from the Sunu Band or your smartphone within a 30 feet range of the tagged article. When activated, the phone or the band increasing pulses indicate the Tag’s proximity and the Sunu Tag 'chirps'  allowing the user to readily find the item.</p>

The Sunu App works for Android and iOS (Soon for Android) and doesn’t need the Sunu Band to work.</p>

Both inventors, Marco Trujillo and Cuauhtli Padilla brought the first Sunu prototype as a way promote play with the children and something almost magical happened. The first group of kids using the sonar-bracelet began solving makeshift mazes and playing a variety of games.

<h3> ¿Por qué usar Sunu band?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>Con Sunu Band serás dueño de tu entorno. Puedes detectar y localizar obstáculos con hasta casi 5 metros de distancia, encontrar aberturas o caminos despejados, seguir o evitar con precisión a la gente que te rodea, y sentir lo que hay a tus alrededores sin tener un contacto físico. Con Sunu puedes navegar de una manera simple, fluida y segura.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sbcqL77lE6nv_sdlmpHWxFtfrpQN0t_alQ_sqNQmE_wORwxyTXnAFb8faUP8YPqAyYPo5gyswcs3O1NNtTbxAIi_DY7-gayrSNMRHhYtdBNZzKuvSLTKg7W31-GC6FKBYTMvtNn6"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Sunu Band está optimizado con dos modos de operación, para escenarios interiores y exteriores. El modo de interiores tiene un rango corto de detección (2.5 mts) y está mejorado para detectar <b>aberturas </b>y <b>huecos</b>, como pasillos en supermercados, salidas en un edificio, espacio entre las personas, entre otras cosas. El modo de exteriores tiene un mayor rango de detección (4.5 metros) y cubre un área más amplia, permitiéndote detectar obstáculos desde el nivel de las rodillas hasta el <b>nivel de la cabeza</b>, como botes de basura, casetas de teléfono, ramas de árboles, etcétera. </p>
<br/>Gracias a su diseño ergonómico, Sunu Band puede ser direccionado con mínimos movimientos de tu muñeca, permitiendote sentir tu entorno de una forma muy <b>discreta </b>y <b>rápida</b>. Sunu Band no interfiere con tus otros sentidos ya que provee una retroalimentación en forma de vibración, y no es invasivo ya que sigues manteniendo libre uso de tu mano. <p></p>

<h3>¿Cómo funciona Sunu band?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>Sunu Band usa un transductor de ultrasonido como sensor de proximidad. La onda de ultrasonido emitida desde el transductor rebota de regreso en los objetos que se encuentran en el camino y dirección del sensor. El “eco” generado es detectado por el mismo sensor, y luego procesado y convertido en vibraciones. Estas vibraciones aumentan su frecuencia mientras más cerca esté el obstáculo. <p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GUwQRTEkfzYWvd4g51xbQ2l6Jgj9pLY61f70g9MReyfMQV-Npiy2ornK1IygtkQXv9e0sBi_yCXdJiS5qbMhAHJTRT1KvIcwE2hVlGYRndAP3K9pBON2nHynNtYsZZoBFtuun28J"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Sunu band también tiene integrado un acelerómetro de 3 ejes que permite sensar la inclinación de la pulsera y así modular, de forma automática, la onda de ultrasonido. Esto permite que se reduzca el rango automáticamente cuando se apunta hacia arriba para solo detectar obstáculos que puedan ser una amenaza a la cabeza y no obstáculos que estén muy arriba para ser una amenaza (Como lámparas, el techo, etc).</p>
<h3><br/></h3>

<p></p>
<h3>¿Cómo funciona Sunu Tag?</h3>
<p></p>El Sunu Tag es un “localizador” de larga duración que puede ser enganchado a cualquier objeto personal como las llaves, mochilas o  maletas, para localizarlas en caso de que se pierdan. Los Sunu Tags pueden ser activados vía Bluetooth desde la Sunu Band o desde tu celular en un rango de 10 metros. Cuando es activado, el teléfono o la pulsera aumentarán sus vibraciones indicando la proximidad al Tag y el Tag a su vez emitirá una alarma, para encontrarlo fácilmente. <p></p>

<h3>Acerca de Sunu<br/>
</h3>Nuestra misión es empoderar la movilidad e independencia de las personas con discapacidad visual. Nuestra visión es el crear tecnología wearable que utilice el mejor diseño, que permita y aumente los sentidos en una forma discreta e intuitiva.<p></p>
<br/>Sunu comenzó como un proyecto de servicio social en la escuela Helen Keller de Guadalajara, México. Los niños de la escuela raramente jugaban en el patio de recreo y solo salían una vez a la semana para tener sus clases de movilidad. Ambos inventores, Marco Trujillo y Cuauhtli Padilla crearon el primer prototipo de Sunu con el objetivo de promover el juego de los niños, y algo casi mágico sucedió.  El primer grupo de niños usando la pulsera comenzó a jugar y resolver rápidamente laberintos con obstáculos creados por el equipo. Los padres de familia, niños y maestros inspiraron a Marco y Cuauhtli a llevar este prototipo al siguiente nivel.<br/><br/><b><h3><br/></h3>

At Sunu we believe that human willpower is capable of overcoming any limitation, so we boost it using the best of technology and design. Our first product, the Sunu Band, is an inclusive smart-bracelet along with an object tracker that empowers mobility and independence for the visually impaired.









Sunu band is the first smart band using ultrasonic technology to sense the user’s surroundings and deliver haptic feedback on his wrist to indicate proximity. Sunu band can also give you the time with its discrete vibrational watch feature and can help you find your missing objects with the Sunu Tag; a tiny beacon like device that can be clipped to any personal object (Sunu Tag can also be tracked from your smartphone in case you don’t have the band).


Our campaign’s mission is to generate impact in the lives of people living with impaired vision. Every time a contributor gets a perk, all the extra funding received will go towards our donation policy; For every $99 dollars collected from contributions, we will donate a Sunu Band to a child (in our organization partners list) living in a developing country. Thanks to our partnership with Sinec Technologies (Manufacturing partner), we are capable of delivering your Perk Rewards regardless if we reach our goal.  




School for blind children in Guadalajara, Mexico




Sunu in the Press


You can find our story published on various outlets in the US and Latin America. Recent interviews include CNN Latino, Ocho TV and the MIT Technology Review. Sunu Band has been featured on the Perkins and the National Federation of the Blind technology blogs.




Why use Sunu Band
With Sunu band you will own your environments. You can detect and locate obstacles up to 13 feet away, find thresholds or openings to walk through, follow or avoid people around you with precision and feel what's around you without physical contact. With Sunu you navigate in a simple, smooth and secure way. 

Sunu band is optimized with two different operation modes, for indoor and outdoor scenarios. The Indoor mode has a shorter range (8 feet) and is enhanced to detect openings and thresholds, like aisles in a supermarket, exits in a building, spaces between people and so on. The outdoor mode has a longer range (13 feet) and covers a wider area allowing you to detect obstacles above the knees up to head level, like trash cans, phone box, hanging tree branches, etc. 
Thanks to its ergonomic design, the Sunu Band can be pointed with minimal movements from your hand, enabling you to feel your surroundings in a very discreet and quick manner. Sunu Band doesn’t interfere with the other senses because it provides vibration feedback, and it's non-obtrusive as you still maintain free use of your hand.

Sunu Band is truly augmentative as it can be used alongside other mobility aids, like the white cane or with a guide dog. Its sonar transducer emits at a frequency that is safe around dogs and other pets. Besides, getting started is very easy, thanks to our skills-based guides, developed in partnership with Orientation and Mobility specialists. 






More features 

Gesture Control - Allows you to quickly manipulate all the band functions with one hand using simple hand gestures. 
Vibration Clock - Keep track of time with Sunu's haptic clock. Vibrations discreetly tell you the time with a simple abacus like system.
Sunu Tag - Find your personal articles with this tiny tracker. Vibrations on the band or your smartphone indicate the Tag’s proximity while an alarm on the Tag helps you to find it quickly.
Smartphone connectivity - customize the settings on the band, set up alarms and sync the time with the connected Sunu App.






What do Testers say?
Sunu We have try the device with over a 100 users, modify its design and features over 10 different times and after all this hard work we are very proud of the product we have come up to. Check out some of the testimonies from our testers.




How does Sunu Band work?


Sunu Band uses an ultrasound transducer as a proximity sensor. The ultrasonic wave emitted from the transducer bounces back from objects that are within the sensor's path and direction. The resulting 'echo' is detected by the same sensor, and then is processed and converted into vibrations pulses. This pulses become more frequent as the obstacle gets closer.

Sunu band also has an embedded 3 axis accelerometer that is sensing inclination to modulate the emitting ultrasonic wave. This allows the device to automatically adjust the range while pointing upwards, so it doesn’t detect obstacles way above head level (like ceiling lamps, fans or the ceiling itself) and only detect obstacles that can be a thread to the user.

How does the Sunu Tag work? 
Sunu Tag is a low-power 'beacon' that can be clipped to any personal belonging such as keys, backpacks, luggage, to keep track of it and locate it in case it gets lost. Sunu Tags can be activated via Bluetooth from the Sunu Band or your smartphone within a 30 feet range of the tagged article. When activated, the phone or the band increasing pulses indicate the Tag’s proximity and the Sunu Tag 'chirps'  allowing the user to readily find the item.
Mobile Enabled - Sunu Tags can be 'paired up' with either a Sunu Band or your smartphone. The Sunu App works for Android and iOS (Soon for Android) and doesn’t need the Sunu Band to work.

'Move Freely' - is more than just a tagline. It represents our mission to empower independence - to deliver Sunu Band to people living with impaired sight, whether they can afford it, need a little extra help or are living with limited resources. We're partnering with rural schools for blind children and other institutions serving the visually impaired in the developing world . This is where our story began, and for $99, you can gift a Sunu to a  to an organization in our list like the School for Blind Children in Guadalajara, Mexico.




There are various ways in which you can join our mission for as little as $5 to $10. We're excited to offer unique perks at various contribution levels, and we are proudly partnering with Art Lifting - a Boston based startup that empowers disabled and homeless artists through the celebration and sale of their artwork. 
We aim to celebrate inspiring lives and accomplishments from people living with impaired vision. We are very proud to partner with olympic athlete Marla Runyan - world-class American track and field athlete and marathon runner, who is legally blind. From an early age, Marla had Stargardts disease, a macular degeneration that leads to progressive vision loss. Her vision never prevented Marla from pursuing her dreams. Marla won 5 gold medals in the 1992 and 1996 Paralympic games and joined the US Olympic Team in 2000. Now's your chance to connect with US Olympian Marla Runyan. We will be offering special prizes throughout our campaign.


Together, we're helping people move freely. Here is how you can show your support:


Our mission is to empower mobility and independence for the visually impaired. We envision creating wearable technology that employs the best in design, and enables and augments the senses in a way that is discreet and intuitive.



Sunu started out as a community service project at a Helen Keller School for blind children in Guadalajara, Mexico. Children at the school rarely played in the schoolyard and only went out one a week for their mobility lessons. Both inventors, Marco Trujillo and Cuauhtli Padilla brought the first Sunu prototype as a way promote play with the children and something almost magical happened. The first group of kids using the sonar-bracelet began solving makeshift mazes and playing a variety of games. The parents, kids and teachers inspired Marco and Cuauhtli to take this early prototype to the next level.

En Sunu creemos que la fuerza de voluntad es capaz de superar cualquier limitación, es por esto que buscamos impulsarla utilizando lo mejor de la tecnología y el diseño. Nuestro primer producto, Sunu Band, es una pulsera inteligente inclusiva que junto con un localizador de objetos buscan empoderar la movilidad e independencia de las personas con discapacidad visual.





Sunu Band es la primer pulsera inteligente que utiliza tecnología ultrasónica para sensar los alrededores del usuario y entregar retroalimentación háptica en su muñeca para indicar la proximidad. También, puede indicar la hora con su discreto reloj vibratorio y puede ayudar a encontrar objetos perdidos con el Sunu Tag; un pequeño accesorio localizador que puede ser adherido a cualquier objeto personal (El Sunu Tag también puede ser activado desde cualquier celular en el caso de que no se tenga la Sunu Band).


La misión de nuestra campaña es generar un impacto en la vida de personas que viven con discapacidad visual. Cada vez que un una persona hace una contribución, todos los fondos adicionales recibidos se destinarán a nuestra política de donación; Por cada $99 dólares recolectados de las contribuciones, nosotros donaremos una Sunu Band a un niño (de nuestra lista de instituciones asociadas) viviendo en un país en vías de desarrollo. Gracias a nuestra asociación con Sinec Technologies (socio de manufactura), somos capaces de entregar todas las recompensas de las contribuciones sin importar si llegamos a la meta o no.

Sunu en la Prensa

Puedes encontrar nuestra historia publicada en diferentes medios de Estados Unidos y Latino América; entrevistas recientes en CNN Latino, Ocho TV y el MIT Technology Review. Sunu Band ha sido destacado y publicado en los blogs de tecnología de Perkins y el National Federation of the Blind.



 ¿Por qué usar Sunu band?

Con Sunu Band serás dueño de tu entorno. Puedes detectar y localizar obstáculos con hasta casi 5 metros de distancia, encontrar aberturas o caminos despejados, seguir o evitar con precisión a la gente que te rodea, y sentir lo que hay a tus alrededores sin tener un contacto físico. Con Sunu puedes navegar de una manera simple, fluida y segura.

Sunu Band está optimizado con dos modos de operación, para escenarios interiores y exteriores. El modo de interiores tiene un rango corto de detección (2.5 mts) y está mejorado para detectar aberturas y huecos, como pasillos en supermercados, salidas en un edificio, espacio entre las personas, entre otras cosas. El modo de exteriores tiene un mayor rango de detección (4.5 metros) y cubre un área más amplia, permitiéndote detectar obstáculos desde el nivel de las rodillas hasta el nivel de la cabeza, como botes de basura, casetas de teléfono, ramas de árboles, etcétera. 
Gracias a su diseño ergonómico, Sunu Band puede ser direccionado con mínimos movimientos de tu muñeca, permitiendote sentir tu entorno de una forma muy discreta y rápida. Sunu Band no interfiere con tus otros sentidos ya que provee una retroalimentación en forma de vibración, y no es invasivo ya que sigues manteniendo libre uso de tu mano. 

Sunu Band simplemente incrementa, ya que puede ser utilizado con otros dispositivos para la movilidad, como el bastón o un perro guía. Su sensor sonar emite sonido a una frecuencia que es segura para los perros u otras mascotas. Además, comenzar a utilizarlo es muy sencillo gracias a nuestros manuales de uso desarrollados con el apoyo de especialistas en Orientación y Movilidad. 





Más Características



Interfaz de una sola mano - te permite manipular rápidamente todas las funciones de la pulsera con movimientos simples y discretos de tu mano.
Reloj discreto - conoce la hora con el reloj vibratorio de Sunu por medio de sistema de pulsos parecidos al sistema del ábaco. 
Sunu Tag - Encuentra tus objetos personales con este pequeño localizador. Vibraciones en la pulsera o en tu smartphone te indican la proximidad del Tag, mientras que una alarma del Tag te ayuda a encontrarlo fácilmente.
Conectividad con tu Celular - personaliza la configuración de la pulsera, programa alarmas y sincroniza la hora con la conexión a la Sunu App.








¿Cómo funciona Sunu band?

Sunu Band usa un transductor de ultrasonido como sensor de proximidad. La onda de ultrasonido emitida desde el transductor rebota de regreso en los objetos que se encuentran en el camino y dirección del sensor. El “eco” generado es detectado por el mismo sensor, y luego procesado y convertido en vibraciones. Estas vibraciones aumentan su frecuencia mientras más cerca esté el obstáculo. 

Sunu band también tiene integrado un acelerómetro de 3 ejes que permite sensar la inclinación de la pulsera y así modular, de forma automática, la onda de ultrasonido. Esto permite que se reduzca el rango automáticamente cuando se apunta hacia arriba para solo detectar obstáculos que puedan ser una amenaza a la cabeza y no obstáculos que estén muy arriba para ser una amenaza (Como lámparas, el techo, etc).



¿Cómo funciona Sunu Tag?
El Sunu Tag es un “localizador” de larga duración que puede ser enganchado a cualquier objeto personal como las llaves, mochilas o  maletas, para localizarlas en caso de que se pierdan. Los Sunu Tags pueden ser activados vía Bluetooth desde la Sunu Band o desde tu celular en un rango de 10 metros. Cuando es activado, el teléfono o la pulsera aumentarán sus vibraciones indicando la proximidad al Tag y el Tag a su vez emitirá una alarma, para encontrarlo fácilmente. 
Compatible con Celulares - Los Sunu Tags pueden ser “sincronizados” con la Sunu Band o con tu Celular. La Sunu App funciona para iOS (próximamente en Android) y no necesita de la Sunu Band para funcionar.

Acerca de Sunu
Nuestra misión es empoderar la movilidad e independencia de las personas con discapacidad visual. Nuestra visión es el crear tecnología wearable que utilice el mejor diseño, que permita y aumente los sentidos en una forma discreta e intuitiva.
Sunu comenzó como un proyecto de servicio social en la escuela Helen Keller de Guadalajara, México. Los niños de la escuela raramente jugaban en el patio de recreo y solo salían una vez a la semana para tener sus clases de movilidad. Ambos inventores, Marco Trujillo y Cuauhtli Padilla crearon el primer prototipo de Sunu con el objetivo de promover el juego de los niños, y algo casi mágico sucedió.  El primer grupo de niños usando la pulsera comenzó a jugar y resolver rápidamente laberintos con obstáculos creados por el equipo. Los padres de familia, niños y maestros inspiraron a Marco y Cuauhtli a llevar este prototipo al siguiente nivel.

<b>Summary...</b><br/>Medical cannabis is coming to Pennsylvania, and Allegheny Botanicals wants to be the premier processor of cannabis in Pennsylvania.

</div><div>
<div>
<p>Some years ago, I asked myself that same question. I realized that while I had a lot to be thankful for in my life, I was falling short of my own potential. Don’t get me wrong—I was doing the best I could, and life had been trucking along fine. I had moved to a new city on the West Coast, attended university, started to discover myself, landed a great job, fell in love, traveled a little and started a family. But I never seemed to have time for the things that were most important to me. I was also spending more money than I had.</p>
<h4>A balancing act called 'life'</h4>
<p>My health and fitness ebbed and flowed throughout my life. When I only had to worry about myself, I could always find time for fitness. But when other people—my family—became a significant part of my life, I felt pulled to prioritize “us” rather than “me,” and my health often suffered as a result. I figured that this was just the way it went; after all, it seemed like everyone else I knew was on the same path. But in the back of my mind, I was always thinking: Is this really how life is supposed to be?</p>
<p>As time went on, I kept trying to balance the priorities in my life, striving to attain “perfection,” but I was constantly disappointed in myself. I was never able to truly balance it all. When I let one part of my life become the shining star, all other aspects of my life would dim in comparison. If I focused on family, my career suffered. When I turned my energies toward my career, in particular when I was building my company, my family felt it, and so did my health. I just never seemed to have enough to make everything work. Do you know the feeling?</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446152879/qrvc8q7zvuk8dxlzl5in.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Like many people, I found happy distraction in activities that didn’t propel me forward in life—pub nights, boys’ trips, nights out with my colleagues and long days on the golf course. I kept telling myself that tomorrow would be the day to “reset” and get everything in order: Tomorrow is the day to start my new habits. Tomorrow is the start of my path to awesomeness. But you know what? Every day I’d wake up to today and tomorrow would never arrive.</p>
<p>Maybe you can relate. Many of us put all of our obligations— ether it’s work, family, or social life—ahead of our own well-being and personal growth. We’re so busy taking care of what her people need from us that we forget to pay attention to our own needs. The problem with that is that while this might help us to get a lot done, mostly for others, we’re probably not feeling satisfied with our lives. Even worse, if we’re not careful, we can burn out—both mentally and physically. And when that happens, we not only let ourselves down, we also let down who depend on us.</p>
<h4>Why create the Whole Life Fitness Manifesto?</h4>
<p>My goal in creating the Whole Life Fitness Manifesto is to sweep away the negative energies, accentuate the positive ones and empower you to radiate your own awesomeness, along with the greatness of those around you. In a nutshell, the Whole Life Fitness Manifesto is about putting yourself first, which will ultimately benefit those you care about. We all have people in our lives that matter to us. It’s time we begin to matter to ourselves so that we can enjoy an incredible life with each other. So, welcome to a new kind of fitness book. We’re not just talking about physical fitness here. We’re acknowledging that whole-life awesomeness encompasses fitness of mind, body and spirit. And because this is something that we all deserve, this book is for everyone. Even the most stamina-challenged person can tackle the Whole Life Fitness Power 30 program, which will also test you if you are already pushing your own fitness limits.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F138691722&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F138691722&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F534170236_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Getting a grip on total health and wellness is particularly important now because of disturbing rises in obesity and diabetes. Current health statistics, which you’ll find throughout this book, are not pretty. In fact, they are a sobering wake-up call.</p>
<p>But there is reason for hope. On the other end of the spectrum, there is a booming personal growth movement, in which people are realizing their limitless potential as human beings. Put simply, linking your greater potential to your physical fitness is a powerful combination that can change—and possibly save—your life.</p>
<p>As you’ll see, workouts don’t have to be a chore. Working out is really about enjoying a burst of movement that can function as a reset, break, and check-in with your body throughout the day. It’s about feeling how daily movement can activate all kinds of positive things in your life.</p>
<h4>What makes me so certain about all this? </h4>
<p>Let me share a deeply personal story.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, there were two students in my school who were extremely over- weight. I was one of them. As a 91-kg (200-lb) 15-year-old, I had a body mass index (BMI) of over 40; I was, by definition, morbidly obese. But after a big personal break- through shortly after my 15th birthday, I dug deep to make a change and, quite simply, I never looked back. My mental attitude played a pivotal role in making that change. I wanted to be healthy, happy and more satisfied with my life, and I did whatever it took to make that happen.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446228723/jpcj4qok5hbtqyseqrxe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>So what about today?</h4>
<p>Today, I am honored to be part of a healthy and beautiful family, with my wife, Christie, and my daughters, Chardonae and Brielyn. I constantly strive to live a life  of which I’m proud. In my professional life, I’ve evolved from a successful fitness equipment entrepreneur to a personal trainer, lifestyle coach, speaker, author and all-around “life enhancer.” I’m honored to have the ability to help people every day— now that’s pretty awesome!</p>
<p>Beyond my family, physical health and career, one of the most important aspects of my well-being is my mental health, or emotional fitness. I continually strive to cultivate a deep sense of purpose in my heart and mind; this is what makes me spring out of bed in the morning. And at the end of each day, I ask myself: Was I the best person I could possibly be today? If I can answer yes more often than not, then I know I’m on the right track.</p>
<p>I know we are all capable of achieving whole life fitness. That is, while I believe that we can work out on our own, we never have to be alone with our fitness and lifestyle goals. Now that you’ve found this book, you have found your community—your tribe. No matter what your current lifestyle, age, gender or personality, you are not alone. We are here to encourage and support each other to be the happiest, healthiest versions of ourselves.</p>
<p><b>So, hands up if you’re ready for a whole life of awesomeness!</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>

<p><b>PS - a huge thank you to all those that have supported me and my family on this journey. It's been quite the ride and it's only just beginning. Hoorah! </b></p>

My goal in creating the Whole Life Fitness Manifesto is to sweep away the negative energies, accentuate the positive ones and empower you to radiate your own awesomeness, along with the greatness of those around you. In a nutshell, the Whole Life Fitness Manifesto is about putting yourself first, which will ultimately benefit those you care about. We all have people in our lives that matter to us. It’s time we begin to matter to ourselves so that we can enjoy an incredible life with each other. So, welcome to a new kind of fitness book. We’re not just talking about physical fitness here. We’re acknowledging that whole-life awesomeness encompasses fitness of mind, body and spirit. And because this is something that we all deserve, this book is for everyone. Even the most stamina-challenged person can tackle the Whole Life Fitness Power 30 program, which will also test you if you are already pushing your own fitness limits.

Getting a grip on total health and wellness is particularly important now because of disturbing rises in obesity and diabetes. Current health statistics, which you’ll find throughout this book, are not pretty. In fact, they are a sobering wake-up call.
But there is reason for hope. On the other end of the spectrum, there is a booming personal growth movement, in which people are realizing their limitless potential as human beings. Put simply, linking your greater potential to your physical fitness is a powerful combination that can change—and possibly save—your life.
As you’ll see, workouts don’t have to be a chore. Working out is really about enjoying a burst of movement that can function as a reset, break, and check-in with your body throughout the day. It’s about feeling how daily movement can activate all kinds of positive things in your life.
What makes me so certain about all this? 
Let me share a deeply personal story.
When I was a kid, there were two students in my school who were extremely over- weight. I was one of them. As a 91-kg (200-lb) 15-year-old, I had a body mass index (BMI) of over 40; I was, by definition, morbidly obese. But after a big personal break- through shortly after my 15th birthday, I dug deep to make a change and, quite simply, I never looked back. My mental attitude played a pivotal role in making that change. I wanted to be healthy, happy and more satisfied with my life, and I did whatever it took to make that happen.


So what about today?
Today, I am honored to be part of a healthy and beautiful family, with my wife, Christie, and my daughters, Chardonae and Brielyn. I constantly strive to live a life  of which I’m proud. In my professional life, I’ve evolved from a successful fitness equipment entrepreneur to a personal trainer, lifestyle coach, speaker, author and all-around “life enhancer.” I’m honored to have the ability to help people every day— now that’s pretty awesome!
Beyond my family, physical health and career, one of the most important aspects of my well-being is my mental health, or emotional fitness. I continually strive to cultivate a deep sense of purpose in my heart and mind; this is what makes me spring out of bed in the morning. And at the end of each day, I ask myself: Was I the best person I could possibly be today? If I can answer yes more often than not, then I know I’m on the right track.
I know we are all capable of achieving whole life fitness. That is, while I believe that we can work out on our own, we never have to be alone with our fitness and lifestyle goals. Now that you’ve found this book, you have found your community—your tribe. No matter what your current lifestyle, age, gender or personality, you are not alone. We are here to encourage and support each other to be the happiest, healthiest versions of ourselves.
So, hands up if you’re ready for a whole life of awesomeness!


PS - a huge thank you to all those that have supported me and my family on this journey. It's been quite the ride and it's only just beginning. Hoorah!",8.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello and thanks for checking out
V Well Health. We are a passionate team of nutrition and wellness experts with
one goal in mind: to spread hope, health and healing to as many people as
possible. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We’re driven by our co-founder’s
powerful story, where Vicky DeRosa, a blind mother, can see again after
changing her diet and lifestyle habits. Our vision is to create a worldwide
community where people learn to eat better, live healthier and be happier.</p>
<p>Your participation and
contribution can help make this a reality as we develop and launch our Healthier,
Happier You Challenge - health for the body, calm for the mind, and bliss
for the spirit. </p>

still eating healthy, delicious food. We make it easier for you to live a
happier and healthier life with our done-for-you shopping guides, health
coaches, on-demand fitness videos, app integration and daily inspirational
tips. In just 10 weeks, you'll be beach body ready, feeling great, and have a
chance to win $1,000!</p>
<p>Past challenge participants have
lost on average 12 pounds, reduced body fat, increased muscle mass and, perhaps
most importantly, learned about real, authentic health. They don’t go on a diet
for a few weeks - they learn a whole new way of approaching food, activity and
health. Participants leave the challenge looking and feeling better and having
more energy.  </p>

everything we've learned into this new Challenge.</p>

and weight control. </p>
<p>This requires a crack, passionate

quicker.</p>

price of $50 by selecting the ""Join the Challenge"" perk. After April 15, the price will jump back up to $97.</p>

</h1>
<p>My name is Dr. Joseph Dargan. I'm a dentist. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When I ask my patients to start flossing, they say... ""</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">but I do that already!</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">"" </span></p>
<p>You can see the problem! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459343920/yi5xyc8ucgezhx7evhpj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We all know that flossing properly is hard to do. So I invented </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">FlossiO</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, a patented innovative dental flosser that helps you floss properly. It's also the only disposable flosser that can floss the whole mouth with clean floss in one go! </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We believe it's better than the other dental flossers available today, and we think you will too! </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<p>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459086756/yir4yxhy0qmvejxu6rdn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>FlossiO</b> consists of a loop of dental floss held by two finger rings. <b>A unique feature is that the user can easily move to a fresh piece of floss for each tooth without taking the rings off the fingers</b> due to the patented design that allows the floss to move through the rings. Rings that hold floss have been designed before, but they use a fixed section of floss that has to be loaded by the user, and will only floss a few teeth before getting worn. </p>
<p>The best way to floss is using normal dental floss. Used properly, it provides a strong ""blade"" of floss to scrape deposits of tartar from between the teeth. Control,  strength and anchorage is provided by the fingers. Also, the user can move to a fresh section of floss by unwinding the floss off one finger and winding it up on the other. This procedure, however, is difficult, time consuming, requires dexterity, and can hurt the fingers. <b>FlossiO</b> incorporates all the advantages of flossing properly, while eliminating the disadvantages. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Other disposable flossers...</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Are weak and therefore bend when used.</li>
<li>Have only one short length of floss that will transfer bacteria and plaque around the mouth.</li>
<li>Require floss to be attached by the user.</li>
<li>Have heads that come off and get stuck between the teeth.</li>
<li>Are big and bulky and therefore not very portable.</li>
<li>Are shaped in a way that makes access to the back teeth difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>FlossiO has the following advantages</b></p>
<p><b>1. Bacteria are not transferred between teeth.</b></p>
<p><b><b>2. One device will floss the whole mouth hygienically.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>3. Provides more control from the strength and anchorage of the fingers.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>4. Individually wrapped for hygiene and portability. </b></b></p>
<p><b><b>5. No more sore fingers.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>6. No heads that can dislodge and get stuck between teeth. </b></b></p>

</div></div>","Flossing is hard to do...

                                   ...until now!


Do you floss? Maybe. Are you doing it properly? Probably not!

My name is Dr. Joseph Dargan. I'm a dentist. When I ask my patients to start flossing, they say... ""but I do that already!"" 
You can see the problem! 




We all know that flossing properly is hard to do. So I invented FlossiO, a patented innovative dental flosser that helps you floss properly. It's also the only disposable flosser that can floss the whole mouth with clean floss in one go! We believe it's better than the other dental flossers available today, and we think you will too! 



            
                  



FlossiO consists of a loop of dental floss held by two finger rings. A unique feature is that the user can easily move to a fresh piece of floss for each tooth without taking the rings off the fingers due to the patented design that allows the floss to move through the rings. Rings that hold floss have been designed before, but they use a fixed section of floss that has to be loaded by the user, and will only floss a few teeth before getting worn. 
The best way to floss is using normal dental floss. Used properly, it provides a strong ""blade"" of floss to scrape deposits of tartar from between the teeth. Control,  strength and anchorage is provided by the fingers. Also, the user can move to a fresh section of floss by unwinding the floss off one finger and winding it up on the other. This procedure, however, is difficult, time consuming, requires dexterity, and can hurt the fingers. FlossiO incorporates all the advantages of flossing properly, while eliminating the disadvantages. 



Other disposable flossers...

Are weak and therefore bend when used.
Have only one short length of floss that will transfer bacteria and plaque around the mouth.
Require floss to be attached by the user.
Have heads that come off and get stuck between the teeth.
Are big and bulky and therefore not very portable.
Are shaped in a way that makes access to the back teeth difficult.


FlossiO has the following advantages
1. Bacteria are not transferred between teeth.
2. One device will floss the whole mouth hygienically.
3. Provides more control from the strength and anchorage of the fingers.
4. Individually wrapped for hygiene and portability. 
5. No more sore fingers.
6. No heads that can dislodge and get stuck between teeth. 












1. Place rings on the middle fingers.
2. Stretch floss with index fingers or thumbs.
3. Work floss between teeth and scrape teeth up and down.
4. Pull floss to move to a fresh piece.
5. Repeat for each tooth.

Background



Dargan Dental Limited is a company incorporated in Ireland on 2 September 2014. (Company no. 548984. https://search.cro.ie/company/CompanySearch.aspx). It was founded by Dr. Joseph Dargan, who has been a general practice for 25 years. He worked in the U.K. for 5 years before setting up his own dental practice in Ireland's largest shopping centre in Blanchardstown, Dublin, in 1998. (www.gums.ie, www.blanchardstowncentre.ie). 


                          

We've been developing FlossiO for over two years and will soon be ready to start production. This money will help us with essential startup costs such as machinery, patenting, marketing, insurance and ordering of the first batch. The total needed for year 1 is €18,845.00. We have invested over two years in Research and Development. We have an Irish patent (No. S86501) and U.S. patent pending (No. 15/051,768). Our County Enterprise Office (Fingal, Swords, Co. Dublin) was also impressed and has granted €5000.00 for machinery and patenting, but we need to raise the balance of €13,845.00 ($15,469.00) before the grant can be drawn down. To make this much profit we need to sell approximately $72,000.00 worth of FlossiOs!




It will take up to three months before the product is ready for shipping. 
Initially the business model is to sell directly to Dentists, but anyone can buy FlossiO. Our first marketing drive will target the U.K. This will give us an idea for demand in other countries, but FlossiO will be available to buy worldwide. FlossiO pre-order special offers are also available worldwide on Indiegogo. FlossiO is a registered Trade Mark and we own the domain www.flossio.com

The Future
Initially FlossiO will be manufactured manually. This is because of the high costs involved with automation. A disadvantage of manual manufacturing is a limited production capacity. During the first year we will be able to gauge demand and begin funding for automation. Automation will cost approximately €100,000.00.

<p>JAT Industries is very excited to introduce to you and
the world a revolutionary protein product that will be a permanent staple in your
food as well as uniquely positioned to become a key player in the health and
wellness industry, infant formula and baby food industry, animal food industry,
and cosmetic industry.  Our protein
product is by far the cleanest and highest protein concentrate in the world with
a 66% base protein level and with ZERO contamination (a factual claim supported
by third party lab documentation through two of the industry’s top independent scientific
labs).  We have the incredible ability through
proprietary technology to produce our organic, non-GMO, clean, contaminant-free
algae protein up to 100% protein concentrate. 
Additionally, we will offer our unique protein products to the
marketplace in powder form, paste form, and liquid slurry for sports nutrition and
protein drinks.  Moreover, through
patented technology, JAT industries will introduce the world’s ONLY off-white
algae protein (for those of you who don’t like the idea of eating anything
green) and still retain all the powerful nutritional benefits that our algae
protein has to offer.  JAT Industries
will remain a raw materials manufacturer of Algae protein for the food
industries with future plans to offer our revolutionary products direct to the
consumer.  </p>

what is currently being added in our foods today, how unhealthy ingredients
loaded with toxins, heavy metals, hormones, GMO, and pesticides are riddled in
the ingredients added to our food.  It’s
people like you who have said we’ve had enough. 
You’ve made a conscious decision to change the way you eat and what you
feed your families.  We hear you and we
have spent countless hours, months, and years to arrive at this day and cannot
wait to get our algae protein out into the world to help people feel better,
heal their illnesses, and ultimately improve their overall health.  With you and your generous contributions, we
can get this out there to the masses faster and on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>JAT Industries, headquartered in Denver Colorado, has been
in business for three years conducting in-depth research to find the most cutting
edge and efficient technology out there that can adequately introduce the
powerful superfood that is Spirulina Algae. 
JAT Industries has already established relationships with distributors
who are excited to introduce our algae protein products, so much so that they have
already test marketed our green and off-white algae.  The response has been overwhelming.  We currently have two years of our product
already committed with staggering orders pledged once we begin manufacturing
and harvesting at our soon to be established state of the art facility in South
Florida.  We will need to generate extra
working capital for immediate expansion of our facilities to meet their purchase
requests.  We need your help; there is no

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>In the global community, people face
mounting problems because of climate change, a growing population competing for
food and water resources, and strains on the global economic system as
governments, countries, NGOs (non-government organizations), and the business
community struggle to find viable cost-effective solutions.  The onset of these issues has prompted the
emergence of green industries built on the concept of sustainability that focus
on ways not only that benefit people but also benefit the environment.</p>
<p>In a report by Miller (2014), severe
drought conditions in California brought on by climate change could threaten
agriculture production of more than 25% of the nation’s food crops since more
than 80% of the available water is used by California’s agricultural industry.  According to Schiavenza (2015), “California
is the world’s fifth-largest supplier of food, a big reason why the state
would, if an independent country, be the 7<sup>th</sup> largest economy in the
world” (para. 3).  It is the leading
producer of many important food crops such as almonds, artichokes, broccoli,
lemons, pistachios, spinach, and tomatoes. 
Nonetheless, California agriculture lost more than $2.2 billion in 2014
and approximately 17,000 farmers lost their jobs in 2014 as a result of
drought.  Therefore, farmers have had to
rethink which crops to produce because of water and production
constraints.  This is also true in other
parts of the world where water and fertile land resources have become scarce
due to changing conditions.  However, as
shown in the charts below, production of the algae known as spirulina can
significantly cut land and water requirements to help conserve land and water
resources as well as increase protein production for a growing population. </p>

<p>Source:  AlgaeIndustryMagazine.com. (2011). <i>Special report: Spirulina part 7. The future
of spirulina in an evolving world</i>.</p>
<p>In addition to the foregoing, increased
concerns over GMO crop safety and the use of pesticides in global agricultural
production has prompted public outcry for healthier food options.  In addition, the global community is
demonstrating greater awareness of the need to implement green alternatives
throughout the business sector to mitigate climate change and decrease the
world’s carbon footprint.  Because of
these concerns, the emergence of green industries has grown in recent years
because of public interest and demand. 
One of these key industries concerns the growth, harvesting, and
distribution of algae products such as spirulina and chlorella in the food and
nutrition market because of the high-protein content, vitamin and mineral
makeup, lack of contamination, and sustainable production.  AlgaeIndustryMagazine.com (2015) noted the
use of algae in food, beverages, and nutritional supplements continues to
expand.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442248542/lvnrpe8rmzkgicojfpgc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>In a report by Piccolo (2011) funded
by the European Union, he noted the high nutritional value of spirulina as well
as its high protein content.  Further, it
“yields 20 times more protein per acre than soybeans, 40 times more than corn,
and over 200 times more than beef” (Piccolo, 2011, p. 9).  Because of this, it is classified as a
superfood.  As a superfood, spirulina possesses
a strong nutrient profile that consists of protein, vitamins, and other
phytonutrients, thus demonstrating a higher potency than other foods.  For example, it contains a higher protein
content (approximately 65% or higher) than other natural foods; whereas,
soybeans possess 35% protein content and animal protein typically consists of
25%.  Further, it possesses a higher
concentration of vitamins and minerals boasting the highest levels of beta
carotene and vitamin B-12.  It also
contains rich levels of B-complex vitamins, iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and
other trace minerals such as manganese, chromium, and selenium.  Statistics show that spirulina has 2300% more
iron than spinach, 3900% more beta carotene than carrots, 300% more calcium
than whole milk, 375% more protein than tofu, and possesses 31 times more
potency in phytonutrient levels than blueberries. </p>
<p>Piccolo (2011) also noted 10
important benefits of the consumption of 5-10 grams of spirulina each day:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It

</li>
</ul>
<p>These health benefits underscore the
importance of spirulina.  This superfood
can benefit people in the Western world who need its nutritional value to
supplement a diet already clouded with unhealthy foods.  Further, it can benefit people in developing
countries who suffer from malnutrition. 
Spirulina already has legal approval as a food or supplement in various
countries to include Europe, Japan, the United States, and many others.  Further, spirulina has GRAS (Generally
Accepted as Safe) status, thereby demonstrating that it is a safe food for ingestion.  </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Not only can the use of algae reap
nutritional benefits, but the algae production industry is good for the
environment because it feeds on carbon (Shaffer, 2011).  Thus, the algae industry has a positive
environmental impact because it helps to mitigate the high levels of carbon
emissions in the atmosphere from human activity and the burning of fossil
fuels. </p>
<p>According to the 2015 Algae Industry
Survey, three critical challenges exist for the algae industry to include: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The

</li>
</ul>
<p>While most manufacturers deal with these issues, the
use of a proprietary process by JAT Industries LLC mitigates these issues
significantly to allow for greater cost-effectiveness, increased harvesting of
algae, and larger-scale production capabilities.</p>

JAT Industries is very excited to introduce to you and
the world a revolutionary protein product that will be a permanent staple in your
food as well as uniquely positioned to become a key player in the health and
wellness industry, infant formula and baby food industry, animal food industry,
and cosmetic industry.  Our protein
product is by far the cleanest and highest protein concentrate in the world with
a 66% base protein level and with ZERO contamination (a factual claim supported
by third party lab documentation through two of the industry’s top independent scientific
labs).  We have the incredible ability through
proprietary technology to produce our organic, non-GMO, clean, contaminant-free
algae protein up to 100% protein concentrate. 
Additionally, we will offer our unique protein products to the
marketplace in powder form, paste form, and liquid slurry for sports nutrition and
protein drinks.  Moreover, through
patented technology, JAT industries will introduce the world’s ONLY off-white
algae protein (for those of you who don’t like the idea of eating anything
green) and still retain all the powerful nutritional benefits that our algae
protein has to offer.  JAT Industries
will remain a raw materials manufacturer of Algae protein for the food
industries with future plans to offer our revolutionary products direct to the
consumer.  


We are very passionate BUT also VERY concerned about
what is currently being added in our foods today, how unhealthy ingredients
loaded with toxins, heavy metals, hormones, GMO, and pesticides are riddled in
the ingredients added to our food.  It’s
people like you who have said we’ve had enough. 
You’ve made a conscious decision to change the way you eat and what you
feed your families.  We hear you and we
have spent countless hours, months, and years to arrive at this day and cannot
wait to get our algae protein out into the world to help people feel better,
heal their illnesses, and ultimately improve their overall health.  With you and your generous contributions, we
can get this out there to the masses faster and on a much larger scale.

We believe that our protein products will change many
of the different industries’ attitudes about “acceptable ingredients” and the lack
of healthy ingredients, specifically protein as a vital supplement needed daily
for our survival and create a movement motivating many food manufacturers to
adopt a more health conscious attitude towards the ingredients they introduce
into our food that we buy and consume.
In our video, we introduce our CEO, Mr. Donald Gerhardt, who shares with you an extensive knowledge based on years of research about what is currently being found in our foods.  Examples found include heavy metals in fish and fish oil, synthetic hormones found in key protein sources such as cows and chickens, and pesticides within the food chain.  All of these harmful substances currently exist in the meat we consume.  Mr. Gerhardt will also provide you with very helpful information about the different protein sources out there, what the good, bad, and ugly is about them, and why our algae protein is light years ahead of anything available right now.  

What We Need & What You Get
 
JAT Industries, headquartered in Denver Colorado, has been
in business for three years conducting in-depth research to find the most cutting
edge and efficient technology out there that can adequately introduce the
powerful superfood that is Spirulina Algae. 
JAT Industries has already established relationships with distributors
who are excited to introduce our algae protein products, so much so that they have
already test marketed our green and off-white algae.  The response has been overwhelming.  We currently have two years of our product
already committed with staggering orders pledged once we begin manufacturing
and harvesting at our soon to be established state of the art facility in South
Florida.  We will need to generate extra
working capital for immediate expansion of our facilities to meet their purchase
requests.  We need your help; there is no
question about that.  Your contributions
will help us acquire the land needed to create this commercial endeavor.  It will also allow us to build the 5,000
square foot facility used to harvest and dry the algae protein.  This will include an FDA -approved clean room
assuring no contamination during the packaging of our products.  In addition, in the field out behind the
facility, we will construct the many hermetically-sealed bio-reactors to ensure
zero contamination penetration.  And
finally, we can begin harvesting our superior clean, high protein Spirulina algae
on a commercial scale.
Your contribution and your help in spreading the news
about our product campaign not only will help us accomplish our $1.5 million
dollar goal to begin manufacturing and harvesting our superior, high
concentrate algae protein, but also will help us continue to generate
additional capital to allow for immediate expansion to address the growing
demand for our algae protein in the future. 
If only 200,000 people contributed $50, we would raise our highest level
of capitalization needed of $10 million dollars to bring our product to the
global market.  We would be able to
generate a massive presence in the market where there is already demand for our

The Impact 
In the global community, people face
mounting problems because of climate change, a growing population competing for
food and water resources, and strains on the global economic system as
governments, countries, NGOs (non-government organizations), and the business
community struggle to find viable cost-effective solutions.  The onset of these issues has prompted the
emergence of green industries built on the concept of sustainability that focus
on ways not only that benefit people but also benefit the environment.
In a report by Miller (2014), severe

agriculture production of more than 25% of the nation’s food crops since more
than 80% of the available water is used by California’s agricultural industry.  According to Schiavenza (2015), “California
is the world’s fifth-largest supplier of food, a big reason why the state

can benefit people in the Western world who need its nutritional value to
supplement a diet already clouded with unhealthy foods.  Further, it can benefit people in developing
countries who suffer from malnutrition. 
Spirulina already has legal approval as a food or supplement in various
countries to include Europe, Japan, the United States, and many others.  Further, spirulina has GRAS (Generally
Accepted as Safe) status, thereby demonstrating that it is a safe food for ingestion.  



Not only can the use of algae reap
nutritional benefits, but the algae production industry is good for the
environment because it feeds on carbon (Shaffer, 2011).  Thus, the algae industry has a positive
environmental impact because it helps to mitigate the high levels of carbon
emissions in the atmosphere from human activity and the burning of fossil
fuels. 
According to the 2015 Algae Industry
Survey, three critical challenges exist for the algae industry to include: 



The
establishment of cost-efficient production systems


Harvesting
and extraction systems


Scale
of production facilities


While most manufacturers deal with these issues, the
use of a proprietary process by JAT Industries LLC mitigates these issues
significantly to allow for greater cost-effectiveness, increased harvesting of
algae, and larger-scale production capabilities.

Risks & Challenges
 While most new companies face significant hurdles in the beginning because of just trying to get their product out there to the public, we don't have that issue.  In fact, we've had some of the largest manufacturers out there expressing strong interest in our product.  In fact, we've already received a large purchase order for our product with the commitment that several others will be forthcoming once we begin operations.  So, we feel very confident that we will exceed our business and manufacturing goals once we begin actual farming operations to produce our algae for our buyers.  What this means to you is far less risk than you would encounter with another new business operation.  In fact, we think our biggest challenge will be growing our algae protein fast enough to keep up with the demand.  That's a much better position to be in than not having real interest from real buyers in our algae protein.  
 
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

Both responses were very positive and both recommended that I pursue the project.

My name is Kristi Toguchi and I am the owner of Aerial Fitness, located in The Entertainment Capital of the world, Las Vegas, Nevada. I have been fortunate to have a career that has allowed me to travel the globe while sharing my art. My most rewarding shows were the opportunities to share my knowledge and craft with my community. As a third generation performer, I have followed in the footsteps of my father and grandfather. My predecessors were inspiring men who took great joy in performing at senior homes, public libraries, Shriners Hospitals, and various community events. Since both my father and grandfather have passed, I have continued our legacy and family tradition of helping my community through art and service.  </p>
<p>Blood donations are very close to my heart. My father is featured on the Wall of Fame at the Hawaii Blood Bank for donating blood 142 times. My plan is to multiply that number tenfold and beyond! To achieve this goal, I will require quite a bit of help. My mission is to spread awareness on the importance of blood banks across the nation along with providing opportunities to those who dream of performing. I strive to combine my love of service with my passion for performance, allowing my students the experience of enhancing their lives through self expression while performing for others.</p>

Within the first year we organized our inaugural blood drive and student showcase while partnering with the Red Cross. We have also held a community event with Lorna Jane at Tivoli Village and began a stretch program with the KingdomFit Ministry of Las Vegas. This year we plan to double our community and charity events while continuing to cultivate our relationships with a myriad of local philanthropic organizations. <span style=""font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px;""> </span>

<p>As a performing artist, I have not always have the financial resources to donate to charity. The one thing I do have is my time and unique talents, which I am grateful to put to use for those in need. Our students have worked incredibly hard to perform at previous events, and due to budget issues, their costuming consisted of generic leggings and a t-shirt. I would love to provide a professional performing atmosphere for both the charity organizations we work with as well as our students and future artists.  </p>

<div>I feel honored to be associated with the next generation of community donors, entertainers, athletes, and professionals. I hope to be able to instill the importance of sharing what we have to assist others in any way we can. I became a teacher to inspire others and generate change. My goal is to create future leaders and artists who recognize the importance of giving back.  </div>

My name is Kristi Toguchi and I am the owner of Aerial Fitness, located in The Entertainment Capital of the world, Las Vegas, Nevada. I have been fortunate to have a career that has allowed me to travel the globe while sharing my art. My most rewarding shows were the opportunities to share my knowledge and craft with my community. As a third generation performer, I have followed in the footsteps of my father and grandfather. My predecessors were inspiring men who took great joy in performing at senior homes, public libraries, Shriners Hospitals, and various community events. Since both my father and grandfather have passed, I have continued our legacy and family tradition of helping my community through art and service.  
Blood donations are very close to my heart. My father is featured on the Wall of Fame at the Hawaii Blood Bank for donating blood 142 times. My plan is to multiply that number tenfold and beyond! To achieve this goal, I will require quite a bit of help. My mission is to spread awareness on the importance of blood banks across the nation along with providing opportunities to those who dream of performing. I strive to combine my love of service with my passion for performance, allowing my students the experience of enhancing their lives through self expression while performing for others.

Our Project
After my father passed away, I decided to open my school, Aerial Fitness. Within the first year we organized our inaugural blood drive and student showcase while partnering with the Red Cross. We have also held a community event with Lorna Jane at Tivoli Village and began a stretch program with the KingdomFit Ministry of Las Vegas. This year we plan to double our community and charity events while continuing to cultivate our relationships with a myriad of local philanthropic organizations.  



As a performing artist, I have not always have the financial resources to donate to charity. The one thing I do have is my time and unique talents, which I am grateful to put to use for those in need. Our students have worked incredibly hard to perform at previous events, and due to budget issues, their costuming consisted of generic leggings and a t-shirt. I would love to provide a professional performing atmosphere for both the charity organizations we work with as well as our students and future artists.  
Please visit http://www.Aerial-Fitness.net/Blog to view our past charity and community events
I feel honored to be associated with the next generation of community donors, entertainers, athletes, and professionals. I hope to be able to instill the importance of sharing what we have to assist others in any way we can. I became a teacher to inspire others and generate change. My goal is to create future leaders and artists who recognize the importance of giving back.  


Please share this campaign as widely as possible on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media!

Just like in terms of monetary debt, a small amount of deficit accumulates unbeknownst to yourself and causes various health related issues such as loss of concentration, obesity, aging, and difficulty in performing everyday tasks. If the condition is neglected for an extended amount of time, it can lead to serious problems like increased cancer risks due to low hormone level or dementia.However it is said that the sleep debt can be repaid with quality sleep How do we create a natural sleeping environment without relying on sleep inducing drugs?Changing your daily habits such as going to bed early and refraining from using smartphones before sleeping can indeed help. However, the importance of optimizing your sleeping environment by focusing on the sensual stimulus surrounding you cannot be overstated.Refrain from taking caffeine or alcohol related beverages later in the eveningFinish eating big meals three hours before bed.Take a bath instead of a shower.No screen time 1 hour before bed. Turn off your smartphone, TV and PC.Use bedclothes and pillows that match your body.“Sleepion” is developed to act upon your three basic senses, the audible, visual and scent, to restore your circadian rhythm and bring back your natural healing power induced by sleeping deeply.  Your ordinary sleep may not be enough. Resting your brain and body by reaching the deepest “State 4” sleep, which only exists in humans, is the key in waking up refreshed and keeping yourself energized throughout the day.A first of its kind, palm-sized tool to create your ideal sleeping environment that lets you sleep deeply and gently. Sleepion 2 will support you in tuning your body and mind to live comfortably, all throughout the day.Sleepion 2 influences your three basic senses to heighten the quality of your sleep.Natural healing sound that puts your brain to sleep.Audio impulse has a strong sleep inducing power and aids healing during your sleep.

It is also vital for emergency preparedness and natural disasters.</p><ul>
<li>The dual function flashlight has both a standard flashlight and a red flashing beacon light to alert distress.</li>
<li>The flashlight also has a mounted signal mirror for signaling people to your location.</li>
<li>A hand pumped air horn gives you the ability to effortlessly get the attention of people around you.</li>
<li>The best feature of this device is a deploy-able 16 inch helium filled balloon that is both reflective and lit  to give visibility above the tree lines with over 100 feet of tough nylon string, increasing visibility at night and during the day.</li>
</ul><p>The modular flashlight has the ability to change to fit your needs. If you only need a flashlight, it can be removed and will function independent of the other sections. You can combine the flashlight and the balloon, the balloon and the air horn, or the air horn and the flashlight.</p><p>You can customize the light to fill your needs. Once we are ready for manufacturing, each piece can be bought separately, making the helium canister easy to replace when used.</p><p>The Signal Light is what everyone should have when they venture out into the wilderness, what every car should have stored in case of getting stranded, the compact device to be added to every emergency kit, 72 hour kit and survival kit. The Signal Light makes you seen when you can’t see your way out.</p><p>Help the Signal Light get to the next step!</p><hr/><h3>Where did the idea for the Signal Light come from?</h3><p><a href=""http://www.thesignallight.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/exploded.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""exploded"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thesignallight.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/exploded-300x194.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p>* Patent Pending</p><p>What would you do if you were lost? Stranded?  Hurt or stuck in a natural disaster?   What would you take with you so that people around you would be alerted to your distress?  The Signal Light is the multi-combinational devise that can alert others to your needs.</p><p>I developed the Signal Light with my own child’s safety in mind.  He was at the age that he was going off on scout camp-outs without my husband or I and when we would quiz him on what he should do if he got lost or stranded somewhere to get someone to help him he really didn’t have answers that we thought were sufficient.</p><p>As a mom, that intense protective drive set in and I was determined to come up with something that would make a difference if the unspeakable were to happen.  I started doing some research on what were the best things to bring to help people find a missing person. Whistles, signal mirrors, lighting fires and using smoke signals… all these things were frequently mentioned.  So, I started sending my son with these items.</p><h3>The Problem</h3><p>Then one camp out he went on a five mile hike and I asked him if he took all those things with him on the hike, because if there were an activity that made the stakes for getting lost or stranded higher, this was it.  He replied that it was too much stuff to remember and he didn’t have time to grab all of it.</p><p>Being the problem solving mom that I was, the next trip he took I put them all in a bag so he could easily grab them together and go; still he didn’t take them with- it took up too much space in his back pack. I had to come up with something else. I had to make it easier for him to grab and go.</p><p>I  wanted to have the best options for my son to be found. I focused on three essential things to be found: Being seen, being heard and staying put.  I wanted  something better than a whistle and a signal mirror- I wanted to give my son the best chance at getting found.  And, it all needed to be packaged together and convenient to grab and go.</p><h3>Where to Start?</h3><p><strong>Sight:</strong> A signal mirror is what I heard mentioned for being seen.  What if the lost person was in a deeply wooded area and the mirror can’t be seen by anyone, what about at night or a cloudy day?  Would the signal mirror be effective then?</p><p>My husband and I were discussing the problems with the mirror while driving one day and drove past a car lot with huge balloons in the air.

It is also vital for emergency preparedness and natural disasters.
The dual function flashlight has both a standard flashlight and a red flashing beacon light to alert distress.
The flashlight also has a mounted signal mirror for signaling people to your location.
A hand pumped air horn gives you the ability to effortlessly get the attention of people around you.
The best feature of this device is a deploy-able 16 inch helium filled balloon that is both reflective and lit  to give visibility above the tree lines with over 100 feet of tough nylon string, increasing visibility at night and during the day.
The modular flashlight has the ability to change to fit your needs. If you only need a flashlight, it can be removed and will function independent of the other sections. You can combine the flashlight and the balloon, the balloon and the air horn, or the air horn and the flashlight.You can customize the light to fill your needs. Once we are ready for manufacturing, each piece can be bought separately, making the helium canister easy to replace when used.The Signal Light is what everyone should have when they venture out into the wilderness, what every car should have stored in case of getting stranded, the compact device to be added to every emergency kit, 72 hour kit and survival kit. The Signal Light makes you seen when you can’t see your way out.Help the Signal Light get to the next step!Where did the idea for the Signal Light come from?* Patent PendingWhat would you do if you were lost? Stranded?  Hurt or stuck in a natural disaster?   What would you take with you so that people around you would be alerted to your distress?  The Signal Light is the multi-combinational devise that can alert others to your needs.I developed the Signal Light with my own child’s safety in mind.  He was at the age that he was going off on scout camp-outs without my husband or I and when we would quiz him on what he should do if he got lost or stranded somewhere to get someone to help him he really didn’t have answers that we thought were sufficient.As a mom, that intense protective drive set in and I was determined to come up with something that would make a difference if the unspeakable were to happen.  I started doing some research on what were the best things to bring to help people find a missing person. Whistles, signal mirrors, lighting fires and using smoke signals… all these things were frequently mentioned.  So, I started sending my son with these items.The ProblemThen one camp out he went on a five mile hike and I asked him if he took all those things with him on the hike, because if there were an activity that made the stakes for getting lost or stranded higher, this was it.  He replied that it was too much stuff to remember and he didn’t have time to grab all of it.Being the problem solving mom that I was, the next trip he took I put them all in a bag so he could easily grab them together and go; still he didn’t take them with- it took up too much space in his back pack. I had to come up with something else. I had to make it easier for him to grab and go.I  wanted to have the best options for my son to be found. I focused on three essential things to be found: Being seen, being heard and staying put.  I wanted  something better than a whistle and a signal mirror- I wanted to give my son the best chance at getting found.  And, it all needed to be packaged together and convenient to grab and go.Where to Start?Sight: A signal mirror is what I heard mentioned for being seen.  What if the lost person was in a deeply wooded area and the mirror can’t be seen by anyone, what about at night or a cloudy day?  Would the signal mirror be effective then?My husband and I were discussing the problems with the mirror while driving one day and drove past a car lot with huge balloons in the air. We noticed how far away we could see that balloon and thought  it was a great way to be seen. What if we could include that?It could get above the tree lines unlike the mirror, it was effortless after its deployed unlike the mirror,  and no matter the time of day or weather, it was still effective. If we included reflective tails and lit the balloon we would have even more visibility.  So we had a goal: include a helium fill-able balloon in the devise.Sound: A whistle is the standard thing to take with you…but we saw so many problems with this.To be effective, it requires a lot of deep breaths, if you’ve been stuck for a while, you’re exhausted.  A whistle is a high pitch noise, lower sounds travel farther.  Whistles are small and can be deformed easily if sat on or not packed well in a back pack making it useless.I had to come up with something better than a whistle.  Similar to how the balloon came to us, we went to a bike race at a nearby park and heard a lot of air horns.  That would be much better than a whistle, but how do we work around the air canister problem?  A hand pumped air horn!Our noise making goal was accomplished.Staying put: So many rescue missions are complicated with people wandering around trying to find their own way out.  When people stay where they originally became lost, search and rescue becomes a much easier  task.I felt confident that if the lost person had a balloon launched and an air horn they would feel like that was essentially their base camp, they would feel more confident in staying where they were.  The first two conclusions have concluded our last goal.Putting It All TogetherMy son gave me three problems to work through if he would actually use the things I wanted him to take:  It needed to be  packaged together, easy to grab, and not take up too much room.  So I started thinking of ways that I could pair the air horn and balloon system together.We came up with a few capsule designs, but they seemed bulky and we thought that even packaged together, they would get left behind if a back pack was too full from other gear.So I thought of things that you typically grab with every outing: water, food, a pocket knife, flashlight.  Maybe I needed to pair this with one of those items.  Not everyone was comfortable sending their child with a pocket knife and there are so many multi-use pocket knives on the market already.So I started toying around with combining it with a flashlight.Designed Around a Flashlight* Patent PendingI bought a handful or different flashlights in different sizes, ordered some hand pumped air horns and helium canisters, and started playing Frankenstein.  Lucky for me, my husband is an engineer and has a 3-D printer, so my development of this product was much easier than so many other inventors.He and I would take a flashlight completely apart, use the circuit board and bulbs and add it into a new sleeve that would fit the helium capsule and air horn.

 a special optically clear conformal coating at the suggestion of 
engineers at Dow Corning. This super-tough coating is used for solar 
energy projects, where long term exposure to ultraviolet light, intense 
heat, and intense cold can take their toll. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430854628/jxqrhas7z14hiy0opdtm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3><b>Brake light/deceleration light – what’s the difference? </b></h3><p>Well, quite a bit.

Lucid Brake is a bike brake light that doesn't need to be wired to your bike! 


You can even attach LucidBrake to your helmet or to a back pack. 


The higher the light is on your person, the farther away it can be seen in traffic.


Mount it Anywhere – LucidBRAKE has a flat back which gives you options...You can mount it on your seat post, fender, jacket, backpack, flag, basket or helmet. Big Improvements for LucidBrake 2.0: 

 Better power management. We swapped out the power circuit used in 
the last LucidBrake because it didn't last the year in the garage that

 like your helmet - and it will still work great!LucidBrake is WaterproofRunning perfectly while totally submerged in water.There is no ""on/off"" switch - LucidBrake senses if it 
is parked / in motion / braking / in your backpack or on a shelf. If at 
rest, or facing up or down, the circuitry stays in ultra-low-power 
""sleep"" mode.
But wait... there is so much more! No other brake light has this next feature... but we think they all should!Two-speed braking(demonstrated in the video)Everyone knows there is a difference between putting on your brakes and slamming on your brakes. LucidBrake
 has been designed to indicate these two quite different deceleration 
events. It will flash and then stay on for several seconds if you 
drastically reduce speed or stop suddenly. Four Beacon Modes(demonstrated in the video)
LucidBrake doubles as an awareness beacon. 
During night time road tests, LucidBrake’s eight super bright LEDs could
 be seen flashing over half a mile away. 
There are 4 different beacon modes to choose from. You choose which 
one you want by mounting the LucidBrake at a 0, 90, 180, or 270 degree 
angle. 
Low Total Mass
We thought ""way outside the box"" during the design of LucidBrake. Avid bikers insisted on low total mass, so
 instead of encasing the board in a plastic case, subject to water 
retention, internal fogging, and other problems, we encased the board in
 a special optically clear conformal coating at the suggestion of 
engineers at Dow Corning. This super-tough coating is used for solar 
energy projects, where long term exposure to ultraviolet light, intense 
heat, and intense cold can take their toll. Brake light/deceleration light – what’s the difference? Well, quite a bit. Most people are used to brake lights only coming on when they press a pedal or squeeze a handle, but LucidBrake is different. It is smart enough to know you are slowing down or stopping without it having to be wired up to anything. It senses inertial (motion) changes, then flashes brightly if it senses deceleration.",6.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<p>My husband, Jon, and I have dreamt of owning a business since we got married and were traveling the country with his military career, over 15 years ago. During that time we talked about what life would be like when he retired from the military and how we hoped for more time to truly relax and find even more enjoyment in our lives. We have both valued professions where we were able to give back and serve people, but felt a desire to find more balance in our lives.</p>
<p>So, the time is now here for us to dive in and claim the next phase of our journey! Jon retired from the military in April and I am quitting my full-time job in higher education to focus on owning and operating the yoga studio.

Obsidian Gathering will also be a catalyst for increasing civic participation in the Parkour community. Our goal is for attendees to take the spirit of Obsidian Gathering with them to their communities and show their friends, practitioners and non-practitioners alike, how important and easy it is to make their voices heard in the enormously important field of local, state and national politics. Millenials are the largest generation in America and if we participate and encourage our peers to do the same then we can massively influence the political course of the USA for years to come.</p><p>We are confident that we can successfully organize and run Obsidian Gathering because of our years of experience as community leaders. In 2014 I created, planned and ran the first Floor Jam in the Raleigh/Durham, NC area. Practitioners from New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina attended. The event has since been run by Enso Movement and has expanded in attendance as well as the participation of practitioners from across the country. You should definitely go to this year’s event ;). My years of experience working on my parents’ campaigns and my research of America’s political system and history have prepared me for the political aspects of Obsidian Gathering.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>The largest challenges for organizing Obsidian Gathering are raising enough money and generating enough interest.

 Contingency PlansIf the goal is not reached and there are not enough funds to complete the orders for wristbands and T-shirts then all of the money will be refunded to funders.If the goal is not reached but there are enough funds to insure the event, feed all of the participants and complete the orders for wristbands and T-shirts then the event will continue on a reduced budget.The ImpactObsidian Gathering provides value to us and the entire Parkour community by celebrating our integral involvement in the creation of American culture, society and history. Obsidian Gathering will also be a catalyst for increasing civic participation in the Parkour community. Our goal is for attendees to take the spirit of Obsidian Gathering with them to their communities and show their friends, practitioners and non-practitioners alike, how important and easy it is to make their voices heard in the enormously important field of local, state and national politics. Millenials are the largest generation in America and if we participate and encourage our peers to do the same then we can massively influence the political course of the USA for years to come.We are confident that we can successfully organize and run Obsidian Gathering because of our years of experience as community leaders. In 2014 I created, planned and ran the first Floor Jam in the Raleigh/Durham, NC area. Practitioners from New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina attended. The event has since been run by Enso Movement and has expanded in attendance as well as the participation of practitioners from across the country. You should definitely go to this year’s event ;). My years of experience working on my parents’ campaigns and my research of America’s political system and history have prepared me for the political aspects of Obsidian Gathering. Risks & ChallengesThe largest challenges for organizing Obsidian Gathering are raising enough money and generating enough interest. We’ll need you to help us by donating any amount that you can spare and by spreading the word about Obsidian Gathering. Please share the IndieGoGo event page and invite anyone you think would be interested in attending the event or supporting us. Every contribution, share and invite will help us get closer to our goal! We can’t thank you enough for lending us your attention and contributing in anyway that you can!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Alphonsine Ndayikengurukiye, the founder of <i>Maranathan

Burundi. This non-profit is an international organization established to help

With a network of volunteers around the world, Maranathan has managed to
provide medical assistance and nourishment to hundreds of people struggling in
the region.</p>
<p>We face many difficulties as a country. Though <i>Maranathan</i> has

are in need and offer assistance ; partner with those who are able to help
others as they share their resources and their valuable time; and collaborate with

<p>The Organization was Founded to help vulnerable people to
overcome some difficulties, which they face on daily basis through prayer and

<p>There are so many awesome things to say about our weekend at camp confidence but the couple things that stood out most to me were the happiness and positivity I saw in each person. Every person who attended was so happy to be there and be apart of this experience. We were faced with challenges and each person has different insecurities that they had to overcome. The teamwork, trust, communication, leadership, humility, fun, and love that was portrayed by each person and group was beyond amazing! There is truly nothing more wonderful than to see your children find their voice and confidence.

We'd like to turn KC Camp Confidence from a Day Camp into an outdoor, high-energy 2 - 14 day overnight summer camp that we hope to be located on 150 Acres in the heart of Kansas City, Mo. Ages (8 – 18) will have the opportunity to run their own city for 2 weeks and be led by professionally trained peer counselors and Mentors.  The	camp’s	goal	is	to	equip	children with skills needed to	be	effective	and	successful	in	life such as: leadership,	confidence,	team building, money	management and communication	skills.

Campers have the opportunity to engage in fun, wholesome recreational and team building activities including sports, music/dance, and visual art while learning critical life skills such as building self-and team confidence, building solid friendships as well as learning how to save and manage money.  

BENEFITS TO KC CAMPERS: 2015 DAY CAMP TESTIMONIALS

Jasmin Atagi Northcutt           Yesterday at 1:58pm
There are so many awesome things to say about our weekend at camp confidence but the couple things that stood out most to me were the happiness and positivity I saw in each person. Every person who attended was so happy to be there and be apart of this experience. We were faced with challenges and each person has different insecurities that they had to overcome. The teamwork, trust, communication, leadership, humility, fun, and love that was portrayed by each person and group was beyond amazing! There is truly nothing more wonderful than to see your children find their voice and confidence. Thank you Terra and Lance for giving everyone this amazing opportunity to continue to grow in such a positive way! So excited to be apart of KC Camp Confidence!

</div><div>
<span>Displays of intense
anger and rage are growing at a phenomenal pace in the US. The consistent use of physical and
psycho pharmacological restraints frequently end in the death or injury of the
person being restrained.  The NEIMAS-1 organization, a small behavioral health company based in
Raleigh, North Carolina, is on a mission to address this very issue.</span><br/>
</div><div>
<p>Phyllis West is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of the NEIMAS- 1 Group. From the
beginning, Dr. West's mission focused on strengthening mental health treatment
outcomes through technology. In January 2015, Dr. West established the NEIMAS-1
Corporation with the aim of designing, prototyping, manufacturing,
and marketing the Cycle Breaker Rage Reduction  Bracelet (CBB) and the
Cycle Breaker Rage Reduction Phone App (CBBA).</p>
<p><b>The Neimas-1 Group is
dedicated to the following principals:</b></p>
<p>·<span> </span>Eliminating the frequency of deaths and injuries from crisis
restraint encounters.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Providing expanded supervision and monitoring of  individuals who identified with having chronic anger and rage problems and an inability to consistently manage and control their aggression.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b><i>D</i></b>esign a  small, attractive, unidentifiable behavior modification device that:</p>
<p>o<span>  A</span>ctivates  immediately, when the
wearer is overwhelmed by physiological,social and environmental triggers and effectively reduces and/or eliminates negative default reactions to these triggers.</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>Reinforces  use of  mindfulness and self-empowering skills learned during weekly therapy sessions,including; mindfulness, grounding, somatic sensitivity, body scanning and other  self-calming management
skills.</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>Can be used in
institutions or in homes throughout the country by engaging customers,consumers and early adopters within community service agencies, law enforcement sites,  psychiatric hospitals, military personnel, and forensic facilities providing mental and behavioral health services.</p>
<p>o<span>  </span>Can be used as a stand-alone alternative to psychotropic
medication.</p>
<p>o Can be supported with diverse payment methods, including health insurance.</p>
<p>o Provides weekly  clinical  services, supervision and monitoring of CBB clients.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b><i>H</i>ow  Does the Cycle Breaker Bracelet Work?</b></p>
<p>Electrodes which are
made of flexible, non-conductive graphene fabric are attached to a flattened, 4
in. pronged, stainless steel bracelet that wraps snugly and comfortably around
the wearer's wrist and locks into place. Each Cycle Breaker Bracelet (CBB) is
assigned its own breaker code which is logged into the microprocessor. </p>
<p>The Cycle Breaker's
accompanying microprocessor is comprised of 9 different sensory bio-components
housed in a separate single database platform which monitors behavior, records
stress-related triggers, provides feedback, and upon activation manages rage misbehavior
through electrical stimulation.</p>
<p> The
microprocessor components include:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Patient position sensor accelerometer</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Pulse and oxygen in blood sensor(SP02) </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Blood pressure sensor or sphygmomanometer</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Galvanic skin response sensor (GSR)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>sweating /body temperature sensor</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Air flow sensor (respirations)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Electro-cardiogram sensor (ECG)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Glucometer sensor </p>
<p>·<span>  C</span>ustomized message center display unit, consisting of 16
colored LED lights.</p>
<p>   <b> CBB participants must
commit to the following treatment Protocols: </b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span> Comply with pre-scheduled weekly counseling sessions.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Consistent use of newly learned self-calming techniques.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Reporting to assigned clinician for deactivation of bracelet.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Weekly participation in anger and stress management groups.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Weekly telephone and Skype follow-up debriefings.</p>
<p><b> Some <i>B</i>enefits of Using the Cycle Breaker Bracelet</b></p>
<p><b><i>W</i></b>earers develop the
capacity to successfully resolve conflict and learn to:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Manage stress quickly while remaining alert and calm.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Control emotions and behavior. </p>
<p>·<span>  More focus on</span> social cues,boundaries, and needs being
expressed by others. </p>
<p>·<span>  M</span>ore awareness  and respect for the impact of personal triggers.</p>
<p>.  Treatment plans include insurance options and contracted periods of use.</p>
<p>  .Coming soon ! the cycle breaker phone App!</p>
<p>. Daily collection of meta data taken from the Bracelet's microprocessor. The role  of the microprocessor includes; analyzing  and interpreting the impact of  physiological, environmental and emotional triggers, evaluating and sorting  acute versus chronic readings,assessing and evaluating; the level of intensity,frequency,duration of triggers on the wearer and  forwarding results to the wearer's clinical manager and or  their Primary Care physician.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>Some Risks and <i>C</i>hallenges</b></p>
<p>The Cycle Breaker
Bracelet will be manufactured as a behavioral health device to monitor
physiological activity and metabolic changes due to isolated triggers that lead
to aggressive behavior. Once a wearer becomes engaged in aggressive behavior,
the Cycle Breaker Bracelet will generate electrical stimulation at the point of
attachment on the wrist. The current stimulation acts as the primary
intervention to modify/stop violent, rage behavior and quickly eliminate
exhibitions of violence. Our hypothesis suggests that behavior modification
will become a learned response from the electrical stimulation and the
subsequent memory of the stimulation will be stored in the nervous system of
the wearer, to attenuate compliance. Until we have completed prototypes and are
able to run beta trials, our hypothesis cannot be fully tested and results may
be inconsistent. </p>
<p><b><i> Possible R</i>oad Blocks</b></p>
<p> Current studies do not
provide compelling evidence regarding the efficacy of psycho social treatments
over and above nonspecific factors for anger, intensity, and frequency
upon which anger is displayed, or for enhancing anger awareness. Furthermore,
positive effects are typically demonstrated by self-report measures, with
little or no evidence regarding the efficacy of the anger treatment on other
behavioral indices.</p>
</div><div><p>Additionally, the
findings of various US Behaviorists suggest that under some conditions,
psycho social treatment for anger can produce iatrogenic effects. Although
most treatments are at least minimally effective, there is growing
evidence making compelling cases about some of these interventions being
harmful. If mental health practitioners are to operate under the principle
of <i>primum non nocere</i> (first,
do no harm), we should be more aware of the contexts in which anger treatments
can be harmful.</p></div><div><p><br/></p></div><div>
<span><b> </b><i><b>F</b></i><b>uture Implications</b></span><br/>
</div><div>
<p>The use  of technology to immediately interrupt harmful
behavior </p>
<p><span> Concentrated use of  counseling and psychotherapy to modify anger, rage and aggression versus mandating the use of on-line anger classes that do little to correct the core problem.</span></p>
<p>More emphasis in behavioral health science to; identify, isolate and label psychological bio signatures and  default patterns before randomly  using inhumane, dangerous, or lethal restraint methods to control behavior.</p>
<p>Greater focus being placed on the selection of  behavior intervention methods that can be used to; capture environmental, social and physiological triggers, as well as, monitor, track, measure, and interpret the frequency, duration and intensity of anxiety states,  hyper alertness, rage, anger  and aggression and utilize resulting meta data to develop new drug or behavior therapy protocols. </p>
<p><span>Integrating devices such as the CB Bracelet and CB App into medical  practices to facilitate treatment planning with a focus on reducing patient stress levels, hypertension, anxiety, migraines, and other physical health issues resulting from uncontrolled anger.</span><br/></p>

Government and Behavioral Health Officials should sponsor and  support laws  requiring that  non-lethal restraint methods  be considered  first response priority use when it becomes  necessary to  restrain  an individual exhibiting rage  and uncontrolled  behavior  in the US.  Introducing An alternative!  The Cycle Breaker Rage Reduction Bracelet.  The Cycle Breaker  Bracelet  is a 21 st century  restraint device integrated  with technology. Using the Cycle Breaker Bracelet encourages the  wearer to develop responsibility for their own behavior, while increasing opportunities to become  more sensitive  to their  personal default pattern and practice using self-soothing techniques, such as, mindfulness and diaphragmatic breathing and  learn to recognize environmental, social and physiological triggers.The convenient and  habitual use  of lethal, physical restraints by law enforcement, or even chemical restraints used by psychiatric facilities, prison complexes, etc, is frankly, over used and detracts from possible  research projects seeking  alternative methods for restraining  affected individuals.In addition, the over use of lethal restraints is creating  an  environment of mistrust, anger and paranoia on the part of our citizens, and experience tells us that it is rarely necessary to use lethal restraints on individuals being detained..                                
                                     The Cycle Breaker Invention Project!       A 21st Century Solution Integrated With Technological Innovation! Over the years, the response to violent behavior and unprovoked aggression in our society has been to pay more attention to the economic, ideological, social and political factors associated with these behaviors and  any resulting consequences. This approach, in our opinion, erroneously overlooks opportunities to investigate, identify and label psychological bio markers that point directly to  predictable default patterns  linking them to  the central nervous system. For example, by linking  psychological bio markers with  their  specific default pattern, we can actually determine the impact that intrinsic neurophysiologic and external environmental factors have on behavior. And, in fact, research suggests that unchecked, aggressive behavior in adults caneventually change the brain in ways that causes serotonin activity to decrease and perhaps violent behavior to increase.  In our estimation, there are  few  small behavior health medical devices  dedicated exclusively to real time intervention and treatment of rage and anger misbehavior, or that facilitate the  modification of  rage  default patterns through its collection and interpretation  of triggers,  while teaching mindfulness and self-calming  skills that also facilitate behavior modification. 
             Innovation Technology That Manages                                          Uncontrolled Behavior...
         The Cycle
Breaker Rage Reduction (CBB)Bracelet  

Displays of intense
anger and rage are growing at a phenomenal pace in the US. The consistent use of physical and
psycho pharmacological restraints frequently end in the death or injury of the
person being restrained.  The NEIMAS-1 organization, a small behavioral health company based in
Raleigh, North Carolina, is on a mission to address this very issue.

Phyllis West is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of the NEIMAS- 1 Group. From the
beginning, Dr. West's mission focused on strengthening mental health treatment
outcomes through technology. In January 2015, Dr. West established the NEIMAS-1
Corporation with the aim of designing, prototyping, manufacturing,
and marketing the Cycle Breaker Rage Reduction  Bracelet (CBB) and the
Cycle Breaker Rage Reduction Phone App (CBBA).
The Neimas-1 Group is
dedicated to the following principals:
· Eliminating the frequency of deaths and injuries from crisis
restraint encounters.
· 
Providing expanded supervision and monitoring of  individuals who identified with having chronic anger and rage problems and an inability to consistently manage and control their aggression.
· 
Design a  small, attractive, unidentifiable behavior modification device that:
o  Activates  immediately, when the
wearer is overwhelmed by physiological,social and environmental triggers and effectively reduces and/or eliminates negative default reactions to these triggers.
o  Reinforces  use of  mindfulness and self-empowering skills learned during weekly therapy sessions,including; mindfulness, grounding, somatic sensitivity, body scanning and other  self-calming management
skills.
o  Can be used in
institutions or in homes throughout the country by engaging customers,consumers and early adopters within community service agencies, law enforcement sites,  psychiatric hospitals, military personnel, and forensic facilities providing mental and behavioral health services.
o  Can be used as a stand-alone alternative to psychotropic
medication.
o Can be supported with diverse payment methods, including health insurance.
o Provides weekly  clinical  services, supervision and monitoring of CBB clients.

How  Does the Cycle Breaker Bracelet Work?
Electrodes which are
made of flexible, non-conductive graphene fabric are attached to a flattened, 4
in. pronged, stainless steel bracelet that wraps snugly and comfortably around
the wearer's wrist and locks into place. Each Cycle Breaker Bracelet (CBB) is
assigned its own breaker code which is logged into the microprocessor. 
The Cycle Breaker's
accompanying microprocessor is comprised of 9 different sensory bio-components
housed in a separate single database platform which monitors behavior, records
stress-related triggers, provides feedback, and upon activation manages rage misbehavior
through electrical stimulation.
 The
microprocessor components include:
· 
Patient position sensor accelerometer
· 
Pulse and oxygen in blood sensor(SP02) 
· 
Blood pressure sensor or sphygmomanometer
· 
Galvanic skin response sensor (GSR)
· 
sweating /body temperature sensor
· 
Air flow sensor (respirations)
· 
Electro-cardiogram sensor (ECG)
· 
Glucometer sensor 
·  Customized message center display unit, consisting of 16
colored LED lights.
    CBB participants must
commit to the following treatment Protocols: 
· 
 Comply with pre-scheduled weekly counseling sessions.
· 
Consistent use of newly learned self-calming techniques.
· 
Reporting to assigned clinician for deactivation of bracelet.
· 
Weekly participation in anger and stress management groups.
· 
Weekly telephone and Skype follow-up debriefings.
 Some Benefits of Using the Cycle Breaker Bracelet
Wearers develop the
capacity to successfully resolve conflict and learn to:
· 
Manage stress quickly while remaining alert and calm.
· 
Control emotions and behavior. 
·  More focus on social cues,boundaries, and needs being
expressed by others. 
·  More awareness  and respect for the impact of personal triggers.
.  Treatment plans include insurance options and contracted periods of use.
  .Coming soon ! the cycle breaker phone App!
. Daily collection of meta data taken from the Bracelet's microprocessor. The role  of the microprocessor includes; analyzing  and interpreting the impact of  physiological, environmental and emotional triggers, evaluating and sorting  acute versus chronic readings,assessing and evaluating; the level of intensity,frequency,duration of triggers on the wearer and  forwarding results to the wearer's clinical manager and or  their Primary Care physician.

Some Risks and Challenges
The Cycle Breaker
Bracelet will be manufactured as a behavioral health device to monitor
physiological activity and metabolic changes due to isolated triggers that lead
to aggressive behavior. Once a wearer becomes engaged in aggressive behavior,
the Cycle Breaker Bracelet will generate electrical stimulation at the point of
attachment on the wrist. The current stimulation acts as the primary
intervention to modify/stop violent, rage behavior and quickly eliminate
exhibitions of violence. Our hypothesis suggests that behavior modification
will become a learned response from the electrical stimulation and the
subsequent memory of the stimulation will be stored in the nervous system of
the wearer, to attenuate compliance. Until we have completed prototypes and are
able to run beta trials, our hypothesis cannot be fully tested and results may
be inconsistent. 
 Possible Road Blocks
 Current studies do not
provide compelling evidence regarding the efficacy of psycho social treatments
over and above nonspecific factors for anger, intensity, and frequency
upon which anger is displayed, or for enhancing anger awareness. Furthermore,
positive effects are typically demonstrated by self-report measures, with
little or no evidence regarding the efficacy of the anger treatment on other
behavioral indices.
Additionally, the
findings of various US Behaviorists suggest that under some conditions,
psycho social treatment for anger can produce iatrogenic effects. Although
most treatments are at least minimally effective, there is growing
evidence making compelling cases about some of these interventions being
harmful. If mental health practitioners are to operate under the principle
of primum non nocere (first,
do no harm), we should be more aware of the contexts in which anger treatments
can be harmful.
 Future Implications

The use  of technology to immediately interrupt harmful
behavior 
 Concentrated use of  counseling and psychotherapy to modify anger, rage and aggression versus mandating the use of on-line anger classes that do little to correct the core problem.
More emphasis in behavioral health science to; identify, isolate and label psychological bio signatures and  default patterns before randomly  using inhumane, dangerous, or lethal restraint methods to control behavior.
Greater focus being placed on the selection of  behavior intervention methods that can be used to; capture environmental, social and physiological triggers, as well as, monitor, track, measure, and interpret the frequency, duration and intensity of anxiety states,  hyper alertness, rage, anger  and aggression and utilize resulting meta data to develop new drug or behavior therapy protocols. 
Integrating devices such as the CB Bracelet and CB App into medical  practices to facilitate treatment planning with a focus on reducing patient stress levels, hypertension, anxiety, migraines, and other physical health issues resulting from uncontrolled anger.

Coming Soon!:
An added benefit to using the Cycle Breaker Bracelet is immediate accessibility to the  Cycle Breaker Phone App, an excellent Mindfulness training and reinforcement tool.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Health Benefits of Dried Fruit Dried fruits offers some advantages over fresh fruits: a longer shelf life and portability. Dried Fruit is also highly nutritious. One piece of dried fruit contains about the same amount of nutrients as the fresh fruit, but condensed in a much smaller package. By weight, dried fruit contains up to 3.5 times the fiber, vitamins and minerals of fresh fruit. Therefore, one serving can provide a large percentage of the daily recommended intake of many vitamins and minerals, such as folate.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">

<ul>
<li><b>1. Dried fruits also
     contains more fiber than the same-sized serving of their fresh
     counterparts. Fiber helps keep your digestive system running smoothly.
     Dried apricots, for example, contain 6.5 grams per cup, while fresh
     apricots contain just 3.1 grams. According to the Harvard School of Public
     Health, it helps prevent obesity, heart disease and some forms of cancer.</b></li>
<li><b>2. Some dried fruits are a
     good source of certain antioxidants, according to a 2005 study in the
     ""Journal of the American College of Nutrition."" Phenols, a type
     of antioxidant, are more abundant in dried fruits than in some fresh
     fruits, leading researchers to advise that more dried fruits be included
     in the American diet. Plant polyphenols have been found to fight heart
     disease, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancer and degenerative diseases
     of the brain, according to the November-December 2009 issue of
     ""Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity."" They also are
     associated with health benefits such as improved blood flow, better
     digestive health, decreased oxidative damage and reduced risk of many
     diseases.</b></li>
<li><b>3. Because most of the water
     is extracted from dried fruits, their nutrients are condensed into a small
     package. Dried fruits like apricots, raisins, prunes and figs contain high
     amounts of beta carotene, vitamin E, niacin, iron, magnesium, potassium
     and calcium, reports the European Food Information Council. </b></li>
<li><b>4. Several studies have
     shown that people who eat dried fruit tend to weigh less and ingest more
     nutrients compared to individuals not eating dried fruit. Not all dried
     fruit is created equally though. Added sugars, and problematic
     preservatives &amp; processing practices can quickly offset any
     nutritional benefits dried fruits provide. It is important to avoid dried
     fruits with added sugars and preservatives. In conclusion, dried fruit
     have many health benefits. They are delicious and sweet and can be a

     ""Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity."" They also are
     associated with health benefits such as improved blood flow, better

3. Because most of the water
     is extracted from dried fruits, their nutrients are condensed into a small
     package. Dried fruits like apricots, raisins, prunes and figs contain high
     amounts of beta carotene, vitamin E, niacin, iron, magnesium, potassium
     and calcium, reports the European Food Information Council. 
4. Several studies have
     shown that people who eat dried fruit tend to weigh less and ingest more
     nutrients compared to individuals not eating dried fruit. Not all dried
     fruit is created equally though. Added sugars, and problematic
     preservatives & processing practices can quickly offset any
     nutritional benefits dried fruits provide. It is important to avoid dried
     fruits with added sugars and preservatives. In conclusion, dried fruit
     have many health benefits. They are delicious and sweet and can be a
     substitute for processed and artificially sweetened snacks for both kids and adults.

OUR FAMILY:In 2013 my father had undergone his 3rd back operation, replacing protruding and worn down lower back disks. 3 months prior, my mother left her job because of unfair wages. With the reality of medical bills and only having my mother’s limited income to rely on, the road ahead was looking pretty tough. I decided to come home and try to find a way to lessen their load and seek out my own peace of mind in the process. Giving back to my parents who had sacrificed and given me so much is one of the things that continues to motivate me.
We had begun to create a local following, selling Tamales in the farmers market in Jackson Wyoming and shaved ice at the Jackson Hole High School soccer fields. We had created our own opportunities and found hope once again. I began to play with the notion of dehydrating my own snacks since we had agreed on keeping a tight budget. 
Horacio & Rosa Morales Serving Shaved Ice & TamalesAfter doing a lot of online research and playing around with fruit and a bunch of different SPICES & HERBS, Naughty Fruit was born. With all of its health benefits, Naughty Fruit will assist in the battle over the high obesity rate which plagues the US by providing a healthy snack alternative. 
Now you can give your loved ones a snack that taste amazing and contains incredible ingredients made to increase intake of natural Herbs/Spices, and it taste absolutely DELICIOUS....! 

Risks & Challenges
 We believe our biggest issues will arise in scaling up to an ever growing demand for Naughty Fruit orders and blends, none the less we will tackle these matters as they arise and will plan accordingly. Once production is running smoothly, we will begin to produce Organic Naughty Fruit blends to cater to our growing clientele. If you have any further questions or concerns please feel free to contact us. No common allergenic elements are used in the making of Naughty Fruit.

<p>Even though the lightweight folding electric wheelchairs we provide are comparatively portable at between 20 and 30 kg or around 40 to 60 lb,  these weights are still far too heavy to lift for anybody but those with normal upper body strength.</p>
<p>What I've learned is that due to the lack of a portable lightweight electric lift in the mobility aid market, there must be hundreds of thousands of individuals with impaired mobility that are stuck between four walls and in lonely nursing homes and tiny dank apartments.</p>
<p>Now I don't get it. We've had astronauts landing on the moon in the 60s already, but somehow the market failed to identify and come up with a lightweight portable electric wheelchair lift. It's quite pathetic really.</p>
<p>Here we have our ageing parents and disabled friends not being able to access the community to satisfy even their most basic needs like shopping, attending doctor appointments, spending time with friends, going to the movies or simply getting out of the apartment for a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>I am not an engineer, but during the time I have been marketing these wheelchairs I've been overcome with the personal strength and courage that so many mobility impaired people have to come up with every day in order to cope with the frustration of severely limited mobility, something the rest of us just take for granted.</p>
<p>Seeing this need for making wheelchairs more portable motivated me to teach myself how to design parts and have them manufactured. </p>
<p>One of the first parts I actually designed and had manufactured were these sliding brackets that allowed my clients to quickly detach the back wheels of their lightweight folding electric wheelchairs in order to reduce the lifting weight.</p>
<p>This has helped scores of my clients by making it easier to lift their wheelchairs into the back of a car trunk or boot, but most do not have the dexterity nor the strength to disassemble and assemble their wheelchairs by themselves.</p>
<p>With your support, we will be able to provide mobility impaired individuals with an almost effortless solution to load their wheelchairs and mobility scooters into a car trunk or boot, and I can't wait to see all the extra smiles on their faces</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>How much funding will we need to make the Portalift a reality?</p>
<p>Our goal is to produce the Portalift at the lowest cost possible, and luckily for us we are able to source the main component (the linear actuator) from an existing factory without the need for any redesign.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the Portalift, the manufacture thereof will be outsourced to a factory that manufactures heavy duty aluminium speaker stands, and once again we will be able to take advantage of low-cost manufacturing due to the economies of scale. This factory literally produces thousands of quality aluminium speaker stands every day.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the most friendly and ergonomic design, we will be outsourcing to a very accomplished mechanical engineer with years of experience in structural design. Our aim is to minimise the weight of the unit to the extent that it provides the most portable design without compromising on user safety or ease of use.</p>
<p>The creation of the prototype will be completed as a collaboration between myself, the mechanical engineer as well as the factory.</p>
<p>Our minimum quantity that will allow us to bring the Portalift to life comes to about 100 units and  we are silently optimistic about getting funding for this many units.</p>
<p>However, we will still go ahead even if we don't fully reach our goal. </p>
<p>The factory will charge us slightly more per unit to produce less than 100 units, and even if we just have to break even we are committed to ship the product to everyone who has funded us.</p>
<p>Should we not reach the funding goal, we will still produce units for everyone who has contributed, and we believe that having a professionally manufactured product to showcase will assist us to raise the rest of the required funds necessary for getting the Portalift into mobility equipment stores on a wide enough scale for it to be available to those who may need it.</p>
<p>We are confident that we can bring the Portalift to life within 90 days from the end of the crowdfunding campaign, and if there are any delays we will be updating all our contributors. We do not foresee this though as most of the crucial landmarks in the development of the product have already been completed.</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">As mentioned in my appeal video above, the need that mobility impaired individuals have for a solution that will allow them to almost effortlessly lift their wheelchairs and mobility scooters into a car is dire.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Again and again my sympathies have been stirred as I have come across dozens of individuals who need help, disabled mothers who need all the help they can get to raise their families, mobility impaired fathers for whom portable mobility will provide a new sense of self-esteem and empowerment to get the job done of being a dad.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We have many parents who struggle to provide their disabled kids with the ability to interact with the world, simply because most electric wheelchairs are too heavy.</span><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">For the same reason, we have the disgrace of thousands of aged parents stuck between four walls in dank apartments and lonely nursing homes because of the inability to get around easily.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Coming up with this wheelchair lift is not a big ask. Your contribution will make it a reality, and the result will be that we add an untold amount of happiness and joy to the lives of those who are holding out for an easy solution that will give them portable mobility.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">As mentioned before, I am not an engineer but have brought a whole number of innovations to life, specifically for the sake of making life easier for the mobility impaired.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Among the innovations, we have developed a carer arm to steer and power our wheelchairs by simply walking behind it.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We are also busy bringing a number of other mobility innovations to life, all of them related to providing our clients with portable mobility solutions.</span><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Until now, we have manufactured these innovations in our own workshop, and the high cost of producing these one by one has been a major obstacle towards commercialization of our innovations. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We know that with your support  we can bring these innovations to life and provide the solutions that will help many people with mobility impairments live a much happier life.

<p>Our biggest challenge is to come up with a design friendly enough to make it sufficiently easy for even those with heavily impaired dexterity to use the Portalift . Ease of use and friendliness will be our main design brief, and to this end, we have identified the most creative and accomplished engineers for the design task.</p>
<p>We will be focusing on simplicity above all, with failsafe easy to use features for deploying the Portalift .</p>
<p>With the engineers we have identified, and having carefully studied their portfolios and currently successful mechanical designs for similar gadgets, we are convinced that we will bring to market a game-changing device for the mobility impaired.</p>
<p>Our other challenge for this project was to come up with a solution that would bypass the strict requirements for shipping lithium iron batteries. </p>
<p>We have overcome this by using standard 9 V batteries that are not only highly affordable and available everywhere, but which also come in rechargeable format so as to contain the costs of operating the Portalift .</p>
<p>The unit operates on voltages ranging from 20 V right up to 29 V, and therefore it is possible for you to  use a standard 20v portable electric screwdriver battery pack available from ebay or your local hardware store.</p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>We believe there are many individuals who would love to help and donate, but who would appreciate getting something tangible in return.</p>
<p>For this reason, we have identified some of the most desirable gadgets available and are offering them at steep discounts for those who would like to contribute whilst getting something tangible and useful in return.</p>
<p>You will see that we have listed some very useful gadgets for those who suffer from physical disability. </p>
<p>We have also listed some amazing rewards for those who want something useful for the kitchen, the workshop, and for those looking for useful gadgets for their mobile phones or tablets.</p>
<p>Shipping cost will be calculated according to the address, and will simply be a disbursement without any further costs added.</p>
<p>We will ship internationally using the least expensive option, and contributors will also be given the opportunity to select receiving their rewards via express Courier.</p>
<p>Once again, we are extremely grateful for any contributions you can make, and it will go a long way towards helping to make the Portalift a reality for thousands and thousands of individuals worldwide.</p>

Here we have our ageing parents and disabled friends not being able to access the community to satisfy even their most basic needs like shopping, attending doctor appointments, spending time with friends, going to the movies or simply getting out of the apartment for a breath of fresh air.
I am not an engineer, but during the time I have been marketing these wheelchairs I've been overcome with the personal strength and courage that so many mobility impaired people have to come up with every day in order to cope with the frustration of severely limited mobility, something the rest of us just take for granted.
Seeing this need for making wheelchairs more portable motivated me to teach myself how to design parts and have them manufactured. 
One of the first parts I actually designed and had manufactured were these sliding brackets that allowed my clients to quickly detach the back wheels of their lightweight folding electric wheelchairs in order to reduce the lifting weight.
This has helped scores of my clients by making it easier to lift their wheelchairs into the back of a car trunk or boot, but most do not have the dexterity nor the strength to disassemble and assemble their wheelchairs by themselves.
With your support, we will be able to provide mobility impaired individuals with an almost effortless solution to load their wheelchairs and mobility scooters into a car trunk or boot, and I can't wait to see all the extra smiles on their faces

   
What We Need & What You Get
 
How much funding will we need to make the Portalift a reality?
Our goal is to produce the Portalift at the lowest cost possible, and luckily for us we are able to source the main component (the linear actuator) from an existing factory without the need for any redesign.
As for the rest of the Portalift, the manufacture thereof will be outsourced to a factory that manufactures heavy duty aluminium speaker stands, and once again we will be able to take advantage of low-cost manufacturing due to the economies of scale. This factory literally produces thousands of quality aluminium speaker stands every day.
In order to achieve the most friendly and ergonomic design, we will be outsourcing to a very accomplished mechanical engineer with years of experience in structural design. Our aim is to minimise the weight of the unit to the extent that it provides the most portable design without compromising on user safety or ease of use.
The creation of the prototype will be completed as a collaboration between myself, the mechanical engineer as well as the factory.
Our minimum quantity that will allow us to bring the Portalift to life comes to about 100 units and  we are silently optimistic about getting funding for this many units.
However, we will still go ahead even if we don't fully reach our goal. 
The factory will charge us slightly more per unit to produce less than 100 units, and even if we just have to break even we are committed to ship the product to everyone who has funded us.
Should we not reach the funding goal, we will still produce units for everyone who has contributed, and we believe that having a professionally manufactured product to showcase will assist us to raise the rest of the required funds necessary for getting the Portalift into mobility equipment stores on a wide enough scale for it to be available to those who may need it.
We are confident that we can bring the Portalift to life within 90 days from the end of the crowdfunding campaign, and if there are any delays we will be updating all our contributors. We do not foresee this though as most of the crucial landmarks in the development of the product have already been completed.
   The Impact

As mentioned in my appeal video above, the need that mobility impaired individuals have for a solution that will allow them to almost effortlessly lift their wheelchairs and mobility scooters into a car is dire.
Again and again my sympathies have been stirred as I have come across dozens of individuals who need help, disabled mothers who need all the help they can get to raise their families, mobility impaired fathers for whom portable mobility will provide a new sense of self-esteem and empowerment to get the job done of being a dad.
We have many parents who struggle to provide their disabled kids with the ability to interact with the world, simply because most electric wheelchairs are too heavy.For the same reason, we have the disgrace of thousands of aged parents stuck between four walls in dank apartments and lonely nursing homes because of the inability to get around easily.
Coming up with this wheelchair lift is not a big ask. Your contribution will make it a reality, and the result will be that we add an untold amount of happiness and joy to the lives of those who are holding out for an easy solution that will give them portable mobility.
As mentioned before, I am not an engineer but have brought a whole number of innovations to life, specifically for the sake of making life easier for the mobility impaired.
Among the innovations, we have developed a carer arm to steer and power our wheelchairs by simply walking behind it.
We have also developed the sliding brackets required to easily disassemble our wheelchairs into three easy to lift parts. This innovation alone has been responsible for giving many of our clients the ability to lift the wheelchair into the car by themselves, or, at least empowering their caregivers with this ability.
We are also busy bringing a number of other mobility innovations to life, all of them related to providing our clients with portable mobility solutions.Until now, we have manufactured these innovations in our own workshop, and the high cost of producing these one by one has been a major obstacle towards commercialization of our innovations. 
We know that with your support  we can bring these innovations to life and provide the solutions that will help many people with mobility impairments live a much happier life. Thanks.
Risks & Challenges   
Our biggest challenge is to come up with a design friendly enough to make it sufficiently easy for even those with heavily impaired dexterity to use the Portalift . Ease of use and friendliness will be our main design brief, and to this end, we have identified the most creative and accomplished engineers for the design task.
We will be focusing on simplicity above all, with failsafe easy to use features for deploying the Portalift .
With the engineers we have identified, and having carefully studied their portfolios and currently successful mechanical designs for similar gadgets, we are convinced that we will bring to market a game-changing device for the mobility impaired.
Our other challenge for this project was to come up with a solution that would bypass the strict requirements for shipping lithium iron batteries. 
We have overcome this by using standard 9 V batteries that are not only highly affordable and available everywhere, but which also come in rechargeable format so as to contain the costs of operating the Portalift .
The unit operates on voltages ranging from 20 V right up to 29 V, and therefore it is possible for you to  use a standard 20v portable electric screwdriver battery pack available from ebay or your local hardware store.
   Other Ways You Can Help 
We believe there are many individuals who would love to help and donate, but who would appreciate getting something tangible in return.
For this reason, we have identified some of the most desirable gadgets available and are offering them at steep discounts for those who would like to contribute whilst getting something tangible and useful in return.
You will see that we have listed some very useful gadgets for those who suffer from physical disability. 
We have also listed some amazing rewards for those who want something useful for the kitchen, the workshop, and for those looking for useful gadgets for their mobile phones or tablets.
Shipping cost will be calculated according to the address, and will simply be a disbursement without any further costs added.
We will ship internationally using the least expensive option, and contributors will also be given the opportunity to select receiving their rewards via express Courier.
Once again, we are extremely grateful for any contributions you can make, and it will go a long way towards helping to make the Portalift a reality for thousands and thousands of individuals worldwide.",0.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h4><b>What is Ged-I?</b></h4>
<p>Ged-I (short for GEDCOM Interpreter) is an
innovative genealogy software that will help you find your ancestors faster by

<h4><b>How Ged-I came to be:</b></h4>
<p>Lorne, founder of Logíque, has been doing
genealogy since he was a teen. Genealogy establishes a human connection between
ourselves and those who came before us. When we connect with the dead, it helps
us become closer to the living as well.</p>
<p>On top of helping us connect one another to our
pasts, genealogy teaches us where we come from. It’s an attempt to answer the
age old question of “who am I?”</p>
<p>Lorne’s family heritage came from nobility who
had everything stripped from them. But instead of letting that keep them down,
they decided to start fresh in America. While doing genealogy work, Lorne found
out that he comes from a family of survivors and knowing that inspires him to
push on despite the challenges that come his way. </p>
<p>Family stories like this are “Eureka!” moments
of genealogy, and Logíque wants to help other genealogists find these
moments of inspiration.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>“If you
could have a prescription drug to make your life better, there could not be a
prescription drug better, in any sense of the word, than doing genealogy”. ~
Lorne </b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>In doing his own genealogy work, Lorne came
across two large tomes packed with information on thousands of ancestors. He
tried enter the data by hand, but it quickly became overwhelming. After a bit
of math, he realized that manually keying in all of the entries would take him
over a year to complete.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>“I've got
a lifetime of work here ahead of me. How in the world am I going to survive
researching this stuff without some kind of tool?” ~Lorne</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Ged-I is the way to drastically reduce the
amount of time that cataloging all of this information by hand currently takes.
This tool will help thousands of genealogists, like Lorne, who need a more
efficient way to archive invaluable information about their ancestors. </p>
<p>None of this can happen without your help.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>While Anu™ Clean Cup is the ONLY menstrual cup that absorbs, it's also the only menstrual cup that has the option of choosing an applicator.  Relax. It's much easier to insert Anu™ Clean Cup when you're relaxed. </p><p>Inserting is much like inserting a tampon and usually takes a few tries before
being able to comfortably insert so don't worry. Refer to the instructions and diagrams so you
know what to do.</p><p><span>Anu™ Clean Cup w/
applicator is
actually made up of 2 parts – the cup itself that you insert into your body,
and the applicator you use to insert it. The applicator has a smooth
tapered barrel that contains the Anu™ Clean Cup within it, attached is a smaller tube below the cup called a
plunger.</span></p><p><span>1. Wash your hands and then unwrap the Anu™ Clean Cup.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>2. Get comfortable. Try sitting on the toilet with knees apart or standing with
one foot on the toilet seat.</span></p><p>
3. Insert the applicator: hold the applicator plunger using your thumb and
middle finger. Place the applicator tip into your vagina parallel to the floor at
a 45˚ angle. Now, gently slide the smooth, tapered applicator all the way into
your vagina until your fingers touch your body.</p>
<br/>
4. Push the Anu™ Clean Cup inside: push the
plunger all the way into the barrel with your pointer finger. This will release
the Anu™ Clean Cup. The plunger should
now be inside the barrel. Still holding the plunger, gently pull out the
two-piece applicator. The Anu™
Clean Cup

being able to comfortably insert so don't worry. Refer to the instructions and diagrams so you
know what to do.Anu™ Clean Cup w/
applicator is
actually made up of 2 parts – the cup itself that you insert into your body,
and the applicator you use to insert it. The applicator has a smooth
tapered barrel that contains the Anu™ Clean Cup within it, attached is a smaller tube below the cup called a
plunger.1. Wash your hands and then unwrap the Anu™ Clean Cup.2. Get comfortable. Try sitting on the toilet with knees apart or standing with
one foot on the toilet seat.
3. Insert the applicator: hold the applicator plunger using your thumb and
middle finger. Place the applicator tip into your vagina parallel to the floor at
a 45˚ angle. Now, gently slide the smooth, tapered applicator all the way into
your vagina until your fingers touch your body.

4. Push the Anu™ Clean Cup inside: push the
plunger all the way into the barrel with your pointer finger. This will release
the Anu™ Clean Cup. The plunger should
now be inside the barrel. Still holding the plunger, gently pull out the
two-piece applicator. The Anu™
Clean Cup
should now be comfortably inside you in its precise place.

                                      

After you have inserted the Anu™
Clean Cup,
place the used applicator back into the discreet wrapper and throw away. DO NOT
FLUSH THE APPLICATOR.

</div></div>","THANK YOU!   ALTHOUGH the total on our page says $45,712.00 - one day after the campaign closed, we calculated all donations during our Indiegogo raise, including #GivingTuesday, and Black Friday and even Cyber Monday!  The grand total was $52,000!   WELL DONE! WE MADE IT!THANK YOU SO VERY, VERY MUCH!!!              “You have changed our lives….. no, you have saved our lives.”Written by May, the mother of 2 young boys whose story we share below. Here are just some of the reasons Angel Flight West has to exist:Meet Macy H., she is only a year old and has already flown on 9 Angel Flights with us.  Macy suffers with glaucoma and has to fly from Great Falls, MT to Spokane WA for treatment. These flights are not just for her, but for her family too. Often, bringing friends and relatives with passengers is the key component to a patient's recovery.  Macy is able to receive specialized care because of Angel Flight West, without us, would not be able to access it.  We're so happy we can be there for her and her family and for other children with similar medical needs.  We're able to do that for Macy, because of your kind donations to us.It seems like it might be an intense trip to Macy (above), but for Solomon and Justice (below) who are on their way back from treatment, it can be a pure delight!  There can be genuine excitement and happiness involved in a private flight to and from treatment - so much so it sometimes makes our children forget their ailments! Solomon and Justice are listening in to on their pilot's conversation in this shot!  It's your donations and generosity that keep all this possible, and we thank you.While Angel Flight West has been helping all manner of people in need since 1983, our current campaign is focused on some of our strongest patients- children battling severe medical conditions.  These are our littlest warriors, whose families would otherwise be unable to get their children the care they need. Angel Flight West is a grassroots, volunteer driven, non-profit.  We are based at the Santa Monica Airport, and since 1983 we've worked with a growing list of awesome pilots (currently 1600+) and dedicated ground staff (we call them earth angels!) who volunteer their time and airplanes to fly sick patients to treatment.  Currently a third of our patients are children, and in 2016 we want to help more.....       Passengers, Deeb and Zaid H., below, need to fly to treatment frequently (their story is below).   With your support, either by donating or equally as important, by sharing our campaign with your friends, we can add 250 flights next year for families like Deeb and Zaid's and with this campaign, we can already say that for sure we've added 118 ... and counting! To share our campaign with your friends, just cut and paste this link into your email correspondence with a small note of encouragement: http://igg.me/at/AFW2015                     Not your average passenger, not your average pilots! 
AFW Pilot Michael McDonald with Deeb and Zaid before leaving for treatment.Brothers Deeb H., 16, and Zaid, H., 12, were diagnosed at birth with epidermolysis bullosa. Known as
EB, this rare disease causes the skin to blister in response to almost any
contact, such as friction and heat. Severe cases mean the blisters also form
and grow inside the body. Currently, there is no cure. Treatment aims to offer some
measure of relief from symptoms by combatting infection and itching, but EB
cannot be reversed and is fatal when severe. May, the mother of Deeb and Zaid, was commuting from Visalia
to Stanford 3 days in a row each week for medical relief for her sons. Long
arduous car rides meant hours of pain from seatbelts and taxing exhaustion from
travelling. While there is no way to halt the suffering inflicted on
these young boys, Angel Flight West stepped in to provide relief and hope for a
more painless route to treatment.
Taking care of her boys is a full-time job for May, and we
feel as grateful as her for the honor of stepping in to improve the lives of
these children:
“You have changed our lives….. no, you have saved our lives.”
You can see how quickly our flights are used up with even one or two children in need.  Please give generously this Thanksgiving Holiday and help us, help families struggling with children in need.
A message from Olivia and Isabel, Angel Flight West's newest additions!



Remember Mason from last year?   He was in a very painful place when we first met him to fly him to his Kidney dialysis treatment three times a week - and now that he has found a kidney replacement, look at how well he's doing.  He made this Thank You video specially for our Indiegogo campaign to show how your generous donations make a lifelong impact to our children:

   It's patients like Mason that make our work so meaningful to us, and we are making it our mission to increase the number of success stories we get to share with you!

Our Executive Director, Josh Olson, Introduces our 2nd Annual Indiegogo launch video - and offers up a very UNIQUE perk - to embarrass him!  Check it out and whatever you can come up with, if he accepts it - we'll film it, and post it here! Talk about a dedicated Executive Director!
This year, we were given $10,000 of matching funds by our Board Chair, Steve Danz.  So for
every $1 you donated, Steve donated $1 - up to $10,000! AND WE MANAGED TO SPEND IT ALL!  But we still need the donations to keep coming in.
Did you know that not all of our flights are serious medical emergencies, sometimes they are morale boosters.  Pictured below with Trevin A. and Ariella, Elian, & Alona Z. is Angel Flight West's Board Chair and Command Pilot, Steve Danz who flew them to and from a special camp for deaf and hearing impaired children in Mariposa, CA where they could play with other deaf and hearing impaired kids just like them creating memories to last a lifetime!   

 
Remember Mason? 
If you were one of our donors last year, you'll remember our young passenger, Mason, who was suffering with a debilitating kidney disease.  Mason was having to be shuttled back and forth to kidney dialysis, two hours away, three
times a week. With the money we raised in our Indiegogo last year, we were able to help Mason fly to complete all his treatments until a kidney
donor was found for his transplant.

Check out Mason in the hospital before his transplant above left, and on the right, back to doing all the things a child should be able to do-like go to school!

It's a disorder that requires constant treatment - treatment that's not available in Redding, California, where Catherine lives.  So with AFW as their airline, she and her mother travel to and from Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in Palo Alto.  Since 2013, Catherine has flown over 15 round-trip flights with AFW - all due to your generous support of our efforts to help as many passengers like Catherine as we possibly can.

<p><strong>What is Psykhe? </strong></p>
<p>Psykhe is a social enterprise that strives to increase access to mental health treatment by ending the time-consuming burden on college students of seeking long-term therapy. Through data driven matching, the intuitive online platform equips students with therapists who fit their needs, giving them the resources to begin mental health therapy, and paving a healthier and happier college lifestyle for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Our Founding Story</strong></p>
<p>Dealing with a mental illness while performing the full-time responsibilities of a college student can be extremely difficult. Mental illness affects one's ability to function on a daily basis and many students don't seek any help. Founder, Mansi Parikh, noticed how mental illness affected those close to her. Her own experiences with finding a therapist and the stories of many peers inspired her to found a venture that works to make mental health treatment more accessible amongst students.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Psykhe strives to increase access to mental health care for college students, specifically those seeking long-term therapy, by tackling the root problems for lack of access to mental health care. Psykhe reduces the time-consuming, burdensome nature of finding a good therapist, allowing students to take the first step to seeking help and bringing stability and happiness into the lives of college students. </p>

<h3>We're committed to better health care. </h3>
<p>CaRessa Hutchinson, a registered nurse, is a founder and serves as CEO of ModRN Health. Scott Roethle, a physician, is co-founder and President of ModRN Health.</p>
<p>ModRN Health's founders share a deep personal commitment to helping people navigate the healthcare system. ""Every patient counts,"" CaRessa frequently says. ""No one should fall through the cracks.""</p>
<p>Your support of ModRN Health's Launch Campaign will help CaRessa and Scott reach more people, faster, by scaling the platform's technology and hiring more nurses. </p>
<p>""I saw families making major, life-altering decisions without the proper education and support to understand the weight of their decisions,"" said CaRessa. ""Overworked nurses could no longer focus on patient advocacy, and over-loaded physicians were being forced to make decisions based on assumptions, inaccurate information, insurance, and bureaucracy; not based on people, as they had once dreamed of doing when they committed their lives to becoming healers. It started to feel like I was watching one very large and very dangerous game of telephone, but with real lives depending on the results.""</p>
<p>Scott had observed very similar trends and shares CaRessa's concern. ""I see the perils of our industry's sick-care model on a daily basis,"" Scott said. ""And I know there is a better way to care for people and optimize their health by focusing on the right things, not just prescribing more medications or performing procedures. We engage patients along their healthcare journey so they live a healthy life, preventing diseases and improving underlying chronic conditions."" </p>
<p>Through the ModRN Health solution, Scott says, ""we take better care of people.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's what we need.</h3>
<p>Through this campaign, ModRN Health is seeking at least $50,000. We need the funds to add new features to our technology, including enhancements to a personal health record and more messaging capabilities for members on the platform to contact their nurse coordinator. We also are developing tools that help the employers--our customers--demonstrate that ModRN Health is a valuable employee benefit. Every dollar counts as we scale our company. Your support will be put to good use, even if we don't hit our goal.</p>
<h3>And here's what you get.</h3>
<p>This campaign lets you take advantage of early bird pricing discounts for individual, family, and employer memberships to the ModRN Health solution.</p>
<p>The perks you get when you fund our campaign are as good for you as they are for us! We want as many people as possible to experience the power of ModRN Health, in the palm of their hands.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unsure whether you need to contact your primary care physician with a follow-up question?</li>
<li>Wondering where's the best pharmacy to fill a new prescription?</li>
<li>Need a few pointers about how to get a better night's sleep?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all questions that can be answered by the care coordination team and patient advocates available to you through the ModRN Health app. Through our technology, you'll be paired with a member of ModRN Health's nurse coordination team who stays with you for the long term. By getting to know you and your personal health journey, ModRN Health's dedicated resources offer even better care coordination as time goes by. </p>
<p>For employers, the ModRN Health solution is exciting because it works alongside existing health plans and programs by combining technology with personalized, nurse-led healthcare management, This lowers costs and makes it easier for people to get healthy. It's a great perk for employees. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We're up to the challenge! </h3>
<p>We founded ModRN Health in 2015 and bootstrapped it until now. This campaign coincides with the launch of our first beta customers. The campaign is our first outside fundraising effort. We've designed the campaign to both raise funds and get users on our platform at the same time. That's the best way for us to grow and learn.  </p>
<p>We know it's hard to build a successful SaaS company. For the past three years, we’ve used our personal funds to develop our technology platform and our implementation systems. We’ve also built a loyal following of people who are excited about our progress. We're thrilled to invite our friends to support us as we scale.</p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We welcome your enthusiasm.</span></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If financial support isn't right for you, there are still plenty of ways you can help ModRN Health grow. </span></p>

Scott had observed very similar trends and shares CaRessa's concern. ""I see the perils of our industry's sick-care model on a daily basis,"" Scott said. ""And I know there is a better way to care for people and optimize their health by focusing on the right things, not just prescribing more medications or performing procedures. We engage patients along their healthcare journey so they live a healthy life, preventing diseases and improving underlying chronic conditions."" 
Through the ModRN Health solution, Scott says, ""we take better care of people.""

Here's what we need.
Through this campaign, ModRN Health is seeking at least $50,000. We need the funds to add new features to our technology, including enhancements to a personal health record and more messaging capabilities for members on the platform to contact their nurse coordinator. We also are developing tools that help the employers--our customers--demonstrate that ModRN Health is a valuable employee benefit. Every dollar counts as we scale our company. Your support will be put to good use, even if we don't hit our goal.
And here's what you get.
This campaign lets you take advantage of early bird pricing discounts for individual, family, and employer memberships to the ModRN Health solution.
The perks you get when you fund our campaign are as good for you as they are for us! We want as many people as possible to experience the power of ModRN Health, in the palm of their hands.

Unsure whether you need to contact your primary care physician with a follow-up question?
Wondering where's the best pharmacy to fill a new prescription?
Need a few pointers about how to get a better night's sleep?

These are all questions that can be answered by the care coordination team and patient advocates available to you through the ModRN Health app. Through our technology, you'll be paired with a member of ModRN Health's nurse coordination team who stays with you for the long term. By getting to know you and your personal health journey, ModRN Health's dedicated resources offer even better care coordination as time goes by. 
For employers, the ModRN Health solution is exciting because it works alongside existing health plans and programs by combining technology with personalized, nurse-led healthcare management, This lowers costs and makes it easier for people to get healthy. It's a great perk for employees. 

We're up to the challenge! 
We founded ModRN Health in 2015 and bootstrapped it until now. This campaign coincides with the launch of our first beta customers. The campaign is our first outside fundraising effort. We've designed the campaign to both raise funds and get users on our platform at the same time. That's the best way for us to grow and learn.  
We know it's hard to build a successful SaaS company. For the past three years, we’ve used our personal funds to develop our technology platform and our implementation systems. We’ve also built a loyal following of people who are excited about our progress. We're thrilled to invite our friends to support us as we scale.
We welcome your enthusiasm.
If financial support isn't right for you, there are still plenty of ways you can help ModRN Health grow. 

Follow us on social media and share our posts. Find us on Twitter @ModRNHealth, on LinkedIn, and Facebook.

<h3>The perfect, hygienic solution to clean between your 'cheeks' - Wash cloth &amp; pouf bacteria be gone! </h3>
<p>Have you ever cringed at the thought of using the same wash cloth or pouf to clean both your body and your butt? Your answer is probably yes, because using them for dual purposes is just, well...<i>gross</i>. We've been working on a clever solution for quite some time, and we couldn't be prouder to present CHEEKY.</p>
<p>Exclusive to your derrière, <strong>CHEEKY </strong>changes the way you wash your butt for a more hygienic and pleasant bath or shower experience. Sleek, classy and totally convenient, CHEEKY's disposable sponge can be replaced as often as you wish giving you a more safe and <i>sanitary</i> clean ""in between."" We've taken a new, innovative and practical approach to an everyday problem and created a very <strong>simple &amp; easy solution </strong>that can be effortlessly incorporated into your bath/shower routine. Spreading booty bacteria (from a wash cloth or pouf) all over your body is a thing of the past, <strong>CHEEKY</strong> puts it all <i>behind </i>you where it belongs. </p>

<p>I'm sure some of you reading this keep those pouf things around forever, and the stale wash cloths for more than a day--you know who you are. No worries, we've got your back--literally. Maybe you've never even given that much thought to it and that's OK too. There's no time like now to <strong>enhance your hygiene routine</strong>. When we know better, we do better. Making this small tweak to the way you shower and bathe can<strong> positively impact your health</strong>. With <strong>CHEEKY</strong>, you have that extra comfort knowing that the fecal matter and e. coli remnants hanging out between your <i>cheeks</i> have less of a chance to make it's way to your urinary tract and other areas of your body. </p>
<p><strong>There's a lot going on in our nether region </strong>that we should take more seriously. Bacteria lives there in the folds, creases and crevices until we scrub it clean. When we do wash it, that fecal matter remains on our wash cloth or pouf which can be spread to other parts of our body. It's not rocket science--just pure, raw facts. That's why we need <strong>CHEEKY</strong>, our butt's very own designated scrubber, to ensure we wash up clean and sanitary and to avoid <strong>spreading bacteria</strong> all over our body. (<i>By the way, you probably don't even remember when you bought that pouf or how long it's been hanging in your shower...right?</i>)</p>

<p>So there I was, all bubbled up and soaking in my luxurious bath...lavishing in my in favorite sugar scrub and body wash...basking in my calgon, take me away-like moment. Then it happened--time to start washing my intimate parts. I looked up at the pink pouf thing dangling by its string, then I froze, giving it a blank stare....thinking to myself OMG I just washed my butt with that yesterday! After going back/forth in my head about the gross thought of THAT, and contemplating whether or not I should use it on my body, I hesitantly proceeded to do the ""wash of shame."" With each and every wipe, I grew more and more disgusted. And there went my blissful bath time experience...right down the drain.</p>

<p><strong>The first day with a fresh cloth or brand new pouf is no problem</strong>--just simply wash my front first and my bottom last. Possibly even a second day (with the pouf)--but not without fully dissecting it like a science project and wrecking my brain trying to decipher which side of it I used to wash my butt with last. Gotta make sure I don't use the wrong side on my vajayjay. But when that 3rd day rolls around, I get really uncomfortable--and no way I'm using the same wash cloth, period! The thought of all that bacteria lingering around makes me VERY uncomfortable. Surely you can relate...</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543527399/eg7jwbrfoqq3jxzphwxb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Thinking that I might be a bit anal about this situation</strong>, I asked my hubby what he thought about my little ""problem."" He did agree that he gets a bit uncomfortable using the same wash cloth/sponge for his body and backside. If <i>he</i> felt uncomfortable (being the manly man that he is), I thought about all the other men (<i>and women of course</i>) that probably felt the same way.</p>
<p>Fed up with going through my bath time crisis every day, and more importantly tired of worrying about the effect it could potentially have on my health and hygiene,<strong> </strong>I <strong>had to find a <i>practical </i>solution</strong>. Because who wants to bring two and three wash cloths to the bath or shower, <i>right</i>? And who has time for all that extra laundry anyway? Even worse, who wants all those butt rags piling up in their hamper until wash day...<i>whenever that is</i>? I began to think of ideas, visualizing what I could (<i>conveniently)</i> do to clean between my cheeks and my body separately. Aha! A disposable sponge used exclusively for my butt...that can be discarded and replaced as often as I wish--perfect! And that's how <strong>CHEEKY</strong> was born. We've vetted and solidified a top notch manufacturer who shares the same high standards that we do, to ensure CHEEKY is made with the utmost quality so we can jump start production for you.</p>

If you had the opportunity to view our entire campaign, you can see we've put a lot of time, effort and devotion into developing CHEEKY; and with your help and support, we'll be able to get CHEEKY into your hands and others around the world, so everyone can benefit from a more healthier way of living. 
 

  
 

   FAQ'SQ. Can CHEEKY be used on other areas of the body?A. Yes, however it's design and recommended usage is for your butt, to prevent the spread of bacteria from your backside to other parts of your body.Q. Does CHEEKY need batteries?A. No, it's not electric.Q. Is CHEEKY heavy or really big?A. CHEEKY is lightweight, super sleek, and designed to fit very comfortably in your hand.Q. How often should I change the sponge?A. Since CHEEKY's intended use is for your backside only, we recommend replacing the sponge at least every 3-4 weeks, butt...you can replace it as often as you wish.Q. Does CHEEKY fit between your cheeks?A. Absolutely, CHEEKY is very slim. But just like washing your butt with a wash cloth or pouf thing, you still may need to spread your cheeks a bit for a thorough and detailed cleanse.Q. How do I pick my color?A. We will send you an email after the campaign, and at that time, you'll be asked to choose your favorite color(s).Q. How does CHEEKY work?A. Simple. Insert running water into CHEEKY, pour your favorite bath/shower gel onto the sponge, clean between your cheeks, then press the button to rinse off the soap & impurities from between your cheeks. Repeat as necessary.Q. Do I have to put water into CHEEKY?A. Not at all. Only if you want to use the super cool & convenient rinse feature. If you prefer, you can use CHEEKY just to scrub and clean between your cheeks, and if you already have one of those handheld shower heads, you can use that to rinse your butt (if it's long enough to reach back there)...or you can take up yoga and have the water pour straight from the tub faucet into your behind (just kidding). OR, you can simply use CHEEKY for all your cleansing and rinsing needs.Q. Can I use CHEEKY just as a bidet?A. Of course! CHEEKY works awesome as a portable bidet if you just want a good rinsing back there, or if you want to soothe the area for whatever reason.Q. I want to order a large quantity of CHEEKY's. Can you provide us with any discounts?A. We sure can! Just send us a message with the color(s) and the quantity and we will get back to you with our discounted pricing and details on how to pledge.",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

In addition, she began educating people about the benefits of natural vitamins, herbs, and minerals. Through her research of drugs and new therapies in the pharmaceutical industry, she was able to discover new natural remedies to relieve symptoms, without the harmful side effects.  In a fast-paced world, men feel stressed and under immense pressure from work and life commitments.  Men tend to feel that conditions which are not life threatening do not need medical attention, not understanding that these conditions, if ignored, may actually worsen over a period of time.  Some common conditions are weak sex drive, decrease libido, muscle cramps especially in the lower back and kidney areas, night urinations and insomnia.M100 is a male enhancement drug for those seeking to reach the peak of their energy. While many products claim similar benefits, M100 is produced with a proprietary formula using 100% organic herbal ingredients. It is a supplement in the market with male enhancing properties, and also helps with frequent nighttime urination problem.

<p>Since the team's founding in 2013, Valhalla has worked tirelessly to foster the growth of quidditch in Canada. We're proud to have athletes involved in every level of Quidditch Canada: from referees to snitches to volunteers to Executive Board directors, Valhalla is committed to putting in the work necessary to help our sport develop; and we know that work includes travelling to major tournaments. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let's be real: there's not a lot of money in quidditch. As a community team, we don't get any support from schools, and we're a bunch of young professionals who decided to live in a big city, pay big city rent, and fly across a <strong><i>really big country</i></strong>. We need all the help we can get!</p>
<p>Our campaign goal of <strong>$3500</strong> will cover all our athletes' non-travel expenses: keeping them fed, housed, and ready to play at nationals. Anything beyond that will go toward subsidizing airfare for athletes who may not otherwise be able to afford the trip. In exchange, you'll get some sweet limited edition Valhalla merch! Also our unending gratitude, but let's be real, the merch is the best part. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Some of our players have been around since the dawn of quidditch in Canada. Having played before and through the IQA split, <strong>we've seen the remarkable growth that comes to the sport when its top teams come together to compete.</strong> We're excited about the opportunity to bring our team out west for the first time, and we can't wait to face some new teams!</p>

Women Empowering Women TrimTribe is a sisterhood of women empowering women. We start with a ""28 Day Body Makeover Challenge""™ where women lose up to 16 inches of fat in just 28 short days!Best of all, they feel more energy and happiness than ever before.Unlike crash dieting that leaves you week, irritable and drained, the TrimTribe approach gives you energy, focus and happiness because it works with the natural healing mechanisms in your body. 
What We Need And What You Get...The women in TrimTribe are asking for an app that they can download on their phone to take TrimTribe with them everywhere. The cost to develop the app is $60,000. Your contribution (in whatever you can afford) will help to bring this technology out to the millions of women who are struggling to lose weight right now. 
Risks And ChallengesI've been in the weight loss industry since 2006, and it is highly competitive. We need to develop this app as soon as possible. Traditional advertising has been hard for me to get this out there because unfortunately, there are a lot of scams in the weight loss industry. I have dedicated my life to helping as many women as I can to learn the truth about how to look out for these scams, and only trust people who are giving 100% honest advice. I want them to make healthy choices so that weight comes off naturally. 
The Future Needs Us... I dream of a world where young girls growing up in the future will not hate their bodies or struggle with body image. I dream of a world where they don’t even know what the word “diet” means. I need your help. The women need your help. The young girls who will become our future need your help. TrimTribe is the support they need to stop the destructive yo-yo dieting and reveal the true health they deserve. Please share this message with your social networks, and help to get the word out.Thank you for your contribution.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>Becoming a qualified <strong>Nordic walking instructor</strong>. <ul>
<li>Why? <p>Nordic Walking is a fun, social and effective way to be active. Is the gym not your scene? Is jogging too tough on your body? Is walking not tough enough? Do you find swimming too solitary? Well then you have come to the right place! Nordic Walking is as effective as jogging, as gentle as walking and it is perfect to do with a group of old and new friends. Because Nordic Walking uses poles it engages your whole body and works all your major muscles from head to toe. The result is an effective, easy and fun exercise that can be enjoyed by almost everyone - any age, any athletic ability.</p>
<p>Up to a 40% increase in calorie burn at a lower rate of perceived exertion is just one of the health benefits of Nordic Walking.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Burn more calories in less time<br/>Consumes approximately 400 calories per hour (compared with 280 calories per hour for normal walking)<br/>Energy consumption increases when using poles by an average of 20% compared with ordinary walking without poles<br/>Heart rate is 5-17 beats per minute higher.<br/>Up to a 40% increase in energy consumption (Cooper Institute research, Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sports 2002 publication)<br/>Low rate of perceived exertion &amp; easy to master<br/>A total body activity<br/>The lateral mobility of the neck and spine increases significantly<br/>The muscles most actively involved are the forearm extensor and flexor muscles, biceps, triceps, the rear part of the shoulder muscles, the large pectoral muscles, chest, abdominals, back muscles, and your butt!<br/>Reduced load and relaxed muscles<br/>Does not aggravate joints and knees.<br/>Reduces the load on knees and other joints. Improves balance and co-ordination<br/>Releases pain and muscle tension in the neck/shoulder region<br/>Poles are a safety factor on slippery surfaces<br/>Varied levels of intensity<br/>Energetic, Relaxing and Fun</p></li>

The more blood your heart pumps, the stronger your heart will get in time and the better blood fluidity will gain. And if you have a strong heart, you will have less risks for diseases, especially heart diseases.</p>
<p>Puts you in shape: Do you want to lose weight? Or just get fitter? Try an obstacle race! The constant running and intense force you apply to every obstacle will have you burning lots of calories, and eventually burn fat and lose weight. If you are bored with doing the some exercises and workouts, try an obstacle race! Never quit moving and exercising. Keep your body physically active at all times. Stay fit in a fun way!<br/><br/> </p>
<p>Fortify bones: With about 10 minutes of being outdoor, the sun activate the vitamin D in your body, which is the one the makes your bones dense and strong. Besides,  the high impact exercise stimulates an increase in bone mass so that the body in prepared to future impacts. Bone mass will increase faster in younger persons involved in high impact workouts, like adolescents, according to recently researchers at the University of Bristol.</p>
<p>Build strength and endurance: Climbing a walls, crawling under barb wires, holding onto ropes – these types of races will absolutely test your strength abilities and will make you push your physical limits. This way, on your next race, you would be able to keep going faster and farther than the previous time. You’ll even want to go for longer races to keep challenging your body.</p>
<p>Improve balance and coordination: Along the race, all the racers are trying to not fall down or trip maintaining their balance with every single obstacle. Always coordinating all your body parts, muscles and senses at the same time: looking up to see what obstacle is next or looking back to see how far you are from your friend; feeling the terrain with your feet and stabilize them if it’s rocky or muddy; moving your hands around to help you move faster and have them ready if you fall; jumping and trying to land strong with both feet – all of these movements correspond with your brain’s orders and making you improve you balance and coordination.<br/><br/>Toughens the brain: Before you attend to one of this events, not only you have to be physically prepared, but mentally too. Your brain is set to one goal: Finish the race! Focusing in accomplish that goal, your level of concentration on that race would be at the top of everything that is on your mind.</p>
<p>Make new friends – Obstacle courses tend to focus heavily on teamwork and cooperation, and while it’s not required to create a team, you will eventually find many mud runners who are willing to help each other out. These kind of races bring people together, from reaching out an arm on a half-pipe climb to climbing onto of each other to scale ridiculous height, you will make tons of friends doing this. While these courses are called “races,” the cooperation is high – even among strangers – add you build irreplaceable bonds.<br/><br/>Have fun – There is nothing more exiting than participating in an adventure that is not on your everyday routine. Going out there, running through various obstacles and getting muddy can be outrageously fun. You may fail some obstacles and your muscles may be intensely sore the next day but you will be taking on these challenges with an intense smile and having a great time.<br/><br/>Even <i><u><strong>American pediatricians and the Australia teaching curriculum </strong></u></i>are encouraging more physical activities in children. <a href=""http://nspt4kids.com/parenting/obstacle-courses-are-functional/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://nspt4kids.com/parenting/obstacle-courses...</a> and  <i><u><strong>Outcome 3—Children have a strong sense of wellbeing</strong></u></i></p>

Becoming a qualified Nordic walking instructor. 
Why? Nordic Walking is a fun, social and effective way to be active. Is the gym not your scene? Is jogging too tough on your body? Is walking not tough enough? Do you find swimming too solitary? Well then you have come to the right place! Nordic Walking is as effective as jogging, as gentle as walking and it is perfect to do with a group of old and new friends. Because Nordic Walking uses poles it engages your whole body and works all your major muscles from head to toe. The result is an effective, easy and fun exercise that can be enjoyed by almost everyone - any age, any athletic ability.
Up to a 40% increase in calorie burn at a lower rate of perceived exertion is just one of the health benefits of Nordic Walking.

Burn more calories in less timeConsumes approximately 400 calories per hour (compared with 280 calories per hour for normal walking)Energy consumption increases when using poles by an average of 20% compared with ordinary walking without polesHeart rate is 5-17 beats per minute higher.Up to a 40% increase in energy consumption (Cooper Institute research, Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sports 2002 publication)Low rate of perceived exertion & easy to masterA total body activityThe lateral mobility of the neck and spine increases significantlyThe muscles most actively involved are the forearm extensor and flexor muscles, biceps, triceps, the rear part of the shoulder muscles, the large pectoral muscles, chest, abdominals, back muscles, and your butt!Reduced load and relaxed musclesDoes not aggravate joints and knees.Reduces the load on knees and other joints. Improves balance and co-ordinationReleases pain and muscle tension in the neck/shoulder regionPoles are a safety factor on slippery surfacesVaried levels of intensityEnergetic, Relaxing and Fun

Main Street, across from the beautiful community Plaza in the heart of downtown. It comes with some revitalization work to be sure, which forms part of the need-basis for this campaign: the building needs a new ADA bathroom downstairs, and new Title 24 electrical throughout the building, a $50000 price tag in addition to our other build-out, start-up and staffing costs.</p><p>Our Yoga studio, named Watsonville Yoga, Dance and Healing Arts, comes to downtown at a time ripe with anticipation and a warmly extended invitation by the City for change and progress specific to the downtown area. This change, so long in coming, could only be of the kind that reflects the unique cultural identity of Watsonville and its’ people.</p><p>I have been touched over and over by the kindness in our community, and the defining spirit that of value on the family/familia: from parents I speak to in the parks while our children play, to the gentle abuelas and abuelos who stop to interact with my children, give them treats, and touch their heads with a smile. It is because of the richness I feel here that I want to be able to give back to our community in this project, our own much needed dedicated Yoga studio and world dance studio-- with bilingual classes to connect the community inclusively to the creative, peace-of-mind-enhancing and socially uniting practices of Yoga along with the joy and cultural traditions of world dance taught by leading teachers in their art.</p><p>I have, in the past, taught bilingual Yoga classes in Watsonville and Aptos at various Mid Pen Housing sites for a largely migrant population, who I grew to know intimately. I primarily served the communities at these sites with academic tutoring, but I also orchestrated meetings with indigenous teachers for the children and adult residents of the community. I gained footing in bilingual skills thanks largely to the patience of this community of people who lovingly encouraged me. Part of the vision for this studio comes from the positive memory of the reception to those Yoga classes; how useful they were for the people doing backbreaking work in the fields, and the joy that children and young teens found in creative movement through Yoga.</p><p>Through my husband Tom May’s employment as a Science teacher at PV High and his work with youth leadership and ecology with WATCH / Monterey Bay Aquarium, I have also learned much about the needs of families in our town for healthy, culturally-grounded leadership opportunities for our youth, and the positive impact it returns to their families and to the relationship to the land which we all depend upon, live and work with as well.</p><p>I believe with all of my heart, likewise, in the capacity of Yoga to reveal the above qualities in a person. Cesar Chavez did too--he studied and took example from Yoga philosophy at the observation of “Mahatma” Mohandas K. Gandhi’s successful independence movement for India out of British colonial rule, and the improvements for the people which followed on personal and economic levels.</p><p>Watsonville Yoga, Dance and Healing Arts will both reflect the existing cultural heritages in Watsonville and continue to reach across cultures beyond our area in many ways. Yoga is steeped in it’s own culture from hereditary India, but is now practiced all over the world. The dance classes we will offer will be varied world dance taught by teachers who have lived in or studied at their artistic place of origin and are fluent in the language and indigenous musical traditions which stand beside the dance. Dance can be entertaining but has great personal value also as a cultural expression and personal means for joy, energy, discipline, and health. We have plans for ""Worldanz"" hip hop and global fusion for kids and adults, Middle Eastern / North African Bellydance, Brasilian Capoeira and Samba, and Ballet Folklorico, and are in the process of securing Mejica / Aztec dance and Salsa.</p><p>Yoga classes will be offered to everyone inclusively, with mostly bilingual teachers and a bilingual receptionist at the desk at all times. We will offer classes for every age, physical ability, and stylistic preference. Our staff and teachers are sought locally first.</p><p>Our tentative Yoga schedule includes classes in meditation, Iyengar-inspired Hatha Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Sivananda Yoga, Vinyasa Flow, Yin/ Restorative, Yoga for kids, and a Community by-donation class for the general public and one for Seniors.</p><p>We will also be partnering with local acupuncturists and massage therapists to have a wellness center during the low-use times in the studio.</p><p>Watsonville Yoga, Dance and Healing Arts will improve the quality of life for our community in so many ways.

It is because of the richness I feel here that I want to be able to give back to our community in this project, our own much needed dedicated Yoga studio and world dance studio-- with bilingual classes to connect the community inclusively to the creative, peace-of-mind-enhancing and socially uniting practices of Yoga along with the joy and cultural traditions of world dance taught by leading teachers in their art.I have, in the past, taught bilingual Yoga classes in Watsonville and Aptos at various Mid Pen Housing sites for a largely migrant population, who I grew to know intimately. I primarily served the communities at these sites with academic tutoring, but I also orchestrated meetings with indigenous teachers for the children and adult residents of the community. I gained footing in bilingual skills thanks largely to the patience of this community of people who lovingly encouraged me. Part of the vision for this studio comes from the positive memory of the reception to those Yoga classes; how useful they were for the people doing backbreaking work in the fields, and the joy that children and young teens found in creative movement through Yoga.Through my husband Tom May’s employment as a Science teacher at PV High and his work with youth leadership and ecology with WATCH / Monterey Bay Aquarium, I have also learned much about the needs of families in our town for healthy, culturally-grounded leadership opportunities for our youth, and the positive impact it returns to their families and to the relationship to the land which we all depend upon, live and work with as well.I believe with all of my heart, likewise, in the capacity of Yoga to reveal the above qualities in a person. Cesar Chavez did too--he studied and took example from Yoga philosophy at the observation of “Mahatma” Mohandas K. Gandhi’s successful independence movement for India out of British colonial rule, and the improvements for the people which followed on personal and economic levels.Watsonville Yoga, Dance and Healing Arts will both reflect the existing cultural heritages in Watsonville and continue to reach across cultures beyond our area in many ways. Yoga is steeped in it’s own culture from hereditary India, but is now practiced all over the world. The dance classes we will offer will be varied world dance taught by teachers who have lived in or studied at their artistic place of origin and are fluent in the language and indigenous musical traditions which stand beside the dance. Dance can be entertaining but has great personal value also as a cultural expression and personal means for joy, energy, discipline, and health. We have plans for ""Worldanz"" hip hop and global fusion for kids and adults, Middle Eastern / North African Bellydance, Brasilian Capoeira and Samba, and Ballet Folklorico, and are in the process of securing Mejica / Aztec dance and Salsa.Yoga classes will be offered to everyone inclusively, with mostly bilingual teachers and a bilingual receptionist at the desk at all times. We will offer classes for every age, physical ability, and stylistic preference. Our staff and teachers are sought locally first.Our tentative Yoga schedule includes classes in meditation, Iyengar-inspired Hatha Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Sivananda Yoga, Vinyasa Flow, Yin/ Restorative, Yoga for kids, and a Community by-donation class for the general public and one for Seniors.We will also be partnering with local acupuncturists and massage therapists to have a wellness center during the low-use times in the studio.Watsonville Yoga, Dance and Healing Arts will improve the quality of life for our community in so many ways.

</div></div>","Sports Bottle Revolutionized
Dual Drinking Modes / Hydration Monitoring / DPAT Algorithm

We always forget to drink water, whether in life or sports, and we drink when we feel thirsty. We hope Moikit Gene can be a product that helps you to build better hydration habits. It works as perfect as a conventional sports bottle, and it is a lot  better. Moikit Gene can record your water intake automatically, and the Moikit APP offers more hydration management features. Many health issues are caused by poor hydration habits, and that’s why we believe Moikit Gene can change this.




Dual Hydration Modes
Traditional sports bottles only allow people to drink via one of two method: sipping or through a straw. Moikit’s revolutionary SmartStraw™ technology breaks this limitation. No matter you are riding outdoors, jogging or working at home, Gene allows you to hydrate in comfort, regardless of your current activity.

Zephair™​ Hydration Monitoring
Gene features patented Zephair™ hydration tracking technology, which not only eliminates all conventional electronic internals within the bottle, but also improves the measurement accuracy up to ±5ml. This new technology allows Gene to be carried around like any other traditional sports bottles. Gene can be easily cleaned without worrying about deposition.

DPAT Hydration Tracking Algorithm
Proper hydration is essential to your daily workouts and trainings. Our DPAT hydration tracking algorithm calculates your body’s hydration needs based on your actual water intake, body weight, health condition and your daily exercises. It will determine when you need to hydrate during your workouts.

Real Time Display and Notification
Gene allows you to check your hydration data in real time and reminds you to drink water before your body dehydrates. Gene’s high quality LCD display is clearly visible even under bright sunlight.

Farewell to Leaks in Your Bag
The world’s most innovative safe lid lock. Simply spin it, and it will lock the lid completely. When your Gene is in your bag, there is no need to worry about the leakage.

BPA Free, Robust Bottle Design
Gene uses Tritan™ as the main material of the bottle, and will not release BPA or other harmful substances. It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and has become the designated material for infant products. Tritan™ gives Gene a firm surface. Gene’s body is strong and will not break even when hit by strong forces. Gene is stable regardless of your activity.

IPX6 Waterproof, Easy to Wash
Gene is designed to be waterproofed (IPX6). You may wash it regularly or use it rainy days.

Single Charge Lasts 25 Days
Gene has a 150mAh polymer lithium battery. Gene can be charged  via the micro USB port on the lid. A single charge lasts up to 25 days.

The Moikit APP
We developed the Moikit APP, and it is compatible with all Moikit smart hydration products. The Moikit APP allows you to view your hydration progress, analyzes your hydration habits and reminds you to hydrate .



Moikit SmartStraw™
Not all straw bottles are created equally. Introducing Moikit SmartStraw™, an innovated technology that allows you to drink in two ways: sipping and pouring. Therefore no matter you are riding outdoors, jogging or working at home, Gene allows you to hydrate in comfort, regardless of your current activity.

Moikit Zephair™
Knowing your daily hydration is important for your health, and the more accurate, the better. Moikit’s patented Zephair™ hydration tracking technology makes this happen. Zephair™’s highly accurate sensor has an error range of ±5ml (based on a daily water consumption of 100ml). It not only eliminates all traditional electronic internals within the bottle, but also improve the measurement accuracy.

Moikit Safe Lock™ 

Having a unlocked bottle in your bag can be nightmare. The conventional lock mechanism on the market will often malfunction and cause leakage;therefore, we revolutionize our lock design and let users say bye to leakage once for all.


Your Personal Hydration Coach
You can connect Gene with your smart devices, and all data will be automatically synchronized via Bluetooth. You can monitor your personal hydration data in the Moikit APP anytime and anywhere.

Hydrate in a Scientific Way
Gene calculates your hydration data with accurate DPAT algorithm and reminds you to drink water regularly. You can optimize your hydration habits by checking data every now and then. The data and graphs in the Moikit APP provide you detailed hydration analysis and you can set your hydration reminder accordingly (notification to drink water). It helps you to build better hydration habits.

Apple Health Compatibility
Hydration data can be synchronized and viewed in Apple Health.

Third Party APP Compatibility
Gene is not only compatible with the Moikit APP, the hydration data recorded by Gene can also be synchronized and viewed in Apple Health, Fitbit, and Jawbone UP.


Gene currently offers 3 colors and more colors will be available in the future.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m Pooja, the Founder of Begin to Heal and let me share with you my story on how holistic healing came into my life. For 14 years I’ve been a Strategy and Business Development Executive, working with Fortune 500 companies such as American Express, Microsoft, IBM, Wipro, and Pepsi. Although I enjoyed a nice living and felt invincible, due to my extreme worklife I developed adrenal fatigue in 2013, which made me completely reconsider my past way of life. After trying countless doctors from New York to India - without any meaningful improvement - I was finally introduced to the wondrous world of holistic healing, and this changed everything.</p>
<p>When I finally managed to get all of my strength back, I decided to dedicate my life to creating a premier online marketplace for holistic healing, and changing as many lives in the process as possible. Begin to Heal was born with the mission to help people find the best holistic health practitioners, and to be a trusted source in all holistic practices.</p>
<p>Begin to Heal is an online platform, your trusted source on Holistic Healing, where those in search of optimal health and wellness can book video, audio, or in-person sessions with a curated list of practitioners from across the country. Our list includes over 200 highly qualified professionals, M.D.s, keynote speakers in conferences and celebrated authors.</p>
<p>Begin to Heal is your trusted companion in your quest for a conscious lifestyle to help you discover the marvelous benefits of Holistic healing and to make it easy for you connect with the best practitioners and read reviews on them. You can even do these sessions from the comfort of your home, with practitioners from around the world, through our state-of-the-art video calling feature for many of our practices. Begin to Heal is also an online oasis of soulfully written articles, online courses, guided meditations and daily webinars from leading practitioners to calm your mind, energize your body and nourish your soul. BTH is committed to providing only the very best resources for your mental, physical, and spiritual growth It is only when we view ourselves from a holistic perspective that we realize that health is really an overall state of being. Holistic healing believes that the whole person is made up of interdependent parts and if one part is not working properly, all the other parts will be affected. In this way, if you have imbalances (physical, emotional, or spiritual) in your lives, it can negatively affect your overall health.</p>
<p>Holistic medicine focuses on the inner workings of the most advanced system in the universe: your body. I truly want to make a positive impact on peoples lives and help them heal naturlly, so help me with your contribution to make this vision come to life.</p>
<p>Warmly, Pooja</p>

When I finally managed to get all of my strength back, I decided to dedicate my life to creating a premier online marketplace for holistic healing, and changing as many lives in the process as possible. Begin to Heal was born with the mission to help people find the best holistic health practitioners, and to be a trusted source in all holistic practices.
Begin to Heal is an online platform, your trusted source on Holistic Healing, where those in search of optimal health and wellness can book video, audio, or in-person sessions with a curated list of practitioners from across the country. Our list includes over 200 highly qualified professionals, M.D.s, keynote speakers in conferences and celebrated authors.
Begin to Heal is your trusted companion in your quest for a conscious lifestyle to help you discover the marvelous benefits of Holistic healing and to make it easy for you connect with the best practitioners and read reviews on them. You can even do these sessions from the comfort of your home, with practitioners from around the world, through our state-of-the-art video calling feature for many of our practices. Begin to Heal is also an online oasis of soulfully written articles, online courses, guided meditations and daily webinars from leading practitioners to calm your mind, energize your body and nourish your soul. BTH is committed to providing only the very best resources for your mental, physical, and spiritual growth It is only when we view ourselves from a holistic perspective that we realize that health is really an overall state of being. Holistic healing believes that the whole person is made up of interdependent parts and if one part is not working properly, all the other parts will be affected. In this way, if you have imbalances (physical, emotional, or spiritual) in your lives, it can negatively affect your overall health.
Holistic medicine focuses on the inner workings of the most advanced system in the universe: your body. I truly want to make a positive impact on peoples lives and help them heal naturlly, so help me with your contribution to make this vision come to life.

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>We started Elite Performance Studios in November of 2017. As a collective, we have a background in Corrective Exercise, Combat Sports, Yoga, Zumba, Massage Therapy as well as Strength and Conditioning. Since opening our studio, we have helped many of the residents in the area to achieve their long term goals, whether it be to run a marathon, prepare for a competition or simply achieve a higher level of general fitness. We have also groomed athletes in a variety of different sports, such as: World championship boxers, world class fencers and division 1 collegiate athletes.  </p>
<p><br/>We are currently experiencing growing pains. This campaign marks a pivotal time in our transition because we have essentially outgrown our space and we are looking to expand in order to extend the best quality of service to our community. </p>
<p>A greater influx of members require more space and more equipment in order for us to continue to provide the level of service that allowed us to get to this point in the first place. For this coming year, we have also planned to run multiple classes at one time, that in which will require us to expand out of the 800 square feet that we are currently working in. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $10,000 in order to cover the cost of a new space and equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3,000 will cover the cost of some key items that we would like to add to our gym floor such as a row machine, stair climber, treadmill for advanced runners as well as newer dumbbell and kettlebell sets. (We have added the link to our amazon wish list for specific detail in terms of our intentions)</li>
<li>The remaining $7,000 will cover renovations for the new space such as: HVAC upgrades, soundproofing, bathroom renovations and mirror installation. </li>
</ul>
<p>We of course would not look to accept donations without extending anything in return :)                       Some of our perks include: </p>
<ul>
<li>An invitation to the grand opening of our new space.</li>
<li>Premium product associated with our fitness community and our in-house brand. </li>
<li>Fitness and nutritional consults. </li>
<li>Be the first to try out our brand new facility, on us.  </li>
</ul>
<p>We are looking to kick off the spring with a grand opening in May, we are hoping to ensure that we reach that goal with your support and contribution. More importantly, we are excited to grow our extended fitness family in Windsor Terrace and beyond. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As we aforementioned, we a have been active in this community for about 2 years, and as we are proud of our impact, we see the growth potential for more. With limited time and limited resources, we have managed to create hundreds of success stories. With the expansion of our studio, we project that we will be able to double our rate of service, which will ultimately result to exponential growth. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we are looking to use this time to implement a part of our 10 year plan that we have yet to explore; a youth program. The parents of the Windsor Terrace school district have been a huge part of our success in this endeavor. Our growing relationships with the parents of the district have resulted in growing relationships with the youth of the community as well and we are anxious to extend our services in that regard. The expansion of our space will allow for us to start our youth program and hopefully launch as early as Fall of 2020.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are fully aware that a financial commitment is not the best and only way in which one can contribute. We are grateful for support of any means: </p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the Indiegogo share tools to pass this on to anyone who you feel it would resonate with or who you feel would be able to help. Spreading the word is just as important to us as any monetary value. </li>
<li>Please provide the contacts of anyone that you feel we would be able to partner with, we are open to collaboration ! </li>
<li>Subscribe to our Youtube channel ! We more than welcome you into our community and beyond happy to have you. </li>
<li>Lastly, drop us an E - mail ! We would love for you to keep up with us and all of our future endeavors. </li>

Taping requires tapes, scissors, and instructions. It is just too difficult to master taping. You need help to tape certain parts of the body.   After years of research and development, we have created a new innovative performance wear that combines  kinesiology taping with compression sportswear. WaveWear is built in with thin, elastic material called BWAS™(Bio Waved Adhesive Silicone). BWAS™ has enough adhesive strength for the taping effect and is exceptionally elastic and durable.WaveWear is safe. BWAS™ was clinically tested to be harmless to the skin and leaves no residue. WaveWear is certified as class 1 grade from Europe CE medical test.WaveWear is durable. WaveWear was tested under harsh conditions. BWAS™ will stay on the fabric and will not lose adhesion even after washing.  It's resistant to sweat so it will maintain adhesive strength even when you are sweating.  WaveWear is perfectly reusable after the wash. If you feel that the adhesion has weakened, it's due to microscopic dust or lint gradually covering the surface in most cases. We recommend dry cleaning your WaveWear. We have done the testing. Dry cleaning will make it feel like a new product.   Joins & Muscle relief : When kinesiology taping is applied to the area of pain, the tape prevents hyper extension thus effectively reduces pain.Stabilize Muscles & Joints : Ease the tension of the muscles to effectively stabilize the joints and prevent injury as well as improve posture.Accelerate recovery. Reduces Muscle Fatigue as much as 35% : Reduces lactic acid as much as 35 %. WaveWear wass tested to be very effective in nationally approved institute clinical trial.  WaveWear can reduce up to 35% of lactic acid that causes muscle fatigue. It reduces undesired vibrations of the muscle, preventing delayed myalgia. WaveWear reduces swelling, promotes blood circulation and can also help with the warm-ups and the cool-downs.Use of WaveWear showed less accumulation of lactic acid compared to taping, compression wear, and non-adhesive silicone compression wear. Reduced lactic acid accumulation means less muscle fatigue and pain. For more details of clinical testing, find it on our WaveWear website technology section and R&D section.Wondering whether the taping works to all body sizes? Don't worry, we developed Body Mapping Technology, that works for everybody!Body mapped system provides taping to support back muscles, spine and the shoulders. Shoulder taping helps preventing frozen shoulders. Back taping can reduce pain and improve posture. For the lower body, knee and thigh taping supports the patella and secures to prevent injuries. The calf taping was inspired by the varicose vein kinesiology taping method for swollen leg relief. Effective for those that run and walk for a long time. Also recommended for air flights!WaveWear saves you money and helps you save the environment by reducing the use of disposable tapes.You use about 1 Meter of tape to tape a knee. This means you will use 2 meters of tape to tape both knees. Taping a calf generally require 4 meters of tape. You are using almost an entire roll of tape to tape your knees and calves.If you are taping everyday for a month, you use 30 rolls of tape. This will cost you $300. $900 for 3 months, $1800 for 6 months. If you tape everyday for a year, you will spend about $3500. Use WaveWear instead, and start saving!Imagine how many tapes you will be throwing away... WaveWear has excellent breathability even the silicone parts Excellent BreathabilityWaveWear has excellent breathability, even the BWAS™. WaveWear's fabric was certified by KATRI (Korean Apparel Testing & Research Institute) for 82mm/s breathability, which is similiar to that of cotton textiles.  Anti-Bacterial & Anti OdorThe anti-bacterial and anti-odor processing will help sports enthusiasts stay fresh even after a long workout. WaveWear's fabric was treated with high performance silver antimicrobial that harnesses the power of silver to effectively achieve the highest odor reduction efficiency with minimal dosing.  Optimal Compression We put comfort & safety first when designing our products. WaveWear has just enough compression to maximize performance and still be comfortable. WaveWear does not exceed the pressure of 4kPa, so you can feel comfortable in it. Multi-directional stretch fabric promotes free movement and comfort.   For more details of scientific research, you may find it on our WaveWear website technology section and R&D section.

Back in 2010, our co-founders Nancy and Lee were using sports tape and supporters. And they realized they can create something easier and more sustainable. Our goal is to open a new market for performance wears. We have dedicated the last 6 years to research and product development.Join us as we continue our journey of innovating sportswear by pledging to this campaign!  2 years ago, as our first step towards creating kinesiology taping sportswear, we launched our compression sleeves. We have successfully launched our sleeves on Wadiz, a Korean crowd funding platform.  Meet us at FIBO Cologne 2020 In FIBO Cologne 2020 October 1-4, our booth will be located in Hall 7/Booth No. C 61. We are happy to meet and hear from you!

My name is Jessica and I am a recent UCLA graduate. Together, with my friends from UCLA and Stanford Business School, we decided enough was enough with these obnoxiously designed, toxic products that cluttered our homes. We hated that natural products were more expensive, and most of the time, didn’t do the job. Collectively, we have 15+ years of business experience covering major functions of sales, marketing, and supply chain, alongside progressive R&amp;D and new product development expertise with Fortune 500 firms and successful startups.</p><p>Everywhere, people overpay by the thousands to simply stay away from toxic goods. As more and more formulations become cheaper, big corporations buy up new solutions and tuck them away in order to make profit and still market their same synthetic products.</p><p>We think that should change, and we’re here to make these products fair and accessible. We spent years formulating in our kitchen sink, getting our products tested with labs and consumers, even bringing on a Chief Woof Officer.

The art behind Society...We’re working with an incredible team of designers at FAY Design to deliver beautiful, simply-designed products—so that Society doesn’t only do good, but also looks good in your home.“The concept for Society's packaging system originated from a simple observation—most people hide their home products away and out of sight, in favor of displaying more visually appealing items such as artwork instead.We were inspired by artists Ellsworth Kelly, Anni & Josef Albers, and Agnes Martin and created the visual language of shapes, bold colors, and patterned arrangements.We felt there was an opportunity to create beautiful packages that could be displayed proudly in our home or office and that look as simple and pure as the ingredients inside.”— Aron Fay, FAY Design. 
Your exclusive offerAs a thank you to our early supporters, we are offering you a deal of a lifetime (literally!).

After our campaign, any new members joining will be on a monthly membership fee.
TeamHi! My name is Jessica and I am a recent UCLA graduate. Together, with my friends from UCLA and Stanford Business School, we decided enough was enough with these obnoxiously designed, toxic products that cluttered our homes. We hated that natural products were more expensive, and most of the time, didn’t do the job. Collectively, we have 15+ years of business experience covering major functions of sales, marketing, and supply chain, alongside progressive R&D and new product development expertise with Fortune 500 firms and successful startups.Everywhere, people overpay by the thousands to simply stay away from toxic goods. As more and more formulations become cheaper, big corporations buy up new solutions and tuck them away in order to make profit and still market their same synthetic products.We think that should change, and we’re here to make these products fair and accessible. We spent years formulating in our kitchen sink, getting our products tested with labs and consumers, even bringing on a Chief Woof Officer. And now, we are ready to bring to you Society, with our mission of making products that look good, are good-for-you, and are good for your wallet.We also have a team of amazing advisors along for the ride —
Thank you!At Society, we want to make clean, beautiful products affordable and available to everyone. We hope to see you as a member of the Society community!

AquaGenie’s ingenious design tracks your water consumption, reports it wirelessly to its app or to your Fitbit or Apple Health dashboard, wirelessly recharges, and is durable, washable and easy to use. AquaGenie sets your water consumption goals and lights up to remind you to meet them, even adjusting your goals if your activity or the weather suggests you should drink more.   
 
                  No need to check your phone. Just give AquaGenie a shake and the glowing ring shows red-yellow-green to tell you if you’re on track.  AquaGenie is your daily companion that keeps you on track and fully hydrated, helping you achieve all your health, wellness, fitness and weight loss goals! Attractive, durable, easy to wash and easy to use, your AquaGenie tracks your consumption, reports it to most fitness apps, and goes with you everywhere.The AquaGenie bottle knows your daily water goal and how much you've had to drink. To keep you on track, when it sees you're behind, a glowing ring at the base of the bottle lights up to remind you to take a sip. It's that simple! Our integrated sensor technology is accurate, reliable and measures at any angle, any time. Take a look at the integrated sensor in action! To recharge, just place it on its included wireless charging pad for an hour and you’re good to go for a week! No wires, no batteries to change, no need to set it still to take a measurement.AquaGenie goes with you everywhere and easily replaces your old water bottle!      The free iOS and Android application make keeping track of your daily water intake easy. The application is the hub for all of the information that helps you better understand your body and hydration levels.  The application is interactive and easily lets you see your history from the past days, weeks or months. This information helps you better understand the effects water has on your body, mood, weight and energy. We will also help you meet all your goals by suggesting updated water goals when you are more active or conditions have changed. You can even check your progress without the app. Just give AquaGenie a shake and the glowing ring shows red-yellow-green to tell you if you’re on track.   There are an abundance of fitness and weight loss apps and trackers out there that help you keep tabs on your activity, calories, health and more - we’ve downloaded more than a billion of these apps. Fitbit, Garmin, Apple Health, Samsung S Health, and MyFitnessPal all help us stay fit and on track.That’s why we wanted to make sure AquaGenie is compatible with the most popular wearables and apps on the market. All you have to do is connect your AquaGenie to your fitness tracking or weight loss app, and our patent-pending technology does the work for you. Never worry about remembering to manually input your data every day again.      AquaGenie is the first TRULY wireless and wire free smart water bottle. Other Bluetooth water bottles require you to recharge using an open USB port on the bottle, or use watch batteries that require you to periodically disassemble the bottle, remove and replace with new ones. With AquaGenie, you never need to worry about cords or batteries. Just set AquaGenie on the included wireless charging pad, and in 60 minutes, you’re good for the week! 
Glowing white ring reminds you to drink without buzzing your phone. When the battery is low, drop it on the wireless charger and the blue glowing ring confirms that it's charging. Since AquaGenie does not have any charging ports, wires or moving parts, going on adventures and washing your AquaGenie is extremely easy. AquaGenie is fully immersible and washable in hot water to allow thorough cleaning with soap without taking any pieces off (unlike first generation smart water bottles.) This will keep your bottle clean and germ-free! Make sure children and elderly loved ones are staying hydrated! As we get older, our sense of thirst decreases, making the elderly more susceptible to dehydration. And we all know children don't pay attention! With AquaGenie, you can easily keep tabs on their hydration stats and goals through the AquaGenie app and they get reminders through the day to take a sip!   
        Bottle Design: How We Made The AquaGenieTake a deeper look into the “genie’s workshop” to see just how much hard work went into creating the AquaGenie you love! Everyone knows all good products start with a “napkin sketch”. Take a look at some of our initial sketches that show the different styles, sizes and shapes we thought about offering.More sketches can be seen in update #3.After we narrowed down the selection of sketches we liked, we started to work on shapes for the bottle and what type of lid to use. Check out some of the ideas we played around with. More sketches can be seen in update #3.Once we had these sketches finalized, we explored volumes and turned the sketches into CAD drawings to understand sizing, details and to learn more about the mechanics of the bottle. Images of this can be seen in update #3.Once the renderings were all set and approved, we started to print the 3D models and parts, which eventually lead us to the amazing bottle we have today.Circuit Board DesignTake a look at “the brains of the bottle” below! Here you’ll see how we take AquaGenie way beyond the traditional water bottle that you can get at the store today.Below you can see how the processing logic will flow on the board and how all the pieces will connect and talk to each other:Once the circuit boards were fitted to the bottle and printed, the components were placed onto the board and the firmware was written to make it all work together!      Take a look at AquaGenie in action!Prototype Demo 1: Prototype Demo #2: Did you miss our Kickstarter Live sessions?

be or not to be diagnosed with a rare disease’, </b>that’s
the question that many patients who suffer from an undiagnosed rare disease ask
themselves, or their families, friends and caregivers do. 
<b><br/></b></p><p><b></b>
</p><p><b>The
problem </b>is that rare diseases present with such an unfamiliar
combination of signs and symptoms that for most physicians it makes them very
hard to diagnose! Rare diseases are often genetic, debilitating, progressive
and life threatening. There are approximately 7,000 rare diseases identified
that affect about 350 million people or on average 50,000 patients per rare
disease worldwide. Rare diseases affect &lt;1/2000 citizens in Europe and
&lt;200.000 citizens in the US. &lt;1% are diagnosed and an even smaller number
of sufferers are adequately treated. 75% of the people affected are children.
30% of these children will not live to see their 5<sup>th</sup> birthday.
Patients are often referred to numerous physicians and subjected to multiple,
costly and sometimes unnecessary medical tests. There is significant lack of
knowledge and awareness about these rare diseases and is the reason that this
""Diagnostic Odyssey in Rare Disorders™"" continues to exist for more
than 30 years. In all fairness, it is impossible for physicians to be an expert
in all 7,000 rare diseases. More and more physicians therefore use the internet
to search for the missing pieces of the puzzle. The fact that this diagnostic
odyssey in rare disorders exists more than 30 years after the passage of
the Orphan Drug Act in 1983 illustrates that current online symptom checker
portals provide insufficient information that physicians require for
differential diagnosis of patients who present with a complex and unfamiliar
combination of signs and symptoms.</p><b></b><p><b></b>
</p><p><b>Picture:</b>
The treating physician informed us that her patient has had stiffness of his
hands since he was 5 years old. He was seen by an orthopedist at another
hospital before visiting with a dermatologist at the second hospital. He was
referred to his current treatment center at the age of 8.5 years. At that time,
his intellectual quotient was 51. The enzyme assay and molecular analysis
confirmed the diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis type II, MPS II or Hunter
syndrome. He makes regular follow-up visits to ophthalmologist; ear, nose, and
throat (ENT) specialist; cardiologist; and pulmonologist. The patient is now 20
years old and has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) requiring Continuous Positive
Airway Pressure, CPAP, at night. Published with consent from family. </p>

<p>The

diagnosis?""</b></i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>""We
were stunned at the response. Within the first few hours, we got 200 replies
and 20% of those who responded had waited 10 years or longer to get an accurate
diagnosis. A significant number had waited 20, 30, even 40 years. Some wrote
that, as adults well into middle age, they finally learned that the disabling
symptoms they had experienced all their lives resulted from a disease present
at birth."" </i></p>

<p>As
part of this year's Rare Disease Day celebration, Shire, one of the leading
bio-pharmaceutical companies in rare diseases introduced a very creative

good news </b>is that for about 500 of these rare diseases
innovative treatments, so called orphan drugs, have been developed and approved
for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European
Medicines Agency (EMA). In 2014 the FDA granted 41 orphan drugs marketing
authorization and the EMA approved 10 new orphan drugs. That's about 30% more
than in 2013. This primarily is due an increasing interest in rare diseases by
the traditional pharmaceutical industry. On top of that there are about 2,000
clinical trials conducted with FDA and/or EMA approved orphan designated
investigational drugs for rare diseases/indications for which no specific
treatment exists today.

complex and unfamiliar combination of signs and symptoms. <br/></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354650/files/20150404080309-whale.svg?1428159789"" src="""" style=""""/><b>  What we have developed today</b> is a fully operational ""proof of concept"" version of RareMD™. This version contains 1,294 signs and symptoms associated with, for the moment 25 rare diseases. <br/>Actually we developed two different portals, one for the use by physicians that include medical terms for all 1,294 signs and symptoms and the other one for the use by general public with lay terms for the same 1,294 signs and symptoms. Each and every sign and symptom is labeled with a specific weight relative to its prevalence/specificity to each rare disease. The weights
are assigned by independent consulting physicians, familiar with rare diseases. <br/></p>The algorithms evaluate and calculate the specifics of selected signs and symptoms that results in a computer-generated list with predicted rare diseases a patient might
suffer from will then appear, ranked in order of probability. <br/>
<div>
<p>By clicking on the name of the rare disease(s) predicted,
RareMD™ provides a vast amount of information about that specific rare disease such as, disease description, genetics, inheritance, incidence, testing, treatments, names of hundreds of treating physicians, divided per disease,
their hospitals and websites, disease specific scientific publications,
references to registry programs and clinical trials and lists with names and
websites of local Human Genetic Societies, Societies for the Study of Inborn Errors
of Metabolism (SSIEM), laboratories, Rare Disease Organizations, Rare Disease
Specific Patient Organizations and World Rare Disease Day Organizations in &gt;100

<p>Picture: Blue Whales or Balaenoptera musculus are found in
all oceans and often swim in small groups or alone. Only 8,000 to 12,000 Blue
Whales are estimated to be alive today. They are out there somewhere but
finding them is not easy. Sightings have become very rare. The same applies for
patients who suffer from a rare disease. They live somewhere but because there
are so few per disease, identifying and properly diagnosing them has been a challenge for
decades. This analogy created the idea to have the tail fin of a whale  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354650/files/20150404080309-whale.svg?1428159789"" src="""" style=""width: 23px; height: 23px;""/>  as the logo for RareMD™.<br/></p>

which one or more FDA/EMA approved treatments are available and for which we need your help. <br/>
<p></p>
<p>As you can imagine, collecting all the above mentioned information about an additional 475 treatable rare diseases, assigning weights to the thousands of signs and symptoms and validating the expanded content of the portal requires a significant amount of time, experience, expertise and financial resources. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our
goal with this crowd funding campaign is to raise $845,000 in 60 days. That is
indeed a significant amount of money. However, bear in mind that each of the 25
rare diseases included in the proof of concept version of RareMD™ has on average about
52 signs and symptoms (ranging from 11 - 122). In addition to conducting
research for all signs and symptoms per disease it took physicians with
experience in rare disease on average about 4 hours per disease to complete the
weight assignment for all signs and symptoms. The same process will apply for
the additional 475 rare diseases. This ""manual weight assignment component""
is exactly what differentiates RareMD™ from all existing symptom checker and
disease prediction portals. 66% of the funds needed will be used for data
collection of all signs &amp; symptoms, weight assignments &amp; validation of
the expanded content by a team of medical/scientific advisers and translation
of signs and symptoms into lay-terms. For each rare disease in the proof of
concept version we included 19 different sets of data. We will include
minimally the same sets of data for the additional 475 rare diseases; 16% of
the funds will be used for software architecture adjustments, website &amp; App
design; 11% for the global introduction campaign of RareMD™ in 2016; 2% for FDA
mHealth regulatory compliance and legal counsel; 5% crowd funding fees. 100% of
funds will be used for these activities. This is a very labor intensive
undertaking resulting in the best in class rare disease specific portal. Please
remember that regardless of how many treatments are available today or will be
in the near future, patients who need these new therapies may never benefit
from these if they cannot get an accurate diagnosis! </p>
<p>If
we raise more than $845.000 we will use these additional funds to develop and
implement some of our future goals. See 'Business Development' below. If we
raise less than this amount we will have to adjust the development of the
portal accordingly but with the same passion and commitment.</p>

</div></div>","‘To
be or not to be diagnosed with a rare disease’, that’s
the question that many patients who suffer from an undiagnosed rare disease ask
themselves, or their families, friends and caregivers do. 

The
problem is that rare diseases present with such an unfamiliar
combination of signs and symptoms that for most physicians it makes them very
hard to diagnose! Rare diseases are often genetic, debilitating, progressive
and life threatening. There are approximately 7,000 rare diseases identified
that affect about 350 million people or on average 50,000 patients per rare
disease worldwide. Rare diseases affect <1/2000 citizens in Europe and
<200.000 citizens in the US. <1% are diagnosed and an even smaller number
of sufferers are adequately treated. 75% of the people affected are children.
30% of these children will not live to see their 5th birthday.
Patients are often referred to numerous physicians and subjected to multiple,
costly and sometimes unnecessary medical tests. There is significant lack of
knowledge and awareness about these rare diseases and is the reason that this
""Diagnostic Odyssey in Rare Disorders™"" continues to exist for more
than 30 years. In all fairness, it is impossible for physicians to be an expert
in all 7,000 rare diseases. More and more physicians therefore use the internet
to search for the missing pieces of the puzzle. The fact that this diagnostic
odyssey in rare disorders exists more than 30 years after the passage of
the Orphan Drug Act in 1983 illustrates that current online symptom checker
portals provide insufficient information that physicians require for
differential diagnosis of patients who present with a complex and unfamiliar
combination of signs and symptoms.
Picture:
The treating physician informed us that her patient has had stiffness of his
hands since he was 5 years old. He was seen by an orthopedist at another
hospital before visiting with a dermatologist at the second hospital. He was
referred to his current treatment center at the age of 8.5 years. At that time,
his intellectual quotient was 51. The enzyme assay and molecular analysis
confirmed the diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis type II, MPS II or Hunter
syndrome. He makes regular follow-up visits to ophthalmologist; ear, nose, and
throat (ENT) specialist; cardiologist; and pulmonologist. The patient is now 20
years old and has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) requiring Continuous Positive
Airway Pressure, CPAP, at night. Published with consent from family. 







The
National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) in the United States posted the
following question on its Facebook page in 2013: 
""How long did it take you or a loved one to get an accurate
diagnosis?""

""We
were stunned at the response. Within the first few hours, we got 200 replies
and 20% of those who responded had waited 10 years or longer to get an accurate
diagnosis. A significant number had waited 20, 30, even 40 years. Some wrote
that, as adults well into middle age, they finally learned that the disabling
symptoms they had experienced all their lives resulted from a disease present
at birth.""

Dunkle, Vice President Communications at NORD. For the full story please click

Also
in 2013, Global Genes - RARE Project, the Genetic Alliance UK, Duke University
Medical Center, the University of Chicago, the Salford Royal NHS Foundation,
the New York University and the University of York UK conducted a survey
amongst patients, caregivers and physicians in the US and UK. The results,
included in ""Rare Disease Impact Report"", were presented at the World
Orphan Drug Congress in Washington DC that year.








""On
average, it takes 5.6. years in the UK for a patient with a rare disease to
receive a proper diagnosis.""



""On average, it takes 7.6 years in the US for a patient
with a rare disease to receive a proper diagnosis.""

One
can only speculate about how long this would take in other countries outside of
the US and UK.

As
part of this year's Rare Disease Day celebration, Shire, one of the leading
bio-pharmaceutical companies in rare diseases introduced a very creative
info-graphic explaining the challenges patients face on their Journey to
Diagnosis for Rare Diseases. Please click on: http://html.investis.com/s/shire/shire/index.html. 
 The
good news is that for about 500 of these rare diseases
innovative treatments, so called orphan drugs, have been developed and approved
for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European
Medicines Agency (EMA). In 2014 the FDA granted 41 orphan drugs marketing
authorization and the EMA approved 10 new orphan drugs. That's about 30% more
than in 2013. This primarily is due an increasing interest in rare diseases by
the traditional pharmaceutical industry. On top of that there are about 2,000
clinical trials conducted with FDA and/or EMA approved orphan designated
investigational drugs for rare diseases/indications for which no specific
treatment exists today.
  The bad news is that regardless of how many treatments
are available today or will be in the near future, patients who need these new therapies may never benefit from these if they 
can’t get an accurate diagnosis to begin with!   The solution that could finally end this ""Diagnostic Odyssey in Rare Disorders™"" is the development of an innovative, rare disease specific, custom designed, best in class, patent pending, interactive web portal called RareMD™. RareMD supports physicians in their process of differential diagnosis of patients who present with a 
complex and unfamiliar combination of signs and symptoms.   What we have developed today is a fully operational ""proof of concept"" version of RareMD™. This version contains 1,294 signs and symptoms associated with, for the moment 25 rare diseases. Actually we developed two different portals, one for the use by physicians that include medical terms for all 1,294 signs and symptoms and the other one for the use by general public with lay terms for the same 1,294 signs and symptoms. Each and every sign and symptom is labeled with a specific weight relative to its prevalence/specificity to each rare disease. The weights
are assigned by independent consulting physicians, familiar with rare diseases. The algorithms evaluate and calculate the specifics of selected signs and symptoms that results in a computer-generated list with predicted rare diseases a patient might
suffer from will then appear, ranked in order of probability. 

By clicking on the name of the rare disease(s) predicted,
RareMD™ provides a vast amount of information about that specific rare disease such as, disease description, genetics, inheritance, incidence, testing, treatments, names of hundreds of treating physicians, divided per disease,
their hospitals and websites, disease specific scientific publications,
references to registry programs and clinical trials and lists with names and
websites of local Human Genetic Societies, Societies for the Study of Inborn Errors
of Metabolism (SSIEM), laboratories, Rare Disease Organizations, Rare Disease
Specific Patient Organizations and World Rare Disease Day Organizations in >100
countries on 6 continents. 
To better understand how the proof of concept version of RareMD™ operates please watch a short video by clicking on http://raremd.exaptive.com/intro.


Picture: Blue Whales or Balaenoptera musculus are found in
all oceans and often swim in small groups or alone. Only 8,000 to 12,000 Blue
Whales are estimated to be alive today. They are out there somewhere but
finding them is not easy. Sightings have become very rare. The same applies for
patients who suffer from a rare disease. They live somewhere but because there
are so few per disease, identifying and properly diagnosing them has been a challenge for
decades. This analogy created the idea to have the tail fin of a whale    as the logo for RareMD™.


  What we need to do next, and what this global crowd funding campaign is all about, is to expand the current content of RareMD™ with 25 rare diseases to the approximately 500 rare diseases for 
which one or more FDA/EMA approved treatments are available and for which we need your help. 

As you can imagine, collecting all the above mentioned information about an additional 475 treatable rare diseases, assigning weights to the thousands of signs and symptoms and validating the expanded content of the portal requires a significant amount of time, experience, expertise and financial resources. 



Our
goal with this crowd funding campaign is to raise $845,000 in 60 days. That is
indeed a significant amount of money. However, bear in mind that each of the 25
rare diseases included in the proof of concept version of RareMD™ has on average about
52 signs and symptoms (ranging from 11 - 122). In addition to conducting
research for all signs and symptoms per disease it took physicians with
experience in rare disease on average about 4 hours per disease to complete the
weight assignment for all signs and symptoms. The same process will apply for
the additional 475 rare diseases. This ""manual weight assignment component""
is exactly what differentiates RareMD™ from all existing symptom checker and
disease prediction portals. 66% of the funds needed will be used for data
collection of all signs & symptoms, weight assignments & validation of
the expanded content by a team of medical/scientific advisers and translation
of signs and symptoms into lay-terms. For each rare disease in the proof of
concept version we included 19 different sets of data. We will include
minimally the same sets of data for the additional 475 rare diseases; 16% of
the funds will be used for software architecture adjustments, website & App
design; 11% for the global introduction campaign of RareMD™ in 2016; 2% for FDA
mHealth regulatory compliance and legal counsel; 5% crowd funding fees. 100% of
funds will be used for these activities. This is a very labor intensive
undertaking resulting in the best in class rare disease specific portal. Please
remember that regardless of how many treatments are available today or will be
in the near future, patients who need these new therapies may never benefit
from these if they cannot get an accurate diagnosis! 
If
we raise more than $845.000 we will use these additional funds to develop and
implement some of our future goals. See 'Business Development' below. If we
raise less than this amount we will have to adjust the development of the
portal accordingly but with the same passion and commitment.
Please
contribute to this campaign in whatever amount you desire to support the continuing
development and introduction of RareMD™.


  What contributors receive in return is one or more free RareMD™ Apps, depending on the amount contributed. See Perks! 
Access to RareMD™ web portal will be FREE for all users of desktop and laptop computers. 

For those who prefer to use their mobile device(s), one can download a RareMD™ App for an annual fee. 
We believe that the use of RareMD™ will result in a much faster diagnosis of hundreds if not thousands of patients who suffer from a rare disease around the world. 
  Endorsements: We are very pleased, honored and encouraged by the fact that the
 following renowned clinical experts and key opinion leaders in the global rare disease community have 
endorsed the development of RareMD™.

I need to take them full time.

<p>I’m
asking for $100,000.00, because that lets me hire the staff we need, and keep
them employed pending revenue generation.<span> 
As Phase 2 ramps up, I see this as being more like a 25 person firm, up
from our current 1 full time equivalent (I am uncompensated, and my other
employees are part time).  </span></p>
<p>I
also expect, by late this year, to need to take office space, primarily for
customer support and business support staff.<span> 
I fully expect to have the software engineers and testers work remotely,
and will also have support staff work remotely as they are trained.  We won’t do that until revenues from the
product support having such a facility. 
Until then, I will have people train at my house, and then work remotely
as needed.</span></p>
<p>As
a side note, having been in IT as long as I have, I have come to the conclusion
that NOONE needs to go into an office and work.<span> 
Big companies like IBM, Oracle, and others have huge remote work forces
and they are doing extremely well.  So,
let’s cut traffic, cut carbon, and let people enjoy those extra hours a day

<p>Starting
a business is a lot of things.<span>  It is so
fun it is scary!  It is also so scary it
is scary.</span></p>
<p>This
isn’t my first business.<span>  In the early
part of last decade, I started a business called dbDoctor that did predictive
analysis of database systems.  That is
geek speak for telling you a database would crash before it happened.  I raised a lot of venture capital, hired a phenomenal
CEO to replace me as the leader of the company, and we employed 26 people for 3
years.  I learned more from my CEO,
Vandy, than I ever could have believed.  He
was an outstanding mentor, and I will always look up to that man.</span></p>
<p>After
the events of 9/11, the market contracted, and our Venture Capitalists made a
decision to shut us down.<span>  It was the
right decision, and I learned a lot from that too.</span></p>
<p>It
isn’t easy losing something that you put your heart and soul into.<span>  Honestly, the impact to your family is just
as bad as the impact to your business. 
But you do, indeed, learn a lot.</span></p>
<p>What
this means for me is I understand how precious cash is, and how important cash
flow is to a small company.<span>  Profit is an
accounting term.  Cash is king.</span></p>
<p>I
also understand how to empower and motivate people to work hard, and have the
highest possible quality work.<span>  Quality,
not quantity, is the foundation of a successful business.</span></p>
<p>However,
there are always risks involved with any new thing you do.<span>  Here are a few of the risks we face:</span></p>
<p><span>1)<span> 
</span></span>We
are defining a new market.<span>  Very few
companies cater to the elderly outside of insurance programs and medical
firms.  Having a technology company with
the elderly in mind is fresh, and a steep curve for adoption.</span></p>
<p><span>2)<span> 
</span></span>We
won’t be selling to the people who use the product.<span>  DadPad requires that someone help the end
user, by setting up content and staying informed about what their Recipient
wants to see and do.  </span></p>
<p><span>3)<span> 
</span></span>Our
market is vast.<span>  There are 21 million
people in the US between the ages of 70 and 85. 
How do you market to that age group? 
How do we penetrate that market? 
Lot of work to do here.</span></p>
<p><span>4)<span> 
</span></span>An
iPad is expensive, with new models starting at about 400 dollars.<span>  This is a significant barrier to entry.  Moving to Android will help bring prices down
considerably.</span></p>
<p><span>5)<span> 
</span></span>It
takes time.<span>  People have to be willing to
commit some up front time to add content to a device, and then be willing to
update with new content periodically. 
That can be tough for someone with a busy schedule.</span></p>
<p>I’m
prepared to meet those risks.<span>  I’ve
already begun conversations with several seniors organizations, and will be
meeting with more.  For marketing,
several large organizations are already in place, and we can buy ad space
through those companies.  And as far as
getting Android running, well, that is why we are here!</span></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435893214/bdlna6lu4mgchuefailt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>At
first, I was thinking about Alzheimer’s patients as the people who would use
DadPad.<span>  But it didn’t take long before I
realized that many of the elderly that live here in the US have similar
problems.  Technology changes so fast
that they have a hard time keeping up. 
And even as simple as we consider an iPad or Android tablet to be, it is
really tough for the elderly to use them. 
Tablets have very small fonts, lots of buttons, and lots of motions
needed to use them.  Swiping, pinching,
twisting… I can do this, and you probably can as well.  But can you imagine trying to talk to someone
who is not good with technology and telling them what you are trying to get
them to do?  ‘Just pinch the screen and
it will get smaller, Grandma.’</span></p>
<p>DadPad’s
impact is simple:<span>  We help the elderly or
those with cognitive disorders stay connected and engaged.  </span></p>
<p>If
you look at our current population, it is aging fast.<span>  Our young people using electronic
communications to chat with someone in the same room!  The old are, quite frankly, left out.  It’s very sad.</span></p>
<p>Take
a look some time in a nursing home, or in an area that is mostly older
people.<span>  They move slow.  They sleep a lot.  They just aren’t engaged.  The reason? 
They can’t understand technology.</span></p>
<p>With
DadPad, the older person comes alive.<span> 
They smile more.  They are more
expressive talking.  They are more
engaged in life.  </span></p>
<p>We
want to have as many people as possible helping our elderly to stay engaged,
fulfilled, and to feel less sad and alone.</p>

<p>Let’s
support our elderly!</p>
<br/><p></p></div>","The elderly have a hard time keeping up with rapid technology 
changes.  They may become confused with too many options, too many web 
sites, and in understanding what is safe for them to look at.  As 
computers and tablets get more advanced, and screen resolutions get 
higher, the text gets smaller and harder to read.  DadPad gives an older
 user a simple interface, big text, and the security of knowing that the
 content they see comes from their loved ones – your family.
DadPad Features

We
have come a long, ways, but there is a lot left to do!
For
Phase 1 of DadPad, we have the web site that allows content management completed.  We have the iPad interface coded, and it is
in test now.  Our marketing site is up
and running.  We have made remarkable
strides in getting ready to go to market.
We
are within 2 weeks of Beta test now, where we hope to have between 50 and 100
customers use DadPad and give us feedback. 
We will be making adjustments during the month of beta testing, and expect
to be ready for the general market by the end of August, 2015.
What
we need is money to do all this.  Our
developers have been working part time for us. 
I need to take them full time. 
Quickly.
Currently,
our development staff consists of this:
· 
Brent
(the founder):  Product design, team
management, and test.
· 
Jakob
(the UI genius):  User interface, graphic
arts, and visual design.
· 
Alex
(the programmer): Ruby on Rails and iOS development.
While
we can do a lot, there is a lot more that we need.  Here are some of the positions I need to
fill:
· 
iOS
Developer for DadPad Administrator App
· 
Android
Developers for DadPad Android app, and Android Administrator App
· 
iOS
and Android Developer for Communicator App
· 
Product
Tester for mobile devices
· 
Product
Tester for Web interfaces
· 
Product
Champion and Marketing for strategic sales
· 
Customer
Support personnel
I’m
asking for $100,000.00, because that lets me hire the staff we need, and keep
them employed pending revenue generation. 
As Phase 2 ramps up, I see this as being more like a 25 person firm, up
from our current 1 full time equivalent (I am uncompensated, and my other
employees are part time).  
I
also expect, by late this year, to need to take office space, primarily for
customer support and business support staff. 
I fully expect to have the software engineers and testers work remotely,
and will also have support staff work remotely as they are trained.  We won’t do that until revenues from the
product support having such a facility. 
Until then, I will have people train at my house, and then work remotely
as needed.
As
a side note, having been in IT as long as I have, I have come to the conclusion
that NOONE needs to go into an office and work. 
Big companies like IBM, Oracle, and others have huge remote work forces
and they are doing extremely well.  So,
let’s cut traffic, cut carbon, and let people enjoy those extra hours a day
they spend commuting just by letting them work from home, shall we?

Starting
a business is a lot of things.  It is so
fun it is scary!  It is also so scary it
is scary.
This
isn’t my first business.  In the early

However,
there are always risks involved with any new thing you do.  Here are a few of the risks we face:

That can be tough for someone with a busy schedule.
I’m
prepared to meet those risks.  I’ve
already begun conversations with several seniors organizations, and will be

<h3></h3><p><b>About this project</b></p>
<p>We are creating the fitness app of the next generation! Calistix is a virtual personal trainer that offers a huge variety of sports activities: more than 100 exercises, indoors and outdoors, with or without equipment, for any fitness level from beginners to competitive athletes. It is a true all-in-one app with three different options - endurance, body workout and cross sports. The innovative ghost mode let’s you enter in virtual competitions with friends. Extras include a heart rate sensor, a pedometer, a BMI &amp; WHR Calculator and standardized fitness tests. What’s best: Calistix is 100% free of charge and requires no registration.</p>

<li>Plex users receive a comprehensive snapshot of their sleep and breathing patterns which can then be shared with their sleep physician.</li>

<div>MobileSleepDoc is a mobile app created by sleep experts designed to help people who have trouble sleeping. It has many features and resources to help people who have issues with sleep, including questionnaires that screen for possible sleep disorders and two therapies for insomnia. It also allows you to store information about your sleep habits, called sleep logs, and gives you feedback, in the form of graphs, on whether you're making progress in addressing your sleep issues. It is meant to be a tool that people can use to help themselves, but it is also recommended that people use the app in conjunction with advice and guidance from their doctors. <p></p>
<p>The Plex Sleep Scanner will integrate with the free MobileSleepDoc app so users can monitor their sleep reports right from their phone. </p>

Introducing The Plex Sleep Scanner, by Somnology.
A Sleep Tracking Wearable Device

Uses medical-grade sensors that go beyond capturing sleep behaviors, to monitor breathing patterns, pulse, and oxygen levels during sleep.
Plex users receive a comprehensive snapshot of their sleep and breathing patterns which can then be shared with their sleep physician.
Brings real-time information to users and their doctors about diagnostic possibilities underlying their sleep issues.

Our mission is to help as many people with sleep problems as possible, for the lowest possible cost. Despite efforts to improve healthcare coverage, many people still do not have access to the care they need to make positive changes in their lives. We believe personal tracking devices have tremendous potential but need to do more than provide reams of useless, and potentially inaccurate, data. 




The Plex Sleep Screener uses medical-grade sensors to accurately measure the user’s breathing patterns, movement, body position, heart rate, and oxygen levels, then sends the date to our secure servers for processing. Through the integrated app (MobileSleepDoc Pro) and the Plex Website, we provide the user with a report of our findings. The simple report shows a severity indicator, whereas the extended report shows the user details of clinically validated sleep disturbance indices.This information can be used to make significant lifestyle changes, to share with your doctor for further testing and discussion, and to track the progress of a current sleep treatment program. For example, users who are under treatment already for obstructive sleep apnea can us the Plex Sleep Scanner to monitor their progress and treatment efficacy.




Use Plex Sleep Scanner with MobileSleepDoc Pro App

MobileSleepDoc is a mobile app created by sleep experts designed to help people who have trouble sleeping. It has many features and resources to help people who have issues with sleep, including questionnaires that screen for possible sleep disorders and two therapies for insomnia. It also allows you to store information about your sleep habits, called sleep logs, and gives you feedback, in the form of graphs, on whether you're making progress in addressing your sleep issues. It is meant to be a tool that people can use to help themselves, but it is also recommended that people use the app in conjunction with advice and guidance from their doctors. 
The Plex Sleep Scanner will integrate with the free MobileSleepDoc app so users can monitor their sleep reports right from their phone.

   The Impact




More than 40 million Americans have trouble getting a good night’s sleep, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many choose the pharmacological route, leading to 58.5 million prescriptions issues in 2012, up 10% from 2007, according to IMS Health – a healthcare information firm.

Benefits of a good night's sleep:


According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, several studies conducted in recent years point to the following benefits of getting a regular good night’s sleep:

Men treating their sleep apnea with CPAP see improvement in their sexual function and satisfaction.
Better sleep will literally help you feel better. A recent study showed a link between more sleep and decreased sensitivity to pain.
Men with obstructive sleep apnea can reduce their blood pressure with treatment of the apnea.
Sleep-deprived teens may have increased resistance to insulin.

The Plex can help users reach their full healthy sleep potential!
Reasons why monitoring your sleep patterns is important (and these are just a handful!):


We don't sleep the same way every night, so a single snapshot of your sleep may miss important information.


If you were trying a program such as weight loss or side-sleeping, you could track improvements in your sleep patterns.


If you decided to keep a regular schedule and make other changes in your bedtime routine, you could track your improvement in sleep efficiency and continuity.


If your health status changed or you were started on new medications, you could monitor yourself for changes in sleep patterns.


If you were already on a program for sleep such as CPAP or a dental device, you could check for stability over time.



Funding Allocation and Budget:



Plex manufacturing and design refinements 80%


Software engineering: user portal, server, and hardware
integration 20%

KILLS: There
we said it. Simple, aggressive, blunt and to the point. Hundreds of people,
each and every month, will take their own lives while struggling with PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) and
they do so quite simply because people treat them like ""they are
crazy"" if they raise their hands and ask for support.Why do I care? ""In 2011/2012 four friends/acquaintances took their own lives. All were combat Marines, all were civilians for less than a year and all struggled with PTSD and transition to civilian life in general. Oh, and all four were under the age of 28. Their deaths hit me between the eyes, not so much that they were no longer with us, but more that they had survived multiple combat tours, but could not overcome the challenge of civilian life with PTSD. Being a British veteran who has struggled with my own PTSD, (I didn't even realize that until recently) and as someone who is lucky enough to call this great nation home, I felt that something had to be done. And here we are, 4 years later."" - RJC PS This weekend we lost one of our own - RIP Art.                                           Why should you care? On one side -
veterans and civilians alike, are trying to cope with PTSD. They are doing so despondent, self-medicated and alone, and all too often they end up killing
themselves. On the other side - care givers with alternative treatment
protocols, adaptive sports, healing camps, educational resources, buddy systems,
and those who have learned to cope, are standing by to help...
                                               
The reality is, that these two
demographics could not be further apart, and as long as the stigma associated
with PTSD prevents those struggling with it from seeking help, we will continue
to bury them.           Unlike
other life threatening challenges,
(Cancer, ALS, Autism, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s etc.) we don’t need to spend
decades of time or billions of dollars to change the PTSD narrative. We can do
it now for pennies on the dollar by focusing on prevention through education, while using today's technology, instead of waiting until more intensive treatments and emergency measures are
needed.These
deaths,thousands
each and every year, are for the most part, totally preventable if we can simply, and honestly,
begin a dialogue with those who struggle with PTSD.                    What can we do about it? If given the opportunity, by those who struggle with PTSD, we have the ability to offer them a myriad of proven treatments and alternatives to today's ""fix"" of choice - prescription drugs. From alternative treatment protocols, adaptive sports, buddy and mentorship programs, the VA's Peer Support Counselors and Vet 2 Vet programs, there are many options.What we will do with your seed money and funds to come.1. Continue to
develop the program, process and strategic plan
2. Apply for
more (4 to date) national/regional foundation grants as a 501(C)(3)
3. Develop an
Application Program Interface (API) to connect with the multi-million dollar Unite US
community platform                                                                     4. Manage national outreach and registration process for care givers as in anyone who provides non-pharmacological
support for those struggling with PTSD
5. Begin a national outreach
program to invite those struggling with PTSD to register onto our Unite US
platform. Outreach through sports, media, TV, anywhere they live and play 
6. Connect those struggling with PTSD to those most qualified to advise,
support, engage, mentor and teach them about the challenges of dealing with
PTSD 
7. Design and
develop a smart app. to provide instant access to support and information about
PTSD. Positive push marketing – event updates – crisis line – text and social
media connection to peers and support.
Note: Registration
equates to non-invasive, highly confidential, identification of everyone
involved in the ""PTSD World"". Veteran or Civilian. Struggling or
Coping. Client or Care Giver. Worried about someone or have already lost
someone. For us to be successful everyone must have a voice.                                        Picture a virtual community where those struggling with PTSD have
unfettered access to educational support and direct links to those who can help
them cope. In turn, picture a forum where those who understand PTSD and know how
to help those who struggle with it, get to apply their skills and prevent yet
another senseless suicide. It’s really not rocket science, we just need to use
today’s technology a lot more effectively than we do to make it happen.
Our Measurements of success in 2015:
National web/cloud based PTS Community populated with 5000 unique
registrations from people struggling with PTSD combined with proactive
connections to appropriate support options. 250/750 care
giver registrations from those most qualified to provide support, and

<p><b>Based on our study of the communities and
the requests we received from the community organizations and the leadership,
this community does not have a qualitative healthcare facility. There are several villages in this
part of the world where people are driven by despair and sickness. Most of them
are the victims of malnutrition. Many of them do not have any regular income;
they live in the remote villages away from the mainstream of life. They depend
upon the poor cultivation for their livelihood. There is no conveyance to reach
certain areas; we have to walk miles to reach such areas to help them. During the
monsoon, the people suffer with various diseases. Malaria, mostly Falciparum
malaria, acute diarrhea, jaundice are the terrific killers of many people. Many
die without proper medical assistance. These people are struggling for
survival. It is a heart-breaking scene to witness that the relatives stand
helpless with deep sigh while their dear ones die like flies.</b></p>

</p><p><b>There are several villages in this part of our country where
people have various sicknesses. Most of them are victims of malnutrition. Malaria,
mostly Falciparum malaria and jaundice are the terrific killers of many people.
Many die without any medical assistance even today. Many of them do not have
any regular income; they live in the remote villages away from the mainstream
of life. There is no proper conveyance to reach such areas. These people are
struggling for survival. It is a heart-breaking scene to witness that the
beloved ones stand helpless with deep sigh while their dear ones die like
flies. We are unable to sort out this mess due to the lack of many things, but
our doctors and health workers do their level best to reach out and help a few
victims out of the dangerous condition. It is our prayer to God to enable us to
do our maximum to treat them and bring them to the love and peace of our Savior. We are trying to obey the heart-beats of
Jesus; once He told “I was hungry but you didn't give me food, I was sick but
you didn't care me.</b></p>
<p><b>We are concentrating on
the people groups living in the forest villages without any medical care. They
lead a pitiable life; we can watch human beings live below the standard of
animals. </b><b>It

known medical organizations to contribute medicines, second hand clothing, and
whatever ways someone help us to carry on with our vision in this particular

Based on our study of the communities and
the requests we received from the community organizations and the leadership,
this community does not have a qualitative healthcare facility. There are several villages in this
part of the world where people are driven by despair and sickness. Most of them
are the victims of malnutrition. Many of them do not have any regular income;
they live in the remote villages away from the mainstream of life. They depend
upon the poor cultivation for their livelihood. There is no conveyance to reach
certain areas; we have to walk miles to reach such areas to help them. During the
monsoon, the people suffer with various diseases. Malaria, mostly Falciparum
malaria, acute diarrhea, jaundice are the terrific killers of many people. Many
die without proper medical assistance. These people are struggling for
survival. It is a heart-breaking scene to witness that the relatives stand
helpless with deep sigh while their dear ones die like flies.

The area where we would like to establish
the hospital is surrounded by remote villages where poor & needy
communities leading a hard life without having any proper medical facilities. Why Need this:
There are several villages in this part of our country where
people have various sicknesses. Most of them are victims of malnutrition. Malaria,
mostly Falciparum malaria and jaundice are the terrific killers of many people.
Many die without any medical assistance even today. Many of them do not have
any regular income; they live in the remote villages away from the mainstream
of life. There is no proper conveyance to reach such areas. These people are
struggling for survival. It is a heart-breaking scene to witness that the
beloved ones stand helpless with deep sigh while their dear ones die like
flies. We are unable to sort out this mess due to the lack of many things, but
our doctors and health workers do their level best to reach out and help a few
victims out of the dangerous condition. It is our prayer to God to enable us to
do our maximum to treat them and bring them to the love and peace of our Savior. We are trying to obey the heart-beats of
Jesus; once He told “I was hungry but you didn't give me food, I was sick but
you didn't care me.
We are concentrating on
the people groups living in the forest villages without any medical care. They
lead a pitiable life; we can watch human beings live below the standard of
animals. It
is our humble request to your good selves, to introduce us to your friends or
known medical organizations to contribute medicines, second hand clothing, and
whatever ways someone help us to carry on with our vision in this particular
field.
The above mentioned communities have a very high rate of communicable diseases. Governmental or non-governmental agencies have not met the healthcare needs of the communities.

There is no childcare available for a single mom with a disabled child so working is extremely difficult provided they can even find work. If a mom is employed the average wage would be approximately $75 per week.  Some anti-convulsion medications are as high as $200 per month.

<p>Paty Orozco (our President) had a dream a month before her
daughter was born. In her dream she was surrounded by people with disabilities
and she was helping them. The dream upset her a lot. Paty did not have much
exposure to people with disabilities and she didn’t know what to make of the
dream. A month later her beautiful daughter Lupita was born. Lupita is
diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy and Hydrocephalus. </p>
<p>Paty quickly learned there was no help for families with
disabilities so she decided to help her daughter and other families with
disabled children in any way she could. She started out with her friends
selling tamales and sodas on street corners to raise money.</p>

</div></div>","WHAT WE DO:
For 6 years Volunteers Without Limits has served the San Felipe community and currently serves 26 disabled children and 11 disabled adults. We are the only organization in the community that provides much needed services for the families. There are no government support programs. We provide diapers, Ensure, food, wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, canes and help with medications, Dr. visits, lab tests, therapies, and transportation to exams 2 hours away. There is no childcare available for a single mom with a disabled child so working is extremely difficult provided they can even find work. If a mom is employed the average wage would be approximately $75 per week.  Some anti-convulsion medications are as high as $200 per month. They NEED our help.THE INSPIRATION BEHIND VOLUNTEERS WITHOUT LIMITS


Paty Orozco (our President) had a dream a month before her
daughter was born. In her dream she was surrounded by people with disabilities
and she was helping them. The dream upset her a lot. Paty did not have much
exposure to people with disabilities and she didn’t know what to make of the
dream. A month later her beautiful daughter Lupita was born. Lupita is
diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy and Hydrocephalus. 
Paty quickly learned there was no help for families with
disabilities so she decided to help her daughter and other families with
disabled children in any way she could. She started out with her friends
selling tamales and sodas on street corners to raise money.


Volunteers Without Limits also operates a small thrift store which offers very inexpensive clothes and household items to those that can afford them. For those that cannot afford them, we provide clothes, shoes, jackets, blankets, fans, beds and/or whatever we can to help those in need in the  community. 








KO HAMBRE (Knock Out Hunger) - Volunteers Without Limits also hosts the KO Hambre program and


currently cooks and delivers food to approximately 100 homebound people each day Mon-Fri and serve about 10-12 people off the street. For most, this is their only meal of the day. We deliver to the elderly, disabled, sick, and single mothers with small children. It is our version of Meals on Wheels. Down here it is different than in the states. We don't have companies and grocery stores etc. that donate food. We have to purchase our food from a wholesale distributor. The KO was chosen in memory of Kuchy Sanchez and Olivia Valdez who tirelessly helped so many people in the community. 
Please visit our galleries here, on our FB page and our website to see more of what we do!Volunteers Without Limitsis seeking $48,800$1500 x 12 months = $18,000 to be used to continue to buy food and deliver 26,000 meals to the homebound.$900 x 12 months = $10,800 = 1 year of operational costs (rent, electric, gas, phone, water, propane)
$10,000 to purchase a dependable, reliable and more
efficient enclosed delivery vehicle. This will help ensure the quality and
safety of the food and will also help us to pick up donated items and provide
other transportation.
$10,000 for kitchen equipment (range, exhaust hood, freezer, work tables and shelving)                                                                      OUR HISTORY

VSL/VWL is a Mexico registered Asociacion Civil (non-profit) located in San Felipe, Baja California, Mexico. We originally started in 2009 as Paso a Pasito (an organization to help disabled children and their families) and took over the San Felipe Food Bank A.C.  and brought both organizations together to form Voluntarios Sin Limites. Volunteers Without Limits has a Mexican President - Paty Orozco and a Mexican board. There are several Americans and Canadians that are mentors, facilitators, and volunteers and are heavily involved in the organization. 
Our organization is volunteer and donation based. We have no administrative salaries and our operational costs (rent, electric, propane, gas, phone etc) is paid for out of donations we receive. Our operational costs are approximately $900 per month. 
San Felipe is a small fishing village located two hours south of the California border. In 2003-2008 San Felipe was becoming a booming tourist and development area.

THE IMPACT OF YOUR DONATIONS
ON THE COMMUNITY!

be the only food they have to eat that day. We currently have a waiting list

Someone wise once said “Feed the hungry, clothe the poor and visit the sick”! We are here to serve!



OUR FUTURE VISION:


Create childcare and job opportunities for the
parents of disabled children
We currently had the equipment donated to open a
juice/smoothie bar to help us become more self-supporting and sustainable. We
hope to get to a point where we can provide fresh juices to the elderly and
disabled to provide a better nutritional option than chemically laden
nutritional drinks.
Create a community garden large enough to
provide food for the kitchen, the juice bar and to teach the community
sustainable gardening skills.
Create a safe house for new mothers with
disabled children to provide support to help with the challenging first year.

<h3>KITE
4 WATER</h3>
<p>
The
Kite 4 Water team is taking the first step for the kiteboarding
industry to bring clean water access to people all around the world.
 </p>
<p>
Our
mission is simple: <b>bring clean water access to every single
person that needs it</b>.  Our campaign involves identifying
communities world-wide that need clean water, traveling to these
regions that are in need, connecting with community leaders to
distribute water filters, and educating the communities on filter
uses and functionality.  We will also be documenting every
trip to share each community's story and the life-changing impact
that these filters have.</p>

Clean
water project: NEPAL <b>UPDATE</b></p>
<p>
Our
clean water ambassador Khris Loux is currently in Nepal building
septic tanks, toilets, clean water filtration systems, and helping to
educated people on proper hygiene in the aftermath of natural
disasters.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	1)
	The government pumps water but does NOT purify, so the water is not
	safe. (This is why our filter systems are so important.)</p>
<p>
	2)
	The earthquake destroyed or severely damaged 600k homes and 5k
	public buildings.</p>
<p>
	3)
	Displaced people are living under tarps, in man-made temporary
	housing and have no toilets or running water.</p>
<p>
	4)
	The result is open defecation which leaches into the ground water
	creating high probabilities of outbreak of disease.</p>
<p>
	5)
	Prior to the earthquake 10,500+ children where dying EVERY YEAR from
	diarrhea, caused by contaminated water.  (Preventable with the
	filtration systems.) The risk of this number greatly increasing
	this year is very real.</p>
<p>
	7)
	Compounding the problem is the blockaded of fuel by India two months
	ago. (India is reacting to Nepal's recent Constitution.)</p>
<p>
	8)
	Fact from Nepal Progress Report: 50% of population, 16m people,
	practices open defecation, 80% of communicable diseases are a result
	of contaminated water.</p>
<p>
	9)
	We are working on a project to install 700 toilets in the next 90
	days (the national goal is 148,000 toilets per year).</p>
<p>
	10)
	Installing toilets AND providing purified water is a two prong
	solution... Remove the disease carrying waste from the water supply
	and provide filtered water to wash hands and drink.</p>
<p>
	11)
	The third prong is education as we build there toilets... Only 30%
	of the population washed hands after defication and only 12% use
	soap. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Over
600 toilets have been built already. We can go back to this installed
base immediately to install water filters. 
</p>
<p>
<b>It's
difficult to describe how life saving these filters are... Anything
you can get will save lives, NOW.  </b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>There are so many seemingly unsolvable problems in the world, but clean water is not one of them.

4 WATER

The
Kite 4 Water team is taking the first step for the kiteboarding
industry to bring clean water access to people all around the world.
 

Our
mission is simple: bring clean water access to every single
person that needs it.  Our campaign involves identifying
communities world-wide that need clean water, traveling to these
regions that are in need, connecting with community leaders to
distribute water filters, and educating the communities on filter
uses and functionality.  We will also be documenting every
trip to share each community's story and the life-changing impact
that these filters have.
Donations & sponsorships go directly to purchase & distribution of filters. 






Clean
water project: NEPAL UPDATE

Our
clean water ambassador Khris Loux is currently in Nepal building
septic tanks, toilets, clean water filtration systems, and helping to
educated people on proper hygiene in the aftermath of natural
disasters.



	1)
	The government pumps water but does NOT purify, so the water is not
	safe. (This is why our filter systems are so important.)

	2)
	The earthquake destroyed or severely damaged 600k homes and 5k
	public buildings.

	3)
	Displaced people are living under tarps, in man-made temporary
	housing and have no toilets or running water.

	4)
	The result is open defecation which leaches into the ground water
	creating high probabilities of outbreak of disease.

	5)
	Prior to the earthquake 10,500+ children where dying EVERY YEAR from
	diarrhea, caused by contaminated water.  (Preventable with the
	filtration systems.) The risk of this number greatly increasing
	this year is very real.

	7)
	Compounding the problem is the blockaded of fuel by India two months
	ago. (India is reacting to Nepal's recent Constitution.)

	8)
	Fact from Nepal Progress Report: 50% of population, 16m people,
	practices open defecation, 80% of communicable diseases are a result
	of contaminated water.

	9)
	We are working on a project to install 700 toilets in the next 90
	days (the national goal is 148,000 toilets per year).

	10)
	Installing toilets AND providing purified water is a two prong
	solution... Remove the disease carrying waste from the water supply
	and provide filtered water to wash hands and drink.

	11)
	The third prong is education as we build there toilets... Only 30%
	of the population washed hands after defication and only 12% use
	soap. 
	





Over
600 toilets have been built already. We can go back to this installed
base immediately to install water filters. 


It's
difficult to describe how life saving these filters are... Anything
you can get will save lives, NOW.  

There are so many seemingly unsolvable problems in the world, but clean water is not one of them. More on our project at www.kite4water.org

Photos from Nepal.








We have been working with other organizations that have already brought millions clean water access (YES millions)  in just the past few years, using the same techniques that we are implementing.  
Each filter brings 100 people clean water for 5+ years.  This means that on a single trip we need to transfer only two hundred filters to bring over 20,000 people clean water access.  


Our first goal is to get clean water access to 1,000,000 people and rally the entire industry to take advanced portable water filtration systems when traveling. We can do this in 2016, with your help!



SAWYER FILTERS

Other NGOs have distributed clean water for 8,000,000 people and counting.

We were inspired by Sawyer filters and the organizations they work with.  These are small teams of amazing individuals bringing millions of people around the world access to clean water in only a few short years.  



We are the first group to replicate what they have started, and we will not be the last. 


As we begin our work in Central America this winter, we will make powerful video documentaries that will inspire thousands of traveling kiteboarders and surfers to join the cause. 
Every location we travel to, we will also be meeting with kiteboarding and surfing schools to help us promote this amazing cause and expand our network, making it easier for travelers to distribute the clean water systems. 

Co-Founders of Kite4Water.org, Scott Gordon and Jeff Kafka, have traveled the world surfing and kiteboarding their entire lives, and now want to use those skills and network of locals in each region of the world to raise money and awareness to bring millions of people clean water. 


1 filtration system is only $50, and brings 100 people clean water everyday for FIVE YEARS or more.  That's 50 cents to bring 1 person clean water for 5 years+. These advanced filters have a removal rate of 99.99999% for bacteria which cause Cholera, Botulism,Typhoid, Ameobic Dysentery, E. Coli, Coliform Bacteia, Streptococus, Salmonella, and much more. 
Children and elderly are the most susceptible to these illnesses. 
760,000 children under the age of 5 died last year due to Diarrheal infections, and almost all of them could have been prevented. This is senseless death.  Millions of people travel the globe for pleasure, and they could be helping to provide clean water access to communities in need (from the WHO website).RAISING MONEYDonate filtersThey best way to help our project is to donate a filter or ten! 

For every filter donated, you are brining 100 people clean water for five years+.
Every single donation makes a difference, for every 50 cents, 1 person will receive clean water for 5 years+. We will e-mail you a gift certificate immediately upon your donation/ purchase (before the fundraiser ends).
You can donate in someone else's name if you want to give this as a gift for the holidays!


ApparelProceeds go to purchase filtration systems and support our upcoming trips. Help us spread this amazing cause, wear your limited edition T-shirt or sweatshirt with pride.

IMPACT & DOCUMENTARIES Not only are we going to take filtration systems on every trip, we are also going to make a documentary of the trip and film everything from delivering the filters, surfing, and kiteboarding.  

The idea is inspire people to travel with purpose, and change their mindset about how they travel. You don't have to drop everything and join the peace corps, do what you love and help along the way. This is people helping people.
We are going to take the kiteboarding industry by storm, and show people how they CAN make a difference!

My clients range from high schoolers to collegiates to the members of the NFL, MLB, NBA and even the Olympics. I also have experience as a designer, in retail sales, team management, product tester, R&amp;D, and for a wearable computer company (Xybernaut), where I conceived, designed, sourced and manufactured products from conception to completion using both domestic and foreign manufacturing companies. <a href=""http://www.thecorefacility.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thecorefacility.com</a> is how to find out more about who I am.</p><h3><b>WHY EVO? AND WHO IS IT FOR?</b></h3><p><b><b><i></i></b></b></p><p><strong><em>Because there is an easier and better way to develop superior athletic strength, speed, performance and a healthier and stronger overall body without adding more time in the Gym</em><strong>.</strong> </strong>This garment was designed primarily for the athlete and to address the overdevelopment of certain areas of the body due to improper training or unrecognized imbalances. It was designed to mitigate injury by addressing parts of the body that are missed or cannot be adequately developed unless the individual is in the motion of their activity. The EVO suit is akin to training in an atmosphere with higher gravity but a gravity that can be increased ever so slightly so that the body and most importantly, the connective tissues can grow without compounding damage. It mimics body development the way we were meant to gain strength or lose weight, Incrementally. This development is accomplished gradually by ounces, which eventually turn to pounds. The best thing about the EVO garment is that an athlete can wear this garment while doing the sport or activity they play and have no restrictions in movement! This ability allows for TRUE functional and SPORT SPECIFIC muscle and connective tissue development! The EVO weighted compression suit, this is the answer to better performance!  </p><p>Though it's initial design was based on increasing the functional development of the athlete, people of ALL ages from the athlete to the fitness enthusiast to the everyday man and woman to grandma and granddad can benefit from the EVO. It's for everyone who wants to get healthier, stronger, faster, fitter, or to just lose some weight in less time and without so much strain on the joints. With the EVO compression wear and its graduated weight cells, its antibacterial and UV protecting fabric that wicks away sweat, it  will allow all of your everyday movements to burn more calories and work the entire body throughout the day. You can wear it under your clothes and gain strength and lose weight as you go through your daily routine. It's a game-changer!</p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span><p><b><b><i>It's great for our senior generation</i></b>, </b>to aid in building muscle as they walk, shop or do any activity. Every step you take becomes a workout. <b><b><i>The fitness enthusiast or the amature or professional athlete</i></b> </b>can actually grow faster and stronger while doing the sport or activity they love.</p><p><b><b><i>EVO also has HEALTH and recovery related properties.</i></b></b> EVO is a true compression garment that aids in alleviating fatigue. An added bonus to this invention is that the cells can be heated or cooled and re-inserted into the garment to cool or heat an area after training. (I am currently looking into providing separate cells for this purpose so they can be ready directly after training)</p><h3><b>HOW YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELPS</b></h3><p>Your support enables us to find the right manufacturers with the ability needed to bring this product to market and into your hands.

<h3><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b></h3>
<p>The inherent risks related to large-scale production of a new patented product of this type, are significantly reduced because of our products proven and tested base layer which is a compression garment. All components to EVO are existing components, they are being arranged and adjusted in a manner never done before. I am confident that it's all fully attainable. After all, I put it together myself without the skills of the professionals who do this daily. Though I am providing a brand new innovation in strength development, I am extremely optimistic that with your support and patience, I can deliver a product which will provide a new experience for all Indiegogo backers!</p>
<h3><b>WHY THE NAME EVO?</b></h3>
<p>The EVO is an abbreviation of both <b>Evo</b>lution and R<b>evo</b>lution, because EVO is both revolutionary in its concept and is an evolution of the current weighted garments. Also, EVO will <b>evo</b>lve to more functional garments throughout the coming years.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>IS EVO WASHABLE?</b></h3>
<p>The EVO is Machine safe and washes with your current workout garments (just remove the weights).  </p>
<h3><b>HOW MANY WEIGHTED CELLS DO I GET?</b></h3>
<p>Each EVO comes with 20 lbs of weighted cells. Each cell is linked to form a chain of 12. Extra cells can be ordered in increments of 20 lbs.</p>
<h3><b>IS THERE AN AGE LIMIT?</b></h3>
<p>EVO is for ALL ages! The precaution is that the use of the weighted cells must be graduated slowly. It's perfect for any age group - children, parents, grandparents, amature athlete, Professional athlete, weight loss, muscle gain, anyone. (initial EVO'S will be made at our already prescribed adult sizes)</p>
<h3>WHAT ARE THE SIZES?</h3>
<p>The EVO comes in sizes based on measurements of an individual's calf, thigh, Hip, forearm, bicep, chest.  This is because the fit must be like a second skin so the weighted cells stay where they must for comfort and optimal performance. Sizes are XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL. (we will be looking to assess the viability of making custom sizes because we know that as a people, we come in many sizes)</p>
<h3><b>WHAT ARE THE COLORS?</b></h3>

</div></div>","MY STORY...I am a figurative artist and a former athlete who has become a sports performance trainer for the last 25 plus years. My clients range from high schoolers to collegiates to the members of the NFL, MLB, NBA and even the Olympics. I also have experience as a designer, in retail sales, team management, product tester, R&D, and for a wearable computer company (Xybernaut), where I conceived, designed, sourced and manufactured products from conception to completion using both domestic and foreign manufacturing companies. www.thecorefacility.com is how to find out more about who I am.WHY EVO? AND WHO IS IT FOR?Because there is an easier and better way to develop superior athletic strength, speed, performance and a healthier and stronger overall body without adding more time in the Gym. This garment was designed primarily for the athlete and to address the overdevelopment of certain areas of the body due to improper training or unrecognized imbalances. It was designed to mitigate injury by addressing parts of the body that are missed or cannot be adequately developed unless the individual is in the motion of their activity. The EVO suit is akin to training in an atmosphere with higher gravity but a gravity that can be increased ever so slightly so that the body and most importantly, the connective tissues can grow without compounding damage. It mimics body development the way we were meant to gain strength or lose weight, Incrementally. This development is accomplished gradually by ounces, which eventually turn to pounds. The best thing about the EVO garment is that an athlete can wear this garment while doing the sport or activity they play and have no restrictions in movement! This ability allows for TRUE functional and SPORT SPECIFIC muscle and connective tissue development! The EVO weighted compression suit, this is the answer to better performance!  Though it's initial design was based on increasing the functional development of the athlete, people of ALL ages from the athlete to the fitness enthusiast to the everyday man and woman to grandma and granddad can benefit from the EVO. It's for everyone who wants to get healthier, stronger, faster, fitter, or to just lose some weight in less time and without so much strain on the joints. With the EVO compression wear and its graduated weight cells, its antibacterial and UV protecting fabric that wicks away sweat, it  will allow all of your everyday movements to burn more calories and work the entire body throughout the day. You can wear it under your clothes and gain strength and lose weight as you go through your daily routine. It's a game-changer!It's great for our senior generation, to aid in building muscle as they walk, shop or do any activity. Every step you take becomes a workout. The fitness enthusiast or the amature or professional athlete can actually grow faster and stronger while doing the sport or activity they love.EVO also has HEALTH and recovery related properties. EVO is a true compression garment that aids in alleviating fatigue. An added bonus to this invention is that the cells can be heated or cooled and re-inserted into the garment to cool or heat an area after training. (I am currently looking into providing separate cells for this purpose so they can be ready directly after training)HOW YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELPSYour support enables us to find the right manufacturers with the ability needed to bring this product to market and into your hands. Components such as the weight cells, the gloves, socks and head wear must also be produced to fully compliment the project. There are many parts to the EVO bodywear and sourcing each component takes time and funding. You will be providing the means to creating the final look and feel of the fabric and it's cell placements. Your support will aid in realizing production capacity, help ascertain and reduce lead times and fund the overall development of this new revolutionary product.  Your contribution is greatly appreciated and I look forward to showing you how amazing this product truly is.EXCLUSIVE EVO T-SHIRT PERKFRONTBACKBRACELET
