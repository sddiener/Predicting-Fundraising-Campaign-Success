We have spent over two years figuring out what that bag would look like, and we are finally ready to produce it.</p><p>We have also realized that in order to meet the needs of our customers, we need to expand our product line and design and produce the products that have been asked for and suggested to us.</p><p>In response, we have created a new line of leather products that will meet those needs and suggestions! <b>Sourced from 100% genuine buffalo leather.</b></p><h1><b>Why Buffalo Leather?</b></h1><ul><li><b>Buffalo leather is superior to cow leather in several manners. According to Rocky Mountain Tanners, buffalo leather is more resistant to damage from ripping, stretching and excessive heat. It's also more breathable than cow leather, making it better for a wider range of temperatures. </b></li></ul><div> </div><ul><li><b>Buffalo leather is frequently used in military gear. Furniture and clothing benefit from buffalo leather's durability and ease of maintenance. Buffalo leather also has a distinctive texture that makes it sought-after for all sorts of aesthetic purposes. It possesses a ""pebbly"" appearance that works well for coats or briefcase covers. Buffalo leather can even be maintained with conditioners meant for cow leather; it requires no special care compared to other kinds of leather.</b></li></ul><div> </div><ul><li><b>In it's natural state, the buffalo hide is thicker than the cowhide.</b></li></ul><p>With your support and pledging towards our Kodiak Leather products, you will be making a HUGE difference in the Kodiak Leather manufacturing process, and will help us make these leather items available to everyone.</p><h1><b>The new product line includes:</b></h1><ul>

We have spent over two years figuring out what that bag would look like, and we are finally ready to produce it.We have also realized that in order to meet the needs of our customers, we need to expand our product line and design and produce the products that have been asked for and suggested to us.In response, we have created a new line of leather products that will meet those needs and suggestions! Sourced from 100% genuine buffalo leather.Why Buffalo Leather?Buffalo leather is superior to cow leather in several manners. According to Rocky Mountain Tanners, buffalo leather is more resistant to damage from ripping, stretching and excessive heat. It's also more breathable than cow leather, making it better for a wider range of temperatures.  Buffalo leather is frequently used in military gear. Furniture and clothing benefit from buffalo leather's durability and ease of maintenance. Buffalo leather also has a distinctive texture that makes it sought-after for all sorts of aesthetic purposes. It possesses a ""pebbly"" appearance that works well for coats or briefcase covers. Buffalo leather can even be maintained with conditioners meant for cow leather; it requires no special care compared to other kinds of leather. In it's natural state, the buffalo hide is thicker than the cowhide.With your support and pledging towards our Kodiak Leather products, you will be making a HUGE difference in the Kodiak Leather manufacturing process, and will help us make these leather items available to everyone.The new product line includes:

<p>We were inspired to create Foot Flops after experiencing all of the advancements made in insole technology. As avid skiers and snowboarders, we saw how comfortable heat-molded inserts are and instantly realized all the benefits they provided for our feet and overall body. We wanted this comfort to be available to you, and not just when you’re on the slopes. This is why we decided to create Foot Flops.</p>
<p>1. No break-in time = super comfortable straight out of the oven.</p>
<p>2.  Superior arch support = less back pain and foot lengthening over time.</p>

As a result of his upbringing in a mountain town, Jamie developed a preference for THE best gear and clothing for his lifestyle. Ski orthotics became a must-have for instant comfort in the winter, but he wanted an instantly comfortable pair of flip flops going into summer.

</div>","Please visit our new website for future orders here...www.footflops.com.  Thank you from the Foot Flops Team! Introducing Foot Flops™ Foot Flops™ are the first high-quality, heat-molded, orthotic and arch-supporting flip flops on the market. Foot Flops will provide users with instant comfort without the painful break-in time that comes with regular flip flops.

 Sunrise Model - Heat Molded

In The Press

 
We were inspired to create Foot Flops after experiencing all of the advancements made in insole technology. As avid skiers and snowboarders, we saw how comfortable heat-molded inserts are and instantly realized all the benefits they provided for our feet and overall body. We wanted this comfort to be available to you, and not just when you’re on the slopes. This is why we decided to create Foot Flops.
1. No break-in time = super comfortable straight out of the oven.
2.  Superior arch support = less back pain and foot lengthening over time.
3. Higher-end design and fashionable = you look super cool!
Foot Flops are Perfect for Every Place & Activity:


 Hit the Road with Foot Flops!

 Green Fade Grey - Great for any adventure
75% of Americans will experience foot problems at one time or another in their lives. Traditional flip flops do not address these issues in any way. Foot Flops are the solution to traditional flip flops!

started by collecting many testimonials from people, including some that are
still afraid of the water many years later, forcing them to stay on the shore
while their friends and family are having fun... 

<b><b><b><blockquote><p>“I was 50 m from the shore with my boys blocked in the
current and we didn’t know what to do ! We got lucky when someone came with a
surf board to help us back to the beach.""</p></blockquote></b></b></b><p>
</p><p>One of the problem is that a lot of people feel that the existing products on

advice always given by sport coaches, professional rescue, relaxation or stress experts
all over the world.<br/>
</blockquote>Why ? Simply because breathing out as much as CO2 as possible will help you to relax rapidly, to slow down your heart beat, to stop feeling out of air and focus your mind on a simple task and not on the distressing situation.<b><b><b><br/><br/></b></b></b><p><b><b>       For each breath you take you instantly feel

(Please keep in mind that our products are not meant to
replace lifesaving devices, always wear a life-jacket when recommended)
3 Simple steps and your emergency buoy is ready to help a
conscious person in distress in the water:
Specifications and Advantages :
- The bags are build out of recyclable materials (PE) that
naturally float,
- 2 Be There bags (4 bottles) meet the minimum flotation capability of 6 Liters
of air (buoyancy) enough to help a conscious person of 100 kg in the water,
- The Standard PET bottles that are used instead of an inflatable Nylon/TPU
buoyancy chamber can resist the same minimum pressure of 100 PSI,
- If the buoyancy chambers (bottles) are damage, well it’s easy to
replace them,
- It can be used in most situations involving people close to the water,
- It’s resistant to shock, tears, scratches, bites and other damages...
- It’s low cost makes it accessible to everyone from high to low income
countries...Inflatable Buoys and Advice with you
when you need them most!Early on during the design process of the prototypes, we
started by collecting many testimonials from people, including some that are
still afraid of the water many years later, forcing them to stay on the shore
while their friends and family are having fun... 

“I was 50 m from the shore with my boys blocked in the
current and we didn’t know what to do ! We got lucky when someone came with a
surf board to help us back to the beach.""
One of the problem is that a lot of people feel that the existing products on
the market don’t match with their activities, needs or budgets!(Please keep in mind that our products are not meant to
replace lifesaving devices, always wear a life-jacket when recommended)
That’s when we set out to provide answers to several of these issues at
once with an adapted range of inflatable products. Jump Top:        > Be There     > Be Ready       > Be Seen      > Price List
Meet the ""Be Ready"" inflatable buoys(Patent Pending)01 - To make personal flotation devices (PFD’s) as simple, accessible
and         affordable as possible, allowing you to Be Ready to help yourself or         someone else in case of emergency!
02 - To design a product that is so compact and light          that you
don’t even feel it when you swim, surf, dive or even walk... 
The “Be Ready PFD's” are covered with 2 ""potentially life saving” tips easy to apply, directly printed on the fabric. The definition and selection of the content has been done with professional swimming coaches and lifeguards.    Fighting the currents, hyper ventilating and exhaustion can
easily lead                                              to drowning incidents !We designed our inflatable solutions specifically to
empower swimmers and water enthusiast of all levels, to be able to help themselves
or someone else in case of emergency...All our products have a minimum of 6 Liters of inflatable volume, enough to help keeping afloat a conscious swimmer of 100 Kg.The ""Be Ready 11 L"" can easily carry up to 2 conscious adultsat the same time !
03 - To combine in one simple action : Inflating  =  Floating  =  Relaxing,         while providing you with practical advice at the moment you 
need it most,It only takes an average of 9 to 15 seconds to inflate !
6L of Air = 2 to 3 deep breaths for most adults
04 - During our workshops with experts we understood that
removing the CO2          automatic inflator would actually bring you quite a few
advantages:

- It makes the products much lighter, more compact and less
expensive,

- No need to buy expensive CO2 cartridges to re-arm the
product,
- No need to learn how to repack the product following
complex steps of flops,
- No risk of damaging the product or hurting someone while providing assistance,Exhaling deeply and inhaling slowly is one of the first
advice always given by sport coaches, professional rescue, relaxation or stress experts
all over the world.
Why ? Simply because breathing out as much as CO2 as possible will help you to relax rapidly, to slow down your heart beat, to stop feeling out of air and focus your mind on a simple task and not on the distressing situation.       For each breath you take you instantly feel
that you are floating !
Throughout the testing sessions with children, teenagers and
adults, we confirmed that people start to feel the buoyancy from the first 2
breaths inside one of our products.

Keep in mind that this logic applies first to people that willingly
entered the water, for example: swimmers, surfers, divers,
etc...

“Be Ready Buoys” are
also a great way to have fun in the shallows, to learn to swim with a friendly
and soft product that can make the difference for less experimented swimmers
while out in the water by themselves.Remember, to always keep children under constant adult supervision
while inside or near the water. Our products are not meant to replace
lifesaving devices, always wear a life-jacket when recommended !

We have worked very hard to develop a product that truly works and is so simple to use.

Please help us get the word out there!  </p><p>If your contribution exceeds our initial goal, we will take advantage right away to improve our manufacturing processes and tools to lower the over all cost.

Lowering the manufacturing cost is the right solution for all. </p><p>We use the best and well recognized labs to manufacture our cosmetics components to match the level of sophistication of TWILASH.

What you need to know about Curling Eyelashes and Removing MascaraCurling EyelashesRemoving MascaraWho we areWe are a small group of engineers and creative people finding real solutions for the active woman, after all we are highly trained problem solvers. Our main challenge was to come up with a single solution that integrates and outperforms existing eyelash products  for enhancement, cosmetic and care. Are objective was not to find alternatives or partial solutions, our  goal was to figure out, design, and develop an engineered product that improves the life of the active women.  We are very passionate about TWILASH and so happy to see this ambitious project come to life. EARN A FREE TWILASH! SEE REWARD PROGRAM BELOWYour contribution is very important to help us make people aware that a great product like this now exists. We have worked very hard to develop a product that truly works and is so simple to use. However, new and better concepts/methods need to be exposed to people so they can easily understand how it works and what it does. Please help us get the word out there!  If your contribution exceeds our initial goal, we will take advantage right away to improve our manufacturing processes and tools to lower the over all cost. As you know new ideas require a lot of pricy customization, research and development. We have made it across the line to have the capability to mass produce TWILASH at a relatively high cost. We can only maintain this structure for a limited time without transferring the cost to the end user. Lowering the manufacturing cost is the right solution for all. We use the best and well recognized labs to manufacture our cosmetics components to match the level of sophistication of TWILASH. Prime quality is not cheap and ordering in bigger quantities will helps us maintain our fair prices. We believe in top quality at a reasonable price. If we have funds left we will not waste the opportunity to do this. So, what is TWILASH? Simple! Integration and outperformance of what you have today for your eyelashes. These are the main solutions TWILASH will be giving: Enhancement: Giving shaping memory to the eyelashes is not just the best way to make them alive, it also increases dramatically the beautifying capabilities of the mascara. Proper shaping in not just limited to looks, it increases mascara performance and application.Natural Curling: Conventional curlers are a thing of the past. Let us forget about the spider leg look (bended and uneven) eyelashes and start enjoying natural, continuous curl and elongated eyelashes. The unique curling features will bring great results without the need of mechanical devices that only hurt the eyes, destroy the anatomy of the lashes and are difficult to clean, carry and maintain.Alignment and Separation: Based on TWILASH's shaping memory capabilities, this product aligns and separates those rebel eyelashes. This process not just gives volume to the eyelashes before mascara, it also eases the application of it. It is proven that mascara cannot correct al imperfections and is limited to the state of the eyelashes. TWILASH improves results by enhancing the eyelashes prior to mascara.Prevents Premature Aging and Irritations: TWILASH does not just seek beauty, it cares for you by helping to prevent premature aging, infections, irritations and raccoon eyes.  Compact, Portable & All in One: One device that can be taken everywhere with the power to do everything. Ergonomic: This is a contribution of physiology, engineering, biomechanics, industrial design, graphic design, statistics, and operations research. This means it is a product that fits naturally in the hand and operates effectively using only the body's cognitive abilities. Mascara & Make-Up Remover: The specially designed mascara remover brings the most effective and convenient way to remove mascara, especially water resistant mascara.   In combination with twilash, the cotton mechanically removes even the toughest mascara without rubbing sensitive and fragile skin areas. Avoiding these areas is the best way to fight premature aging.Mascara: We did not reinvent mascara but did make sure to develop the highest quality mascara for you. Our formulas have been developed in California (USA) to equal the level of sophistication of TWILASH. Best of all, TWILASH and mascara come integrated in a single compact design, like the conventional mascara.Engineered Brush & Applicator: Our engineered brush is designed to give optimal performance when it comes to mascara application and results. In addition, TWILASH is ergonomically designed to improve brush control when used as a mascara applicator. TWILASH is not just a beauty project. It is a CARE product that removes macara, does not damage your lashes and helps prevent premature aging.

I work with music, language, lists, etc. This campaign is basically a pre-order of the All Known Metal Bands t-shirt. AKMB is a book that was published in 2008 that lists every heavy metal band name of all time. It sold 10,000 copies, Rolling Stone loved it, it won a design award, Amazon loved it and you probably love it too. This is the 6 year anniversary and I'm finally getting around to making a shirt that lists all the names from the book that start with ""black."" Hallelujah!

If you've ever found yourself in need of a humorous t-shirt but don't want to look like a tourist in some baggy, scratchy shirt that says ""Property of Alcatraz"" or ""1 Tequila, 2 Tequila, 3 Tequila, Floor"", then Custom Flotilla is for you.

<p>Rebecca heads our creative workshop dept., with a passion for design and education. “In our first store, we graduated over a dozen University design students from our fashion internship, preparing them for the industry they were moving into. They learned basic retail concepts, supply &amp; manufacturing practices in a global market, how to create a brand and market it- I didn't learn some of these things in my degree program and felt like the store offered an authentic learning &amp; design space.”</p>
<p>Rebecca launched Elk Neck, a jewelry line, in 2013. ""I love earrings so much that I started making them. Then people wanted to know where I got my earrings and if I sold them. Next thing I know, I'm teaching myself about metals, learning how to solder."" Rebecca moved to Philadelphia in 1999 and co-founded ROCKERS! along with Camae Ayewa, a monthly live music series that spanned 10 years. </p>

<p>Original store Sept. 2011</p>
<p>""Essentially you could come in, buy affordable clothing, have it altered in-store as a customer. Our selection featured curated vintage, thrift and original apparel. In our workshop, our free internship offered: design skills, access to equipment &amp; resources, and an avenue to sell your designs directly to the public. The space often featured clothing &amp; accessory designs of several rotating independent artists. In order to introduce a new designer to the public, we hosted launch events or open houses. During these events, guests could participate in live art activities, such as block printing. People came to shop as much as they came to learn about other artists, or participate in events or workshops. As we grew, people wanted more of it.""</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>We believe that creative &amp; artistic endeavors should be accessible. Our goal to is to expand our current vision and open a larger space, Rockers Closet Bazaar, to continue our work. “We combine the sustainable practices of carrying handmade/original works, vintage, and thrift with creative initiatives. In a time where many artists’ work is co-opted with ease by commercial brands, we strive to designate a space that is dedicated to promoting original works in which marginalized artists have both visibility &amp; creative control- RC Bazaar is an arts cornerstone of its community. “</p>
<h2>What happens in the space</h2>
<h2>Retail</h2>
<p>Independent original designs, curated thrift &amp; vintage</p>

Behind the Scenes (1 min)


 

Rebecca
~Artist, self-taught jewelry designer, educator, co-founder of ROCKERS music movement~

Rebecca heads our creative workshop dept., with a passion for design and education. “In our first store, we graduated over a dozen University design students from our fashion internship, preparing them for the industry they were moving into. They learned basic retail concepts, supply & manufacturing practices in a global market, how to create a brand and market it- I didn't learn some of these things in my degree program and felt like the store offered an authentic learning & design space.”
Rebecca launched Elk Neck, a jewelry line, in 2013. ""I love earrings so much that I started making them. Then people wanted to know where I got my earrings and if I sold them. Next thing I know, I'm teaching myself about metals, learning how to solder."" Rebecca moved to Philadelphia in 1999 and co-founded ROCKERS! along with Camae Ayewa, a monthly live music series that spanned 10 years. 
Vision for retail workshop


Rebecca and D.A. Hamid of OGNK joined forces early on to launch the events that became a major aspect of the company. Events included branding & marketing independent designers, art workshops/open house free to the public, fashion shows, and styled photo shoots.

OGNK~  all original art and apparel is the schtick. Our motto is “Go ahead, Be different!” Something that will hold true to our (and our fans’) true vision which is to not be afraid to break the mold of conformity and hyper normalization. 
OGNK features classic sportswear, original streetwear, headwear and accessories. All weather. All style. All day.

Our Story
We opened our doors in Philadelphia in 2011 on Fabric Row, and spent 3 years creating a burgeoning hub for artists, designers, and creatives in our city. We combined a powerful mix of retail, original designs created in our onsite workshop, and creative events.

Original store Sept. 2011
""Essentially you could come in, buy affordable clothing, have it altered in-store as a customer. Our selection featured curated vintage, thrift and original apparel. In our workshop, our free internship offered: design skills, access to equipment & resources, and an avenue to sell your designs directly to the public. The space often featured clothing & accessory designs of several rotating independent artists. In order to introduce a new designer to the public, we hosted launch events or open houses. During these events, guests could participate in live art activities, such as block printing. People came to shop as much as they came to learn about other artists, or participate in events or workshops. As we grew, people wanted more of it.""
 



Arty Party June 2012
""To celebrate the launch of independent designers in our store, we hosted an Arty Party. In the June launch, guests learned to make African Print Bowtie Earrings, and created Tutu's from remnants of fabric.""

Vision
We believe that creative & artistic endeavors should be accessible. Our goal to is to expand our current vision and open a larger space, Rockers Closet Bazaar, to continue our work. “We combine the sustainable practices of carrying handmade/original works, vintage, and thrift with creative initiatives. In a time where many artists’ work is co-opted with ease by commercial brands, we strive to designate a space that is dedicated to promoting original works in which marginalized artists have both visibility & creative control- RC Bazaar is an arts cornerstone of its community. “
What happens in the space
Retail
Independent original designs, curated thrift & vintage


Resident Designers OGNK, Elk Neck & "" "" continue to create the independent collections out of RC Bazaar. These collections are original design mainstays of our space.

We are committed to sustainable retail, and understand the impact of high demands for cheap clothing in today's global market. Focusing on worn inventory allows us to lessen that demand while delivering high-quality items.""
Events

Often, our events include a hands-on aspect or interactive component. RC features artists that teach guests a specific art technique, such as block printing, weaving, quilting, batik, etc. Preservation of hands-on art forms and indigenous/folk art techniques are the focus.  

In the past we have featured music performances, photography collections, and fashion shows/makeovers.

I'm Claire Cassidy and I've been handcrafting fluffy glowing LED costume cat ears for humans purrfessionally for several years. I've sold them at comic cons, anime conventions and festivals up and down the west coast and shipped them all over the world. The number one request I get is for the ability to change the LED to any color, a feat previously technologically unattainable. Until meow. I've done it. I've finally done it! I've updated the LED design for this proven, well loved concept and I'm creating this campaign to spread glowing cat ears to the world in a larger quantity and at a lower price then I will ever be able to offer them later on, while still keeping them quality, handcrafted and purrfect!<br/><br/>So meow that you know they exist, don't you dare tell me you've never wanted glowing cat ears. I know better then that. And so do cats. And they are watching. </p>
<h2>Features</h2>
</div><div>
<h3>Color Changeable</h3>
<p>The ears use bright, long-lasting LEDs that be can be set to 12 different solid colors, 1 slow color changing rainbow LED mode, candle flicker effect, and 2 different auto-turn off timer modes via the included remote. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496114938/a25zpyrnnq5zkeiftf3g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Remote Controlled</h3>
<p>The ears are controlled by a discreet infrared remote control, and the color of the ears can be set either together or individually. One red one blue? Can do! One color changing one pink? Can do! All orange half the night and color changing the other half? Can do! Match ANY outfit or aesthetic! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0IO2jxLastNWBUY/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>BUT WE'RE NOT DONE! On the back of the remote control is a shiny mirror-like sticker You can see your reflection in to check out what color you have changed the ears to once they are already on your head. It's super useful! <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3og0IG1NhzTafLrGO4/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Fluffy!</h3>
<p>They are fluffy. That is all. Really freaking fluffy. Not molded plastic. No hard headband. No bulky battery pack. High quality faux fur. FLUFFYYYY!!! </p>

<h3>Clip-on</h3>
<p>They clip on easily to your hair or any headband you like to wear (Or let's be super real a hat, your shoes, your beard or your friends beard work too. Options!). This is made possible by the largest, most durable alligator hair clips available! Have fine hair, no hair or like to headbang a lot? Clipping them to a soft or hard headband makes them just as secure as costume headband ears. </p>

<h3>Comfortable and Adjustable</h3>
<p>Each ear has a hand-made wire frame that makes it easy to shape each one to your head, or bend the frame to change the batteries inside the LED more easily, or make the ears rounder or more pointed looking! They are easy to adjust right where you want them on your head, and most importantly without a hard plastic or wire headband they are COMFORTABLE!</p>

<h2>Tech Specs</h2>
<p>The batteries are easily replaceable due to my innovative design. Each ear uses 2 CR2032 coin cell batteries, which are standard and can be found easily in stores. Each ear has between 6 and 12 hours solid runtime, depending on which mode is being used. The LEDs are hidden inside of each ear, and can be accessed through the front panel of fur, which can be pulled open. They are turned on by twisting the top of the LED case to the left, and off by being turned right, you can also turn them on and off with the remote after they have been turned on manually initially. The remote takes 1 CR2032 coin cell battery and is replaceable. </p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Do I really need LED cat ears?</h3>
<p>Yes. Shhhhhh....In your heart you know. Yes. </p>
<h3>Can I change the batteries?</h3>
<p>Yes. EASILY. Boo yeah!</p>
<h3>I don't have hair to clip them to.</h3>
<p>That's why they come with a headband! Making them with clips just gives everyone more options, you can still clip them to any hard or soft headband and they will work just like costume headband ears.</p>
<h3>Can the LEDs in each ear be individually changed?</h3>
<p>Yep! You may need to hold one ear away from the other to get them to change separately but they are designed to do so. </p>
<h3>Will they rainbow color cycle?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! There is a button that will make them slow fade color change through all the colors. It's stunning! They will also flicker gently like a candle flame. They will NOT blink though. No blinky flashing LEDs here. </p>
<h3>Why are they so expensive?</h3>
<p>They aren't. They are handcrafted quality costuming art. You're welcome. </p>
<h3>Will you still sell your classic single LED color cat ears?</h3>
<p>Yup! Same as ever! And at the same price as usual! This will just be a new epic option moving forward. </p>

<h2>Timeline and shipping</h2>
<p>This campaign will run for 30 days and then I will start production. Goal for production is another 30-45 days, depending on the success of the campaign. Shipping goal is by mid-late August and the ears should arrive 3-10 days after that. <br/><br/>Meow some realness. I am committed to quality and in order to achieve that I will stretch my shipping timeline a bit, only if needed. Will you get them remarkably quickly for a custom handcrafted design? Yes. Will I take a bit of extra time to work out any bugs that arise in the process of making them? Yes. I believe you will be so excited upon receiving them that this is not a purrblem. <br/><br/>The ears will be packaged in a lovely gold box and includes a soft headband, remote control, batteries and instructions. </p>
<h2>Thank You</h2>
<p>From the bottom of my heart. I chose years ago to pursue a living as a handcrafted artist and every customer, every bit of support, means the world and is what keeps me going. The fact that I have even gotten this far is completely pawsome and a dream come true! <br/> </p>

<p>We blended a variety of colors for the watch hands, case, and straps;
formulating a great selection of color combinations to accommodate your

<p>The movement that powers the watch is undoubtedly the most important
component of the watch.  With that in mind, we chose a Swiss quartz
movement; Harley Ronda 763.  This reliable movement holds a battery with
approximately 40 months (3 1/3 years) of battery life.  Replacing the
battery takes no more than a few minutes with the proper tools and you can do
it at home.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461803361/9_zhlfj8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The watch has a diameter of 40mm and a lug width of 20mm.  This
versatile design fits well on the wrists of both guys and gals.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Sapphire crystal glass is used as the face of the watch.  Sapphire
is the 2nd hardest substance found on Earth, surpassed only by diamond.
 This premium material makes the glass exceptionally resistant against
scratches.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461803405/11_zp43z4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We used 316L surgical-grade stainless steel throughout the construction
of the entire watch (body, caseback and screws) for maximum durability and
resilience against the elements.  Ion-plating, a form of PVD plating is
used as the plating process of Midnight and Sunrise.</p>

deliver the watches to you. Here is a list of reasons affecting this decision:</div>
<div>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Speed</b> -
After production and quality control, the watches will be transported directly
to the fulfillment center and shipped.  This means we skip the process of
bulk shipping, going through customs, and finally shipping your Valachio to
you.  With this method, we significantly reduce the total delivery time.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Safety</b> - With less steps in shipping the watches to you, there is a
reduced risk of your shipment getting lost/damaged.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Cost</b> -
Since the watches will never be bulk shipped or go through customs, we avoid
the import duties and bulk shipping cost.  This cost reduction translates
directly into the price we can offer the watches to you.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Import Duties</b> - There is a better chance of you not paying import duties.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After this Indiegogo campaign, we will use FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) to ship all
of our products so if you purchase anything from us in the future, it will be a speedy delivery!</p>

combination of ultra-thin watch hands and short metallic indexes create a
simple watch face. A variety of colors is available for the watch hands, case
and straps allowing us to build a unique and affordable watch.""
The Time Bum: ""...
the Pantiam gives you a Ronda 763, sapphire crystal, and choice of nifty calf
leather straps with quick release bars at a bargain price.""
Wrist Watch Review:
""Valachio Pantiam is a slim three-hander at a nice price.""
WatchIsThis: ""In short, the concept of Valachio is not
unique, but they do have an edge. For the price point of the Pantiam they offer
a lot of quality and that makes their watch actually come out ahead of the
pack.""
Watch Bandit:
""Well-made, luxurious minimalist watches tend to cost a small fortune, and
those that are affordable either aren’t crafted to last or just aren’t
comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Valachio Watches is seeking to
change that and finally offer an alternative modern timepiece that is
fashionable, functional and still affordable for the average man.""


If you’re someone who appreciates clean watch designs, high quality
materials and a fair price-tag, then you have come to the right place.  At
Valachio, we believe in delivering products that are:

· 
Quality - Made with
high-quality, cost-effective materials that allow us to deliver watches built to
last you a decade at a very reasonable price.
· 
Simple - Achieving aesthetical
success with a ‘less is more’ approach to product design. Using plain but
lively colors in the selection of our watch hands and calfskin straps.
· 
Affordable - Won't make a huge dent
in your wallet!





We achieved simplicity by using unique design elements like ultra-thin
watch hands and short metallic indexes to keep the watch face as clean as
possible, while still allowing for precise timekeeping with individually marked
minute ticks.

We blended a variety of colors for the watch hands, case, and straps;
formulating a great selection of color combinations to accommodate your
individualism.






The movement that powers the watch is undoubtedly the most important
component of the watch.  With that in mind, we chose a Swiss quartz
movement; Harley Ronda 763.  This reliable movement holds a battery with
approximately 40 months (3 1/3 years) of battery life.  Replacing the
battery takes no more than a few minutes with the proper tools and you can do
it at home.


The watch has a diameter of 40mm and a lug width of 20mm.  This
versatile design fits well on the wrists of both guys and gals.




Sapphire crystal glass is used as the face of the watch.  Sapphire
is the 2nd hardest substance found on Earth, surpassed only by diamond.
 This premium material makes the glass exceptionally resistant against
scratches.


We used 316L surgical-grade stainless steel throughout the construction
of the entire watch (body, caseback and screws) for maximum durability and
resilience against the elements.  Ion-plating, a form of PVD plating is
used as the plating process of Midnight and Sunrise.


A large and flat caseback along with curved sides make for a comfortable
wearing experience. Battery changes and repairs are made accessible with a
caseback that is held together with four screws, allowing for easy access to
the quartz movement with a flathead screwdriver.




Valachio Pantiam comes with a water resistant rating of 5 ATM, meaning
it should have no problems engaging daily tasks like washing dishes or
surviving an unfortunate trip through the washing machine.





With your Valachio, you have the option between a calfskin strap or a
stainless steel mesh strap. The straps are 87.5mm in length for the
shorter section and 115mm in length for the longer section. They have a width
of 20mm at the widest point.

Our leather straps are natural, vegetable-tanned full grain calfskin
sourced from Italy.  They feel nice and soft to the touch and wraps
comfortably around your wrist.  As they are made of 100% calfskin, they're
extremely durable and also resistant against water.  They also smell
pretty good... if you like the smell of leather.




Our stainless steel mesh straps are made of 316L stainless steel, the
same material used in the construction of the watch itself.




We upgraded all of our straps to include quick release pins.  These
pins allow you to interchange between straps in just seconds.  No more
strap changing tools, just your fingernails and our quick release pins.


To receive additional straps with your watch, add the pledge amount
specified in the pledge tier. You get access to 2 additional calfskin color
options when you pledge for a separate strap; white and red.


If you pledge for an extra calfskin strap, you will be able to choose
from any of the 3 buckle options.  Our buckles are also made from 316L
stainless steel.


All Valachio Pantiams come with drilled lugs.  If the quick release
pin malfunctions or if you want to use a third party strap without a quick
release pin, you can remove the strap with a simple pushpin.  Our calfskin
strap's buckle also come with a drilled hole, allowing you to swap the buckle
for a different color, or replace it with a butterfly deployment clasp if you
prefer.




Your Italian calfskin strap can accommodate wrist sizes from 14.5 -
21.25 centimeters.




With a flathead screwdriver, your stainless steel mesh strap can be
adjusted to fit virtually any wrist size.






On the back of every Valachio, the month and year of the watch's
production are imprinted, along with the production run number. Each watch will
be serialized, along with the total number of watches manufactured in the production
run.  This means your Valachio will be (just a little) unique!  Oh,
and a bonus Lord of the Rings reference!





We're offering a total of 8 models for this Indiegogo campaign.
 Our large variety means each Valachio Pantiam is better suited for a
certain setting.  For example, we recommend the 'Sterling | Black Calf'
for more dressy occasions and the 'Sunrise | Blue Calf' to go with casual

You will choose your model(s) in a survey shortly after the campaign.

year warranty against defects.  Visit the Warranty section of our website for additional
information.



















We decided to use a fulfillment center based in Shenzhen, China to
deliver the watches to you. Here is a list of reasons affecting this decision:

· 
Speed -
After production and quality control, the watches will be transported directly
to the fulfillment center and shipped.  This means we skip the process of
bulk shipping, going through customs, and finally shipping your Valachio to
you.  With this method, we significantly reduce the total delivery time.
· 
Safety - With less steps in shipping the watches to you, there is a
reduced risk of your shipment getting lost/damaged.
· 
Cost -
Since the watches will never be bulk shipped or go through customs, we avoid
the import duties and bulk shipping cost.  This cost reduction translates
directly into the price we can offer the watches to you.
· 
Import Duties - There is a better chance of you not paying import duties.

After this Indiegogo campaign, we will use FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) to ship all
of our products so if you purchase anything from us in the future, it will be a speedy delivery!




Thank you for reading up until this point of our Indiegogo InDemand campaign.
 We hope you love our watches as much as we do!  If you have any
questions for us, free feel to contact us through any of these outlets:

· 
Sending a message through Indiegogo
· 
Emailing us at support@valachio.com
· 
Reach us at any of our social media

We managed to successfully surpass our stretch goal of $20,000 CAD in the original Kickstarter campaign which means you now have access to one additional model, the Saltire!  It features a polished stainless steel case with blue watch hands.

With the Saltire, you will have the option between a blue calfskin strap
and a silver mesh strap.",52.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>The aquabook genius formula: uniqueness = knowledge x style²</b></p>
<p>Staying
 hydrated is the key to performance, whether physical or intellectual - a
 lack of water is a lack of brainpower. Drinking eight to ten cups of 
water a day can improve your levels of cognitive performance by up to 
30%. Therefore it is crucial to carry your water with you - wherever you
 are - whatever you do!<br/> Due to its genuine A5 format 
it fits easily in your bag, purse or briefcase. The
aquabook has a sleek design that perfectly matches your style. You can also combine your favorite aquabook 
and cap color freely to go along with your individual design. Make it 
YOUR aquabook!<br/>Designed and manufactured in Germany, it is 100% BPA and BPS free and of
 course long lasting due to highest quality.
We care about sustainability: did you know that 3 litres (100 fl. oz) of
 water is needed in order to produce an ordinary 1 litre (33 fl. oz) 
plastic water bottle? By using the refillable aquabook, you will not 
only reduce plastic waste, but you will also save a significant amount 
of water.<br/></p>

spent a lot of time selecting the best production partners close to our 
premises and not somewhere on the other side of the world. That ensures 
better communication as we can personally check upon the progress. 
Nevertheless, unforeseeable problems can occur – e.g. a fire or 
shortages of raw materials. However, we will do everything we can to 
meet deadlines and we expect to even beat them, as we know how awful it 
is to wait for your newest acquisitions.
<br/>We will keep you updated on our progress every step of the way. 
Thus, if any difficulties occur, you'll be the first to know what is 
going on and what we'll do to address the problem. As a backer, you'll 
get full behind-the-scenes view of how we're progressing here in the 
aquabook labs.
<br/>When it comes to the product itself, our manufacturing partners and 
advisors combine more than 50 years of active blow molding experience 
and they are the best experts in their fields.
<br/>After producing viable prototypes we had various consultations with 
the raw materials manufacturer, so that we are sure that the aquabook 
and its accessories will be made on time and in the quality we - and you
 - demand. 
<br/>We see our backers as our stakeholders and it's our #1 priority to 
meet your expectations. That's why we've chosen our advisory team very 
carefully with experienced colleagues that have already managed and

Simply put. The Opes Wallet offers protection, a minimalist style and top quality leather.
www.opeswallet.com

""The new standard for a                                            SLEEK & STUNNING wallet""

""It's stylish and the quality is fantastic. I truly can't believe I've been lugging around a huge wallet in my back pocket for all of these years""



4 Limited Edition Opes Wallets





""Zeus""





""Apollo""


""Luna"" 

""Ares""*All Wallets have an inside pocket to store cards or cash*


Size Matters
The Opes Wallet is designed to carry just as many cards as a regular wallet. The minimalist wallet can carry anywhere from 1-10 cards and the cash you require for the day, at a fraction of the size. Gone are the days of a ""bulky brick"" in your back pocket.
       









RFID ProtectionProtecting one’s credit card information from theft is hardly a new or revolutionary concept. Given the emergence of RFID ‘tap’ technology embedded within modern credit cards, passports and other secure access cards makes one's personal and sensitive information extremely vulnerable.Let us show you how an ""Electronic Thief"" would compromise your information:


Cards at Risk:

Credit Cards
Debit Cards
Passport Cards 
Enhanced Drivers Licenses
Transit Cards
Access Cards

</div><div>Thank you for your support!!</div><div>Mo<br/>Founder, BeltCraft.com</div><div><br/></div></div>","Belts are the centerpiece of your outfit, yet the style hasn't changed in 50 years. It's time we take belts up a notch. 


One belt purchased= $2.00 to charity.






NOTE: Estimated delivery is DECEMBER 2014.

Sizing: We are cutting these belts to order. The best way is to do is measure a belt you own from the end to the hole you wear it on - give us that measurement. Don't include the buckle in that measurement! For our women's waist belts measure around where you want to wear it. 

We launched our website BeltCraft.com a year to bring men great options when it came to belts. Now we want to offer you more stylish American-made leather accessories by expanding into Women's belts and also new products such as watch straps and wallets. We need YOUR help to expand our production capabilities and make this dream possible. With the proceeds from this campaign we want to:

Buy our hides and buckles in bulk to increase production efficiencies

Buy new tools to produce WOMEN'S belt styles.

Produce and stock straps, loops, and buckles to offer you A-LA-CARTE belts where you can interchange your buckle or loop. 
Design and produce pre-made new styles every month with lower prices for you.








As we say, ""You may not be able to customize everything in life, but we make it possible to customize your belt."" 

1. TOP-QUALITY, MADE-IN-USA CRAFTSMANSHIP

We use full-grain leather vegetable tanned in Italy and calf suede. Our colors are made through a drum dye process - no ""painted"" leather here, which means no cracking. And of course, all of our belts are made in the USA using machines that date back 50 years. 

2. WE SELL DIRECT SO YOU ARE PAYING FOR QUALITY, NOT RETAIL MARKUPS
When you buy off the rack belts, they are marked up over 5-8X from time of production. We sell direct to you giving you more flexibility with your style and saving you from paying multiple mark-ups by retailers. You pay for quality and that's it.
3. UNLIMITED OPTIONS 

We have more belt colors and options than anyone else. You can send us a photo of your shoes, suit or dress and we will help you design a belt to perfectly match. Through this campaign we are launching our new belt design with Chicago screws. Now you can buy options a-la-carte and change out the buckles and loops when you want to. The freedom to change all parts of your belt is at now your fingertips (well, maybe with a little help from a screwdriver):


4. WHEN YOU BUY OUR BELTS, WE DONATE TO 2 GREAT CAUSES
Since our campaign is going on in October & November we wanted to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month (October) and the Movember Foundation's awareness for men's health (November). Every little bit counts. For every belt that sells we are donating $2 to charity. Here is where your donations will go:








To help us achieve our goals, we want to offer you something in return. We're launching our NEW styles exclusively through our Indiegogo campaign via our Perks and at a discount. Drumroll please......


THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! At the end of the campaign our founder Mo will send you a Thank You video. Plus you will receive a discount code for 10% off a future purchase on our website. Every bit counts and your donation will make a huge difference. *** Your unique discount code will be emailed to you.












Exclusive, new style. A slim waist belt perfect for dresses, pants and to mix & match (see perk #9). You don't have to worry about matching your jewelry with this style.Details: Full-grain vegetable tanned leather or calf suede (slate and cobalt) . Fastened with 3 snaps in the back so you can adjust the size throughout the day. No stitch.Width: 3/4"" wideColors: Brown (leather), Red (leather), Slate (suede), Black (leather), Cobalt (suede)*** We will send you an email to choose your color.

This belt represents the colors of the ""Movember"" foundation, plus it just looks really cool.Details: Full-grain vegetable tanned leather belt with contrasting stitchWidth: 1.25"" (standard) widthColors: Matte navy leather with orange stitchBuckle: Burnished silver square roller





Chukka boots are those suede boots that almost every man owns and wears during the fall. We usually see guys wearing a generic brown leather belt with these boots so we created a belt to match. Plus, the belt is the perfect width to fit in the loops of your jeans.Details: Calf suede drum dyed with matching stitchWidth: 1.5"" (jeans / casual) widthColors: Peanut suede with tan stitch.Buckle: Burnished gold square roller




New Women's Belt Style with Chicago Screws so you can mix & match! Customize your belt on BeltCraft.com - there are 50+ options available in our new women's style.

If you ask us we think its twice the quality of those ""Hermes"" or ""Feragammo"" straps, but for a fraction of the price. Perfect for jeans or with work pants. 
Sizing: Be sure to take a belt you wear and measure it from the end to the hole you wear it on. Subtract 3"" from that measurement and that is your size!** women's styles can be seen on our website at the end of the campaign


Details: Full grain vegetable leather or calf suede (navy) with white stitchWidth: 1.25"" (standard) widthColors: Tons of options to choose from on BeltCraft.com! See the bottom of the page for sample color options.*** We will send you an email with a code after the campaign to design your belt.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>About Us</h3>
   So the three of us girls have been best friends since childhood. Growing up in southern CA we found ourselves in swimwear quite often. One day at a Las Vegas pool, we were discussing the camel toe and how it plagues all us girls. We decided right then and there that we would stop at nothing untill there was a solution. Girls have enough to worry about when it comes to putting on swimwear, let's cross the camel toe off that list. Remember a true lady never reveals too much!</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>   We have been working hard to cure camel toe. We have a manufacturer to produce our ""camel toe solution"". The LLC has been created and established along with all needed copyrights. We have hired a managment team with a great mix of talent and focus. Best of all, they have the right connections to major retailers that can make No No Camel Toe a household name.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>   We are also currently collaborating with a well known youtube name (who has over 90 million veiws) to create a funny commercial that we hope will go viral. We are willing to make complete fools of ourselves in order to get the attention we need to launch No No Camel Toe. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>   This is where you come in.  We just need the funds to buy our first round of products and supplies. For your contribution we have thought out some very unique giveaways that will hopefully make you laugh. You should at least find yourself laughing at us, if not with us. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>   We plan to send out the video giveaways ASAP. The estimated completion date we have set for June is only for the giveaway products that we have to put through production. But we hope to get those out sooner than June as well.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>   How nice would it be to see more girls walking proudly in their swimwear. Imagine a beach where girls find no need to reach for a towel right after leaving the water. Every girl can relate to the issue of having a camel toe at one time or another. Wouldn't it be nice to never have to worry about it again. Camel toes not only affect those in bikinis.  Look no further than the girl taking yoga, dancers,  gymnasts, even the every day girl in slacks or shorts.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>   No No Camel toe works for every lady out there. All us girls have been guilty of doing ""the check"" at least once in our lives. Let's stop pretending there is no problem and just eliminate it. We finally found the solution and No No Camel Toe really works!</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>   If you don't have the money to purchase a perk or would find watching us any longer absolute torture, thats ok. But you might know someone who will somehow find us amusing and we could really use thier help. You can even help by sharing the knowledge that the cure is on its way. Please use the Indiegogo share tools to pass the word. Thank you for your time!</p>

Here is what users are already saying:
<p>""As a very powerful tool, Forecheck is a
useful aid that works reliably even with large projects. Forecheck has been a
valuable tool for our store relaunch and continuous website analysis,"" says Christian Giersch from <a href=""http://www.cancom.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>cancom</b></a>. cancom is a leading IT retailer in Europe.</p>

Many other companies already use Forecheck as part of our beta testing program or for projects.<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>Here is what <a href=""http://www.digitalriver.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>Digital River</b></a> says about us:<br/></span>

<p>Forecheck runs on any Windows version starting with Windows XP SP3, 32-Bit and 64-Bit. It also runs on Linux and Mac systems when a Windows emulator is used (such as Wine or Crossover). <br/></p>
<p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/604404/files/20140526031244-compatibility.png?1401099164"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/><br/><p>We also successfully  tested Forecheck within a virtual machine of Windows.

<p>Here is a video introduction to Forecheck:</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/3HPx2tppp00"" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"" width=""640""></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<p>There are 4 different versions available for different needs, mainly depending on the size of a website and the number of projects that can be stored:</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/764826/files/20140804060516-versions.png?1407157516"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/><br/><p>You can see more details <a href=""http://www.forecheck.com/shop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>on our website</b></a>.<br/></p>
<p>With Forecheck, a site analysis can last from mere minutes to a few hours for extremely large ones. An analysis can be stopped, paused or continued at any point. Reports can be generated immediately and adapted as desired!</p>
<p>Below is an example of the Benchmark Report that shows the most important results, in this case for an analysis of Google.com. This analysis took 45 minutes, about 450,000 URLs were found and 35,572 URLs were processed:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/770089/files/20140806062509-benchmark.jpg?1407331509"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>A unique feature offered by Forecheck can be seen below: The rule-based Duplicate Content analysis. It not only finds all cases of duplicate content, but also the robots information (robots.txt and Meta-Tag robots) is taken into account as well as canonical links. Based on 7 rules, every case of duplicate content is explained which greatly helps towards finding and resolving problems:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/764980/files/20140804070258-dc-report.png?1407160978"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Another example of a very unique feature: The full Text Search function that searches all data. In the following example we searched for ""indiegogo"" within all pages of the Google.com analysis and found 3 results:<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/764995/files/20140804070844-search.png?1407161324"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This search function allows you to search for the tracking code of a web analytics tool within all of the available source code so that you can check if the tracking code has been correctly implemented in all the pages. Or you can search for missing pictures for products within a Shop (since missing images in some shops don't create a 404 error message but rather show a template picture for which you can search).<p></p>
<p>Have to change a phone number on your website  and don't know where it is? Or an email address? Or perhaps you would like to search within the website of a competitor since you want to know if he is using your brand? These are just a few examples. The functions of Forecheck go far beyond SEO and enable many new possibilities for webmasters.</p>
<p>Another example: <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/4046647?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Google recently stated</a> that redirects for mobile devices must lead to a corresponding mobile page. But how can you check that? This can easily be done with Forecheck! Forecheck is like a Swiss Army knife for everyone that deals with a website or is in the SEO business.</p>
<p>The list of features and analyzed data is long (see more details at the <a href=""http://www.forecheck.com/features/forecheck-overview/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Forecheck web site</a>), so in order to get a full impression of the functions, reports and available data, please <a href=""http://www.forecheck.com/downloads/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">try Forecheck yourself</a> (here is the link to the <a href=""http://www.forecheck.de/downloads/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">German version</a>).<br/></p>
<p>The export functions (CSV or Excel) allow you to export what you see. If you want to export all of the raw data or the newly created report and its defined filters, go for it!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/765060/files/20140804073009-excel.png?1407162609"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>See the strange chars? Yes, Forecheck not only fully supports Unicode, it also converts all chars, all HTML entities and coding into the correct Unicode letters. And it does not matter if a website is written in UTF-8 or any other charset because Forecheck understands all of them!</p>
<p>Whether you can contribute or not, we would greatly appreciate your partnership in spreading the word and letting the world know about Forecheck by using the IndieGoGo share tools, blogging and so forth.</p>

<p>Some perks contain an SEO analysis and audit. Depending on the perk, it can be either a quick or deep SEO analysis for your website. We have performed such SEO analyses and website optimization for 17 years. A website analysis or audit is quite complex and contains many different aspects.</p>

This is a special offer only for this campaign and won't be offered again! We have performed hundreds of analyses for numerous companies around the world, for example Digital River and their clients.

The more money we get, the more we can invest in more developers, the faster you will get more functions and features within the upcoming updates of Forecheck!</p>
<p>One important next step is the integration of keywords into every project/analysis. Keyword-related analysis and optimization potentialities are an important part. Additionally, a content optimization feature will be released within the next few months. </p>
<p>If you pledge for an SEO and/or Usability audit, we will define the details and the schedule upfront or shortly after you have pledged.</p>

One important next step is the integration of keywords into every project/analysis. Keyword-related analysis and optimization potentialities are an important part. Additionally, a content optimization feature will be released within the next few months. 
If you pledge for an SEO and/or Usability audit, we will define the details and the schedule upfront or shortly after you have pledged.
But we also want to hear about your ideas and needs! You are not only a first mover by supporting Forecheck, you will also be a future user for generations (hopefully). 
We believe in a one-stop place for analyzing everything you need to make your website perfect. This may also include more usability analyses as well as  cooperation with other companies. But still, we want Forecheck to be the #1 solution for webmasters, SEOs and everyone who deals with websites and want to make them better. Better rankings in the search engines, better usability and no errors!

About us
We are a privately held company with offices in Munich, Germany (cyberpromote GmbH) and Wilmington, US (Forecheck LLC). Established in 1997, we were a pioneer in search engine optimization and search engine advertising. Later we added services around usability optimization and webanalytics. We started our business with the first SEO software tool in Germany called RankIt!! Later we began developing Forecheck as an in-house SEO solution since we couldn't find a software that met our needs.
We did hundreds of SEO and Usability projects with companies of different sizes and branches. Since 2002 we also served clients around the world through partners like Digital River. Help us and be part of the first movers that join our campaign. Stay ahead in the SEO business and share your opinions and ideas with us!",13.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Throughout my life, creating art in one form or another has been my driving force. In college, I fell in love with screen and block printing. While using these techniques to make t-shirts for bands and local events, it wasn't long before I became frustrated with the lack of environmentally sustainable fabric to print on. Intent on a more resourceful medium, I found an old sewing machine and taught myself how to use it. I began collecting vintage tablecloths, curtains, linens, and out of date clothing all headed for landfill. I gave these items a new purpose, first through printing and later through more nuanced reconstruction and design. These items became the original women’s wear line I dubbed Where Clothes in 2009.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/539/282/2e6e6e4e66fd0bf62c415d401d1b1707_large.jpg?1366809065"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div class=""template asset"">
<p>My line helps renew some of the 90 million pounds of clothes that end up in landfills each year. The fashion industry is one of the world’s largest polluters, and uses the second largest amount of water compared with all industries. But as the climate changes, so too will trends. Where Clothes expects to lead others in distilling the concept of design to its creative element: to take what we already have and create something new. By basing all aspects of my line from my Vermont studio, Where also avoids outsourcing to other countries where unfair labor and dangerous working conditions are rampant.</p>

<p>The <b>RC21</b> is the result of my 20 years as an expert  studying the woman consumer.

</h3> <p>We only need $15,000 to complete the Prototype and have multiple options in bringing the<b> RC21</b> to market which includes a major global beauty product brand and private equity investors.  If we raise more than our goal, we will focus on global distribution without private investors and maximize promotional visibility with our beauty brand interests.</p>
<p>The most exciting perk in our stable will be the <b>RC21</b> itself with a variety of style bracelets being offered for sale to our contributors at a reduced price.  We will offer promotional perks exposing the brand and create a great email list inviting our supporters to major events that will support and protect women.  Our plans include Las Vegas locations to the Playboy Mansion to benefit charities that protect women.  Yes, we want your contribution but your support and your network of friends and family are valuable to push the <b>RC21</b> to market.  </p>

Ever since coming back to Canada, he has been trying to get back to Indonesia and accomplish his goal. </p><p>He wrote the following to share his story:</p><blockquote>Nicholas Alexander Lai-Cheong <br/> Born: August 15, 1989</blockquote><blockquote>When I was a kid, I found that I was pretty decent at sports. I could throw a basket ball and once in a while it would go in. In hockey, I could maneuver and steal the puck from the opposing team with little effort. In high school, I even earned the nickname ""Great Wall of China"" for my defensive skills. Though I didn't pursue these sports, I was pretty good for a kid with no training. But this high opinion of myself changed when I was 16 years old in grade 11 gym class. This was when I first picked up a badminton racket and every time I swung it; I'd pull out my shoulder, every time I took a step, I'd sprain my ankle. Never in my life have I felt more defeated by anything. So I popped my shoulder back into place and said to myself, ""No! I'm not going to let this game beat me!"" This was because I didn't want something else tell me what I can and cannot do. Because, even though you may lose to your opponent, you can only be truly defeated by yourself.</blockquote><blockquote>It's funny though, that as soon as you mention you have a goal, everybody wants to put obstacles in front of it. As soon as I started training, I was met with nay-sayers saying things like, ""You'll never beat him"" or ""You're not good enough"". But I had already made up my mind and was determined to see it through until I had this game beat. I was determined to prove to them and to myself that it's not the most talented guy who wins or the guy with the most potential that wins. It's the guy with the most perseverance that wins!</blockquote><blockquote> Even after I hit my goals and sought after higher heights, I felt like people don't learn because no matter how good I got, they still said the same thing, ""Nic, you're never going to make it"", ""it's impossible"". So I made it a mission to shut these people up once and for all. I didn't want anybody to say things like that about me ever again or about anything ever again. At this point, I changed my goal from not just becoming good at this sport but to be the greatest of all time. This way, nobody will be able to say, ""Nic can't beat this guy"" or ""He doesn't have what it takes"". When you have a strong voice in your head screams to keep going, it makes it really hard to hear the whispers of weak minds.</blockquote><blockquote>Though the goal may be the same, my views about badminton have changed since then. It's no longer about having to prove to others or myself what I'm worth, no longer searching for approval from outside sources. Now, it's about realizing my maximum potential as a human being and honestly expressing myself through badminton. ""It is like a finger pointing away to the moon. Don't concentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory."" (Bruce Lee: Enter the Dragon 1973). The ""finger"" in this case is winning, it's the fool's idea of glory. The ""heavenly glory"" is becoming better at the game day by day and becoming a better person in general. So now to me, badminton is a process of continuing growth. I plan to keep growing until I reach my ultimate goal; to be the greatest badminton player of all time.</blockquote><blockquote>How I plan on achieving this dream is to train in Indonesia for a few years straight to truly realize my maximum potential as a human being. Indonesia is well known in the badminton community as having among the strongest badminton players in history. So by training with some of their top players, I can then hone my own skills and put them to the test in local and international competitions. Come 2016, I will then be ready to put my skills on full display as I take on the champions of badminton across the world at the Rio 2016 Olympics.</blockquote><h3>What Your Donation Will Do</h3><p>Nic has the skill and potential to win. All he needs is the financial support to allow him to do what he does best. Play badminton. </p><p>So far Nic has been able to save $3000 to cover his initial flight to Indonesia and was recently sponsored by Victor Badminton. However, he is still left with costs for his training, living expenses, transportation, and each competition he plays in will need funding for hotel, entry fees, and other miscellaneous costs at an average of $1000 a tournament. Nic must win 5 to qualify for the Olympics. </p><p>Due to time constraints and in order to maximize results, Nic in 2015 will compete in the following in order to qualify for the Olympics:</p><ul>
<li><p>Malaysia Open</p></li>
<li><p>Singapore Open</p></li>
<li><p>Indonesia Open</p></li>
<li><p>U.S. or Canada Open (only one will be chosen)</p></li>

Anything over and above the desired goal will allow him to continue his training for longer.</p><p><br/></p><h3>How You Can Help</h3><p>Please donate!

What we are going to do is help raise him a minimum of $20,000 over the next 60 days to help fund his living expenses while in Indonesia, the costs for his professional training and coach, as well as the expenses for the International Tournaments.Nic's StoryNic has been playing badminton for 7 years, 5 of which were spent playing professionally.

<p><strong>Who We Are </strong><br/>Club Degree is a socially conscious group of denim designers that aim to satisfy the need to mix style with social consciousness. <br/><br/><strong>Club Degree's Inspiration </strong><br/>We embrace changes in fashion and outlook on life. What was socially unacceptable fifty years ago, like gay marriage, or even mixed marriages, is accepted as a part of life today in most places. There are times, however, when changes create conflict and some well meaning citizens are caught in the middle of a case of divided loyalty. Case in point, wearing jeans below the butt. Some well meaning kids want to keep up with the latest fashion trends but they are pulled in the other direction by others who believe that the style is obscene and degrading. What is a kid to do if he wants to fit in with his buddies but he also wants to please his parents? <br/><br/><strong>The Solution </strong><br/>Club Degree has found the best solution. Meet Club Degree Jeans. It sits on the waist but looks like it falls under the butt! Crazy? Impossible? Not for the designers at Club Degree! Check out our before and after pictures: </p>

<p>When beginning Foster we had a simple goal; to create a business that is focused from the ground up on ""doing the right thing"". Everyday people are faced with making decisions both big and small that have an affect on those around them. Businesses are faced with these decisions as well; however, the choices made by businesses tend to have a much larger impact on not only people, but also the environment. </p>
<p>Most businesses exist solely to make a profit. We have drawn inspiration from the few businesses and organizations that make an extended effort to do the right thing by focusing on fair labor standards, taking steps to be more sustainable or environmentally friendly, and donating a percentage of profit to charity. We've recognized that the next step is to build a business that can be trusted to live up to each of these and look good doing it. That is why we've created Foster.</p>
<p>Foster Apparel is brand which puts the well being of the world first in an effort to measure our success in much more than profit. We want to lead by example and prove it possible to put people and the environment first, while remaining successful as a business.

<h1>How it Works...</h1>
<p>1. Our products are manufactured in a socially responsible facility where all employees are treated fairly.</p>
<p>2. We utilize materials which are better for the environment such as organic cotton, bamboo, or hemp.</p>

<p>The next step is to put it into action. Your contribution will provide us with funds to print our summer 2012 run of tees (to be stocked in Community Bikes and sold at our online store).

We have set out all groundwork for this project. We have artwork, a screen printer, a manufacturer, and a small following of interested supporters. We've even landed a stockist in Philadelphia, PA for the summer 2012 season! (Community Bikes and Boards)

 
The next step is to put it into action. Your contribution will provide us with funds to print our summer 2012 run of tees (to be stocked in Community Bikes and sold at our online store). We believe the world needs more businesses like Foster. With your contribution we will be one step closer making that a reality.
As a perk to being a contributor, you will be able to choose your own logo and shirt color. Above are options for backer rewards tee shirts and hoodies. Items are made in the USA from 60% viscose hemp and 40% organic cotton. They will be printed simply with the FOSTER logo to help promote our brand.
 
( There are a limited number of items in certain sizes and colors. If the color or size you choose happens to be unavailable you will have the option of choosing a new color or waiting for the backorder to be shipped.)",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<div>My name is Julie Phelps and I am a Toronto-based fashion redesigner of the clothing line JOOL. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>JOOL is a collection of vintage pieces carefully reclaimed and redesigned into modern and unique works of art. Every piece is different just like each one of us. My love of fashion, the earth, and my relentless creative streak, has led me down this path to reinvent fashion intended to inspire unique personal style. Through my eyes, the JOOL customer is an eco-vintage-fashionista with a modern flare. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All JOOL pieces are sourced locally, redesigned, sewn, and distributed by me. Not only are most of my garments upcycled, a large majority of my notions/trims/thread, etc. have been donated or recycled as well. Nothing goes to waste!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After being accepted into FAT - ALTERNATIVE FASHION WEEK in Toronto, I decided to start this campaign to raise funds to support the production of my line and fees for the fashion show. This is an amazing opportunity to launch my clothing line into the fashion world and gain the exposure I need to take JOOL to the next level!</div>
<p><a href=""http://www.alternativefashionweek.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 87); text-decoration: underline;"">http://www.alternativefashionweek.com/</a><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I feel there is a growing need for environmental awareness and sustainability in many areas of life, including the fashion industry. With the popularity of vintage clothing and eco-friendly fabrics and practices, I feel JOOL has a definable place and consumer in the fashion world. The JOOL customer is looking to express individuality while also remaining eco-conscious about their clothing choices.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>JOOL proves that you can be unique, eco-gorgeous, retro and fashion forward, all at the same time!!</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<div>With the money that is funded for my campaign, it will go towards the following:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>$500 - entrance fee to show 10 outfits at FAT-Alternative Fashion Week</div>
<div>$500 - production of the 10 outfits</div>
<div>$300 - accessories</div>
<div>$200 - promotion materials: flyers, business cards, labels</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If I don't receive the full funding amount for the show, the portion that is raised will go to the entrance fee. I will still go ahead with participating in FAT even if the full funding is not raised. I am busy with freelance work and also work p/t time. The money raised on IndieGoGo will definitely help considerably to make the show an even greater success!</div>
<p> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>When Fat Shark launched its <a href=""https://www.fatshark.com/product/hdo-fpv-goggles/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HDO drone racing goggles</a> earlier this year, many pilots were excited about the new OLED technology used in the headset. Others pointed out that they missed the ultra-wide field of view available in previous generation goggles.</p>
<p>So: we're firing up the old manufacturing line one last time to bring back the industry favorite HD2: Terminator Edition.</p>
<p>The HD2 features a 50° field of view, which is the widest field of view for any micro-display goggle on the market. The only drawback to that image is that it's so big that it's difficult to get fully in focus; many pilots report seeing blurry edges at the edges of their HD2 screens.</p>
<p>The HD2, like like HD3 and all goggles before it, also uses an LCD chip as its core display technology. So while the image may be bigger, it's less crisp and colorful than the OLED display in the HDO.</p>
<p>For those that don't care about those drawbacks, the HD2, Terminator Edition (T2) may be for you.</p>
<p>Like the HD2, the T2 has an identical, 50° field of view LCD screen. But the T2 has also been updated for the modern pilot. That includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>An updated expansion bay for power-hungry modules like the Rapidfire</li>
<li>An updated DVR interface (just like the HDO) for better image capture</li>
<li>A USB-chargeable battery</li>
</ul>
<p>The T2 also features special, limited edition branding.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529530553/lpq9sv6cgadwv1itaqjy.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How is This Different From The HDO?</h3>
<p>Great question! The T2 has a wider field of view than the HDO but uses older imaging technology to create its image. In short, you'll see a slightly bigger image in the T2 that may be blurrier around the edges and that won't be as crisp and responsive as an image out of the HDO.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Each T2 goggle purchased in this campaign will be drop shipped directly to you from Hong Kong. We'll only do one production run based off of this campaign; after that, no more T2s will be built.</p>
<p>Tooling and parts have already been allocated from our suppliers. Fat Shark needs 45 days from the close of the campaign to fire up the production line, reprint packaging and sort out the shipping. After that, the T2 will once more return to obscurity.</p>
<p>All that we need from you is a minimum of 500 units ordered so we can justify the order to our factory. If retailer demand shows up, we'll also include a batch of retailer units in this production run.</p>
<p>Shipping to G7 countries is calculated at checkout but <strong>any duty and import taxes are your own responsibility</strong>. Please budget accordingly.</p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>The good news is that this isn't Fat Shark's first attempt at making drone goggles. We've got the suppliers, factory and infrastructure lined up. All that we need is market demand.</p>
<p>As with any consumer electronics product there is always a risk of delays at the factory or shipping-related challenges. But we'll do our best to deliver the product within a 45 day window of the campaign's close. And you can always reach us here, on Facebook or at support@fatshark.com to get a status update.</p>

Woodies started because standard sizing doesn't make sense like it used to. Getting perfect fitting clothes, made especially for you has never been easier and more accessible.
We recently introduced incredible 3D measuring technology that makes getting your measurements easier than ever, and now, we're excited to launch chinos!




















Not savvy with a tape measure? Our guess is probably not. To this point, getting custom clothing meant taking your own measurements (a daunting task), but fear no more!

Creating each piece individually allows for unique, one-of-a-kind styles to exude elegance and quiet sensibility that lives through generations. The art of handcrafting with leathers sourced from the finest tanneries in the world is not something that is taken lightly.Esquivel is more than a name — it is over two decades of refined finesse crafted into each product. Every piece tells the story of a commitment to artistry that allows Esquivel to always transcend fashion traditions and reinvent the aesthetic for the current wardrobe. Gorgeous lines and polished textures confidently carry clients throughout their day; Esquivel not only represents style — it represents effortless beauty and allure.  Child hunger is a cause very close to my heart, so I designed a bag to give back.It brings me joy to say each X tote is handcrafted here in Southern California, providing jobs to our community and hope to those we help feed.When you buy an X tote, you can be sure it was crafted by a team of highly qualified craftsmen. Made with hand-cut canvas and leather, each bag is produced with utmost care, stitched with an experienced, keen eye, and delivered with a promise of satisfaction.The process is simple: every bag bought will be a hungry family helped. You can proudly carry your tote knowing you've crossed out a year's worth of hungry weekends for a grateful family.And thanks to the bag's signature Esquivel ""X"", everyone else will know it, too.Read more about the logistics for helping hungry families in the ""Giving Children Hope: Doing Our Part"" section. George Esquivel is a designer and craftsman based in Southern California, but his designs can be seen in worldwide boutiques — as well as on notable celebrities clients, such as Emma Stone, LeBron James, Madonna, Gwen Stefani, Elon Musk and Brad Pitt.Primarily a shoemaker, George has satisfied personal clients and select retailers for over two decades, proof of which can be seen in Vogue, Forbes, Haute Living, and The Los Angeles Times.George weaves his passion for quality and durability into every piece of his work — and each piece tells its own, unique story.George operates out of an atelier in Orange County, California, working with the finest tanneries in the world and producing limited amounts of all of his designs to ensure quality.As a very hands-on kind of guy, he couldn't be more excited to be a part of the process of developing your personal X Tote. George was raised primarily in poverty. His mother worked as a cleaning lady and took many odd jobs to support him and his 4 siblings while his father was unreliable, in and out of jail, dealing drugs, and addicted to drugs. To put it simply, food was scarce; his mother would sometimes take food donations from people who hired her, but the quality of this charity was often subpar — and if George's father were to come home high, he was known to scourge what little food there was for his own, selfish benefit.With the basic human necessity of food not always a certainty, George remembers feeling bitter and resentful towards people just because they were eating. After spending his entire childhood watching his mother struggle to feed him, he is now determined to relieve stress from low-income families currently experiencing the same kind of daily pain. In his own words: “I’ve been blessed enough now. It’s my duty to give back.” Giving Children Hope is a local California organization dedicated to serving vulnerable children and families. GCH also helps around the world and recently sent 80,242 pounds of relief supplies for Hurricane Harvey, 34,919 pounds of relief supplies for Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and 38,446 pounds of relief supplies to Mexico after the earthquake. GCH has a perfect four-star rating on Charity Navigator. As a former homeless child, George is thrilled to partner with GCH’s “We’ve Got Your Back” program, which donates backpacks full of food to homeless kids in Orange County. Each child in the “We’ve Got Your Back” program is given enough food to last 3-4 family members through the weekend, when the children do not have access to free and reduced lunches at school. The program has been active and successfully feeding over 4,000 individuals for 10 years.Each X Tote sale will mean 56 of these backpacks full of food; in other words, each tote is over a year’s worth of weekend meals for a needy family.These 56 weekends of food can happen thanks to a 10% donation from each X Tote sale. It's George's sole mission to make sure everything from his workshop is built to his top-shelf standard, and because each X Tote will be crafted with the same care and excellence as any other haute Esquivel product, the same overhead and production costs will apply.So, as of now, each X Tote is helping ONE family for a year. But, with your help, we can donate even more! More X Tote sales means more of a percentage to charity, as seen below. After all, 56 weeks is a good amount of food – but we can always do better, together. Your gift gets doubled - the X Tote is the gift that gives back to people in need. It's the perfect gift for the holidays!

<h2><b>FAQs</b></h2>
<div><b>Q: Where can I download the app?</b></div>
<p>Once we launch the app, which will be in the next few months, you will be able to download the app from the iTunes Store or Android Marketplace.</p>
<div><b>Q: Where does the 1% donation come from?</b></div>
<p>The 1% donation from each purchase that you make using Cause Mobile Wallet comes from the merchant service fee. Each time a merchant processes a payment made with a credit or debit card, that merchant is charged a percentage of the transaction amount for the service of verifying and processing the transaction. Cause Mobile Wallet has eliminated several steps and “middle-men” within this process which enables us to charge merchants a similar amount to what they are normally paying to process a credit or debit card and give 1% of the transaction amount to the charity or school of your choice.</p>
<div><b>Q: Where does the 1% donation go?</b></div>
<p>100% of the donations made using Cause Mobile Wallet go to whichever charity or school that YOU choose from our list. It is that simple! </p>
<div><b>Q: Do I get to keep my credit card airline miles and bonus points?</b></div>
<p>Yes! You will accumulate and keep your airline miles and bonus points just as you would if you had used your regular credit or debit card (providing that your credit or debit card has those rewards.). The difference is that with Cause Mobile Wallet, in addition to keeping your miles and points, 1% of the transaction amount is donated to the charity or school of your choice! It's a WIN WIN!</p>
<div><b>Q: Is it safe to use?</b></div>
<p>Yes. Your credit/debit information is stored securely with your unique, personal PIN. If your phone is ever lost or stolen no one will be able to access your Cause Mobile Wallet information or be able to make a purchase without your code. We use a secure payment method that utilizes highest security standards as required by the card processing industry.  For more information regarding card security standards, please visit <a href=""https://west.exch031.serverdata.net/owa/redir.aspx?C=xTDBw3kEi0qqwYGcJglHoY4JJdk2mtAIPeOC11k2dz1u6udJ1Vx2sVSW4BVcOL005NX2-H8ZZak.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.pcisecuritystandards.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pcisecuritystandards.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a merchant, then yes, you will be able to claim the transaction fee as a write-off just as you normally do with all credit and debit card transactions.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: <b>Does Cause Mobile Wallet work with school fundraising programs like ""scrip?""</b></p>

<p>A few years ago, on a trip to India with our daughters, we saw the reality
of being born a girl in India and the unique challenges that faced these young
girls from the moment they are conceived and at every moment of their
existence. The difference between the comforts and opportunities our daughters
had and the lack thereof for these girls was staggering. In the land of karma,
these differences could be simply written off as “it must be their karma” but
we felt it was our karma to be there at that moment, to witness the life unfold
and to realize that karma is to right a wrong, not to merely observe it. We
were determined to do something about what we had witnessed and to make a
difference by helping girls like the ones we met that day.</p>

Since then, we have had many experiences in the efforts to
help. We have collected funds for a school for tribal kids in India so they
could purchase school supplies and toys. We also supported a private orphanage
in Madras which has adopted “unwanted girls,” often with special needs. <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: 13.5pt;""><font color=""#000000""> </font></span></p><p></p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: 13.5pt;""><font color=""#000000""></font></span></p><p><font color=""#000000""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/450149/files/20140321113157-tribalschool1.jpg?1395426717"" src="""" style=""""/></font></p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: 13.5pt;""><font color=""#000000""></font></span></p><p>But we wanted to do more and we wanted to promote the kind of
thinking that encourages us to be “bigger” than we think we are.</p>
<p>We created the brand, mustbkarma with that in mind. The first
illustrations – “Love”, “Care”, “Connect”, “Peace” and “Transcend” – <b>were
designed by our daughters, Anita, at age 9, and Leena, at age 12.</b></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: 13.5pt;""><font color=""#000000""><b></b></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; font-size: 13.5pt;""><font color=""#000000""></font></span></p><p><font color=""#000000""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/450150/files/20140321113310-girls_pic.JPG?1395426790"" src="""" style=""width: 308px; height: 371px;""/></font></p><font color=""#000000""></font><p>We decided to start our product line by
creating t-shirts with unique designs and positive messages that show you can
look at life optimistically while making a difference.</p>
<p>We wanted to create a brand that would promote building good karma
through good deeds: “opportunities for doing good are limitless” was our new
mantra. And we wanted to use a part of our sales to help more girls around
the globe. For that reason we chose <i>She’s the First</i> as our
partner in making a difference (<a href=""http://www.shesthefirst.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.shesthefirst.org</span></a>), pledging 40% of our profits.</p>
<p>We hope that through education and support our brand can help
in raising generations of wise, independent and strong women.</p>
<p>With many projects in the works we are excited about mustbkarma’s
future. We hope you join us in our mission to inspire and encourage through our
brand.</p>

We have printed the first 9 designs, made many marketing efforts and are
getting a lot of positive feedback. But, of course, as a new business we need

<p>Our t-shirts are currently 100% cotton, higher quality and flattering. We plan to expand to blends to tailor to the exercise crowd.</p><p>All processes are in place: from design to fulfillment. We are a
small operation right now but we have prepared and planned for the future when
we have a large order volume. </p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>We have a
number of excited artists who love to work with us and bring our designs to
life</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>We have a
great local reliable printer that doesn’t just print our t-shirts but is
involved in almost every other process </p>
<p>3.<span> 
</span>We
fulfill our orders ourselves right now but have a fulfillment center lined up
for the future </p>

</span>Btw, we
print our own labels on these t-shirts – so it’s OUR brand all the way!</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>So far, we've had to print minimum
quantities which means our profits from sales have been minimal, if
any. We need funds to print more than just minimum quantities in order to
place our t-shirts with yoga boutiques and schools, gyms and at
festivals. </p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>

<p>We have donated t-shirts to events and
charities, hence taking a loss on those. We will need to reprint those items.

mustbkarma is a brand devoted to promoting a positive lifestyle
through our merchandise. Our motto is “Think good thoughts. Do good deeds.”
When purchasing from mustbkarma you will not only get a fun and unique branded
product but support our humanitarian efforts. We dedicate 40% of our profits to
She's the First.
We are trying to raise money to print more branded designs on
t-shirts as well as expand our product offering plus aid our marketing and
distribution efforts to grow our brand.
We have big dreams to put our brand on the retail map as well as
do our part in making the world a better place.WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT? We are a private label with a trademark on our logo. We want to make people pause and reflect as they see our designs: to remember to CHOOSE to be positive. We stand behind a great cause and have dreams of doing much more as we grow.OUR STORY
A few years ago, on a trip to India with our daughters, we saw the reality
of being born a girl in India and the unique challenges that faced these young
girls from the moment they are conceived and at every moment of their
existence. The difference between the comforts and opportunities our daughters
had and the lack thereof for these girls was staggering. In the land of karma,
these differences could be simply written off as “it must be their karma” but
we felt it was our karma to be there at that moment, to witness the life unfold
and to realize that karma is to right a wrong, not to merely observe it. We
were determined to do something about what we had witnessed and to make a
difference by helping girls like the ones we met that day.

Since then, we have had many experiences in the efforts to
help. We have collected funds for a school for tribal kids in India so they
could purchase school supplies and toys. We also supported a private orphanage
in Madras which has adopted “unwanted girls,” often with special needs.  But we wanted to do more and we wanted to promote the kind of
thinking that encourages us to be “bigger” than we think we are.
We created the brand, mustbkarma with that in mind. The first
illustrations – “Love”, “Care”, “Connect”, “Peace” and “Transcend” – were
designed by our daughters, Anita, at age 9, and Leena, at age 12.We decided to start our product line by
creating t-shirts with unique designs and positive messages that show you can
look at life optimistically while making a difference.
We wanted to create a brand that would promote building good karma
through good deeds: “opportunities for doing good are limitless” was our new
mantra. And we wanted to use a part of our sales to help more girls around
the globe. For that reason we chose She’s the First as our
partner in making a difference (www.shesthefirst.org), pledging 40% of our profits.
We hope that through education and support our brand can help
in raising generations of wise, independent and strong women.
With many projects in the works we are excited about mustbkarma’s
future. We hope you join us in our mission to inspire and encourage through our
brand.

We have printed the first 9 designs, made many marketing efforts and are
getting a lot of positive feedback. But, of course, as a new business we need
funding to print many more of our designs, expand into sweatshirts, fun yoga
clothes, pets’ apparel, and accessories. Everything is set up and running
smoothly: we come up with ideas which are drawn by professional artists and
then printed – all we need is your help!We hope to share some good karma!
WHAT WE HAVE
Our t-shirts are currently 100% cotton, higher quality and flattering. We plan to expand to blends to tailor to the exercise crowd.All processes are in place: from design to fulfillment. We are a
small operation right now but we have prepared and planned for the future when
we have a large order volume. 
1. 
We have a
number of excited artists who love to work with us and bring our designs to
life
2. 
We have a
great local reliable printer that doesn’t just print our t-shirts but is
involved in almost every other process 
3. 
We
fulfill our orders ourselves right now but have a fulfillment center lined up
for the future 
4. 
Btw, we
print our own labels on these t-shirts – so it’s OUR brand all the way!
WHAT WE NEED
So far, we've had to print minimum
quantities which means our profits from sales have been minimal, if
any. We need funds to print more than just minimum quantities in order to
place our t-shirts with yoga boutiques and schools, gyms and at
festivals.  


We don't have much of a marketing
budget but realize marketing is the key to success. Marketing is
expensive. To gain more exposure, we need to advertise and attend the more
expensive events such as the Yoga Journal conferences which
alone can cost as much as $1000 to be a vendor.
We have donated t-shirts to events and
charities, hence taking a loss on those. We will need to reprint those items.
 
We have been asked to produce exercise-friendly
t-shirts made from special exercise-friendly fabrics which are more expensive,
hence require a bigger budget.We need funds to expand our product selection to totes, yoga mats and accessories,
yoga pants, gym towels and duffels bags and more.We have 3 designs waiting to be printed: Evolution (highly
anticipated),Ascend and one without a message which is a
surprise – it’ll be out first design with a dog on it and it’ll speak to “living in the
moment”.

Last but certainly not
least, we want to expand our pet line to include different designs and sizes.
Jackson (below) would like all his friends to wear one of our t-shirts.
THE IMPACT
We estimate that about 3K will allow us to print the 3 new designs on
t-shirts and a few accessories such as totes and yoga mats.Once the designs are printed we will place them with yoga studios,
boutiques and fitness gyms as well as continue our online distribution and festival attendence.
Anything over the goal will be used for a more intense advertising, PR and marketing effort.
If we do extremely well and go far beyond the goal, we can apply
the extra money to expand our product line even further and bring to life the
many other designs still waiting in the pipeline.When you contribute $35, $50 or $100 you will be receiving our t-shirts to enjoy, wear and spread the good energy!
Your contribution will not only support our brand but partake in a
bigger idea behind our product: promoting positive thinking and helping others
in need.
The next designs, particularly Evolution, have been highly
anticipated by our customers and fans, so it will be your money that will
finally bring this design to life and propel our company into the new dimension
of future growth and success.

<p>A note from Nary.... <br/>Thank you for your interest in my Campaign!</p>
<p>I have been on my creative journey since I was a homeless teenager at 14. My focus on design has been the light that has led me away from a troubled childhood, to New York and driven me to stay on course despite tremendous personal and professional challenges.</p>
<p>This re-launch of my brand has allowed me to personally focus on what and who I am as a designer. I am focusing more on my Laotian heritage and modernizing the sensuality of the culture and tastefully balancing elements for the confident, modern woman for whom I design. The design and development for NARY MANIVONG takes place in New York City, employing skilled sample and pattern makers in New York's Garment Center.</p>
<p>I still keep a note that I wrote during my darkest imes on the street with me ""Nary, You could do it, Believe"" with me at all times and it inspires me to move forward. My story was documented in the film ""Dressed"" and I am grateful that others could hear my story and so moved by the support. (Dressed-themovie.com)</p>
<p>Risks and Challenges: I have been in the fashion industry for 14 years, seeing the highs, lows, non-stop challenges and have used these experiences to learn, strengthen my focus and expertise of my craft and business acumen. The monies requested are to be used for fabrics, thread, trims, models, garment sample costs, pattern making, filming, equipment and lighting rental, producing the collection in a NYC factory, rent, transportation and support staffing create create my Fall/Winter 2013 debut collection. Take a look in the gallery to see my designs and a look into my life.</p>

<h3>Single-use plastic gloves destroy our planet</h3>

About ViralOff®️ self-cleaning treatment
An innovative technology that reduces the need to wash the gloves.
The latest treatment technology from the Swedish company Polygiene®. Applied to textiles, including face masks, ViralOff® has been certified by ISO 18184:2019 and ATCC VR-1679 (H3N2) tests. The active ingredient is a biocide, based on the reaction mass of titanium dioxide and silver chloride.
After every use just put the är Gloves in the bag and they will self-clean in 2 hours.

 
About Eco Acqua Zero™
A cutting-edge fabric treatment that lets you enjoy your daily life comfortably.
Eco Acqua Zero™ is a fluorine-free water repellent technology. Based on special hyper-branched polymers, this hydrophobic environmentally-friendly & PFOA-free textile treatment provides a water-repellent performance with low impact on breathability. It also helps remove moisture from inside the gloves, transporting it to the surface where it can evaporate.

 
Touchscreen friendly
Use your phone or tablet like you always do.
är Gloves are touchscreen-friendly, so you can browse Instagram, answer emails or share your favorite photos as usual. In public transport, airports or restaurants.

 
Be Safe. Be Stylish. Be Comfortable.

är Gloves are the ideal partner for every occasion in our daily urban lives. We designed är Gloves for ourselves, for our need to have stylish accessories which will protect us every step of the way.Now it's time to share them with YOU.
 
är Gloves are designed for everyday use
In public transport
In public transport, you are touching surfaces which were touched by thousands of people before you. 


 
For withdrawing money from ATMs
Even in the digital age, sometimes we need to withdraw cash from ATMs. Most ATMs aren't cleaned daily. You never know who withdrew money before you.

 
For quick commuting on share-scooters
E-scooters became a part of transportation in every big city around the globe. They are charged every day, but they aren't always cleaned.

 
är Gloves are design with cars in mind
Cars are part of our every day lives, from a quick taxi ride to the airport to grabbing a parking ticket.


 
For Shopping
Do you need a quick snack or a big trip to the mall? är Gloves has you covered.

 
Single-use plastic gloves destroy our planet
75% of plastic gloves will end up in landfills, or floating in the seas. Using the är Gloves helps you protect yourself and also helps protect the environment.
“Plastic pollution was already one of the greatest threats to our planet before the coronavirus outbreak,” says Pamela Coke-Hamilton, UNCTAD’s director of international trade. “The sudden boom in the daily use of certain products to keep people safe and stop the disease is making things much worse.”

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, welcome to my very first crowdfunding campaign! This is so exciting. </p>
<p>I am Marianne ""Mau"" Simmelkiær, a Danish designer based in the <strong>Greater Copenhagen Area of Denmark</strong>. I have been part of the fashion industry for 25 years, <i>for good and for bad</i>. </p>
<p>As a designer, I have seen first-hand how the diversity of fashion expressions has skyrocketed over the years, only to lower the overall quality of the fashion industry, put pressure on the production facilities, confuse the end user and explosively increase the amount of waste we leave in landfills.</p>
<p>As one who has contributed to this massive style-inferno in my early days as a designer, I now feel obligated to suggest an alternative. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>An alternative to <i>""fast forward fashion""</i>.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>My mission</h3>
<p>The alternative I offer is the <strong>EnCourage Philosophy</strong>, revolving around the EnCourage Suit supported by a small range of longlasting EnCourage products. The design must be <strong>timeless</strong> and the <strong>quality</strong> high, the products must be <strong>functional</strong> and make you<strong> feel strong</strong>, beautiful and comfortable at the same time. The EnCourage products are designed to ease your everyday life, to help you minimalize your wardrobe and <strong>encourage you to live a simpler life</strong>. </p>
<p>I've decided to put first things first and try to leave a small, but important footstep in the history of Fashion. Will you join me on my mission? <strong>The more we join, the stronger a movement</strong> and a bigger, more remarkable footstep we will leave!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The product: The EnCourage Suit</h2>
<p>The EnCourage Suit is a one-piece suit that balances aesthetics, quality, functionality and comfort in an elegant and innovative way. It will kickstart your <strong>feeling of freedom from the accelerating fashion cycles</strong> – and get you out of the door faster. </p>
<p><strong>The suit is versatile </strong>and perfect to wear for work, cocktail parties, morning meditation sessions, picking up the kids <i>and</i> playing with them afterwards. Also suitable for grocery shopping or enojying a quiet espresso, all alone in the sofa. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Design composition </strong></h3>
<p>The design composition of the EnCourage Suit ranges from a classic tailored jacket that frames your face beautifully, to futuristic, functional solutions such as a stretchable zipper and the basic comfort of a natural, breathable fabric. <br/><br/>Its straight shoulders are underlined as in classic tailoring to create <strong>a balanced silhouette</strong>. The sleeves have tailor tricks embedded, which make the upper arm appear slimmer, and cupping the top sleeve close to the shoulder also adds to a well-balanced silhouette. The sleeves are slightly (approximately 3 cm)<strong> longer than standard sleeves</strong>.<br/><br/>The suit has a <strong>stretchable zipper around the waistline </strong>for a practical opening – or for dividing the suit into two separate items. <i>One EnCourage Suit makes three different wearables!</i> With EnCourage, restroom visits while wearing a one-piece will never again cause a panic attack. <br/><br/>The Encourage Suit is constructed to let you <strong>walk, bend and sit freely</strong>. The waistline is low, offering flexibility in torso-length when sitting and is adjustable in circumference by the stretchy fabric. You'll be surprised how well it fits different body shapes!</p>
<p>The waistline can be tightened with a<strong> flat lace trim </strong>connected at centre front. The body of the suit is slim-looking, but with ease, to keep it feeling comfortable in use.</p>
<p>Pantlegs are kept in straight lines for elegance. They have a <strong>visual slimming effect </strong>with comfortable (stretchy) slimness at the hip, grading into a slightly wider bottom hem. The EnCourage Suit has 4,5 cms of<strong> adjustable length</strong> at the bottom and has a unique <i>""galoche detail""</i>, so you can look beautiful in both high heels and sneakers, just by using a simple snap button technique. The pants have stitched press folds to remain elegant, through daily use.</p>
<p>Five functional and elegantly integrated pockets on front hip, chest and wrist mean you <strong>always have your most needed items close by</strong>. <i>Just leave your handbag behind when leaving the office to get your caffeine fix!</i> Your phone and keys are kept safe, locked in by a quality zipper on your lower front. Hip pockets keep your small and random pickup items handy (and your hands warm on cold days). And last, but not least: Your credit card and subway ticket are safely located on your wrist - always conveniently at hand! Literally. </p>
<p>Also by hand, but tone-in-tone, small and beautifully hidden, I have placed a small Chinese sign of the Sisterhood you join, by acquiring a suit. <strong>Only those in the know</strong> will know of the little detail, that has great importance to me and hopefully soon to you too.<br/><br/>The one-piece construction of the EnCourage Suit is made from an exclusive merino wool fibre – ensuring an <strong>overall comfortable temperature</strong> by balancing heat and cold vertically.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Colour</strong></h3>
<p>The EnCourage Suit will be launched in a <strong>sophisticated charcoal grey</strong> - that compliments all skin tones and creates an elegant contrast to all hair colours - and in a limited early bird edition of <strong>black</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>100% Merino Wool</strong></h3>
<p>The suit is made of <strong>100% Merino</strong>, the world's finest wool fibre.<br/><br/>Wool is a natural fibre obtained from sheep and has many wonderful benefits: Thanks to this fibre, the EnCourage Suit has <strong>antibacterial and antimicrobial</strong> features and is both <strong>static and wrinkle resistant.</strong></p>
<p>It is <strong>dirt repellant, flexible, breathable, soft, durable</strong> and has a great ability to regulate body temperature – it even keeps you warm when wet! It absorbs odours, too, so forgetting your deodorant at home is no longer a catastrophe. </p>
<p>Simply put, merino wool is comfortable to wear and <strong>easy to care for</strong>.</p>

</div><div>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>I'm asking for €50.000 to start up EnCourage as<strong> a sustainable business</strong>.</p>
<p>The fashion value chain traditionally requires a much larger sum to kickstart, as the minimum quantities in the production of garments are high and reserved for established companies only.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>Why crowdfunding?</strong> </h3>
<p>There are several reasons I have chosen to rely on crowdfunding, but basically, it is because I think that this is where my project belongs.</p>
<p>I identify with the strong positive values I believe belongs to the crowdfunding concept and my design philosophy is based on values which do <i>not</i> include a massive turnover - hence the concept is not attractive to banks nor business angels. And even <i>if</i> offered a loan, my mission would still be to spend funds on fibres and craft - not on mortgage and marketing plans.</p>
<p>In short: I want to share the process of making user-friendly clothing and I am carefully avoiding the usual process of the fashion industry - I wish to see where crowd-forces may lead the outcome! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Budget breakdown</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>€16.000 <strong>Production</strong> of 200 EnCourage Suits - the very first batch</li>
<li>~ €9.050: <strong>Worldwide shipping </strong>of suits and perks with carrier (~ estimate)</li>
<li>€8.500: <strong>Perks</strong> - development, samples, production</li>
<li>€6.700: 450 extra meters of <strong>100% best quality Merino Wool</strong> for perks (= future EnCourage wearables)</li>
<li>~ €4.000 <strong>Indiegogo and banking costs</strong> (if I reach my goal of €50.000 ~ costs are proportional to income)</li>
<li>€3.600: <strong>Packaging</strong> - design, development and production</li>
<li>€950: <strong>Webshop, -server, -host, online advertising</strong> (1 year)</li>
</ul> <p><u><strong>= Total of ~ €48.800</strong></u></p> <p>… which leaves €1.200 for unexpected extra expenses</p> <p><strong>Any extra income above €50.000</strong> will be spent on 2nd batch EnCourage Suit production and development of future EnCourage wearables.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What you get</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>membership of the <strong>EnCourage Sisterhood</strong> community</li>
<li>the possibility of getting first access to high-end high-quality products at an <strong>exclusive first mover price</strong>
</li>
<li>lovely and <strong>functional perks</strong> for you to enjoy!</li>
<li><strong>free worldwide shipping</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>transparency</strong> in business and production process</li>
<li>personal and kind contact and customer support by me personally - <strong>I want you to be happy!</strong>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>I want to empower women and take clothing to a new level. My passion is clear, but I can’t fulfil my mission completely on my own. I wish to collaborate with <i>you</i> - and hopefully, make a strengthening EnCourage Sistership community arise across the Globe. This, simply because <strong>I believe that teamwork makes a better world</strong>.  </p>
<p>Crowds can do magnificent things together. I want to open up the process of making user-friendly clothes through a shared<i> </i>anti-fashion-production. A successful, crowdsourced user-loving (anti-)fashion-object might just<strong> inspire the industry to re-think current practice</strong>!</p> <h3>The EnCourage vision</h3>
<p><strong>We want fewer products - but of higher quality - on the market in the future.</strong></p>
<p>We want to<strong> take pressure off the production facilities </strong>- without lowering their end income. We want to minimize the amount of fully functional garments, that are left as waste in landfills.</p>
<p>We want to <strong>make Fashion less confusing for the consumer</strong>, by raising the overall quality of the fashion industry, slowing down the fashion cycle and remove reasons of bad conscience associated with clothing.</p>
<p><strong>We want to promote <i>smart living, simple living</i></strong>. “Looking good” shall no longer take up energy that is better spent on life empowering activities.<br/><br/> </p>
<h2>Possible challenges </h2>
<p>There are some limitations that could prevent the suit from creating the desired effect on a universal level:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Suit and the message</h3>
<p><strong>The design of the EnCourage Suit is versatile, but not <i>universal</i>.</strong></p>
<p>It is designed from a western (resourceful) perspective - and with the western feminine beauty ideals in mind -  to simplify life, and in most cases, it will only be able to solve this task for individuals living in this (or a similar) environment, that many perceive as <i>stressful</i>. The EnCourage message must, therefore, be understood from <strong>a western perspective</strong>. </p>
<p>The material and proportions also limit its universality: It <i>does</i> have temperature regulating properties, yes, but a merino-onesie will still not be suitable to wear in areas with a very warm climate. It will not cool you down and not necessarily simplify your life, if you live in the Philippines or Kenya (unless you work in very A/C cooled offices, of course).</p>
<p>However, I and the EnCourage Sisterhood promise to <strong>invite designers elsewhere on this planet to cover their longitude with smart and long-lasting, sustainable designs</strong>.</p>
<p>Share our design manifesto and vision to help us do so!</p> <h3>Production &amp; delivery risks</h3>
<p>Since the suit is only one small step away from mass production (200 pieces <i>is</i> a mass, although a very small one in a fashion context, right?), we are luckily over many of the major risks that may arise in a design process.</p>
<p>Since I haven’t held the final production sample in my hand yet <i>(I will update you and show you images as soon as I do!)</i> there’s still a tiny risk, that the production could be delayed. I do, however, feel confident that we will follow the production plan and <strong>start the production on time.</strong></p>
<p>A production contract is already signed and I will push the ‘produce’-button no matter what. This Indiegogo campaign is therefore set with <i>‘flexible goal’</i> and <strong>you will receive your order, no matter how close to the crowdfunding goal you take me</strong>.</p>
<p>As all products and most perks require <strong>shipping</strong>, there is a <i>small</i> risk that they will not be delivered on time. To this is added, that they are expected shipped around Christmas, our professional carriers’ busiest time of the year. I will, therefore, <strong>put an extra effort to prepare everything</strong> possible for shipping, while I wait for orders and suits to arrive from the production house.</p>
<p>I will keep you updated: You, our followers and crowd are our <i>kings</i> and <i>queens</i> and my mission is to keep the process transparent.</p>
<p>You show trust in me when helping me fund the EnCourage project and I promise:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>I trust in you and your power, and I will do the absolute best I can to meet your expectations and deliver the best product. On time.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Your contribution</h2>
<p>With your contribution, we can change fashion life for those interested and <strong>start a movement</strong>, created by the <i>EnCourage Sisterhood </i>community, towards a world with more alternatives to fast forward fashion.</p>
<p>Worldwide changes might not happen overnight, but I hope that we with our honest effort can make a difference by reaching each other and others, who want to do fashion differently. And by, hopefully, <strong>encouraging other designers to create more garments that are based on sustainable aesthetics and actual user needs</strong> - not on short-lived fashion tendencies and quick income opportunities.</p>
<p>Let’s do our best to leave a noticeable footstep in the history of Fashion.</p>
<p><strong>No contribution is too small </strong>(nor too big;)): From €1 to €50.000, <i>all</i> sizes of contributions are regarded as kind gestures towards making Fashion a different game!</p>

What would you do if you could get perfectly equipped and dressed in 30 seconds every day? Meditate? Learn French? Or just sleep in?
 

 
The product: The EnCourage Suit
The EnCourage Suit is a one-piece suit that balances aesthetics, quality, functionality and comfort in an elegant and innovative way. It will kickstart your feeling of freedom from the accelerating fashion cycles – and get you out of the door faster. 
The suit is versatile and perfect to wear for work, cocktail parties, morning meditation sessions, picking up the kids and playing with them afterwards. Also suitable for grocery shopping or enojying a quiet espresso, all alone in the sofa. 
 
Design composition 
The design composition of the EnCourage Suit ranges from a classic tailored jacket that frames your face beautifully, to futuristic, functional solutions such as a stretchable zipper and the basic comfort of a natural, breathable fabric. Its straight shoulders are underlined as in classic tailoring to create a balanced silhouette. The sleeves have tailor tricks embedded, which make the upper arm appear slimmer, and cupping the top sleeve close to the shoulder also adds to a well-balanced silhouette. The sleeves are slightly (approximately 3 cm) longer than standard sleeves.The suit has a stretchable zipper around the waistline for a practical opening – or for dividing the suit into two separate items. One EnCourage Suit makes three different wearables! With EnCourage, restroom visits while wearing a one-piece will never again cause a panic attack. The Encourage Suit is constructed to let you walk, bend and sit freely. The waistline is low, offering flexibility in torso-length when sitting and is adjustable in circumference by the stretchy fabric. You'll be surprised how well it fits different body shapes!
The waistline can be tightened with a flat lace trim connected at centre front. The body of the suit is slim-looking, but with ease, to keep it feeling comfortable in use.
Pantlegs are kept in straight lines for elegance. They have a visual slimming effect with comfortable (stretchy) slimness at the hip, grading into a slightly wider bottom hem. The EnCourage Suit has 4,5 cms of adjustable length at the bottom and has a unique ""galoche detail"", so you can look beautiful in both high heels and sneakers, just by using a simple snap button technique. The pants have stitched press folds to remain elegant, through daily use.
Five functional and elegantly integrated pockets on front hip, chest and wrist mean you always have your most needed items close by. Just leave your handbag behind when leaving the office to get your caffeine fix! Your phone and keys are kept safe, locked in by a quality zipper on your lower front. Hip pockets keep your small and random pickup items handy (and your hands warm on cold days). And last, but not least: Your credit card and subway ticket are safely located on your wrist - always conveniently at hand! Literally. 
Also by hand, but tone-in-tone, small and beautifully hidden, I have placed a small Chinese sign of the Sisterhood you join, by acquiring a suit. Only those in the know will know of the little detail, that has great importance to me and hopefully soon to you too.The one-piece construction of the EnCourage Suit is made from an exclusive merino wool fibre – ensuring an overall comfortable temperature by balancing heat and cold vertically.
 
Colour
The EnCourage Suit will be launched in a sophisticated charcoal grey - that compliments all skin tones and creates an elegant contrast to all hair colours - and in a limited early bird edition of black.
 
100% Merino Wool
The suit is made of 100% Merino, the world's finest wool fibre.Wool is a natural fibre obtained from sheep and has many wonderful benefits: Thanks to this fibre, the EnCourage Suit has antibacterial and antimicrobial features and is both static and wrinkle resistant.
It is dirt repellant, flexible, breathable, soft, durable and has a great ability to regulate body temperature – it even keeps you warm when wet! It absorbs odours, too, so forgetting your deodorant at home is no longer a catastrophe. 
Simply put, merino wool is comfortable to wear and easy to care for.

What I Need & What You Get
I'm asking for €50.000 to start up EnCourage as a sustainable business.
The fashion value chain traditionally requires a much larger sum to kickstart, as the minimum quantities in the production of garments are high and reserved for established companies only.
 

Why crowdfunding? 
There are several reasons I have chosen to rely on crowdfunding, but basically, it is because I think that this is where my project belongs.
I identify with the strong positive values I believe belongs to the crowdfunding concept and my design philosophy is based on values which do not include a massive turnover - hence the concept is not attractive to banks nor business angels. And even if offered a loan, my mission would still be to spend funds on fibres and craft - not on mortgage and marketing plans.
In short: I want to share the process of making user-friendly clothing and I am carefully avoiding the usual process of the fashion industry - I wish to see where crowd-forces may lead the outcome! 
 
Budget breakdown

€16.000 Production of 200 EnCourage Suits - the very first batch
~ €9.050: Worldwide shipping of suits and perks with carrier (~ estimate)
€8.500: Perks - development, samples, production
€6.700: 450 extra meters of 100% best quality Merino Wool for perks (= future EnCourage wearables)
~ €4.000 Indiegogo and banking costs (if I reach my goal of €50.000 ~ costs are proportional to income)
€3.600: Packaging - design, development and production
€950: Webshop, -server, -host, online advertising (1 year)
 = Total of ~ €48.800 … which leaves €1.200 for unexpected extra expenses Any extra income above €50.000 will be spent on 2nd batch EnCourage Suit production and development of future EnCourage wearables.
 
What you get

membership of the EnCourage Sisterhood community
the possibility of getting first access to high-end high-quality products at an exclusive first mover price

lovely and functional perks for you to enjoy!
free worldwide shipping

transparency in business and production process
personal and kind contact and customer support by me personally - I want you to be happy!


 

 
The Impact
I want to empower women and take clothing to a new level. My passion is clear, but I can’t fulfil my mission completely on my own. I wish to collaborate with you - and hopefully, make a strengthening EnCourage Sistership community arise across the Globe. This, simply because I believe that teamwork makes a better world.  
Crowds can do magnificent things together. I want to open up the process of making user-friendly clothes through a shared anti-fashion-production. A successful, crowdsourced user-loving (anti-)fashion-object might just inspire the industry to re-think current practice! The EnCourage vision
We want fewer products - but of higher quality - on the market in the future.
We want to take pressure off the production facilities - without lowering their end income. We want to minimize the amount of fully functional garments, that are left as waste in landfills.
We want to make Fashion less confusing for the consumer, by raising the overall quality of the fashion industry, slowing down the fashion cycle and remove reasons of bad conscience associated with clothing.
We want to promote smart living, simple living. “Looking good” shall no longer take up energy that is better spent on life empowering activities. 
Possible challenges 
There are some limitations that could prevent the suit from creating the desired effect on a universal level:
 
The Suit and the message
The design of the EnCourage Suit is versatile, but not universal.
It is designed from a western (resourceful) perspective - and with the western feminine beauty ideals in mind -  to simplify life, and in most cases, it will only be able to solve this task for individuals living in this (or a similar) environment, that many perceive as stressful. The EnCourage message must, therefore, be understood from a western perspective. 
The material and proportions also limit its universality: It does have temperature regulating properties, yes, but a merino-onesie will still not be suitable to wear in areas with a very warm climate. It will not cool you down and not necessarily simplify your life, if you live in the Philippines or Kenya (unless you work in very A/C cooled offices, of course).
However, I and the EnCourage Sisterhood promise to invite designers elsewhere on this planet to cover their longitude with smart and long-lasting, sustainable designs.
Share our design manifesto and vision to help us do so! Production & delivery risks
Since the suit is only one small step away from mass production (200 pieces is a mass, although a very small one in a fashion context, right?), we are luckily over many of the major risks that may arise in a design process.
Since I haven’t held the final production sample in my hand yet (I will update you and show you images as soon as I do!) there’s still a tiny risk, that the production could be delayed. I do, however, feel confident that we will follow the production plan and start the production on time.
A production contract is already signed and I will push the ‘produce’-button no matter what. This Indiegogo campaign is therefore set with ‘flexible goal’ and you will receive your order, no matter how close to the crowdfunding goal you take me.
As all products and most perks require shipping, there is a small risk that they will not be delivered on time. To this is added, that they are expected shipped around Christmas, our professional carriers’ busiest time of the year. I will, therefore, put an extra effort to prepare everything possible for shipping, while I wait for orders and suits to arrive from the production house.
I will keep you updated: You, our followers and crowd are our kings and queens and my mission is to keep the process transparent.
You show trust in me when helping me fund the EnCourage project and I promise: 
I trust in you and your power, and I will do the absolute best I can to meet your expectations and deliver the best product. On time.
 

 
Your contribution
With your contribution, we can change fashion life for those interested and start a movement, created by the EnCourage Sisterhood community, towards a world with more alternatives to fast forward fashion.
Worldwide changes might not happen overnight, but I hope that we with our honest effort can make a difference by reaching each other and others, who want to do fashion differently. And by, hopefully, encouraging other designers to create more garments that are based on sustainable aesthetics and actual user needs - not on short-lived fashion tendencies and quick income opportunities.
Let’s do our best to leave a noticeable footstep in the history of Fashion.
No contribution is too small (nor too big;)): From €1 to €50.000, all sizes of contributions are regarded as kind gestures towards making Fashion a different game!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>When Oana first started designing it was just a hobby, but her passion grew and she ended up in NYC at Parson’s School of Design to turn her interest into a skill. Now she has thousands of ideas sketched out and 30 ready to wear items. Her aptitude for choosing fabric textures, colors, and also the novelty of her cuts has turned into a beautiful line of clothing. The idea of creating a brand of beautiful, high quality, and comfortable clothing for women exciting in itself, but the added element of customizing each piece to its wearer offers women more space for self-expression and assures a perfect fit by eliminating the problem of unreliable sizing.</p>
<p>Alana is an American expat, a successful entrepreneur in Romania, passionate about life, art, and people. She joined the team as creative support and social media management. </p>
<p>WANNA shows the beauty and spirit of the strong woman in each of us: no matter how challenging or fortunate her present moment, she is grounded in her inner identity, which she expresses to the world through vibrant color, soft textures, extravagant shapes, leaving a strong impression.</p>

<p>We are a group of fashion marketing students in our final year at Northumbria University in Newcastle working very hard on our final collections and products.</p>
<p>Our plan is to take all of our lovely work down to Graduate Fashion Week in London and set up a lovely stall in Earl's Court to showcase all of our hard work. Hopefully this will help us all get one foot into the fashion world and possibly even some job offers! So, as you can tell this is a really important opportunity for us and we'd like it to be the best stall there!</p>
<p>This is where we need a bit of help....</p>
<p>To do this we need to raise at least £4,000 to help pay for the cost of hiring the space, transportation and most importantly the printing and distributing of our book containing everyone’s work.</p>
<p>We have already worked really hard and managed to raise £1,200 ourselves but need help from lovely people like you to help raise the rest. Your contributions will be completely anonymous and you can donate as much, or as little as you wish.</p>
<p>Your kindness will be hugely appreciated and will help towards promoting and launching creative new talent into the fashion industry.</p>

</div><h1><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">Project Description</span></h1><p>Arbo bracelet is a beautiful, unisex accessory with a mission. <b>For every bracelet sold, we will plant one tree!</b> So instead of getting just a cool, modern bracelet, you will get a tree of your own. Or if you are buying a gift to someone, now you can get a present that has more meaning than just a piece of jewellery.</p><p>Every year 81,000 km2 of forest gets cut down for various reasons. That is the size of Belgium and Netherlands together. At this rate of deforestation there will be no rainforests in 100 years. This is completely absurd when you take into consideration the fact that the<b> trees are by far our best ""technology"" to combat global warming. </b></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/275/166/4cba6da0459b5b864e76d83f25b458ff_original.jpg?v=1438906269&amp;w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=3abeb750560f774e2eb57b3f1d461fac"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p><p>What we hope to achieve with this campaign is to raise enough funds to order the materials needed to assemble the bracelets, and get this project going. We calculated that for the initial batch of bracelets we need at least $5,000 dollars. Everything that comes over the top is a bonus. </p><p>In these modern times, when we live faster than ever before, sometimes it is hard to stop and take a look around yourself. If we did that more often, we would understand how some of the choices we make, make no sense. We, as a group of people who are bound by this project and hope to make it into a successful company, are on a mission to give our contribution to saving the planet from overheating and saving some of the natural habitats for wild animals. Join us on this road and wear a cool bracelet! :)</p><h2>The Bracelet</h2><div>
<p>Our bracelet is <b>handmade</b> with care and materials that do not harm the nature. The artificial leather blends perfectly with the copper tree medallion, that has been chromed. In time, the medallion will oxidise and return to its natural colour. The bracelet does not require any maintenance, however, it is recommended to avoid direct contact with water. </p>

<p>The packaging and the instruction card that is within are made out of paper. Please recycle them once you have received the bracelet. </p>

</div><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges </h2><p></p><p>If we reach the targeted pledge, the production part should not be too difficult. We have already handmade the first ""test batch"" and the process is straightforward. </p><p>We already spoke to the company <a href=""http://www.weforest.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WeForest</a> which will plant trees (first planting space will be in India), for all the bracelets purchased worldwide.

Or if you are buying a gift to someone, now you can get a present that has more meaning than just a piece of jewellery.Every year 81,000 km2 of forest gets cut down for various reasons. That is the size of Belgium and Netherlands together. At this rate of deforestation there will be no rainforests in 100 years. This is completely absurd when you take into consideration the fact that the trees are by far our best ""technology"" to combat global warming.  What we hope to achieve with this campaign is to raise enough funds to order the materials needed to assemble the bracelets, and get this project going. We calculated that for the initial batch of bracelets we need at least $5,000 dollars. Everything that comes over the top is a bonus. In these modern times, when we live faster than ever before, sometimes it is hard to stop and take a look around yourself. If we did that more often, we would understand how some of the choices we make, make no sense. We, as a group of people who are bound by this project and hope to make it into a successful company, are on a mission to give our contribution to saving the planet from overheating and saving some of the natural habitats for wild animals. Join us on this road and wear a cool bracelet! :)The Bracelet
Our bracelet is handmade with care and materials that do not harm the nature. The artificial leather blends perfectly with the copper tree medallion, that has been chromed. In time, the medallion will oxidise and return to its natural colour. The bracelet does not require any maintenance, however, it is recommended to avoid direct contact with water. 







The packaging and the instruction card that is within are made out of paper. Please recycle them once you have received the bracelet. 

Risks & Challenges If we reach the targeted pledge, the production part should not be too difficult. We have already handmade the first ""test batch"" and the process is straightforward. We already spoke to the company WeForest which will plant trees (first planting space will be in India), for all the bracelets purchased worldwide. Since we are Serbian, from all the bracelets purchased in our country we will plant the trees ourselves in partnership with local governments (prior to starting this project we planted 200 trees already - which is how we got this idea in the first place).There might be an issue with shipping, since we are sending products from a non EU country to EU or to the US (or any other country). However, after consulting with the officials from the Post Office, we got the listing to shipping costs to all the countries according to the weight, and we got their reassurance that this type of product is not problematic to transport. We would like to think that we have the entire process which is to take place after a successful Indiegogo campaign planned out.

As the days go by, our perk pricing will gradually increase. So the earlier you make your contribution, the more money you’ll save!<br/><br/><strong>Q: I already backed the campaign. How do I choose my style?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> We want to give you as much time as possible to choose the style that’s right for you. Once the campaign is over, we’ll contact you via email to finalize your selection(s).<br/><br/><strong>Q: Can I contribute to more than one perk? For instance, can I buy two of the ROXFORD X2?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! You can fund multiple perks (as separate transactions) and keep track of them in the ‘My Contributions’ section of your Indiegogo account.<br/><br/><strong>Q: I backed the ROXFORD X2 perk. Can I mix and match Men’s and Women’s watches?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. At the end of the campaign, we’ll contact you via email to confirm which size(s) you want and the particular style for each.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Can I take it in the water?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes, and we hope you do! The analog watch has a water resistance rating of 10 ATM (100 meters) and the fitness tracker of 5 ATM (50 meters).<br/><br/><strong>Q: What does the wrap-around Silicone Air strap do?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> It’s a special strap that only attaches to either side of the fitness tracker, without the watch face. This makes it a lightweight fitness device that’s perfect for running or sleeping.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Is the strap length adjustable?</strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Yes, we’ve included a small screwdriver with every set, so you can add or remove steel links on either side of the buckle as needed.</p><p><strong>Q: What width are the straps?</strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Men's: 22mm, Women's: 18mm</p><p><strong>Q: Is there a warranty?</strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Absolutely. We want you to be completely happy with your purchase, so each Roxford comes with a 2 year warranty against manufacturer's defects. We will repair or replace it for free.       </p><p><strong>Q: Is VAT and import duties covered in the cost?</strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>No. Cardiff Design cannot be responsible for import tax duties imposed by your country. </p><p><br/><strong>Q: Does the fitness tracker measure heart rate?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> There is no heart sensor in the device, but we may offer a simple upgrade in the future.<br/><br/><strong>Q: Do you offer wholesale pricing for retailers?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes.

That's why each Roxford comes with four interchangeable bands and a sleek travel case, so you can easily customize the look and feel of your watch on the go.​  Aesthetically simplistic and sophisticated, the Roxford preserves a timeless minimalism that is both versatile and highly functional. From the hands down to the circuit board, our watches are built with style, comfort and quality in mind.     Most smartwatches on the market put the tracker in the watch face. We designed the Roxford with the smart technology inside the watch buckle. Our patent-pending design helps distribute weight evenly around your wrist for balance and comfort.    The Roxford tracks your steps, calories, distance and even your sleep patterns at night. It automatically collects activity data as you go about your daily life. It's so subtle, no one will notice you're even wearing a fitness tracker.  The Roxford interacts with your smartphone via Bluetooth, allowing you to concentrate on your workout, get a restful nights sleep, or give that big presentation at work. Review your daily activity with our easy-to-use mobile app. + Syncs with Apple Health, S Health, Fitbit and more...Each Roxford set comes with 4 interchangeable straps. We designed our watches to transition seamlessly from day to night, from work to the gym. Dress it up for a fancy night out, dress it down for a run. The choice is yours.  The wrap-around Silicone Air strap converts the hybrid watch into a traditional fitness band by removing the watch face altogether.   Our ergonomically designed straps feature quick-release pins that let you switch styles while on the move, in seconds. With six removable links (three on each side) you'll be able to easily resize the strap with a screwdriver (included) to fit your wrist.   You'll be able to control aspects of your phone by simply tapping the device. Triple-tap to play/pause the music playing on your phone. Double-tap to skip to the next track. Additional gestures will be added in the coming months during development!

 Cardiff Design, Inc., was founded by Nick Hallet, an aerospace engineer based in San Diego, California. With a passion for design and electronics, and a deep love for watches, Nick decided to follow his dream of creating a truly unique device. Since its inception, Cardiff Design has grown into an incredible team of engineers, craftsmen, and software developers. The team is motivated by blending exceptional technical design and high-quality components to help everyone move more, sleep better and improve their overall health.  What's Next?  Q: Why should I contribute to the campaign early?A: We’re giving special pricing incentives to those who contribute early. As the days go by, our perk pricing will gradually increase. So the earlier you make your contribution, the more money you’ll save!Q: I already backed the campaign. How do I choose my style?A: We want to give you as much time as possible to choose the style that’s right for you. Once the campaign is over, we’ll contact you via email to finalize your selection(s).Q: Can I contribute to more than one perk? For instance, can I buy two of the ROXFORD X2?A: Absolutely! You can fund multiple perks (as separate transactions) and keep track of them in the ‘My Contributions’ section of your Indiegogo account.Q: I backed the ROXFORD X2 perk. Can I mix and match Men’s and Women’s watches?A: Absolutely. At the end of the campaign, we’ll contact you via email to confirm which size(s) you want and the particular style for each.Q: Can I take it in the water?A: Yes, and we hope you do! The analog watch has a water resistance rating of 10 ATM (100 meters) and the fitness tracker of 5 ATM (50 meters).Q: What does the wrap-around Silicone Air strap do?A: It’s a special strap that only attaches to either side of the fitness tracker, without the watch face. This makes it a lightweight fitness device that’s perfect for running or sleeping.Q: Is the strap length adjustable?A: Yes, we’ve included a small screwdriver with every set, so you can add or remove steel links on either side of the buckle as needed.Q: What width are the straps?A: Men's: 22mm, Women's: 18mmQ: Is there a warranty?A: Absolutely. We want you to be completely happy with your purchase, so each Roxford comes with a 2 year warranty against manufacturer's defects. We will repair or replace it for free.       Q: Is VAT and import duties covered in the cost?A: No. Cardiff Design cannot be responsible for import tax duties imposed by your country. Q: Does the fitness tracker measure heart rate?A: There is no heart sensor in the device, but we may offer a simple upgrade in the future.Q: Do you offer wholesale pricing for retailers?A: Yes. Please email us at info@cardiff-design.com and we’d be happy to explore the possibilities.Q: Is your invention patented?A: It is currently patent pending (Utility).Q: How do I ask a question that’s not on this list!A: We welcome all questions that come to mind in the COMMENTS section. Just post a comment and one of us will get back to you ASAP :)  Thank you! Our watches are already scheduled for mass production next month! Please share our campaign, and thank you for backing us.",51.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Allmade was founded by a group of screen printers who believe there is a better way to make a shirt.</p>
<p>2 billion t-shirts are produced every year, using fibers like industrial cotton, which is often grown in regions with minimal regulations—directly exposing workers and the environment to deadly pesticides and herbicides that are outlawed in the U.S.</p>
<p>These materials are then transported across the globe using bunker fuel, a heavy oil residue so toxic most countries won’t let ships use it within 200 miles of shore.</p>
<p>They are then spun into yarn, knitted into fabric, and sewn into garments by workers, some of whom are children, in sweatshop conditions, for a wage that does not allow them to meet even their most basic needs. In countries like Haiti, this translates to an increase in orphans, many of whom’s parents were forced to give them up because they couldn’t afford to care for them.</p>
<p>All of which allows a handful of large manufacturers to sell the blank garments at a low, wholesale rate to screen printers, who then sell t-shirts with printed designs to consumers.</p>
<p>The increased cost of sustainable materials often prevents screen printers from offering better choices to their customers, many of whom are unknowledgeable about the conditions under which their shirts are made—resulting in a pattern of exploitative production.</p>
<p>At Allmade, we’ve decided it’s time to change the pattern. And we need your help.</p>

Project:</u></b></h2>
<p>One of my favorite gifts at my bridal shower was a framed
art project I made in pre-school. The writing prompt was “What do you want to
be when you grow up, Cassie?’ I answered simply, “I want to be a bride. I am
going to dance with my husband.” It’s funny looking back, realizing my passion
for weddings began as early as age 3. </p>
<p>My name is Cassie Wanda and I left the best job I ever had
last year to pursue a career in design. I absolutely love creating costumes and
playing the role of “fairy godmother” to my clients, however, I am here to ask
your help in pursuing my own dream further, the dream of creating my very own
wedding dress line. I’ve been developing the theme and sketches for about 4
months now, working very hard to present something to you that I am not only
proud of, but truly believe will help brides-to-be find their dream fantasy
wedding gown. </p>
<p>Finding my own dress was not the best experience, I knew
what I wanted and had an extremely hard time finding an off-the-rack dress that
felt like “me.” I went to a snooty boutique that I didn’t feel like cared
whether or not I booked. After weeks of searching I was lucky to find a
seamstress that was willing to tweak one of her own designs to add a few
elements that I specifically wanted. I was elated! The dress was what I wanted
and she was great to deal with. I want to make every bride who comes to me feel
special, loved, and listened to in creating her dream dress.</p>
<p>I want to thank you so much for reading this and supporting
me in any way. I truly feel that there is magic in this world knowing I am able
to make a living doing what I love for a job! Now, with your help, I will be
able to do it on a much more magnificent scale. Thank you. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2 align=""center"">

The
Project:
One of my favorite gifts at my bridal shower was a framed
art project I made in pre-school. The writing prompt was “What do you want to
be when you grow up, Cassie?’ I answered simply, “I want to be a bride. I am
going to dance with my husband.” It’s funny looking back, realizing my passion
for weddings began as early as age 3. 
My name is Cassie Wanda and I left the best job I ever had
last year to pursue a career in design. I absolutely love creating costumes and
playing the role of “fairy godmother” to my clients, however, I am here to ask
your help in pursuing my own dream further, the dream of creating my very own
wedding dress line. I’ve been developing the theme and sketches for about 4
months now, working very hard to present something to you that I am not only
proud of, but truly believe will help brides-to-be find their dream fantasy
wedding gown. 
Finding my own dress was not the best experience, I knew
what I wanted and had an extremely hard time finding an off-the-rack dress that
felt like “me.” I went to a snooty boutique that I didn’t feel like cared
whether or not I booked. After weeks of searching I was lucky to find a
seamstress that was willing to tweak one of her own designs to add a few
elements that I specifically wanted. I was elated! The dress was what I wanted
and she was great to deal with. I want to make every bride who comes to me feel
special, loved, and listened to in creating her dream dress.
I want to thank you so much for reading this and supporting
me in any way. I truly feel that there is magic in this world knowing I am able
to make a living doing what I love for a job! Now, with your help, I will be
able to do it on a much more magnificent scale. Thank you. 
Dresses:

The Glimmerwood Element Wedding Line is inspired by the Classical elements. Air, Water, Fire, Earth, and the most important element, Love, influenced these flowing fantasy gowns.Are you going to be swept into your ceremony riding the winds or waves? Will you rise up from the Earth in all your beauty or burn with passionate fire? Do you want to make a memory as queen for the day?Read on to find out which dress is for you!


The Air Bride: 

  Want
to feel like a Grecian Goddess on your wedding day? You will find your match as
the Air Bride. Silk chiffon drapes along, moving with you and the wind. A regal drape comes from the shoulder and tucks into the waist; It
will have you dancing and twirling all day! The fabric is a gorgeous silk
chiffon that transitions slowly from white to sky blue. 


The Water Bride: 

  Mermaids,
the sea, and water nymphs inspired this dress. Delicate beaded lace with green and
opal gives the effect of abalone and pearls on the front of the bodice. Ripples of lace and silk chiffon move in a way that will have your
guests wondering if you are moving under water!



The Fire Bride: 

  The
Fire Bride dress is for the edgy girl. This dress is the most versatile of the
collection. The bra top and under bust are both are adorned with gorgeous black

<i>The Inspiration for Kleynimals </i><br/>
</div>
<div>My name is Kirsten Chapman, and I am a mom of two boys, currently ages 10 and 7.  I invented Kleynimals - Clean Key Animals in 2008 because my youngest son put everything in his mouth.  I wanted a safe toy for his ""oral fixation,"" and I could not find anything that satisfied either of us (safety for me, something akin to keys for him).  Stainless steel toy keys seemed like a logical toy to me.  They could be made of a safe material that could provide that cold metal feel and texture he seemed to desire.   </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436223748/nkyi7vogrwqen1huozst.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>It took me two years to get my product to market as I navigated the new-to-me world of inventing, manufacturing, and marketing a children's product.  I was truly inspired to create a product that made parents feel confident that they were purchasing a safe product from a company that never compromises on integrity.  Hopefully, you take the time to watch my video and see that my toy keys have been an absolute labor of love.  Kleynimals have never been a money making proposition.  They have always been about providing the best product in the ""right way.""  Thus, to be honest, the only compromise has been on my end, with both my finances and my time.  </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436223776/rmjb6nf7ad3haqabikag.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<div>
<i>Kleynimals- ready to grow</i> <br/>
</div>
<div>For the past 4 years, I have ""piecemealed"" my product together, getting parts from Chicago and Wisconsin shipped to me in Annapolis, Maryland.  A local organization that works with developmentally disabled people (The Providence Center) helped me assemble and wash my product.  A local welder welded and buffed the ring.  It was a hugely labor intensive process and it took a lot out of me, as the time investment on my end was huge.  </div>
</div>
<div>Thankfully, I recently learned that Sherrill Manufacturing was back in operation in upstate New York.  When I first looked to find a manufacturer for Kleynimals back in 2008, it made sense to me that I should find a flatware manufacturer.  However, after searching long and hard, I learned that NO ONE was making flatware in the USA, even if it was an American company.  Everything was manufactured overseas.  Thankfully, Sherrill started up the plant in NY again, and now that is where Kleynimals are made. I always hoped to create a Kleynimals ""Line,"" but I did not have the time, nor did I have the manufacturing capabilities to keep up with any kind of demand prior to finding Sherrill.  Now that Kleynimals are assembled and welded in one stop (the ring is still from Wisconsin), I am excited to be able to introduce a new product!<br/>

<p><i>Sketches of our Kleynimals Flatware featuring Eli the Elephant, Gus the Giraffe and Leo the Lion.</i><br/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div><i>Made in the USA</i></div>
<div>Thankfully, there is a big focus on finding products Made in the USA now, and bringing manufacturing jobs ""back to America.""  But, when I first set out to make Kleynimals, that was not necessarily the case.  I feel passionately about making more safe products in the USA, thus providing more options to parents who think it's important to provide their babies with trustworthy products and who value supporting the American economy with their purchases.  <br/>

</div>
<div>As far as revenue and sales go, while the people that know Kleynimals love Kleynimals, not enough people know about them.  But honestly, with the manufacturing process the way it was, I was almost nervous to have a ""big break,"" as I wasn't sure that I could meet the demand.  <br/>
</div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div><i>Truly, a ""labor of love""</i></div>
<div>So, given all of that, why do I continue with this business that doesn't generate personal cash flow?  I do it because I love it.  I thrive off of the positive feedback I receive from parents who tell me that Kleynimals are a family favorite.  I LOVE hearing the jingling sound of Kleynimals on a plane or in another public setting.  While most people wouldn't notice it, I can hear the jingle from a mile away and I am then on the lookout for the Kleynimals loving baby!  It makes me so happy to think that Kleynimals are bringing joy to a child and that parents can feel confident in their safety.  <br/>
</div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>

</div><p>Please use the IndieGoGo sharing tools to tell your friends about Kleynimals toy keys and flatware!  </p><p></p></div>","Let’s face it- there
is a problem with plastics (what’s in that stuff!??).  Plastics create a worry for parents- a worry
of whether their child is being exposed to harmful chemicals like BPA or
phthalates.  In the market today, many
children’s flatware is made from plastic. 
The ones that are made from stainless steel are made overseas, which
create a whole other problem (environmental footprint with shipping, contaminated metal, worker conditions)!  




We sought
out to find a solution.  Kleynimals
Flatware will provide a solution to this “kitchen conundrum,” providing parents
with a groundbreaking non-toxic, stainless steel, environmentally
friendly, USA-made flatware collection for children.  Contemporary and inventive, Kleynimals
Flatware is beautifully designed with the cute faces of our ""Kleynimals animals"" and with your child’s health in mind.

Our goal at
Kleynimals is to provide parents with the sound knowledge that they are
purchasing a product that is:


Safe for
their children’s health 
Environmentally
friendly
Made in
the USA
A practical keepsake that can be used daily and washed in the dishwasher



                                                           





 






Why Stainless?



Non-toxic- Stainless steel eliminates the worry over
chemicals like BPA or phthalates.  And
because Kleynimals flatware will be made in the U.S., parents can be
sure that kids are not putting lead or cadmium in their mouths.


Dishwasher
safe- Stainless steel is non-corrosive
and rust-resistant.


Easy
to Clean- Stainless steel is a more
hygienic option since it has easy cleaning properties, which is the reason it is
used in hospitals, kitchens, and laboratories. 


Longevity-
Impact resistant and long-lasting


Green-
Stainless steel is 100% recyclable
and the average stainless steel product contains over 50% recycled
material. 









The Inspiration for Kleynimals 

My name is Kirsten Chapman, and I am a mom of two boys, currently ages 10 and 7.  I invented Kleynimals - Clean Key Animals in 2008 because my youngest son put everything in his mouth.  I wanted a safe toy for his ""oral fixation,"" and I could not find anything that satisfied either of us (safety for me, something akin to keys for him).  Stainless steel toy keys seemed like a logical toy to me.  They could be made of a safe material that could provide that cold metal feel and texture he seemed to desire.   




It took me two years to get my product to market as I navigated the new-to-me world of inventing, manufacturing, and marketing a children's product.  I was truly inspired to create a product that made parents feel confident that they were purchasing a safe product from a company that never compromises on integrity.  Hopefully, you take the time to watch my video and see that my toy keys have been an absolute labor of love.  Kleynimals have never been a money making proposition.  They have always been about providing the best product in the ""right way.""  Thus, to be honest, the only compromise has been on my end, with both my finances and my time.  






Kleynimals- ready to grow 

For the past 4 years, I have ""piecemealed"" my product together, getting parts from Chicago and Wisconsin shipped to me in Annapolis, Maryland.  A local organization that works with developmentally disabled people (The Providence Center) helped me assemble and wash my product.  A local welder welded and buffed the ring.  It was a hugely labor intensive process and it took a lot out of me, as the time investment on my end was huge.  

Thankfully, I recently learned that Sherrill Manufacturing was back in operation in upstate New York.  When I first looked to find a manufacturer for Kleynimals back in 2008, it made sense to me that I should find a flatware manufacturer.  However, after searching long and hard, I learned that NO ONE was making flatware in the USA, even if it was an American company.  Everything was manufactured overseas.  Thankfully, Sherrill started up the plant in NY again, and now that is where Kleynimals are made. I always hoped to create a Kleynimals ""Line,"" but I did not have the time, nor did I have the manufacturing capabilities to keep up with any kind of demand prior to finding Sherrill.  Now that Kleynimals are assembled and welded in one stop (the ring is still from Wisconsin), I am excited to be able to introduce a new product!





Sketches of our Kleynimals Flatware featuring Eli the Elephant, Gus the Giraffe and Leo the Lion.


Made in the USA
Thankfully, there is a big focus on finding products Made in the USA now, and bringing manufacturing jobs ""back to America.""  But, when I first set out to make Kleynimals, that was not necessarily the case.  I feel passionately about making more safe products in the USA, thus providing more options to parents who think it's important to provide their babies with trustworthy products and who value supporting the American economy with their purchases.  





The making of our first prototype at Sherrill Manufacturing. 



Honesty is hugely important to me, so at the risk of ""oversharing,"" I will share with you the financial situation for me with Kleynimals.  When I started Kleynimals, I did so with personal money and a gift from my parents.  I have always tried to run Kleynimals really ""leanly,"" and have never been in a position to pay myself.  All of the revenue I make goes back into the company.  I have had a couple of barely profitable years, that essentially just mean that I owe money in taxes!  My former manufacturing process did not always produce ideal product, which meant I ended up having to recycle a lot of product that did not meet my high standards.  As a result, I was spending a lot of money on product that I could not sell, which is never good for the bottom line. 

As far as revenue and sales go, while the people that know Kleynimals love Kleynimals, not enough people know about them.  But honestly, with the manufacturing process the way it was, I was almost nervous to have a ""big break,"" as I wasn't sure that I could meet the demand.  


Truly, a ""labor of love""
So, given all of that, why do I continue with this business that doesn't generate personal cash flow?  I do it because I love it.  I thrive off of the positive feedback I receive from parents who tell me that Kleynimals are a family favorite.  I LOVE hearing the jingling sound of Kleynimals on a plane or in another public setting.  While most people wouldn't notice it, I can hear the jingle from a mile away and I am then on the lookout for the Kleynimals loving baby!  It makes me so happy to think that Kleynimals are bringing joy to a child and that parents can feel confident in their safety.  


What I need from you
So, since I don't make enough money to pay myself, I also don't have the company funds to invest in new dies to make the new product, as well as the first batch to manufacture them.  If I can generate $22,000 in donations for this idea, I will have enough to back the first 1000 sets of Kleynimals flatware.  The majority of the funding will go towards the dies, which will be a fixed asset that I can use time and time again to produce more sets of flatware.  If I do not reach the entire goal, the funds will still go towards this effort to make Kleynimals flatware.  However, it may delay the time in which I can launch the product, as I will have to seek another revenue source in the meantime.

<p></p></div>","I am Adriana Bertini an Artvist from south of Brazil. I was born in 02/02/1971.Since
1995 I have worked as an artist and activist in the fight against AIDS in
Brazil and worldwide.
Dress
Up Against AIDS are costumes that I create with condoms that are part of
industrial production fault, I propose through the art exhibition multidisciplinary
debate to prevent HIV/AIDS.
From
20 to July 25, 2014 Happens 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne,
Australia.
It
is the biggest event which brings together more than 20 thousand people from
all over the world. Activist, doctors, scientists, health officials, opinion
leaders etc … with the same goal in common: to study, learn and share
experiences against HIV / AIDS.
I
have the support of the National STD / AIDS of the Ministry of Health of Brazil
to attend the conference.
What
do we do at the conference:
The
exhibition Dress Up Against AIDS, with 5 condom dresses, monitoring with
reflections with the public, presenting an unprecedented tool through art to
break the taboo providing dialogue humorously.
What
we need: 
1
round trip from São Paulo / Melbourne / São Paulo 
USD
5.000, 
Print
2,000 folders
USD
2,200
Your
support is very important for us!
Thank
you so much!
Campanha
de Doação
Como
vocês sabem desde 1995 tenho atuado como artista plástica e ativista na luta
contra a aids na minha comunidade, no Brasil e no mundo.
Vista-se
Contra a AIDS:  São figurinos que eu crio com camisinhas que fazem parte da
falha de produção industrial, proponho através da exposição de arte um debate
multidisciplinar para a prevenção a HIV/AIDS.
De
20 a 25 de Julho de 2014 acontece a 20th International AIDS Conference em
Melbourne, Australia.
É
o maior evento onde reúne mais de 20 mil pessoas de toda parte do mundo.
Ativista, médicos, cientistas, agentes de saúde, formadores de opinião,  etc… com 1 objetivo: estudar, aprender,
compartilhar experiências contra a epidemia.
Eu
tenho o apoio do Programa Nacional de DST/AIDS do Ministério da Saúde do Brasil
para participar da conferência.
Mas
não consegui ainda o suporte para levar a Joana minha assistente. Ela é
fundamental para a exposição, pois fazer a montagem, desmontagem e atenter mais
de 20 mil pessoas sozinha na conferencia é impossivel uma vez que trabalho a 4
mãos! Por isso tive a ideia de fazer esta campanha de arrecadação de dinheiro
de vocês meus amigos do face.
Minha
pergunta é voce poderia doar R$ 5, 10, 15, 20 ou R$ 50 reais para o meu
projeto?
O
dinheiro doado vai ser investido em:
1
passagem aérea floripa/ melbourne/floripa
e para  impressão de 2.000 folfers.
Se
você acredita que meu trabalho pode fazer a diferença em educar uma poplulação
em risco do hiv por favor doe o quanto puder!
Para
doar é facil basta ter cartao de credito ou uma conta no paypal, quando a
campanha tiver atingido a meta ela se encerra!

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Quite-a-Quote is a fusion of an Art and Typography. We are two friends with these very different
passions and skills. We managed to pair them up in vintage style quote wall
decorations. While we have created hand drawn plain blackboard’n’chalk designs

murals, but we need your help to make it happen.</span><br/></p><p></p>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our dream.</span></h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Conventional decoration of this type is simple and inexpensive
– a tin of blackboard paint and a chalk or a chalk marker. Vinyl wall decorations
on other hand require a workplace, a cutter machine, and a software and wall
decal material. While currently we’re borrowing the cutter and working on friend’s
sign maker software we would love to set up our own workshop and an easy to use
and browse online e-gallery where everyone can see what we do and buy it if
they see something they like. Any contribution to help us reach that goal would
be much appreciated and every single one will be thanked in the webpage when it’s
live.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; font-size: 30px; line-height: 38px; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Why wall decal? Why not
poster or other printed media?</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The beauty of wall decal is that it looks like painted
directly on the wall but it’s completely mess free and is so easy to apply. It
becomes one with the wall. We are aiming for that stylish and laconic look with
a good dash of vintage style.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Creation of the design
and the decal.</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Every decal design starts off with the blank blackboard and
the design is hand sketched on it. The sketch is loaded into a computer and is
converted into line drawing. The line pattern is then cut into a very thin
vinyl film. Then the excess vinyl is removed from the rest of the design and it
is covered with so called transfer film. Design is ready to travel. Please
watch our stop motion video to show this process.</span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Bikini Hockey League is giving hockey fans what they want: HOCKEY. With the NHL currently locked out and the cancelation of the Winter Classic, the BHL is stepping up to the rink to kick off 2013 with the first Bikini Hockey League Winter Classic!</p>
<p>The BHL started as a concept to generate a reality show and is currently in talks to get production going soon.  Initially, the concept revolved around roller hockey. But when the NHL started dragging negotiaions and BHL players wanted to fill the hockey void, these female athletes wanted to put their bikini's on ice. The first game will revive the NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day in Detroit at the Greak Lakes Sport City.</p>
<p>The power of the bikini, hockey and hatred of your choice (NHL Commissioner Bettman or NHLPA) will fuel this game to a crescendo. While the NHL squabbles over millions, fans can watch the BHL live in Detroit or on pay-per-view and get their hockey fix. The BHL players are not only beautiful but talented and will give it all they've got for three intense periods.

<p><br/>If contributors get behind this first game, it will fuel jobs, economics and fun.

<p>The funding will help bring together some of the finest femaie hockey players from across the US and Canada.  Funds are needed to bring all players together (travel) and then secure hotel, ground transportation and catering.  A venue has been located to pracitce and play the actual game.  Uniforms, coaches, referee's....the list goes on!</p>
<p>The budget calls for 60% of funding to come from sponsorships and 40% to come from ticket sales.  Funding secured through Indiegogo will be part of the 60% sponsorship estimate.</p>

<ul>
<li>1. I personally wear T-shirts and look at them as more than just an article of clothing. they are seen as an outlet for expression in my opinion and <strong>SAY</strong> a great deal about the wearer of said fabric.</li>
<li>2. I always have random thoughts and most of the time I'm left with ""<strong>I need a t-shirt that says that.</strong>""</li>
<li>3. I like to connect with people! It's a great feeling to be somewhere and someone randomly comments on how they can relate to the shirt that you have on. That is a great feeling and I want to help others meet new people without saying a word!</li>

<h3>Die Idee</h3>
<p>Wie die Mutter, so die Tochter - Den Kleiderschrank voller Klamotten, aber doch nichts zum anziehen! Mit dem ziemlich sicheren Wissen, nicht als Einzige mit diesem Problem konfrontiert zu sein, kam Cornelia und Viktoria Ngotse die Idee zu '<strong>Swapaholics'</strong>.</p>
<p>Wer kennt es nicht: Irgendwie passt das Shirt vom letzten Sommer nicht mehr so recht zu deinem Stil, die neue Jeans sitzt doch nicht so gut und den Pulli, der eigentlich so toll war, zieht man nie an. Die besten Freundinnen sind zum tauschen zu weit weg. Zum Wegschmeißen ist diese Kleidung zu schade, aber stundenlang auf dem Flohmarkt sitzen möchte man auch nicht. Bei 'Swapaholics' erhält jeder die Möglichkeit, mit Millionen von Usern zu tauschen und somit praktisch virtuell z.B. in den Kleiderschränken der Freundinnen oder der Lieblingsbloggerin zu stöbern.</p>

<h3>Und so funktioniert's!</h3>
<p>Ob Frau, Mann oder Kind: Jeder kann seine gut erhaltene Kleidung auf Swapaholics einstellen. Im Gegenzug erhaltet ihr für eure eingestellten Kleidungsstücke Swap-Chips auf eurem Nutzerkonto gutgeschrieben.

<p>My name is Raul ""Rulli"" Torres. I'm a Fashion Designer based in Dallas, Texas. The Fashion Industry has exploded and now everyone wants to be part of it. Fashion is easier said than done! The Glamour and spotlight are amazing but not everyone knows how much work is involved. I've spent sleepless nights working on garments for customers and fashion shows but I absolutely love it. I wouldn't change it for anything in the world. As we all know it's almost impossible to get bank loans. That is why I am seeking your help. I know I have a shot in the industry. Below are some images of my work and items that will be be sold on my online store. Please message me if you have any suggestions. Thank you! </p>
<p>I am currently working with some suppliers to retail items on line. I will also be working with them to mass produce ""some"" of my designs. As we all know it is not cheap to mass produce anything. </p>

You will receive your item/perk as on the date indicated after the campaign is over. Some of these perks will help me promote my brand and will help me to invest in some more inventory. Lets say I make $5000 on the t-shirts. I will take that money and invest it on purchasing some obviously. I want to continue to sell t-shirts, blazers, hats, and add to my online store. </div><div>Below are photos are some of the items I will be selling online.

I'm always giving back to non-profit organizations and our community one way or another. I always give people an opportunity to be part of my fashion shows. This is a unique and wonderful experience. I will continue to do so because you all have been very supportive of my career. I want to continue to inspire others. If you stay true to your self, accept failures, get back up, keep trying, don't give up and eventually you will achieve your goals and dreams. 


I have a few perks on here. I want you to receive something in return for your donation. You have the option of choosing a perk. You will receive your item/perk as on the date indicated after the campaign is over. Some of these perks will help me promote my brand and will help me to invest in some more inventory. Lets say I make $5000 on the t-shirts. I will take that money and invest it on purchasing some obviously. I want to continue to sell t-shirts, blazers, hats, and add to my online store. Below are photos are some of the items I will be selling online. Mostly everything will be ready to wear and ""Normal size"" other wise know as Plus size. Note: Not all of the items will be designed by me. Most of them items will be retail (bought from suppliers to sell online)













I also have a few perks where are pure contributions and will not receive anything in return. 
Please message me if you have any questions, concerns, opinions, or how I can improve my campaign. Please share with friends and anyone who might be interested in helping me out. SOME MORE PHOTOS OF MY WORK BELOW! photos by: Thomas Garza",21.0,1,"1 Campaign

</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">As
my wife and I were starting a small screen-printing business out of
our garage, we sat up one night talking about how we wanted to do
something that impacted people more than just 'another t-shirt shop'.
After months of throwing our idea around, we thought we'd try it out
and see where it went. </span><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/threadsforus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Threads
for US</b></a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""> was
born the summer of 2013. Once friends and family showed interest in
what we were doing, we decided to do a pre-order through our Facebook
to see how many shirts we could sell. We started the pre-order in mid
October, 2013 and it ran for a month. We sold quite a few shirts and
learned a lot during the process. This experience is what motivated
us to start our campaign.<br/></span></p><p></p>
<p>
<br/>Our
focus has shifted primarily to <a href=""http://www.threadsfor.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Threads
for US</b></a> because
we feel our idea can not only help provide for our small family, but
can also help many more families throughout the U.S. We are still
doing printing jobs for local businesses to help gain skill,
knowledge, and an income for our family, but all with the goal to
bring <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/threadsforus"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Threads
for US</b></a> to
the next level.<br/><br/><b>What is Threads for US?<br/></b><br/>Threads for US is a t-shirt company with a simple business model. With every shirt sold, we make another one that is the same style and design on a youth shirt and donate it to a child in need. Not only are the shirts donated to children in the US, but they are also made and printed here as well. We aim to empower kids of all ages by providing them with high quality clothing with style. <br/><br/><b>Who
gets the donated shirts?</b> </p>
<p>We have been in contact with many different organizations throughout the
country that primarily deal with children who are either homeless,
abused, orphaned, or in a low-income home. Every three months we will
choose a place where the shirts will be donated and deliver them
there in person. Once <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/threadsforus"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Threads
for US</b></a> picks
up, our goal is to do this every month! Each person that buys a shirt
will receive an email when their shirt is donated to inform them
which city and organization the donation was made to. Doing so allows
the process to be more personal for everyone and will give you the
satisfaction of knowing where your 'sister shirt' now lives!</p>
<p>
<b>What will
we use the money for?</b></p>
<p>
First, we would like to upgrade some of our equipment, which is all 20 to 25
years old. As of right now, we are able to print what we need, but
there is a lot of room for improvement. With a new printing press, we can print more efficiently and precisely. This will allow the use of
more colors in the designs and a quicker print time all around. Along
with the press, we'd like to upgrade our conveyor dryer. It is not
very energy efficient and takes a long time to reach the right
operating temperature.</p>
<p>
Second, we would like to start keeping a small stock of shirts so when orders
come in, we can pack and ship them that week. We would keep this
inventory to a minimum for now to ensure there is not too much
over-stock.</p>

All Shirts
are Tri-Blend (50% poly, 37% cotton, 13% rayon), which means they are
VERY soft and light weight. They are printed with a process called
discharge. Using this technique gives the design on the shirt little
to no feel at all!</p><p></p></div>","As
my wife and I were starting a small screen-printing business out of
our garage, we sat up one night talking about how we wanted to do
something that impacted people more than just 'another t-shirt shop'.
After months of throwing our idea around, we thought we'd try it out
and see where it went. Threads
for US was
born the summer of 2013. Once friends and family showed interest in
what we were doing, we decided to do a pre-order through our Facebook
to see how many shirts we could sell. We started the pre-order in mid
October, 2013 and it ran for a month. We sold quite a few shirts and
learned a lot during the process. This experience is what motivated
us to start our campaign.

Our
focus has shifted primarily to Threads
for US because
we feel our idea can not only help provide for our small family, but
can also help many more families throughout the U.S. We are still
doing printing jobs for local businesses to help gain skill,
knowledge, and an income for our family, but all with the goal to
bring Threads
for US to
the next level.What is Threads for US?Threads for US is a t-shirt company with a simple business model. With every shirt sold, we make another one that is the same style and design on a youth shirt and donate it to a child in need. Not only are the shirts donated to children in the US, but they are also made and printed here as well. We aim to empower kids of all ages by providing them with high quality clothing with style. Who
gets the donated shirts? 
We have been in contact with many different organizations throughout the
country that primarily deal with children who are either homeless,
abused, orphaned, or in a low-income home. Every three months we will
choose a place where the shirts will be donated and deliver them
there in person. Once Threads
for US picks
up, our goal is to do this every month! Each person that buys a shirt
will receive an email when their shirt is donated to inform them
which city and organization the donation was made to. Doing so allows
the process to be more personal for everyone and will give you the
satisfaction of knowing where your 'sister shirt' now lives!

What will
we use the money for?

First, we would like to upgrade some of our equipment, which is all 20 to 25
years old. As of right now, we are able to print what we need, but
there is a lot of room for improvement. With a new printing press, we can print more efficiently and precisely. This will allow the use of
more colors in the designs and a quicker print time all around. Along
with the press, we'd like to upgrade our conveyor dryer. It is not
very energy efficient and takes a long time to reach the right
operating temperature.

Second, we would like to start keeping a small stock of shirts so when orders
come in, we can pack and ship them that week. We would keep this
inventory to a minimum for now to ensure there is not too much
over-stock.

We
would also like to use the money to design some new graphics
for Threads
for US.
What is available right now is just a small amount of what we would
like to have. We want to have enough to keep people interested in us
and to give kids more to choose from when the donations are made.

Here's the
Break-Down!



	$10,000 for

The Craft Wallet
After searching for a small wallet that could carry more than just cards I decided to make the Craft Wallet.
The Craft Wallet is both very practical and thin. With just 8mm of thickness it can hold up to 7 normal cards and it couldn't be easier to take them out.

  
Just Push The Button 
The Craft Wallet mechanical system allows you to slide out your cards in a second and choose easily because they will come out in stair.
 

Because a Wallet isn't just for cards, on the back of the Craft Wallet there is a small pocket where you can store up to 5 cards, coins and bills so that you can be ready for anything that comes in your day while keeping a thin and small wallet.
 

On our website you can costumize your wallet choosing between the 7 diferent leather colors available and the two anodization colors available.

<p>Hill Climbing is one of the oldest forms of Motorsport. It is a branch of Motorsport in which drivers compete against time to complete an uphill course and is therefore a battle against time. As the drivers climb toward the summit, the thin air slows reflexes and reduces muscle strength. The thin air also robs engines of to 30% of their power. Competitors and vehicles must be in top shape simply to finish…let alone win!</p>

<p>In hill climbing every tenth of a second counts; therefore we decided to create a timepiece with a special chronograph movement which is able to measure time down to one tenth of a second. It’s dial is inspired by the early mechanical stop watches who where used at motor sporting events.</p>

</div><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>Because of our thorough investigation of our production process and excessive sample testing we are very confident that the will not be greats risks or challenges to this project, the only reel challenge is to get enough support from the indigogo community to set all wheels in motion</p><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/kickstarter%20basics#Acco"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><p></p><br/></div>","Hi everybody, thank you for visiting our indigogo page! We are a couple of guys who share a passion for watches and vintage motor sport, therefore we decided to create an elegant and timeless watch brand in spirit of vintage motorsport.






Camber Watches are all about fine watch making and vintage motorsport. We are planning to create different chapters of this story. Our first chapter tells the story of one of the oldest forms of motor sport: The Hillclimb






Hill Climbing is one of the oldest forms of Motorsport. It is a branch of Motorsport in which drivers compete against time to complete an uphill course and is therefore a battle against time. As the drivers climb toward the summit, the thin air slows reflexes and reduces muscle strength. The thin air also robs engines of to 30% of their power. Competitors and vehicles must be in top shape simply to finish…let alone win!




In hill climbing every tenth of a second counts; therefore we decided to create a timepiece with a special chronograph movement which is able to measure time down to one tenth of a second. It’s dial is inspired by the early mechanical stop watches who where used at motor sporting events.

 Blacksteel combination

Especially for this kickstarter campaign we managed to create great watch sets complete with matching cufflinks and original packaging for all backers for only €88 ($98) including free world wide shipping! Sets of multiple watches are even less expensive
A litle extra: Because we already reached our stretch goals earlier we will provide EVERY Camber watch set with 2 extra watch straps!

2: Tyre track strap

 To complete you appearance we designed a special vintage steering wheel shaped cufflinks, matching the watch.

Also we are planning to keep this packaging for future editions so it’s a great feature to collect all the different chapters next to each other.

All the ideas we had for camber watches came to life with the amazing work of Bart de Keyzer of www.3rd-floor.org and all the great pictures are made by Eva Meijer www.evameijer.com


Risks and challengesBecause of our thorough investigation of our production process and excessive sample testing we are very confident that the will not be greats risks or challenges to this project, the only reel challenge is to get enough support from the indigogo community to set all wheels in motion",46.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The light bulb for the <b>EM</b>PACK came to me when I was at the CrossFit Games watching my girlfriend compete. I was stuck in a hotel with absolutely no gym, and I was desperate to workout. I didn't just want to do typical bodyweight movements, like air squats and burpees. I wanted to lift! So, I took a suitcase, stuffed it with everything remotely heavy in the hotel room, and I lifted. It was tough, I was sore, and it made me realize that I needed to create something that not only would allow for amazing, effective workouts wherever you were, but could help my clients easily increase weight as they got stronger without spending a fortune on equipment!</p>
<div data-id=""5279717""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Never thought I would say this, but that pocket size is more convenient than my fannypack."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1457558959/xzpp4wr7vicdp2iqtpr7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Never thought I would say this, but that pocket size is more convenient than my fannypack.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p><b>THE WEIGHT </b></p>
<p>My double sealed water bladders are extremely durable yet take no room in your <b>EM</b>PACK when not in use. Keep them filled and in your car ready to go. Keep them filled and in your own gym. Empty them, travel, and fill as needed! Hike up a mountain or sprint up the stairs with the added weight, but save your knees for when you come back down! </p>
<p>AS YOU GET STRONGER, YOU JUST ADD MORE WATER.</p>
<p>Each bladder holds 15 pounds of unstable weight, and the Pack holds 4 bladders total. This unstable weight that is shifting with you as you move makes the weight not only more challenging, but more effective. </p>
<p><b>MADE FOR EVERY LIFESTYLE</b></p>
<p>The <b>EM</b>PACK was created to make working out seamless no matter where you go. From business trips to mountain hikes, it provides the flexibility and durability to go where life takes you.</p>
<p><b>DESIGN</b></p>
<p>This weight training pack was born out of the need for everyday people to get an everyday workout without all the equipment. Fit, form and function was key in its design. It fits smoothly to all body styles. The form is modern and stylish, and the function is flexible to meet your training needs. Its military-grade durability allows it to stand up to the toughest workouts and the harshest weather. The <b>EM</b>PACK was also designed with the versatility to go on the road, be kept in your car, or used at home.</p>
<p><b>PRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>Through lots of trial and error, time and money the EMPACK will be U.S. made in the Mile High City of Denver, Colorado. </p>

 MY INSPIRATION: 
 


 The Day the EmPack was created, as featured on Refinery29. 
The light bulb for the EMPACK came to me when I was at the CrossFit Games watching my girlfriend compete. I was stuck in a hotel with absolutely no gym, and I was desperate to workout. I didn't just want to do typical bodyweight movements, like air squats and burpees. I wanted to lift! So, I took a suitcase, stuffed it with everything remotely heavy in the hotel room, and I lifted. It was tough, I was sore, and it made me realize that I needed to create something that not only would allow for amazing, effective workouts wherever you were, but could help my clients easily increase weight as they got stronger without spending a fortune on equipment!
Never thought I would say this, but that pocket size is more convenient than my fannypack.
THE WEIGHT 
My double sealed water bladders are extremely durable yet take no room in your EMPACK when not in use. Keep them filled and in your car ready to go. Keep them filled and in your own gym. Empty them, travel, and fill as needed! Hike up a mountain or sprint up the stairs with the added weight, but save your knees for when you come back down! 
AS YOU GET STRONGER, YOU JUST ADD MORE WATER.
Each bladder holds 15 pounds of unstable weight, and the Pack holds 4 bladders total. This unstable weight that is shifting with you as you move makes the weight not only more challenging, but more effective. 
MADE FOR EVERY LIFESTYLE
The EMPACK was created to make working out seamless no matter where you go. From business trips to mountain hikes, it provides the flexibility and durability to go where life takes you.
DESIGN
This weight training pack was born out of the need for everyday people to get an everyday workout without all the equipment. Fit, form and function was key in its design. It fits smoothly to all body styles. The form is modern and stylish, and the function is flexible to meet your training needs. Its military-grade durability allows it to stand up to the toughest workouts and the harshest weather. The EMPACK was also designed with the versatility to go on the road, be kept in your car, or used at home.
PRODUCTION
Through lots of trial and error, time and money the EMPACK will be U.S. made in the Mile High City of Denver, Colorado.

A SINCERE THANK YOU
I truly appreciate everyone taking the time to support my EMPACK project! This has been a dream of mine for over a year, and I am thrilled at the opportunity to bring this idea to LIFE! 
Please help me spread the word to your friends and loved ones!

</div></div>","THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO CONTRIBUTED, SPREAD THE WORD AND GAVE THEIR SUPPORT TO OUR CAMPAIGN! WE ARE SO...SO GRATEFUL!  INLAND is THIS Weekend! We hope to see you @ 99 SUDBURY on Saturday 11-6 or Sunday 11-5 for our first retail event.  More details here www.madeinland.ca! Help us create an event to support made-in-Canada fashion design! Did you know that the number of people employed in the Canadian apparel manufacturing industry has declined by 7O% in the last decade!? (Stats. Canada) We were shocked too! The good news is, there is a HUGE, growing community of independent clothing and accessory designers who either hand-make or manufacture their collections right here in Canada. It's likely you didn't know this either. Our goal is to provide a retail event for these incredible, high-quality designers so they can increase sales, build their business and contribute to reviving the local apparel industry. We've called this shopping event INLAND.  

INLAND is a 2-day, curated shopping marketplace featuring 80 independent designers of clothing and accessories for men + women, all made-in-Canada. Designers will set up their mini ""boutiques"" at 99 Sudbury Street, a 10,000 sq.ft. brick & beam space divided into 2 elegant rooms (The Gallery + The Glass Factory), to form a stylish, multi-brand ""pop-up"" like no other in Canada. By providing affordable, short-term retail space, INLAND gives emerging and established designers the opportunity to extend their reach beyond wholesale and online. They will meet and sell directly to customers (with NO commissions taken), connect with other designers and entrepreneurs while pooling their networks and clientele. See the full INLAND 2014 Designer Line-Up HERE and click on the ""Gallery"" tab above for images. You love great design and want to support Canada's arts and design community. You appreciate fine quality and ethical production practices. You support the local economy through small business and you take pride in the uniqueness of your personal style, right?  So do we! To honour this, we've carefully selected designers based on 
originality, aesthetic, quality and design sensibility. At INLAND, you will meet the designers of the clothes you buy! By contributing to his campaign, you will help build an exciting new platform to buy Canadian made, 
independent fashion!Here's what you can do to help...                                               #madeincanada #madeinland

<h2><strong><span style=""color: #ff7f00;"">The problem<br/></span></strong></h2>
<p>Just imagine you are walking with a stroller down a steep road and suddenly you stumble. Such scenarios are possible and therefore you might have read headlines such as:</p>

</ul><p> I am a proud father for three years now. While walking with my son sitting in his stroller I asked myself sometimes: <strong>“What happens if I the stroller wanders off?”</strong></p>
<p lang=""en-GB"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">I did some research and looked for a system that brings my stroller to a halt automatically. There are only a handful of mechanical solutions. Most systems work by pulling a lever while waling with the stroller. None of those seemed to be really comfortable.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" lang=""en-GB"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">So I decided to <strong>build my own break. </strong><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Unfortunately this task was way harder than I imagined.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span style=""color: #ff7f00;"">This was more than a year ago</span></strong></h2>
<p lang=""en-GB"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Since then a lot of things happened. In cooperation with a commercial academy and a technical school I started a project in the form of a dissertation. I was supervising the technical part and we build the first prototype.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""color: #ff7f00;"">The solution<br/></span></strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span lang=""en-GB"">Our system works contact-less. Sensors detect if the strollers is handled by a person or not. As long as the stroller is idle the breaks are closed. When the user puts his hands on the handle the systems unblocks the tires. Furthermore for safety reasons the whole system can also be controlled manually. For example when the battery is empty.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">The product will be available in two versions:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">
<span style=""color: #ff7f00;""><strong>Cabella<br/></strong></span><span lang=""en-GB"">This type is only for strollers that have an integrated hand brake. The retail price will be € 120.-</span>
</li>

<ul>
<li class=""western"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">
<span style=""color: #ff7f00;""><strong>Cabella pro<br/></strong></span><span lang=""en-GB"">This version can be installed on any stroller. The retail price will be € 150.-</span>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">After for years we are planning to build brakes for similar products such as wheel chairs.</p>
<div>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">The functional principle works! Right now we are working on a better mechanical construction and we are improving the electronic components. The version right know will be ready for a pilot batch soon.</p>

The problem
Just imagine you are walking with a stroller down a steep road and suddenly you stumble. Such scenarios are possible and therefore you might have read headlines such as:


Stroller rolling into a rover (Davos 24.06.2012)

Storm hits stroller (Hannover 04.01.2012)

Stroller rolls in front of a train (15.10.2009)
 I am a proud father for three years now. While walking with my son sitting in his stroller I asked myself sometimes: “What happens if I the stroller wanders off?”
I did some research and looked for a system that brings my stroller to a halt automatically. There are only a handful of mechanical solutions. Most systems work by pulling a lever while waling with the stroller. None of those seemed to be really comfortable.
So I decided to build my own break. Unfortunately this task was way harder than I imagined.
This was more than a year ago
Since then a lot of things happened. In cooperation with a commercial academy and a technical school I started a project in the form of a dissertation. I was supervising the technical part and we build the first prototype.
The solution
Our system works contact-less. Sensors detect if the strollers is handled by a person or not. As long as the stroller is idle the breaks are closed. When the user puts his hands on the handle the systems unblocks the tires. Furthermore for safety reasons the whole system can also be controlled manually. For example when the battery is empty.
The product will be available in two versions:


CabellaThis type is only for strollers that have an integrated hand brake. The retail price will be € 120.-




Cabella proThis version can be installed on any stroller. The retail price will be € 150.-


After for years we are planning to build brakes for similar products such as wheel chairs.


 
The project status

The functional principle works! Right now we are working on a better mechanical construction and we are improving the electronic components. The version right know will be ready for a pilot batch soon.
The business plan is almost finished and we are looking for partners and financing options.
What wee need


We are techiesWe can solve technical problems. However we also need are partners for sales and marketing. Professionals are necessary.
 


As always, we need moneyUntil now everything was self-financed but this is not possible any more. The effort would be too big.


On what will the money be used for
This money will be used to build the second prototype. This one should include all functions of the final product. Therefore the design has to be reworked. Since this is a prototype every component will be hand made:


adapting the electronics to SMD-technology € 1.000,-


reworking the design € 2.000,-

manufacturing the casing € 200,-

manufacturing the casing € 100,-

assemble the electrical components including the board € 1.500,-

miscellaneous € 200,-

What we offer
We are very thankful for any support and would like the give you some of our perks.
If you want to partner with us you can either be:

a full partner (€ 20.000 and above)
a dormant partner (€ 10.000 and above)

How can you help aus

Future plans
Our goal is to start a business in the beginning of 2013. We want to refine our product all the way to mass production. In summer 2013 we want to start selling our product.
The production will we situated in Austria.

 
 
Die Ausgangssituation
Oder stellen Sie sich vor, Sie schieben Ihren Kinderwagen auf einer steilen Straße und stürzen. Solche Gedanken sind nicht unrealistisch. Des öfteren liest man Schlagzeilen wie:


Kinderwagen stürzt in Bach (Davos 24.06.2012)


Sturmböe erfasst Kinderwagen (Hannover 04.01.2012)


Kinderwagen rollt vor Zug (15.10.2009)

Ich bin seit drei Jahren stolzer Vater. Beim Spazieren mit dem Kinderwagen stellte sich mir des öfteren die Frage: ""Was passiert, wenn mir der Kinderwagen auskommt?""
Ich recherchierte nach Sicherheitssystemen, die einen Kinderwagen von selbst zum Stillstand bringen. Es gab dazu nur einige wenig praktikable mechanische Lösungen, bei denen man die ganzen Zeit einen Hebel festhalten muß. Leider war in meinen Augen keine einzige der gefundenen Anwendungen bedienerfreundlich.
Also sagte ich mir: ""Dann baue ich mir eben selbst eines"". Leider war es nicht ganz so einfach, wie ich dachte.
Das war vor mehr als einem Jahr.
Seitdem geschah einiges. Das entwickelte Funktionsprinzip wurde umgesetzt. An einer Handelsakademie (an der ich ebenfalls unterrichte) wurde in einer Diplomarbeit eine Markterhebung gemacht. Ich selbst betreute an meiner Schule eine Diplomarbeit bei der ein Prototyp hergestellt wurde.
Das Problem
Das Problem ist, dass Personen die einen Kinderwagen schieben, des öfteren abgelenkt werden. In dieser Zeit kann sich der Kinderwagen unbeabsichtigt in Bewegung setzen. Um dies zu verhindern, gibt es Sperrbremsen, die jedoch gezielt (meist per Fußwippe) eingelegt werden müssen. Wird man abgelenkt, so vergisst man, diese einzulegen.
Weiters kann es passieren, dass man stolpert. Auch hier ist meist keine Zeit mehr, um die Bremse einzulegen.
Die Lösung
Unser Konzept (die Kinderwagensicherheitsbremse) reagiert berührungslos. Die Steuerung reagiert auf Sensoren, welche erkennen, ob das Fahrzeug von einer Bedienperson geschoben, gebremst oder in gleichmäßiger Bewegung gehalten wird. Im Ruhezustand hält das System die Bremsen im gesperrten Zustand. Sobald der Bediener das Fahrzeug an den Haltegriffen berührt, werden die Bremsen gelöst. Zusätzlich ist noch eine manuelle Bedienung des Bremssystems möglich.
Das Produkt soll in zwei Varianten vertrieben werden:


CabellaDas Produkt zur Integration in eine vorhandene Seilzugbremse. Der Endkundenpreis ist mit € 120,- Brutto geplant.
 



Cabella proDas Folgeprodukt für Kinderwägen die keine Seilzugbremse eingebaut haben. Es wird hier ein Endkundenpreis € 150,- Brutto geplant.

 
Eine Diversifikation auf verwandte Bereiche (z.B. Rollstühle) ist ab dem fünften Jahr geplant.
 


 
Der Projektstand

Das Funktionsprinzip ist umgesetzt und getestet. Aktuell wird an einer neuen mechanischen Konstruktion und an der Überarbeitung der Steuerplatine gearbeitet. Das Modul wird in Richtung Vorserienreife weiterentwickelt.
Der Businessplan ist im Endstadium und es wurde mit der Suche nach Partnern und Förderungs- u. Finanzierungsmöglichkeiten begonnen.

It’s an integration of upcycled leather and vegan leather making it a sustainable alternative to traditional leather. Prime Fiber Leather utilizes existing materials rather than killing new animals, requires very minimal processing which keeps material out of landfills. Plus, it’s lighter and stronger than traditional leather, waterproof and scratch-resistant!This incredible material is certified by GRS (Global Recycled Standard), an international, voluntary, full product standard that sets requirements for third-party certification of recycled content, chain of custody, social and environmental practices, and chemical restrictions. The GRS's objective is to define requirements to ensure accurate content claims and right working conditions, so the harmful impact on environments is minimized. Stay cool, comfortable and feeling fresh with our patented Soufflé Fit Technology™. There was no fabric for the lining material that we could find on the current market that was up to our standard of comfort level, so we developed our own special Soufflé Fit Technology™ to produce a fabric that is extremely soft, breathable, and moisture-wicking. The lining and sock material are made of a unique blend of Merino Wool and an all-natural, renewable fiber mixed with Tencel fabric from sustainably harvested forestry. This fabric is also antimicrobial and odor-eliminating so socks are always optional. Are you ready for all-day comfort? The midsole and rubber outsole of the shoes are made with Popcorn Technology ™, our unique dual-density technology that’s ultra-flexible and molds to your every move. We named this Popcorn Technology™ because it features excellent shock absorption and adds durability and traction to the shoe. Unlike the average rubber outsole of a classic sneaker, Scooter One's high-elastic EVA pad targets two main pressure points on the soles. This conforms and adds cushion to your entire foot for lasting comfort throughout the day. It is a revolutionary cushioning technology that is super lightweight, which provides the highest energy return when you are running or walking. Say “goodbye” to tired feet!  Scooter One Shoes are good for you and good for the planet.   We use 100% eco-friendly pigments to create that bright, shiny exterior. We don’t use any harmful dyes or chemicals. The leather coating of Prime Fiber Leather is free of DMF’s (dimethyl formaldehyde), a substance that can occur in liver damage if absorbed by the skin.   Our laces are made of 100% cotton, and the soles are a mix of 90% natural rubber and 10% recycled rubber. We guarantee that the entirety of Scooter One Shoes is made with harmless and sustainable materials. Our shoe box is made with 100% recyclable cardboard that is sustainable. It has a double layer protection that is sturdy enough to hold Scooter Ones in place so that no additional packaging is needed.Disclaimer: Due to the pandemic and the holiday supply chain surges,the current estimated shipping date is 1/15/2021Still unsure about your size?

<b>Many-maker solves this problem</b> by enabling you to make injection moulded production runs in record time, right on your desktop using inexpensive mould tools cast in high temperature polymers from mould masters made with your 3D printer.<br/><br/><p>Many-Maker is the ultimate 3D printer  accessory as it can reproduce your prints without days worth of printing, hand finishing or

<p>Each press comes with everything you need to get started. </p>
<p><b>Many-Maker- Large Pro Model -</b> This is the more capable professional
    automatic production press.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Key features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Style -</b> Professional desktop appliance footprint and appearance,
      similar to a microwave oven.</li>
<li>
<b>Large tool cavity size -</b> 150 mm x 80 mm x 36 mm</li>
<li>
<b>Mould tools -</b> includes both a small mould tool kit and a large mould
      tool kit, to fit the compact dual servo 8 tonne toggle clamp.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Ventilation Control -</b> The PRO model case design is such that the
      press draws in fresh air from the ejection cavity and blows all exhaust flumes out
      a single port fitted with a fan and ducting. A properly duct-ed Many-maker will
      expose you to less fumes in one hundred prints than your 3D printer will in just
      one.</li>
<li>
<b>Noise Control -</b> The pro model enclosure is lined with a Mass
      Loaded Vinyl sound barrier keeping the sound level to about 60 dBA, comparable to
      the sound level of an air conditioner.</li>
<li>
<b>Supplied with</b>  0.9 kg silicone moulding material and 1kg epoxy
      moulding material (enough for about 8 to 12 small mould tools) and 4 kg ABS white
      plastic.</li>
</ul>This model is suitable for regular production runs or moulding larger parts in a
    professional environment.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<p><b>Many-Maker Large Automatic model -</b></p>
<p>To keep the Large Automatic model as affordable as possible we have stripped down
    the Pro model to a bare bones large maker machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>no enclosure / cosmetic covers - Bare bones -</li>
<li>No ventilation control - needs to be used in a well ventilated area.</li>
<li>No noise control - the maximum sound level is about 72dBA - a little louder
      than a dishwasher.</li>
</ul>
<p>This model is suitable for regular production runs of larger parts in an maker
    environment, where higher noise levels and ventilation is not an issue</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><b>Many-Maker Automatic model -</b></p>
<p>To keep the automatic model as affordable as possible we have scaled down the
    Large Automatic model to a smaller maker machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>small tool only</li>
<li>smaller servo motors</li>
<li>smaller, single servo inline automatic 4 tonne clamp</li>
<li>smaller power supply and drive circuits</li>
</ul>
<p>This model is suitable for regular production runs of smaller parts in an maker
    environment, where higher noise levels and ventilation is not an issue, and space is
    not at a premium.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Many-Maker - Manual Model -</b>  To make this lowest cost model, we have
    scaled down the maker model even further:</p>
<ul>
<li>no Automatic hopper - You measure and feed the pellets manually.</li>
<li>no Automatic clamp - The tool is opened manually.</li>
<li>no Ejector or Ejector pins - The part is removed manually.</li>
<li>only 0.9 kg silicone moulding material and 2 kg ABS white plastic.</li>
</ul>
<p>This model is suitable for education, experimentation, prototyping, or occasional
     small production runs of smaller parts.</p>
<p><br/>
<b>Common Features</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Shot size -</b> 28 cc or 21 gram ( 3/4 oz) ABS.</li>
<li>
<b>Production Rate -</b> can process 210 gram of raw material in 1 hour
      .</li>
<li>
<b>Cycle time -</b> 10 Shots per hour at 21 gram and a single shot can
      consist of multiple small parts. Up to 40 Shots per hour at less than 10.5 grams
      per shot.</li>
<li>
<b>Small tool cavity size -</b> 80 mm x 50 mm x 36 mm (all models )</li>
<li>
<b>Daylight -</b> 160 mm</li>
<li>
<b>PID automation and control -</b> Full electronic feedback and control
      of all system functions.</li>
<li>
<b>All electronic - </b>Clean and silent operation using servo actuators,
      not hydraulic actuators.</li>
<li>
<b>All Stainless steel</b> construction for life long reliable operation
      in the harshest environments.</li>
<li>
<b>Expected serviceable life -</b> more than 50 000 production

<p><b>Optional plasticizing screw attachment -</b>Many-Maker uses a piston and barrel
    to melt and build pressure so you have to use pre-colored plastic which come in a
    wide but limited color range. The optional plasticizing screw attachment allows you
    to use uncolored plastic and color master-batches to achieve an unlimited uniform
    color range.</p>
<p><b>Tool making materials</b> After extensive testing, the best starter material
    was found to be <a href=""http://www.smooth-on.com/a59/Mold-Max%3D-60-Higher-Heat-Resistant-Silicone/article_info.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MoldMax 60</a>. It is hard enough withstand the pressure for
    simple mounds and soft enough to make casting easy  and sets in a few hours. It
    is very forgiving of errors in draft so is great for making characters and irregular
    shapes.<br/></p>
<p>For more precise and mechanical parts we supply a easy to cast but hard aluminium
    filled 2 part polyurethane resin. Remember the harder the casting material, the less
    forgiving it will be on draft errors.</p>
<p>Once you have the basics down, you can move onto harder and  stronger
    materials such as resins. Harder materials are great for
    more precise mechanical parts.</p>
<p>A wide range of casting materials can be used as long as they have limited
    shrinkage, their ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore_durometer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">shoreA hardness</a>"" is 60 or more and their  <a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thermalconductivity</a> is below 5 <i>W/(m K)</i>. The exposure
    to high temperature is only for a very short duration so you can use just about any
    non thermo-forming plastic, especially if you can fill it with aluminium powder.</p>
<p>For CNC-able high precision moulds, you can use PTFE which has excellent
    machine-ability or PEEK which has a hardness and strength  to rival
    aluminium.</p>
<p>CNC'ed aluminium and steel can also be used on small parts.</p>
<p>In time, the Many-Maker community and wiki  will gain insight and practical
    advice on how to use a variety of materials.</p>

<b>Lowest unit cost</b> - Compared to 3D printing Many-maker uses industrial pellets which cost less than 1/8th the price of filament. Further cost savings add up in supervision labor, machine printing time and finishing labor. Compared to industrial injection moulding, when the tooling costs, short run premiums and opportunity costs of long lead times are taken into account the total cost of production on a Many-maker is lower than industrial scale injection moulding for small to medium production runs.

<details><br/><p><b>Competitive Benefits</b></p>
<p>The benefits of the Many-Maker press compared to small bench drill style manual injection presses:</p>
<p><b>Automation -</b> Many-maker is automated, it can produce your parts while you sleep. Bench drill style presses are only manual, they need your full attention.</p>
<p><b>Labor saving and scale-able </b>- a bench style press requires a dedicated person to operate just one press, with a Many-maker a single person can put an army of presses to work to create a really fast production line, and still do other work.</p>
<p><b>Process control -</b> Many-maker's injection process is automated giving fine repeated control over the quality, Bench drill style presses are totally manual resulting in human scale variation in the process and quality.</p>
<p><b>Desktop appliance style - </b>Many-maker pro sits neatly next to your printer, it looks and performs more like an appliance than a workshop machine.</p>
<p><b>One part molding -</b> The unique split mould casting system make creating your mould tool a simple, cheap desktop operation.</p>
<p><b>Master batch color mixing -</b> With the plasticizing screw attachment you can uniformly mix your own colors from master batches.</p>

As this is still a prototype the servos are manually controlled. The motors are pushed to their limit, until they stall. I have busted quite a few motor bearings under manual control.

<b style=""background-color: initial;"">More use cases ...</b>
<details><p></p>
<div>
<b>Custom electronic enclosure and buttons,</b><p>Over the years I have had lots of ideas for electronic gadgets. Only one thing has stopped me from pursuing them, ""darn that would require a custom case, I have the budget for the electronics but not the kind of cash you need for a cool case and buttons"", or my features will beat the imported types if only it looked better than the plain hobby boxes and buttons. With Many-Maker there is no more such limitations I can produce by own fancy enclosures and buttons.<br/><b><br/>Crowdfunded robot - </b>A complex creation like a robot can be made up of  hundreds of custom parts, each requiring a metal injection moulding tool, and each tool will cost a couple thousand dollars , thus injection molding such a complex creation could easily cost a few hundred thousand dollars in tooling alone.  A crowdfunded project would need to sell tens of thousands of robots to be successful. What if you only sell 500? When <a href=""http://bcove.me/blf89jtb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">using 3D printed tools on an industrial machine</a> the unit cost is high because they require a slow production cycle on an expensive industrial machine. Professionally 3D printing all the parts will be to costly, printing them yourself will take to long. The answer is to only 3D print a few of the larger or more complex parts, and the rest a team of Many-maker presses can easily deliver in under a month, all for less than what a single industrial tool could cost, and a lot faster too. Many-maker makes this a viable project.</p>
<br/><p><b><br/>Self published games - </b>You may have a great idea for a cool board game with unique characters. Printing cards and boards are not so expensive but if you wanted your own 3D characters, dice and paraphernalia you were in for big bucks, but now with a Many-Maker you can make your game a reality.</p>
<br/><b>Mobile case - </b>Getting a new mobile phone model case on the shelf before importers can land the new models can give you a first mover advantage. 3D printing a case will cost about $8 however the retail price for cases are around $6, leaving no margin for profit. By using Many-maker your material cost is well under 10c, the machine time and non recurring engineering costs are negligible, and time to market is hours. Many-maker makes this a viable project.<br/><br/><b>3D printing service industry (</b>3D hubs)- If you are already offering 3D printing as a service, you will know how many prototypes you print for aspiring inventors, you will also realize how few of these actually end up being commercially produced. Offering desktop injection molding as a service to your customers will increase your potential revenue and ensure you have happy repeat customers. There will be a gold rush period where you can make high margins and good money from desktop injection moulding, as it becomes more popular the margins will drop, so make sure you establish your reputation before anyone else.</div>

<p>Your ability to
produce a quality injection moulded part will be highly dependent on
the quality of the moulding tool you create, which in turn is
dependent on the manufacturing technology. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>3D Printers with
good surface finish ( DLP,  SLA, SLS, Polly Jet) </b>
are
the best solution and can easily
produce both hard silicone
and Epoxy tools.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>FDM Printers</b>
are suitable for easily
producing hard
silicone moulds. Producing
Epoxy tools from FDM printed
mould masters requires a lot
of surface finishing which can be difficult to achieve with fine
detail or dimensional accuracy.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Hard Silicone
</b><b>Tools</b> are suitable for parts with slight overhangs that do
not require dimensional perfection such as artistic pieces. Silicone
is very forgiving of poor surface finishing so is the best option for
FDM printed mould masters. [Images]</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Epoxy Tools</b> are suitable for parts with no overhangs, good
draft and smooth surfaces, they can produce dimensional stable and
accurate parts. Best for hi resolution printers. Can be used with
very well finished FDM printed mould masters without fine detail. 
[Images]</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Laser cut l</b><b>ayered
tools </b>are suitable for producing mechanically accurate and
functional parts such as gears. Layers can be laser cut Plywood,
aluminium or stainless steel sheets.  [Images]</p>

<p>
<b>Many-maker
sounds under priced, are you sure you are able to deliver at such a
low price?</b></p>
<p>
The
pricing has been carefully worked out at 2.6 x the material cost and
labour
(less Indiegogo and early bird discounts) which is in line with the
recommendations of <a href=""http://blog.ponoko.com/2010/11/16/ten-rules-for-maker-businesses-by-wireds-chris-anderson-%E2%80%94-rule-1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ten
rules for maker businesses (2.6 x multiplier)</a>.
We keep costs down as follow: 1) No middle man taking a significant
cut means we can offer an Indiegogo and early bird discount, 2)
Clever practical design, 3) Using Laser cut mechanical parts instead
of CNC'ed machined parts, 4) Using Desktop Injection Moulded parts
wherever possible, 6) Using COTS (Common of the shelf parts) as much
as possible, 7) Re-purposing mechanical sub-assemblies from mass
produced automotive products and 8) The key mechanics comes fully
assembled and tested but the cosmetics comes in kit form, this saves
both labor and shipping.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Where
do I buy after market materials?</b></p>
<p>
Either
from Many-Maker as a kit or from independent sources. The molding
compound is widely available, and online from smooth-on (<a href=""http://www.smooth-on.com/a59/Mold-Max%3D-60-Higher-Heat-Resistant-Silicone/article_info.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mold
Max 60</a>).
Raw plastic is available from sellers locally wherever there is
industrial injection moulding industries, usually in 25KG bags at
under $2 per kg. - one bag will last you a long time. We are going to
build a database of regional suppliers and suitable casting and
plastic materials.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<br/><b>Is
it difficult to use?</b></p>
<p>
You
love 3D printing because you like challenges, you like learning new
things, so yes there is a lot to learn, it is a wonderful experience
to learn to make and produce your own creations, but it is not easy.
You will have some failed attempts before you start winning.</p>
<p>
<br/><b>Where

<p>
<b>How
would you compare industrial injection moulding with desktop
injection moulding?</b></p>
<p>
When
desktop publishing emerged in the late 80's it was not compared to
industrial printing presses, in the same way it would be wrong to
compare the injection moulding machines as they are vastly different.
An industrial professional can look at desktop injection moulding as
say that it is so limiting, a maker, inventor or entrepreneur can
look at the same machine and say it is so liberating. Its performance
is totally subjective.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>What
about technical support?</b></p>
<p>
In
addition to the online video tutorials, I will also have direct
online support. I hope to establish an online community around
desktop injection moulding to expand and share knowledge and
experiences.</p>
<p>
Faulty
parts and spares will have to be ordered online, having said that the
machine is very robust so I expect most issues to be user related, or
mould making related.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>I
run a 3D printing service, can I offer injection moulding as an add
on?</b></p>
<p>
Yes,
This is a great business opportunity as the cost benefit of desktop
injection moulding is unparalleled for small production runs. I
expect initially there will be a gold rush period during which the
initial adopters will make high profit margins, followed by a plateau
and eventually nearly all 3D printing service providers will offer
low cost injection mould production.</p>
<p>
<br/><b>Can
I injection mould non 3D printed parts or crafts?</b></p>
<p>
Yes,
you can make suitable 2 part moulds from just about any object.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>I
have seen industrial injection moulding machines on auction for $1K
to $5K, why should I bother with desktop injection moulding?</b></p>
<p>
What
I want to achieve is to put a production machine for under $1000 in
the hands of makers, together with all the material, tools and
know-how in one box - a system to follow and learn from. It is not
about putting a single machine in a few hands, it is about putting a
new skill in lots of hands.</p>
<p>
However,
If you are lucky enough to find such a machine, and you can afford it
then you should buy it, but remember it takes up a lot of space, and
maintenance and repair is going to be at industrial machine prices
not auction prices, so best you make sure it is complete and in full
working condition.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Why
are you trying to minimize the role of 3D printing in democratized
manufacture?</b></p>
<p>
If
I reach my objective of widespread adoption of desktop injection
moulding then Many-Maker will be a 3D printing amplifier, and 3D
printing will become more influential in the market due to
Many-Maker's benefits. More makers will see a self defined path from
idea to market, and this self defined path is the driving inspiration
for many makers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>What
happens when my mould tool gets worn out in just a couple of hundred
shots?</b></p>
<p>
Just
make another tool (from the same 3D master print), it is quick and
quite cheap ($3 to $5) depending on size.</p>

<details style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>How
does Many-Maker fit the function of a big industrial machine into a
desktop press ?</b></p>
<p>
An
industrial machine is optimized for high speed production with many
cavities and fast cycle times, so it injects plastic melt with
between 800 psi and 12000 psi (big machines even higher), For an
industrial machine the typical cycle time is under 15 seconds and it
can accommodate a large tool that can make multiple (4x 8x 16x or
even 100x) small parts in one shot.</p>
<p>
Many-Maker
injects with between 600 psi and 3000 psi into the casted mould tool.
Many-maker has a cycle time of 300 seconds and it can accommodate a
tool about 1/8th to 1/4 the size of a typical small industrial
machine, and would typically make only one part at a time.</p>
<p>
High
pressure industrial machines can achieve long 0.5 mm and thinner
walls, with most walls being around 2 mm and runners at 3 mm
diameter. With a many-maker we have to compromise by using thicker
walls and runners. Many-Maker can still achieve high definition, just
not very long thin walls.</p>
<p>
<br/>Many-Maker
may be slow but it gets a small production run done quicker because
there are no delays in waiting for metal tooling, or queuing for a
production run.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>I
know you need metal tools to withstand the pressure from injection
moulding, how can you do it with silicone rubber?</b></p>
<p>
Firstly
we are limited to smaller tools and parts, that reduces the pressure
requirement. Secondly, because silicone has a 50x lower thermal
conductivity than steel <a href=""https://www.uwplatt.edu/files/plastics/Focus%20On%20Energy.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">we
don't need to re-heat the melt in the mould tool, using
sheer-thinning pressure and gates techniques</a>,
thus the pressure requirement is much lower.</p>
<p>
Compared
to metal, Shore 60A silicone is very soft, but because it is quite
dense, when you compress it in a small metal enclosure, it is
surprisingly resistant. The plastic will flow where there is least
resistance so we have built in overflow routes so back pressure is
limited, and when the pressure subsides from the initial injection,
the silicone pushes back and keeps its form reasonably and
predictably well - ideal for characters, <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meeple"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Meeples</a> and
irregular shapes. For precision mechanical parts the use of hard
resin cast moulds or CNC'ed metal moulds are recommended. Alas there
will be some features that is possible with metal tooling that will
require compromises and workarounds with polymer tooling.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>What
is the largest part I can make?</b></p>
<p>
The
largest mould cavity for the PRO model is 150 mm x 90 mm x 36 mm,
However the largest part will depend on the length and thickness of
the runners and walls, and the compromises you make. If the part you
need is larger you can still make it by bonding, welding or riviting
multiple small parts together.</p>
<p>
<b><br/>A
28 cc or 21 gram shot seems tiny and useless, why did you make it so
small?</b></p>
<p>
The
shot size compares well to other small machines like <a href=""http://www.injectionmolder.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this</a> or <a href=""http://www.morganindustriesinc.com/why-morgan-press.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this</a>,
which cost much more than what Many-maker costs. A 28 cc (0.7 oz)
shot size is a lot larger than what you may think, so it far from
useless, there are plenty of applications where 28 cc is ample. A
final product could be made of multiple parts, some produced by
Many-maker, some professionally 3D printed, and some even laser cut
from steel, acrylic or wood. Many-maker is part of the ecosystem, you
will find ways to to create your product. The size is limited by the
budget for the servo's and toggle clamp.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Can
I injection mould everything or anything I printed?</b></p>
<p>
No,
you have to Design For Manufacture ( DFM ), this means you have to
follow similar constraints to full industrial injection moulding,
else your part will remain stuck in the mould! 3D printing is capable
of producing objects that injection moulding could never reproduce,
so you have to work within the limits of the technology.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>What
types of plastics can be used?</b></p>
<p>
A
well designed mould tool cast in Moldmax 60 and pressed in ABS will
give you a mould tool life of about 500 shots, but just about any
plastic with a melt temperature between 150'C and 290'C can be used.
Higher temperature plastics, filled plastics like carbon fiber and
highly corrosive plastics will reduce the the mould tool life. The
good thing is if your tool gets worn out, just make another, it is
quick and quite cheap.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Can
I modify my own machine?</b></p>
<p>
The
software will be open sourced so makers can modify their own
machines, it is super simple, main thing is to control the heating
profile for different materials - it is nothing like the complexity
of 3D printing, it is simple process control.</p>
<p>
<br/><b>Why
is the clamp so much bigger than the injector? / Why is the more
capable PRO model, smaller than the Automatic model?</b></p>
<p>
It
is the norm in injection moulding for the toggle clamp to be bigger
and stronger than the injector, this is to counter the force due to
the leverage of the large surface area of the mould (<a href=""https://youtu.be/g6AZsIxpi5I?t=41"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">like
this effect</a>).
The Automatic model is designed for reduced cost so a single inline
actuator is aligned dead center with the spru, this makes the machine
a lot longer than the desktop version, which uses 2 actuators in a C
toggle clamp arrangement, which requires more steel but delivers more
clamping and results in a optimal use of space.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<br/><b>Can
I use CNC'ed aluminum moulding tools or tools printed from steel or
ceramics?</b></p>
<p>
CNC'ed
PEEK or PTFE is a better option for high endurance, high precision
moulds that would work perfectly in a many-maker.</p>
<p>
Ceramics
should work very well.</p>
<p>
Yes,
metal moulds can be used but the maximum size may be smaller than
what can be achieved with PEEK or PTFE.</p>

<details style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">
<p>
<b>Do
I need a special printer or to print in any special material?</b></p>
<p>
No,
you can print a mould master in any material using any 3D printer
technology, the magic happens when you cast the mould master into a
mould tool. However the surface quality of the print your printer produces will affect what you can produce.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Can
I print the mould directly?</b></p>
<p>
To
print a mould directly you will require a thermosetting mould
material, that means you need a STL or SLS printer. I think the
possibilities are endless and this is probably going to be the best
method of producing mould tools for desktop injection moulding.</p>
<p>
<b><br/>Do
I need special software?</b></p>
<p>
No,
you can use the same software you use to run your current 3D jobs. I
plan to have mould templates available for the most common 3D
software. Even if you use something different, the mould templates
are quite simple geometric shapes that you can recreate easily in
your software.

Every maker, inventor and engineer  knows that 3D printing is great for making prototypes, but after the prototype is made, you struggle to commercialize those prototypes because 3D printing is too slow and costly for production runs, and the long lead time, high cost and risk of the injection moulding tools prevents quick and easy access to industrial injection moulding processes.
Many-maker solves this problem by enabling you to make injection moulded production runs in record time, right on your desktop using inexpensive mould tools cast in high temperature polymers from mould masters made with your 3D printer.Many-Maker is the ultimate 3D printer  accessory as it can reproduce your prints without days worth of printing, hand finishing or 
expensive filament.


The Many-maker automatic model in operation.




Step 1 - DFM - Design your part for manufacture (DFM), print out your prototypes and test them, once you are happy with your part then ... (ref: Basics and general info) (more about draft)


Step 2 - Prepare the master print - In your CAD package split your part on the ""hairline"" and attach the 2 parts to the moulding template provided, adjust sprue, gates, runners, vents and ejection pins as needed, then 3D print the two mould master tools.



Step 3 - Refine the mould master 3D prints - Depending on you printer and materials refine your print to the quality you want from your copies.

Step 4 - Cast the mould tool -  Insert the 2 part half's into the unique Many-maker 1 step rapid casting mould tool base, Mix and inject the moulding compound into the tools, let set, remove and clean.



Step 5 - Setup the injection mould press and run - Attach the mould half's to the press, set the material, quantity and volume of the part, fill the hopper and press start, your Many-Maker will automatically produce the number of copies you require while you sleep.





Each machine comes with everything you need to get started. 




Optional color mixing screw attachment - The optional color mixing screw attachment allows you to mix any color or use color master-batches to achieve an unlimited uniform color range.

Many-Maker- Large Pro Model - This is the more capable professional
    automatic production press.
Key features:


Style - Professional desktop appliance footprint and appearance,
      similar to a microwave oven.

Large tool cavity size - 150 mm x 80 mm x 36 mm

Mould tools - includes both a small mould tool kit and a large mould
      tool kit, to fit the compact dual servo 8 tonne toggle clamp.


Ventilation Control - The PRO model case design is such that the
      press draws in fresh air from the ejection cavity and blows all exhaust flumes out
      a single port fitted with a fan and ducting. A properly duct-ed Many-maker will
      expose you to less fumes in one hundred prints than your 3D printer will in just
      one.

Noise Control - The pro model enclosure is lined with a Mass
      Loaded Vinyl sound barrier keeping the sound level to about 60 dBA, comparable to
      the sound level of an air conditioner.

Supplied with  0.9 kg silicone moulding material and 1kg epoxy
      moulding material (enough for about 8 to 12 small mould tools) and 4 kg ABS white
      plastic.
This model is suitable for regular production runs or moulding larger parts in a
    professional environment.

Many-Maker Large Automatic model -
To keep the Large Automatic model as affordable as possible we have stripped down
    the Pro model to a bare bones large maker machine:

no enclosure / cosmetic covers - Bare bones -
No ventilation control - needs to be used in a well ventilated area.
No noise control - the maximum sound level is about 72dBA - a little louder
      than a dishwasher.

This model is suitable for regular production runs of larger parts in an maker
    environment, where higher noise levels and ventilation is not an issue


Many-Maker Automatic model -
To keep the automatic model as affordable as possible we have scaled down the
    Large Automatic model to a smaller maker machine:

small tool only
smaller servo motors
smaller, single servo inline automatic 4 tonne clamp
smaller power supply and drive circuits

This model is suitable for regular production runs of smaller parts in an maker
    environment, where higher noise levels and ventilation is not an issue, and space is
    not at a premium.


Many-Maker - Manual Model -  To make this lowest cost model, we have
    scaled down the maker model even further:

no Automatic hopper - You measure and feed the pellets manually.
no Automatic clamp - The tool is opened manually.
no Ejector or Ejector pins - The part is removed manually.
only 0.9 kg silicone moulding material and 2 kg ABS white plastic.

This model is suitable for education, experimentation, prototyping, or occasional
     small production runs of smaller parts.

Optional plasticizing screw attachment -Many-Maker uses a piston and barrel
    to melt and build pressure so you have to use pre-colored plastic which come in a
    wide but limited color range. The optional plasticizing screw attachment allows you
    to use uncolored plastic and color master-batches to achieve an unlimited uniform
    color range.
Tool making materials After extensive testing, the best starter material
    was found to be MoldMax 60. It is hard enough withstand the pressure for
    simple mounds and soft enough to make casting easy  and sets in a few hours. It
    is very forgiving of errors in draft so is great for making characters and irregular
    shapes.
For more precise and mechanical parts we supply a easy to cast but hard aluminium
    filled 2 part polyurethane resin. Remember the harder the casting material, the less
    forgiving it will be on draft errors.
Once you have the basics down, you can move onto harder and  stronger
    materials such as resins. Harder materials are great for
    more precise mechanical parts.
A wide range of casting materials can be used as long as they have limited
    shrinkage, their ""shoreA hardness"" is 60 or more and their  thermalconductivity is below 5 W/(m K). The exposure
    to high temperature is only for a very short duration so you can use just about any
    non thermo-forming plastic, especially if you can fill it with aluminium powder.
For CNC-able high precision moulds, you can use PTFE which has excellent
    machine-ability or PEEK which has a hardness and strength  to rival
    aluminium.
CNC'ed aluminium and steel can also be used on small parts.
In time, the Many-Maker community and wiki  will gain insight and practical
    advice on how to use a variety of materials.






The benefits of using a Desktop Injection Moulding Press as a 3D printer accessory are:









Convenience and automation - You can automatically produce hundreds of Injection moulded copies while you sleep, and they require much less post processing finishing than 3D printed parts.









Consistent Quality and Appearance  - Once the 3D master print 
has been refined with careful   post processing finishing, all future 
injection moulded copies will have the same finish










Speed - Not fast like an industrial machine, but lightning fast compared to 3D printing multiple copies - produce 1000++ copies in a week, and  it is practical to set up a Many-maker farm and achieve thousands of copies a day for much less than an industrial injection moulding tool. 
 







 Time to market - Many-Maker may be slow compared to industrial machines but it gets a small production run done quicker because it does not require metal tooling, there is no waiting in someone else's queue to get the job done, you do it right here, right now.








 Strong solid plastic -  Injection molded parts are a lot stronger than  printed parts, and as this study by Michael Rosplock   shows, there is ""no real (strength) benefit to annealing 3D printed parts"" . 









Known food safety -  3D printing and 3D printed parts have known and unknown toxicity issues ( 3D printing & food safety), whereas the safety of injection moulded materials are well established.








Inspirational -  Many-maker provides a self defined path from idea to market, and this self defined path is the driving inspiration for many makers.








Lowest unit cost - Compared to 3D printing Many-maker uses industrial pellets which cost less than 1/8th the price of filament. Further cost savings add up in supervision labor, machine printing time and finishing labor. Compared to industrial injection moulding, when the tooling costs, short run premiums and opportunity costs of long lead times are taken into account the total cost of production on a Many-maker is lower than industrial scale injection moulding for small to medium production runs.

Competitive Benefits
The benefits of the Many-Maker press compared to small bench drill style manual injection presses:
Automation - Many-maker is automated, it can produce your parts while you sleep. Bench drill style presses are only manual, they need your full attention.
Labor saving and scale-able - a bench style press requires a dedicated person to operate just one press, with a Many-maker a single person can put an army of presses to work to create a really fast production line, and still do other work.
Process control - Many-maker's injection process is automated giving fine repeated control over the quality, Bench drill style presses are totally manual resulting in human scale variation in the process and quality.
Desktop appliance style - Many-maker pro sits neatly next to your printer, it looks and performs more like an appliance than a workshop machine.
One part molding - The unique split mould casting system make creating your mould tool a simple, cheap desktop operation.
Master batch color mixing - With the plasticizing screw attachment you can uniformly mix your own colors from master batches.

This is a un-edited close-up video of the ejector of the prototype machine viewed from below as it produces 3 gears, the production machines will be about twice as fast. (click here to open full screen)




As this is still a prototype the servos are manually controlled. The motors are pushed to their limit, until they stall. I have busted quite a few motor bearings under manual control. The production unit's electronics and process control firmware will take care of the motors so you cannot overload them.A gear produced in the above video The gear is made from uncolored nylon which is semi-translucent so it shows up as slightly, discolored with speckles of black because the prototype still controlled manually, so it is easy to burn the plastic, and once there is burned residue in the barrel it takes a long time for it to purge. The production units will be fully controlled by the automation firmware so this will not happen.
A close up view of the edge of the gear:



According to How
Much Can You Print with a Single 1kg Spool it
took 14 days to print 392 chess pieces, Making and selling limited
edition themed chess sets (like a this
one )
could be quite a nice little business for creative makers, but not if
it takes more than a day to print just one set. Using Many-Maker one
set would take a little over an hour to produce.  





A Florida company, Origin Robotics is currently running a Indiegogo campaign for their Robot Hand called  ORIGIGRIP. One perk on offer is $59 for 6 printed parts and some bolts, nuts and other bits. Five of the printed parts could easily be reproduced with a Many-maker, thereby increasing the strength of the parts so they could be made smaller and lighter. Using a Many-maker would accelerate their manufacturing to enable wider distribution and most importantly reduce the cost..
Overall using a Many-maker would benefit the makers and consumers of the ORIGIGRIP.





More use cases ...


Custom electronic enclosure and buttons,Over the years I have had lots of ideas for electronic gadgets. Only one thing has stopped me from pursuing them, ""darn that would require a custom case, I have the budget for the electronics but not the kind of cash you need for a cool case and buttons"", or my features will beat the imported types if only it looked better than the plain hobby boxes and buttons. With Many-Maker there is no more such limitations I can produce by own fancy enclosures and buttons.Crowdfunded robot - A complex creation like a robot can be made up of  hundreds of custom parts, each requiring a metal injection moulding tool, and each tool will cost a couple thousand dollars , thus injection molding such a complex creation could easily cost a few hundred thousand dollars in tooling alone.  A crowdfunded project would need to sell tens of thousands of robots to be successful. What if you only sell 500? When using 3D printed tools on an industrial machine the unit cost is high because they require a slow production cycle on an expensive industrial machine. Professionally 3D printing all the parts will be to costly, printing them yourself will take to long. The answer is to only 3D print a few of the larger or more complex parts, and the rest a team of Many-maker presses can easily deliver in under a month, all for less than what a single industrial tool could cost, and a lot faster too. Many-maker makes this a viable project.
Self published games - You may have a great idea for a cool board game with unique characters. Printing cards and boards are not so expensive but if you wanted your own 3D characters, dice and paraphernalia you were in for big bucks, but now with a Many-Maker you can make your game a reality.
Mobile case - Getting a new mobile phone model case on the shelf before importers can land the new models can give you a first mover advantage. 3D printing a case will cost about $8 however the retail price for cases are around $6, leaving no margin for profit. By using Many-maker your material cost is well under 10c, the machine time and non recurring engineering costs are negligible, and time to market is hours. Many-maker makes this a viable project.3D printing service industry (3D hubs)- If you are already offering 3D printing as a service, you will know how many prototypes you print for aspiring inventors, you will also realize how few of these actually end up being commercially produced. Offering desktop injection molding as a service to your customers will increase your potential revenue and ensure you have happy repeat customers. There will be a gold rush period where you can make high margins and good money from desktop injection moulding, as it becomes more popular the margins will drop, so make sure you establish your reputation before anyone else.





All exposed hot surfaces are actively cooled by fans and are safe to touch. The head of the machine has a protective polycarbonate shield and the press will not move without this in place.   However Many-Maker is a power tool, not a consumer appliance, to avoid injury, the operator requires similar supervision or experience as for any other  power tool.








I have to stress, Many-Maker is not a consumer product, it is a machine I build for other makers like me, wanting to learn new skills and expand on their capabilities. If you want an appliance that going to ""cook"" your 3D prints for you the first time out the box, then Many-maker is not  for you. You will have many failed attempts at producing your own injection moulding parts before you start winning, but once you win you will have a valuable new tool and skill set.

You could profit from your new skills by offering Injection Moulding as a extra service on 3D hubs or similar. By being an early adopter you can differentiate yourself and establish your reputation before anyone else. There will be a gold rush period where you can make high margins and good money from the desktop injection moulding service industry.





Your ability to
produce a quality injection moulded part will be highly dependent on
the quality of the moulding tool you create, which in turn is
dependent on the manufacturing technology. 





3D Printers with
good surface finish ( DLP,  SLA, SLS, Polly Jet) 
are
the best solution and can easily
produce both hard silicone
and Epoxy tools.


FDM Printers
are suitable for easily
producing hard
silicone moulds. Producing
Epoxy tools from FDM printed
mould masters requires a lot
of surface finishing which can be difficult to achieve with fine
detail or dimensional accuracy.


Hard Silicone
Tools are suitable for parts with slight overhangs that do
not require dimensional perfection such as artistic pieces. Silicone
is very forgiving of poor surface finishing so is the best option for
FDM printed mould masters. [Images]



Epoxy Tools are suitable for parts with no overhangs, good
draft and smooth surfaces, they can produce dimensional stable and
accurate parts. Best for hi resolution printers. Can be used with
very well finished FDM printed mould masters without fine detail. 
[Images]


Laser cut layered
tools are suitable for producing mechanically accurate and
functional parts such as gears. Layers can be laser cut Plywood,
aluminium or stainless steel sheets.  [Images]


CNC tools
Bench top CNC
tooling in PTFE or Aluminium will give the best possible result for
all parts.








Many-Makers are quite heavy machines, there is a lot of stainless steel in these machines, they are built to last. 


The shipping charges are for direct shipping via surface mail.








World wide Shipping is  $79 for the manual machine, $119 for the Automatic machine and $159 for the Pro machine.

Over the years I have established working relationships with several electronics and laser cutting contract manufacturers capable of fulfilling any quantity ordered, the great thing about laser cut steel is the exact repeatability that comes from the digital cut files, so manufacture can easily be moved to the USA at short notice.













3D
printing is getting more refined, faster and cheaper than injection moulding, so why should I bother with desktop injection
moulding?

The
cost of fast industrial production speed 3D printers are prohibitive
to have on your desktop.
Comparisons like
this, showing
3D printing narrowing the cost gap are based on industrial injection moulding and tooling. Many-maker desktop injection moulding radically changes this game,
it is unbeatable in terms of total cost per unit.



I
have seen or used resin casting for replicating my prints, why should
I bother with desktop injection moulding?

Resin
casting is unrivaled in some purposes and special effects,
however it is a very manual and costly process compared to desktop
injection moulding.
A lot of companies like Protolabs offer services for doing low number injection moulding runs, so why  should I bother with desktop injection moulding?

Protolabs use full size injection moulding machines and are capable of produce much larger parts than a desktop injection moulding machine ever could.
Their tooling costs starts at about $1495 per mould, which is really cheap compared to most services, and manufacturing time  is up to 2 weeks which is also fast for the industry.
However I am targeting way below this - tooling costs at a few $ per mould and delivery under 8 hours. The only drawback of a desktop injection mounding machine is the limited size of the part.





More non technical FAQ ...




Many-maker
sounds under priced, are you sure you are able to deliver at such a
low price?

The
pricing has been carefully worked out at 2.6 x the material cost and
labour
(less Indiegogo and early bird discounts) which is in line with the
recommendations of Ten
rules for maker businesses (2.6 x multiplier).
We keep costs down as follow: 1) No middle man taking a significant
cut means we can offer an Indiegogo and early bird discount, 2)
Clever practical design, 3) Using Laser cut mechanical parts instead
of CNC'ed machined parts, 4) Using Desktop Injection Moulded parts
wherever possible, 6) Using COTS (Common of the shelf parts) as much
as possible, 7) Re-purposing mechanical sub-assemblies from mass
produced automotive products and 8) The key mechanics comes fully
assembled and tested but the cosmetics comes in kit form, this saves
both labor and shipping.



Where
do I buy after market materials?

Either
from Many-Maker as a kit or from independent sources. The molding
compound is widely available, and online from smooth-on (Mold
Max 60).
Raw plastic is available from sellers locally wherever there is
industrial injection moulding industries, usually in 25KG bags at
under $2 per kg. - one bag will last you a long time. We are going to
build a database of regional suppliers and suitable casting and
plastic materials.



Is
it difficult to use?

You
love 3D printing because you like challenges, you like learning new
things, so yes there is a lot to learn, it is a wonderful experience
to learn to make and produce your own creations, but it is not easy.
You will have some failed attempts before you start winning.

Where
can I get more background information on injection moulding?

A
few of my favorite resources are : Scientific
Moulding Pocket guide, PITFALLS
IN INJECTION MOULDING OF PLASTICS, Guerrilla
guide.

Can
you give an example of a cost comparison?

Using an
online cost estimator for industrial injection moulding we
can compare costings for a very simple part.






The
same part produced with a Many-Maker-PRO would be:

Material:
$0.075 per part

Production
: <$0.01 in electricity + TCO of
MM01PRO ($0.1) per part

Tooling:
Total $5 in printing and mould tool casting materials.

Total
: $181 - Plus: Your labour of about 4 hours.



How
would you compare industrial injection moulding with desktop
injection moulding?

When
desktop publishing emerged in the late 80's it was not compared to
industrial printing presses, in the same way it would be wrong to
compare the injection moulding machines as they are vastly different.
An industrial professional can look at desktop injection moulding as
say that it is so limiting, a maker, inventor or entrepreneur can
look at the same machine and say it is so liberating. Its performance
is totally subjective.



What
about technical support?

In
addition to the online video tutorials, I will also have direct
online support. I hope to establish an online community around
desktop injection moulding to expand and share knowledge and
experiences.

Faulty
parts and spares will have to be ordered online, having said that the
machine is very robust so I expect most issues to be user related, or
mould making related.



I
run a 3D printing service, can I offer injection moulding as an add
on?

Yes,
This is a great business opportunity as the cost benefit of desktop
injection moulding is unparalleled for small production runs. I
expect initially there will be a gold rush period during which the
initial adopters will make high profit margins, followed by a plateau
and eventually nearly all 3D printing service providers will offer
low cost injection mould production.

Can
I injection mould non 3D printed parts or crafts?

Yes,
you can make suitable 2 part moulds from just about any object.











I
have seen industrial injection moulding machines on auction for $1K
to $5K, why should I bother with desktop injection moulding?

What
I want to achieve is to put a production machine for under $1000 in
the hands of makers, together with all the material, tools and
know-how in one box - a system to follow and learn from. It is not
about putting a single machine in a few hands, it is about putting a
new skill in lots of hands.

However,
If you are lucky enough to find such a machine, and you can afford it
then you should buy it, but remember it takes up a lot of space, and
maintenance and repair is going to be at industrial machine prices
not auction prices, so best you make sure it is complete and in full
working condition.



Why
are you trying to minimize the role of 3D printing in democratized
manufacture?

If
I reach my objective of widespread adoption of desktop injection
moulding then Many-Maker will be a 3D printing amplifier, and 3D
printing will become more influential in the market due to
Many-Maker's benefits. More makers will see a self defined path from
idea to market, and this self defined path is the driving inspiration
for many makers.



What
happens when my mould tool gets worn out in just a couple of hundred
shots?

Just
make another tool (from the same 3D master print), it is quick and
quite cheap ($3 to $5) depending on size.



More technical FAQ ...






How
does Many-Maker fit the function of a big industrial machine into a
desktop press ?

An
industrial machine is optimized for high speed production with many
cavities and fast cycle times, so it injects plastic melt with
between 800 psi and 12000 psi (big machines even higher), For an
industrial machine the typical cycle time is under 15 seconds and it
can accommodate a large tool that can make multiple (4x 8x 16x or
even 100x) small parts in one shot.

Many-Maker
injects with between 600 psi and 3000 psi into the casted mould tool.
Many-maker has a cycle time of 300 seconds and it can accommodate a
tool about 1/8th to 1/4 the size of a typical small industrial
machine, and would typically make only one part at a time.

High
pressure industrial machines can achieve long 0.5 mm and thinner
walls, with most walls being around 2 mm and runners at 3 mm
diameter. With a many-maker we have to compromise by using thicker
walls and runners. Many-Maker can still achieve high definition, just
not very long thin walls.

Many-Maker
may be slow but it gets a small production run done quicker because
there are no delays in waiting for metal tooling, or queuing for a
production run.



I
know you need metal tools to withstand the pressure from injection
moulding, how can you do it with silicone rubber?

Firstly
we are limited to smaller tools and parts, that reduces the pressure
requirement. Secondly, because silicone has a 50x lower thermal
conductivity than steel we
don't need to re-heat the melt in the mould tool, using
sheer-thinning pressure and gates techniques,
thus the pressure requirement is much lower.

Compared
to metal, Shore 60A silicone is very soft, but because it is quite
dense, when you compress it in a small metal enclosure, it is
surprisingly resistant. The plastic will flow where there is least
resistance so we have built in overflow routes so back pressure is
limited, and when the pressure subsides from the initial injection,
the silicone pushes back and keeps its form reasonably and
predictably well - ideal for characters, Meeples and
irregular shapes. For precision mechanical parts the use of hard
resin cast moulds or CNC'ed metal moulds are recommended. Alas there
will be some features that is possible with metal tooling that will
require compromises and workarounds with polymer tooling.





What
is the largest part I can make?

The
largest mould cavity for the PRO model is 150 mm x 90 mm x 36 mm,
However the largest part will depend on the length and thickness of
the runners and walls, and the compromises you make. If the part you
need is larger you can still make it by bonding, welding or riviting
multiple small parts together.

A
28 cc or 21 gram shot seems tiny and useless, why did you make it so
small?

The
shot size compares well to other small machines like this or this,
which cost much more than what Many-maker costs. A 28 cc (0.7 oz)
shot size is a lot larger than what you may think, so it far from
useless, there are plenty of applications where 28 cc is ample. A
final product could be made of multiple parts, some produced by
Many-maker, some professionally 3D printed, and some even laser cut
from steel, acrylic or wood. Many-maker is part of the ecosystem, you
will find ways to to create your product. The size is limited by the
budget for the servo's and toggle clamp.



Can
I injection mould everything or anything I printed?

No,
you have to Design For Manufacture ( DFM ), this means you have to
follow similar constraints to full industrial injection moulding,
else your part will remain stuck in the mould! 3D printing is capable
of producing objects that injection moulding could never reproduce,
so you have to work within the limits of the technology.



What
types of plastics can be used?

A
well designed mould tool cast in Moldmax 60 and pressed in ABS will
give you a mould tool life of about 500 shots, but just about any
plastic with a melt temperature between 150'C and 290'C can be used.
Higher temperature plastics, filled plastics like carbon fiber and
highly corrosive plastics will reduce the the mould tool life. The
good thing is if your tool gets worn out, just make another, it is
quick and quite cheap.







Can
I modify my own machine?

The
software will be open sourced so makers can modify their own
machines, it is super simple, main thing is to control the heating
profile for different materials - it is nothing like the complexity
of 3D printing, it is simple process control.

Why
is the clamp so much bigger than the injector? / Why is the more
capable PRO model, smaller than the Automatic model?

It
is the norm in injection moulding for the toggle clamp to be bigger
and stronger than the injector, this is to counter the force due to
the leverage of the large surface area of the mould (like
this effect).
The Automatic model is designed for reduced cost so a single inline
actuator is aligned dead center with the spru, this makes the machine
a lot longer than the desktop version, which uses 2 actuators in a C
toggle clamp arrangement, which requires more steel but delivers more
clamping and results in a optimal use of space.





Can
I use CNC'ed aluminum moulding tools or tools printed from steel or
ceramics?

CNC'ed
PEEK or PTFE is a better option for high endurance, high precision
moulds that would work perfectly in a many-maker.

Ceramics
should work very well.

Yes,
metal moulds can be used but the maximum size may be smaller than
what can be achieved with PEEK or PTFE.




More printer FAQ ...


Do
I need a special printer or to print in any special material?

No,
you can print a mould master in any material using any 3D printer
technology, the magic happens when you cast the mould master into a
mould tool. However the surface quality of the print your printer produces will affect what you can produce.



Can
I print the mould directly?

To
print a mould directly you will require a thermosetting mould
material, that means you need a STL or SLS printer. I think the
possibilities are endless and this is probably going to be the best
method of producing mould tools for desktop injection moulding.

Do
I need special software?

No,
you can use the same software you use to run your current 3D jobs. I
plan to have mould templates available for the most common 3D
software. Even if you use something different, the mould templates
are quite simple geometric shapes that you can recreate easily in
your software.





Currently I am on prototype revision 5. 

I have had some experience in commissioning moulded enclosures for previous electronic projects, and  I worked closely with the tool makers, so I thought I had quite a good grasp of the basic technology when I started, but it has been a steep learning curve and has taken 6 months of full time research and development to get to this point. Now finally all the mechanics are working under manual control. It's not perfect yet, and much can still be tuned and improved. Currently I am experimenting with different plastics and casting materials. The last remaining major step is to prefect the servo electronics and write the automation firmware and smartphone software.

I hope to raise enough support to order parts in bulk and to ship the first full production batch in June. 
The biggest risk is delays due to component shortage, which could delay delivery by 4 to 8 weeks. Shipping delays is a secondary risk and may add 2 to 4 weeks.




With your help I hope to democratize injection moulding, put it in the hands of self motivated  makers and thereby  start a new sub-movement in the maker movement, I want to help empower makers to produce products that can compete on unit cost with mass-produced products.
Part of  your funding will be used to buy the expensive testing equipment needed to characterize many of the process parameters such as melt pressure and clamp force, currently these are estimated figures based on comparative performance.

Funding goals:
This is a ""fixed funding"" project so if I do not receive the needed support the project will be cancelled so please spread the word  and help make this happen.
$25 000  Get the first many-makers assembled  and shipped to the customers.  Finish the mobile app to connect locally or remotely to your Many-Maker, to monitor and control every detail of the operation.
$50 000 Stretch goal - a full production run at an economic scale, enables me to add an extra 0.9 kg moulding material and an extra 2 kg ABS resin to all machines.


$100 000+ Stretch goal - move the manufacturing to the USA. It does not make sense to ship tonnes of laser cut stainless steel across the Atlantic. I'd love to live and build Many-Makers in the USA, and experience the culture for a few months. Depending on the cost savings every supporter will get an extra perk.

last 23 years, I own a beautiful home with my wife and I live and work

loved building stuff for myself,  to share and sell, but budget and availability of parts was always a problem, until I discovered 
programming, On my ZX81 (a.k.a. Timex Sinclair 1000) I could create anything in 1KB RAM, share it with friends 
and all it cost was a cassette tape, Programming has been my life, but I
 have always yearned for the day when I can make real things, real 
cheap, share them or make a profit. Inventor reborn. My story is not unique, and I am sure you feel the same way, together we can make more things, many many more things.
If you are not a maker or entrepreneur, but know a cousin or friend that is, please let them know about my
 project, it can really make a difference in their lives, careers and businesses.
Democratized manufacture is going to affect all our lives in the near future, it is an interesting and newsworthy subject, so please share this project with all your friends using the Indiegogo share buttons.

Many thanks

<h1><b>Save time. Save space. Save energy.</b></h1>
<h1>
<b>Save your jeans!</b> </h1>
<h1>The Problem:</h1>
<p>Jeans
 have been around for over 100 years and yet there is no good way to 
hang or dry them.  Yes, isn't that crazy? Folding your jeans causes 
wrinkles and creases. Drying your jeans in a clothes dryer not only 
shrinks your jeans but damages the denim over time. Using drying racks 
to dry your jeans is way too time consuming. Standard clip pant hangers 
take too much time to use, don't work properly, break easily and they 
can damage your jeans. </p>
<h1>The Solution:</h1>
<p>A
 jean hanger that  delicately holds your jeans, is easy to use, never 
creates wrinkles or creases and also helps dry your jeans; all at the 
same time.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>As a designer I have spent my life creating functional apparel and 
products. When I started working for a jean maker I realized that 
standard pant hangers were not functional. I also wanted to save energy,
 and not shrink or damage my jeans by putting them in a clothes dryer. 
So I decided to design a solution that would be simple, long lasting and
 effective. </p>
<br/><h1>Design Details: </h1>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1><b>1) Easy to use.</b></h1>
<p><b>2) No more creases or wrinkles from folding.</b></p>
<p><b>3) Fits on all jeans or pants with standard belt loops</b></p>
<p><b>4) Easy solution for drying jeans </b></p>
<p><b>5) No moving parts</b></p>
<p><b>6) Lasts a lifetime</b></p>
<p><button>Play </button><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Yes, a quality product that will last a lifetime.</b>
</p>
</div>
<p>The
 Jean Hanger is a one solid piece of beech wood with no moving parts. 
Therefore it will not be prone to breaking like other pant hangers. The 
hanger is .5 inches wide so it is very sturdy. As well, the hook is is 
screwed into the wood so that it is secure. If the hook ever breaks, 
which is highly unlikely, it can be easily replaced (by me) without 
having to throw away the essential wood component.</p>
<h1>Sizing: </h1>
<p><b>The jean hanger fits a 22 inch waist to a 44 inch waist jean or pant. </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p> The Jean Hanger(19 inches) is barely wider than a regular top hanger(18 inches) so it fits easily in any closet.
Fits any waist size. </p>

<p><b>Final thoughts: </b></p>
<p>With your support this will be the 
first of many smart designs to come. Our goal, like the jean hanger, 
will be to create functionally better products for everyday use, energy 
savings and convenience. Thank you for your support!</p>

Save your jeans! 
The Problem:
Jeans
 have been around for over 100 years and yet there is no good way to 
hang or dry them.  Yes, isn't that crazy? Folding your jeans causes 
wrinkles and creases. Drying your jeans in a clothes dryer not only 
shrinks your jeans but damages the denim over time. Using drying racks 
to dry your jeans is way too time consuming. Standard clip pant hangers 
take too much time to use, don't work properly, break easily and they 
can damage your jeans. 
The Solution:
A
 jean hanger that  delicately holds your jeans, is easy to use, never 
creates wrinkles or creases and also helps dry your jeans; all at the 
same time.


As a designer I have spent my life creating functional apparel and 
products. When I started working for a jean maker I realized that 
standard pant hangers were not functional. I also wanted to save energy,
 and not shrink or damage my jeans by putting them in a clothes dryer. 
So I decided to design a solution that would be simple, long lasting and
 effective. 
Design Details: 

1) Easy to use.
2) No more creases or wrinkles from folding.
3) Fits on all jeans or pants with standard belt loops
4) Easy solution for drying jeans 
5) No moving parts
6) Lasts a lifetime
Play 

Yes, a quality product that will last a lifetime.


The
 Jean Hanger is a one solid piece of beech wood with no moving parts. 
Therefore it will not be prone to breaking like other pant hangers. The 
hanger is .5 inches wide so it is very sturdy. As well, the hook is is 
screwed into the wood so that it is secure. If the hook ever breaks, 
which is highly unlikely, it can be easily replaced (by me) without 
having to throw away the essential wood component.
Sizing: 
The jean hanger fits a 22 inch waist to a 44 inch waist jean or pant. 


 The Jean Hanger(19 inches) is barely wider than a regular top hanger(18 inches) so it fits easily in any closet.
Fits any waist size.

The Prototyping Process:




The jean
 hanger prototypes were built over the course of a year at the Makerlab 
in Vancouver, BC. Pictures of the process are featured below:












Final thoughts: 
With your support this will be the 
first of many smart designs to come. Our goal, like the jean hanger, 
will be to create functionally better products for everyday use, energy 
savings and convenience. Thank you for your support!

<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p>At Piena, we’re parents first. We understand the challenges that come with a new baby. Our goal is to make your life easier by creating innovative products that take some of the work out of raising a little one—and give you more time to focus on your baby and your family.</p>
<p><b>The Inspiration behind the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker </b><br/>Our own experiences as parents inspired us to invent the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker<a href=""www.mypiena.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a>. When our son was a baby, there were times we needed to make him a bottle. The process—from boiling the water, measuring out the formula, and cooling the water to just the right temperature before adding the formula—took at least 10 minutes. There had to be a faster, more efficient way! We looked around for a baby formula maker. There were plenty of bottle warmers, but nothing that made mixing the formula for the bottle any easier. </p>
<p>So we decided to create our own solution. We talked with moms in the neighborhood to find out what they wanted in a baby formula maker. The answers were always the same: fast, easy-to-use, sterile and safe. Engineers by training, we took what we learned and designed a baby formula maker that met everyone’s needs: the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker.</p>
<p>We named our company “Piena,” an Italian word that means “overflow.” It represents the overflowing love parents have for their children. We are very proud of what we do. We want every family to enjoy their time together.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<b>Step 1:</b> Pour the entire can of baby powder into the detachable powder formula container. It holds up to 24oz. The unique and patented freshness seal guarantees the powder stays fresh and dry up to 4 weeks.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/57339/files/20130906102633-instruc-img2.jpg?1378488393"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Fill the water reservoir to the desired level (2oz/4oz/6oz/8oz), and close the lid.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/57340/files/20130906102653-instruc-img3.jpg?1378488413"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<b>Step 3:</b> Push the start switch to “ON”. The water will come to a boil within 60 seconds. Then the water is cooled to near body temperature and automatically dispensed into the bottle.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/57341/files/20130906102713-instruc-img4.jpg?1378488433"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> Turn the wheel to dispense just the right amount of baby formula powder into the bottle. </p>
<p>2oz bottle – one wheel turn (90° turn to counter clockwise)<br/>4oz bottle – two wheel turn (180° turn to counter clockwise)<br/>6oz bottle – three wheel turn (270° turn to counter clockwise)<br/>8oz bottle – four wheel turn (360° turn to counter clockwise)</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/57342/files/20130906102730-instruc-img5.jpg?1378488450"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<b>Step 5:</b> Remove the bottle from the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker. Put on the nipple and the lid tightly. Shake the bottle and check the temperature of the formula by dabbing a drop of the liquid on your wrist. Now the bottle is ready for feeding your baby.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p></p>

<p><b>Antimicrobial</b>– The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker is specially engineered to inhibit the growth of microorganisms with Microban® antimicrobial protection built-in inside. When microbes, such as bacteria, mold and mildew come in contact with the inner powder container surface and the water reservoir surface, antimicrobial protection penetrates the cell wall of the microbe and disrupts key cell functions so that the microbe cannot function, grow or reproduce. Plus any microorganisms in the water are destroyed during the boiling process.</p>

<p><b>Boils (sterilizes) Water</b>– The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker boils water for sterilizing. </p>
<p><b>Express Cool Function</b>– Once the water reaches the boiling point, the Express Cool Function cools down the water quickly to the perfect temperature for your baby. </p>
<p><b>Detachable Powder Can with Aluminum Finish</b>– The detachable powder container can store up to 24 oz of powder baby formula. The aluminum container can is air and water tight, which prevents air and moisture from affecting the quality of the powder formula.</p>
<p><b>Dishwasher Safe</b>– The powder container parts of the Piena Tender Touch are dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.</p>
<p><b>ETL Certified</b>– The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker is safety certified by Intertek, the leading global testing laboratory.</p>

<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Piena was founded in 2012 with the intention to create appliances that make taking care of babies easier. We wanted to create better, more efficient products for the baby care marketplace—and come up with entirely new products.</p>
<p>One of these new products is our baby formula maker. Before we started our design, we identified several features that we wanted to incorporate into the new product. Our plan was to create a simple yet elegant baby formula maker that was easy to use, fast, and efficient, as well as dishwasher safe.</p>
<p>In the beginning, we focused on finding an innovative solution for express cooling. we needed to find a technical solution that would cool down boiling water (212F) to near body temperature instantly and economically. Due to the lack of technology available, our R &amp; D department had to start from ground zero to create the Express Cool Function. We also started working on an IC board that could safely control the boiling, cooling, and dispensing with efficient SMPS circuits, and began the hunt for the highest quality cooling components for use in the Express Cool Function.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/56213/files/20130905214342-pcb_resize.jpg?1378442622"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>PCB thermal test results</i><br/><p></p>
<p>The industry's most advanced IC board is custom-designed for use with the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker. Our original baby formula maker prototype was created with the goal of demonstrating that it takes about 90 seconds to boil and then cool the water.</p>
<p>Although we were pleased with the initial result, the product wasn’t perfect. The first prototype was bulky and unattractive, and the control buttons were too complicated to use. So we created a new design with only one button for the whole process of boiling, express cooling, and dispensing water.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/56215/files/20130905214515-design_resize.jpg?1378442715"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">After months of discussions and further refinement, we were able to condense the internal circuitry and functions resulting in a more compact version of the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker. The Piena design team created a baby formula maker with a sophisticated, minimalist color profile and a sleek finish. </span><br/></p>
<p>In order to bring our development to reality, we needed to find a manufacturer willing to be contracted with us to produce the innovative product that we developed. After extensive research, many referrals, meetings, and negotiations we were able to find a manufacturer with a similar vision for baby appliances. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the last several weeks, we have continued to improve and refine the product by adding features such as the Microban – antimicrobial function.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</h1>
<p>It has now been a couple of years since we embarked on this journey, and we are finally satisfied with the product that we developed. The Piena Baby Formula Maker is a truly innovative contribution to simplify and improve the quality of family life. For this, we need your help. Your support will allow us to move into full production and manufacturing so we will be able to share this product with you and every other parent on the planet.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><b>Q: Why boiled water?</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>A: Your baby’s immune system may take up to a year to fully develop.1<br/>The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends boiling water used to prepare infant formula until your baby is three months old as<br/>a precaution against illness causing bacteria or if you are unsure about your water supply,2 for which the Pienan Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker gives you peace of mind.<br/>U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that in most situations, it is safe to mix formula using ordinary cold tap water that is brought to a boil, and bottled water should also be boiled before mixing with infant formula.3<p>1 “Immune System Development,” Aliene Linwood RN, DPA, Thomson Gale, Gale, Detroit, Gale Encyclopedia of Children’s Health, 2006,<br/>2 “Infant Nutrition and Feeding: A Guide for Use in the WIC and CSF Programs,” Chapter 4, page 91, revised September 2008. <a href=""http://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/Topics/Infant_Feeding_Guide.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/Topics/Infant_Feeding_Guide.html</a><br/>3 “Guidance for Industry: Frequently Asked Questions about FDA’s Regulation of Infant Formula”, March 1, 2006</p>

ABOUT US
At Piena, we’re parents first. We understand the challenges that come with a new baby. Our goal is to make your life easier by creating innovative products that take some of the work out of raising a little one—and give you more time to focus on your baby and your family.
The Inspiration behind the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker Our own experiences as parents inspired us to invent the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker. When our son was a baby, there were times we needed to make him a bottle. The process—from boiling the water, measuring out the formula, and cooling the water to just the right temperature before adding the formula—took at least 10 minutes. There had to be a faster, more efficient way! We looked around for a baby formula maker. There were plenty of bottle warmers, but nothing that made mixing the formula for the bottle any easier. 
So we decided to create our own solution. We talked with moms in the neighborhood to find out what they wanted in a baby formula maker. The answers were always the same: fast, easy-to-use, sterile and safe. Engineers by training, we took what we learned and designed a baby formula maker that met everyone’s needs: the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker.
We named our company “Piena,” an Italian word that means “overflow.” It represents the overflowing love parents have for their children. We are very proud of what we do. We want every family to enjoy their time together.





HOW TO USE

The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker is quick and easy to assemble. Simply follow the step-by-step plans below. 
Set Up: Assemble powder container as shown in the picture below. Connect the power cord with wall outlet.









Step 1: Pour the entire can of baby powder into the detachable powder formula container. It holds up to 24oz. The unique and patented freshness seal guarantees the powder stays fresh and dry up to 4 weeks.



Step 2: Fill the water reservoir to the desired level (2oz/4oz/6oz/8oz), and close the lid.




Step 3: Push the start switch to “ON”. The water will come to a boil within 60 seconds. Then the water is cooled to near body temperature and automatically dispensed into the bottle.





Step 4: Turn the wheel to dispense just the right amount of baby formula powder into the bottle. 
2oz bottle – one wheel turn (90° turn to counter clockwise)4oz bottle – two wheel turn (180° turn to counter clockwise)6oz bottle – three wheel turn (270° turn to counter clockwise)8oz bottle – four wheel turn (360° turn to counter clockwise)



Step 5: Remove the bottle from the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker. Put on the nipple and the lid tightly. Shake the bottle and check the temperature of the formula by dabbing a drop of the liquid on your wrist. Now the bottle is ready for feeding your baby.



FEATURES





The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker: 

Automatically boils, cools, and dispenses water at the safest temperature for your baby
Has a separate container to store and dispense formula powder
Does not require special bottles
Plus, you can easily adjust the height to fit all sizes of bottles

Key Features:  

Antimicrobial– The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker is specially engineered to inhibit the growth of microorganisms with Microban® antimicrobial protection built-in inside. When microbes, such as bacteria, mold and mildew come in contact with the inner powder container surface and the water reservoir surface, antimicrobial protection penetrates the cell wall of the microbe and disrupts key cell functions so that the microbe cannot function, grow or reproduce. Plus any microorganisms in the water are destroyed during the boiling process.
BPA Free– The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker is made of food grade, high-temperature resistant polypropylene (PP) material. It contains no harmful chemicals and is FDA approved. 
Boils (sterilizes) Water– The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker boils water for sterilizing. 
Express Cool Function– Once the water reaches the boiling point, the Express Cool Function cools down the water quickly to the perfect temperature for your baby. 
Detachable Powder Can with Aluminum Finish– The detachable powder container can store up to 24 oz of powder baby formula. The aluminum container can is air and water tight, which prevents air and moisture from affecting the quality of the powder formula.
Dishwasher Safe– The powder container parts of the Piena Tender Touch are dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.
ETL Certified– The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker is safety certified by Intertek, the leading global testing laboratory.
Microbiology Tested– An independent team of scientists tested the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker to make sure no harmful microorganisms are present in the formula.
Patented & Patent Pending in the United States and worldwide– The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker is protected by worldwide patents.
Easy to Use- There is no complicated process to follow. With a simple click of a button and turn of a wheel, you have a ready–to-use bottle of formula for your baby within two minutes. 
Saves Precious Time– Instead of spending 10 minutes or more to prepare your baby’s bottle, The Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker gives you a baby-ready bottle within two minutes, not 10. That means more time for you to cuddle with your precious baby while he/she enjoys perfectly blended formula, nestled in the safety of your arms. 
WHY PIENA



It’s 2:00a.m….
You hear your baby stirring. It’s time to eat. Making her a bottle—boiling the water, measuring the water, cooling the bottle by running cold tap water, measuring out the formula, then testing the mixture to make sure its not too hot—can take ten or more minutes. Your baby is hungry—and you are exhausted. You wish there was a quicker way. 



An Innovative Solution 
Piena Baby Tender Touch Formula Maker is an award-winning, innovative appliance specially designed to make parents lives easier and babies happier. With a quick turn of the wheel, the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker dispenses a pre-measured amount of formula. Then it quickly heats the water to 212 degrees and cools it to the perfect temperature for your baby. The whole process takes just 2 minutes for a 4 oz standard bottle.

OUR STORY

Piena was founded in 2012 with the intention to create appliances that make taking care of babies easier. We wanted to create better, more efficient products for the baby care marketplace—and come up with entirely new products.
One of these new products is our baby formula maker. Before we started our design, we identified several features that we wanted to incorporate into the new product. Our plan was to create a simple yet elegant baby formula maker that was easy to use, fast, and efficient, as well as dishwasher safe.
In the beginning, we focused on finding an innovative solution for express cooling. we needed to find a technical solution that would cool down boiling water (212F) to near body temperature instantly and economically. Due to the lack of technology available, our R & D department had to start from ground zero to create the Express Cool Function. We also started working on an IC board that could safely control the boiling, cooling, and dispensing with efficient SMPS circuits, and began the hunt for the highest quality cooling components for use in the Express Cool Function.  

PCB thermal test results
The industry's most advanced IC board is custom-designed for use with the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker. Our original baby formula maker prototype was created with the goal of demonstrating that it takes about 90 seconds to boil and then cool the water.
Although we were pleased with the initial result, the product wasn’t perfect. The first prototype was bulky and unattractive, and the control buttons were too complicated to use. So we created a new design with only one button for the whole process of boiling, express cooling, and dispensing water.

Product Design & 3D Rendering

After months of discussions and further refinement, we were able to condense the internal circuitry and functions resulting in a more compact version of the Piena Tender Touch Baby Formula Maker. The Piena design team created a baby formula maker with a sophisticated, minimalist color profile and a sleek finish. 
In order to bring our development to reality, we needed to find a manufacturer willing to be contracted with us to produce the innovative product that we developed. After extensive research, many referrals, meetings, and negotiations we were able to find a manufacturer with a similar vision for baby appliances. 


In the last several weeks, we have continued to improve and refine the product by adding features such as the Microban – antimicrobial function.

WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT
It has now been a couple of years since we embarked on this journey, and we are finally satisfied with the product that we developed. The Piena Baby Formula Maker is a truly innovative contribution to simplify and improve the quality of family life. For this, we need your help. Your support will allow us to move into full production and manufacturing so we will be able to share this product with you and every other parent on the planet.
We are full of great ideas. We will also begin development of a new product. Your support will allow us to accelerate development of a new product. And again everyone will surprise and enjoy our next product as well.

that empower women to be proactive in their own personal safety.
We don’t focus on stats but we do want to affect them - they are staggering, every 2 minutes a women is sexually assaulted in the US –
that is 1 in 6 women will experience an attempted attack in their lifetime.  In more than 95% of all attacks on women there are three consistent factors:
The women is alone.
The women does not have the ability to defend herself.  
The women is unable to summon help either directly or via phone.
Given these three realities, we realized that arming a women with a capability that is always on her, does not need to be retrieved from her purse or car, that can instantly make a difference, would change the game, change the stats. These products can help being a quick conclusion to an attack by giving the women an ability to fight back with a disabling stun to the attacker.  Stun and Run.                  Our functional products are shockingly good-looking and designed specifically for women to deliver a knock
out electric shock at the direction of the wearer.  Together, we can equip women today with simple products that are always accessible to help defeat, detour and thwart a personal attack.Now, that's powerful stuff.
Our founders have worked together for decades - in technology, marketing, start ups and other companies from scratch, as well as, working with partners to launch many new brands and products. MEET BETH: Parent and successful small business owner, marketing genius having worked on some of the biggest brands in the US. Beth has been spent her entire career empowering people and her positive energy is highly infectious.MEET LISA: Parent and seasoned business builder. Lisa has worked with industry leading sports, marketing, entertainment and technology companies throughout her career, loves smart stuff and is now ready to PowerUp!Combined, they have more than four decades of business building experience. With experience in overseas production, celebrity and product placement, non-profit management, community event production, multi-city/national product roll out, online content management and business admin, this company will be well run.  We put together a group of our colleagues who are engineers, designers and others who have helped develop these new technologies into these great products.On a personal note, the founders have kids in college, and they wanted to send their young women to school as emPOWERed as possible.  PowerUp will launch with two bracelet products and a totally stunning ring. The patent pending designs have been in development for 12 months, take a look. We think you will feel electrified with excitement.  We know that we are.Our ATHLETIC style bracelet is minimal,
easy to wear, lightweight, and simply designed for everyday use and night wear in
all kinds of weather.  With a
silicone gel rubberized band, it's one size fits all is
easy to get on and off. The power is released from the two
points that emerge on the silver face of the bracelet when it is armed. 
For runners, walkers, dog walkers, staying at home, going out, going to
the store, going on the road or going around the world.The key to our jewelry is the always lowered posts in the off position and not noticeable.  When you slide the lever to ""On"", the posts rise from the face of the jewelry, are armed and ready to deliver a powerful jolt. Our stylish metal BANGLE bracelet is about
an inch wide and medium
weight.  It is designed for work or a more dressed
up occasion.  The bracelet features points on the
top, which is where the shock is released and are coated on the inside so the
wear can not receive a shock.  The
bracelet features our SureFit design which makes sure the bangle stays
correctly on your wrist, ready to be armed if needed. 
All products are lined with a protective layer  –  so wearer is safe from the shock. The shock is omitted from the posts on the top, and is only felt between the posts where contact is made - delivering a powerful jolt. 
One of the key issues in personal safety, is preparedness or the element of surprise.  Predators look for women on
their phones, distracted, or in a hurry – so even if a women carries a safety device in her purse or car - she may have it with her the the moment it's needed. In addition, research shows that a high
percentage of attacks take place within a home and involve known people - so our
product, which is literally at the women’s fingertips – is ready, accessible
and empowers the women to protect herself at any time and any place that it is
needed.We say our products are for STUN & RUN -  giving you the power to get out of the situation. These items are designed to be disguised as
regular accessories, so it is up to the wearer to share with friends they are
actually are powerful defense devises.  Launch T-Shirts:  These t-shirts are available for indiegogo supporters only.  We will continue to develop cool messages to go on the shirts, so feel free to give us some of your bright ideas - we love them. Who Is this product good for?  For You.  For all women and the men who love them - think about our products for a college student, wife, mom, sister, aunt, cousin, grandma, room-mate, or groups of people - running team, co-workers on the late shift, team mates or sorority - and you of course.  The bracelets are lightweight and simple to manage, but you do need to be over 18 years old.                    Using breakthroughs in ultra-capacitors and micro transformers these state of the art stun jewelry pieces allow for freedom from fear - knowing you can, if needed, defend yourself.  Feel the power sista.  The 130,000 volts of power, launched from these babies will stun and incapacitate an attacker. It only takes minutes to charge and the charge lasts for days so if the light on the bracelet is green you are good to go. If you need to use the stun feature you flip the switch on the side on the bracelet and the light turns red to let you know you are now armed and ready to stun.  At the same time, two posts emerge from the top, which is where the shocks are applied from (see product image for post locations). Whatever those two posts touch, feels the powers - it is instantly live by flipping the switch. These state of the art technologies, including ultra-conductors for immediate charge distribution and materials
that protect the wearer but shock the aggressor - our patient pending products - are a must have.  These advances in technology have allowed us
to create these small but powerful resources for women. You May Have Questions, And We Have Answers
How old do you have to be to buy a StunBracelet?  You must be 18 years old or older to purchase our products.The Is it legal in all states? No, We can not sell or ship to the following states and a couple cities: HI, IL, MA, MD, MI, NJ, NY, RI, & WI and Denson/Crawford County, IA, District of Columbia & Philadelphia.Can I purchase these from outside the US? Sorry no, unfortunately our stun product is only able to ship in the US.  How does it charge? The jewelry plugs into a standard wall charger and are fully changed in a few minutes. Product comes with the charging cord.  How can it change so fast?  The ultra-capacitor.  They absorb energy like a big sponge very quickly. It is so cool.
What keeps it charged? The ultra-capacitor stores energy in place of a traditional battery.
How do I know it is charged?  A small green light on the side of the item lets you know it is fully changed for (at least) the next 24 hours. How do I activate the Stun Capability & Is there a safety switch? Yes, there is an arming switch on the side of the jewelry, which must be switched manually to the on position.  This raises two posts on the front/top of the jewelry - before any shock could be transmitted.  It then requires you to press the surface into someone for the shock to discharge.  The product is made for what we call STUN and RUN. Designed so you can quickly stun an attacker - be released - so you can exit to safety. 
How do I know the shock charge is live?  A red dot illuminates on the side of closest to you - unnoticeable to the casual observer.

www.nonessentials.org
In the modern consumer society goods are cranked out, independent of the actual demand. This method of production leads us to a wasteful society.
The manufacture of products on demand – made especially for the needs of every single person – has scarcity value.
 
 
Products on demand
nonessentials are earth-aware accessories which were born to create economic and sustainable product design, offering you objects that do not yet exist.

The main idea behind nonessentials is that all objects will be recently made to order.
The objects are made from rich birch plywood which is cut by a laser cutting machine and can be individualized by an engraving of the customer’s choice or colored in one of five different color variations.

 
About nonessentials:
nonessentials was called into existence in the context of my bachelor thesis in november 2012.

By then I never expected to have any response at all. Two weeks later - after nonessentials has been featured on a few design websites and in some magazines - I was overwhelmed by the huge amount of requests.
So nonessentials had to grow and people, who believe in the idea, came on board as volunteers’ temporarily.

But now we are a team, and to ensure that this team persists and hopefully grows we need some money. 
 
The future of nonessentials
To keep this project running at all, we need a realistic financial base.
As mentioned above the nonessentials team has to be paid for all its voluntary work, the nonessentials website has to be reprogrammed; we need to have a budget to invest in promotional issues and last but not least we have to improve the scalability of our company by creating an own 'production on demand' factory, in order to avoid mass-producing via off-shore labor.
 
Recently we stumbled across a huge opportunity and took it.
We rented a place downtown Bremen to become an open factory and show-room. Our thanks go to Z.Z.Z. Bremen who helped us finding this spot.

 
Currently we are remodeling and equipping the studio.

Besides of all the work involved, we also had to lean a lot of money from friends & family. This makes your help even more essential.
 
What nonessentials needs to survive:



Pay back the money, friends and family borrowed us for the startup with the studio (basic equipment like paint for walls & floor, euro-pallets for furniture, lighting …): 1.850 €





Hire a programmer to restructure the website (individualization preview, library of motives, account managing, and much more): 1.400 € 




Buy and build an open source laser cutting machine: 3100 €




Pay future renovation & equipment of the studio (build laser-room, customer-lounge, freezer, coffee-maker, storage shelves …): 2800 €



The indiegogo fees of approx. 700 €

When we extend the basic needs of 9850 € we can finally give back something to all the people who volunteered and help nonessentials to exist. 
Furthermore we will be able to buy more open source cnc machines (like a 3d printer and a cnc milling machine) and extend our open on-demand factory.
  
And our vision(s)

We are planning to use new materials and maybe move on to bigger objects like furniture or objects that include more advanced equipment, exploring other cnc techniques…

<h3></h3>
<p><b>The True Story of Bigo Bag Five</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>George and Christian are graphic
designers from Budapest and have worked in the ad industry for more than a
decade.They wanted to explore their creativity and develop their own innovative product.
As they have some experience working with textiles, they focused on fashion and
clothing. While working on the prototype of something completely different it
turned out that they had invented a bag unlike any other.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/810441/files/20140825084447-bbf_prototipus_02.jpg?1408981487"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As they commute by bike in the city, they
started to think about what other functions would be practical for urban bikers.
The ideas came thick and fast.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/810439/files/20140825084439-bbf_prototipus_01.jpg?1408981479"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>The rain poncho and the picnic blanket were obvious. The shape of the bag reminded the guys of a baby sling, so just a
few minor changes were needed to include this function.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/810436/files/20140825084346-bbf_skicc_03.jpg?1408981426"" src="""" style=""""/><p>They sketched out their vision
for the bag, which would be comfortable and sit on your back naturally.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/810437/files/20140825084406-bbf_skicc_01.jpg?1408981446"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>After they had the idea on paper, they
made their first prototype followed by a whole year of product development. Through this process they wanted to try – just for fun –what might happen if they
zipped two bags together.<br/>And it worked! The fifth function was
born.</p>
<p>Thanks to their ad agency experience,
they are conscious of building an attractive and pure brand image. So, they've got
the product, they've got the brand, now they want to take it to the world and build up a
real company. They met Julius and Daniel; two guys who run an ad agency in
Budapest and have considerable expereince in marketing and management. The
newcomers fell in love with Bigo from the first moment, so they quickly got on
board. After an additional half a year, they fine tuned all the details, and now
they feel ready to present it people who are keen on trying great new
things. So try our product. Help us to bring our dream come true, and have a
lot of fun together with your friends and your Bigo.</p>

</div><div><ul></ul></div></div>","The first product being introduced by Bigo brand is Bigo
Bag Five. The Five, as its name implies, has 5 separate functions that provide
all-round convenience and protection any time you need it.
The bag can easily be converted to a rain poncho, a
baby sling, or a picnic blanket. You can even increase the carrying capacity of
the bag by zipping two or more bags together. 
There is really no limit to how many bags you can zip
together.


The Bigo brand aims to create products which are
practical solutions to make your life easier. Every product we launch is
created with the idea of multifunctionality in mind – something you'll have
with you when you need it. Bigo is working on extending its portfolio
with several practical and stylish accessories and products.

A side strap secures the bag safely and
more comfortably on your back while riding a bicycle or doing any other outdoor activity.


Bigo is a perfect accessory with any kind of wear.
The Bigo Bag is designed in such a way as to distribute the weight of 
the bag over a larger surface area – over the whole shoulder and back – making it easy to wear.
A great advantage of the Bigo Bag Five
is that when empty it is very compact, weighing a mere 830 grams.
Additionally, you can fold the whole bag back and pack it into its small internal pocket, enabling you to wear it as a bumbag. 





The True Story of Bigo Bag Five

George and Christian are graphic
designers from Budapest and have worked in the ad industry for more than a
decade.They wanted to explore their creativity and develop their own innovative product.
As they have some experience working with textiles, they focused on fashion and
clothing. While working on the prototype of something completely different it
turned out that they had invented a bag unlike any other.


As they commute by bike in the city, they
started to think about what other functions would be practical for urban bikers.
The ideas came thick and fast.

The rain poncho and the picnic blanket were obvious. The shape of the bag reminded the guys of a baby sling, so just a
few minor changes were needed to include this function.
They sketched out their vision
for the bag, which would be comfortable and sit on your back naturally.

After they had the idea on paper, they
made their first prototype followed by a whole year of product development. Through this process they wanted to try – just for fun –what might happen if they
zipped two bags together.And it worked! The fifth function was
born.
Thanks to their ad agency experience,
they are conscious of building an attractive and pure brand image. So, they've got
the product, they've got the brand, now they want to take it to the world and build up a
real company. They met Julius and Daniel; two guys who run an ad agency in
Budapest and have considerable expereince in marketing and management. The
newcomers fell in love with Bigo from the first moment, so they quickly got on
board. After an additional half a year, they fine tuned all the details, and now
they feel ready to present it people who are keen on trying great new
things. So try our product. Help us to bring our dream come true, and have a
lot of fun together with your friends and your Bigo.

# 1: 50 litre Backpack
 

The size of the Bigo Bag Five varies depending on the
contents of the bag.

Bigo Bags have a capacity of 50 litres. Another great advantage of the Bigo
Bag Five is that in a single swing motion the contents of the
bag are easily accessable.

The side strap gives you more freedom
and security when you're on the go.


Swing the bag to your front so as not to
disturb others and to keep your valuables safe when taking public transport.



There's a handy pouch on the shoulder
strap where you can hold your phone, kleenex, sunglasses or any other
pocket-sized item.

    
#2: Rain Poncho

With just a few adjustments the Bigo Bag Five becomes a
rain poncho, short or long, just when you need it. Just the right protection
whether you find yourself in a drizzle or a downpour. It's also good for light
snow.


Water-resistant material




      


#3: Baby Sling





In one quick adjustment Bigo Bag Five becomes a safe and
comfortable sling that both new mothers and fathers can use. Parents can hold
their children close while at the same have their hands free for whatever they
need to do. Mom, Dad and baby are all happy campers!



     

#4: Picnic Blanket

As a picnic blanket, the Bigo Bag Five is perfect in
the park or anywhere outdoors; just pull it out, throw it down, kick back and
read or chat with friends. And don't worry about wet grass – the Five is
water-resistant.



     

#5: Expandable




You can zip a few Bigo Bag Fives together to make a
much bigger bag; perfect for when you have too much to handle.



     


The Bigo Bag Five comes in twelve
assorted colors made of water-resistant material and all the labels glow
in the dark. That’s cool, isn’t it.



Limited edition of 1oo Bigo Bag Fives with polka dot or bikey pattern and...

...serial number on its label.

<p>Ever since I was little, I never liked how uncomfortable belts were, especially when they would cut into my stomach when I sat down. To solve this problem I ended up wearing a shoelace, which only temporarily worked throughout high school. But now, it’s time for a change. Since there was no belt on the market that solves all the problems that a bulky buckle poses, I decided to make one. Each new prototype is carefully crafted by hand, taking about 4 hours to make. I manually saw the metal clip and sew the leather, resulting in visual perfection.</p><br/><p><br/></p><p>

Modern. Slick.
Ever since I was little, I never liked how uncomfortable belts were, especially when they would cut into my stomach when I sat down. To solve this problem I ended up wearing a shoelace, which only temporarily worked throughout high school. But now, it’s time for a change. Since there was no belt on the market that solves all the problems that a bulky buckle poses, I decided to make one. Each new prototype is carefully crafted by hand, taking about 4 hours to make. I manually saw the metal clip and sew the leather, resulting in visual perfection.

SLÏCK Belts uses a patent-pending small clip to connect the two ends of the belt, with lots of room to adjust in a seemingly bulkless fit. Without the use of any buckle, tie or velcro, SLÏCK belts offers an extremely modern and comfortable belt. Being universally fit for a suit or just a classy night out on the town, SLÏCK Belts will have your pants held up in style.Additional Benefits 
Being a belt that fits both men and women, it
solves another issue that we just recently came across. If and women or
men wear tight shirts, wearing a belt is quite a hassle, with an awkward bulge
at the top of your waist. Fortunately with SLÏCK Belts there is no awkward bulge in the front having a streamline look.

This project doesn’t just stop at one
SLÏCK Belt.  When we get the word out, we
will start coming out with new colors, designs, and shapes to be able to appeal
to everyone. I have had this vision for over 2 years now and I can’t wait for it to come to life!SLÏCK was originally going to sell for $60; so by buying it, you save over 20%! The reason why we need to raise at least $2,000 is for the first line of production. After discussing production with manufacturers and machine shops, at least 50 belts need to be produced in order to bring the price down.

    Bolo  Fresche believes in looking fresh and feeling fresh at ALL times. Started at  bboy jams when HBO Crew would come in &amp; be the Freshest Crew in the Building.  When we dressed SupaDopeFresh, we felt that we could not be topped. So the slogan  “Can’t Git NO Fresher!” comes from that idea.
