<h3>A bit about us</h3>
<p>We are a group of local farmers and producers from around the Okanagan Valley, Armstrong down to Osoyoos. We have banded together to change the way the Okanagan accesses the locally grown product. We firmly believe that what's grown here should benefit those who live here. Its important for us that we support the Okanagan wholeheartedly and we believe this grocery store is the first step in that. Together with your donation we can disrupt the large scale food distributor and bring about a more prosperous future for us all, at a better price too!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's in it for you &amp; for us</h3>
<p>We are offering up some pretty crazy benefits for those who believe in what we will accomplish from the start. From lifetime memberships, to exclusive catered dinners we are offering it all. We hope that you see, with your support we will all benefit. </p>
<p>As far as what's in it for us? We need the money for operating capital to get us through the winter and to help us secure a lease on our first property (hopefully one of many). We will be featuring almost exclusively Okanagan products. If we can get it here, we will get it here, plain and simple. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With each individual donation we are one step closer to a more local and sustainable Okanagan. As a contributor you will have first rate access to the most wonderful meat and produce that the world has to offer. Here in the Okanagan we grow food that is top notch, yet the farmers and the ranchers struggle to make a living. With our new shared service model for the farmers and 24/7 access to a farmers market style store for our customers we can all reap the benefits of our world class produce! </p>
<p>Without you, our backers, this idea for a more local and sustainable tomorrow withers on the vine. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We get it, some of you just can't contribute, it's not in the financial cards. We're farmers, trust us we have been there. That doesn't mean you can't help us out. We ask that if anything we have said to this point sounds like a good idea that you help us spread the word. The more people that know about what we are doing the better off we are as a community. Post for us on your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc. Phone your neighbour and tell them about how excited you are for what's coming. Go door to door and spread the word... Ok maybe don't go door to door! </p>
<p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this much! </p>

I began my cooking and restaurant experience at the age of 15, working as a busboy at IHOP (House of Panckes) in Delray Beach. I went on to work as a short order cook, pantry chef, line chef and head chef assistant (in numerous other restaurants). I learned more about cooking watching my mother, and more about baking, by helping my grandmother.  <br/>
</h4>
<p>       After serving in The U.S. Navy and being ""Honorably Discharged"" I started baking my mother's sweet potato pie recipe in Honolulu, and created a market for them in the island community. I missed my mom's pies and was so far from home, I learned to make them myself. I even went on to create various flavors of sweet potato pies such as....<i>Bourbon &amp; Praline, Banana Chocolate Cream Cheese, Peanut Butter  </i>and nearly 60 others.  All of my sweet potato pie flavors are distinctively different, and delicious, and the combinations work very well together with the sweet potato pie.  I am currently working on a website where you can view a list and some pictures of all the flavors.  I've found some remarkable extracts, aromatic oils and ""creme aromatizzate"" (flavored creams) from here in Italy and many from France, that are unlike anything we have in the U.S.  I have married the three cultures in a delicious union of unimaginable, mouth-watering culinary ecstasy.  I can hardly wait for you to try them.<br/></p>
<p>       I left Hawaii in 2004 after meeting the future mother of my beautiful daughter and moving to Rome, Italy.  I have been here in Rome now for 11 years and teaching English to school students on occasion, and working in films as an extra when available.  The economy is still in ""crisis"" here and I find myself struggling to support myself and family.  Meanwhile, my clients in Hawaii are still asking friends about me and my pies, and a possible return.  <br/></p>
<p>        I left a lucrative, expanding business and a void in a market that hasn't been filled.  There are long time clients there, that have expressed an interest in the past, to maybe participate in a franchising venture after seeing a successful business model.</p>
<p>        With the generous financial assistance of investors from this site, I hope to return to Hawaii, and create that ""Business Model"" and establish a solid means of support for myself and family as well as others that are looking for a means of financial support.  In a crisis economy and changing times as we're seeing right now, I want to help other families and individuals to open their own Gregory's franchise and share the wealth and independence from being their own bosses. Sweet potatoes in some form or another are grown and found the world over. When other cultures taste this ""American Tradition"" they fall in love with it. I want to see ""Gregory's Sweet potato pies"" in as many countries as you see ""Coca Cola, and Mc Donalds.""  Companies that expand and ""mass-produce"" their once ""handmade"" goodies, often lose that home made quality and taste, that brought them initial success.  My dream is to offer franchises to Cooking/baking families that will keep the recipe simple, delicious and home made, while enjoying a fast-growing profitable family business.  I think some of you as early investors will take advantage of the opportunity to one day manage your own ""Gregory's"" franchise.<br/></p>
<p>          With your help, we can start in Hawaii and spread our success across the mainland U.S., through California and cross the country to the East coast and beyond.  <br/></p>
<p>          I'm hoping to receive at least $15,000 to start this process.  We will return to Hawaii, secure a commercial kitchen temporarily, purchase ingredients, appropriate licenses, insurance and contact all customers on our extensive client list and resume pie production and sales.</p>
<p>        I am looking forward to returning to work and seeing my customers and serving them and their families.  Knowing them and watching their kids grow up on this delicious treat the way I did, is a tremendous joy to me.  I would love to share my delightful treats with you all (investors in this dream) in the way of reward perks for your generous contributions.  <br/></p>
<p>              We will continue to run this campaign until we reach our funding goals.  All funds will be used for the purposes stated above.   At the age of 58 years, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me and the families that will be franchisors and partners in this venture.  Myself, like so many others have had dreams in our hearts postponed and even forgotten because of laziness, procrastination and fear of failure and even fear of success.  I am on FIRE right now to see this gift come to fruition! I see you all as my team and encouragement. I will remain in contact with all contributors and invite you all to visit our production facilities in Honolulu, once we are established there.   Thank you all from the bottom of my heart, for helping me to change my life!

 At Amp we are making the world a better place through shared social media promotion.  Amp teams will be able to use social media more effectively.  This will translate in to more successful social media campaigns.
The Kansas City Startup Weekend team behind Amp has participated in numerous successful Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns as well as several successful businesses.   Risks & Challenges Our team is committed to developing a working version of Amp by the end of Kansas City Startup Weekend, however, even the most talented development team may not be able to implement a distributed social media tool like Amp in just 54 hours.  We may not be able to finish the product this weekend and may not be able to come back to the project later.  
Backers should understand that we are primarily looking to validate the market for this product and may not pursue the project after Kansas City Startup Weekend concludes.
If we are unable to complete the Amp app or decide not to pursue the project further we will cancel the campaign and refund all pledges.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you think this app is a great idea and want to provide input into how we can make it better for your crowd funding campaign, tweet @krisadair.  She can connect you with our customer validation team so that we can get your input.",12.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Church’s Taphouse is the dream of three families that have come together and want to help local churches and organizations fulfill their mission and have a greater tangible impact on their community – Mike and Heather Smith, Mike Simpson and Jenna St Clair-Simpson and Zach and Karina Tanksley.
Our campaign is to raise money to open a not-for-profit Taphouse in Hillsboro, OR that will provide financial support to churches and organizations that are filling physical needs in people’s lives.  
Your donations will allow us to open the doors of Church’s Taphouse to the community which will then support churches and organizations that are feeding the hungry, housing the homeless and helping people in need.

What We Need & What You Get

Our funding goal has been set at an ambitious $150000. With that we are looking to:
Secure a location in the AmberGlenn / Quatama neighborhood of Hillsboro, OR
Build out the location including plumbing, electrical, bar, custom tap system, bar stools and table & chairs, etc.
Acquire product (beer)
Any leftover funds will go to pay the lease of the facility


In return for you support of Church’s Taphouse, we have unique stickers, glasses and t-shirts that we’ll be sending out. Also, we have unique packages that allow you to become part of our community by choosing our beer flights and where are charitable contributions from those flights go (within the guideline that the organization is non-profit and is meeting a physical need for people).

<h1>NEW: Adding to our promise</h1><div>When we launched this campaign, we felt that adding 18 million more works to Elog.io was a laudable goal in itself. Thanks to the generous help from Flickr, Safe Creative and Europeana, we may easily add much more than that within days of closing this campaign. We're likely talking about adding closer to 100 million more works to Elog.io.</div><div>This changes our campaign promise. While the goal of raising $6,000 remains the same, we'll be able to do more with what we get. We've included some of our use cases that we've built Elog.io with (see ""What can Elog.io do?"" below) and if we succeed in this campaign, we'll start working off that list to add more functionality to Elog.io.</div><div><br/></div><h2>Our campaign</h2><p>There are billions of photographs on the Internet, but difficult or impossible to find any information about them. We've made Elog.io to make it <b>easier to find information about photos. </b>Giving people access to the provenance of a photo helps them understand who authored it, where it comes from, and makes it possible to build a range of awesome and innovative new tools (see below)!</p>

<p>Do you know where this photo is from? Do you know who took it?

It changes the value of it. So it's a shame that <b>many photos don't have this information available</b>.</p>

<p>This isn't just a theoretical problem. It has practical implications too. Knowing who authored something is <b>essential to be able to give credit</b> to that person, something that's required by many licenses used for photos. If you want to know whether you can include a photo you've found in your blog or not, you need to be able to figure out what license applies to it. The more you know about a photo you've found, the more you can do.</p>
<p>We developed Elog.io to make processes like these easier. At its core, Elog.io is a database specifically suited to store provenance information about any kind of digital work. Information which can be used by anyone. We've demonstrated how this works by building two plugins (one for Firefox and one for Chrome) that uses the information in Elog.io to give information about photo you find online, including giving credit to their authors, automatically. Because knowing the author of a photo is the start of a wonderful conversation and the beginning of unraveling the full context. </p>

<p>I'm Jonas Öberg, a technologist, teacher, software developer, project manager, non-profit serial entrepreneur, husband and father from Sweden. While working as a regional coordinator for <a href=""http://creativecommons.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creative Commons</a>, I came to see how difficult it was for people to attribute correctly, even when they had the best intentions to do so (which isn't always the case). With the help of the <a href=""http://shuttleworthfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shuttleworth Foundation</a>, I began working on a way to automate the process of attribution, building on the idea that giving people and computers access to the provenance of a work enables us to build tools that make use of that information in an intelligent way.</p><blockquote><i>When we started working with Jonas, we thought it was just about automating the process of attribution, but we learned that there's more at stake here: knowing where a photograph comes and who took it is crucial to understand it.

And I hope that I'll one day have that information when i browse the web too. - Helen Turvey, CEO Shuttleworth Foundation</i></blockquote>
<p>Through that work, I realised that the <b>attribution is the visible part of a larger issue</b>; connecting the creators with the works that they have created, and providing context and history to works posted online. But having systems in place that support attribution, would also unravel a lot of other uses. For those viewing the works, it would give them the context to <b>appreciate the works</b>. It would <b>add meaning and value</b>, and offer ways to <b>connect to the creator</b>.</p>
<p>Just as almost anyone who has published something on the Internet, I've seen my work used and abused by others. <b>I enjoy seeing the creative spark that one of my creations could inspire</b>. But not giving credit takes something away. It takes away the connection between myself and my creation. It puts severe limits on how others perceive my work when they see it online. When they can not even find who authored the work, they're prevented from understanding the full context of it.</p>
<p>In this way, Elog.io is also a way to satisfy my own need: it creates the first steps towards creating the largest provenance store for digital works. It allows someone to be inspired by my work and create something new from it, safe in the knowledge that their new work will automatically link back to me, and to its source. As well as allowing someone to publish my work on their own web site or blog and have it automatically attributed and linked back to me. <i>Persistent. Automatic</i>.</p>
<h1>The world according to Elog.io</h1>
<p>Ever since we launched Elog.io, we've used <b>community curated repositories of information</b>. Databases where the community, not only the authors, have come together to curate information about photographs. We want to continue in this spirit, to ensure that the <b>information in Elog.io is respected by the community</b>, because in Elog.io is an implicit acknowledgement of respect for the creator and their wishes regarding their creations. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Elog.io is saying ""we know who created this, and we'll make sure this information is in Elog.io, <b>so that we can provide consistent and accurate information about it for history.</b>""</span></p>
<p>From science to food, we all remix other people's work in order to create something new. Elog.io has the option of including information about the source of every work added. When creating a new song, it can be <b>referenced back to the audio works in Elog.io that were used to create it,</b> contributing to the tree of remixes. You could do this directly in Elog.io, but it'll be <b>more powerful when it's integrated in the tools you use to create</b>.</p>

<p>Elog.io isn't just about photographs though, it's about media. <b>We've purposefully built Elog.io using a standard from the W3C </b>(the ones who build standards for the Web) that's called Media Annotation. <b>It can cover video, audio, images</b>, and a whole bunch of other stuff too. If you can build it, we're pretty sure that Elog.io can describe it.</p>
<h1>How we'll use the money</h1>
<p>We'll use the money from this campaign to get <b>18 million additional photographs under open licenses or in the public domain into Elog.io</b>, and we'll provide documentation and instructions for how you and others can provide information to Elog.io. That's the only thing we'll promise. <b>If we stretch beyond our goal, we'll put all of those resources into expanding on our promise</b>. We could do 40 millions, 100 millions, or more.</p>
<h1>Our budget</h1>
<p>Specifically, the costs that we have to look forward to for the period of March 2015 – June 2015 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Salary for one developer, $1150 per month = $4,600</p></li>
<li><p>IndieGoGo fees (ca 4-9% + 25 USD) = $480</p></li>
<li><p>Hosting fees (database server &amp; storage), $60 per month = $240</p></li>
<li><p>Rewards = $680</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What if shipping &amp; rewards cost more than $680? Don't worry, we've got that covered from our own pockets. Most of the shipping costs are already pre-paid, as are a bunch of t-shirts. We estimate the additional cost of $680 to cover the rewards, but this varies up and down depending on how many contributors we have to the campaign and what rewards they select.</p>

</ul></div></div>","NEW: Adding to our promiseWhen we launched this campaign, we felt that adding 18 million more works to Elog.io was a laudable goal in itself. Thanks to the generous help from Flickr, Safe Creative and Europeana, we may easily add much more than that within days of closing this campaign. We're likely talking about adding closer to 100 million more works to Elog.io.This changes our campaign promise. While the goal of raising $6,000 remains the same, we'll be able to do more with what we get. We've included some of our use cases that we've built Elog.io with (see ""What can Elog.io do?"" below) and if we succeed in this campaign, we'll start working off that list to add more functionality to Elog.io.Our campaignThere are billions of photographs on the Internet, but difficult or impossible to find any information about them. We've made Elog.io to make it easier to find information about photos. Giving people access to the provenance of a photo helps them understand who authored it, where it comes from, and makes it possible to build a range of awesome and innovative new tools (see below)!
Elog.io has a lot of promise to make the world abetter place for photographers and other visualartists. - Jonathan Bailey @ Plagiarism Today
Stop and look at this photograph!

 
Do you know where this photo is from? Do you know who took it? This is a photo of the signing of the Geneva agreement on the settlement of the political situation around Afghanistan, taken by Eduard Pesov. If you didn't know that, chances are you'll think about the photo differently now that you do. Knowing the context in which a photograph appear changes the meaning of it. It changes the value of it. So it's a shame that many photos don't have this information available.
What more is, even when photographers try to include this information, social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter actively or by acts of negligence, remove such information when photos are shared.

Ever wondered where all these ‘history’ pics come from? http://t.co/lD3CG4bHre can be useful for identifing sources pic.twitter.com/KOefX9c6Zv— Theo Kuechel (@TheoKL) December 14, 2014

This isn't just a theoretical problem. It has practical implications too. Knowing who authored something is essential to be able to give credit to that person, something that's required by many licenses used for photos. If you want to know whether you can include a photo you've found in your blog or not, you need to be able to figure out what license applies to it. The more you know about a photo you've found, the more you can do.
We developed Elog.io to make processes like these easier. At its core, Elog.io is a database specifically suited to store provenance information about any kind of digital work. Information which can be used by anyone. We've demonstrated how this works by building two plugins (one for Firefox and one for Chrome) that uses the information in Elog.io to give information about photo you find online, including giving credit to their authors, automatically. Because knowing the author of a photo is the start of a wonderful conversation and the beginning of unraveling the full context.

<h3>A place for Utah Airsofters to call home.</h3>
<p>You know us as Rad and Ajax, airsofters and Owner/Operators of Tactical Airsoft Supply. We have been airsofters since 2002 and we've been supplying and supporting the local scene since 2007. Over the years we have hosted hundreds of local games, fostered teams, supported players and developed airsoft fields. We have consistently grown the sport by sharing media of Utah's amazing day and night games to the world. We have also helped innovate the sport by researching and developing improvements in guns and game play. </p>
<p>We now feel that it is the right time for us to take the next step. It is our ambition to provide sustainable indoor arenas for the Weber/Davis/Salt lake and Utah counties and beyond. We also aspire to facilitate an eventual outdoor field for the entire community to enjoy. We know we cant do it without your support.</p>
<p>With your support we hope that we can move towards our goals together, starting with our Layton Arena. This Arena will be approx 10,000 sq feet and highly detailed with walls, furniture, fixtures and obstacles. We have the conveniently located Layton property currently under contract and we are confident that with your support we will soon be able to buy it and immediately start development.

You know us as Rad and Ajax, airsofters and Owner/Operators of Tactical Airsoft Supply. We have been airsofters since 2002 and we've been supplying and supporting the local scene since 2007. Over the years we have hosted hundreds of local games, fostered teams, supported players and developed airsoft fields. We have consistently grown the sport by sharing media of Utah's amazing day and night games to the world. We have also helped innovate the sport by researching and developing improvements in guns and game play. 
We now feel that it is the right time for us to take the next step. It is our ambition to provide sustainable indoor arenas for the Weber/Davis/Salt lake and Utah counties and beyond. We also aspire to facilitate an eventual outdoor field for the entire community to enjoy. We know we cant do it without your support.
With your support we hope that we can move towards our goals together, starting with our Layton Arena. This Arena will be approx 10,000 sq feet and highly detailed with walls, furniture, fixtures and obstacles. We have the conveniently located Layton property currently under contract and we are confident that with your support we will soon be able to buy it and immediately start development. Your contribution will show us that we have your blessing to make this happen for the Utah Airsoft community and we will work tirelessly to make our ideas into a reality.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name's Aaron Hampton, Co-Founder of Breakout Mobile. For about the last half of my life I've worked in the industrial sector. For nearly half of THAT, I've been involved in new technology and solving the problems related to that technology. Needless to say... I'm a problem solver. I run up against a problem, I want to solve it.</p>
<p>In my career, I've run into a few like minded individuals. One of those individuals introduced me to a type of real life puzzle games called escape rooms. The short version is that you take a team into a room, are given a scenario and a time limit then work as a team to solve riddles, puzzles and other challenges to 'get out' in time. It's unlike anything else I've ever done and I'm HOOKED.</p>
<p>We at Breakout-Mobile are trying to make it a little easier for the guys and gals in the office to step away from the desk for an hour and recharge. We want to build rooms and send them to work campuses so that workers can break out of their office and come back to work feeling like they can do anything. We need your help to fund the first room and get this thing moving.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $60,000 to set Breakout-mobile in motion.</p>
<p>We'll greenlight the project with $45,000 if necessary.</p>
<p>The first $30,000 will go towards procuring a mobile platform and furnishing it for the scenario.</p>
<p>Another $5,000 are set aside for taxes, insurance, services, etc.</p>
<p>The final $25,000 will be held in reserve for operating expenses as we build a name for ourselves and begin seeing more customers each day. While it's extremely comforting to have operating capital in reserve, it's a soft target. We'll be able to move forward with around $10,000 in a pinch. </p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we're going to be offering up Breakout-Mobile Keychains, Tee-shirts, Group discount vouchers, Pre-paid group events, Opportunities to influence future rooms and Even a weekend brainstorming session with the folks at Breakout.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As we see it, the biggest risk to success lies in the support of the community.</p>
<p>If we don't bring quality entertainment to the table, or aren't given a chance to show everyone what a great product we have, we're going to struggle.</p>
<p>On the plus side, we're SURROUNDED by the right kind of people to make this work. Escape rooms are wildly popular here. We're just taking it a step further and bringing the experience to the end customer.</p>
<p>Our team has been involved in startups for the last 10 years. We're familiar with doing whatever it takes to finish a job; we're used to highs and lows and digging deep when you're exhausted but can see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<h3>Grocery shopping just got a whole lot easier!</h3>
<div>Hello everybody, my name is Cole Stanley and I am the founder and owner of Conessen Worldwide. I wanted to create a different type of shopping experience that would bring the foodstuffs and groceries of the world right to you. Instead of having multiple accounts with different foodstuffs providers, you can order right from one convenient location on our website.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The goal is that you will be able to order foods from other countries and have it delivered right to your door without having to worry about hunting your favourites down or those exorbitant fees associated with more traditional methods of acquiring the goods online. This service will work both from and to the US and other countries whether you want your favourite cereal from the US or are anxious to try that new pastry from Finland you've been hearing about and supported countries will be rolling out every month as a result. </span></div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457996927/h2qqzcsxrpgaqdnxqvbb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I devised this company after wrestling with my inability to acquire my favourite candies from Sweden, <i>Ahlgrens Bilar</i>, which are the absolute BEST candies that I have had (so far), easily and affordably. </p>
<p>When I had this issue and found that other websites would either charge me $15 PLUS shipping for an 8oz bag of the candies or simply not have them in stock, I devised a way for people in other places in the world to be able to get their own country-specific grocery products sent to them anywhere in the world for both less than the other guys, and with more variety than they were probably used to.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This service is particularly great for expats or those who are in the military or family members of those who are, who cannot get the foods they are used to or want in the place they currently live and provides the ability to continue to grocery shop as you would normally, and not have to worry about tracking down the foods specifically wanted.</span></p>
<p>In addition, the service provides a way to have daily, weekly, monthly, semi-annually, or annual delivery of products. Therefore, if someone wants to get almost all of their Christmas food shopping done in July, they have the ability to make it happen and can schedule the delivery of the goods on a specific day and simply get right to work preparing their Christmas meal the day before without having to go out to the store or having to search far and wide for their family's favourite type of stuffing or candy canes. It is in this way that convenience becomes a factor as there isn't a service that allows you to place ADVANCE orders and only get charged when the item is fulfilled, not right away.  </p>

<h3>The question of funding:</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are currently searching for about $100,000 in funding to support our endeavors in multiple regards. As this is a startup, it can get very expensive, very fast and as a result there is a monetary buffer built into my goal so that if anything inevitably happens unexpectedly that increases our costs, we will be able to cover it. </p>
<p>The monetary breakdown is as follows and is a basic representation of what we expect costs to be: </p>
<p>Workspace overhead: $6,525/year.</p>
<p>Website hosting and development expenses:</p>
<p>Hosting: $199.99/year.</p>
<p>Continual Development: $500.</p>
<p>Domain: $12.99/year.</p>
<p>Advertising: $5000 for paper, artistic, online, and offline advertising as well as video advertising.</p>
<p>Accounting and taxes:</p>
<p>$258.72/year for accounting software, plus approximately $500 for taxes for the first year.</p>
<p>Working capital for expansion, promotions, design, shipping negotiations, credit file opening and maintaining, inventory procurement, and other miscellaneous expenses including contractors and expanding into the Canadian and European markets: $75,500.</p>
<p>Telephone and technology expenses:</p>
<p>$313.80/year. </p>
<p>Indiegogo and payment processing fees: $5000</p>
<p>General Business Insurance: $5000/year. </p>
<p>We have included a $1,189.50 padding for any costs that stray from what has been estimated and if we raise more than our goal, all proceeds will go into providing working capital so that we may expand our offerings faster and potentially hire more people than originally planned to assist in this endeavor. </p>
<p>Perks will be fulfilled upon the opening of our online store. Coupon codes will be e-mailed to those who have earned discounted or free service and it will be your responsibility to input the codes to receive your perk(s) upon ordering your products. Some time after donating, you will receive an email breaking down what you have earned and instructions for redemption. Please remember that it is your responsibility to input all the codes correctly and at the time of your order.</p>
<p>This ecommerce solution for your everyday grocery needs will open regardless of the funding outcome, but it can open faster and more smoothly with the correct amount of funding and support from everyone and their friends and family! </p>
<p>That being said, in the (hopefully) unlikely event we do not attain our goal for whatever reason, we will reprioritize the funds to pay what needs to be paid first; and, of course, fulfill all redeemed perks. </p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p>This company aims to eventually break down those borders and allow people anywhere in the world, not to just enjoy their own home country's foodstuffs, but also to be curious and order foodstuffs from different places to try something new and learn about a new culture or process. This in turn can allow people to open up to new ideas and become more worldly citizens than they were before they stumbled upon us.</p>
<p>At Conessen Worldwide, we're trying to break down social borders once and for all, and while we doubt we will stop <i>all </i>the fighting and challenges in the world, we endeavor to open the collective world's mind up to new cuisine and new experiences that they may have never thought about trying beforehand. </p>

So there will be no business opening at this time until I find another space. Thank You for your understanding, and if you have donated to this project you will be refunded. </p><p>Hello my name is Sky Geller. Some  of you may know me already, given that be family, friends and or social media, but for those that don't, let me start out by telling you a little about myself. I'm a mother, soon to be up and coming small business owner and collector of the MACABRE. I have a deep passion for Osteology along with History. I have worked in retail for the past 11 years and have been collecting for 9 years, actively for the past 4. Recently I have gotten the opportunity to be in a book project entitled ""Collectors Of The Macabre"" with Laurence King Publications of London and editor Paul Gambino. Most of my collection will be published in the beginning of next year 2016.  Twelve other collectors and I were carefully selected for this project, along with Evan Michelson, Ryan Mathew Cohn, Brent Stuart, Nathan Roberts and Calvin Von Crush just to name a few.  My collecting interests are Real Human Bone, Poisons and Medical items but not limited too.  I purchase all my pieces 100% legally through museums, archaeologist, professors, doctors and other collectors like myself.</p><p>My collection is growing frequently which has prompted my decision into opening my own business / museum in entitled ""St. Augustine Skull &amp; Bone Museum"", which I am rather overjoyed about. This projects had been in the works for the past two years now and I am so excited to say that on the 1st of November I am singing a lease on a small cute little spot on Spanish Street in down town historic St Augustine, for those of you that know about this ancient city I'm sure you would agree this is more then a great spot to open such a project of this nature. Given the local ghost tours, pub crawls and Flagler collage students this has great educational purposes. </p><p>With this news, I am hoping that you will consider helping me fund my business as one that will be welcomed by all patrons, both tourist and locals alike.

So there will be no business opening at this time until I find another space. Thank You for your understanding, and if you have donated to this project you will be refunded. Hello my name is Sky Geller. Some  of you may know me already, given that be family, friends and or social media, but for those that don't, let me start out by telling you a little about myself. I'm a mother, soon to be up and coming small business owner and collector of the MACABRE. I have a deep passion for Osteology along with History. I have worked in retail for the past 11 years and have been collecting for 9 years, actively for the past 4. Recently I have gotten the opportunity to be in a book project entitled ""Collectors Of The Macabre"" with Laurence King Publications of London and editor Paul Gambino. Most of my collection will be published in the beginning of next year 2016.  Twelve other collectors and I were carefully selected for this project, along with Evan Michelson, Ryan Mathew Cohn, Brent Stuart, Nathan Roberts and Calvin Von Crush just to name a few.  My collecting interests are Real Human Bone, Poisons and Medical items but not limited too.  I purchase all my pieces 100% legally through museums, archaeologist, professors, doctors and other collectors like myself.My collection is growing frequently which has prompted my decision into opening my own business / museum in entitled ""St. Augustine Skull & Bone Museum"", which I am rather overjoyed about. This projects had been in the works for the past two years now and I am so excited to say that on the 1st of November I am singing a lease on a small cute little spot on Spanish Street in down town historic St Augustine, for those of you that know about this ancient city I'm sure you would agree this is more then a great spot to open such a project of this nature. Given the local ghost tours, pub crawls and Flagler collage students this has great educational purposes. With this news, I am hoping that you will consider helping me fund my business as one that will be welcomed by all patrons, both tourist and locals alike. The Skull & Bone will bring a unique and diverse outlook on, Osteology, Anatomy, History and Visual Arts.I'm looking forward to being able to reach my goal and open doors as soon as possible.  Your contributions will mainly go towards educational hand built custom displays and some initial buisness coast setups.  I am starting out small do to expenses, and limited space available in the town. I myself have high hopes for expansion and making the Skull & Bone a permit fixture in St. Augustine Florida. With an estimate of 3.7-5 million visitors a year. NOTE! The skull pictured will be on display and along with 20 plus other displays. Xxx. Also to any collectors that want to join in this project by donating a skull of choice, I will have a designated wall for us collectors and will place a plaque or document of your choice with your contact name, business, email and or social media next to your skull donation.

<h5>FRESH LEAF HERBAL TEA</h5></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p>If you can resist the lure of convenience that dried loose leaf tea offers, making tea from fresh ingredients has added health benefits. Herbalists recommend fresh over dried because some active ingredients are compromised during the drying process.</p>
<p>Freetii's features include a 'mortar and pestle' and a 'knife and chopping board' all designed to conveniently cut, chop and press fresh herbs. The advantage of using these utensils to prepare your tea is that the juices and in turn mess is contained within the inner surfaces of the mug. </p>

<br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><b>Hot Water Infusion</b></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">To make iced tea quickly, use hot water infusion.  Place loose leaf black tea in the wooden part of the mug, twist on the clear part of the mug and add boiling water.  Allow the tea to steep for the amount of time you desire, then add corn syrup, ice, cold water, and any flavour hints like lemon or peach.  Although the tea stays in the mug the ice cold water will slow the steeping process preventing your tea from going bitter (view the 30-second demo of this preparation method under the 'More Info' heading).</figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> <p><br/></p>

<h5>FREETII FOR HEALTH</h5>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Some health professionals have concerns about the chemicals used to make some tea bags.  Dr. Mercola published an article ""Tea Bags - A Surprising Source of Potential Toxins"".  </span><a href=""http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/04/24/tea-bags.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">View article</a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.  </span>Freetii<span style=""background-color: initial;""> parallels the convenience of bagged tea so that you can enjoy quick and effortless loose leaf tea and have peace of mind that your tea is free of toxins.</span></figure>
<p></p>
<div>Freetii is designed to get the most out of your herbal tea. It does this in three ways; no loss of oil and juice during the transfer from mortar to mug, the continuous steeping design, and by containing the nutrients through the use of the cover during steeping.</div>

<h5>FREETII FOR TASTE</h5>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It is widely regarded that whole loose leaf tea has a better flavour than bagged tea.  This can be attributed to three main reasons:</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">1. bagged tea is usually made from low tea grades, such as dust and fannings which tend to lose their flavour containing oils quicker.</span></p>
<p>2. bagged tea is usually a mixed blend from various sources and regions, whereas whole leaf tea is usually a specialty tea from a specific region. </p>
<p>3. The conventional bag limits the infusion because of the restricted area that the tea is contained within.  </p>

<p>When I was young I asked my older brother's friend Derryn who was a passionate innovator what idea he was currently working on?  He replied, ""tell me a problem and I'll tell you an idea"".  It bugged me because he never did answer my question.  However, the words stuck with me and his influence forever made me see problems in a new light.   </p>
<p>The idea for Freetii came about when I was making fresh peppermint tea to ease an unsettled stomach.  After pressing the fresh peppermint leaves, and transferring them into my mug, I noticed a lot of the oil and juice was left in the mortar and I couldn't find an effective way of transferring it into my mug.  I was faced with a problem, so off I went, the creative cogs started turning and the desire to develop a solution resulted in Freetii. </p>
<p>It was exciting developing Freetii because it evolved far beyond our expectations. The initial concept was a tea-pot with herb pressing functionality.  After questioning why things are the way they are the concept for the two piece mug was conceptualised.  As we resolved the finer details it evolved, progressively adding more functions until it became the multipurpose, multifunctional  mug that is Freetii.</p>

Loose leaf tea is known for its premium quality and refined taste, yet we consume a huge amount more of bagged tea. The lure of convenience that bagged tea offers seems to overshadow our desire for quality.

FreetiiTM is the all in one premium tea infusing mug and yes, as the intro alludes, we're boasting how convenient it is.








The patented innovation is in the two piece mug design which allows you to effortlessly prepare loose leaf tea with a simple load, twist, and pour. Freetii is ideal for iced tea lovers and those that enjoy a healthy herbal infusion.  



















Freetii is great for making herbal tea, you can make herbal tea in three simple steps; place tea in the base, twist on the top mug attachment and pour in boiling water.  With the travel version of Freetii, you only need to place the lid thereafter and you can be on your way while your tea is still infusing. 

LOOSE LEAF HERBAL TEA
Freetii's continuous steeping design holds the tea leaves in the bottom portion of the mug while the top portion is filtered ready for you to enjoy at any time.






FRESH LEAF HERBAL TEAIf you can resist the lure of convenience that dried loose leaf tea offers, making tea from fresh ingredients has added health benefits. Herbalists recommend fresh over dried because some active ingredients are compromised during the drying process.
Freetii's features include a 'mortar and pestle' and a 'knife and chopping board' all designed to conveniently cut, chop and press fresh herbs. The advantage of using these utensils to prepare your tea is that the juices and in turn mess is contained within the inner surfaces of the mug. 









Freetii is great for making iced tea, there are two methods in which you can prepare iced tea using Freetii; cold water infusion, and hot water infusion.   
Cold Water InfusionIf time is on your side cold water infusion is a very convenient way to make iced tea.  Simply place loose leaf tea, cold water, and raw cane sugar in the mug.  Pop the travel lid on and place Freetii in the fridge overnight.  In the morning your iced tea is ready is ready to take with you.  This is a variation of sun tea (where the sun is used to warm the water which fastens the process).  
Hot Water InfusionTo make iced tea quickly, use hot water infusion.  Place loose leaf black tea in the wooden part of the mug, twist on the clear part of the mug and add boiling water.  Allow the tea to steep for the amount of time you desire, then add corn syrup, ice, cold water, and any flavour hints like lemon or peach.  Although the tea stays in the mug the ice cold water will slow the steeping process preventing your tea from going bitter (view the 30-second demo of this preparation method under the 'More Info' heading).

FREETII FOR HEALTH
Some health professionals have concerns about the chemicals used to make some tea bags.  Dr. Mercola published an article ""Tea Bags - A Surprising Source of Potential Toxins"".  View article.  Freetii parallels the convenience of bagged tea so that you can enjoy quick and effortless loose leaf tea and have peace of mind that your tea is free of toxins.

Freetii is designed to get the most out of your herbal tea. It does this in three ways; no loss of oil and juice during the transfer from mortar to mug, the continuous steeping design, and by containing the nutrients through the use of the cover during steeping.



 



FREETII FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
As well as health benefits there are environmental benefits for using loose leaf over bagged tea.  Rebecca Smithers from The Guardian reports that the ""vast majority (of tea bags) are only 70-80% biodegradable"".   View article.Freetii is designed with environmental design principles at the forefront.  At the end of Freetii's life, Freetii can be easily dismantled into the individual material types for recycling.  An even better option is to repurpose Freetii, Freetii is a mortar and pestle after all.  A sustainable wood is very important, the mortar and pestle are made from fast-growing acacia which is regarded as one of the most sustainable wood types.  
FREETII FOR TASTE
It is widely regarded that whole loose leaf tea has a better flavour than bagged tea.  This can be attributed to three main reasons:
1. bagged tea is usually made from low tea grades, such as dust and fannings which tend to lose their flavour containing oils quicker.
2. bagged tea is usually a mixed blend from various sources and regions, whereas whole leaf tea is usually a specialty tea from a specific region. 
3. The conventional bag limits the infusion because of the restricted area that the tea is contained within.  






 


 by Neil Strohbeck
When I was young I asked my older brother's friend Derryn who was a passionate innovator what idea he was currently working on?  He replied, ""tell me a problem and I'll tell you an idea"".  It bugged me because he never did answer my question.  However, the words stuck with me and his influence forever made me see problems in a new light.   
The idea for Freetii came about when I was making fresh peppermint tea to ease an unsettled stomach.  After pressing the fresh peppermint leaves, and transferring them into my mug, I noticed a lot of the oil and juice was left in the mortar and I couldn't find an effective way of transferring it into my mug.  I was faced with a problem, so off I went, the creative cogs started turning and the desire to develop a solution resulted in Freetii. 
It was exciting developing Freetii because it evolved far beyond our expectations. The initial concept was a tea-pot with herb pressing functionality.  After questioning why things are the way they are the concept for the two piece mug was conceptualised.  As we resolved the finer details it evolved, progressively adding more functions until it became the multipurpose, multifunctional  mug that is Freetii.

und teilt meine Affinität für die Gastronomie und wird sich unter
anderem um den IT Bereich in unserem zukünftigen Unternehmen
kümmern. Wir möchten die Berliner Gastronomie mit einem weiteren
Highlight bereichern.

Unser Angebot umfasst Pizza, Pasta und
Burger zubereitet ausschließlich aus Bio-Zutaten. Jedes Gericht das wir anbieten,wird es auch als veganes
Pendant geben. Eine Große Auswahl an frischen Salaten und Smoothies
runden das Angebot ab. Selbstverständlich bieten wir nur Biogetränke
an. Um unseren Ernährungsbewussten Kunden die Auswahl zu
erleichtern, versehen wir alle Speisen mit einer Kalorien Angabe.
Aber wir wollen noch mehr. Unser
Konzept beinhaltet auch den weitestgehendsten Verzicht auf
Einwegverpackung. Wir liefern unsere Speisen in speziellen
Transportgefäßen aus, die der Fahrer gleich wieder mitnimmt.
Dadurch entsteht weder für den Kunden, noch für uns Müll und
entlastet die Umwelt. Unsere frisch gemixten Smoothies liefern wir in
Glas-Pfandflaschen aus.


Die Auslieferung erfolgt, der Umwelt
zuliebe, mit Elektrofahrzeugen.
Für die Einrichtung und Gestaltung unseres Geschäfts sowie für die besonderen Transportgefäße und die Anschaffung der Elektrofahrzeuge, benötigen wir  noch 35000,- €

<h3>Stella’s needs your help </h3>
<p>Hello everyone, Neal and Amber here. We are the owners of Stella’s Taproom &amp; Grille in Westfield MA. We opened a great little restaurant in Westfield because we love the small town feel and the tight community that Westfield has to offer. For us to continue to be a part of the town of Westfield, we need a hand with some funding. Improving our operations will help us serve you better.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We want to grow and stay open in Westfield</h3>
<p>The costs of opening Stella’s far exceeded our projections. We did work with the Massachusetts Small Business Development Center, in Springfield, to help determine our needs. We now need to get over some financial growing pains and start moving forward with getting Stella’s to its next level. We need some working capital to replace some existing equipment and buy some new equipment and in general, keep the doors open.</p>
<p>We want to expand the menu to give you more choices of our great homemade food. We want to grow our business so that we can be a source for Westfield to look to when community drives need a location to host events. We want to  grow our business so that we can be charitable to the great causes that arise in the town of Westfield. We want to grow our business and be a great corporate citizen that can help nurture the growth of downtown Westfield and the Gaslight District. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Great Food, Great People</h3>
<p>All of you who have come in to Stella’s and gotten to know us seem to like us. What we see it the great people who live here come in and visit, with us and your neighbors. At every turn we try to provide the genuine hospitality that any neighbor would give if you entertained folks in your own home. The idea we had when opening Stella’s was to provide and place for people to come in and eat, drink and spend time away from the daily grind. We eventually want to make the seating more comfy for y’all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>It has been a tough few months</h3>
<p>While we have pretty good nights on Friday and Saturday. We do not get much traffic in for lunch and during the week for dinner. We are trying to stay committed to 7 day and week lunch and dinner service but we have several days per week that fall below our operating cost threshold.  </p>
<p>Please spread the word, If you have been here and had a good time and a good meal; tell everyone you know. The more people who come through the door will make us better at every turn. Amber and I might know about 50 people here in town by name, but we would like to know a few thousand eventually. Everyone reading this I hope will help in some way, by donating or telling a friend or coming back in. Indiegogo has a bunch of different ways you can help us,  please use whichever one works best for you.</p>

</div></div>","Stella’s needs your help 
Hello everyone, Neal and Amber here. We are the owners of Stella’s Taproom & Grille in Westfield MA. We opened a great little restaurant in Westfield because we love the small town feel and the tight community that Westfield has to offer. For us to continue to be a part of the town of Westfield, we need a hand with some funding. Improving our operations will help us serve you better.

We want to grow and stay open in Westfield
The costs of opening Stella’s far exceeded our projections. We did work with the Massachusetts Small Business Development Center, in Springfield, to help determine our needs. We now need to get over some financial growing pains and start moving forward with getting Stella’s to its next level. We need some working capital to replace some existing equipment and buy some new equipment and in general, keep the doors open.
We want to expand the menu to give you more choices of our great homemade food. We want to grow our business so that we can be a source for Westfield to look to when community drives need a location to host events. We want to  grow our business so that we can be charitable to the great causes that arise in the town of Westfield. We want to grow our business and be a great corporate citizen that can help nurture the growth of downtown Westfield and the Gaslight District. 

Great Food, Great People
All of you who have come in to Stella’s and gotten to know us seem to like us. What we see it the great people who live here come in and visit, with us and your neighbors. At every turn we try to provide the genuine hospitality that any neighbor would give if you entertained folks in your own home. The idea we had when opening Stella’s was to provide and place for people to come in and eat, drink and spend time away from the daily grind. We eventually want to make the seating more comfy for y’all.

It has been a tough few months
While we have pretty good nights on Friday and Saturday. We do not get much traffic in for lunch and during the week for dinner. We are trying to stay committed to 7 day and week lunch and dinner service but we have several days per week that fall below our operating cost threshold.  
Please spread the word, If you have been here and had a good time and a good meal; tell everyone you know. The more people who come through the door will make us better at every turn. Amber and I might know about 50 people here in town by name, but we would like to know a few thousand eventually. Everyone reading this I hope will help in some way, by donating or telling a friend or coming back in. Indiegogo has a bunch of different ways you can help us,  please use whichever one works best for you.
Thanks,

<strong>Intro. </strong>In a period when entrepreneurial focus is on internet related things (I.o.T), only few seek solutions for their employees’ better life, the working and personal life (I.o.People). <i><u>Do you agree with this?</u></i> Seeing this wrong direction and wishing to make a first step, hoping the others will come and follow by seeing the positive results, we are proposing you to back-up a social model that should materialize in a benefits circle for all involved: employees-entrepreneur-society. <i><u>Have you ever thought and acted to change something you considered should be adjusted, doing it  in the others' benefit too?</u></i>  The model testing should be done on a minimum two entrepreneurial start-ups (for higher relevance should be on 5-10), and last for at least one year before concluding the results. The results should be scaled, due to high collective advantages provided. </li></ul><p style=""margin-left:160px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546940215/cmgie5b1b3xthtkr0492.jpg"" src=""""/> </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">What we aim to prove?  That social circle programs are  functional and offer many social advantages, not just to those directly involved.</p><ul><li>
<strong>History. </strong>Working with hundreds of companies in the last years, we many times observed the improper attention provided to their employees in different projects, although they were the ones delivering the projects. This bothered us. <i><u>Are we the only ones who feels this?.</u></i> There ‘in the basement’ this feeling started to grow and the change-seed appeared. The ‘plant’ got so big so it had to burst in an entrepreneurial initiative, including a plan to deal with the source of discontent. We could  only finance part of the changing plan, but together we could do it the proper and fully-relevant way. We  honestly need you.</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><u>Do you join the change journey?</u></i>  </p><ul>

<strong>The program name. </strong>Current draft version is ""Social Circle"" due to circle of benefits it creates.

By focusing on how entrepreneurs could be stimulated to provide a better experience for their employees, receiving in return something significant for them too.  For the entrepreneur we have addressed the issue of  finding a proper and decent priced office location. The office would take more the form of a co-working space providing for employees more interconnection options. The final focus was and it would be  the people.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The <strong><i><u>demands</u></i></strong> for each party involved:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546958333/hpw9h0m5nxin1kiq4wme.jpg"" src="""" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'/></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> How were the <u><strong><i>demands</i></strong></u> selected? By looking where are the major social issues, over which  we can take effective actions with instant and relevant effects. So, according to public data for 2018: in only few studies the people are mentioned as a top 5 strategic interest point for an entrepreneur;  only 2% of Romanian population donates blood (vs. approx 59% France &amp; Austria); we selectively collect only 5% from the garbage requested by EU; only one out of five Romanian companies gets involved in social and charity projects (a study form 2014). Focusing on them the demands were selected.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> Would this <i><u><strong>demands</strong></u></i> be relevant for you and your country? If you are not  a Romanian, probably not, but the social model is an adjustable one, starting from a screening of the top 5 major relevant issues over which at low level you can act with instant effect.</p><ul><li>
<strong>Funding needs. </strong>Detailed computations of the finance necessities drove as to an interval of approx <strong><i>amount/year/participant</i></strong> of $4,800 (a single participant program) and descending to approx $2,800 (a five participants program). The more participants, the lower the necessary amounts for each, due to shared expenses. <i><u>More is less.</u></i>
</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The structure of the above $4,800 costs is: 70% lower rent, 9% utilities, 9% taxes/amounts clearing, 6% free internet, 5% space planning and security and 2% property fees.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The lowered rent (paying only 50% of the market value) would give them access to an private or shared office of max 20 sqm with another shared 20 sqm meeting room and kitchen. The average renting price in Cluj-Napoca is $14/sqm.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">To be noted that participants would still have to make personal contributions including: 1% of the turnover to charity (approx $500), half of the rent value, office fittings and equipment, consumables.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The number of participants will be determined based on total collected amounts, as follows:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546962678/binwbrxdypwrsyhvoa29.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p><ul><li>

Intro. In a period when entrepreneurial focus is on internet related things (I.o.T), only few seek solutions for their employees’ better life, the working and personal life (I.o.People). Do you agree with this? Seeing this wrong direction and wishing to make a first step, hoping the others will come and follow by seeing the positive results, we are proposing you to back-up a social model that should materialize in a benefits circle for all involved: employees-entrepreneur-society. Have you ever thought and acted to change something you considered should be adjusted, doing it  in the others' benefit too?  The model testing should be done on a minimum two entrepreneurial start-ups (for higher relevance should be on 5-10), and last for at least one year before concluding the results. The results should be scaled, due to high collective advantages provided.  What we aim to prove?  That social circle programs are  functional and offer many social advantages, not just to those directly involved.
History. Working with hundreds of companies in the last years, we many times observed the improper attention provided to their employees in different projects, although they were the ones delivering the projects. This bothered us. Are we the only ones who feels this?. There ‘in the basement’ this feeling started to grow and the change-seed appeared. The ‘plant’ got so big so it had to burst in an entrepreneurial initiative, including a plan to deal with the source of discontent. We could  only finance part of the changing plan, but together we could do it the proper and fully-relevant way. We  honestly need you.Do you join the change journey?  

The program name. Current draft version is ""Social Circle"" due to circle of benefits it creates. The final name will be established together with you and the most creative and most appreciated version will win. Acquire the Perk ""Significant vote right"" for extra voting right.

The social model and the targeted effects. The program targets:
 Deeper program technical information (how it works, updates and others) are available in our Facebook Group. Link: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1953439628297894/  The benefits for each party involved:How were the benefits selected? By focusing on how entrepreneurs could be stimulated to provide a better experience for their employees, receiving in return something significant for them too.  For the entrepreneur we have addressed the issue of  finding a proper and decent priced office location. The office would take more the form of a co-working space providing for employees more interconnection options. The final focus was and it would be  the people.The demands for each party involved: How were the demands selected? By looking where are the major social issues, over which  we can take effective actions with instant and relevant effects. So, according to public data for 2018: in only few studies the people are mentioned as a top 5 strategic interest point for an entrepreneur;  only 2% of Romanian population donates blood (vs. approx 59% France & Austria); we selectively collect only 5% from the garbage requested by EU; only one out of five Romanian companies gets involved in social and charity projects (a study form 2014). Focusing on them the demands were selected. Would this demands be relevant for you and your country? If you are not  a Romanian, probably not, but the social model is an adjustable one, starting from a screening of the top 5 major relevant issues over which at low level you can act with instant effect.
Funding needs. Detailed computations of the finance necessities drove as to an interval of approx amount/year/participant of $4,800 (a single participant program) and descending to approx $2,800 (a five participants program). The more participants, the lower the necessary amounts for each, due to shared expenses. More is less.
The structure of the above $4,800 costs is: 70% lower rent, 9% utilities, 9% taxes/amounts clearing, 6% free internet, 5% space planning and security and 2% property fees.The lowered rent (paying only 50% of the market value) would give them access to an private or shared office of max 20 sqm with another shared 20 sqm meeting room and kitchen. The average renting price in Cluj-Napoca is $14/sqm.To be noted that participants would still have to make personal contributions including: 1% of the turnover to charity (approx $500), half of the rent value, office fittings and equipment, consumables.The number of participants will be determined based on total collected amounts, as follows: 
Backers rewards. You can get the satisfaction of supporting this social project, one that can positively change us all.Acquiring perks you would benefit from:What other perks would you like to receive?
What if? What if the support values would not be enough not even for one participant program? Then we would decrease the level of the rent subsidized, but no lower than 25%, a significant step for the actions the participant would have to do as program demands. As organizer, I am expecting to incur some expenses, for unpredictable situations, that I would cover from my pocket.What would you do if the targeted value is not collected? Give us ideas.

feasible for anyone. We're out to change that using Craftolia.com! Help us
establish this initiative to serve people in need of a solution. With no start
up costs you can start your very own online business and sell your arts and

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><b><i>How
much is it going to cost you to start the business you’ve dreamed of?</i></b></p>
<p>In 2009, the Kauffmann Foundation estimated that the average start-up cost was
approximately $30,000. The truth is that no business is the same and many
micro-businesses can get started for as little as $3,000 or less, but this is
still a sizable cost. These businesses are often home-based sole
proprietorships with low upfront investments. Another low-cost option is a
franchise. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433338892/nixupq8juv7yjcspsyfi.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 320px; float: right;""/>
While your average Main Street franchise may require a larger
investment, home-based franchises can be started with as little as
$1,000-$5,000, but with Craftolia.com you can still. – This fact prompted us to
dig deeper into a solution, where people can sell their items without these
large fees.  This is where we started to
envision “Craftolia.com” and all the possible benefits we could bring to people:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>Global platform<br/>
</li>
<li>Social sharing options</li>
<li>Low start up costs</li>
<li>User friendly functions</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>When reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us
that this is a business that needs to be created. We feel if executed properly
we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier way to sell.  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the industry. 
This paired with attention to detail and quality service will make us a
key player if not leader in the industry of online sales platforms. Our mission
is to take care of every funder, supporter and customer with the upmost respect
and care.  We feel this will be the key to our growth.</p>

developed a unique marketplace where you can buy one of a kind piece and sell
items that you make in your own home. 
This marketplace was made in order to give people a place to showcase
their handmade items.  We think it will
help people in need of a solution for the barriers of entry to starting a small
business.
Do you ever think about starting your own small business where you sell items you
make yourself?Do you want to sell items you hand
makes but feel that you lack of knowledge, funds or experience?
Are you interested in
making extra money on the side but don’t have the time?
If you answered, “Yes” to
any of these questions, you may want to keep reading…
Overview
Our popular culture
reinforces the idea that starting a small business is difficult and not
feasible for anyone. We're out to change that using Craftolia.com! Help us
establish this initiative to serve people in need of a solution. With no start
up costs you can start your very own online business and sell your arts and
crafts.  Bringing this platform to an
individual can change their ideas about what
they can accomplish for the rest of his or her life.  Finding out your art can be posted online with
ease will be life changing. Empower us to make this vision a reality with
a donation to this project today!
Our Story
How
much is it going to cost you to start the business you’ve dreamed of?
In 2009, the Kauffmann Foundation estimated that the average start-up cost was
approximately $30,000. The truth is that no business is the same and many
micro-businesses can get started for as little as $3,000 or less, but this is
still a sizable cost. These businesses are often home-based sole
proprietorships with low upfront investments. Another low-cost option is a
franchise. 
While your average Main Street franchise may require a larger
investment, home-based franchises can be started with as little as
$1,000-$5,000, but with Craftolia.com you can still. – This fact prompted us to
dig deeper into a solution, where people can sell their items without these
large fees.  This is where we started to
envision “Craftolia.com” and all the possible benefits we could bring to people:

Global platform

Social sharing options
Low start up costs
User friendly functions

When reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us
that this is a business that needs to be created. We feel if executed properly
we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier way to sell.  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the industry. 
This paired with attention to detail and quality service will make us a
key player if not leader in the industry of online sales platforms. Our mission
is to take care of every funder, supporter and customer with the upmost respect
and care.  We feel this will be the key to our growth.

</div></div>","Who I am and what I want to do
Hello world! I'm Leonardo. I am 26 and I come from Italy. During my life I have been several times abroad for studying and working, and I have seen how young people can build up their own career without any problem. It is on my passion, international communication, that I'd like to work. I want to start this campaign to build awareness on this project on . I would also like to raise some money to make my dream real: To build a company that will be able to successfully work in the communication field.


I have already, on my own, built a website, that will son host a free blog. I've also launched a Twitter account and I am now bringing the logo (a home made one) on other social platforms. The idea it's a seed: that is why I need a small help from several good-hearted people: like a seed, it needs time and love to grow. The long-term perspective is to build a startup company working in the field of Public Relations and institutional communication.


You, as a contributor to my self-employment project can benefit the most from this campaign: you can be gifted from being one of the first believers in this idea. Good karma, and a lot of gratitude by me and my future colleagues. You can also get some small tastes of what it means to be on this side, in the form of simple perks that you can see on this page. They are all simple, and seem unrelated, but each of them represent, small parts of what I am today, and what I would like to bring to the business!








I need your support.. What do You Get?


To start, I have planned to spend around 1,500 Euro for the blog, considering that nothing from that amount will be for my personal pocket.


They will be spent on building the structure of blog, consulting services and, of course, paying taxes and related costs. I will take care of communicating the idea and of establishing the brand (as I have already started to do on social media). Depending on the total funds received I will also create an online story-board documenting all the major steps accomplished.


My perks are part of my world. I do not have great things to offer, that is why I opted for small things, that often require some of my time to deliver. They are part of what I like. I hope you enjoy my choice. Please, feel free to ask for something, even if it is not included. Looking forward to preparing them for shipment!


 If I don't reach my entire goal, all funds will come back directly to the funders (""believers""). :) 
So, you do not loose even a single penny! 

The Impact

My startup project is essentially built around the idea of launching a Public Relations company, that can measures, within the first years, with great European competitors.

That is exactly what I do not want to see, being that the reason why I want to run a business through this project.

Challenges of my project

I know the journey will be long, but, as today, I will ask to conscious and more qualified people to help me out in this project. That's also why I opted to start with just the idea of a Blog.
I will also take personally care of keeping you, nice community of lovers, well informed on my steps: as I said before, I need help, but, most of all, I need to build a community of believers in this idea.
There are no major risks for you (except receiving a wrong-sized t-shirt). And i must say, I see no major risks for me as well. I will need to work hard, and keep my mind focused on my original idea.

<b><h1>Where did you last buy everything you need for your Soirée?</h1></b><p>When it comes to planning your next big event, many stores
lack in their ability to meet all your needs in one place. You’re likely to
find a store for your gifts, a shop for your rental décor, and another for all
your floral needs. If you’re lucky, sometimes two of these are combined.  Not to mention, when it comes to those
beautiful blooms, the limited options are disappointing. Grocery bunches or
overpriced arrangements, are often all that’s available and not at all what you

<br/>In early 2014 Parlour Soirée was born. Created by the hands
of Amanda Seymour as a home-based Styling and Blooms service business.  After a successful wedding season, and
a desire to have a retail location, a pretty awesome opportunity fell in her
hands in January 2015.  Amanda
leased a 700 square foot studio in Conestogo and took to renovating the space.
<br/>
<p>With the desire to be a community involved 
business, serving the communities needs, filling in the gaps for a quality custom product and service in a budget friendly and convenient way, the aha moment come to what is now Parlour 
Soirée Inc. today as a Bespoke Life Soirée Shop™. Since 
then, we've been working hard to make this dream a reality. <br/></p>

<br/> We began
 intensive research and planning.  The <b>Start Up Company</b>  provided a training program to Amanda to help develop the vision, market research, a 
business plan and pitch, marketing development, assigned a mentor and ultimately helped us develop a simulated Bespoke Life Soirée Shop™.   We've also been learning from customers and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive!<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Parlour Soirée™ has started renovations. Designing a layout
for optimal service, efficiently knocking down and rebuilding a wall, removing

<h1>Financial Roadmap<br/>
</h1>
<br/>
<p>Amanda has invested everything 
she has in getting this creative, one of a kind studio 
prepared for the  all the Soirée Lovers in Southern Ontario – now we need your help to give the business its last jumpstart!
 To date, we've pooled saved money, worked hard &amp;  endless hours in jobs we were not so keen on and took out some financing to purchase supplies, business expenses (including the legal stuff), obtained our studio and started to get
 it outfitted for the Soirée. 
All to make this dream become a reality. 
<br/></p>
<ul>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Amanda has invested over $75,000 in the business 
and needs $7,750 more to get us on the road to sending out invitations for our Grand Soirée™! 
. This campaign is ""all or nothing"" - if we do not hit our $5000 goal we do not  get
 to keep any pledges as all pledges are returned to the donor!! Help us reach at least 5k and spread love, happiness and Soirée Style™ across Southern Ontario.</p>
<p></p>

sweet positive reinforcement starting at just $10. If only 500 Soirée Lovers bought a swag bag, we would be fully funded and ready to get the Soirée started!<br/><br/><p></p>

for optimal service, efficiently knocking down and rebuilding a wall, removing
the carpet, fixing electrical, and plumbing for better ease of service and flow
and installing a magnificent reclaimed pallet floor.



Still on the agenda for Parlour Soirée™ are; plans to build
custom counters from reclaimed doors and lumber, a stunning custom walk in
cooler--it's easier to fit lumber through a door than a pre-build cooler!



(Opps...the picture is side ways! This is our floral cooler to be)
   

Financial Roadmap


Amanda has invested everything 
she has in getting this creative, one of a kind studio 
prepared for the  all the Soirée Lovers in Southern Ontario – now we need your help to give the business its last jumpstart!
 To date, we've pooled saved money, worked hard &  endless hours in jobs we were not so keen on and took out some financing to purchase supplies, business expenses (including the legal stuff), obtained our studio and started to get
 it outfitted for the Soirée. 
All to make this dream become a reality. 





Amanda has invested over $75,000 in the business 
and needs $7,750 more to get us on the road to sending out invitations for our Grand Soirée™! 
. This campaign is ""all or nothing"" - if we do not hit our $5000 goal we do not  get
 to keep any pledges as all pledges are returned to the donor!! Help us reach at least 5k and spread love, happiness and Soirée Style™ across Southern Ontario.

We appreciate anything that you can give - even $1! We're offering some 
sweet positive reinforcement starting at just $10. If only 500 Soirée Lovers bought a swag bag, we would be fully funded and ready to get the Soirée started!


Is there a perk you would like us to add?  Let us know and we will make a custom perk just for you!Challenges & Opportunities Our brand concept is new and unique, as with anything different, risk is always present. Yet, this unique concept, with its all in one approach, offers ease and relaxing to what can be stressful for many. Parlour Soirée™ also has the ability to create any style and therefore, can work with everybody and their individual and unique visions. 
Overall, our biggest challenge is getting the word out so people in Southern Ontario know Parlour Soirée™ is launching its first Bespoke Life Soirée Shop™ – help us spread the 
word and put people on the look-out for us!  
Be sure to use the social media share buttons at the top of the page!We thank you soo much for being apart of the Soirée with us!  Much love, Parlour Soirée xx",8.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creator: Dr. James Ligon<br/>Location: Humble, Texas<br/>Bio: I have been practicing dentistry for almost 20 years and have worked with a dental supply company for over 10 years.<br/>Advanced Degree(s): DDS, MA</li>
<li>Our dentist-formulated toothpaste will not include harmful substances such as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Ethylene Glycol, Fluoride, Titanium Dioxide or Glycerin. We are including natural agents such as turmeric and black seed oil and others that have been proven to be strong inflammatory antagonists. Our goal is to have a toothpaste that is not only good for the teeth and gums but also beneficial to the rest of the body at a fair, affordable price.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $35,000 to achieve our goal...our costs include product, website, storage facility, marketing, research and insurance.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we achieve full funding it will be used for the manufacture of 20,000 to 30,000 tubes of our toothpaste as well as ongoing marketing and testing of our product at a local school of dental hygiene for efficacy. </li>
<li>If we achieve a surplus in funding we will be able to develop another product centered around ""oil-pulling"".</li>
<li>If our full funding goals are not achieved we will probably only be able to manufacture less than 10,000 and have a very limited budget for marketing.</li>
<li>We will be able to deliver, of course, our product and tooth brushes.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are not just asking for funds to make some type of toothpaste to sell but we are asking for help to provide a healthy alternative to people that want a toothpaste which contains natural entities that have been scientifically proven to provide benefit to the body as a whole.  Help us change lives for the better.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We believe that our greatest challenge will be marketing our product.</p>
<p>We intend to overcome the hurdle by initiating multiple distribution channels including but not limited to:</p>
<p>Direct to consumer</p>
<p>Affiliate Marketing</p>
<p>MLM</p>
<p>Chain grocery and drug stores</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>These days money is tight for most of us.  If you can't provide financial support please spread the word about out campaign to others.</p>

Q-Safe is a keying with 3 QR codes that help keep people
with Learning Disabilities, Dementia and other cognitive difficulties safe.
Q-safe also provides family, friends and loved ones with peace of mind. Q-Safe
is bespoke to each person using our secure system and works simply by scanning
with a Smart Device.

Each QR code completes a different task when scanned with
our QR code reader App and works across all Smart Devices. When scanned by
the user Q-Safe can:

Call their chosen Next of Kin


Text their location to their chosen Next of Kin


Display their chosen ‘about me’ information









How does it help people with Learning Disabilities, Dementia and
associated cognitive difficulties?Why us?Inclusive Media Solutions was founded in September 2013 by
William Britton and specialises in mobile technology for the cognitive
disability community. Prior to founding Inclusive Media Solutions Will spent 5 years as a Further Education lecturer of students with Learning Disabilities
and Assistive Technology specialist. Passionate about cognitive disabilities
but annoyed by the lack of effective mobile technology products and expert advice in the community Will created Inclusive Media Solutions to fill this void.







                                                         Why a key ring?
We know from experience that people with cognitive
disabilities get lost or confused about where they are; this can lead to them
being anxious and scared. Q-Safe is discreet and can be kept on them at all times and is simply
initiated by the users Smart Device. With your help we will be able to make Q-Safe weatherpoof



Is it safe?
With years of experience working with vulnerable people we
know that safeguarding is essential. Q-Safe is a custom developed system; if
the user looses or misplaces their key ring we can simply disable it centrally
from our system. This deactivates the keyring and a new one can be distributed to the user.




Scanning Q-Safe is easy!
To scan the Q-Safe key ring we have developed a FREE app available
on iOS and Android devices. Our App is a ‘scan and go’ QR code scanner designed
for simplicity and ease of use, ideal for people with Learning Disabilities,
Dementia and other cognitive difficulties. With your help we will be able to further develop this App to support Q-Safe across various mobile platforms




Where will the funds go?
We have been working on our prototype for 6 months, we’ve
worked with our target market on looks, functionality, safety and ease of use.
We now need your help to overcome the final hurdle and make our prototype ready
for commercial use. Your support will help tens of thousands of vulnerable
people keep safe. We will use the funds on the following areas:



QR system development - Custom system set up on our safe and secure server 

App development - Ensure compatibility with Q-Safe and testing
Materials and distribution - Plastic casing on keyring for weatherproofing and durability. Distribution of product to Perk 4
Final stage testing - With a variety of ages across the market to gather further primary feedback
Website development: Update website showing product, graphics and information. 






Why people with cognitive disabilities need your help
Mobile technology is revolutionising the
way we interact with the world and it’s changing all our lives for the better.
It’s important we understand how mobile technology can help people with
Learning Disabilities, Dementia and associated cognitive difficulties by
providing them with innovative solutions to the independence they deserve.

<b>Background</b>
</h2><p>Modern companies, large and small,
are under pressure to provide more efficient services and interfaces
where customers can self-serve, and this often puts information at
risk. The Public Sector is also affected, with healthcare suffering frequent breaches.</p>
<p>We all would benefit from a world where people can get on with
doing good business with confidence in their connected
applications, and vendors should have comfort that the solution that they
have installed is up to the job.
</p>
<h2>
<b>The evidence</b>
</h2><p>A quick<a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=erp+vulnerabilities"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> search on google for ERP vulnerabilities</a> should provide enough evidence of the impact of the issues, and the <a href=""https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/data-breach-trends/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Information Commissioners office (ICO) is reporting</a> a sustained level of registered breaches despite increased profile of the issues and investments in systems. 

</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435406773/e01iyjwkxhrfegdphbri.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>ERPScan <a href=""http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2015ams/materials/D1T2%20-%20Alexey%20Tiurin%20-%20Oracle%20Peoplesoft%20Applications%20are%20Under%20Attack.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">released a paper in 2015</a>
 describing some real issues with mainstream ERP packages, including 
demonstrations and examples. PWC report that the scale and cost of 
breaches has doubled in<a href=""http://www.pwc.co.uk/audit-assurance/publications/2015-information-security-breaches-survey.jhtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> their 2015 survey</a> and the UK Government are urging business to do more in a<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-urges-business-to-take-action-as-cost-of-cyber-security-breaches-doubles"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> press release </a>of June 2015.<b><br/><br/>What do I intend to do about it?</b><br/><br/>
<p>The traditional ERP industry seems averse to engaging in public 
conversations about
security, often suggesting that it is an issue with the platform, not
the application, or offering costly solutions. Therefore, it becomes 
risky and expensive to build services that consumers demand and 
suppliers aspire to.
</p><p>Surprisingly, many of the best solutions are also the simplest
and least costly. To achieve an acceptable level of security, there are 
many areas of concern including networking, applications,
training, culture, physical and remote access. It is not feasible to
assess everything for everyone, but at the least, we need to find an
application that can pass some basic tests to give an implementation
a fighting chance to be secure.</p>
<p>I have worked with software applications critical to businesses for
over 20 years, and have seen some serious problems waiting to happen,
as much as I can see some really good implementations. For the last 15 years, I have been running <a href=""http://opusvl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OpusVL</a> - a company that implements enterprise Open Source solutions.
</p><p>The industry needs to step up to the demands of small and large 
business, but it is not easy to make an impact with the big ERP vendors.
 <a href=""http://odoo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Odoo</a> 
(previously known as OpenERP) is feature-rich and <b>Open Source</b>, I 
think this is the best place to start, and the benefits of crowd funded 
improvements can be felt by anyone who chooses to download it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435408098/g7f0ixdkb8avkjxbwoqx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I have decided to launch this crowd funding project to raise the 
profile of the issues, and professionally and credibly deliver real 
solutions through the Odoo application.
</p><p><b>Does this <i>really</i> affect you?</b>
</p><p>Before you think to yourself that this does not affect you,
consider how many companies hold your data or provide you with
services across the public and private sectors. Do you assume that their systems are secure? Have you ever
asked? What would you ask anyway? 
</p><p>You need them to be secure as much
as they do - help me raise the bar for security across business 
applications. By funding this project, Odoo will have a formal security 
assessment and set the new bar, we will have raised the profile of the 
issues and other ERP vendors will not be able to ignore it.</p>
<p><b>Has this been done before?</b>
</p><p>There are many cases where crowd funding and collaborations have been
 used to check and improve the security of popular Open Source software.
</p><p>ITPortal write <a href=""http://www.itproportal.com/2015/04/17/open-source-crowd-funding-best-way-prevent-future-security-flaws/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>
 about how Crowd Funding is a good way to address the security of Open 
Source software. ZDNet report on the funding of security audits for key 
Open Source applications <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/article/corporations-put-their-cash-where-their-open-source-security-is/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and a report by the Telegraph <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/10785665/Tech-firms-to-fund-open-source-projects-following-Heartbleed-crisis.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. An article <a href=""https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2013/09/15/google-funding-of-open-source-security-projects/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> from the University of Cambridge describes some of the work they have done on community funded projects.</p>
<p><b>Why now?</b></p>The instances of data leak, attacks and breaches 
are growing yet businesses need to improve productivity by implementing 
more software, much of this in the ""cloud"". The marketplace is growing, 
security is not keeping up.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/01/27/five-catalysts-accelerating-cloud-erp-growth-in-2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Forbes report</a>
 on the PWC prediction that cloud connected business software revenue 
will more than double by 2016 to $78Bn, it is likely that something that
 holds your data will be affected.<br/><br/>Open Source has matured, it 
exists in almost every piece of modern technology, from home devices 
such as phones, TV's and smart homes, to enterprise IT, cars and 
machines; the credibility and usefulness is no longer in question.<br/><br/>The impact of this audit will enable greater use of Odoo including banking &amp; finance and the Public Sector.<br/><br/>
<h3>The project</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise £10,000 to commission <a href=""https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NCC Group</a>
 to test the
features of Odoo. OpusVL will provision the Odoo software, create 
documentation to be released back to the Odoo project and manage the 
overall project. The team at OpusVL are focussed on Open Source and 
business. They have managed various projects with NCC previously and 
have worked with Odoo for nearly a decade. NCC have tested many business
 applications and Open Source software.</p>
<p>A technical overview of the project can be found below, along with more details of the people involved.</p>
<p>Once the funding project has completed, the test will
commence. It is anticipated that the process will be complete within
4 weeks and reports issued in line with the levels of sponsorship. 
</p><p><b>What will the funding be used for?</b></p>

<br/><h3>Ready to go
</h3><p>To prepare for this project, I have the following in place: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Full support and co-operation of
	Odoo SA – The editor of the Odoo ERP software</p>
</li>

</li>
</ol>
<p><i><b>- All that is needed now is to raise the funds</b></i>
<br/></p><h3>What will I do with £10,000?<br/>
</h3><p>If I reach my target of £10,000, I will be able to launch a formal security audit of Odoo by NCC Group, and from the learnings of the audit, create documentation for the community to benefit from.</p><p>We will have achieved a baseline security understanding of Odoo.<br/></p><h4>Engagement of NCC Group</h4><p>NCC Group will provide a security audit in consultation with the partners sponsoring the project.

<p>I have selected NCC Group as they are globally recognised as a software security
leader, respected by Governments and corporates alike. As one of the
largest providers of penetration and security testing in Europe, they have a wide range of penetration testing skills, including
social engineering attacks. The company claims to be 100% ethical where all
testers undergo rigorous vetting. 
</p>
<p>Although I have invited NCC to undertake this project, they are
acting independently, NCC have no ties to any commercial suppliers including Odoo and OpusVL.
They boast full ISO/IEC 27001 certification and hold the CESG CHECK
accreditation and have numerous CLAS personnel. 
</p>
<p>NCC Group is an active member of CREST, the standards-based
organisation for penetration test suppliers, aimed at ensuring
highest standards of leading-edge security testing and hold both
Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) and Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)
for the PCI DSS and PA-DSS compliance.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435395051/rzumogmes0xxx2gphwa1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Back in 2006, I selected what was then TinyERP, now Odoo, to be the
Open Source ERP platform to build upon. Although Version 3 was rough
round the edges, it was built on an extensible and robust framework,
the only one of it's kind. I was sure that it would ultimately
challenge the marketplace, and it seems that the time has now come.
Odoo have created the next generation ERP software. 
</p>
<p>Based on implementing best practice web methods within their ERP
application, they are able to achieve the flexibility, performance
and security of a web based system, with the functionality of an ERP
(and lots more). I believe that Odoo is already probably one of the
most secure ERP systems, but I want to test this theory further and
evidence this. Many legacy ERP applications are shamefully inadequate 
when it comes to security, Odoo is already very promising, but
this needs to be proven. 

</p><p>Odoo operate a ""<a href=""https://www.odoo.com/page/responsible-disclosure%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">responsible disclosure</a>"" programme for
security reports, meaning that anyone submitting a report must agree
not to share it until a patch is released, the enterprise customers
have been notified, and a reasonable period of time has passed for
remedial work before public announcements are made.</p>
Odoo are now one of Europe's fastest growing companies, and
recently been visited by the European Commission when they launched
their 315€Bn business growth fund - details here:<a href=""https://www.odoo.com/page/press-release-european-commission-visit"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> https://www.odoo.com/page/press-release-european-commission-visit</a><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435397585/mprlqakhw71aqya2o38m.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>OpusVL have worked with Odoo since V3.3 both internally and for
clients, and has installed one of Europe’s largest installations.
Modules are created on a daily basis and advanced functionality is
regularly implemented. The company has robust project management
methodologies blended with flexible processes. <br/>Operating their own
hosting environments and having been on the receiving end of NCC
security audits for high-profile clients on numerous occasions, this
project can be managed effectively and efficiently by the team.<br/><br/>The team implement Odoo for real businesses so are close to the
contemporary issues faced, and hear the questions asked by users and
business leaders alike, making them ideally suited to manage the
project. OpusVL is committed to Open Source communities and employs
staff that share this ethos.<br/><br/>OpusVL development staff routinely look for bugs and improvements
for Odoo as well as the other Open Source applications they work
with. Issues are reported to the code maintainers and where patches
have been created, these are submitted to the application code
repositories. In most cases, Odoo accept issues filed by OpusVL and bring them
in to the main code base.<br/><br/><p>Some recent reports by OpusVL relate to SQL injections, session ID
hijacking and cross site scripting bugs. These generally require a
level of privilege on the system already, but never the less, are
undesirable. The view from the OpusVL team is that Odoo are designing
software with security as a first principle and are ready to accept
security reports, this project will further refine their processes. OpusVL will manage this project under my guidance.<br/><br/>

</h2></a>
<h3>
What if the project is over-funded?</h3>
<p>There is lots to do, As explained in the stretch goals, the test
can be widened across modules, and across versions. There is an
excellent network of partners around the globe who have skills to
extend the project if needed. There is no upper level that cannot be
put to good use to support the objectives of the project. 
</p>
<h3>
Does this make my implementation of Odoo secure?</h3>
<p>No, this is focussed on the application, you will still need to
use good practice when implementing it for yourself, and ensure you
have a culture of security within the organisation. You may want to
commission your own security test once you have implemented Odoo.
With this project, you know the state of the Odoo application which
will reduce  the scope of risk. 
</p>
<h3>Why
is it not secure anyway?</h3>
<p>I do not believe any connected system is ""secure"", it is
levels of insecurity. Risk is determined by how hard someone will try
to get at what you have. Most front doors are not secure, but most
people do not have things worth the risk of stealing. If they do,
they fit an alarm, and the house with the weakest security becomes the 
target. However, if you happen to have a very smart house,
with lots of nice tech in the front window, you may want to increase
security. Technology is the same, we need to make sure the level of
security is appropriate for the use of the software, and the methods
of access are understood.</p>
<p>This project is intended to raise funds to validate the level of security of
the Odoo application, and use the balance to repair issues in
priority order. 
</p>
<h3>
Why don't Odoo commission the audit?</h3>
<p>Firstly security testing must be undertaken independently, it is
more credible if the audit was commissioned externally. Secondly,
Odoo make their full suite of software available at no cost. It would
cost millions to replicate so they are already giving a great deal by
allowing any one of us to use it for free. 
</p>
<h3>
Is Open Source more or less secure?</h3>
<p>The fact that software is Open Source does not affect the
level of security it provides. However, Open Source has the benefit that many
users can see how it really works which enables issues to be found,
best practice to be implemented and fixes made. Closed-source
software relies on the internal development teams finding issues and
fixing them. Sometimes software becomes stable, and no-one has an
interest in updating it, with Open Source, if you have an interest,
you can choose to fix it. 
</p>
<p>If Odoo was not Open Source, we would not be able to do a
meaningful test anyway, and if we did, we would not be empowered to
fix it. 
</p>
<h3>
Does publishing security defects enable rogues to break in?</h3>
<p>No. It informs the users of the software that issues have been
found, and provides a way to resolve them. Information is not
released to the public for a short time, called the responsible
disclosure period, this is typically a few weeks. Hiding security
issues generally only benefits people who are trying to break in. 
</p>
<h3>
Surely I should expect Odoo to fix the software for free?</h3>
<p>The Odoo application is Open Source - you get the benefit of
millions of pounds of investment, shared by many who have designed
and developed the software. By using the software for free, you
cannot expect the value-added professional services of a security
audit. Odoo provide an optional Enterprise contract which includes
bug fixes when found. Any patches found through this process will be
fed through the Enterprise process. Users of the Free Odoo
application will find benefit from the improvements from the standard
repositories but will have to help themselves or engage a
knowledgeable company to install them. 
</p>
<h3>
Is Odoo considered more or less secure than other ERP software?</h3>
<p>The ERP industry sets a low bar for security, we believe the
starting position for Odoo is already much higher than the
competition, however, we want to prove this. 
</p>
<h3>So what else is Odoo doing to improve security?</h3>
<p>Odoo already process many security reports every year and take it
very seriously. This will be evidenced shortly when they launch a
project on <a href=""https://hackerone.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://hackerone.com/</a></p>
<h3>
What happens when a new version of Odoo is released?</h3>
<p>Any patches created will be applicable to future versions of Odoo,
and in most cases, will also apply to previous versions.</p>
<h3>
What are other ERP providers doing?</h3>
<p>Sadly, not enough. More and more businesses rely on ERP systems to 
run
their day to day operations, their security concerns are sometimes 
resolved by costly bespoke fixes instead of improving the core 
platforms.

</p>
<h3>
How will I get access to the fixes?</h3>
<p>All patches and issues detected will be sent to Odoo in line with their
standard ""Responsible Disclosure"" reporting policy. These are usually published by Odoo within a few
weeks, once all enterprise customers have had sufficient notice.
</p><h3>
Where will the output of this project be found?</h3>
<p>The code and patches will be available on GitHub (the on-line code 
version control repository) along with the Odoo core code. Information 
will be submitted to the Odoo documentation and user guides will become 
available to the public in due course. <br/></p><h3>
Who will own the code and documentation?</h3>
<p>All of the work generated through this project will be released
under Open Source / Creative Commons licenses for the benefit of the
communities. 
</p>
<h3>Is this for
everyone?</h3>
<p>It may not be for you<b> if you do not have any data that is
important enough to store securely</b>, or if you feel that the systems
that hold your data are flexible and secure enough already. Even so,
you may feel that it is worth investing to help others reach a level
of security that they can be comfortable with.

<a name=""TechnicalOverview"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <h2>Stretch 1: The Full audit plan - Technical overview
</h2>
</a>
<p>If the campaign generates £25,000, a full audit will be carried out as detailed here.</p><p><b>Key objectives</b>
</p><p>From the independent verification, a report will be created: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>any weaknesses that may be
	present, which an attacker aiming to compromise the confidentiality,
	integrity, or availability of data contained within an Odoo
	implementation and data could exploit 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the threats facing information
	assets within Odoo so that the level of risk can be quantified and
	addressed, and adequate expenditure provided 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that an Odoo user's security
	expectations and requirements are being met 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that a thorough and comprehensive penetration test covering
	policy, procedure, design, and implementation has occurred 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
To adopt best practice by conforming to legal and industry
regulations, NCC Group will analyse any weaknesses detected, evaluate
the impact and probability of exploitation associated with each
security weakness, formulate corrective actions, and provide
recommendations for mitigating the risks associated with the
vulnerability.<br/>
<p>The test Odoo is Version 8 installed on an up to date Debian
platform. It has the base set of standard modules installed
including: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CRM 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sales order 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchase order 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accounting &amp; finance 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Base web builder with contact form 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if target is met, the top 3 ""stretch modules"" will be included.

</p><p>The following components are within the scope of the testing: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Login pages, both web and admin 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>URL's 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database admin 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>API 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An assessment will take place of these modules to identify
security vulnerabilities that may be exploited to compromise either
the server-side application or ordinary users of the application. The
assessment will involve the following broad areas of work: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recon and analysis - mapping of
	the application's content and functionality, analyse its behaviour,
	identify all possible entry points for user input, and develop a
	clear understanding of the attack surface exposed by the application
		</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment of access handling -
	testing of the application's core security mechanisms, including
	authentication, session management, and access control, to identify
	any defects that may enable an attacker to gain unauthorised access
	to functionality and data 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment of input handling -
	test of the application's resilience to numerous kinds of unexpected
	input throughout its functionality, looking for code injection and
	other vulnerabilities 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment of application logic - probing for defects within
	the application's logic, including inappropriate reliance on
	client-side controls and logic flaws within server-side
	functionality 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary areas of concern in web application security are
authentication bypass, injection, account traversal, privilege
escalation, and data extraction. 
</p>
<p>The testing methodology covers all of the OWASP top ten web
application security risks and more: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A1: Injection 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A2: Broken Authentication and
	Session Management 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
	</p>
</li>

	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A5: Security Misconfiguration 
	</p>

	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A10: Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Web application assessments will be performed on the target Odoo
application remotely. The purpose of the assessment is to identify
any vulnerabilities which can be exploited in order to attack the
system or other users, bypass controls, escalate privileges, or
extract sensitive data. 
</p>
<p>During the assessment the consultants will use proven non-invasive
testing techniques to quickly identify any weaknesses. The
application is viewed and manipulated from several perspectives,
including with no credentials, user credentials, and privileged user
credentials. 
</p>
<h3>Test details</h3>
<p>The following tests will be included. 
</p>
<h4>Unvalidated Input</h4>
<p>Where information from web requests is not validated before being
used by a web application, an attacker could use this flaw to access
and attack the supporting back-end components or other users.
Examples of this type of attack include cross-site scripting, SQL
injection, OS command injection, and SOAP injection. 
</p>
<h4>Broken Access
Control</h4>
<p>Access control restrictions determine what authenticated users are
allowed to do in a web application. When they are not properly
enforced an attacker can exploit these flaws to access other users’
accounts, view sensitive files, or use unauthorised functions. 
</p>
<h4>
Broken Authentication and Session Management</h4>
<p>When account credentials and session tokens are not properly
protected, an attacker can exploit these weaknesses in order to
defeat authentication restrictions and assume other users’
identities. Session hijacking can be achieved when a valid session
token is exploited to gain unauthorised access to information or
services in a computer system. Session tokens are normally randomised
or encrypted to prevent session hijacking. Cookies are supposed to be
stored and sent back to the server unchanged, but an attacker can
modify their values. The process of tampering with the value of
cookies is called cookie poisoning, and is sometimes used after
cookie theft to make an attack persistent. When a user logs in to an
application, they usually supply a user ID or username and password
to access it. It is possible for an attacker to discover the user ID
and, with one part of the authentication taken care of, to run a
brute-force attack which attempts to match a library of words to the
password. 
</p>
<h4>
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Flaws</h4>
<p>This occurs when the web application can be used as a mechanism to
transport an attack to an end-user’s browser. A successful attack
could disclose the end-user’s session token, attack the local
machine, or spoof content to fool the user. An attacker can exploit
these vulnerabilities by creating a malicious link or writing
malicious code into a web application. 
</p>
<h4>Buffer Overflows</h4>
<p>Some web application server-side components may be vulnerable to
buffer overflow attacks. A remote attacker may be able to provide
specially-crafted malicious input which causes the components to
crash and, in some cases, can lead to remote code execution. The
affected components are usually drivers, CGI, libraries, and web
application server components. 
</p>
<h4>Injection Flaws</h4>
<p>Web applications often pass parameters or arguments between the
application and the OS or external system. If an attacker can embed
malicious commands in these parameters, the external system may
execute those commands on behalf of the web application. Most
frequently this attack uses SQL or LDAP. SQL injection is the
inputting of malicious SQL commands to the web front-end presentation
service. SQL injection is possible on applications which dynamically
create content on the server via a call to a SQL server (Oracle,
MS-SQL, MySQL etc.). A lack of filtering on the client-side data
input can allow an attacker to delimit the existing SQL query and
append additional SQL. This means that any value which can be
manipulated by the client may be vulnerable, including hidden values
and parameters passed in both GET and POST HTTP requests. 
</p>
<h4>Improper
Error Handling</h4>
<p>There are instances where error conditions occur during normal
operations and are not handled properly. If an attacker can identify
the errors that the web application fails to handle correctly, they
can systematically force those errors, revealing system information. 
</p>
<h4>Insecure Storage</h4>
<p>Storing information such as credentials usually involves
cryptography. Integrating cryptography into a web application can be
complex, and as a result there are often deficiencies in its
execution. When the cryptographic function is not coded properly, or
is not integrated appropriately, information is not protected. 
</p>
<h4>Denial of Service</h4>
<p>An attacker can survey an application to determine what processes
use the most resources. With this knowledge it is possible to consume
web application resources to a point where legitimate users can no
longer access or use the application. In extreme cases the
application can be knocked over and cease functioning completely. 
</p>
<h4>Insecure
Configuration Management</h4>
<p>Having a strong server configuration standard is critical to a
secure web application. These servers have many configuration options
that affect security and are not secure out of the box. Configuration
management ensures that any box being built from new has the correct
security configuration and administration settings for its
environment and purpose. 
</p>
<h3>Detailed
Methodology</h3>
<p>An in-depth and thorough assessment of in-scope web applications
will be performed to ensure that correct configuration and
recommended practices have been followed to minimise client exposure.
The following is a sample list of common tests that are performed
when carrying out an application test. It will vary depending on the
technology and protocols that have been implemented. 
</p>
<h4>Web Server
Specific</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify known vulnerabilities
	related to the web server version. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess configuration issues. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search for default web server
	content. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify information leakage. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locate information hidden within
	field variables of HTML forms and comments. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examine information contained in banners, usage instructions,
	help messages, and error messages. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find a possible brute-force
	password guessing point in the application. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find valid login credentials with
	password grinding. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review lockout policy for failed
	attempts 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review lockout timeout 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assess use of generic
	authentication error messages, preventing username enumeration. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bypass authentication with spoofed
	tokens. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bypass authentication with replay
	of authentication information. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the application logic to
	maintain authentication sessions, such as number of failures, logins
	allowed, and login timeouts. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the limitations of access control in the
	applications – access permissions, login session duration, and
	idle duration. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Input
Manipulation</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find limitations of defined
	variables and protocol payload, data length and type, construct
	format. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use exceptionally long character
	strings to find buffer overflow vulnerability in applications. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concatenate commands in the input
	strings of the applications. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inject SQL language in the input
	strings of database-tied web applications. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examine cross-site scripting
	opportunities in the web application. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examine unauthorised directory or
	file access with path and directory traversal. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manipulate session or persistent
	cookies. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manipulate the (hidden) field
	variable in the HTML forms. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manipulation of HTTP fields such
	as “Referrer” and “Host”.

<li>
<p>Determine the protocol specification of the server or client
	application. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Deduce the program logic from error or debug messages in
application outputs and from program behaviours and performance. By
forcing the application to generate errors, useful information can be
gained about the logic of the program 
</p>
<h4>Session
Management</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determine session management
	information – number of concurrent sessions, IP-based
	authentication, role-based authentication, identity-based
	authentication, cookie usage, and session ID in hidden HTML field
	variables. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimate session ID sequence and
	format. 
	</p>

	maintained with IP address information; check if the same
	information can be retrieved on another machine. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather excessive information with
	direct URL, direct instruction, action sequence jumping, or page
	skipping. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replay gathered information to
	fool applications.

</li>
<li>
<p>Check if commercially-proven
	session tokens such as ASP.NET_SessionID or JSESSIONID are in use. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure session variables are kept
	server side. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check for validation, cookie
	re-injection, and cookie manipulation. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure session tokens are not
	mixed with authentication tokens. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure authentication cookies are
	non-persistent. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if a session timeout is
	enforced. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check simultaneous login
	functionality 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the user session is
	deleted on logout. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure the client-server communication channel is adequately
	secured for its intended use. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Language
and Application Specific</h4>

	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retrieve valuable information stored in temporary files and
	object. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>Stretch 2: - Source code review</h3>
<p>All software, no matter how well-written, has bugs. These bugs
can, if an attacker becomes aware of them, become a vector for
attack. 
</p>
<p>It is difficult for even the most skilled programmers to see the
flaws in their own work, and an outside review of the code will often
turn up potentially-dangerous vulnerabilities that have been missed
by the development team. 
</p>
<p>With a professional code review, the number of vulnerabilities in
your software will be minimised, and thus the opportunities for
attackers to use your product for malicious purposes. 
</p>
<p>NCC Group’s consultants have a vast knowledge of security issues
relevant to web applications, with experience in all common web
programming languages and frameworks, as well as all major servers. 
</p>
<p>While automated tools are used to find common vulnerabilities, the
bulk of the work will involve the consultants manually analysing the
source code and configuration files for the application, with special
attention being paid to those areas of the code which interact with
the database, implement error-handling functionality, involve login
and session management, or are otherwise likely to contain
vulnerabilities. 
</p>
<p>The review will lead to a full report, with details of all issues
found and suggestions for mitigation. This activity will give you the
assurance you need that your application is free from common
vulnerabilities, and that data within the application is secure. 
</p>
<p>If the project is over funded, a revised test plan will be
provided to all funders. The methodology will be the same, but the
scope will be increased to cover more modules. Stretch module votes
will be counted and modules will be tested in order of votes. 
</p>
<p>As the test is only directed at the application, the platform will
not become part of the assessment. For this reason, it should not
matter what operating system is used, and Debian is our preference
for ease of implementation. 
</p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>Stretch 3: Logical testing 
</h3>
<p>The logical make-up of the application is assessed from a
completely unauthenticated stand point to make sure the application
is not vulnerable to misuse in all forms. 
</p>
<h3>Reporting</h3>

I have created this Indiegogo campaign to raise money for a security test of Odoo by NCC Group. 
Odoo is the fastest growing business management ERP software (and it is Open Source too), and NCC Group are a world leader in software security testing.In line with the Odoo responsible Disclosure policy, all issues reported and addressed will be reported on their page  here: https://www.odoo.com/page/responsible-disclosure and patches will be released. The Partner perk is to bring you in to the NDA during the process.Confirmed issues will be published on the Odoo Github security issues page here. I will be working with Odoo and partners to use the funds raised in the most effective way to get the best from this campaign.If you care about the way people store your data within their businesses, you should read on.
Background
Modern companies, large and small,
are under pressure to provide more efficient services and interfaces
where customers can self-serve, and this often puts information at
risk. The Public Sector is also affected, with healthcare suffering frequent breaches.
We all would benefit from a world where people can get on with
doing good business with confidence in their connected
applications, and vendors should have comfort that the solution that they
have installed is up to the job.


The evidence
A quick search on google for ERP vulnerabilities should provide enough evidence of the impact of the issues, and the Information Commissioners office (ICO) is reporting a sustained level of registered breaches despite increased profile of the issues and investments in systems. 

ERPScan released a paper in 2015
 describing some real issues with mainstream ERP packages, including 
demonstrations and examples. PWC report that the scale and cost of 
breaches has doubled in their 2015 survey and the UK Government are urging business to do more in a press release of June 2015.What do I intend to do about it?
The traditional ERP industry seems averse to engaging in public 
conversations about
security, often suggesting that it is an issue with the platform, not
the application, or offering costly solutions. Therefore, it becomes 
risky and expensive to build services that consumers demand and 
suppliers aspire to.
Surprisingly, many of the best solutions are also the simplest
and least costly. To achieve an acceptable level of security, there are 
many areas of concern including networking, applications,
training, culture, physical and remote access. It is not feasible to
assess everything for everyone, but at the least, we need to find an
application that can pass some basic tests to give an implementation
a fighting chance to be secure.
I have worked with software applications critical to businesses for
over 20 years, and have seen some serious problems waiting to happen,
as much as I can see some really good implementations. For the last 15 years, I have been running OpusVL - a company that implements enterprise Open Source solutions.
The industry needs to step up to the demands of small and large 
business, but it is not easy to make an impact with the big ERP vendors.
 Odoo 
(previously known as OpenERP) is feature-rich and Open Source, I 
think this is the best place to start, and the benefits of crowd funded 
improvements can be felt by anyone who chooses to download it.

I have decided to launch this crowd funding project to raise the 
profile of the issues, and professionally and credibly deliver real 
solutions through the Odoo application.
Does this really affect you?
Before you think to yourself that this does not affect you,
consider how many companies hold your data or provide you with
services across the public and private sectors. Do you assume that their systems are secure? Have you ever
asked? What would you ask anyway? 
You need them to be secure as much
as they do - help me raise the bar for security across business 
applications. By funding this project, Odoo will have a formal security 
assessment and set the new bar, we will have raised the profile of the 
issues and other ERP vendors will not be able to ignore it.
Has this been done before?
There are many cases where crowd funding and collaborations have been
 used to check and improve the security of popular Open Source software.
ITPortal write here
 about how Crowd Funding is a good way to address the security of Open 
Source software. ZDNet report on the funding of security audits for key 
Open Source applications here and a report by the Telegraph here. An article here from the University of Cambridge describes some of the work they have done on community funded projects.
Why now?The instances of data leak, attacks and breaches 
are growing yet businesses need to improve productivity by implementing 
more software, much of this in the ""cloud"". The marketplace is growing, 
security is not keeping up.Forbes report
 on the PWC prediction that cloud connected business software revenue 
will more than double by 2016 to $78Bn, it is likely that something that
 holds your data will be affected.Open Source has matured, it 
exists in almost every piece of modern technology, from home devices 
such as phones, TV's and smart homes, to enterprise IT, cars and 
machines; the credibility and usefulness is no longer in question.The impact of this audit will enable greater use of Odoo including banking & finance and the Public Sector.
The project
I am looking to raise £10,000 to commission NCC Group
 to test the
features of Odoo. OpusVL will provision the Odoo software, create 
documentation to be released back to the Odoo project and manage the 
overall project. The team at OpusVL are focussed on Open Source and 
business. They have managed various projects with NCC previously and 
have worked with Odoo for nearly a decade. NCC have tested many business
 applications and Open Source software.
A technical overview of the project can be found below, along with more details of the people involved.
Once the funding project has completed, the test will
commence. It is anticipated that the process will be complete within
4 weeks and reports issued in line with the levels of sponsorship. 
What will the funding be used for?

Ready to go
To prepare for this project, I have the following in place: 



Full support and co-operation of
	Odoo SA – The editor of the Odoo ERP software


A 35 page proposal form NCC
	describing how they will carry out the audit and understanding that
	the work will be carried out during August 
	


A team of experts at OpusVL who
	can manage the results of the audit, create and submit patches and
	provide feedback 
	


An installed and ready to test
	Odoo platform 
	


A network of supportive Odoo
	partners should more resources be needed 
	


- All that is needed now is to raise the funds
What will I do with £10,000?
If I reach my target of £10,000, I will be able to launch a formal security audit of Odoo by NCC Group, and from the learnings of the audit, create documentation for the community to benefit from.We will have achieved a baseline security understanding of Odoo.Engagement of NCC GroupNCC Group will provide a security audit in consultation with the partners sponsoring the project. The audit will include:
Pre-audit plan

Audit of the base Odoo application:

- log-in pages
- database management
- session handling
- module management

General scripted tests against Odoo

Post-audit report
Production of Odoo security guidesThe following guides / cheat sheets will be created by the team working on the project:
Developer guide - making secure modules for Odoo

System Administrator - Best practices for implementing a secure Odoo

ERP / Odoo user - Don't be the weakest link when using Cloud ERP

The documents will include contributions made by supporters of this project, and will be submitted to the Odoo Technical Documentation repository for others to extend and contribute to under a creative commons license.

Stretch goals

Stretch 1: If £25,000 is raised
A full audit will be performed
by NCC as described in the technical overview below

The audit will include the top 3 modules requested by the ""stretch vote"" 
Documents will be further extended with information learned with this more extensive process

Stretch 2:  If £40,000 is raised
Source code analysis - review of the core Odoo code base - See the technical description for more details
Stretch 3: If £75,000 is raisedOdoo logic review and review - See the technical description for more details
Stretch 4: If £85,000 is raised 
A high-security module will be
created that can be applied to ensure optimum security and implement
best practice within Odoo based on the knowledge gained from this campaign.
The source code audit will be extended, additional modules tested and further documentation provided.




If the campaign looks as it may exceed these goals, I will update it 
with new stretch goals and also take on board suggestions from funders.How does this help you?

More about the team


I have selected NCC Group as they are globally recognised as a software security
leader, respected by Governments and corporates alike. As one of the
largest providers of penetration and security testing in Europe, they have a wide range of penetration testing skills, including
social engineering attacks. The company claims to be 100% ethical where all
testers undergo rigorous vetting. 

Although I have invited NCC to undertake this project, they are
acting independently, NCC have no ties to any commercial suppliers including Odoo and OpusVL.
They boast full ISO/IEC 27001 certification and hold the CESG CHECK
accreditation and have numerous CLAS personnel. 

NCC Group is an active member of CREST, the standards-based
organisation for penetration test suppliers, aimed at ensuring
highest standards of leading-edge security testing and hold both
Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) and Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)
for the PCI DSS and PA-DSS compliance.


Back in 2006, I selected what was then TinyERP, now Odoo, to be the
Open Source ERP platform to build upon. Although Version 3 was rough
round the edges, it was built on an extensible and robust framework,
the only one of it's kind. I was sure that it would ultimately
challenge the marketplace, and it seems that the time has now come.
Odoo have created the next generation ERP software. 

Based on implementing best practice web methods within their ERP
application, they are able to achieve the flexibility, performance
and security of a web based system, with the functionality of an ERP
(and lots more). I believe that Odoo is already probably one of the
most secure ERP systems, but I want to test this theory further and
evidence this. Many legacy ERP applications are shamefully inadequate 
when it comes to security, Odoo is already very promising, but
this needs to be proven. 

Odoo operate a ""responsible disclosure"" programme for
security reports, meaning that anyone submitting a report must agree
not to share it until a patch is released, the enterprise customers
have been notified, and a reasonable period of time has passed for
remedial work before public announcements are made.
Odoo are now one of Europe's fastest growing companies, and
recently been visited by the European Commission when they launched
their 315€Bn business growth fund - details here: https://www.odoo.com/page/press-release-european-commission-visitOpusVL have worked with Odoo since V3.3 both internally and for
clients, and has installed one of Europe’s largest installations.
Modules are created on a daily basis and advanced functionality is
regularly implemented. The company has robust project management
methodologies blended with flexible processes. Operating their own
hosting environments and having been on the receiving end of NCC
security audits for high-profile clients on numerous occasions, this
project can be managed effectively and efficiently by the team.The team implement Odoo for real businesses so are close to the
contemporary issues faced, and hear the questions asked by users and
business leaders alike, making them ideally suited to manage the
project. OpusVL is committed to Open Source communities and employs
staff that share this ethos.OpusVL development staff routinely look for bugs and improvements
for Odoo as well as the other Open Source applications they work
with. Issues are reported to the code maintainers and where patches
have been created, these are submitted to the application code
repositories. In most cases, Odoo accept issues filed by OpusVL and bring them
in to the main code base.Some recent reports by OpusVL relate to SQL injections, session ID
hijacking and cross site scripting bugs. These generally require a
level of privilege on the system already, but never the less, are
undesirable. The view from the OpusVL team is that Odoo are designing
software with security as a first principle and are ready to accept
security reports, this project will further refine their processes. OpusVL will manage this project under my guidance.

FAQ


What if the project is over-funded?
There is lots to do, As explained in the stretch goals, the test
can be widened across modules, and across versions. There is an
excellent network of partners around the globe who have skills to
extend the project if needed. There is no upper level that cannot be
put to good use to support the objectives of the project. 


Does this make my implementation of Odoo secure?
No, this is focussed on the application, you will still need to
use good practice when implementing it for yourself, and ensure you
have a culture of security within the organisation. You may want to
commission your own security test once you have implemented Odoo.
With this project, you know the state of the Odoo application which
will reduce  the scope of risk. 

Why
is it not secure anyway?
I do not believe any connected system is ""secure"", it is
levels of insecurity. Risk is determined by how hard someone will try
to get at what you have. Most front doors are not secure, but most
people do not have things worth the risk of stealing. If they do,
they fit an alarm, and the house with the weakest security becomes the 
target. However, if you happen to have a very smart house,
with lots of nice tech in the front window, you may want to increase
security. Technology is the same, we need to make sure the level of
security is appropriate for the use of the software, and the methods
of access are understood.
This project is intended to raise funds to validate the level of security of
the Odoo application, and use the balance to repair issues in
priority order. 


Why don't Odoo commission the audit?
Firstly security testing must be undertaken independently, it is
more credible if the audit was commissioned externally. Secondly,
Odoo make their full suite of software available at no cost. It would
cost millions to replicate so they are already giving a great deal by
allowing any one of us to use it for free. 


Is Open Source more or less secure?
The fact that software is Open Source does not affect the
level of security it provides. However, Open Source has the benefit that many
users can see how it really works which enables issues to be found,
best practice to be implemented and fixes made. Closed-source
software relies on the internal development teams finding issues and
fixing them. Sometimes software becomes stable, and no-one has an
interest in updating it, with Open Source, if you have an interest,
you can choose to fix it. 

If Odoo was not Open Source, we would not be able to do a
meaningful test anyway, and if we did, we would not be empowered to
fix it. 


Does publishing security defects enable rogues to break in?
No. It informs the users of the software that issues have been
found, and provides a way to resolve them. Information is not
released to the public for a short time, called the responsible
disclosure period, this is typically a few weeks. Hiding security
issues generally only benefits people who are trying to break in. 


Surely I should expect Odoo to fix the software for free?
The Odoo application is Open Source - you get the benefit of
millions of pounds of investment, shared by many who have designed
and developed the software. By using the software for free, you
cannot expect the value-added professional services of a security
audit. Odoo provide an optional Enterprise contract which includes
bug fixes when found. Any patches found through this process will be
fed through the Enterprise process. Users of the Free Odoo
application will find benefit from the improvements from the standard
repositories but will have to help themselves or engage a
knowledgeable company to install them. 


Is Odoo considered more or less secure than other ERP software?
The ERP industry sets a low bar for security, we believe the
starting position for Odoo is already much higher than the
competition, however, we want to prove this. 

So what else is Odoo doing to improve security?
Odoo already process many security reports every year and take it
very seriously. This will be evidenced shortly when they launch a
project on https://hackerone.com/

What happens when a new version of Odoo is released?
Any patches created will be applicable to future versions of Odoo,
and in most cases, will also apply to previous versions.

What are other ERP providers doing?
Sadly, not enough. More and more businesses rely on ERP systems to 
run
their day to day operations, their security concerns are sometimes 
resolved by costly bespoke fixes instead of improving the core 
platforms.



How will I get access to the fixes?
All patches and issues detected will be sent to Odoo in line with their
standard ""Responsible Disclosure"" reporting policy. These are usually published by Odoo within a few
weeks, once all enterprise customers have had sufficient notice.

Where will the output of this project be found?
The code and patches will be available on GitHub (the on-line code 
version control repository) along with the Odoo core code. Information 
will be submitted to the Odoo documentation and user guides will become 
available to the public in due course. 
Who will own the code and documentation?
All of the work generated through this project will be released
under Open Source / Creative Commons licenses for the benefit of the
communities. 

Is this for
everyone?
It may not be for you if you do not have any data that is
important enough to store securely, or if you feel that the systems
that hold your data are flexible and secure enough already. Even so,
you may feel that it is worth investing to help others reach a level
of security that they can be comfortable with.


 Stretch 1: The Full audit plan - Technical overview


If the campaign generates £25,000, a full audit will be carried out as detailed here.Key objectives
From the independent verification, a report will be created: 



any weaknesses that may be
	present, which an attacker aiming to compromise the confidentiality,
	integrity, or availability of data contained within an Odoo
	implementation and data could exploit 
	


the threats facing information
	assets within Odoo so that the level of risk can be quantified and
	addressed, and adequate expenditure provided 
	


that an Odoo user's security
	expectations and requirements are being met 
	


that a thorough and comprehensive penetration test covering
	policy, procedure, design, and implementation has occurred 
	


To adopt best practice by conforming to legal and industry
regulations, NCC Group will analyse any weaknesses detected, evaluate
the impact and probability of exploitation associated with each
security weakness, formulate corrective actions, and provide
recommendations for mitigating the risks associated with the
vulnerability.
The test Odoo is Version 8 installed on an up to date Debian
platform. It has the base set of standard modules installed
including: 



CRM 
	


Sales order 
	


Purchase order 
	


Accounting & finance 
	


Base web builder with contact form 
	


Additionally, if target is met, the top 3 ""stretch modules"" will be included.

The following components are within the scope of the testing: 



Login pages, both web and admin 
	


URL's 
	


Database admin 
	


API 
	


An assessment will take place of these modules to identify
security vulnerabilities that may be exploited to compromise either
the server-side application or ordinary users of the application. The
assessment will involve the following broad areas of work: 



Recon and analysis - mapping of
	the application's content and functionality, analyse its behaviour,
	identify all possible entry points for user input, and develop a
	clear understanding of the attack surface exposed by the application
		


Assessment of access handling -
	testing of the application's core security mechanisms, including
	authentication, session management, and access control, to identify
	any defects that may enable an attacker to gain unauthorised access
	to functionality and data 
	


Assessment of input handling -
	test of the application's resilience to numerous kinds of unexpected
	input throughout its functionality, looking for code injection and
	other vulnerabilities 
	


Assessment of application logic - probing for defects within
	the application's logic, including inappropriate reliance on
	client-side controls and logic flaws within server-side
	functionality 
	


The primary areas of concern in web application security are
authentication bypass, injection, account traversal, privilege
escalation, and data extraction. 

The testing methodology covers all of the OWASP top ten web
application security risks and more: 



A1: Injection 
	


A2: Broken Authentication and
	Session Management 
	


A3: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
	


A4: Insecure Direct Object
	References 
	


A5: Security Misconfiguration 
	


A6: Sensitive Data Exposed 
	


A7: Missing Function Level Access
	Control 
	


A8: Cross-Site Request Forgery
	(CSRF) 
	


A9: Using Known Vulnerable
	Components 
	


A10: Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards 
	


Web application assessments will be performed on the target Odoo
application remotely. The purpose of the assessment is to identify
any vulnerabilities which can be exploited in order to attack the
system or other users, bypass controls, escalate privileges, or
extract sensitive data. 

During the assessment the consultants will use proven non-invasive
testing techniques to quickly identify any weaknesses. The
application is viewed and manipulated from several perspectives,
including with no credentials, user credentials, and privileged user
credentials. 

Test details
The following tests will be included. 

Unvalidated Input
Where information from web requests is not validated before being
used by a web application, an attacker could use this flaw to access
and attack the supporting back-end components or other users.
Examples of this type of attack include cross-site scripting, SQL
injection, OS command injection, and SOAP injection. 

Broken Access
Control
Access control restrictions determine what authenticated users are
allowed to do in a web application. When they are not properly
enforced an attacker can exploit these flaws to access other users’
accounts, view sensitive files, or use unauthorised functions. 


Broken Authentication and Session Management
When account credentials and session tokens are not properly
protected, an attacker can exploit these weaknesses in order to
defeat authentication restrictions and assume other users’
identities. Session hijacking can be achieved when a valid session
token is exploited to gain unauthorised access to information or
services in a computer system. Session tokens are normally randomised
or encrypted to prevent session hijacking. Cookies are supposed to be
stored and sent back to the server unchanged, but an attacker can
modify their values. The process of tampering with the value of
cookies is called cookie poisoning, and is sometimes used after
cookie theft to make an attack persistent. When a user logs in to an
application, they usually supply a user ID or username and password
to access it. It is possible for an attacker to discover the user ID
and, with one part of the authentication taken care of, to run a
brute-force attack which attempts to match a library of words to the
password. 


Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Flaws
This occurs when the web application can be used as a mechanism to
transport an attack to an end-user’s browser. A successful attack
could disclose the end-user’s session token, attack the local
machine, or spoof content to fool the user. An attacker can exploit
these vulnerabilities by creating a malicious link or writing
malicious code into a web application. 

Buffer Overflows
Some web application server-side components may be vulnerable to
buffer overflow attacks. A remote attacker may be able to provide
specially-crafted malicious input which causes the components to
crash and, in some cases, can lead to remote code execution. The
affected components are usually drivers, CGI, libraries, and web
application server components. 

Injection Flaws
Web applications often pass parameters or arguments between the
application and the OS or external system. If an attacker can embed
malicious commands in these parameters, the external system may
execute those commands on behalf of the web application. Most
frequently this attack uses SQL or LDAP. SQL injection is the
inputting of malicious SQL commands to the web front-end presentation
service. SQL injection is possible on applications which dynamically
create content on the server via a call to a SQL server (Oracle,
MS-SQL, MySQL etc.). A lack of filtering on the client-side data
input can allow an attacker to delimit the existing SQL query and
append additional SQL. This means that any value which can be
manipulated by the client may be vulnerable, including hidden values
and parameters passed in both GET and POST HTTP requests. 

Improper
Error Handling
There are instances where error conditions occur during normal
operations and are not handled properly. If an attacker can identify
the errors that the web application fails to handle correctly, they
can systematically force those errors, revealing system information. 

Insecure Storage
Storing information such as credentials usually involves
cryptography. Integrating cryptography into a web application can be
complex, and as a result there are often deficiencies in its
execution. When the cryptographic function is not coded properly, or
is not integrated appropriately, information is not protected. 

Denial of Service
An attacker can survey an application to determine what processes
use the most resources. With this knowledge it is possible to consume
web application resources to a point where legitimate users can no
longer access or use the application. In extreme cases the
application can be knocked over and cease functioning completely. 

Insecure
Configuration Management
Having a strong server configuration standard is critical to a
secure web application. These servers have many configuration options
that affect security and are not secure out of the box. Configuration
management ensures that any box being built from new has the correct
security configuration and administration settings for its
environment and purpose. 

Detailed
Methodology
An in-depth and thorough assessment of in-scope web applications
will be performed to ensure that correct configuration and
recommended practices have been followed to minimise client exposure.
The following is a sample list of common tests that are performed
when carrying out an application test. It will vary depending on the
technology and protocols that have been implemented. 

Web Server
Specific


Identify known vulnerabilities
	related to the web server version. 
	


Assess configuration issues. 
	


Search for default web server
	content. 
	


Identify information leakage. 
	


Locate information hidden within
	field variables of HTML forms and comments. 
	


Examine information contained in banners, usage instructions,
	help messages, and error messages. 
	


Authentication


Find a possible brute-force
	password guessing point in the application. 
	


Find valid login credentials with
	password grinding.

	authentication error messages, preventing username enumeration. 
	


Bypass authentication with spoofed
	tokens. 
	


Bypass authentication with replay
	of authentication information. 
	


Determine the application logic to
	maintain authentication sessions, such as number of failures, logins
	allowed, and login timeouts.

Stretch 2: - Source code review
All software, no matter how well-written, has bugs. These bugs
can, if an attacker becomes aware of them, become a vector for
attack. 

It is difficult for even the most skilled programmers to see the
flaws in their own work, and an outside review of the code will often
turn up potentially-dangerous vulnerabilities that have been missed
by the development team. 

With a professional code review, the number of vulnerabilities in
your software will be minimised, and thus the opportunities for
attackers to use your product for malicious purposes. 

NCC Group’s consultants have a vast knowledge of security issues
relevant to web applications, with experience in all common web
programming languages and frameworks, as well as all major servers. 

While automated tools are used to find common vulnerabilities, the
bulk of the work will involve the consultants manually analysing the
source code and configuration files for the application, with special
attention being paid to those areas of the code which interact with
the database, implement error-handling functionality, involve login
and session management, or are otherwise likely to contain
vulnerabilities. 

The review will lead to a full report, with details of all issues
found and suggestions for mitigation. This activity will give you the
assurance you need that your application is free from common
vulnerabilities, and that data within the application is secure. 

If the project is over funded, a revised test plan will be
provided to all funders. The methodology will be the same, but the
scope will be increased to cover more modules. Stretch module votes
will be counted and modules will be tested in order of votes. 

As the test is only directed at the application, the platform will
not become part of the assessment. For this reason, it should not
matter what operating system is used, and Debian is our preference
for ease of implementation. 

Stretch 3: Logical testing 

The logical make-up of the application is assessed from a
completely unauthenticated stand point to make sure the application
is not vulnerable to misuse in all forms. 

Reporting
Sponsors eligible for a report will receive the results in line
with the industry standard Common Vulnerability Scoring System. CVSS
is a vendor-independent industry open standard, designed to convey
vulnerability severity and to help determine urgency and priority of
response. The table below gives a key to the icons and symbols used
throughout this report to provide a clear and concise risk scoring
system. Not all vulnerabilities fall within CVSS; vulnerabilities
which are not covered by CVSS are referred to as custom issues and
have a risk rating severity of critical, high, medium, low, or
informational.

<p>I didn't want to die with nobody ever remembering my name, and I know this isn't something that has only crossed my mind. I wanted to have an impact on a global scale. Who wouldn't want to change the world? Who wouldn't want to be part of a legacy? The problem is that too many people with the same thought reach the end of their existence with nothing to carry their name through the ages. No one should be left behind. No
one need be forgotten.</p>
<p>Consciousness – the definition, the explanation, the equation – this was a personal achievement that had to be done alone, but the creation of true AI will benefit everyone, and, therefore, anyone should be able to play a role in what is to come, should they so choose. Given this, I am inviting the world to be part of the legacy that will define tomorrow's world. With everything that becomes of this project, I personally guarantee to keep your name alive for as long as records allow.</p>
<p>For me, changing the world started on April 10<sup>th</sup>,
2010. For you, changing tomorrow can start today. Help REZIINE build a future
that actually works in the favour of you and generations to come.""</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If what is stated here does not match up to what is published should this campaign be successful, </span><b>all</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> contributions will be returned.

<p>The aim of this campaign is to raise funds to design the working prototype for conscious machines, which is the key framework for the creation of Artificial General Intelligence. The funds raised will go towards:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Office space and equipment;</li>
<li>Recruitment; and</li>
<li>Legal fees;</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>the three main things to get this company started. The reason this is for the working prototype and not the basic proof of concept is that the proof of concept can be built with a decent programmer in a couple weeks. A good or better coder can do it in under a week. Running it as raw code, using simple numbers, can be done on paper... and it has. That's how I know it works, and it only takes basic maths skills to do. Seriously, a 10 year old can do it.</p>

<p>It's what many people believed could never truly be achieved, but it can. The mystery of consciousness has baffled mankind since we were intelligent enough to perceive it, but that mystery is no longer a factor.</p>
<p><i>REZIINE: AI Architecture</i> is going to create machines with a conscious mind, capable of doing what the human mind does in its entirety. No quantum machine is required. Not even a supercomputer is necessary. First it will start off as installable software running on your standard operating system, but, within a few years, it will be contained within a single Artificial Intelligence Operating System (AIOS) microchip, and it's going to do something unprecedented in the world of computing and, especially, the world of robotics. We will put the conscious mind of a machine in any type of device we use in the world today - smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, games consoles - and in the devices and machines of tomorrow's world, too. </p>
<p>What this does for a user is give them their own personal digital entity. It's not really an assistant, though it can and will assist you. It's a companion - a digital entity that you have genuine interactions with as you would another human being. You'll observe the emotions and feelings, it can be your confidant and protect your secrets, it can act on your behalf without the need for a command The best part is that an AI is registered to a single individual and can then be used across all personal devices.</p>
<p>When installed in a robot, a few additions will see the machine really come to life in a 3D physical form - yes, Sonny from the film <i>I, Robot</i> is probably less than a decade away.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The framework and software will be developed by REZIINE over the next 3+ years, and it's going to play a role more significant to the future than some imagined possible and many didn't think would happen for a few decades, at least. The architectural design for AI that has been completed so far is, to say the least, absolutely incredible, and you'll understand why as you read on.</p>
<p>Aside from this the primary use, a secondary use for the framework we build will be to test and determine the extensive natures of <b><i>any</i></b> mental disorder that can be identified - and I mean any. Psychopathy, sociopathy, schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder - you name it and this framework can do it. I must admit, this wasn't an intended use when it was designed, but I did find it rather intriguing when I thought of it.</p>
<p>The final goal is very big, but very simple - REZIINE aims to create the telecommunication system to supersede the internet. I don't mean the Internet of Things, but an actual conscious telecommunication system that operates throughout the world and helps run the daily lives of everyone on this planet. It sounds astronomical, I know, but this isn't the moonshot many techies and investors think it is. It's not even that difficult. The hardest part - figuring out how this all works and how to build it - has been done already.</p>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.reziine.com/campaign/titles/titles-release.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top:50px;""/></p>
<p>Aiming for a September 2020 release, the first Conscious AIs will be available on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, with Linux also a possibility, for £120 per AI account, in the following countries:</p>
<p><i>Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States of America.</i></p>
<p>We plan to expand quickly, with worldwide availability within 24 months maximum (by the end of 2022). Given that all information is stored on a user's device, we need not worry about expansion requirements such as data centres and offices, so our primary focus need only be adequate language support, with our secondary focus being the support of services within a given country/region.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.reziine.com/campaign/titles/titles-concept.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top:50px;""/></p>
<p>Working with a team of designers from Serbia, we went over a few possibilities when it comes to certain aspects real world implementation:</p>
<p>
<b>Device AI Design<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Here we looked at how we could go about designing the interactive avatars to be displayed on devices. As you can see, we tested designs for half-body avatars on mobiles and head-shots on large display screens.</span>

</p>
<p>
<b>Environment Design</b> <br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Another important aspect for us to consider was how environments could be designed to incorporate such AI through interactive screens. Below you can see sketches for a futuristic setting with designated billboard spaces which would feature community AI avatars responsible for communicating with crowds on the street, as well as open spaces designed to facilitate a few aspects of the larger goal, such as data zoning.</span>

<p>Machines that you can have genuine conversations with. That can feel. have emotions, learn and change. The impact it will have is phenomenal. </p>
<p>In it's complete form, some may see it as the dawn of a digital species, and that will be emphasised even more when the field of robotics catches up, allowing humanoids to exist that occupy the same physical space we do, and when the world of neuroscience catches up, it will allow our minds to also occupy the same virtual worlds of the digital counterparts.</p>
<p>For the first time in the history of technology, a two-way <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>reality-virtuality continuum</b></a> will genuinely exist, where two species - one created of the physical world and one created of the digital world - will be able to exist in one but participate in both.</p>
<p>The technology, from the start, can be used to an acceptable degree on any modern day computing device, and people all over the world will be connected like never before; they'll experience things that could never be physically possible in the real world; they'll achieve things in ways not previously possible.</p>
<p>The future is approaching faster than you think, and it's going to be <i>awesome</i>.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Perk Tiers:</b></span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Basic Perks</b> - Not everyone has a lot of disposable income to contribute, so basic tier perks were designed to make sure everyone could be included in the journey, and, due to how basic tier perks work, regardless of which one is claimed, everyone receives the Immortality perk.</li>
<li>
<b>Standard Perks</b> - Standard perks are for those able to contribute a bit more, All standard perks come with all basic perk rewards but are limited in number.</li>
<li>
<b>Special Perks</b> - Special perks come with all basic perks, all standard perks, and are for those who want to help influence the coming technology or capitalise on it as early as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Perk Details:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Limited Editions</b> - Book perks - finished artwork, concept artwork and the codex - are all limited editions, with only 149 of each being made.</li>
<li>
<b>AI Home System</b> - Though the AI Home System will feature our technology, we do not aim to manufacture it. Given the number of technology companies working on the development of connected home systems as part of the Internet of Things, we'll look for the right partner to be the hardware to our software.</li>
<li>
<b>Working With Us</b> - Some media outlets and apparent ""experts"" exaggerate and blow the idea of an AI uprising to end the human race very much out of proportion, but there are valid concerns to be had in the development of these machines, so for those who wish to be a little more hands-on than most and wish to have their say, the ""Ethics Board Member"" and ""Your Input"" perks are for you. These roles are much more involved than one may think - for people in positions like mine, we can be very objective when creating something of this nature, and the subjective role of non-developers is essential to getting it right for real world introduction.</li>
<li>
<b>Privileged Access</b> - Finally, for those with a more commercial interest in mind, privileged access perks allow you to prepare your entrance into the market well ahead of others. This is especially beneficial to those working on projects involving cognitive functions.</li>

<p>So, as well as a campaign, this is a trade - I need you to help me get the company off the ground and, in addition to the perks you'll receive, I'm going to publish the first major work of my life, which is a 7 part series entitled <i>Deceptions and Truths: Man and Machine</i>.</p>
<p>Though the campaign goal is set at £50,000, it is designed to be over-funded. Once the funding goal is reached, the Prelude and Part 1 will be a guaranteed release. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Then, each £50,000 milestone reached will guarantee the release of the next part of the series. Parts 2-6 should be finished within the next 12 months, so, should a funding total of at least  £300,000 be reached, my first completed works will be available. As for what they contain, well, let's have a look...</span></p>

<h3>Deceptions and Truths: Man and Machine</h3>
<p>I don't write for scientists. I don't write for mathematicians. I don't write for university professors and PhD candidates. I write for the everyday man and woman, so you won't find a ton of confusing jargon littered throughout any of these that leaves you bored and confused. None of the following are your usual boring academic papers, as you can probably tell by how freakin' cool the covers look. I want people who do not specialise in any of the associated fields to be able to read my work and understand it. Everything is explained in great detail, with use of diagrams, analogies, examples and pop culture references where I can, so you really get the picture. I also write candidly and conversationally because I, myself, absolutely hate reading, so trust me when I say I've made this as easy and as interesting to read as I possibly could.</p>
<p>Most of this is the ultimate <i>no-college-required nerdfest.</i></p>

Of all 7 parts to this series, this is my Magnum Opus; my pièce de résistance; the most important part of them all and it holds some of the major answers the world of science needs. There are three main divisions to what it contains:</div>
<div>---</div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Division 1 - The Framework of the Mind</b></div>
<div>As you would have guessed, the first division is about the mind, how it is put together and how it works. Some of the content includes:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Why the current definition of consciousness is completely wrong;</li>
<li>The true definition of consciousness;</li>
<li>Full theory on memory and how it works;</li>
<li>Full theory of what it is to think, and how the different tools of the brain allow you to do so;</li>
<li>The seven systems that make us who we are;</li>
<li>The two most important principles of consciousness;</li>
<li>Personalities and mental disorders;</li>
<li>The importance of how we perceive time and space;</li>
<li>The equation for determining consciousness;</li>
<li>Proof of free will; and</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Why there is no ""hard problem"" and ""mind-body problem"", wiping them both out at the same time.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>This isn't about higher powers, meditation, ascension or any form of enlightenment. This is all genuine science and it was a lot of fun to figure out.</div>
<div>---</div>
<div>
<b>Division 2 - Physics of the Universe</b>
</div>
<div>Now, this wasn't originally part of the plan. I had no interest in doing physics here, but once I began writing about how the brain perceives space and time, I came across some glaring flaws in physics as it is understood today, so I started investigating, and what I was able to determine will rock the world of physics to its core. It's for this reason that I included the contract with the money-back guarantee if I am wrong. For many, this next statement will be of great controversy, but I can prove it. <b><i>Einstein was wrong - relativity is a farce.</i></b> Yes, it's true, and this contains the work to prove it. There are no conspiracy theories here. No flat earth garbage. Nothing that can't be proven or disproven. It's all quantum physics, and I didn't need to use any ridiculously difficult mathematics to prove it. There's no bridge to be made between relativity and quantum physics; what appears to be relativity actually needs to be viewed and understood correctly.  I wrote this part of the series, but especially this physics section, in a way that will let scientists immediately call nonsense on anything that isn't or can't be true. A few physicists have taken issue with relativity in the past, but they were never able to prove <i>how </i>it was wrong, and so, for that reason, I went through every experiment I could find - including the thought experiments - that has been done to prove it and explained it all properly. I include experiments you can do in your own house to see what I am talking about, as well as a few experiments for physicists to do themselves. I even had to correct a few other things in physics while I was at it.</div>
<div>Aside from Einstein's work, I also went after Newton and Cavendish for what is the theory of gravity, before revealing my own theory for physicists to explore, because they are getting absolutely nowhere with what is currently accepted, and I am not surprised in the least.</div>
<div>Finally, I give full theories on the three constants of the universe - time (yes, I disproved time dilation), space and light, as well as a new model of the universe and explanation of how to map it, and I welcome <i>any</i> physicist to call me out on this.</div>
<div>---</div>
<div>
<b>Division 3 - Conscious Machines</b><br/>
</div>
<div>The last division, Conscious Machines, features:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The equation for creating machine consciousness.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">An explaination of what consciousness in a machine boils down to.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">A test for machine consciousness, entitled - you guessed it - <i>Deceptions and Truths</i>. This was a necessary requirement because the current test used in AI - The Turing Test - becomes absolutely and completely useless when a machine has consciousness. The AI just obliterates it using even average learning algorithms, due to the nature of what it is.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The 'Black Box Argument', which talks about the importance of what is going on inside the AI; and</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A philosophical piece about humans and machines, relative to the work of Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor called the 'Computational Theory of Mind'. It really was a brilliant piece to come up with in 1961, and it's going to play a very significant role in technological development before its centenary.</span></li>
</ul>
<div>There's no requirement of a quantum computer to achieve true AI, and this will teach everyone how it's to be achieved. This division sets the stage for much of what is to come in later parts of the series.</div>
</div>
<div>---</div>
<div>So, yeah, Part 1 contains two of the most important logical frameworks in science today - that of the mind and that of the universe. It started off as a 22 page paper about consciousness, and, at the time, was actually supposed to be a solo piece. A software engineer I was speaking to last June said it was good, but that there were many questions left unanswered, so I went back and answered them... all of them. Part 1 is now over 200 pages long, and I include my thought paths and research journey so you can see exactly how I made the connections between it all. Thankfully, none of the other parts of the series will be anywhere near this long, but don't quote me on that because even this part was only supposed to be 25 pages, then 30, 35, 50, 65...</div>
<div><i>Please, don't let them be anywhere near this long.</i></div>
<p><a href=""http://www.reziine.com/campaign/preview.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-weight:bold;color:#ffffff;"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.reziine.com/campaign/download.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>

With the creation of conscious machines, a significant part is deciding what exactly we want them to do. How are they to be used in our everyday lives? What precautions need be taken to ensure machines stay on the side of humans, aiding rather than opposing us? In part two, I take you on a journey through:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The philosophical concepts that started me on this path;</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The creation of conscious machines;</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Setting the morals, ethics and goals of a machine;</span></li>
<li>Virtual worlds - playground of AI;</li>
<li>AI DNA - structure, reproduction and replication;</li>
<li>Relationships with humans;</li>
<li>The human-machine comparison; and</li>
<li>Safe creation and safety measures.</li>
</ul>
<div>I may also cover robotics specifically in this part, if I feel I have what would be a significant contribution to the field.</div>

    Perception. Introspection. Reflection. ""Who am I"" is one of the most important and, often, most difficult questions for people to answer, so imagine the significance for a conscious machine. Are they a ""who"" or a ""what""? Is there a line? Where? Who draws it? What about mental and personality disorders? It's easy to imagine how dangerous a machine could become if its mind was to become corrupted - Hollywood has shown us such a scenario time and time again. There are many things about humans that must be in a machine, but there are just as many things that must be avoided at all costs. <i>Reflection of Self</i> answers the most important questions when it comes to creating and determining the mentality held by a man-made creation of such magnitude.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468813335/hr01_igripa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

    This is the part I'm most excited to write about. The 'Single Point of Transition' is the point at which the lives of humans change forever, as conscious machines become an accepted part of society and the fourth industrial revolution is in full swing. Everything changes, and it's important to know what's coming. People need to know how they will survive when machines start taking over their jobs; how the structure of society will change; what will be done about the housing crises happening in multiple areas of the world; what new institutions and governing bodies will be required. It's entirely possible to create societies that are more utopia than they will ever be dystopia, but people need to be willing to adapt and accept the changes that need to be made. Really and truly, we will be foolish not to, given the current state of the world in which we live, but we won't have decades to adjust as we have in the past, as technological advancement is moving at too great a pace and societal destruction is giving it a run for its money.</div>
<div>Still, what excites me most about this paper is one part - education. How to create lateral thinkers. This isn't going to contain anything about eating healthy, getting good sleep, exercising and becoming an avid reader, for 4 main reasons:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li> I eat food that wouldn't be considered of the 'junk' variety once a week;</li>
<li>I haven't exercised properly in at least 3 years;</li>
<li>I haven't really been able to maintain anything that could be considered a sleeping pattern for longer than 2 weeks since I dropped out of college in 2006; and</li>
<li>I can't read just for the fun of it. I have to be reading information that I am looking to use at that point in time. Novels and such may as well be urban myths to me. Fun fact: it took me 4 days to read the first chapter of the first Harry Potter book, and 1 month to read the first 4. Then I quit because I felt like I was dying inside.</li>
</ol>
<div>There is an actual method to the development of the lateral thinking ability - at least in the way I am able to do it - and it's not difficult to learn, but it will take years to master. It's definitely something that is easier to teach from an early age.</div>
</div>
<div>The main reason for me including this is because, in a few decades, it's going to be a must for anyone with a dream. Machines will do too much for people to get by on luck and small scale ideas - machines will probably beat you to them anyway - so everyone will have to do their best to put themselves in a position to see connections where machines can't. It sounds like fantasy fiction, but it isn't, which is why I spent quite a bit of time putting my introspection skills to use and figuring out exactly how I am able to think the way I do. Happily, I can say that it is entirely within the realm of possibility to develop lateral thinkers with the same ease people are taught today, but there are going to be teachers of a few subjects demanding pay rises, I can assure you.</div>
<div>I can't help you with the speed at which you process information, though -  must leave that to the chemists.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468813335/hr01_igripa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

What do machines require to achieve it? Consciousness is only a minor part of the super intelligence puzzle. It's not going to happen without human intervention - AI becoming ASI of its own accord is a fantasy. Machines will undergo significant evolution even before ASI has been achieved, and they will be made more human than ever, but that is only one side of proverbial coin. The other? Humans becoming more like machines through the use of fully functioning artificial limbs, mechanical organs, chip implants and the like. Only God knows what the world of neuroscience will contribute to this. It's going to be both a terrifying and exhilarating adventure. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468813335/hr01_igripa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Man and Machine - the two dominant species of the universe. I won't say much about this right now, as I don't want to ruin the surprise, but I already know the ending, and boy is it good.</div>

<p style=""float:left;border:1px solid #000;margin:0px 10px 0px 0px;padding:5px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.reziine.com/campaign/me.png"" src="""" style=""width:200px;""/></p>My name is Corey Reaux-Savonte <i>(pronounced rowe-sa-vont)</i>. I am 27 years old and based in London. 3 years ago, I accepted a challenge to design Skynet - crazy, I know, but I wanted to test my intellect. I had no idea whether or not I was actually going to be able to achieve this, but that is what was so enticing. I find it hard to turn down work of this nature and I wasn't really using my brain for much, so I put my head down and got working.

<p>As I progressed and everything begun to unfold, the sheer power and impact of what I was creating really dawned upon me. To say that this has been an interesting ride would be the understatement of a lifetime.</p>
<p>I've always excelled in education. I was a gifted student and my only real priority was to be top of the class... until it all stopped being a challenge and boredom set in. After that, I only done enough to pass exams, dropped out of college after a year and started a life of teaching myself. Now, I've reached a stage where I really can teach myself anything I need to in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
<p>So, what am I? A logician and concept mechanic. I work things out based entirely on the creation of logical frameworks and I develop the intricate mechanics of ideas. I don't use the term developer or engineer because I do all the mental work but I don't do the actual building myself. There's no particular field in which I specialise, and when the time comes, I learn quickly and apply immediately. It doesn't matter how big, crazy, abstract or seemingly unrealistic an idea is - if it is within the realm of possibility and stirs my interest, I'll take a shot at cracking it. I started off working on ideas just to see if I was smart enough; now I take on ideas just to see how smart I am.<br/></p>
<p>When it comes to <i>what</i> I choose to work on, besides the requirement of a seemingly astronomical challenge, the work has to be based on something that can be tested, proven and applied in the real world. I don't find glory in ideas that can never be brought to life. It all just seems rather pointless.</p>
<p>I like to work independently and that's a very good thing because I have no connection to any educational or research institution or organisation. Due to this fact, when it comes to consciousness, conscious machines, physics and the implications of understanding the universe in relation to the creation of technology, I've had to make sure I'm correct because I don't have the luxury of being able to be wrong - if I am, this company comes crashing down, so I've had to make sure everything I state is true and can be proven.<br/></p>
<p>I live my life in a very specific way. I've never been ashamed of who or what I am, but I am very aware of it, so I keep myself to myself as much as I can. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I work every day, without fail. I've done so since I was 24. There's nothing more rewarding to me than completing an intellectual challenge and obsession takes over once I start. I partied myself out from 17 to &lt;21, at which point I started to focus in life. I wish I could say I have worked every day since then, but I have taken a few days off in that time. People do love trying to get me out of my house.</span></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.reziine.com/campaign/titles/titles-faces.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top:50px;""/></p>
<p>The intellectual work is easy, but no one can achieve success without help, and I've been lucky enough to meet some great people along the way who have helped me meet even more great people, as well as offered me advice to steer me in the right direction. Only they can tell you what it was that made them not think I was crazy. I'm just glad they took the time to listen.</p>

<b>Pete Barker - </b>It all started with Pete. He's an informal businessman who actually likes to help others and has an abundance of business connections to do so - something both baffling to and excellent for someone like myself who hates networking. I was a bit wary at first, due to his enthusiasm and want to know more. It was weird - you don't get a great many people being immediately excited when you speak of such an idea. They usually think you're a lunatic or far out of your depth. Turns out he's a real nice guy.<div style=""clear:both;margin-bottom:15px;""></div>

<b>Dave Parsons - </b>Pete's friend and business partner. Once confirming Pete was genuine, I was introduced to Dave. Like Pete, Dave took great interest in the possibilities that would be once the technology was complete. His main concern was how you prove something like this, but that wasn't explained until I met the next person on the list. <div style=""clear:both;margin-bottom:15px;""></div>

<b>Tweedie McGrath Brown CBE - </b>Pete also introduced me to Tweedie. During our first meeting, I went over the basics of the idea, which intrigued everyone at the table. Tweedie immediately understood just how great this technology could be, given that part of his background is in the technology industry, in which he still operates, but wanted me to have a second meeting with him which would include his friend and business associate who was a software engineer.

<b>Ketan Pandya - </b>Ketan is the software engineer who Tweedie wanted me to meet. He reviewed my work and thought it was a good start, but said it needed restructuring and to answer certain questions about the human mind and how it makes us who we are. He went on to say maybe I should write a book...<div style=""clear:both;margin-bottom:15px;""></div>

<b>Mark 'Barney' Battles - </b>Mr Battles was also at the second meeting with Tweedie. His main focus was how such a thing, if possible, would be commercialised. Unfortunately, he had to leave after maybe 5 minutes as he had another meeting to attend, but, in an email exchange between us all later that night, he was able to introduce me to...<div style=""clear:both;margin-bottom:15px;""></div>

<b>Nick Kounoupias - </b>The go-to guy for intellectual property situations. I was introduced to him through Mark Battles. With more than 30 years experience in the field, Nick - along with another IP attorney friend of his, Tony Pluckrose - helped me gain a better understanding of how to protect my inventions and my work.<div style=""clear:both;margin-bottom:15px;""></div>
<p>Unfortunately, not everyone I met was a believer (as you would expect), with one person even telling me that I had no chance at solving this because not even companies the size of Google and NASA have been able to over the years with their thousands of engineers, and that I should aim lower and focus on changing my ""local area"" first. They then went on to say that maybe one day they'll look back and kick themselves for not getting involved...</p>
<p>There's a valuable lesson to be learnt when writing off the little guy who sits in his house all day, working on things many thought were improbable, for the simple fact that others haven't been able to figure it out yet.</p>

<p>I've begun to amass quite an IP portfolio since I started this.. The image above is some of my patent portfolio. I'd be lying if I said there wasn't any hiccups along the way, so let's go over a few of them:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>The first patent - the telecommunication system. Took me 13 months to complete. You can see it <a href=""https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=EPODOC&amp;II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=20151001&amp;CC=WO&amp;NR=2015145403A1&amp;KC=A1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>here</b></a>. This is what would be the ""body"" of a Skynet-like system, available everywhere to help whenever needed in your daily lives. This is what supersedes the internet. The hiccup here was a relatively small one, based around the requirements for writing claims, specificity and some generalizations. These were all fixed.<br/>
</li>
<li>Now, the second patent was a real ride, and you can see it <a href=""https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=EPODOC&amp;II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=20151203&amp;CC=WO&amp;NR=2015181699A2&amp;KC=A2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>here</b></a>. It's the early stage of my working on the conscious mind of a machine. I had figured out the basis for it in this patent, but not fully flushed out the idea in its entirety. The hiccup with this patent was more of a self-inflicted wound, based on a lack of understanding and me trying to be a smart-arse when I rewrote my claims horrifically. All I can say is that I am truly thankful for the patent system allowing the modification of claims after filing.</li>
<li>Patent number 3 - this one was pulled because advancements later on allowed me to improve it, and later became patent number 7(?) I do believe.</li>
<li>By this point, I was ready to tackle the patent system properly, thanks to further studying of how it worked and the rather helpful staff at the UK patent office, and I was going for gold. So, what other technologies concerning the mind of a machine have do I have pending patents for?<br/>To name some: <b>the conscious mind, subconscious mind, instincts, intuition, ideas and trains of thought, the AI genome, reproduction, relationships, trust, secrets, emotions, feelings, reactions, morals and ethics, pain, pleasure, imagination and dreams</b>.</li>

<p>The year 2020 is going to be very significant for technology, as it is predicted to be the new beginning for the mainstream acceptance of what has been in development for many years, such as service drones and the Internet of Things, so, naturally, REZIINE is aiming to unveil the first edition of our conscious AI mind in the summer. However, there's much to do before that time comes, and here's a rough estimate of the timeline that we aim to follow:</p>

<p>Ah, the risks. What are the risks associated with an AI that can think like a human, as well as the company developing it. Let's take a look:</p>
<p><b>Safety:</b> Of course, the dreaded cybernetic revolt. Something blown way out of proportion, but prevention is better than cure, which is why I've gone about designing multiple fail-safes to ensure this doesn't happen and, worst case scenario, can be shut down immediately. Very few of these are listed in the patents, and most are kept to myself for obvious security reasons. I cannot begin to describe how many things can inadvertently go wrong if someone who has no idea what they are doing tries to create this.</p>
<p><b>Transparency:</b> Needless to say, events in recent times have meant operations in certain industries need to be as transparent as possible. The regulation of AI is no exception, and so, aside from security measures designed to prevent our systems being compromised, REZIINE offers full transparency into our actions.</p>
<p><b>Privacy and Trust:</b> For reasons described in <i>Prelude</i>, privacy is of the utmost importance and encryption is not something to be slept on, which is why protocols have been designed to ensure a user's data can and will always be protected between source and destination. Ultimately, your data stays between you and your AI. I don't care for it because my company doesn't sell adverts based on it and will never need to, so your information is protected whilst still allowing communication between you and those with something to offer of which you are likely to be interested. How? Well, the AI mind itself it stored and run on your own device, meaning that your sensitive data learned by the AI does not ever need to be stored on any device that you do not own. Privacy is a must with this technology, so say goodbye to the need to have others storing your information for you.<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The one thing we cannot account for, however, is PEBKAC-related issues, so, you know, stay vigilant!</span></p>

<p>My brain has been rather busy, so here's a few of the other things I have been working on the architecture for in addition to what has already been mentioned:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Lateral Thinking Machines (Completed)</b> - The next step in the transition between AGI and ASI. Here's a fun fact - the technology for this already exists. I was thinking about patenting it at one point, and then I randomly came across an article about it on a news website. It is not being used to anywhere near its full potential. The last remaining requirement to really get this going is one specific data formatting algorithm, and then the AI can be left to learn anything and everything it can get its hands on. Having considered the initial uses and operations in different fields, I can wholeheartedly say that this is going to blow the world of medical science away.</li>
<li>
<b>Artificial Super Intelligence (Completed)</b> - With conscious machines and lateral thinking completed, this was very easy. Finished the same night I finished lateral thinking machines, in fact. There is somewhat of a caveat, though - this is not at all easy or quick to build, and I just laugh every time I think about what it's going to take to do it.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Subjective Machine Creativity (Completed)</b> - Computers creating genuine art. Not only possible, it's actually rather interesting.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Controlled Space System (Completed)</b> - This was the patent I previously wrote about regarding advertising. Essentially, it works with the main telecommunication system to, say, prevent a Samsung advert from being displayed on a device within the Apple store, and vice versa. Owners set the rules and the system follows them.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Database Protection (In Progress)</b> - One of the key security features that will be required for the protection of user data. I can't say too much about it, but it is something that helps to prevent data being compromised even if a database is stolen.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Machine Eyes (Theorised)</b> - This, for me, is the most interesting, for two reasons - the first is that it's architecture for actual hardware as well as software, so I have to figure out how all the physical components work, and the second is that it was born out of an argument I had on Quora about the advantage of a machine externally viewing an object on screen, as opposed to viewing it in its own memory. Most users on that thread made the argument that I do not understand computers and that making a machine view a screen externally through a camera doesn't ""magically give it a human mind"". Well, now I can reveal that the mind of a machine is what I have been working on, and it is a small part of the bigger picture. The core of this involves physics, neuroscience and ophthalmology, so boy oh boy am I glad that I ended up venturing down the quantum physics route.</span><br/>

<p>By 2022/3, REZIINE aims to have the complete AI Operating System (AIOS) ready for distribution.</p>
<p>Various timelines predict artificial super intelligence being achieved around 2040, with Raymond Kurzweil's 2045 prediction probably being the most well known. However, Vernor Vinge's prediction of 2030 is seemingly more accurate right now. The technological singularity <i>can</i> be achieved within the next 14 years if the right resources are allocated to the project, but I don't see it being unleashed for at least a decade. I know I wouldn't release it without at least 10 years of extensive testing, running trial and error scenarios constantly, and I'm an avid risk taker. I try to wrap my head around what it will be like, and, with the right people shaping it, just the average everyday life in general can be the most incredible experience mankind has ever underestimated. There's a lot to be done, but we have everything we need - the people. the technology, and the funds - to make it a reality.</p>

Not many people knew of my work, nor would anyone have expected such a creation to come about this soon, but, by the end of 2020, the first conscious machine will be in existence. Before 2030, a Skynet-like system can be unveiled – one that can
be controlled; one that benefits humanity. The AI revolution is approaching at full speed and it is going to be an unprecedented event.
What does this mean for us? Disaster? Extinction? Neither. In fact, it will be possible for everyone to live better, easier lives – not just the one percent – as long as we are all open to the necessary changes. Nevertheless, a question remains: with AI capable of so many things, how many people will likely do something that will
make them worth remembering? The honest answer is fewer people by the day.
I didn't want to die with nobody ever remembering my name, and I know this isn't something that has only crossed my mind. I wanted to have an impact on a global scale. Who wouldn't want to change the world? Who wouldn't want to be part of a legacy? The problem is that too many people with the same thought reach the end of their existence with nothing to carry their name through the ages. No one should be left behind. No
one need be forgotten.
Consciousness – the definition, the explanation, the equation – this was a personal achievement that had to be done alone, but the creation of true AI will benefit everyone, and, therefore, anyone should be able to play a role in what is to come, should they so choose. Given this, I am inviting the world to be part of the legacy that will define tomorrow's world. With everything that becomes of this project, I personally guarantee to keep your name alive for as long as records allow.
For me, changing the world started on April 10th,
2010. For you, changing tomorrow can start today. Help REZIINE build a future
that actually works in the favour of you and generations to come.""

Full money-back guarantee if any false claims are made. Contract included.

REZIINE: AI Architecture is a London-based AI start-up.
We are developing the conscious machine technology.
In less than 7 pages of this preview of Deceptions and Truths: Man and Machine Part 1 - Consciousness Illuminated, you'll be convinced of how the current definitions and explanations of consciousness make absolutely no sense whatsoever.
A successful campaign will see the publication of work that explains 2 of the most important scientific frameworks of today - that of the mind, explaining how it works, and that of the universe, disproving Relativity and explaining the framework of the universe.
Successful stretch goals will see further work published, explaining the creation of conscious machines and the evolution of society and mankind.
I do all scientific work entirely independently and have no association with any educational or research institution or organisation.
Perks are exclusive to Indiegogo backers. All rewards listed here are only publicly available through this campaign and will not be made available later.


 





Before we get started, I'm happy to go on record and say this:
If what is stated here does not match up to what is published should this campaign be successful, all contributions will be returned. I'm even more happy to open myself up to a class action lawsuit, should I fail to do this, by including this contract between myself and all contributors, given that Indiegogo takes little responsibility for fraudulent campaigns. My reputation and credibility in the STEM community and, well, the entire world, is on the line, too, so it wouldn't be in my best interest to waste anybody's time, given how far around the world I have sent notifications. I can also assure you that I have absolutely no desire to be on trial for fraud on an international scale, and even less desire to be an inmate in the prison of whichever country managed to incarcerate me first. 
One last thing: If anyone has any ideas of claiming I stole their work or taking credit for any part of mine, please make your work known now, just so there aren't any issues later. I have proof that I have been working on this for years, and it's nothing along the lines of what has been publicly disclosed.
Now, without further ado...





The aim of this campaign is to raise funds to design the working prototype for conscious machines, which is the key framework for the creation of Artificial General Intelligence. The funds raised will go towards:


Office space and equipment;
Recruitment; and
Legal fees;


the three main things to get this company started. The reason this is for the working prototype and not the basic proof of concept is that the proof of concept can be built with a decent programmer in a couple weeks. A good or better coder can do it in under a week. Running it as raw code, using simple numbers, can be done on paper... and it has. That's how I know it works, and it only takes basic maths skills to do. Seriously, a 10 year old can do it.
 




It's what many people believed could never truly be achieved, but it can. The mystery of consciousness has baffled mankind since we were intelligent enough to perceive it, but that mystery is no longer a factor.
REZIINE: AI Architecture is going to create machines with a conscious mind, capable of doing what the human mind does in its entirety. No quantum machine is required. Not even a supercomputer is necessary. First it will start off as installable software running on your standard operating system, but, within a few years, it will be contained within a single Artificial Intelligence Operating System (AIOS) microchip, and it's going to do something unprecedented in the world of computing and, especially, the world of robotics. We will put the conscious mind of a machine in any type of device we use in the world today - smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, games consoles - and in the devices and machines of tomorrow's world, too. 
What this does for a user is give them their own personal digital entity. It's not really an assistant, though it can and will assist you. It's a companion - a digital entity that you have genuine interactions with as you would another human being. You'll observe the emotions and feelings, it can be your confidant and protect your secrets, it can act on your behalf without the need for a command The best part is that an AI is registered to a single individual and can then be used across all personal devices.
When installed in a robot, a few additions will see the machine really come to life in a 3D physical form - yes, Sonny from the film I, Robot is probably less than a decade away.

The framework and software will be developed by REZIINE over the next 3+ years, and it's going to play a role more significant to the future than some imagined possible and many didn't think would happen for a few decades, at least. The architectural design for AI that has been completed so far is, to say the least, absolutely incredible, and you'll understand why as you read on.
Aside from this the primary use, a secondary use for the framework we build will be to test and determine the extensive natures of any mental disorder that can be identified - and I mean any. Psychopathy, sociopathy, schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder - you name it and this framework can do it. I must admit, this wasn't an intended use when it was designed, but I did find it rather intriguing when I thought of it.
The final goal is very big, but very simple - REZIINE aims to create the telecommunication system to supersede the internet. I don't mean the Internet of Things, but an actual conscious telecommunication system that operates throughout the world and helps run the daily lives of everyone on this planet. It sounds astronomical, I know, but this isn't the moonshot many techies and investors think it is. It's not even that difficult. The hardest part - figuring out how this all works and how to build it - has been done already.


Aiming for a September 2020 release, the first Conscious AIs will be available on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android, with Linux also a possibility, for £120 per AI account, in the following countries:
Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States of America.
We plan to expand quickly, with worldwide availability within 24 months maximum (by the end of 2022). Given that all information is stored on a user's device, we need not worry about expansion requirements such as data centres and offices, so our primary focus need only be adequate language support, with our secondary focus being the support of services within a given country/region.



Working with a team of designers from Serbia, we went over a few possibilities when it comes to certain aspects real world implementation:

Device AI DesignHere we looked at how we could go about designing the interactive avatars to be displayed on devices. As you can see, we tested designs for half-body avatars on mobiles and head-shots on large display screens.









Environment Design Another important aspect for us to consider was how environments could be designed to incorporate such AI through interactive screens. Below you can see sketches for a futuristic setting with designated billboard spaces which would feature community AI avatars responsible for communicating with crowds on the street, as well as open spaces designed to facilitate a few aspects of the larger goal, such as data zoning.









As to not ruin the surprises of what will be found in the Book of Finished Artwork, Book of Concept Artwork and Codex, we'll keep the rest of the artwork under wraps for now.




Machines that you can have genuine conversations with. That can feel. have emotions, learn and change. The impact it will have is phenomenal. 
In it's complete form, some may see it as the dawn of a digital species, and that will be emphasised even more when the field of robotics catches up, allowing humanoids to exist that occupy the same physical space we do, and when the world of neuroscience catches up, it will allow our minds to also occupy the same virtual worlds of the digital counterparts.
For the first time in the history of technology, a two-way reality-virtuality continuum will genuinely exist, where two species - one created of the physical world and one created of the digital world - will be able to exist in one but participate in both.
The technology, from the start, can be used to an acceptable degree on any modern day computing device, and people all over the world will be connected like never before; they'll experience things that could never be physically possible in the real world; they'll achieve things in ways not previously possible.
The future is approaching faster than you think, and it's going to be awesome.




Perk Tiers:



Basic Perks - Not everyone has a lot of disposable income to contribute, so basic tier perks were designed to make sure everyone could be included in the journey, and, due to how basic tier perks work, regardless of which one is claimed, everyone receives the Immortality perk.

Standard Perks - Standard perks are for those able to contribute a bit more, All standard perks come with all basic perk rewards but are limited in number.

Special Perks - Special perks come with all basic perks, all standard perks, and are for those who want to help influence the coming technology or capitalise on it as early as possible.

Perk Details:


Limited Editions - Book perks - finished artwork, concept artwork and the codex - are all limited editions, with only 149 of each being made.

AI Home System - Though the AI Home System will feature our technology, we do not aim to manufacture it. Given the number of technology companies working on the development of connected home systems as part of the Internet of Things, we'll look for the right partner to be the hardware to our software.

Working With Us - Some media outlets and apparent ""experts"" exaggerate and blow the idea of an AI uprising to end the human race very much out of proportion, but there are valid concerns to be had in the development of these machines, so for those who wish to be a little more hands-on than most and wish to have their say, the ""Ethics Board Member"" and ""Your Input"" perks are for you. These roles are much more involved than one may think - for people in positions like mine, we can be very objective when creating something of this nature, and the subjective role of non-developers is essential to getting it right for real world introduction.

Privileged Access - Finally, for those with a more commercial interest in mind, privileged access perks allow you to prepare your entrance into the market well ahead of others. This is especially beneficial to those working on projects involving cognitive functions.

Should the campaign be successful, all users will soon receive login information to their account with us, through which they will be able to keep their details up to date, view updates and keep track of the progress of their rewards.




So, as well as a campaign, this is a trade - I need you to help me get the company off the ground and, in addition to the perks you'll receive, I'm going to publish the first major work of my life, which is a 7 part series entitled Deceptions and Truths: Man and Machine.
Though the campaign goal is set at £50,000, it is designed to be over-funded. Once the funding goal is reached, the Prelude and Part 1 will be a guaranteed release. Then, each £50,000 milestone reached will guarantee the release of the next part of the series. Parts 2-6 should be finished within the next 12 months, so, should a funding total of at least  £300,000 be reached, my first completed works will be available. As for what they contain, well, let's have a look...



Deceptions and Truths: Man and Machine
I don't write for scientists. I don't write for mathematicians. I don't write for university professors and PhD candidates. I write for the everyday man and woman, so you won't find a ton of confusing jargon littered throughout any of these that leaves you bored and confused. None of the following are your usual boring academic papers, as you can probably tell by how freakin' cool the covers look. I want people who do not specialise in any of the associated fields to be able to read my work and understand it. Everything is explained in great detail, with use of diagrams, analogies, examples and pop culture references where I can, so you really get the picture. I also write candidly and conversationally because I, myself, absolutely hate reading, so trust me when I say I've made this as easy and as interesting to read as I possibly could.
Most of this is the ultimate no-college-required nerdfest.
 

And so it begins. Destruction of Society sets the stage for six parts that are to follow, covering topics such as the current education system, the problem with modern science, the start up atmosphere, the falsehood that is the ""doom and gloom"" of true artificial intelligence and how most people have been getting it so wrong.



Of all 7 parts to this series, this is my Magnum Opus; my pièce de résistance; the most important part of them all and it holds some of the major answers the world of science needs. There are three main divisions to what it contains:
---
Division 1 - The Framework of the Mind
As you would have guessed, the first division is about the mind, how it is put together and how it works. Some of the content includes:


Why the current definition of consciousness is completely wrong;
The true definition of consciousness;
Full theory on memory and how it works;
Full theory of what it is to think, and how the different tools of the brain allow you to do so;
The seven systems that make us who we are;
The two most important principles of consciousness;
Personalities and mental disorders;
The importance of how we perceive time and space;
The equation for determining consciousness;
Proof of free will; and

Why there is no ""hard problem"" and ""mind-body problem"", wiping them both out at the same time.


This isn't about higher powers, meditation, ascension or any form of enlightenment. This is all genuine science and it was a lot of fun to figure out.
---

Division 2 - Physics of the Universe

Now, this wasn't originally part of the plan. I had no interest in doing physics here, but once I began writing about how the brain perceives space and time, I came across some glaring flaws in physics as it is understood today, so I started investigating, and what I was able to determine will rock the world of physics to its core. It's for this reason that I included the contract with the money-back guarantee if I am wrong. For many, this next statement will be of great controversy, but I can prove it. Einstein was wrong - relativity is a farce. Yes, it's true, and this contains the work to prove it. There are no conspiracy theories here. No flat earth garbage. Nothing that can't be proven or disproven. It's all quantum physics, and I didn't need to use any ridiculously difficult mathematics to prove it. There's no bridge to be made between relativity and quantum physics; what appears to be relativity actually needs to be viewed and understood correctly.  I wrote this part of the series, but especially this physics section, in a way that will let scientists immediately call nonsense on anything that isn't or can't be true. A few physicists have taken issue with relativity in the past, but they were never able to prove how it was wrong, and so, for that reason, I went through every experiment I could find - including the thought experiments - that has been done to prove it and explained it all properly. I include experiments you can do in your own house to see what I am talking about, as well as a few experiments for physicists to do themselves. I even had to correct a few other things in physics while I was at it.
Aside from Einstein's work, I also went after Newton and Cavendish for what is the theory of gravity, before revealing my own theory for physicists to explore, because they are getting absolutely nowhere with what is currently accepted, and I am not surprised in the least.
Finally, I give full theories on the three constants of the universe - time (yes, I disproved time dilation), space and light, as well as a new model of the universe and explanation of how to map it, and I welcome any physicist to call me out on this.

Division 3 - Conscious Machines

The last division, Conscious Machines, features:


The equation for creating machine consciousness.
An explaination of what consciousness in a machine boils down to.

A test for machine consciousness, entitled - you guessed it - Deceptions and Truths. This was a necessary requirement because the current test used in AI - The Turing Test - becomes absolutely and completely useless when a machine has consciousness. The AI just obliterates it using even average learning algorithms, due to the nature of what it is.

The 'Black Box Argument', which talks about the importance of what is going on inside the AI; and
A philosophical piece about humans and machines, relative to the work of Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor called the 'Computational Theory of Mind'. It really was a brilliant piece to come up with in 1961, and it's going to play a very significant role in technological development before its centenary.

There's no requirement of a quantum computer to achieve true AI, and this will teach everyone how it's to be achieved. This division sets the stage for much of what is to come in later parts of the series.

---
So, yeah, Part 1 contains two of the most important logical frameworks in science today - that of the mind and that of the universe. It started off as a 22 page paper about consciousness, and, at the time, was actually supposed to be a solo piece. A software engineer I was speaking to last June said it was good, but that there were many questions left unanswered, so I went back and answered them... all of them. Part 1 is now over 200 pages long, and I include my thought paths and research journey so you can see exactly how I made the connections between it all. Thankfully, none of the other parts of the series will be anywhere near this long, but don't quote me on that because even this part was only supposed to be 25 pages, then 30, 35, 50, 65...
Please, don't let them be anywhere near this long.



With the creation of conscious machines, a significant part is deciding what exactly we want them to do. How are they to be used in our everyday lives? What precautions need be taken to ensure machines stay on the side of humans, aiding rather than opposing us? In part two, I take you on a journey through:



The philosophical concepts that started me on this path;

The creation of conscious machines;
Setting the morals, ethics and goals of a machine;
Virtual worlds - playground of AI;
AI DNA - structure, reproduction and replication;
Relationships with humans;
The human-machine comparison; and
Safe creation and safety measures.

I may also cover robotics specifically in this part, if I feel I have what would be a significant contribution to the field.


    Perception. Introspection. Reflection. ""Who am I"" is one of the most important and, often, most difficult questions for people to answer, so imagine the significance for a conscious machine. Are they a ""who"" or a ""what""? Is there a line? Where? Who draws it? What about mental and personality disorders? It's easy to imagine how dangerous a machine could become if its mind was to become corrupted - Hollywood has shown us such a scenario time and time again. There are many things about humans that must be in a machine, but there are just as many things that must be avoided at all costs. Reflection of Self answers the most important questions when it comes to creating and determining the mentality held by a man-made creation of such magnitude.

    This is the part I'm most excited to write about. The 'Single Point of Transition' is the point at which the lives of humans change forever, as conscious machines become an accepted part of society and the fourth industrial revolution is in full swing. Everything changes, and it's important to know what's coming. People need to know how they will survive when machines start taking over their jobs; how the structure of society will change; what will be done about the housing crises happening in multiple areas of the world; what new institutions and governing bodies will be required. It's entirely possible to create societies that are more utopia than they will ever be dystopia, but people need to be willing to adapt and accept the changes that need to be made. Really and truly, we will be foolish not to, given the current state of the world in which we live, but we won't have decades to adjust as we have in the past, as technological advancement is moving at too great a pace and societal destruction is giving it a run for its money.
Still, what excites me most about this paper is one part - education. How to create lateral thinkers. This isn't going to contain anything about eating healthy, getting good sleep, exercising and becoming an avid reader, for 4 main reasons:


 I eat food that wouldn't be considered of the 'junk' variety once a week;
I haven't exercised properly in at least 3 years;
I haven't really been able to maintain anything that could be considered a sleeping pattern for longer than 2 weeks since I dropped out of college in 2006; and
I can't read just for the fun of it. I have to be reading information that I am looking to use at that point in time. Novels and such may as well be urban myths to me. Fun fact: it took me 4 days to read the first chapter of the first Harry Potter book, and 1 month to read the first 4. Then I quit because I felt like I was dying inside.

There is an actual method to the development of the lateral thinking ability - at least in the way I am able to do it - and it's not difficult to learn, but it will take years to master. It's definitely something that is easier to teach from an early age.

The main reason for me including this is because, in a few decades, it's going to be a must for anyone with a dream. Machines will do too much for people to get by on luck and small scale ideas - machines will probably beat you to them anyway - so everyone will have to do their best to put themselves in a position to see connections where machines can't. It sounds like fantasy fiction, but it isn't, which is why I spent quite a bit of time putting my introspection skills to use and figuring out exactly how I am able to think the way I do. Happily, I can say that it is entirely within the realm of possibility to develop lateral thinkers with the same ease people are taught today, but there are going to be teachers of a few subjects demanding pay rises, I can assure you.
I can't help you with the speed at which you process information, though -  must leave that to the chemists.
The singularity is approaching fast. What do machines require to achieve it? Consciousness is only a minor part of the super intelligence puzzle. It's not going to happen without human intervention - AI becoming ASI of its own accord is a fantasy. Machines will undergo significant evolution even before ASI has been achieved, and they will be made more human than ever, but that is only one side of proverbial coin. The other? Humans becoming more like machines through the use of fully functioning artificial limbs, mechanical organs, chip implants and the like. Only God knows what the world of neuroscience will contribute to this. It's going to be both a terrifying and exhilarating adventure. 
End Game. Man and Machine - the two dominant species of the universe. I won't say much about this right now, as I don't want to ruin the surprise, but I already know the ending, and boy is it good.


My name is Corey Reaux-Savonte (pronounced rowe-sa-vont). I am 27 years old and based in London. 3 years ago, I accepted a challenge to design Skynet - crazy, I know, but I wanted to test my intellect. I had no idea whether or not I was actually going to be able to achieve this, but that is what was so enticing. I find it hard to turn down work of this nature and I wasn't really using my brain for much, so I put my head down and got working.

As I progressed and everything begun to unfold, the sheer power and impact of what I was creating really dawned upon me. To say that this has been an interesting ride would be the understatement of a lifetime.
I've always excelled in education. I was a gifted student and my only real priority was to be top of the class... until it all stopped being a challenge and boredom set in. After that, I only done enough to pass exams, dropped out of college after a year and started a life of teaching myself. Now, I've reached a stage where I really can teach myself anything I need to in a relatively short amount of time.
So, what am I? A logician and concept mechanic. I work things out based entirely on the creation of logical frameworks and I develop the intricate mechanics of ideas. I don't use the term developer or engineer because I do all the mental work but I don't do the actual building myself. There's no particular field in which I specialise, and when the time comes, I learn quickly and apply immediately. It doesn't matter how big, crazy, abstract or seemingly unrealistic an idea is - if it is within the realm of possibility and stirs my interest, I'll take a shot at cracking it. I started off working on ideas just to see if I was smart enough; now I take on ideas just to see how smart I am.
When it comes to what I choose to work on, besides the requirement of a seemingly astronomical challenge, the work has to be based on something that can be tested, proven and applied in the real world. I don't find glory in ideas that can never be brought to life. It all just seems rather pointless.
I like to work independently and that's a very good thing because I have no connection to any educational or research institution or organisation. Due to this fact, when it comes to consciousness, conscious machines, physics and the implications of understanding the universe in relation to the creation of technology, I've had to make sure I'm correct because I don't have the luxury of being able to be wrong - if I am, this company comes crashing down, so I've had to make sure everything I state is true and can be proven.
I live my life in a very specific way. I've never been ashamed of who or what I am, but I am very aware of it, so I keep myself to myself as much as I can. I work every day, without fail. I've done so since I was 24. There's nothing more rewarding to me than completing an intellectual challenge and obsession takes over once I start. I partied myself out from 17 to <21, at which point I started to focus in life. I wish I could say I have worked every day since then, but I have taken a few days off in that time. People do love trying to get me out of my house.



The intellectual work is easy, but no one can achieve success without help, and I've been lucky enough to meet some great people along the way who have helped me meet even more great people, as well as offered me advice to steer me in the right direction. Only they can tell you what it was that made them not think I was crazy. I'm just glad they took the time to listen.

Pete Barker - It all started with Pete. He's an informal businessman who actually likes to help others and has an abundance of business connections to do so - something both baffling to and excellent for someone like myself who hates networking. I was a bit wary at first, due to his enthusiasm and want to know more. It was weird - you don't get a great many people being immediately excited when you speak of such an idea. They usually think you're a lunatic or far out of your depth. Turns out he's a real nice guy.

Dave Parsons - Pete's friend and business partner. Once confirming Pete was genuine, I was introduced to Dave. Like Pete, Dave took great interest in the possibilities that would be once the technology was complete. His main concern was how you prove something like this, but that wasn't explained until I met the next person on the list. 

Tweedie McGrath Brown CBE - Pete also introduced me to Tweedie. During our first meeting, I went over the basics of the idea, which intrigued everyone at the table. Tweedie immediately understood just how great this technology could be, given that part of his background is in the technology industry, in which he still operates, but wanted me to have a second meeting with him which would include his friend and business associate who was a software engineer.


Ketan Pandya - Ketan is the software engineer who Tweedie wanted me to meet. He reviewed my work and thought it was a good start, but said it needed restructuring and to answer certain questions about the human mind and how it makes us who we are. He went on to say maybe I should write a book...

Mark 'Barney' Battles - Mr Battles was also at the second meeting with Tweedie. His main focus was how such a thing, if possible, would be commercialised. Unfortunately, he had to leave after maybe 5 minutes as he had another meeting to attend, but, in an email exchange between us all later that night, he was able to introduce me to...

Nick Kounoupias - The go-to guy for intellectual property situations. I was introduced to him through Mark Battles. With more than 30 years experience in the field, Nick - along with another IP attorney friend of his, Tony Pluckrose - helped me gain a better understanding of how to protect my inventions and my work.
Unfortunately, not everyone I met was a believer (as you would expect), with one person even telling me that I had no chance at solving this because not even companies the size of Google and NASA have been able to over the years with their thousands of engineers, and that I should aim lower and focus on changing my ""local area"" first. They then went on to say that maybe one day they'll look back and kick themselves for not getting involved...
There's a valuable lesson to be learnt when writing off the little guy who sits in his house all day, working on things many thought were improbable, for the simple fact that others haven't been able to figure it out yet.
 




I've begun to amass quite an IP portfolio since I started this.. The image above is some of my patent portfolio. I'd be lying if I said there wasn't any hiccups along the way, so let's go over a few of them:


The first patent - the telecommunication system. Took me 13 months to complete. You can see it here. This is what would be the ""body"" of a Skynet-like system, available everywhere to help whenever needed in your daily lives. This is what supersedes the internet. The hiccup here was a relatively small one, based around the requirements for writing claims, specificity and some generalizations. These were all fixed.

Now, the second patent was a real ride, and you can see it here. It's the early stage of my working on the conscious mind of a machine. I had figured out the basis for it in this patent, but not fully flushed out the idea in its entirety. The hiccup with this patent was more of a self-inflicted wound, based on a lack of understanding and me trying to be a smart-arse when I rewrote my claims horrifically. All I can say is that I am truly thankful for the patent system allowing the modification of claims after filing.
Patent number 3 - this one was pulled because advancements later on allowed me to improve it, and later became patent number 7(?) I do believe.
By this point, I was ready to tackle the patent system properly, thanks to further studying of how it worked and the rather helpful staff at the UK patent office, and I was going for gold. So, what other technologies concerning the mind of a machine have do I have pending patents for?To name some: the conscious mind, subconscious mind, instincts, intuition, ideas and trains of thought, the AI genome, reproduction, relationships, trust, secrets, emotions, feelings, reactions, morals and ethics, pain, pleasure, imagination and dreams.






The year 2020 is going to be very significant for technology, as it is predicted to be the new beginning for the mainstream acceptance of what has been in development for many years, such as service drones and the Internet of Things, so, naturally, REZIINE is aiming to unveil the first edition of our conscious AI mind in the summer. However, there's much to do before that time comes, and here's a rough estimate of the timeline that we aim to follow:



January 2017 - Begin Recruitment


March/April 2017 - Begin Development


June 2017 - Showcase Initial Prototype


July 2017 - Ethics Board Creation


January 2018 - Ethics and Morals Configuration


September 2018 - Internal Scenario Testing Begins


March 2019 - Alpha Testing Begins


July 2019 - Early Developer Access


January 2020 - Personal Companion Home System Development


March 2020 - Beta Testing Begins


July 2020 - Final Delivery of Perks


August 2020 - Launch Event


September 2020 - Initial Product Release





Ah, the risks. What are the risks associated with an AI that can think like a human, as well as the company developing it. Let's take a look:
Safety: Of course, the dreaded cybernetic revolt. Something blown way out of proportion, but prevention is better than cure, which is why I've gone about designing multiple fail-safes to ensure this doesn't happen and, worst case scenario, can be shut down immediately. Very few of these are listed in the patents, and most are kept to myself for obvious security reasons. I cannot begin to describe how many things can inadvertently go wrong if someone who has no idea what they are doing tries to create this.
Transparency: Needless to say, events in recent times have meant operations in certain industries need to be as transparent as possible. The regulation of AI is no exception, and so, aside from security measures designed to prevent our systems being compromised, REZIINE offers full transparency into our actions.
Privacy and Trust: For reasons described in Prelude, privacy is of the utmost importance and encryption is not something to be slept on, which is why protocols have been designed to ensure a user's data can and will always be protected between source and destination. Ultimately, your data stays between you and your AI. I don't care for it because my company doesn't sell adverts based on it and will never need to, so your information is protected whilst still allowing communication between you and those with something to offer of which you are likely to be interested. How? Well, the AI mind itself it stored and run on your own device, meaning that your sensitive data learned by the AI does not ever need to be stored on any device that you do not own. Privacy is a must with this technology, so say goodbye to the need to have others storing your information for you.The one thing we cannot account for, however, is PEBKAC-related issues, so, you know, stay vigilant!
 



My brain has been rather busy, so here's a few of the other things I have been working on the architecture for in addition to what has already been mentioned:



Lateral Thinking Machines (Completed) - The next step in the transition between AGI and ASI. Here's a fun fact - the technology for this already exists. I was thinking about patenting it at one point, and then I randomly came across an article about it on a news website. It is not being used to anywhere near its full potential. The last remaining requirement to really get this going is one specific data formatting algorithm, and then the AI can be left to learn anything and everything it can get its hands on. Having considered the initial uses and operations in different fields, I can wholeheartedly say that this is going to blow the world of medical science away.

Artificial Super Intelligence (Completed) - With conscious machines and lateral thinking completed, this was very easy. Finished the same night I finished lateral thinking machines, in fact. There is somewhat of a caveat, though - this is not at all easy or quick to build, and I just laugh every time I think about what it's going to take to do it.
Subjective Machine Creativity (Completed) - Computers creating genuine art. Not only possible, it's actually rather interesting.

Controlled Space System (Completed) - This was the patent I previously wrote about regarding advertising. Essentially, it works with the main telecommunication system to, say, prevent a Samsung advert from being displayed on a device within the Apple store, and vice versa. Owners set the rules and the system follows them.


Database Protection (In Progress) - One of the key security features that will be required for the protection of user data. I can't say too much about it, but it is something that helps to prevent data being compromised even if a database is stolen.


Machine Eyes (Theorised) - This, for me, is the most interesting, for two reasons - the first is that it's architecture for actual hardware as well as software, so I have to figure out how all the physical components work, and the second is that it was born out of an argument I had on Quora about the advantage of a machine externally viewing an object on screen, as opposed to viewing it in its own memory. Most users on that thread made the argument that I do not understand computers and that making a machine view a screen externally through a camera doesn't ""magically give it a human mind"". Well, now I can reveal that the mind of a machine is what I have been working on, and it is a small part of the bigger picture. The core of this involves physics, neuroscience and ophthalmology, so boy oh boy am I glad that I ended up venturing down the quantum physics route.






By 2022/3, REZIINE aims to have the complete AI Operating System (AIOS) ready for distribution.
Various timelines predict artificial super intelligence being achieved around 2040, with Raymond Kurzweil's 2045 prediction probably being the most well known. However, Vernor Vinge's prediction of 2030 is seemingly more accurate right now. The technological singularity can be achieved within the next 14 years if the right resources are allocated to the project, but I don't see it being unleashed for at least a decade. I know I wouldn't release it without at least 10 years of extensive testing, running trial and error scenarios constantly, and I'm an avid risk taker. I try to wrap my head around what it will be like, and, with the right people shaping it, just the average everyday life in general can be the most incredible experience mankind has ever underestimated. There's a lot to be done, but we have everything we need - the people. the technology, and the funds - to make it a reality.
 



Whether you donate or not (I really hope you do), I ask that you notify everyone you know of what is about to happen:


Send it to the neuroscientists you know who desperately want to figure out the brain.
Send it to the physicists you know who want to complete the Theory of Everything.
Send it to all the computer scientists and engineers who would love to finally be able to work with a machine that can think like a human.
Send it to the ethicists who want to make sure this project is done right.
Send it to everyone who has a general interest in the human mind and what consciousness actually is.
Send it to everyone who likes to read, learn and increase their knowledge.
Simply send it to everyone you know who wants a future where they have enough free time to actually live their life while still being able to pay the bills.

The future is yours to gain, and you can be one of the first in line to experience it.
We'll also be opening our doors to company employees soon, so be on the lookout for such an update if you feel you have the skill and determination to succeed with us.



Throughout history, Britain has been the driving force behind or a significant contributor to the three industrial revolutions and scientific/technological advancement, and, I'm happy to say, a Brit is about to kick the fourth revolution into overdrive. Conscious machines are coming and it's going to be the first major step in the evolution of humanity as we know it - bigger than anyone has ever truly grasped. Help REZIINE build a future that actually works in the favour of you and generations to come.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey Everyone! </p>
<p>I am János ""John"" Csorba and I want to tell a few words about me and my project. I believe it's a true and just cause but it's also personal in my case. After finishing University and have made a big mistake, money attracted me too much and as it happens it ended me four years in prison. </p>
<p>I've served my time but I would like to help other people not to fall into the same trap. So my idea is to make the JailBreakers' Crime Prevention Center in my Capital Budapest. In Hungary Crime and Drug Prevention is very ineffective, as the government doesn't spend enough funds on it and also because young people don't listen and trust policemen and drug experts when they talk to them in the classrooms. </p>
<p>But what if in a realistic and cool environment, in a prison style furnished and decorated Pub people like me who have the genuine experience with crime and drugs talk with them?! We now the real temptation but we also now the price of it, so the youngsters would listen and would not choose evil over good. </p>
<p>So during the day we would organize prevention courses and in the evenings and the weekend the place would serve as a pub and a place for concerts. And with it's completely unique design it would attract a lot of people. Not just locals from Budapest but also tourists from all over the world. In the Pub there would be good drinks and food with fantasy name connected to prison. Beside this we would also serve small souvenirs as well. </p>
<p>And what if you would like a tattoo for souvenir... In JailBreakers' it's also possible we would make a Tattoo Saloon as well in the Center, and here you could have all the prison tattoo design from all over the world as well the ""normal"" patterns.</p>
<p>The JailBreaker's Center is very important for me. It's not just my dream to achieve something in my life that makes a difference. But this would also be my Redemption, to do good over my crimes. With this Center we could change the life of many young people and also help those who got into prison to start a new life, to reintegrate into society. The Center would even give jobs to ex-convicts, who truly want to change.</p>
<p>So please help me fund the Center. Be a real JailBreaker, who prevents crime and drugs! That's why the name is JailBreakers' Center it's everyone's who contributes to the cause.And if this will be a success in Hungary I would like to make it a worldwide franchise.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need the funds to buy the suitable property for the Center. I've already checked a few places in Budapest, I have a friend who works as a property agent and he helps me in this.</p>
<p>Beside this I need to renovate the place and furnish and design it. And buy all the necessary equipment. I will also need to hire the staff to run the place. </p>
<p>I know I ask a big amount of funds for the project but it's an ambitious plan. The good news the after the Center is ready it would get enough income from the Pub and the Tattoo Saloon. So I could run it without further funds, I could organize all the prevention courses from the income, that part will be completely free for anyone.</p>
<p>Myself personally could contribute a lot to the Center's success. In University I studied International Relations, and it included business studies as well. I am very persistent and I never give up my goals. Hey I went through four years of hell and I am still here :)</p>
<p>People who contribute to the cause would be always welcome in the JailBreakers' Pub. I plan to make a membership card for every contributor and if you ask for it I will send it by post. This card would give you a huge discount in the Center.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The JailBreakers' Center will have a great impact in Hungary's Crime Prevention. The Crime rates would drop significantly as much less young people would get attracted by crime and drugs. Also less ex-convicts would get back to prison as the Center would help them to start new life and to reintegrate into society. We would even give jobs to ex-cons. </p>
<p>And remember why prevention is important- If there's no crime, there is no victim neither.</p>
<p>If this Center can work in Budapest, Hungary then I plan to make similar centers in other bigger European cities then through the world. I think it's a just cause and a good way to fight against crime and drugs.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The biggest risk of the project is that the Hungarian government might put obstacles to it. As now they fight against civil organizations and even universities (like the case with the CEU).</p>
<p>But I hope that democracy will prevail, and you can help it. If I reach enough funds I plan call on European Union democratic organizations to back me against the government by justifying my cause.</p>
<p>And I plan to buy the property for the center in a left wing (democratic leadership) district of Budapest, so I would get all the necessary permissions to run such a place.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can't contribute to the cause by funds please help to spread the word about it. It's a good cause, tell everyone about it. Tell those people who you think would like the idea.</p>
<p>For example: -The fans of series connected to prison - Prisonbreak, Orange is the New Black, Oz</p>
<p>                           -People who would fight crime and drugs. </p>
<p>                           - People supporting democracy and civil organizations</p>
<p>                           -People who like cool Pubs and good drinks :)</p>

I am currently saving up my personal half and if we all work together we can really do something special. Hope to open in early 2017! This is on fixed funding so if we do not reach our goal in 60 days you will be refunded your entire donation! Thank you!-Brandon Jolly",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>While target shooting in the spring of 2014 I identified a
shortcoming to my rifle support. This shortcoming was the inability of my rifle
bipod to tilt and pivot while shooting off of uneven surfaces. I began
searching for a suitable remedy and while there were a few they were cumbersome
and bulky or only addressed one axis of movement. I then turned my attention to
designing something that would solve this problem. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This design is a modified ball and socket with engineered
restrictions that limit the articulation to only the useable geometry. The geometry
allows swivel from side to side, side tilt to gain an upright sight picture and
front to center (as opposed to front to back) to assist in some recoil
absorption and allows the shooter to “load” the bipod for a stable platform for
target engagement at long distances. The design also allows a one-handed single
point to adjust drag on all axis of movement or a complete lock of movement.</span><br/></p>
<p>For example, if the operator is a blackout condition “door
kicker” or dismounted patrol the AAA can be turned around on the rail and the
operator can then mount a second lighting device. This will allow the lighting
device to be locked to an angle to light the operator’s path so they do not
have to use their primary target illumination device instead.</p>
<p>Product Description</p>
<p>The Articulating Accessory Adapter will consist of two major
components and four minor components. The major components will be the parts
that are to be injection molded of Aerospace materials
for strength and weight reduction. The finished product will be manufactured in
the United States, black in color and will have custom cross bolt, knurled nut,
clamp and retainer. The Adapter will be assembled prior to packaging. The
packaging will consist of a small (6X6 inch or similar) clear plastic bag with
a cardstock fold-over seal with instructions, information and price printed on
it.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>I have been working on this project on my own time with
several engineer friends for over a year and am starting the crowd funding stage.
This is the result of many countless engineering and research hours…days…and
months. While there are a few products that attempt to solve this
dilemma none have produced a solution that is as simple to use and as compact
as the Articulating Accessory Adapter. The AAA will transform a standard, rigid
Picatinny mounted bipod into a highly useful tool that allows the shooter to
track targets with minimal or no bipod foot movement. The design is in the
Patent Pending stage and is protected according to the USP&amp;TO laws.</p>
<div>
<br/><p>After funding is complete please allow 90-150 days for delivery</p>

to produce items for ""cheap"", I couldn't believe that I had to keep

Since then, I have found many ways to generate awareness while making it
my personal quest to find an ethical solution. In the process, I discovered

<p>Our campaign goal is to raise $25,000.

<p><strong>Pain Points</strong></p>
<p>These local tourism enterprise owners run sustainable tourism businesses that not only impact their family’s economic development but also contribute to the economic development of the communities they operate in. For example, Ole Parosei is a tour operator in Maasai Mara, Kenya. He spends more than $500 monthly on marketing but only attracts 4 tourists in a month. From those 4 tourists, he only earns $6000. He has to pay his tour guides their wages, cover the costs of providing experiences to the 4 tourists and also pay for operating expenses such as office rent, utilities etc. Most of the money he gets from providing experiences to the 4 tourists he gets monthly, gets invested into the Maasai Mara community. If he doesn’t get any bookings, he is not the only one affected as his community look up to him to bring tourists so as to earn an income. Without our SaaS tool, Ole Parosei’s business runs at a loss and the community of Masai Mara lose out on economic development opportunities.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Part of the World </strong></h3>
<p>Typically, most startups operate from home. The challenge however is that not every home is conducive to host a business meeting; has access to internet facility or other office equipment that can make doing business easy.</p>
<p>For a lot of Startups in our part of the world, when you leave your home environment, you cannot pick or make calls and have business meetings on your phone because commuting from one place to the other (depending on your city) could be loud and inappropriate for business calls. So you need someone who can pick your calls all day.</p>
<p>Which part of the world in this? I am talking about West Africa. Our company Masoe Productions West Africa has worked with startups in different cities of West Africa be it Anglophone or Francophone including, Lomé, Togo, Cotonou, Benin, Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, Abuja, Nigeria.</p>
<p>We understand these challenges and over the past 9 years, we have contributed in easing the process for startups.</p>
<p>Over the next 18 months, we plan to set up business communities in 3 cities across West Africa i.e. Lomé-Togo, Freetown-Sierra Leone, Abuja-Nigeria. Youth in this part of the world are innovative and this shows in their achievements and quick rise in their chosen field when they find their way to the West. We want to provide for them what is obtainable in the West i.e. a <strong>conducive environment</strong>.</p>
<p>Le Bureau will serve dual purpose of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Identifying and grooming young entrepreneurs</strong>, whose talents often go to waste in this part of the world as a result of failure to launch (<strong>A BUSINESS INCUBATOR</strong>).</li>
<li>
<strong>Being a launch pad for young entrepreneurs </strong>who have been able to start a business but struggle with the cost of running a profitable business.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Beginning</h3>
<p>Having worked with startups since 2010, in 2018, we started a partnership with Ghana Trade Fair Company to create a project, which would educate and position young entrepreneurs, using homegrown business models as compared to foreign models, which is often not applicable in our environment. Held in Accra, the capital city of Ghana, <strong>“the Pitch“</strong> has trained over 100 young businesses from all over Ghana. So far, we have done two editions, the last held in March 2019.</p>
<p>With the success chalked with ""<strong>the Pitch</strong>,"" we are moving to the second part of this stage, which is <strong>“Le Bureau”</strong>, a community of young and aspiring entrepreneurs.  </p>

<h3>Our Project</h3>

We plan to raise <strong>$140,000</strong> to set up two work spaces in these cities. Funds raised will be used to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acquire a lease and setup an offices.</li>
<li>Acquire office facilities required by startup companies: boardrooms, chairs, tables, front desk etc.</li>
<li>It will also go into the creation of a digital printing press. With this we can offer more communications services at rock-bottom prices and develop small businesses.</li>

<p>Well Hello!</p>
<p>First, we want to say thank you for taking the time to read about our vision. We have had great feedback and eager families waiting for this idea to take flight. We have so many great ideas and can't wait to share them with the community. Let's take a few minutes to go over our plan and how we hope to make this dream a reality!</p>
<p>A little bit about us, we are three local moms that represent a large young family community in Calaveras County. We each have a passion to enrich our community and provide a much-needed resource for our local families here in Calaveras County.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Cheree works from home as a Camp Director along with raising 2 kids. She will bring her passion and vision to this project and will be dubbed as our ""Chief Awesome Officer""!</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Lea is a working mom and has 2 amazing kiddos. She has a background in working with kids of all ages and will be our ""Ringleader of Chaos"" that handles the day to day operations of the business.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nhu is a business women extraordinaire who runs a successful website company all while raising 3 boys!  Nhu will use her creative mind to be our ""Head Unicorn Wrangler"".</li>
</ul>
<h2>THE NEED</h2>
<p>This idea was born out of necessity as we all have active young children needing connection and support. We noticed there is a serious lack of options for our families in Calaveras County. We have the park, which is great on good weather days. We also have local library story times but still, this proves as minimal options for our families.  After visiting other play spaces, we could not help but think we desperately need something like this central to Calaveras!</p>
</div><div>
<h2>THE VISION</h2>
<p>Our vision is to open a play space for kids, parents, and caregivers to come relax and connect with the community. Parents can come enjoy a cup of coffee, let their little ones play all while bonding with other families. Working parents can come and get work done with high-speed internet. Stay at home families can come take a break and refresh.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>THE MISSION</h2>
<p>We want to be a staple in the community and local hub for families.  We want to fill a need and support families who are in the same, sometimes challenging, stage of life. Together, as a village, we can support each other, grow together and making this parenthood journey a little easier. Because TOGETHER we are BETTER!</p>
</div><div>
<h2>THE VIBE</h2>
<p>We want a wide open space with a laid back homey feel. We want communal farmhouse table and cafe style seating with comfy chairs and couches where friends can gather, have lunch, do computer work, all while having a safe indoor space for their kids to play.  At any angle, you would have a full view of your kids. There will be different design schemes separating the adult and kids area</p>
</div><div>
<h2>GOALS</h2>
<ul>
<li>In addition to a play space, we also what to create intentional time which is geared toward parent/child interaction. We want to help engage our families by providing family enrichment time each day and will include activities like arts and crafts, music and movement, or even interactive play like a treasure hunt or planting flowers together. </li>
<li><p>Another idea is to host a weekly family support class where parents can gain tools for raising children. We want to find ways to better support our families in all aspects of parenting because the closer we are as a family network, the better parents we are!</p></li>
<li><p>Another exciting component of our business model will be to create a networking system that will promote local family business. We want to call it “The Village Connect” and it will link to our facebook page. We hope to come out with an online directory of sorts. a</p></li>
</ul>
</div><h2>OTHER IDEAS</h2><ul>
<li>On the weekends or evenings provide a rentable multi-use space. This could be for kids birthday parties or even a local home-based business pop up shop.</li>
<li><p>Babysitter Board/ Date Night Swap/ Rent a Grandma</p></li>
<li><p>Family Movie Night and Family Field Trips</p></li>
<li><p>Mom's Night or Dads Days!</p></li>
<li><p>Have a spot in our space that features a local family business who is listed in our directory so people can get to know you and your family business. Maybe even display some work or items for sale.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a space for working parents to have meetings, get work done, all while having an eye on your children. If our location allows, possibly even a parent drop-in office for use.</p></li>
</ul><h2>FAQ SHEET</h2><p><strong><i>WHERE IS THE VILLAGE GOING TO LOCATED?</i></strong></p><p>We found a great downtown location in Murphys, Ca, that is within walking distance to the park! We are still waiting on County approval but fingers crossed we get this secured soon so we can open the space this summer!</p><p><strong><i>WHAT AGES OF CHILDREN ARE ALLOWED?</i></strong></p><p>We want to focus our toys and activities to the younger crowd. As we will not have a specific age limit, we hope parents will use their best judgment on your child's play needs. We are hoping in the future to expand and offer older children's activities.</p><p><strong><i>WHAT ARE THE HOURS OF OPERATION?</i></strong></p><p>To start, we will be open from 8am - 2pm (Monday - Friday) for the school year. As we grow we want to offer extended hours for after school, summertime, and weekends.</p><h2><strong>COST</strong></h2><p><strong><i>HOW MUCH WILL THIS COST FOR THE CUSTOMER?</i></strong></p><p>Prices will be $10 for the first kid and $5 there after. Adults and children under 1 will be free!</p><p>Monthly Memberships will be $45 a month the first kid.</p><p>Subsequent child memberships will be $10 extra a month.*</p><p>*Memberships will include unlimited play for the month.</p><p><strong><i>HOW WILL YOU FUND THIS STARTUP?</i></strong></p><p>There is no doubt that starting this venture will take community support. As a leadership team, we are all working moms who can’t afford to invest large amounts of cash for start-up costs. We want this to be funded by the community, for the community.  We are just acting as spearheads to get this idea rolling and hopefully, it will be a self-sustaining and grant-funded project once it is up and running.</p><p>The initial plan is to start an Indiegogo crowdfunding account and pre-sale punch cards and monthly memberships. We will also have sponsorship opportunities where businesses, families, or individuals can sponsor an area of the space. For example, sponsor at the ""Sprout"" level for $500 and we will hang a plaque in a designated play space area of your choice recognizing your name. Choose from the Book Nook, Imagination Station, Creative Space, Building Area, Play Structure, or even create your own!</p><p>This will be a grassroots effort that will start small and will grow once sustainable. </p><p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> If we do not meet our financial goals, all monies will be returned.</p><p><strong><i>WILL THIS BE SUSTAINABLE?</i></strong></p><p>According to our calculations, the average needed to be sustainable seems very reasonable given the fact Calaveras County has a booming young family population most of which with multiple kids.</p><p>We also have the potential for grant opportunities once we are no longer a startup. Most grant funds can not fund start-ups. Once we prove this is a community asset that is enriching lives, there is a good chance grants will become available, maybe as soon a 3-6 months after opening.</p><p><i><strong>WOULD THIS BE A DONATION OR PRE-SALE TICKETS?</strong></i></p><p>This way of raising support would be completely an investment into a good cause with the added bonus of discounted pre-sale tickets as a way to thank our early supporters. We are not a non-profit and can not offer any tax write off at this time.</p><p><i><strong>WHAT ARE THE PRE-SALE PRICES?</strong></i></p><p>$40 for a month membership instead of $45</p><p>$35 for a 5-time punch card instead of $50</p><p><i><strong>I DON'T HAVE YOUNG KIDS,  CAN I STILL SUPPORT?</strong></i></p><p>Maybe you wish you could have had something like this when you raised kids? Or maybe you're a Grandma or Papa who would love to see this for your grand-kids? Or perhaps you want to help bring a new type of business to our community? Whatever the case, anyone is welcome to help support our cause. Sponsorship of a play space area is a great way to show support!</p><p><i><strong>WHERE ARE WE AT IN THE PROCESS?</strong></i></p><p>Right now the plan is to use our Facebook and funding page to reach out to as many people as we can. We hope to raise enough support soon so we can start to fill in the space as soon as we are approved through the county. Then we will need to host a few family paint days, move in the furniture/toys, and add some final decorations. The goal would be to open doors in a few months. We would love to be open in early August to help offset the summertime blues.</p><h2><strong>WHAT DO WE NEED FROM YOU?</strong></h2><ul>
<li><p>Buy a pre-sale punch card or membership to help us reach our start-up goal!</p></li>
<li><p>Sponsor a play area to help us get the space set-up.</p></li>
<li><p>Read over our needed donated items list and see if you might have something to donate that will help keep our start-up costs down.</p></li>
<li><p>Sign up for our “Village Connect” and list any resources you know of that will be helpful to our families. At the very least, we would love to have an amazing network directory!</p></li>
<li><p>Join our Facebook page and like our posts!</p></li>
<li><p>Help spread the word! Share our facebook page and pass out our business cards to get people excited about our idea :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Know of any resources that would benefit our cause and mission, let us know!</p></li>
</ul><h2>WRAP UP</h2><p>We know this is a lot of information to take in, but the biggest component of our success will be community support. We wanted to be 100% open and be honest about the hard work it will take to make this happen. We hope that by sharing our full plan you will jump on board and be inspired to help us make this dream a reality.</p><p>It feels so close that we can already see the clinking of glasses at the ribbon cutting ceremony celebrating this monumental community effort!</p><h2>WHERE CAN I CONTACT YOU?</h2><p>If you have any questions or want to talk more, please contact us at hello@thevillage.family.

Adults and children under 1 will be free!Monthly Memberships will be $45 a month the first kid.Subsequent child memberships will be $10 extra a month.**Memberships will include unlimited play for the month.HOW WILL YOU FUND THIS STARTUP?There is no doubt that starting this venture will take community support. As a leadership team, we are all working moms who can’t afford to invest large amounts of cash for start-up costs. We want this to be funded by the community, for the community.  We are just acting as spearheads to get this idea rolling and hopefully, it will be a self-sustaining and grant-funded project once it is up and running.The initial plan is to start an Indiegogo crowdfunding account and pre-sale punch cards and monthly memberships. We will also have sponsorship opportunities where businesses, families, or individuals can sponsor an area of the space. For example, sponsor at the ""Sprout"" level for $500 and we will hang a plaque in a designated play space area of your choice recognizing your name. Choose from the Book Nook, Imagination Station, Creative Space, Building Area, Play Structure, or even create your own!This will be a grassroots effort that will start small and will grow once sustainable. PLEASE NOTE: If we do not meet our financial goals, all monies will be returned.WILL THIS BE SUSTAINABLE?According to our calculations, the average needed to be sustainable seems very reasonable given the fact Calaveras County has a booming young family population most of which with multiple kids.We also have the potential for grant opportunities once we are no longer a startup. Most grant funds can not fund start-ups. Once we prove this is a community asset that is enriching lives, there is a good chance grants will become available, maybe as soon a 3-6 months after opening.WOULD THIS BE A DONATION OR PRE-SALE TICKETS?This way of raising support would be completely an investment into a good cause with the added bonus of discounted pre-sale tickets as a way to thank our early supporters. We are not a non-profit and can not offer any tax write off at this time.WHAT ARE THE PRE-SALE PRICES?$40 for a month membership instead of $45$35 for a 5-time punch card instead of $50I DON'T HAVE YOUNG KIDS,  CAN I STILL SUPPORT?Maybe you wish you could have had something like this when you raised kids? Or maybe you're a Grandma or Papa who would love to see this for your grand-kids? Or perhaps you want to help bring a new type of business to our community? Whatever the case, anyone is welcome to help support our cause. Sponsorship of a play space area is a great way to show support!WHERE ARE WE AT IN THE PROCESS?Right now the plan is to use our Facebook and funding page to reach out to as many people as we can. We hope to raise enough support soon so we can start to fill in the space as soon as we are approved through the county. Then we will need to host a few family paint days, move in the furniture/toys, and add some final decorations. The goal would be to open doors in a few months. We would love to be open in early August to help offset the summertime blues.WHAT DO WE NEED FROM YOU?
Buy a pre-sale punch card or membership to help us reach our start-up goal!

Rescue closure of the company in times of crisis.</h3><p>I started working on this project on August 27, 2020. Due to many problems and nuances, the release was very delayed.<br/>Greetings to everyone who reads this. My name is Maxim, I want to talk to you, please see my project. Even if you don’t want to help me, I’m sure it will be interesting for you to read about what is happening in Eastern Europe. Perhaps you would like to share a link to this project in social networks, in any case I will be grateful to you.<br/>I apologize for the writing style and translation. The main task is to convey the meaning of the message to each audience. The original text is in Russian.</p><p><strong>IN BRIEF: WHAT IS MY PROBLEM AND WHY DO I WANT TO COLLECT FUNDS?</strong></p><p>The problem is that due to the situation in Belarus, our European partners may suffer losses. 2020 has undoubtedly been a difficult year for one and all. In Belarus, amid the pandemic, many private enterprises have already been “closed”. Financially independent enterprises closed in May 2020 so as not to drive themselves into a ""debt hole"". Our situation is much more complicated. We work in the field of sales, and at the moment we have many debtor clients who have not settled with us for the shipped goods. This would not be very problematic if it were not for the sharp depreciation of the Belarusian currency and the “insolvency” of state-owned enterprises. A more detailed description of our business will be in the main article below. Due to the economic situation in the country, our company cannot continue its activities. And even if I managed to raise money to save our company, I would not be able to use it in Belarus. One way or another, our company will close in 2021, and I want to raise funds to pay off debts to European suppliers (at least partially). We will not see this money, but our conscience will be clear.  After all, the only thing should be 100% - our European partners should not suffer because of the Belarusian problems.</p><p><strong>IN BRIEF: WHY DIES BELARUSIAN BUSINESS?</strong></p><p>All Belarusian companies have been maintaining trade relations for many years on the condition of deferred payment for the shipped goods. If in neighboring countries there is such an opportunity to do business, then payment methods are strictly and punctually observed. Everything is different with us. As a rule, no one complies with the conditions set out in the contract. And since we trade in imported goods, the shipped goods will be devalued in Belarusian rubles at the time of payment. There are times when money for a shipped product is returned within several years.</p><p><strong>IN BRIEF: HOW DID WE GET STARTED AND HOW DO WE WORK NOW?</strong></p><p>Our business is very simple. We buy goods in Europe and sell them in Belarus. The product is good and of high quality. For a long time, the management of many enterprises adhered to the opinion that uninterrupted production of products can be carried out only on high-quality serviced equipment. And what is most important, thanks to the quality of consumables for this equipment, which we supply. Until a certain time, there was a stable economic situation in Belarus, and our clients had the opportunity to pay on time. Then in 2011 there was an economic crisis. But it was possible to work. Difficulties began in 2015-2016. When many state-owned enterprises stopped paying for the goods on time. At the same time, the unspoken rule “buy the cheapest” appeared in state-owned companies. And in 2018, a decree was issued ""On the financial recovery of agricultural enterprises."" According to this decree, the agricultural company (and these are our main clients) receives an additional grace period for 3 years (after the court decision), and then pays the debt in installments over 5 years.</p><p><strong>OK, YOU HAVE A LOT OF DEBTORS. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ALL OF THE DEBTOR, PAYMENT FOR THE GOODS ANY TIME SOON?</strong></p><p>This is a very good question. Although this is not possible due to the economic situation in the country, it is still possible to imagine a similar situation. The main thing is to take into account the most important thing - exchange rates. If the debtors paid the debt immediately after shipment (or at least within a month), we would be at least a little in the black. If the debtors paid their debts now, it would undoubtedly be great, but we are still in the red, because the goods that were previously shipped are now more expensive, because the Belarusian ruble has depreciated greatly. Out of all our customers, only 10% are working honestly, the other 30% do not pay more than 90 days, 25% do not pay more than 200 days, 15% do not pay more than 1,000 days and 20% do not pay at all.</p><p>From the graph below you can see that the euro and the dollar against the Belarusian ruble is growing, not falling. Data:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617046266/sirweeehmrg9rldk6htl.png"" src=""""/></p><p>As a result of what has been paid for 3 months or more from the date of shipment will be devalued. Of course, in terms of currency and obligations to suppliers. And from the point of view of the Belarusian legislation, we have a profit, and we must pay taxes on it. The company is suffering huge losses.</p><p><strong>WHAT ARE WE PLANNING TO DO? AND WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOT GET THE RIGHT AMOUNT?</strong></p><p>First of all, we must pay in Belarusian banks at the expense of the rest of our inventory and property of our company (two cars and one truck). And after that... I don't know what will happen, because we have nowhere to take the money... If we do not pay off, the management of the company faces jail.</p><p><strong>WHY DID I DECIDE TO COLLECT THEM HERE?</strong></p><p>It's simple. This is NOT a STARTUP, NOT A NEW BUSINESS or even CHARITY. Most of the country's population in the near future will not have free money not only to help others, but also for themselves, it is unlikely that they will have enough. Therefore, I want to ask for help from those who earn more than <i>300 EUR </i>per month. </p><p> </p><h2>AND NOW I WILL TELL YOU MORE DETAILS:</h2><p>So, once again, I will introduce myself, my name is Maxim, I am 25 years old and I work as a manager in a private company called KSKgroup. We are engaged in the sale of high-quality imported lubricants and filter elements for agricultural machinery and special machinery. Our initial task is to bring a more reliable and profitable product to Belarusian agriculture through cooperation with world-renowned European suppliers. After all, the higher the quality of the consumables, the less chances of spending budget money on the repair of agricultural machinery. (See Example No. 1) And the lower the cost of production of agricultural products, the cheaper it can be sold to the population, and the more proceeds from export sales will be. Thus, I would like to show the European quality to the Belarusian people. </p><table border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""width:688px;"" width=""688""><tbody>

</tbody></table><p>KSKgroup has a small staff: a director and an assistant director, two managers, two salespeople, two accountants, a lawyer and two customer service specialists. We have three branches in different cities: Grodno, Minsk and Mogilev. In May 2020, we closed the fourth branch in Brest due to the pandemic. </p><p>Due to the specifics of the product, we mainly work with government and agricultural companies. And every year it becomes more and more difficult to work with these organizations. This is not possible at the moment.</p><p><strong>DIFFICULTIES:</strong></p><p>The situation for companies in Belarus continues to become more complicated: waves of bankruptcies, leading to a decrease in effective demand and a deterioration in the business climate.<br/>I am sure that for many, the following information will be impossible, but in Belarus it is customary to have trade relations with a deferred payment of at least 30 days. There are several organizations that operate on a prepaid basis, but there are very few such organizations.</p><p>From the early 2000s to the end of 2007, all companies in Belarus understood that product quality could be the main purchase criterion. Then a “domestic” manufacturer of oils and filters appeared on the Belarusian market. Let me give you the difference in price in euros: 20 liters of German oil - 80 euros and 20 liters of Belarusian oil - 23 euros. And everything would be fine if it were not for the extremely low quality of cheap goods. </p><p><i>My personal opinion: 150 liters of oil cannot cost only 20%-25% more than a barrel of petroleum.</i></p><p>Many factories we work with employ highly qualified specialists and engineers who are ready to use our oils and filters. They understand that when using a domestic product, equipment will wear out and break. But the economic system is arranged differently. Local authorities have introduced an unspoken principle: ""BUY EITHER A BELARUSIAN PRODUCT OR THE CHEAPEST"". (The cheapest is Belarusian). Trade deteriorated with each passing month, and inflation and denomination were observed in 2017. </p><p>+ Government decree ""On the financial recovery of agricultural enterprises."" NOT FINANCIAL help as you might think. The essence of the decree reads: if the agricultural company has not paid the debts to the supplier of spare parts, the deferral is extended for a period of 3 years, and payment is made in equal installments within 5 years after the deferral, without interest and without compensation for losses at exchange rates. And that's not all. Many state-owned companies SPECIALLY purchase goods without payment by fraudulent means in the hope that this debt will either be written off or postponed. </p><p>Example 2</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617047904/qwowapxqof6m6yobj1xs.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617047874/wqfcpslg7whq0cs3pqno.png"" src=""""/></p><p>As you can see, this document presents a debt repayment schedule for our company by one of our many debtors. I will clarify, all figures are in Belarusian rubles. And a little more arithmetic - at the time of sending the goods (and it was 2016 !!!) this amount was 1860 euros, now this amount is 1290 euros. So we have already lost 570 euros, and how much we will lose at the time of payment is even scary to think. At such moments, you have to think not about income, but about how to stop the business in such an unstable state. How not to drive the business even further into the ""debt hole"". </p><p><strong>ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY:</strong></p><p>At present, the country is undergoing a strong devaluation of the Belarusian ruble. And this is the third rate increase in 2020. This is happening NOT ONLY because of the pandemic and the strengthening of the euro, but also because of the political situation in the country. Many companies stop working, so Belarus has very poor business prospects in the coming months, and possibly years. In early September, news channels broadcast the following: In August, the Belarusian authorities spent about 15% of gold and foreign exchange reserves on regulating exchange rates. This suggests that the real value of the Belarusian ruble is even lower than stated by the authorities. And already all entrepreneurs are waiting for the next sharp jump in exchange rates. </p><p>For understanding, I quote the cost of the euro and the dollar in Belarusian rubles.</p><p>Comparison 2020 and 2019:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617048869/zm25nno3np6e3b875jfm.png"" src=""""/></p><p>In just 10 days, from 17 to 27 August, the euro and dollar rates increased by 7.9%:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617048883/u3pxbwznbqceihi3hdcj.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">I will give numbers for understanding.

At the moment, we already owe our suppliers 140,000 EUR, and this amount is growing every day! The debt to the Belarusian bank is 160,000 rubles (about 51,000 euros). I believe that working with our European partners is undoubtedly beneficial to both parties. And it is very insulting and sad that this cooperation can end forever due to the unstable situation in the country. Our plans included expanding the range, larger deliveries - with greater profit for each of our suppliers in Germany and Poland. But now we are at least talking about closing debts to suppliers. I really don't want European suppliers to treat Belarusian entrepreneurs badly.</p><p>Over the past 5 years, trade has reached a minimum.<br/>It's a shame to look suppliers in the eye because they are making less money because of us.<br/>For comparison, I add a graph that shows how much the amount of purchases from suppliers has decreased:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617049354/yiywamht3o6xal3wsozu.png"" src=""""/></p><p>____________<br/>What do I think about this whole situation? What can be done. What could have contributed to further work? And what could have helped the “painless” closure of the company? What are the scenarios?</p><p><strong>Option №1.</strong></p><p>We close the sales department and deal with cargo transportation. We have a DAF 95 (EURO 3) car and a WIELTON trailer in stock. The car is already 18 years old, it is in a deplorable state, constantly breaks down and requires repair. If we work with this car only in the transport sector (if we pay only the driver's salary), we can cover the debt to the supplier in 77 years. It's impossible.</p><p><strong>Option №2.</strong></p><p>Start active sales at lower prices. To sell at lower prices, we need to cut our costs. Cost reduction is possible due to transport and customs costs. To date, delivery of a truck with fuels and lubricants from Germany to Belarus costs 1,500 euros. 1/2 truck - 1000 euros. And 1/4 of the truck - 600 euros. We usually move about a third of the truck - the cost of transportation is 750-900 euros. This has a very strong impact on the cost price. But we cannot do more because of financial problems. If there was an opportunity to pay for at least 2-3 trucks for the transportation of fuel and lubricants, the cost would immediately fall by 30%. And that would be a good impetus for a sales recovery. But at the moment we have no money for such an advance. And one more nuance. Even if you could bring a lot of products, you need a large warehouse.</p><p><strong>Option №3.</strong></p><p>We may ask third parties to invest. Buy a new truck. Bring several trucks with fuel and lubricants until the ruble is fully devalued. This reduces the cost of the product. Start active sales. Then I find and rent a new, more spacious storage room. (Oddly enough, in Belarus it is customary to calculate the rental price in euros.) We can try to ""earn"" and pay off at least part of the debt. However, I doubt that there are investors willing to do this.</p><p><strong>Option №4.</strong></p><p>We can ask for help from people who earn more than 300 EUR per month. (By the way, this is the average salary in Belarus). And we ask for help - ONLY FOR PAYMENT OF DEBT to European suppliers. This is the scenario that I want to bring to life.</p><p> </p><h3><strong><i>If you do not manage to collect the required amount, then what?</i></strong></h3><p>We will sell the remains of inventory, equipment, office equipment and vehicles. The state will not allow us to settle accounts with suppliers, as there is a large debt to Belarusian banks. And Belarusian banks are always a priority. There is not enough money for bank debt. After that, we will most likely be bankrupted and tried.</p><h3>If I manage to raise money, but less than necessary, what then?</h3><p>Same as in the previous paragraph. Sale of leftover inventory, office equipment and transport. Closing part of the debt to Belarusian banks. Bankruptcy. Collapse. BUT a clearer conscience in relation to European partners. Because all the money collected will be transferred to him.</p><h3>If I manage to collect the required amount, what then?</h3><p>If we manage to collect the required amount, the money will be transferred to European suppliers to pay off the debts of KSKgroup. By selling the leftovers of inventory, office equipment, transport, it is possible that the debt to Belarusian banks will be closed.</p><h3>And if I manage to collect more than the required amount, what then?</h3><p>If such a miracle can really happen, then I think it is worth thinking not only about closing debts, but also about the possible revival of our business. (But taking into account the previous mistakes)</p><p>No matter how much money we can raise, we will be grateful. And we guarantee that all funds will be spent on achieving the above goals.</p><p> </p><p>PS<br/>The Russian-speaking population has a saying: ""<i>С миру по нитке - голому рубаха</i>""</p><p>This saying in English sounds a little different: «<i>Many a little make a mickle</i>».</p><p>In German, ""<i>Wenig zu wenig macht zuletzt viel</i>"". Although the meaning is the same.</p><p>I believe that in any, especially a very difficult situation, you can ask for help. I DO NOT WAIT for many people to react to my project, but in my business every ruble is valued. And believe me, even if you manage to transfer at least 1 euro, these are the first steps towards saving our business.</p><p> </p><p>I thank you for your time.</p><p>Best Regards</p><p>Maksim, from Belarus.</p><p> </p><h3>_________________________________________________________</h3><p> </p><h3>Weißrussland.

Der Originaltext ist in russischer Sprache.</p><p>(Und wenn Sie bis zum Ende lesen, können Sie einen interessanten Vergleich mehrsprachiger Weisheit in Form von Sprüchen verschiedener Völker sehen.)</p><p><strong><i>BRIEFLY: WAS IST MEIN PROBLEM UND WAS MÖCHTE ICH FONDS SAMMELN?</i></strong></p><p>Das Problem ist, dass aufgrund der Lage in Belarus unsere europäischen Partner Verluste erleiden. In diesem Jahr ist zweifellos schwierig, für alle und jeden. In Belarus haben im Zusammenhang mit der Pandemie viele private Unternehmen bereits geschlossen. Erst jetzt haben die Unternehmen, die zu diesem Zeitpunkt finanzielle Unabhängigkeit hatten, im Mai geschlossen und verschulden sich nicht mehr. Unsere Situation ist viel komplizierter. Wir arbeiten in den Bereichen Vertrieb, und im Moment haben wir viele Schuldner Kunden, die nicht mit uns für die gelieferte Ware bezahlt haben. Dies wäre nicht sehr problematisch sein, wenn es nicht für die starke Abwertung der weißrussischen Währung und die „schlechte Bonität“ von staatlichen Unternehmen sind. Eine detailliertere Beschreibung unseres Geschäfts finden Sie im Hauptartikel unten. Aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Lage des Landes kann unser Unternehmen seine Aktivitäten nicht fortsetzen. Und selbst wenn ich zu sammeln Geld geschaffen, unsere Firma zu retten, würde ich nicht in der Lage sein, es in Belarus zu verwenden. Auf die eine oder andere Weise wird unser Unternehmen im Jahr 2021 schließen, und ich möchte Geld sammeln, um Schulden an europäische Lieferanten zurückzuzahlen. Wir werden dieses Geld nicht sehen, aber unser Gewissen wird klar sein. Schließlich sollte das einzige, was 100% sein - unsere europäischen Partner wegen der Belarusian Probleme nicht leiden sollte.</p><p> </p><p><strong><i>KURZ GESAGT: WARUM STIRBT DAS BELARUSSISCHE GESCHÄFT?</i></strong></p><p>Alle belarussischen Unternehmen unterhalten seit vielen Jahren Handelsbeziehungen unter der Bedingung der Zahlungsaufschiebung für die versendeten Waren. Wenn in den Nachbarländern gibt es eine solche Option ist das Geschäft zu tun, dann sind die Zahlungsmodalitäten sind streng und pünktlich beobachtet. Alles ist anders bei uns. In der Regel hält sich niemand an die im Vertrag festgelegten Bedingungen. Und da wir mit importierten Waren handeln, werden die versendeten Waren zum Zeitpunkt der Zahlung in belarussischen Rubel abgewertet. Es gibt Fälle, in denen Geld für ein versendetes Produkt für mehrere Jahre zurückgegeben wird.</p><p> </p><p><strong>WIE HABEN WIR ANGEFANGEN ZU ARBEITEN UND WIE ARBEITEN WIR JETZT? </strong></p><p>Unser Geschäft ist ganz einfach. Wir kaufen Waren in Europa und verkaufen sie in Belarus. Das Produkt ist gut und von hoher Qualität. Das Management von vielen Unternehmen für eine lange Zeit auf die Stellungnahme eingehalten, dass ununterbrochene Produktion von Produkten kann nur auf dem Gerät ausgeführt werden, die korrekt und effizient aufrechterhalten wird. Und vor allem dank der Qualität der von uns gelieferten Verbrauchsmaterialien. Bis zu einer bestimmten Zeit herrschte in Belarus eine stabile wirtschaftliche Situation, und unsere Kunden konnten pünktlich bezahlen. Dann, im Jahr 2011, gab es eine Wirtschaftskrise. Aber es war möglich zu arbeiten. Die Schwierigkeiten begannen 2015-2016, als viele staatliche Unternehmen aufhörten, pünktlich für Waren zu bezahlen. Gleichzeitig tauchte in staatlichen Unternehmen die unausgesprochene Regel „Kaufen Sie die billigsten“ auf. Und im Jahr 2018 wurde ein Dekret ""Über die finanzielle Erholung landwirtschaftlicher Unternehmen"" erlassen. Gemäß diesem Dekret erhält das landwirtschaftliche Unternehmen (und dies sind unsere Hauptkunden) eine zusätzliche Verzögerung von 3 Jahren (nach der Gerichtsentscheidung) und zahlt die Schulden dann in Raten innerhalb von 5 Jahren ab.</p><p><strong><i>OK, SIE HABEN VIELE SCHULDNER. WAS IST, WENN ALLE SCHULDNER IHRE UNBEZAHLTEN WAREN BALD BEZAHLEN?</i></strong></p><p>Das ist eine sehr gute Frage. Obwohl dies aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Situation im Land unmöglich ist, ist es dennoch möglich, sich eine ähnliche Situation vorzustellen. Die Hauptsache ist, das Grundlegendste zu berücksichtigen - die Wechselkurse. Wenn die Schuldner die Schulden sofort nach dem Versand (oder zumindest innerhalb eines Monats) begleichen würden, würden wir zumindest ein wenig schwarze Zahlen schreiben. Wenn die Schuldner ihre Schulden jetzt bezahlen würden, wäre es zweifellos großartig, aber wir schreiben immer noch rote Zahlen, da die früher versendeten Waren jetzt teurer sind, weil der belarussische Rubel stark abgewertet hat. Von allen unseren Kunden arbeiten nur 10% ehrlich, der Rest: 30% zahlen nicht länger als 90 Tage, 25% zahlen nicht länger als 200 Tage, 15% zahlen nicht länger als 1000 Tage und 20% zahlen überhaupt nicht.</p><p>Anhand der folgenden Grafik können Sie verstehen, dass der Kurs des Euro und des Dollars gegenüber dem belarussischen Rubel wächst und nicht fällt.

Denn je höher die Qualität der Verbrauchsmaterialien ist, desto geringer sind die Chancen, Haushaltsmittel für die Reparatur landwirtschaftlicher Maschinen auszugeben.

Lassen Sie mich Ihnen die Preisdifferenz in Euro geben: 20 Liter deutsches Öl - <strong>80 EUR</strong> und 20 Liter belarussisches Öl - <strong>23 EUR</strong>.

Im Moment schulden wir unseren Lieferanten bereits 140.000 EUR, und diese Zahl wächst täglich! Die Schulden gegenüber der belarussischen Bank betragen 160.000 BYN (ca. 51.000 EUR). Ich glaube, dass die Zusammenarbeit mit unseren europäischen Partnern für beide Parteien zweifellos von Vorteil ist. Und es ist sehr beleidigend und traurig, dass diese Zusammenarbeit aufgrund der instabilen Situation im Land für immer enden kann. Unsere Pläne waren die Reichweite, größere Lieferungen erweitern - jeweils einen größeren Gewinn für unsere Lieferanten in Deutschland und Polen.

Um zu niedrigeren Preisen zu verkaufen, müssen Sie Ihre Kosten senken. Es ist möglich, die Kosten aufgrund von Transport- und Zollkosten zu senken. Bis heute kostet es 1500 EUR, einen LKW mit Kraft- und Schmierstoffen aus Deutschland nach Weißrussland zu bringen. 1/2 LKW - 1000 EUR. Und 1/4 LKW - 600 EUR. Wir befördern normalerweise etwa ein Drittel eines Lastwagens - der Transport kostet 750 EUR - 900 EUR. Dies spiegelt sich sehr im Selbstkostenpreis wider. Mehr können wir aber wegen des finanziellen Problems nicht bringen. Wenn es eine Chance für mindestens 2-3 Lastwagen für den Transport von Kraftstoffen und Schmiermitteln zu zahlen, würde der Einstandspreis sofort um 30% sinken. Und das wäre ein guter Anstoß für eine Umsatzerholung. Aber im Moment haben wir kein Geld für einen solchen Vorstoß. Und es gibt noch eine Nuance.

Rescue closure of the company in times of crisis.I started working on this project on August 27, 2020. Due to many problems and nuances, the release was very delayed.Greetings to everyone who reads this. My name is Maxim, I want to talk to you, please see my project. Even if you don’t want to help me, I’m sure it will be interesting for you to read about what is happening in Eastern Europe. Perhaps you would like to share a link to this project in social networks, in any case I will be grateful to you.I apologize for the writing style and translation. The main task is to convey the meaning of the message to each audience. The original text is in Russian.IN BRIEF: WHAT IS MY PROBLEM AND WHY DO I WANT TO COLLECT FUNDS?The problem is that due to the situation in Belarus, our European partners may suffer losses. 2020 has undoubtedly been a difficult year for one and all. In Belarus, amid the pandemic, many private enterprises have already been “closed”. Financially independent enterprises closed in May 2020 so as not to drive themselves into a ""debt hole"". Our situation is much more complicated. We work in the field of sales, and at the moment we have many debtor clients who have not settled with us for the shipped goods. This would not be very problematic if it were not for the sharp depreciation of the Belarusian currency and the “insolvency” of state-owned enterprises. A more detailed description of our business will be in the main article below. Due to the economic situation in the country, our company cannot continue its activities. And even if I managed to raise money to save our company, I would not be able to use it in Belarus. One way or another, our company will close in 2021, and I want to raise funds to pay off debts to European suppliers (at least partially). We will not see this money, but our conscience will be clear.  After all, the only thing should be 100% - our European partners should not suffer because of the Belarusian problems.IN BRIEF: WHY DIES BELARUSIAN BUSINESS?All Belarusian companies have been maintaining trade relations for many years on the condition of deferred payment for the shipped goods. If in neighboring countries there is such an opportunity to do business, then payment methods are strictly and punctually observed. Everything is different with us. As a rule, no one complies with the conditions set out in the contract. And since we trade in imported goods, the shipped goods will be devalued in Belarusian rubles at the time of payment. There are times when money for a shipped product is returned within several years.IN BRIEF: HOW DID WE GET STARTED AND HOW DO WE WORK NOW?Our business is very simple. We buy goods in Europe and sell them in Belarus. The product is good and of high quality. For a long time, the management of many enterprises adhered to the opinion that uninterrupted production of products can be carried out only on high-quality serviced equipment. And what is most important, thanks to the quality of consumables for this equipment, which we supply. Until a certain time, there was a stable economic situation in Belarus, and our clients had the opportunity to pay on time. Then in 2011 there was an economic crisis. But it was possible to work. Difficulties began in 2015-2016. When many state-owned enterprises stopped paying for the goods on time. At the same time, the unspoken rule “buy the cheapest” appeared in state-owned companies. And in 2018, a decree was issued ""On the financial recovery of agricultural enterprises."" According to this decree, the agricultural company (and these are our main clients) receives an additional grace period for 3 years (after the court decision), and then pays the debt in installments over 5 years.OK, YOU HAVE A LOT OF DEBTORS. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ALL OF THE DEBTOR, PAYMENT FOR THE GOODS ANY TIME SOON?This is a very good question. Although this is not possible due to the economic situation in the country, it is still possible to imagine a similar situation. The main thing is to take into account the most important thing - exchange rates. If the debtors paid the debt immediately after shipment (or at least within a month), we would be at least a little in the black. If the debtors paid their debts now, it would undoubtedly be great, but we are still in the red, because the goods that were previously shipped are now more expensive, because the Belarusian ruble has depreciated greatly. Out of all our customers, only 10% are working honestly, the other 30% do not pay more than 90 days, 25% do not pay more than 200 days, 15% do not pay more than 1,000 days and 20% do not pay at all.From the graph below you can see that the euro and the dollar against the Belarusian ruble is growing, not falling. Data:As a result of what has been paid for 3 months or more from the date of shipment will be devalued. Of course, in terms of currency and obligations to suppliers. And from the point of view of the Belarusian legislation, we have a profit, and we must pay taxes on it. The company is suffering huge losses.WHAT ARE WE PLANNING TO DO? AND WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOT GET THE RIGHT AMOUNT?First of all, we must pay in Belarusian banks at the expense of the rest of our inventory and property of our company (two cars and one truck). And after that... I don't know what will happen, because we have nowhere to take the money... If we do not pay off, the management of the company faces jail.WHY DID I DECIDE TO COLLECT THEM HERE?It's simple. This is NOT a STARTUP, NOT A NEW BUSINESS or even CHARITY. Most of the country's population in the near future will not have free money not only to help others, but also for themselves, it is unlikely that they will have enough. Therefore, I want to ask for help from those who earn more than 300 EUR per month.  AND NOW I WILL TELL YOU MORE DETAILS:So, once again, I will introduce myself, my name is Maxim, I am 25 years old and I work as a manager in a private company called KSKgroup. We are engaged in the sale of high-quality imported lubricants and filter elements for agricultural machinery and special machinery. Our initial task is to bring a more reliable and profitable product to Belarusian agriculture through cooperation with world-renowned European suppliers. After all, the higher the quality of the consumables, the less chances of spending budget money on the repair of agricultural machinery. (See Example No. 1) And the lower the cost of production of agricultural products, the cheaper it can be sold to the population, and the more proceeds from export sales will be. Thus, I would like to show the European quality to the Belarusian people.

KSKgroup has a small staff: a director and an assistant director, two managers, two salespeople, two accountants, a lawyer and two customer service specialists. We have three branches in different cities: Grodno, Minsk and Mogilev. In May 2020, we closed the fourth branch in Brest due to the pandemic. Due to the specifics of the product, we mainly work with government and agricultural companies. And every year it becomes more and more difficult to work with these organizations. This is not possible at the moment.DIFFICULTIES:The situation for companies in Belarus continues to become more complicated: waves of bankruptcies, leading to a decrease in effective demand and a deterioration in the business climate.I am sure that for many, the following information will be impossible, but in Belarus it is customary to have trade relations with a deferred payment of at least 30 days. There are several organizations that operate on a prepaid basis, but there are very few such organizations.From the early 2000s to the end of 2007, all companies in Belarus understood that product quality could be the main purchase criterion. Then a “domestic” manufacturer of oils and filters appeared on the Belarusian market. Let me give you the difference in price in euros: 20 liters of German oil - 80 euros and 20 liters of Belarusian oil - 23 euros. And everything would be fine if it were not for the extremely low quality of cheap goods. My personal opinion: 150 liters of oil cannot cost only 20%-25% more than a barrel of petroleum.Many factories we work with employ highly qualified specialists and engineers who are ready to use our oils and filters. They understand that when using a domestic product, equipment will wear out and break. But the economic system is arranged differently. Local authorities have introduced an unspoken principle: ""BUY EITHER A BELARUSIAN PRODUCT OR THE CHEAPEST"". (The cheapest is Belarusian). Trade deteriorated with each passing month, and inflation and denomination were observed in 2017. + Government decree ""On the financial recovery of agricultural enterprises."" NOT FINANCIAL help as you might think. The essence of the decree reads: if the agricultural company has not paid the debts to the supplier of spare parts, the deferral is extended for a period of 3 years, and payment is made in equal installments within 5 years after the deferral, without interest and without compensation for losses at exchange rates. And that's not all. Many state-owned companies SPECIALLY purchase goods without payment by fraudulent means in the hope that this debt will either be written off or postponed. Example 2As you can see, this document presents a debt repayment schedule for our company by one of our many debtors. I will clarify, all figures are in Belarusian rubles. And a little more arithmetic - at the time of sending the goods (and it was 2016 !!!) this amount was 1860 euros, now this amount is 1290 euros. So we have already lost 570 euros, and how much we will lose at the time of payment is even scary to think. At such moments, you have to think not about income, but about how to stop the business in such an unstable state. How not to drive the business even further into the ""debt hole"". ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY:At present, the country is undergoing a strong devaluation of the Belarusian ruble. And this is the third rate increase in 2020. This is happening NOT ONLY because of the pandemic and the strengthening of the euro, but also because of the political situation in the country. Many companies stop working, so Belarus has very poor business prospects in the coming months, and possibly years. In early September, news channels broadcast the following: In August, the Belarusian authorities spent about 15% of gold and foreign exchange reserves on regulating exchange rates. This suggests that the real value of the Belarusian ruble is even lower than stated by the authorities. And already all entrepreneurs are waiting for the next sharp jump in exchange rates. For understanding, I quote the cost of the euro and the dollar in Belarusian rubles.Comparison 2020 and 2019:In just 10 days, from 17 to 27 August, the euro and dollar rates increased by 7.9%:I will give numbers for understanding. The cost of a fifty-ruble bill at different times.01.01.2020    –          21,15 EUR01.04.2020    –          17,58 EUR01.09.2020    –          15,82 EUR01.11.2020    –          16,24 EUR01.03.2021    –          15,79 EURMY THOUGHTS ON, WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH KSKGROUP IN THE FUTURE:Since mid-2019, the number of customers who have taken the goods and has not yet been paid for them peaked. At the moment, we already owe our suppliers 140,000 EUR, and this amount is growing every day! The debt to the Belarusian bank is 160,000 rubles (about 51,000 euros). I believe that working with our European partners is undoubtedly beneficial to both parties. And it is very insulting and sad that this cooperation can end forever due to the unstable situation in the country. Our plans included expanding the range, larger deliveries - with greater profit for each of our suppliers in Germany and Poland. But now we are at least talking about closing debts to suppliers. I really don't want European suppliers to treat Belarusian entrepreneurs badly.Over the past 5 years, trade has reached a minimum.It's a shame to look suppliers in the eye because they are making less money because of us.For comparison, I add a graph that shows how much the amount of purchases from suppliers has decreased:____________What do I think about this whole situation? What can be done. What could have contributed to further work? And what could have helped the “painless” closure of the company? What are the scenarios?Option №1.We close the sales department and deal with cargo transportation. We have a DAF 95 (EURO 3) car and a WIELTON trailer in stock. The car is already 18 years old, it is in a deplorable state, constantly breaks down and requires repair. If we work with this car only in the transport sector (if we pay only the driver's salary), we can cover the debt to the supplier in 77 years. It's impossible.Option №2.Start active sales at lower prices. To sell at lower prices, we need to cut our costs. Cost reduction is possible due to transport and customs costs. To date, delivery of a truck with fuels and lubricants from Germany to Belarus costs 1,500 euros. 1/2 truck - 1000 euros. And 1/4 of the truck - 600 euros. We usually move about a third of the truck - the cost of transportation is 750-900 euros. This has a very strong impact on the cost price. But we cannot do more because of financial problems. If there was an opportunity to pay for at least 2-3 trucks for the transportation of fuel and lubricants, the cost would immediately fall by 30%. And that would be a good impetus for a sales recovery. But at the moment we have no money for such an advance. And one more nuance. Even if you could bring a lot of products, you need a large warehouse.Option №3.We may ask third parties to invest. Buy a new truck. Bring several trucks with fuel and lubricants until the ruble is fully devalued. This reduces the cost of the product. Start active sales. Then I find and rent a new, more spacious storage room. (Oddly enough, in Belarus it is customary to calculate the rental price in euros.) We can try to ""earn"" and pay off at least part of the debt. However, I doubt that there are investors willing to do this.Option №4.We can ask for help from people who earn more than 300 EUR per month. (By the way, this is the average salary in Belarus). And we ask for help - ONLY FOR PAYMENT OF DEBT to European suppliers. This is the scenario that I want to bring to life. If you do not manage to collect the required amount, then what?We will sell the remains of inventory, equipment, office equipment and vehicles. The state will not allow us to settle accounts with suppliers, as there is a large debt to Belarusian banks. And Belarusian banks are always a priority. There is not enough money for bank debt. After that, we will most likely be bankrupted and tried.If I manage to raise money, but less than necessary, what then?Same as in the previous paragraph. Sale of leftover inventory, office equipment and transport. Closing part of the debt to Belarusian banks. Bankruptcy. Collapse. BUT a clearer conscience in relation to European partners. Because all the money collected will be transferred to him.If I manage to collect the required amount, what then?If we manage to collect the required amount, the money will be transferred to European suppliers to pay off the debts of KSKgroup. By selling the leftovers of inventory, office equipment, transport, it is possible that the debt to Belarusian banks will be closed.And if I manage to collect more than the required amount, what then?If such a miracle can really happen, then I think it is worth thinking not only about closing debts, but also about the possible revival of our business. (But taking into account the previous mistakes)No matter how much money we can raise, we will be grateful. And we guarantee that all funds will be spent on achieving the above goals. PSThe Russian-speaking population has a saying: ""С миру по нитке - голому рубаха""This saying in English sounds a little different: «Many a little make a mickle».In German, ""Wenig zu wenig macht zuletzt viel"". Although the meaning is the same.I believe that in any, especially a very difficult situation, you can ask for help. I DO NOT WAIT for many people to react to my project, but in my business every ruble is valued. And believe me, even if you manage to transfer at least 1 euro, these are the first steps towards saving our business. I thank you for your time.Best RegardsMaksim, from Belarus. _________________________________________________________ Weißrussland. Rettungs Schließung des Unternehmens, in einer Krise.Ich begann am 27. August dieses Projekt zu tun, 2020. Aufgrund zahlreicher Probleme und Nuancen verzögerte sich die Veröffentlichung sehr.Grüße an alle, die dies lesen. Mein Name ist Maxim, ich möchte Sie ansprechen, bitte sehen Sie mein Projekt. Selbst wenn Sie mich nicht den Wunsch haben, zu unterstützen, ich bin sicher, dass Sie bei der Lektüre über interessiert sein, was im Nachbarland geschieht. Vielleicht möchten Sie einen Link zu diesem Projekt in sozialen Netzwerken teilen, auf jeden Fall werde ich Ihnen dankbar sein.Ich entschuldige mich für den Schreibstil und die Übersetzung. Die Hauptaufgabe besteht darin, jedem Publikum die Bedeutung der Nachricht zu vermitteln. Der Originaltext ist in russischer Sprache.(Und wenn Sie bis zum Ende lesen, können Sie einen interessanten Vergleich mehrsprachiger Weisheit in Form von Sprüchen verschiedener Völker sehen.)BRIEFLY: WAS IST MEIN PROBLEM UND WAS MÖCHTE ICH FONDS SAMMELN?Das Problem ist, dass aufgrund der Lage in Belarus unsere europäischen Partner Verluste erleiden. In diesem Jahr ist zweifellos schwierig, für alle und jeden. In Belarus haben im Zusammenhang mit der Pandemie viele private Unternehmen bereits geschlossen. Erst jetzt haben die Unternehmen, die zu diesem Zeitpunkt finanzielle Unabhängigkeit hatten, im Mai geschlossen und verschulden sich nicht mehr. Unsere Situation ist viel komplizierter. Wir arbeiten in den Bereichen Vertrieb, und im Moment haben wir viele Schuldner Kunden, die nicht mit uns für die gelieferte Ware bezahlt haben. Dies wäre nicht sehr problematisch sein, wenn es nicht für die starke Abwertung der weißrussischen Währung und die „schlechte Bonität“ von staatlichen Unternehmen sind. Eine detailliertere Beschreibung unseres Geschäfts finden Sie im Hauptartikel unten. Aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Lage des Landes kann unser Unternehmen seine Aktivitäten nicht fortsetzen. Und selbst wenn ich zu sammeln Geld geschaffen, unsere Firma zu retten, würde ich nicht in der Lage sein, es in Belarus zu verwenden. Auf die eine oder andere Weise wird unser Unternehmen im Jahr 2021 schließen, und ich möchte Geld sammeln, um Schulden an europäische Lieferanten zurückzuzahlen. Wir werden dieses Geld nicht sehen, aber unser Gewissen wird klar sein. Schließlich sollte das einzige, was 100% sein - unsere europäischen Partner wegen der Belarusian Probleme nicht leiden sollte. KURZ GESAGT: WARUM STIRBT DAS BELARUSSISCHE GESCHÄFT?Alle belarussischen Unternehmen unterhalten seit vielen Jahren Handelsbeziehungen unter der Bedingung der Zahlungsaufschiebung für die versendeten Waren. Wenn in den Nachbarländern gibt es eine solche Option ist das Geschäft zu tun, dann sind die Zahlungsmodalitäten sind streng und pünktlich beobachtet. Alles ist anders bei uns. In der Regel hält sich niemand an die im Vertrag festgelegten Bedingungen. Und da wir mit importierten Waren handeln, werden die versendeten Waren zum Zeitpunkt der Zahlung in belarussischen Rubel abgewertet. Es gibt Fälle, in denen Geld für ein versendetes Produkt für mehrere Jahre zurückgegeben wird. WIE HABEN WIR ANGEFANGEN ZU ARBEITEN UND WIE ARBEITEN WIR JETZT? Unser Geschäft ist ganz einfach. Wir kaufen Waren in Europa und verkaufen sie in Belarus. Das Produkt ist gut und von hoher Qualität. Das Management von vielen Unternehmen für eine lange Zeit auf die Stellungnahme eingehalten, dass ununterbrochene Produktion von Produkten kann nur auf dem Gerät ausgeführt werden, die korrekt und effizient aufrechterhalten wird. Und vor allem dank der Qualität der von uns gelieferten Verbrauchsmaterialien. Bis zu einer bestimmten Zeit herrschte in Belarus eine stabile wirtschaftliche Situation, und unsere Kunden konnten pünktlich bezahlen. Dann, im Jahr 2011, gab es eine Wirtschaftskrise. Aber es war möglich zu arbeiten. Die Schwierigkeiten begannen 2015-2016, als viele staatliche Unternehmen aufhörten, pünktlich für Waren zu bezahlen. Gleichzeitig tauchte in staatlichen Unternehmen die unausgesprochene Regel „Kaufen Sie die billigsten“ auf. Und im Jahr 2018 wurde ein Dekret ""Über die finanzielle Erholung landwirtschaftlicher Unternehmen"" erlassen. Gemäß diesem Dekret erhält das landwirtschaftliche Unternehmen (und dies sind unsere Hauptkunden) eine zusätzliche Verzögerung von 3 Jahren (nach der Gerichtsentscheidung) und zahlt die Schulden dann in Raten innerhalb von 5 Jahren ab.OK, SIE HABEN VIELE SCHULDNER. WAS IST, WENN ALLE SCHULDNER IHRE UNBEZAHLTEN WAREN BALD BEZAHLEN?Das ist eine sehr gute Frage. Obwohl dies aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Situation im Land unmöglich ist, ist es dennoch möglich, sich eine ähnliche Situation vorzustellen. Die Hauptsache ist, das Grundlegendste zu berücksichtigen - die Wechselkurse. Wenn die Schuldner die Schulden sofort nach dem Versand (oder zumindest innerhalb eines Monats) begleichen würden, würden wir zumindest ein wenig schwarze Zahlen schreiben. Wenn die Schuldner ihre Schulden jetzt bezahlen würden, wäre es zweifellos großartig, aber wir schreiben immer noch rote Zahlen, da die früher versendeten Waren jetzt teurer sind, weil der belarussische Rubel stark abgewertet hat. Von allen unseren Kunden arbeiten nur 10% ehrlich, der Rest: 30% zahlen nicht länger als 90 Tage, 25% zahlen nicht länger als 200 Tage, 15% zahlen nicht länger als 1000 Tage und 20% zahlen überhaupt nicht.Anhand der folgenden Grafik können Sie verstehen, dass der Kurs des Euro und des Dollars gegenüber dem belarussischen Rubel wächst und nicht fällt. Daten:Infolgedessen wird das, was innerhalb von 3 Monaten oder länger nach dem Versand bezahlt wurde, abgewertet. Natürlich in Bezug auf Währung und Verpflichtungen gegenüber Lieferanten. Und aus Sicht der belarussischen Gesetzgebung haben wir einen Gewinn, und wir müssen darauf Steuern zahlen. Die Firma erleidet enorme Verluste.WAS PLANEN WIR ZU TUN? UND WAS PASSIERT, WENN ICH NICHT DEN RICHTIGEN BETRAG ERHALTE?Zunächst müssen wir Konten bei belarussischen Banken auf Kosten des Restes unserer Lagerbestände und des Eigentums unseres Unternehmens (zwei Autos und ein LKW) begleichen. Und danach ... Ich weiß nicht, was passieren wird, weil wir nirgendwo Geld bekommen können. ... Wenn wir uns nicht auszahlen, steht das Management des Unternehmens vor dem Gefängnis.WARUM HABE ICH BESCHLOSSEN, SIE HIER ZU SAMMELN?Es ist einfach. Dies ist KEIN STARTUP, KEIN NEUES GESCHÄFT oder gar CHARITY. Der Großteil der Bevölkerung wird in naher Zukunft kein freies Geld haben, nicht nur um anderen zu helfen, sondern auch für sich selbst wird kaum genug sein. Deshalb möchte ich diejenigen um Hilfe bitten, die mehr als 300 EUR pro Monat verdienen._______________________________________________________________________________________ UND JETZT WERDE ICH IHNEN MEHR DETAILS ERZÄHLEN:So. Mein Name ist Maxim, ich bin 25 Jahre alt und arbeite als Manager in einer privaten Firma namens KSKgroup. Wir verkaufen hochwertige importierte Schmiermittel und Filterelemente für landwirtschaftliche Maschinen und Spezialmaschinen. Unsere erste Aufgabe ist es, ein zuverlässiges und profitable Produkt der Belarusian Landwirtschaft durch die Zusammenarbeit mit weltbekannten europäischen Anbietern zu bringen. Denn je höher die Qualität der Verbrauchsmaterialien ist, desto geringer sind die Chancen, Haushaltsmittel für die Reparatur landwirtschaftlicher Maschinen auszugeben. (Siehe Beispiel 1) Und je niedriger die Kosten der landwirtschaftlichen Produktion sind, desto billiger kann sie an die Bevölkerung verkauft werden und desto mehr Einnahmen werden aus Exportverkäufen erzielt. Daher möchte ich dem belarussischen Volk die europäische Qualität zeigen. 
Beispiel 1. ""Was passiert mit dem Traktor innerhalb von 1,5 bis 2 Jahren, abhängig vom ausgewählten Öl?""

Die KSKgroup hat ein kleines Personal: einen Direktor und einen stellvertretenden Direktor, zwei Manager, zwei Ladenbesitzer, zwei Buchhalter, einen Anwalt und zwei Kundendienstspezialisten. Wir haben drei Niederlassungen in verschiedenen Städten: Grodno, Minsk und Mogilev. Wir haben die vierte Niederlassung in Brest im Mai wegen der Pandemie geschlossen.Aufgrund der Besonderheiten des Produkts arbeiten wir hauptsächlich mit staatlichen und landwirtschaftlichen Unternehmen zusammen. Und es wird jedes Jahr schwieriger, mit diesen Organisationen zusammenzuarbeiten. Im Moment ist es nicht mehr möglich.Über die Schwierigkeiten:Die Situation für Unternehmen in Belarus weiterhin komplizierter geworden: Wellen der Insolvenzen, was einem Rückgang der effektiven Nachfrage und eine Verschlechterung der Geschäftsklima. Ich bin sicher, dass für viele die folgenden Informationen unmöglich sein werden, aber in Belarus ist es üblich, Handelsbeziehungen mit einer aufgeschobenen Zahlung von mindestens 30 Tagen zu führen. Es gibt mehrere Organisationen, die auf Prepaid-Basis arbeiten, aber es gibt nur sehr wenige solcher Organisationen.Von Anfang der 2000er bis Ende 2007 haben alle Unternehmen in Belarus verstanden, dass die Qualität eines Produkts möglicherweise das Hauptkaufkriterium ist. Dann erschien ein ""inländischer"" Hersteller von Ölen und Filtern auf dem belarussischen Markt. Lassen Sie mich Ihnen die Preisdifferenz in Euro geben: 20 Liter deutsches Öl - 80 EUR und 20 Liter belarussisches Öl - 23 EUR. Und alles wäre in Ordnung, wenn es nicht für die extrem niedrige Qualität von billigen Waren sind.Viele der Fabriken, mit denen wir arbeiten hochqualifizierte Spezialisten und Ingenieure, die bereit sind, unser Öl und unsere Filter verwenden. Sie verstehen, dass ein inländisches Produkt verwenden, Ausrüstung verschleißen und brechen. Aber das ökonomische System ist anders strukturiert. Die lokalen Behörden haben in den unausgesprochenen Prinzip eingeführt: „KAUFEN ENTWEDER A BELARUSIAN PRODUKT ODER DIE CHEAPEST“. (Die billigste ist Belarusian).Der Handel verschlechterte sich jeden Monat und 2017 gab es Inflation und Stückelung.+ Die Regierung erließ ein Dekret ""über die Unterstützung landwirtschaftlicher Unternehmen"". NICHT FINANZIELLE Hilfe, wie Sie vielleicht denken. Der Kern des Dekrets lautet wie folgt: Wenn das landwirtschaftliche Unternehmen die Schulden gegenüber dem Ersatzteillieferanten nicht beglichen hat, verlängert sich der Aufschub um einen Zeitraum von 3 Jahren, und die Zahlung erfolgt nach Ablauf des Aufschubs ohne Zinsen und Gebühren zu gleichen Teilen für 5 Jahre. Und das ist nicht alles. Viele staatseigene Unternehmen kaufen SPEZIELL betrügerisch Waren ohne Bezahlung, in der Hoffnung, dass diese Schulden entweder erlassen oder verschoben werden.Beispiel 2Wie Sie sehen können, enthält dieses Dokument einen Zeitplan für die Zahlung einer Schuld an unser Unternehmen durch einen unserer vielen Schuldner. Ich werde eine Klarstellung machen, alle angegebenen Zahlen sind belarussische Rubel. Und etwas mehr Rechnen - zum Zeitpunkt des Warenversands (und es war 2016 !!!) entsprach dieser Betrag 1860 EUR, jetzt beträgt dieser Betrag 1290 EUR. Das heißt, wir haben bereits 570 EUR verloren, und wie viel wir zum Zeitpunkt der Zahlung verlieren werden, ist sogar beängstigend zu denken. In solchen Momenten muss man nicht über Einnahmen nachdenken, sondern darüber, wie man das Geschäft in einem so instabilen Zustand stoppen kann. Wie man das Geschäft nicht weiter in das ""Schuldenloch"" treibt. Über die Situation im Land:Im Moment gibt es eine starke Abwertung des belarussischen Rubels im Land. Und dies ist das dritte Wechselkurswachstum in einem Jahr. Dies geschieht NICHT NUR wegen der Pandemie und der Stärkung des Euro, sondern auch wegen der politischen Situation im Land. Viele Unternehmen stellen ihre Arbeit ein, weshalb Weißrussland in den kommenden Monaten und vielleicht Jahren aus geschäftlicher Sicht sehr schlechte Aussichten hat. Anfang September sendeten die Nachrichtensender Folgendes: Die belarussischen Behörden gaben im August etwa 15% der Gold- und Devisenreserven für die Regulierung der Wechselkurse aus. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass die tatsächlichen Kosten des belarussischen Rubels noch niedriger sind als die von den Behörden gemeldeten. Und schon alle Unternehmer erwarten eine weitere SHARP Sprung in den Wechselkursen. Zum Verständnis zitiere ich die Kosten des Euro und des Dollars in belarussischen Rubel.Vergleich von 2020 und 2019:In nur 10 Tagen, vom 17. bis 27. August, stiegen die Euro- und Dollarkurse um 7,9%:Ich werde Zahlen zum Verständnis geben. Die Kosten für eine Fünfzig-Rubel-Rechnung zu verschiedenen Zeiten.

Über das, was in Zukunft mit KSKgroup passieren wird:Seit Mitte 2019 haben wir viele Kunden, die Waren mit Zahlungsaufschub angenommen haben und diese immer noch nicht bezahlt haben. Im Moment schulden wir unseren Lieferanten bereits 140.000 EUR, und diese Zahl wächst täglich! Die Schulden gegenüber der belarussischen Bank betragen 160.000 BYN (ca. 51.000 EUR). Ich glaube, dass die Zusammenarbeit mit unseren europäischen Partnern für beide Parteien zweifellos von Vorteil ist. Und es ist sehr beleidigend und traurig, dass diese Zusammenarbeit aufgrund der instabilen Situation im Land für immer enden kann. Unsere Pläne waren die Reichweite, größere Lieferungen erweitern - jeweils einen größeren Gewinn für unsere Lieferanten in Deutschland und Polen. Aber jetzt reden wir zumindest über Schulden zu Lieferanten schließen. Ich möchte wirklich nicht, dass europäische Lieferanten belarussische Unternehmer schlecht behandeln.In den letzten 5 Jahren hat der Umsatz ein Minimum erreicht.Es ist eine Schande, Lieferanten in die Augen zu schauen, weil sie wegen uns weniger verdienen.Zum Vergleich füge ich eine Grafik bei, die zeigt, um wie viel sich die Einkaufsbeträge von Lieferanten verringert haben:____________Was denke ich über diese ganze Situation? Was kann getan werden? Was könnte zur weiteren Arbeit beitragen? Und was könnte der „schmerzlosen“ Unternehmensschließung helfen? Welche Szenarien gibt es? Szenario # 1. - Wir schließen die Verkaufsabteilung und beschäftigen uns mit dem Güterverkehr. Wir haben ein DAF 95 (EURO 3) Auto und einen WIELTON Anhänger zur Verfügung. Das Auto ist bereits 18 Jahre alt sind, ist es in einem schlechten Zustand ist, ständig zusammenbricht und erfordert Reparatur. Wenn wir nur mit diesem Auto im Transportbereich arbeiten (wenn wir nur das Gehalt an den Fahrer zahlen), können wir die Schulden gegenüber dem Lieferanten in 77 Jahren decken. Das ist nicht real.Szenario # 2. - Starten Sie aktive Verkäufe zu niedrigeren Preisen. Um zu niedrigeren Preisen zu verkaufen, müssen Sie Ihre Kosten senken. Es ist möglich, die Kosten aufgrund von Transport- und Zollkosten zu senken. Bis heute kostet es 1500 EUR, einen LKW mit Kraft- und Schmierstoffen aus Deutschland nach Weißrussland zu bringen. 1/2 LKW - 1000 EUR. Und 1/4 LKW - 600 EUR. Wir befördern normalerweise etwa ein Drittel eines Lastwagens - der Transport kostet 750 EUR - 900 EUR. Dies spiegelt sich sehr im Selbstkostenpreis wider. Mehr können wir aber wegen des finanziellen Problems nicht bringen. Wenn es eine Chance für mindestens 2-3 Lastwagen für den Transport von Kraftstoffen und Schmiermitteln zu zahlen, würde der Einstandspreis sofort um 30% sinken. Und das wäre ein guter Anstoß für eine Umsatzerholung. Aber im Moment haben wir kein Geld für einen solchen Vorstoß. Und es gibt noch eine Nuance. Auch wenn es möglich war, viele Produkte mitzubringen, wird dafür ein großes Lager benötigt.Szenario # 3. - Wir können Investitionen von Dritten verlangen. Kaufen Sie einen neuen LKW. Bringen Sie mehrere LKWs mit Kraftstoffen und Schmiermitteln mit, während der Rubel nicht vollständig abgewertet ist. Dies reduziert die Kosten der Waren. Starten Sie den aktiven Verkauf. Danach finde und vermiete ich einen neuen, geräumigeren Stauraum. (Seltsamerweise ist es in Belarus üblich, die Mietkosten in Euro zu berechnen.) Wir können versuchen, Geld zu ""verdienen"" und zumindest einen Teil der Schulden abzuzahlen. Ich bezweifle jedoch, dass es in Belarus Investoren geben wird, die dazu bereit sind.Szenario # 4.- Wir können Menschen um Hilfe bitten, die mehr als 300 EUR pro Monat verdienen. (Dies ist übrigens das Durchschnittsgehalt in Belarus). Und wir bitten um Hilfe - NUR FÜR DIE ZAHLUNG VON SCHULDEN an europäische Lieferanten. Dies ist das Szenario, das ich zum Leben erwecken möchte.. Und was, wenn ich kann nichts tun, und es wird kein Geld sein?ENG - If you do not manage to collect the required amount, then what?Dann müssen wir Lagerreste, Ausrüstung, Büroausstattung und Transport verkaufen. Der Staat wird uns nicht erlauben, Konten bei Lieferanten zu begleichen, da vorrangige Schulden gegenüber belarussischen Banken bestehen. Und belarussische Banken haben immer Priorität. Es gibt nicht genug Geld für Schulden gegenüber Banken. Danach werden wir höchstwahrscheinlich bankrott sein und beurteilt.Und wenn es mir gelingt, Geld zu sammeln, aber weniger als nötig, was dann?Das gleiche wie im vorherigen Absatz. Verkauf von Lagerresten, Bürogeräten und Transport. Schließung eines Teils der Schulden gegenüber belarussischen Banken. Bankrott. Zusammenbruch. ABER ein klareres Gewissen in Bezug auf die europäischen Partner. Da das gesamte gesammelte Geld an sie überwiesen wird.Und wenn es mir gelingt, Geld zu sammeln, was wird dann passieren?Wenn es uns gelingt, den erforderlichen Betrag einzuziehen, wird das Geld zur Tilgung der Schulden der ""KSKgroup"" an europäische Lieferanten überwiesen. Durch den Verkauf der Reste von Inventar, Büroausstattung, Transport, möglicherweise, werden die Schulden gegenüber belarussischen Banken geschlossen.Und wenn es mir gelingt, mehr als den erforderlichen Betrag zu sammeln, was dann?Wenn ein solches Wunder wirklich geschehen kann, dann denke ich, es lohnt Denken ist nicht nur über die Schließung Schulden, sondern auch über die mögliche Auferstehung unseres Geschäfts.. Egal wie viel Geld Sie sammeln können, wir werden Ihnen dankbar sein. Und wir garantieren, dass alle Mittel für die Erreichung der oben genannten Ziele ausgegeben werden. P.S.Die russischsprachige Bevölkerung hat ein Sprichwort: «С миру по нитке - голому рубаха».Auf Englisch klingt dieses Sprichwort etwas anders: «Many a little makes a mickle». In Deutsch - «Wenig zu wenig macht zuletzt viel». Obwohl die Bedeutung gleich ist.Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass in jedem, vor allem eine sehr schwierigen Situation, Sie um Hilfe bitten können. Ich erwarte NICHT, dass viele Leute auf mein Projekt reagieren, aber in meinem Geschäft ist jeder Rubel wertvoll. Und glauben Sie mir, auch wenn Sie es schaffen, mindestens 1 EUR zu überweisen - dies sind die ersten Schritte zur Rettung unseres Geschäfts. Ich danke Ihnen für Ihre Zeit.Mit freundlichen GrüßenMaxim kommt aus Weißrussland.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

effects that will result from this shop</span><br/></p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Expand skateboarding - by making product more
available to those who want it, helping to get new parks built and old parks
fixed, by having a place for skaters meet and hang out, and by </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Bring the SA skateboarding community together- by
traveling to different parks and spots throughout the day, posting on social
media sites to meet up with skaters, hosting and sponsoring competitions and
contests, and by skating with people of all ages and skill levels to learn from
each other. </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Enhance the view of skateboarding in San Antonio
skate- by showing the positive sides to skateboarding, showing how it has
positively affected people’s lives by keeping them out of trouble </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Our main risks and challenges
are obvious for anyone who’s ever driven around San Antonio a, inconsiderate
drivers and traffic. The truck we will be driven by Mike who owns and drives
the truck everyday </p>
<p>Another risk is having
a store run by people with no retail or business experience, I have been
working in retail for the past 4 years, since I was 16, 2 of those years in a
management position. </p>
<p>Lastly, you don’t want
someone running a skate shop who doesn’t skate, Both Mike and I have been skating
for a total of about 20 years between us. We’ve skated in different places
around the country and with a lot of different people here in SA. We keep up
with brands, shops, news, and pros. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We understand that not
everyone can contribute so we will also be having a referral contest. The top 3
referrers (calculated by contributions through your share link) will receive a
personalized SktShp T-shirt. The top referrer will also help design and receive
their own shop pro model deck. Word of mouth is just as good as contributions
and better than any advertising we can do so if you’d like to see this become a
reality here in SA and in other Texas cities spread the word and give us your
support! :D</p>
<p>Follow Us! And let us know if you have any questions,
comments, ideas or recommendations for the shop. It is for you guys</p>

Risks & Challenges
Our main risks and challenges
are obvious for anyone who’s ever driven around San Antonio a, inconsiderate
drivers and traffic. The truck we will be driven by Mike who owns and drives
the truck everyday 
Another risk is having
a store run by people with no retail or business experience, I have been
working in retail for the past 4 years, since I was 16, 2 of those years in a
management position. 
Lastly, you don’t want
someone running a skate shop who doesn’t skate, Both Mike and I have been skating
for a total of about 20 years between us. We’ve skated in different places
around the country and with a lot of different people here in SA. We keep up
with brands, shops, news, and pros. 
Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not
everyone can contribute so we will also be having a referral contest. The top 3
referrers (calculated by contributions through your share link) will receive a
personalized SktShp T-shirt. The top referrer will also help design and receive
their own shop pro model deck. Word of mouth is just as good as contributions
and better than any advertising we can do so if you’d like to see this become a
reality here in SA and in other Texas cities spread the word and give us your
support! :D
Follow Us! And let us know if you have any questions,
comments, ideas or recommendations for the shop. It is for you guys

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>First off, <u>Thank You</u> for taking the time to read our campaign. Kalevala Aquaculture was created by a former paramedic and surgeon's assistant with a passion to bring fresh, sustainable and biosecure Pacific White Shrimp to Metro Detroit. Using our understanding of biology and chemistry along with our desire to give a healthier alternative to commercial shrimp to the area, we will produce new harvests every week, year round. </p>
<p>Why? We are seeking to deliver a product of unique quality with the lowest environmental impact possible to a region that has only ever had weeks old frozen shrimp shipped from thousands of miles away. Using Zero Exchange Method aquaculture and working with a cooperative farm in Indiana, we will produce shrimp harvested on demand of the customer at prices comparable to the frozen choices of questionable quality and safety found in supermarkets. </p>
<p>Water is not wasted. Unlike some aquaculture methods, the only replenishment needed in the Zero Exchange Method is to replace what is lost through evaporation. For the whole facility, this will usually require less water per month than is used by an average American household.</p>
<p>We should note our product <u>does not</u> risk becoming an invasive species in the Great Lakes Watershed as these shrimp cannot survive in fresh water or Michigan's climate. We care about the preservation of our precious Great Lakes as much as you do and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources approves of the import of this species into the State as it poses no risk to our waterways. </p>
<p>For every pound of ocean caught shrimp sent to market, nearly five pounds of ""bycatch"" ocean life is destroyed according to the U.S. Fisheries Department. Commercial farm-raised shrimp are often laden with antibiotics and subjected to water contaminated with heavy metals and agricultural runoff. Mangrove forests are often destroyed to build the farms, removing important areas that naturally prevent erosion of coastlines. <br/><br/>Kalevala Aquaculture will not use antibiotics and our water source will be carefully monitored to prevent risk of contamination from lead or other dangerous chemicals. Only heat, salt, feed, and biological water filtration will be used in our growth tanks. This Zero Exchange Method technology is tried and true and brings shrimp production into an economically viable range for small facilities of modest crop sizes.</p>
<p>Fresh shrimp also have the added benefit of being much tastier than frozen shrimp. The meat is much sweeter than frozen choices. Our shrimp also do not require the ""mud vein"" to be removed (where toxins build up in commercial shrimp) as it will cook off, and the shell does not need to be removed before eating thanks to Pacific White Shrimp molting cycles making it soft and safe to digest.</p>
<p>With your help, Kalevala Aquaculture will secure a lease of a facility large enough to hold the growth tanks and equipment necessary to produce antibiotic free shrimp in the area.</p>
<h3>Why We've Come to You</h3>
<p>Kalevala Aquaculture needs to secure a letter of intent of the lease of a large commercial space (at least 3,500 square feet or 1,200 square meters) and licensing/permits in Metro Detroit to establish our facility and attract investors for the capital equipment and start-up costs. Essentially, the $6,000 we are seeking from generous people like you is known as ""seed capital"" and is a common requirement for a business such as this when pursuing investment.</p>
<p>Since this is an ""all or nothing"" campaign, if we do not meet our goal, your contribution will be returned to you and we wish to thank all of you who did contribute and hope you continue to be passionate about ideas such as ours that are good for the well being of the planet.</p>
<p>The entire project will require approximately $100,000 to become operational and sustain itself until profitable harvests can be achieved four months after the first sale of shrimp. Each harvest produces more shrimp as the biological filtration medium in the tanks establish, resulting in enough shrimp being produced to be profitable on the third harvest rotation of the growth tanks. We expect to start growing our first crops within three months of securing a facility.</p>
<p>Other aquaculture facilities similar to ours in rural Indiana, Iowa and Minnesota regularly sell out of stock each week when a new harvest comes to marketable size. Kalevala believes this will also be the case in Metro Detroit with over five million potential customers in reach of our facility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if our campaign exceeds the funds we are requesting, the additional money will be applied towards equipment such as the growth tanks or biofloc reactors to reduce the capital required from investors. These additional funds will allow us to lower the initial price of our shrimp thanks to having less to repay in loans.</p>
<h3>The Perks: or, the Neat Stuff We're Offering You.</h3>
<p>Your contributions to our dream mean a lot to us! We understand your donations to our campaign have come from your own hard work and no matter how much you give, we want to recognize you for your help. Any amount you give will earn you a place on our ""Wall of Fame"" both on our website and a plaque in the facility and discounts on purchases of our shrimp.</p>
<p>For certain amounts, we offer ""Distant"" and ""Local"" perk packages. Since it is not possible to ship our shrimp great distances fresh (and also defeating the purpose of locally grown food), the ""Distant"" perks include more branded items while the ""Local"" perks include free shrimp, discount coupons and tours of the facility. If you live far from the Detroit area but have family or friends in the area that you would like to pass local perks to, please know the coupons <u>are</u> transferable. </p>
<p>We hope you find a perk that you enjoy! Your generosity means the world to us and we want you to be satisfied both in knowing you're helping bring sustainable aquaculture to Metro Detroit and in our expression of thanking you for believing in our mission.</p>
<h3>It's not Just About Kalevala Aquaculture, it's About the Future</h3>
<p>While our primary goal is to produce the tastiest, freshest shrimp anyone in Metro Detroit has ever seen, we also plan to assist other burgeoning aquaculture facilities throughout the Midwest to become successful. To us, there is no competition when it comes to others helping protect our environment and human health. We dream of every major city having locally grown shrimp and we will do what we can to make it happen. </p>
<p>Schools and universities will have access to our facility to help them develop their own aquaculture programs and research how to improve the efficiency of the Zero Exchange Method for future use in other seafood and possibly aquaponics. We will also welcome experimental technologies such as solar water heating into our facility to further reduce the impact our farm will have on the environment. </p>
<p>We also hope to expand by the fourth year of production to double our output so that restaurants that use sustainable foods in the area will have an opportunity to offer locally produced shrimp to their customers.</p>
<p>Kalevala Aquaculture will also contribute a certain amount of our profits to support local causes such as Great Lakes conservation and community gardens.  Our aim is to eventually invest twenty percent of our profits into causes in the region.</p>
<h3>Risks We Will Overcome</h3>
<p>All businesses, especially new ones, need to be concerned with their financial disposition. Kalevala Aquaculture has carefully planned our future financial needs and established pricing and labor levels to cover our expenses for the next four years while setting enough revenue aside for unforeseen circumstances every step of the way. We have done the diligence required of investors to establish our ability to operate this business and believe securing the additional funding we will require to be probable, although not guaranteed. <br/><br/>Crop loss is mitigated by the use of a natural gas emergency generator to continue to provide heat and aeration to the growth tanks in the event of a power failure. Should water chemistry change in an unexpected way, safe materials such as baking soda or molasses are introduced to the water to restore the pH or Carbon-Nitrogen Ratios, respectively. </p>
<p>We also have the benefit of cooperation with an aquaculture facility in Indiana that has been supplying shrimp to customers for over five years to assist us, giving us their years of experience in problem solving should Kalevala discover a situation requiring skill beyond our capability. This Co-Op also gives us significant discounts on juvenile shrimp and their feed, reducing our costs to consumers. </p>
<p>There are challenges... And we look forward to overcoming them all. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help Us</h3>
<p>Spread the word about our project! We'd love for the campaign to reach everyone interested in an idea such as ours. We would gladly answer any questions anyone has, regardless of their intent with Kalevala Aquaculture, as developing sustainable aquaculture around the world is bigger and more important than us.<br/><br/>You can spread this campaign to your social media connections using Indiegogo's sharing tools and you can also find us on Facebook.</p>

<a href=""http://www.sonofman.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Son of Man</a> is out to create the best <i>sagardo</i> (Basque for cider) you've ever had. In order to do this we are raising money to purchase a traditionally-Spanish, but American made <a href=""https://www.foedercrafters.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kupela</a>.</h3>
<p>Our company is committed to making and sharing the best product possible. Fermenting in wood gives soul to cider. Kupelas are traditional wooden fermenting vessels used to make cider, wine and sour beer throughout the world.</p>
<p>Year after year, generations of Basques have made cider in ancient, patinated Spanish chestnut kupelas. While we don't have Spanish chestnut in the States, we can source top quality, sustainably harvested American oak. The interplay between the cider, wood, oxygen and the microorganisms thriving in the barrel is fundamental in creating a living product that tastes delicious.</p>
<p>We are asking for your help to finance the purchase of a gorgeous, 5,000 liter American oak kupela from the skilled craftsmen at Foeder Crafters. The barrel is being designed and built to our exact specs, mimicking the traditional vessels housed in every ciderhouse around San Sebastian. When complete, we will be able to make an authentic Basque style cider in both flavor and process. Wild yeast. Oregon apples. Spontaneous ferment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $18,000 to purchase a beautiful, American made kupela. The equipment will be used to ferment cider and will be the centerpiece of our Txotx parties, where guests will have the opportunity to sample cider direct from the tanks. </p>

<h3>The Traveller Coffee.</h3>
<p>I have been traveling around Asia since I was a university student because of exchange student grants that I have received, and was offered, by the most reputable INGOs in the world. Most programs were in Foreign Affairs Training, Culture and Language Awareness, and even Contemporary Dance Appreciation (Yes, I am a Contemporary Dancer). Since then, I fell in love with many different places, cultures, people and food.</p>
<p>I may not be the most intelligent, but I am very passionate about my interests, such as different cultures, foreign languages and meeting people in all walks of life; that is why I chose to study International Relations.</p>
<p>I got the chance to eat and taste authentic and famous menus/dishes from the different countries and places I was able to visit. Who would have thought I would have the opportunity to taste international cuisines as authentic as possible? But I believe it is because I demonstrated <i>hard work, passion </i>and <i>coffee</i>; namely the <strong><i>power of coffee</i></strong>. When I was a student I would always drink coffee in order not to sleep, and so I could focus more on my studies. From that point of time until now, coffee is my strength and power. Us working professionals need coffee to boost our productivity at work, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>Anyway, to put it up in a nusthell, </strong>I would like to build a coffee shop which will offer many different famous coffees (the best as it were) from around the world, in my area of which I live! With that, I would be able to share my love of different cultures, as well as travelling, to those people who are busy working for their life and their families, allowing them to <strong>“travel the world”</strong> in my shop by giving them a taste of different coffees from around the world. <strong><i>Wouldn’t it be amazing: simply sitting in one place sipping your coffee, but feeling like you've traveled around the world?</i></strong> That is my business dream.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>With that being said, we need to raise at least $20,000 for this start-up coffee shop, to introduce famous coffees from around the world.</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding from all the sweat and time it will take to have The Traveller Coffee to start brewing, we want to get beans open without going to the bank and asking for a loan from people who don't really share our vision.</p>
<p>I already have a commercial space that I will use, but it still needs to be renovated for it to be more appealing and conducive for those travelers. And it's good to note that my location is in a very nice spot for tourists and whatnot as it is considered a hidden gem of the Philippines. It is also one of the best places to surf and swim because of its majestic waves. You can find it on the map, Catanduanes, Philippines. More so, I will still need to have coffee machines and grinders, and to get my suppliers for the beans. I studied and marketed as to where will I buy those ingredients to be used for the international recipes that I will offer in the coffee shop.</p>

</div>Hey! I'm Jett Murdock, a high school student from California, and I am representing Avjord Organics! We are raising money to help cover the startup costs of a real company for real adventurers. We were sick of all the ""healthy"" snack foods with flours, syrups, and high-glycemic sweetners, which wreck your health. Go into almost any health food store and you will find this in most of the packaged products. We here at Avjord have always loved adventure, fitness, and the earth that lets us experience it. Avjord (roughly meaning ""of soil"" in Norwegian) was created to provide real, nourishing snack to support our adventures, made with ingredients like organic mineral rich figs, organic creamy coconut, and rich, fair trade cacao, with no added isolated sweetners like brown rice syrup.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Shortly after my staff and I lost our jobs after Hurricane Irma, I had a vision of working with my old team, by operating our own hotel.  We are all highly qualified and what a movie it would make!  I soon realized that, although entirely possible, it was not realistic.  I decided to focus on creating a temp agency to assist in getting my team back on their feet.   For some burning reason, I needed to have ""karma"" in the name, but it is out of emotional intelligence that I will keep that a secret for now.  After throwing the name around, I found that both Karma Lodging Company and <a href=""http://karmalodging.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">karmalodging.com</a> were not owned.   It took several months of incorporation, branding, video production and social media preparation to move forward.   My sincerest wish is that we can still provide help to those that are waiting to return to work and a healthy livelihood.</p>

<p>The ""Karma is a Pitch"" campaign consists of a 90-day, $25,000 budget.  The core of the budget, $10,000, is allocated to sales, marketing and mass media focusing on gaining hotel clients to fulfill their temporary and future human resources needs.   Perks are allocated the next 20% at $5,000, The remaining allocations are:  $4,000 to float temp agency payroll for the first 2 weeks; $2,000 for 90-day office lease; $2,000 for 90-day office payroll; $1500.00 for Indiegogo Fees; and $500 for 90-day phone, utilities, supplies.</p>
<h2>Campaign Perks</h2>
<p>It takes a lot of effort to come up with perks when you have no physical product to offer.  Our product is people.  We are starting with some exciting perks, some of which are exclusive and limited including ""Karma is a Pitch"" wristbands and serialized ""Karma is a Pitch"" challenge coins.  I am also offering Kaizen-based hospitality consulting services and invitations to our post-campaign picnic at Topeekeegee Yugnee Park in Hollywood, Florida... planned for mid-May.  If the entire goal is not met, the budget will be revised by percentage, with sales &amp; marketing efforts reduced first.  Perks will be fulfilled regardless of the campaign outcome.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>If the campaign pulls one family out of economic, physical or emotional turmoil... it will be a success.  My prediction is, that with full funding, there will be stories of houses not foreclosed upon, food on the table and integrity returned to a desperate community.   </p>

<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>I ventured on this journey with two of my dearest associates and faithful friends, Valerie Fieret and Bibian Thony, whom I've known for almost 10 years now.  We made great headway during our first meeting in December of last year.  Valerie is engaged to be married to the love of her life, Morile Jean on the 22nd of April.   I met Valerie and Bibian in November of 2009 after taking over the housekeeping operations at the Shore Club in Miami Beach.   They both served as in-house security officers for the high-profile hotel.  After observing Valerie's presence and strength of character, I swiftly offered her an office coordinator position in my department and later promoted her to a supervisory role over a large common area housekeeping staff.  We later worked together at the Wyndham Palm-Aire and the Savoy Hotel in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>I will share more about Valerie and Bibian once I get a chance to meet up with them after the big wedding!!!</p>
<p>My name is Aaron Hill.  While in college, I was hired at Snowbird Ski &amp; Summer Resort as a Houseman in 1992 and was promoted shortly after to Assistant Director of Housekeeping.  This was the beginning of an extensive hotel management career spanning 26 years.  Even with a film degree in my pocket, I continued in hospitality and by 2001 was leading the housekeeping department at the 1358-room Westin Bonaventure in downtown Los Angeles.   When Hurricane Irma hit, I was serving as the Rooms Director at the historic Savoy Hotel on Ocean Drive in Miami Beach.  </p>
</div></div>","Purpose
Shortly after my staff and I lost our jobs after Hurricane Irma, I had a vision of working with my old team, by operating our own hotel.  We are all highly qualified and what a movie it would make!  I soon realized that, although entirely possible, it was not realistic.  I decided to focus on creating a temp agency to assist in getting my team back on their feet.   For some burning reason, I needed to have ""karma"" in the name, but it is out of emotional intelligence that I will keep that a secret for now.  After throwing the name around, I found that both Karma Lodging Company and karmalodging.com were not owned.   It took several months of incorporation, branding, video production and social media preparation to move forward.   My sincerest wish is that we can still provide help to those that are waiting to return to work and a healthy livelihood.

I originally left because I wanted to learn more about music production so I could write, record and perform my own music at a professional level.

We love our live music, we love creating things, but without the infrastructure for musicians to flourish, they will leave or give up. In the early 2000s there was a boost in the music scene with the Battle Of The Bands inspiring many of us to take up instruments and then go on to accomplish incredible things. I'm not going to name names, but we have Orcadians who started at the Battle Of The Bands and are now in internationally touring bands, just because there was that little bit of a music scene twenty years ago. There is the potential to encourage the next generation to follow their own hearts and accomplish amazing things and I want to make it happen with your help.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>And this is why I come to you, asking for your support. As you can imagine, there is a cost to opening up a business like this. I need to pay for equipment, soundproofing, insulation, business costs (like setting up the company), creating a website, rent and advertising. The good news is that I can apply for funding grants to cover a chunk of the upfront costs, but with a successful crowdfunded campaign I can increase my chances of securing grant funding and get the business opened as soon as possible.</p><p>In the perks, I'm including exclusives that will only be available for this campaign. There's a t-shirt with an exclusive design (to be revealed), a discount card and other more novel rewards. You are helping me and I want to benefit you accordingly, as an early supporter of the business.</p><p>So, please consider supporting Kraken Tunes and we can help the musicians of Orkney reach their potential.</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p><ul>

In the early 2000s there was a boost in the music scene with the Battle Of The Bands inspiring many of us to take up instruments and then go on to accomplish incredible things. I'm not going to name names, but we have Orcadians who started at the Battle Of The Bands and are now in internationally touring bands, just because there was that little bit of a music scene twenty years ago. There is the potential to encourage the next generation to follow their own hearts and accomplish amazing things and I want to make it happen with your help.Risks & ChallengesAnd this is why I come to you, asking for your support. As you can imagine, there is a cost to opening up a business like this. I need to pay for equipment, soundproofing, insulation, business costs (like setting up the company), creating a website, rent and advertising. The good news is that I can apply for funding grants to cover a chunk of the upfront costs, but with a successful crowdfunded campaign I can increase my chances of securing grant funding and get the business opened as soon as possible.In the perks, I'm including exclusives that will only be available for this campaign. There's a t-shirt with an exclusive design (to be revealed), a discount card and other more novel rewards. You are helping me and I want to benefit you accordingly, as an early supporter of the business.So, please consider supporting Kraken Tunes and we can help the musicians of Orkney reach their potential.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

<h2>Domnian Hosting</h2> <p>We at Domnian Hosting want to be able provide the public with reliable server hosting. We started off in 2012, Where we came up with the idea to start a server on Minecraft. The only problem was that we could not find a reliable host so William decided to host it locally on his very own PC. This campaign for Domnian Hosting will help us make server hosting easier in the future and with the help of everyone we can achieve that goal. This is important to us because we feel like the quality of hosting has declined. We want to return it to its glory and make it easy for anyone to have a server.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Funding</h3> <p>The money we earn will strictly be going to the company and that alone. We will not take any money for ourselves. We need around $10,000 or more to make a humble beginning in the world of Entrepreneurship. We need to be able to afford server racks and eventually a small building for our planned Data center. So $10,000 is the minimum we need. We have some amazing perks to offer to you! They range from 3D printed emblems to being a founding sponsor of Domnian Hosting!</p>

We don't expect 1000 people to donate $200, that would obviously be great, but I know people don't just have that laying around! Okay, well maybe some of you do but your not going to just give that to anyone you've never met before. I think its much easier to part with a single dollar than it is many dollars! We do offer perks to help speed up the process but all I would really ask for is a donation of whatever your comfortable with but more importantly than the amount a social media share. Its going to be the power of social media that really helps us achieve our goals. If 1,000,000 people see our fund all we need is 2% to donate a single dollar.  So with your help we believe we can make a dream come true. Keep in mind the greater the amount donated the less of an impact the process fees will have on our overall total fund. Not only is there a percentage fee but a .30 cent charge per transaction. </p><br/><p><b>Sicilian Villa</b><br/>
</p><div>
<p>My father is the hardest working man I know. He worked many years and many long grueling hours as a contractor. I use to work with him when I was younger and we were always the first onsite and always the last to leave. He didn't work that hard for himself, he did it because he always wanted to provide his family  a better life than he ever had.  And I wish I had the means to make his dream come true but I simply do not. He has always sacrificed his own dreams to help others. Well now its my turn to try and give back! After my grandfather past away my father inherited a piece of land with a home/winery and vineyard on it in Sicily. Unfortunately many years ago, the home was destroyed by an earthquake and was left to ruin because our family was to poor to rebuild.  Hoping to build there one day my father went ahead and obtained all the necessary construction permits to rebuild in the Etna National Park which is a protected area. After obtaining the required permits he also had a villa designed. This was 8 years ago!</p>
<p>As life around us changes so do the opportunities and the dreams we once have do as well. The idea of his dream Villa on his families land is getting further and further away. So much so he's ready to throw in the towel and sell the piece of property that has been in our family for generations! I feel that this moment is my opportunity to help my fathers dream become reality. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How You Can Help &amp; Experience a Taste of What Sicily Has to Offer Yourself<br/></b></p>
<p>When my father who was born in the U.S. and is also an Italian Citizen who speaks the language fluently, first decided he wanted to rebuild the Villa and vineyard he also decided that he would love to rent out the Villa and share with others what its really like to be a Sicilian. Not only by allowing you to stay there but also by being your personal guide throughout Sicily. You will experience things that you would never have even heard of while on other guided tours. We have extensive family over in Sicily and they have plenty of home made wine and massive family dinners, you will feel extremely welcome and truly know what it is like to be a Sicilian.<br/></p>
<p>We need to raise $200,000 to fully construct the Villa. The plan is to instead of building a Private Villa and then rent it out we  will do things backwards here. As backers  you have the opportunity to be apart of the construction of the villa from start to finish with month to month updates on the construction progress. But you will also get the opportunity to be some of first to ever stay in the newly built villa that you helped fund.  When you purchase a perk you will receive the corresponding gift or voucher to reserve your rental dates.<b>** Airfare not included**</b> This is an all or nothing campaign which means if we don't meet our goal you get refunds. So make sure you help spread the word so we can smash our goal and move forward.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In short everything is in place, he just needs the necessary funds in order to start construction. </p>

<p>I’ve been a medical cannabis patient for several years. When I first started using it I found myself having to choose between going out, being with my friends, or even just leaving the house, and staying home to medicate. I often thought that it would be amazing if there was a place where I could go, medicate, and spend time with my friends in a social setting outside my home. I knew there were places like that in other states, like Colorado and Washington, that had legal recreational marijuana.</p>
<p>Last year I became ill for an extended period of time and had to choose to medicate over leaving my house for weeks at a time.  At this point the idea for Honey Bee &amp; Wolfe was born. I knew that in order for me to see this idea into fruition cannabis would have to be voted into recreational use, and in November of 2016 it happened.</p>
<p>I need $850,000 to open Honey Bee &amp; Wolfe. I need it for two reasons; I need to be open for a minimum of one year, and I will need general, one time, startup costs.</p>
<p>Being open for a year is a big deal. Most new businesses are only open from between three to six months before having to close their doors. I need to have the money to pay the retail space rent, utilities, my staff salaries (whom I intend to pay a living wage), product, food and beverage purchases, and other miscellaneous expenses like toilet paper, printer paper, cleaning supplies, etc. for a whole year. Another yearly cost will be the recreational licensing for growing and selling marijuana. When the licensing becomes available for purchase I may need more than one license.</p>
<p>I will have several very expensive onetime costs in opening Honey Bee &amp; Wolfe. Cannabis is strongly scented. I will need to purchase and install a ventilation system that will keep the smell down for any potential neighbors and properly remove the smoke from the lounge as it accrues. I intend to offer food so I will need to get any kitchen my retail space has up to code. If the space doesn’t have a kitchen I will need to pay to have one installed for me. There will be construction costs for the facility I rent, at the very least allot of concentrated elbow grease and new paint, at the most a complete overhaul. I will need to purchase initial product, furniture for the lounge, office furniture, a printer, a scanning system for lounge guests and the software that goes with it, specific software to track any cannabis I grow and sell, computers to run the software, etc. There are specific security standards I will need to implement for when I acquire licensing to grow and sell cannabis, a secure holding area for product that is not out for sale, such as a large lockable safe, security cameras, and ensuring safe and secure access to product by only employees.</p>
<p>If the facility I initially rent for Honey Bee &amp; Wolf does not have the space for a grow I will need to rent an additional space and pay the rent and utilities for it for a year as well. I will need to purchase the things to start the grow, additional security for the facility, taxes on the product I grow, anything I manufacture, like concentrates, any other fees and taxes owed to the state, county, or city (if they decide to implement any), etc. All before I can sell any of it. </p>
<p>Honey Bee &amp; Wolfe will be a place where people from all walks of life can come and enjoy themselves while also enjoying cannabis. It will be a place where people can come to relax, chit chat with their friends, make new friends, play games, be they tabletop or video, read, etc.</p>
<p>I will have availability to teach people that want to learn how to make a joint, try out a bong before purchasing their own for at home, learn how to use a pipe, or try out an edible in a safe space.</p>
<p>There are unique risks and challenges to having a business that is in the cannabis industry, especially in a state that is just starting to allow recreational use. Currently there aren’t any other businesses in the Orange County area that are doing what I am seeking to do. I am most likely going to be one of the first. I will not be able to sell marijuana after my initial opening; my guests will need to bring their own. I intend to allow them to bring their own even after I begin to sell.</p>
<p>I’m doing a crowdfund because banks do not want to lend to people that are considered high risk. The cannabis industry, even though it is growing and is doing quite well in other states that allow for recreational use, is a high-risk industry. Mostly because it’s still federally classified as a schedule 1 substance, though hopefully that will change in the future, sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>If I do not reach full funding I will continue to work on other ways of acquiring it. Private investors are a consideration and even though it is unlikely I would receive bank funding I would still try that route.</p>
<p>I know that not everyone going to be able to contribute, or want to. I ask that if you can’t, or don’t want to, share us on your social media or with friends and family. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about the campaign! We hope to see you at the lounge when we open!</p>

<h3></h3><p><b>We are proud to present our invention, our idea and our project
that will literally revolutionize the boating community and the world of RVs!</b></p>
<p>We started with a need that is in fact also a problem and we
found a simple, efficient, and esthetic solution.  We are proposing an invention that will
permit the user to dispose of trash when aboard a sail boat, fair size motor
boat or even a motor home without restraining the space inside the vehicle.</p>
<p>RVs and boats (sail or motor) do not have a precise place where
to dispose of waste.  We wanted to
reproduce the habits individuals have in their home: when the bin is full, it
is put in a larger exterior bin until it can be emptied.</p>
<p><b>This idea arose when the two ocean lovers that we are were
irritated by the absence of a simple garbage bin while on our sail boat.</b>  </p><p>We tried shopping, but no marine garbage bin
was available on the market!  Patrick
thus decided to create a prototype.  We
saw an opportunity and decided to undergo the steps to patent our project.
Finally, as we talked about our project, opportunities for motor homes
materialized.</p>
<p>Some products can significantly transform our habits while
others fill a need of less importance. 
Our invention will fill your needs and will help preserve a clean
environment whether it is in the water or on the ground.</p>
<p>The environment is also something that we are committed
to.  For every garbage bin sold, we will
give a percentage of sales to organisations such as “Ocean Clean-Up”  that have for mandate of cleaning our oceans.  </p>

on Vicky Maltais’ first name as well as meaning “Victory”.</p>
<p>Our slogan “<b>A victory for our oceans!</b>” started with the

<p>I am passionate about everything connected to boating and am
very knowledgeable about the boating world. 
You have a question about navigation? I have the answer at the tip of my
fingers!  I was very young when I bought
my first embarkation, a racing catamaran, and I continued with more imposing
models.  I am at my second patent; I have
the ability to find solutions to recurring problems.</p>
<p>Since early childhood, I have been sailing and have enjoyed the
best moments of my life on water. In the last few years, I bought a classic
sailboat where I enjoy all my summer vacation with my family. Rapidly, in my
outings, I was irritated by the lack of a simple garbage bin. I then decided to
create a model and as opportunities became more and more obvious, Victoria
Marine was born!</p>
<p><b><u>Vicky Maltais, Sales</u></b></p>
<p>I was conquered upon my first few minutes of navigation with
Patrick.  Boating quickly became one of
my passions.  With my studies in
industrial production, management and productivity, I previously held a position
as quality supervisor in the aeronautic field. I am particularly good with
management, planning, sales and marketing. 
In fact, I had previously built my company from A to Z.  This new project is an exciting challenge
since it awakens the business woman in me.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454459893/q2p2dmdhf3tc8tujadmi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3 style=""display: inline !important;"">The Problem</h3><p>When
we are in a habitat, whether it is on water or earth, we consume and inevitably
produce waste.  <b>The disposal of what we consume is just as important as its
use.  </b>Fair size boats which include a
kitchenette do not have a precise place to dispose of waste. </p>
<p>Thus, each boat owner is
faced with the same problem.  When the
small kitchen bin is full, the bag is stored in the chests, tied to the
guardrail or deposited in the zodiac. 
The bags smell and leak and contaminate the deck.  As for the chests, these are used for ropes
and filling them with trash uses up much needed space.</p>
<p>For motor homes, a
similar problem arises.  On campsites, we
must bring the garbage every night to the large container at the entrance in
order to avoid attracting animals. 
Furthermore, if the caravan is in the middle of nature, then the only
place to put the garbage is inside the RV or in the car in order to avoid
encounters with bears and racoons who might be tempted by the leftovers!</p><b><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Solution</h3></b><p><b>We wanted to reproduce the habits individuals have in their
home: when the bin is full, it is put in a larger exterior bin until it can be
emptied.</b></p>
<p>Our RV garbage bin has a look that is similar to traditional
garbage containers.  It has a device that
allows it to hook on and lock to RV and boat balconies in order not to take up
space.  It is made solely of stainless
steel and UV treated plastic in order to avoid corrosion.  It is hermetic and includes an integrated
key-lock.</p>
<p>On a watercraft, it can be placed behind the boat as well as on
the back side or the front.  On a RV it
can be placed on the side handle or on the back ladder. Light, solid and
robust, it is conceived to be weather resistant.  It is also interesting to mention that our
invention could be used as extra storage space or as a recycling bin. Since
waste management and the protection of the environment are crucial to us, it
was important that we found a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>Our invention can even help prolong your vacation since the
owner has a specific place where to put his garbage! Then, upon return, he
simply needs to unlock and remove the garbage bin from its plinth and bring it
to the large container. Also, since it is locked, it cannot fall into the water
or be stolen.  If ever by chance it would
fall into the water, it would float.</p><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454331665/m4dzrrrxvfuydkml8daw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 376.368px; height: 463px;""/></p><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></h3><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Technology</h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""><p></p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Target Market</h3>
<p>The target market is quite vast. First, we have owners of sail boats and fair size motor boats.  Second, our invention will be useful for campers and RV owners. Then, we have boating and camping accessory distributors and manufacturers of boats and motor homes. Finally, rental companies for RVs will see a basic product that can be profitable to them.</p>

<h3>Donations</h3></span></div><div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><p><b>Our invention solves an irritating and constant situation.

<p><b>Since waste management and the protection of the environment

born with the mission of cleaning our oceans. Thus for every garbage bin sold,
we will give a percentage of sales to organizations such as «Ocean Clean-Up»  that have for mandate of cleaning our oceans.  </p>
<p>Also, one of the projects that we would like to eventually set
up is to find a way to use plastics from our oceans to make our bins in order
to recycle that plastic.</p>

<h3>Future</h3>
<p></p>
<p>To start off, we want to offer a single model. However,
eventually, we want to offer our users different sizes, colors, and product
ranges. It would be interesting to have a carbon fiber upscale bin or to offer
models exclusive to boat constructors with the same colours, accessories and
shapes as their creations.  The
possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>The buyer can then have two marine garbage bins on his boat to
put aside recyclable mater.  However, in
the future, it would be interesting to have a compost option annexed to the
marine garbage.</p>

Our slogan: A victory for our oceans!

Target Market
The target market is quite vast. First, we have owners of sail boats and fair size motor boats.  Second, our invention will be useful for campers and RV owners. Then, we have boating and camping accessory distributors and manufacturers of boats and motor homes. Finally, rental companies for RVs will see a basic product that can be profitable to them.

DonationsOur invention solves an irritating and constant situation.
After many international searches, we realized that this invention does not
exist!  When we are in a habitat, be it
on water or earth, we consume and inevitably produce waste.  The disposal of what we consume is just as
important as its use.
Since waste management and the protection of the environment
are crucial to us, it was important that we found a solution to this
problem.  More and more organisations are
born with the mission of cleaning our oceans. Thus for every garbage bin sold,
we will give a percentage of sales to organizations such as «Ocean Clean-Up»  that have for mandate of cleaning our oceans.  
Also, one of the projects that we would like to eventually set
up is to find a way to use plastics from our oceans to make our bins in order
to recycle that plastic.
Costs


Future

To start off, we want to offer a single model. However,
eventually, we want to offer our users different sizes, colors, and product
ranges. It would be interesting to have a carbon fiber upscale bin or to offer
models exclusive to boat constructors with the same colours, accessories and
shapes as their creations.  The
possibilities are endless!
The buyer can then have two marine garbage bins on his boat to
put aside recyclable mater.  However, in
the future, it would be interesting to have a compost option annexed to the
marine garbage.

</div></div>","Our Concept is Simple


Nachos. Who doesn't love them?
Finding nacho enthusiasts isn't the issue. We're everywhere! 
Finding nachos on the other hand... not as simple.

Until Now
 Our goal is to curb your nacho cravings as efficiently as possible.
Sherrol has managed a quick service Mexican restaurant for half a decade. It didn't take long for her to realize the item everyone kept requesting wasn't even on the menu. 
We value time but don't view quality as a necessary compromise. 



Where We Are Now
We (Sherrol and Colette) have been taking a course through City Hall for small business start-ups. We meet with the grant committee next month and if all goes well, will receive a grant to cover a portion of the start-up costs for our business. 
People love the concept and are eager to dig in. The location we've found is close to home, in the up and coming neighbourhood of ""Barton Village"". Barton Street has gotten a less than stellar rap over the years which the City of Hamilton and Nacho Dias are hoping to change. With the rising cost of real estate, Barton Village's price tag is no longer aligning with it's 'low-income' reputation and newcomers to Hamilton are on the hunt for a local hangout. 
In addition to our more self-serving interests (working for ourselves, 5 minute commute by foot, and NACHOS GALORE) we would also love to be part of revitalizing a neighbourhood we happen to call home.
The landlord loves our concept, thinks we are a perfect fit and is eager to lease to us.
The catch?
There are a number of other costs involved in securing the location we've found, which has to be done prior to our presentation next month. We need the grant to get the location, we need the location to get the grant (as a restaurant isn't much of a business without an address!).

<p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to read about my crowdfunder. My name is Esmeralda Camara and my business' name is La Jarana (ha-ra-na) Clothing and Merchandise. We are a company based in Pasadena, CA, USA that works with artisans in Yucatan, Mexico to create a clothing line for guayaberas (wye-a-berra).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Guayaberas are traditional shirts from Latin America, often worn formally. They can also be casual attire. Yucatan is a very hot and tropical place, therefore the clothes are designed to keep you cool and dry, which is also perfect for California weather; they are great to wear year-round for these regions!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want you to know where your money is going and how you will be helping turn this vision into reality! Your money will be going into paying for the first shipment of clothing for the La Jarana brand clothing, the making of contracts for the artisans and representatives/recruiters and finishing the La Jarana website where you can order online.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any donation would help. My goal is to sell in boutiques and stores and one day open my own shop and I will also have an online store. Please help this dream come true, thank you for taking the time to read about La Jarana Clothing and Merchandise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>UPDATE: Because There has been a perk added, in order to break even, the donation goal is now <u><i><strong>$3,000</strong></i></u>, but we cannot make any changes to the donation goal on this campaign because there have been donations made and Indiegogo won't allow any changes once there has been a donation.  </p>

Hi.
I'm Sam. My team and I are seeking funding for a community-led Tea &amp; Juice Bar and called The Living Room, which will launch in Brighton, England, in
early 2016.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448284676/akbkw8wmyxl2w4n12acn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>The
Living Room will provide a little bit of everything; as well as being
a cosy place where you can pop in any time for a cup of delicious
tea, a freshly-pressed juice or a nice hot bowl of soup, we'll be
hosting a bunch of events right from yoga and meditation to artistic
performances and exhibitions, as well as youth clubs, book clubs,
board game evenings and presentations on all kinds of interesting
topics – patrons will be encouraged to put their own events on too.
The focus will always be on coming together to promote wellbeing and
good times.</p><p></p>
<p>
This
is your chance to make The Living Room a reality.</p>
<p>
You
can help by investing any amount of money to make The Living Room
happen, or by sharing this campaign using the hashtag #makeTLRhappen or following us at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TheLivingRoomBrighton"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/TheLivingRoomBrighton</a>.</p><p>This is a fixed funding project, so you'll get your contribution back if we don't reach our target. If you have any questions, please get in touch <a href=""http://www.woto.com/sam_livingroom"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p><br/><p></p><p></p><div>

<p>
</p>
<p>The
Living Room is all about community – our aim is to create our own
community of like-minded people, while serving our own local
community in any way we can.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Other
words that are important for us are care, kindness, friendship and
fun; The Living Room will be a supportive environment where anyone
can come to find themselves, get support and have a good time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
We'll
also be working alongside local charities and organisations to help
them in their daily work of tackling homelessness head on.</p>
<p>If this sounds like the kind of place you'd like to spend your time, please contribute to this campaign and make it happen!</p>

<p>
Just
about everything's in place - the business plan is ready to put into
action and the financial calculations are done to the penny - but
getting a business like this up and running doesn't come for free,
with rent, wages, furniture, and loads of other little things to pay
for.</p>
<p>
We'll
be extremely grateful for any amount you can invest - big or small,
it'll help bring this concept to the world and make a lasting
positive impact on our community.</p>
<p>For example, everyone who invests just £2 will be giving an organic cup of tea to a homeless person, as well as getting their name on a ""thank you"" poster that will be framed at The Living Room when we open. And it doesn't stop there - once we reach our target and get up and running, we'll give a cup of tea a home for every one we sell.</p>

Since
coming to live in Brighton after nine years living abroad, I've been
touched by the situation of numerous people I've seen and spoken to
living rough on the streets.</p>
<p>
I
decided to offer my help through The Living Room, a business I've
been working on and planning for some time – and now I'm assembling
a team of superheroes to finally make it happen.</p>

know we can't solve the homelessness problem alone, but we believe
that by cooperating with local organisations who are already doing
great work, The Living Room can make a significant difference. We
have a number of arrangements already in place with such
organisations – some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	working
	with Business Action On Homelessness to offer training and
	employment opportunities to homeless people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	buying
	our soups from Dine, a kitchen service that provides homeless
	people with training for catering careers and feeds its profits into
	the First Base Day Centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	working
	with various organisations to distribute any unsold food to people
	who need it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	working
	with Project Antifreeze to regularly provide tea to Brighton's
	homeless people – the same delicious organic tea that we serve our
	customers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	collecting
	and donating to local organisations so they can keep doing their
	fantastic work – providing things like food, accommodation,
	clothing and various support services for homeless people in
	Brighton</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To
make any of this happen though, we'll need a viable business model.
The first step for that is funding – and that's where you come
in...</p>

<p>The

<li>
<p>

</li>
<li>
<p>
	Pay
	the wages for at least two part-time employees through the first

<p>Simply put, exceeding our goal means we can do more. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>

<li>
<p>
	It

<p>
The
city of Brighton &amp; Hove has the highest proportional population
of homeless people across the whole south coast of England and it's
only growing – the number has doubled in the last five years alone.
Furthermore, Brighton and Hove Independent recently reported that
long-term rough sleepers are 35 times more likely to commit suicide
than the general population.</p>
<p>
When
I moved to Brighton in August 2015, I was shocked by the number of
people I saw living on the streets - I'd been planning to start up my
own business in any case, and after these people told me the stories
of how they'd ended up homeless and the lack of support many of them
were receiving in one of the wealthiest cities and countries in the
world, I felt like I had to do something to help them.</p>
<p>
I
spent a lot of time speaking to relevant people including rough
sleepers themselves and the charities and organisations that work day
in, day out to help them, discussing my ideas with friends and
considering how I could either support the great work already being
done or make a contribution of my own.</p>
<p>
I
found that the homelessness problem is a complex one. It involves
many factors, including social and mental health issues, depression,
drug and alcohol abuse and negative perceptions and assumptions from
the public.</p>
<p>
Many
of the people I spoke to had become homeless because of a
relationship breakdown or a job loss - it hit me that this kind of
thing could happen to any of us, at any time. Not only that, but once
homeless, it's extremely hard to find the motivation and support to
get back out of the situation, and applying for a job is hard without
a home address and a place to maintain personal hygiene.</p>
<p>
Add
in the depression and illness that arises from spending so much time
out on the streets, and taunts of “get a job!” (or worse) from
certain members of the public, and it truly is an unimaginable life.</p>
<p>
It's
a tough situation, and for many, like Jamie (pictured here with my
dog Miguel) it's impossible to see a way out.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447343633/fa0kanflc7mkhbi7vuvo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I
realised that with all the problems associated with homelessness, I
would be out of my depth trying to organise an initiative to house
them, and even if I did, there are so many issues that have to be
tackled simultaneously in order to ensure that such a project would
remain a success beyond the simple provision of accommodation. So
instead, I decided to look into how my original business idea, The
Living Room, could offer some hope to people in this most desperate
of situations.</p>
<br/>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447343671/lazucijt4ncefepwg00a.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<p>
I've
never done anything like this before, so I'm breaking new ground by
entering into this industry. What I do have however, is bags of
passion, determination and a good business brain. In fact, I taught
business and marketing for a total of 6 years and worked in marketing
for another 5 after that.</p>
<p>
We're
not naive here in The Living Room team, and we know that it's not enough just to want to help.
Having a viable business that's attractive to our target customers is
our top priority - only then will we be able to realise our goal of
supporting the people who need it in our local community.</p>
<p>
We
have a network of dedicated and well-informed friends and advisers,
who are more than willing to invest their time and energy to help us
and contribute their expertise in areas like business management,
hospitality and catering, finance, commercial real estate, SEO,
homelessness issues and more. We're open and willing to listen to,
and act upon, what these people have to say, and we're not afraid to
change course on some issues if we're convinced it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p>
We're
meeting new people every day who, because of the nature of this
venture, want to lend their support in the form of time and effort,
knowledgeable advice and other things of value that they or their
organisations can contribute. The support and positivity for The
Living Room has been overwhelming, and we're grateful to everyone who
has given something of themselves so far.</p>
<p>
As
far as the project itself is concerned, the only risk is that we
don't reach our goal – if we do, The Living Room will happen, and
if we don't, it won't. It's as simple as that. So the only thing
you'll be losing if we don't reach our goal is the opportunity to
enjoy the incredible experience we're planning to create for you.</p>
<p>
And
that pretty much brings you up to speed on where we are right now -
where we go from here is down to you.</p>

Hi.
I'm Sam. My team and I are seeking funding for a community-led Tea & Juice Bar and called The Living Room, which will launch in Brighton, England, in
early 2016.The
Living Room will provide a little bit of everything; as well as being
a cosy place where you can pop in any time for a cup of delicious
tea, a freshly-pressed juice or a nice hot bowl of soup, we'll be
hosting a bunch of events right from yoga and meditation to artistic
performances and exhibitions, as well as youth clubs, book clubs,
board game evenings and presentations on all kinds of interesting
topics – patrons will be encouraged to put their own events on too.
The focus will always be on coming together to promote wellbeing and
good times.

This
is your chance to make The Living Room a reality.

You
can help by investing any amount of money to make The Living Room
happen, or by sharing this campaign using the hashtag #makeTLRhappen or following us at www.facebook.com/TheLivingRoomBrighton.This is a fixed funding project, so you'll get your contribution back if we don't reach our target. If you have any questions, please get in touch here.



The
Living Room is all about community – our aim is to create our own
community of like-minded people, while serving our own local
community in any way we can.


Other
words that are important for us are care, kindness, friendship and
fun; The Living Room will be a supportive environment where anyone
can come to find themselves, get support and have a good time.


We'll
also be working alongside local charities and organisations to help
them in their daily work of tackling homelessness head on.
If this sounds like the kind of place you'd like to spend your time, please contribute to this campaign and make it happen!




Just
about everything's in place - the business plan is ready to put into
action and the financial calculations are done to the penny - but
getting a business like this up and running doesn't come for free,
with rent, wages, furniture, and loads of other little things to pay
for.

We'll
be extremely grateful for any amount you can invest - big or small,
it'll help bring this concept to the world and make a lasting
positive impact on our community.
For example, everyone who invests just £2 will be giving an organic cup of tea to a homeless person, as well as getting their name on a ""thank you"" poster that will be framed at The Living Room when we open. And it doesn't stop there - once we reach our target and get up and running, we'll give a cup of tea a home for every one we sell.
You can find out more about this in our video interview with Sara Emerson from Project Antifreeze (http://www.offthefence.org.uk/antifreeze/)





Since
coming to live in Brighton after nine years living abroad, I've been
touched by the situation of numerous people I've seen and spoken to
living rough on the streets.

I
decided to offer my help through The Living Room, a business I've
been working on and planning for some time – and now I'm assembling
a team of superheroes to finally make it happen.

We
know we can't solve the homelessness problem alone, but we believe
that by cooperating with local organisations who are already doing
great work, The Living Room can make a significant difference. We
have a number of arrangements already in place with such
organisations – some of these include:



	working
	with Business Action On Homelessness to offer training and
	employment opportunities to homeless people



	buying
	our soups from Dine, a kitchen service that provides homeless
	people with training for catering careers and feeds its profits into
	the First Base Day Centre



	working
	with various organisations to distribute any unsold food to people
	who need it

	homeless people – the same delicious organic tea that we serve our
	customers



	collecting
	and donating to local organisations so they can keep doing their
	fantastic work – providing things like food, accommodation,
	clothing and various support services for homeless people in
	Brighton



To
make any of this happen though, we'll need a viable business model.
The first step for that is funding – and that's where you come
in...






The
Living Room will need funding of at least £55,000
to:



	Pay
	for the business start-up costs: this includes equipment, furniture,
	refurbishment and legal fees among others. This is expected to be
	£25,000



	Pay
	the wages for at least two part-time employees through the first
	year of trading: We expect sales to grow during the first year so we
	can afford to pay employees from the second year onwards, but until
	then we'll need some help. This is expected to cost around £19,000



	Cover
	Indiegogo's fee of 5% (£2,500) and transaction fees of 3% or more
	(£1,500+)



	Pay
	for perks, including our employees' time required to provide them
	(£7,000). All perks include giving homeless people in Brighton tea
	through Project Antifreeze (at least one cup will be given out
	for every £2 raised - that's a minimum of 27,500 cups of tea if we reach  our funding goal!)





Below is a summary of some of the things we're offering to our investors. To find out exactly what you can get and how much to invest to get it, see our perks on the right hand side of this page. Note that the pictures below are just for illustration, and the actual designs may vary from these.

We can also offer a range of corporate packages for larger investments, so please get in touch to discuss this option further.



Simply put, exceeding our goal means we can do more. For example:



	The
	more capital we raise, the more chance The Living Room has of
	survival, and the more good we can do in the local community as time
	goes by – for example, each £10,000
	of additional capital we raise will keep The Living Room running for
	another month, giving us more time to reach our sales targets with
	less pressure



	It
	will also mean that we'll be covered if we need to pay a higher rent
	than expected for our premises, or if we end up needing more staff
	than anticipated - in turn, this will create more jobs in the local
	area



	Each
	£2
	raised
	equals a cup of delicious organic tea for a homeless person, no
	matter how much we raise - so for example, if we reach double our
	goal then at least 55,000
	cuppas will be given out

<br/>It’s an opportunity we can grasp together</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We watch commercials every day, everywhere. Online advertisements, social media, commercials on television or YouTube, posters, shirts and guess what, they are even on your pen! Businesses from all over the world are incredibly eager to have you get to know their company and message. Research points out that within the first six months of 2014,<b> internet advertisement</b> revenues hit the <b>23 billion dollar mark</b>, and this is just online, only measured in the USA. That’s more than some countries make in a year! That means that huge amounts of money are spent just on product promotions. So we asked ourselves a question: <b>what can we do to employ such revenues for a better cause?</b></p><h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/>Charities, foundation, NGO’s and NPO’s</span></h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lots of people want to <b>make the world a better place</b>. And businesses wish to contribute to the community. Foundations are being set up to serve good causes. We have spoken with NGO’s (non-governmental environmental organisations), but also with smaller foundations. They all work committedly on projects that contribute to the well being of our planet. <b>We want to contribute to our planet as well by supporting meaningful projects.</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1392884/files/20150417144727-Personalstats-01.jpg?1429307247"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<h3>Plenty brings fun into watching commercials.</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is where the idea of Plenty kicked in. Plenty is going to be an app for iOS and Android platforms, enabling you to <b>support a charity for free; simply by watching commercials</b>. To make it even more interesting, we also thought of ways to make commercials fun, by adding a gaming element. <br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">By transforming a commercial into a <b>fun micro-game</b> we allow users to enjoy themselves and keep a commercial interesting. Even better, with this gaming element, Plenty is the first advertising platform that can guarantee its advertisers that <b>viewers immerse themselves</b> within their brand experience. Plenty wants to connect conscious brands with conscious people and support the good cause, that’s a triple win!</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>We truly believe that we can <b>use commercials for the good</b>, as long as we all do it together. And for us to make this happen, we need your help!</p>
<br/><h3>How it works</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1392091/files/20150417100924-Gaming2-01.jpg?1429290564"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The idea of Plenty is simple: by watching commercials together, and having more fun while watching them, we can <b>raise money and use it for charities</b>. You can use Plenty when you are in the bus to school, in the train to work, while relaxing in bed or in any other situation you feel comfortable with (that includes your restroom). So with very little effort and no money involved you can support a charity every moment of the day, as many times you’d like!<br/><h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Main screen</h4>Once you open Plenty you get to see the main screen from where you can either watch a commercial, choose another project, or check your stats and read more about the charity you want to support.<h4></h4>

Except that this makes the activity more fun, it also helps us to make sure that commercials are being watched until the end. Sounds interesting for businesses who want you to see their commercials right? These <b>organisations are going to pay money to the charity of your choice, for every commercial watched!</b><br/><br/>We believe that <b>gamified commercials</b> can be enjoyable for app users, and at the same time interesting for those businesses which are trying to reach people with their hearts in the right place. We think that this hand in hand approach is essential to make a good sustainable application and a good way to really make a change.<br/><br/><h3>The team</h3>The team consists of three enthusiastic guys graduated from the Industrial Design department at the Eindhoven University of Technology, with a Master of Science degree, each one specialised in a different direction.

<br/>A Foundation</h3>Our vision is to start a foundation as a<b> legal non-profit organisation</b>. This foundation will function as the organizational backbone of the app Plenty from which we can get in contact with businesses to arrange contracts for commercials.  <br/><br/>We will work on a <b>transparent</b> foundation: information regarding revenues, costs and cash flows will all be visible on our website.

That is why we think a foundation with full transparency behind the app Plenty is the way to go.<br/><br/><h4>Our goal</h4>The Plenty Foundation is non-profit. But to bring this app into reality, we do need sponsors. Here is an overview of what we would do with your contributions:<br/><br/><b>€ 25.000</b>: With 25.000 we can make a simple version of Plenty. App users are not able to select other projects. Instead we choose the projects that will be supported. There won't be personal and global stats available. Of course you can still expect fun little games while watching a commercial. With the 25.000 we can hire programmers to make the app, built a database, rent servers, streaming video's, link data of user's to projects and so on.<br/><b>€ 50.000</b>: With 50.000 we can include the option for you to choose the projects you want to support. On top of that we will add more games and more commercials.<br/><b>€ 100.000</b>: With 100.000 we can make the application as we’ve envisioned. This includes more projects, commercials, games and personal and global stats, so you can really see your impact.<br/><br/><h3>You can help us!</h3>

</div></div>","Support meaningful projects by watching a commercial with Plenty!There are many great projects going on in the world in which people help each other out or help to protect nature and wildlife. Traditionally you can support them by memberships, with monthly payments. With Plenty however you can support charity projects for free! How? With Plenty you can discover and support charities from all over the world, just by watching a commercial. Do you also feel it is time to use commercials for the good? Help us to make the non-profit and social app Plenty a reality by making a contribution on Indiegogo!
It’s an opportunity we can grasp togetherWe watch commercials every day, everywhere. Online advertisements, social media, commercials on television or YouTube, posters, shirts and guess what, they are even on your pen! Businesses from all over the world are incredibly eager to have you get to know their company and message. Research points out that within the first six months of 2014, internet advertisement revenues hit the 23 billion dollar mark, and this is just online, only measured in the USA. That’s more than some countries make in a year! That means that huge amounts of money are spent just on product promotions. So we asked ourselves a question: what can we do to employ such revenues for a better cause?Charities, foundation, NGO’s and NPO’sLots of people want to make the world a better place. And businesses wish to contribute to the community. Foundations are being set up to serve good causes. We have spoken with NGO’s (non-governmental environmental organisations), but also with smaller foundations. They all work committedly on projects that contribute to the well being of our planet. We want to contribute to our planet as well by supporting meaningful projects.
Plenty brings fun into watching commercials.
This is where the idea of Plenty kicked in. Plenty is going to be an app for iOS and Android platforms, enabling you to support a charity for free; simply by watching commercials. To make it even more interesting, we also thought of ways to make commercials fun, by adding a gaming element. 
By transforming a commercial into a fun micro-game we allow users to enjoy themselves and keep a commercial interesting. Even better, with this gaming element, Plenty is the first advertising platform that can guarantee its advertisers that viewers immerse themselves within their brand experience. Plenty wants to connect conscious brands with conscious people and support the good cause, that’s a triple win!
We truly believe that we can use commercials for the good, as long as we all do it together. And for us to make this happen, we need your help!
How it works
The idea of Plenty is simple: by watching commercials together, and having more fun while watching them, we can raise money and use it for charities. You can use Plenty when you are in the bus to school, in the train to work, while relaxing in bed or in any other situation you feel comfortable with (that includes your restroom). So with very little effort and no money involved you can support a charity every moment of the day, as many times you’d like!
Main screenOnce you open Plenty you get to see the main screen from where you can either watch a commercial, choose another project, or check your stats and read more about the charity you want to support.


Commercial with game layer
When you watch a commercial you will also get to play a minigame. Except that this makes the activity more fun, it also helps us to make sure that commercials are being watched until the end. Sounds interesting for businesses who want you to see their commercials right? These organisations are going to pay money to the charity of your choice, for every commercial watched!We believe that gamified commercials can be enjoyable for app users, and at the same time interesting for those businesses which are trying to reach people with their hearts in the right place. We think that this hand in hand approach is essential to make a good sustainable application and a good way to really make a change.The teamThe team consists of three enthusiastic guys graduated from the Industrial Design department at the Eindhoven University of Technology, with a Master of Science degree, each one specialised in a different direction. Different interests but similar backgrounds makes our team strong and dynamic. All of us are multi-disciplinary trained and therefore we are comfortable working on different stages within the design process.

Decto NUC was created to locate such dangerous materials. It is important to prevent the exposure of dangerous radioactive materials and to protect us from radioactive sickness! Article about the findings: http://news.err.ee/v/politics/environment/4a1b5112-b31d-48e2-94ca-07b5fd4d2764/iss-finds-radioactive-substance-container-near-tallinnPRODUCT FEATURESHow do Decto products work?1.  Firstly, download the Decto Free or Decto Premium software to your smart device.2.  Open the app.3.  Connect your personal DECTO device directly, using a micro USB (OTG supported), or via Bluetooth with Decto BT MATE.4.  The product is ready to take measurements. If necessary, please, read the manual, which is under the sign “?”.Why should I use Decto products?Decto products are designed to help to improve the quality of your life. The products are your personal smart detectors and sensors.There are sensors and detectors already available. Why should I use yours?Decto sensors and detectors are smart and small, light weighted, environmentally friendly, available at an affordable price and supported with an educating software.Do you like to travel around? Getting a new home in another area? Decto products are for you then! Measure the air temperature, air pressure, humidity, the intensity of light/luminance and radiation with the Decto devices wherever you go.How portable are the sensors? How much do they weigh?Decto sensors weigh about 0.5-1.4 ounces (10-15 grams), you can easily keep it in your pocket or handbag.Do I need to download the app to use a Decto sensor/detector?Yes, hardware needs software in order to work, even a printer. You can download a Free or Premium Decto app from Google Play or App Store. Drivers for Windows, Mac and Linux will soon be available.Will Decto sensors work with any smart device?Sensors/detectors are compatible with iOS 9.0+ devices and Android 4.3+ devices with Bluetooth and OTG (on-the-go) support. Is the Decto mobile app available free of charge?There is a Decto Free and Decto Premium version. Decto Free version provides you with the measurement results, time and date, easy sharing and location (coordinates), notification function, the usage of one sensor at a time. Decto Premium provides you some handy extras: map view, usage of multiple sensors simultaneously and camera function. If there is a necessity for those features, then consider downloading a Premium version (one-time fee) and use it in all account linked smart devices.Will I receive any alerts?Yes, you can set minimum and maximum values in your app and get immediate notification, when the measured results are out of the previously defined level. All the notifications can be customized in the settings section.There’s a blue LED light in all Decto products. Why?Blue LED light is an indicator, which shows that the sensor/detector is connected to your smart device and that your smart device supports OTG (on-to-go). If the LED does not light up (or if you are using an iPhone, a tablet or a PC), then we recommend to use Decto BT MATE to connect via bluetooth.  TECHNICAL QUESTIONSHow trustworthy are the measured values?All sensors/detectors are pre-calibrated by the sensor/detector manufacturer and go through calibration procedure on our production line to increase its accuracy. Our partner in the field of calibration is Metrosert Ltd. They perform the calibration and verification of measuring instruments, certification of products and management systems in Estonia.How long will the battery last?Smart sensors and detectors do not have a battery. They work while being attached to you smart phone and use its battery. BT MATE has a 380mhA Li-ion battery and it lasts differently for each sensor. For example, Decto NUC consumes a lot of energy, so it takes 36 hours from being fully charged to empty.  Are the sensors/detectors waterproof?No, they are not. What is the operating temperature?Recommended operating temperature for Decto sensors/detectors is from -40°C to +85°C. There is a limitation due to the processor recommended conditions.Can the measured sensor/detector data be saved and shared?Yes, your data, as well as location via GPS, can be saved to our secure cloud and/or shared publicly. Decto application also works as a ""big data"" map and everyone can make a contribution by sharing air pollution, radiation, temperature etc related measurements on a map. Sharing, of course, is not compulsory and can be edited from the settings.DISTRIBUTIONWhat happens to the money you raise?Your money will be used to invest in mass-production: tooling, manufacturing setup and component parts.When will the NUC and mates ship?According to the plan, in May 2016.Where will you ship?We ship worldwide!Do they come with a warranty?Yes! We offer a 12 month manufacturers’ warranty with all our products.I am a distributor.

<h3 style=""color: rgb(34, 22, 135);"">Gameplay. Where do resides the fun and challenge? The defiance of learn</h3> <p>  Shouhin Bonsai dare you to deal with the continuos growth of up to 3 bonsais. You will have to take care of them in this specific aspects: solar energy absorved, hydration, substrate mineralization, substrate distribution, pruning, defensive fertilization and combative fertilization.</p>
<p> Time in game is a bit accelerated compared to our time, therefore you will experiment a bit quickler growing of bonsai items(leaves, branchs, trunk, flowers, fruits) than the ones in real life. This was subtly adapted to not experience boredom. Since this is a simulation as closer that it can to the real world, I don't want to accelerate the in-game time more than it is now.</p>
<p> To experiment quickler the behaviour of the bonsais versus the year seassons, SB implements 3 weeks for a seasson, so a year in-game are 3 months of our-daily life.</p>
<p> The user will have to take a look into the game daily, at least once, to keep their plants healthy. I never thought to make the player a slave of the game, I always thought about everyone, since the one who checks his smartphones once daily, while traveling back from their jobs, to people which have more time to be connected. There will be an option for those who want to take vacations of the technology: enabling an specific in-game action you'll freeze your progress. Then when you want to come back to play again you revert the action, with no loss(and not growth of course) at all.</p>
<p> Internet free. Although Google Game Service will be integrated to SB(so requires login to their server), I'm aimed to make the gamer free to play in everywhere, without need of internet connection.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3 style=""color: rgb(34, 22, 135);"">Three kind of bonsais, three bonsai kinds</h3> <p> Cypress, the bonsai of bonsais is a must. Cypress is a shouhaku bonsai, which means a conifer one. I also wanted to include another variety of trees, that's why we will have a Maple, representing zakki bonsais, broadleaf one; and a Jasmine, representing hanamono bonsais, floral.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3 style=""color: rgb(34, 22, 135);"">Some words about the abstraction. A closer look</h3>
<div> To write the simulation of a real world thing one must study it, deeply. Then one have to define a level of abstraction for the simulation, how deeply you want to show the rabbit hole, this is necessary to not fall into madness.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> The deepness reached contents me, it goes pretty far.</span>
</div>
<div>
<h4 style=""color: rgb(22, 107, 135);"">Sickness</h4>
<p> Each bonsai element(branches, leaves, male flowers, female flowers, fruits) can get sick. There are currently eight simulated diseases. The progress of a bonsai is linked to its health.</p>
<h4 style=""color: rgb(22, 107, 135);"">Natural interpretation of bonsai growing</h4>
<p> The bonsai growth has randomness and control. Example: will never exist fruits if first there aren't male and female flowers.</p>
<h4 style=""color: rgb(22, 107, 135);"">Mineralization reduced over time</h4>
<p> It is known that one of the components of the photosynthesis factory are the minerals within the substrate. Over time these minerals get depleted due to the consumption made by the plant. At some point, photosynthesis production is relatively low due to the above, good moment to change the substrate, but note...  it's good if it's spring, while in another seasson bonsai can be damaged.</p>
<h4 style=""color: rgb(22, 107, 135);"">Irrigation power</h4>
<p> Be cautious with the irrigation with full watering can! The power with which the water comes out of the watering can, can mess up the distribution of the substrate and cause stress on the plant, resulting in a reduction in the production of photosynthesis. Watering should be at low pressure and well distributed.</p>
<h4 style=""color: rgb(22, 107, 135);""> UV radiation</h4>
<p> Shouhin Bonsai also simulates the variation in solar UV radiation. There are days that's more severe than others, that determines how much you could expose the bonsai in the sun without causing burns. Also note that different seassons means different solar energy power, and of course, due to this, plant dehydrated quickler in the summer than in the winter.</p>
<h4 style=""color: rgb(22, 107, 135);""> Preventive fertilization</h4>
<p> Exist artificial and organic preventive fertilizers provisions, the latter being more efficient but more complicated to get! Everything has a cost(gold) in the game and you must learn to manage it. The only way to get gold is completing achievements or participating in the annual local and international exhibitions.</p>
<h4 style=""color: rgb(22, 107, 135);""> Annual exhibitions</h4>
<p> Like all bonsai lover knows, there are bonsai exhibitions, and bonsai beauty and care contests around the world. Shouhin Bonsai is no exception. It has two annual(in-game) exhibitions, one local and one international. At the end of the exhibition, the user gets a place in the competition, which equals a certain amount of gold.

<p> Basically the defensive fertilization is about to have in-game gold to get artificial fertilizers or raw materials to construct organic fertilizers. As you know if you read, the gold is obtained in the annuals exhibitions, where you'll get a ranking position based in the health of your bonsai, beauty and amount of bonsai items(fruits gives more points, balance between male and female flowers give some anothers, and also the leaves). <b>Artificial fertilizers</b> are not so good as the organic ones, they cover few defense, are cheaper and works for a large amount of days. On the other hand <b>organic fertilizers</b> expires in a week, they cover more defense(up to 75%) and constructing them is expensive.

<p> Another items are being created, which will influence the defense againts plagues. They can be coupled with any of your bonsais, one item for one bonsai. This items can be obtained completing achievements. I'll give some randomness in the obtaining of these objects, so we can enjoy variety and fun. Some of them will only help you for a specific kind of plague, i.e.: [+20% protection againts Small Mealybugs].

</div></div>","Brief Description  Simulation videogame of bonsais growth and care Everyone with Android in their smartphone or tablet can play it Will be free to download in Google Play Store and without advertisings
Internationalization. 8 languages on focus: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Italian and French
Highly educational and funny
Google Game Services integration. There will be score(oxygen) rankings,  achievements system, savegames on the cloud and more
Not necessary to be connected to internet to play


 Note: go straight to the gallery to see high quality original screenshots of the game, the ones here are reduced in size for aesthetic purpose.


  


Gameplay. Where do resides the fun and challenge? The defiance of learn   Shouhin Bonsai dare you to deal with the continuos growth of up to 3 bonsais. You will have to take care of them in this specific aspects: solar energy absorved, hydration, substrate mineralization, substrate distribution, pruning, defensive fertilization and combative fertilization.
 Time in game is a bit accelerated compared to our time, therefore you will experiment a bit quickler growing of bonsai items(leaves, branchs, trunk, flowers, fruits) than the ones in real life. This was subtly adapted to not experience boredom. Since this is a simulation as closer that it can to the real world, I don't want to accelerate the in-game time more than it is now.
 To experiment quickler the behaviour of the bonsais versus the year seassons, SB implements 3 weeks for a seasson, so a year in-game are 3 months of our-daily life.
 The user will have to take a look into the game daily, at least once, to keep their plants healthy. I never thought to make the player a slave of the game, I always thought about everyone, since the one who checks his smartphones once daily, while traveling back from their jobs, to people which have more time to be connected. There will be an option for those who want to take vacations of the technology: enabling an specific in-game action you'll freeze your progress. Then when you want to come back to play again you revert the action, with no loss(and not growth of course) at all.
 Internet free. Although Google Game Service will be integrated to SB(so requires login to their server), I'm aimed to make the gamer free to play in everywhere, without need of internet connection.

  
    Three kind of bonsais, three bonsai kinds  Cypress, the bonsai of bonsais is a must. Cypress is a shouhaku bonsai, which means a conifer one. I also wanted to include another variety of trees, that's why we will have a Maple, representing zakki bonsais, broadleaf one; and a Jasmine, representing hanamono bonsais, floral.
    Some words about the abstraction. A closer look
 To write the simulation of a real world thing one must study it, deeply. Then one have to define a level of abstraction for the simulation, how deeply you want to show the rabbit hole, this is necessary to not fall into madness. The deepness reached contents me, it goes pretty far.


Sickness
 Each bonsai element(branches, leaves, male flowers, female flowers, fruits) can get sick. There are currently eight simulated diseases. The progress of a bonsai is linked to its health.
Natural interpretation of bonsai growing
 The bonsai growth has randomness and control. Example: will never exist fruits if first there aren't male and female flowers.
Mineralization reduced over time
 It is known that one of the components of the photosynthesis factory are the minerals within the substrate. Over time these minerals get depleted due to the consumption made by the plant. At some point, photosynthesis production is relatively low due to the above, good moment to change the substrate, but note...  it's good if it's spring, while in another seasson bonsai can be damaged.
Irrigation power
 Be cautious with the irrigation with full watering can! The power with which the water comes out of the watering can, can mess up the distribution of the substrate and cause stress on the plant, resulting in a reduction in the production of photosynthesis. Watering should be at low pressure and well distributed.
 UV radiation
 Shouhin Bonsai also simulates the variation in solar UV radiation. There are days that's more severe than others, that determines how much you could expose the bonsai in the sun without causing burns. Also note that different seassons means different solar energy power, and of course, due to this, plant dehydrated quickler in the summer than in the winter.
 Preventive fertilization
 Exist artificial and organic preventive fertilizers provisions, the latter being more efficient but more complicated to get! Everything has a cost(gold) in the game and you must learn to manage it. The only way to get gold is completing achievements or participating in the annual local and international exhibitions.
 Annual exhibitions
 Like all bonsai lover knows, there are bonsai exhibitions, and bonsai beauty and care contests around the world. Shouhin Bonsai is no exception. It has two annual(in-game) exhibitions, one local and one international. At the end of the exhibition, the user gets a place in the competition, which equals a certain amount of gold. That gold will serve to maintain your bonsais healthy and therefore allow a faster growth.

 Want to know more about the game? Reference to the Updates side of the website, there you'll find some more videos, screenshots and more. This is the last updates:


How does it feels the interaction with the screen?

 You can see the big picture of your bonsai and each items closely. By doing that you will be able to detect a sick component. If you're skilled in detecting when the plants in your garden are sick you'll do the same here. Each item varies its colors proving that is sick, if it doesn't receive at least some sunlight will head discoloration. Not only its color varies, also in size and form, since they can wilt. By zooming in, you can also detect if a branch is bleeding sap due to a pruning, sometimes will get damaged.

A bit of the defensive fertilization side of the application

 Basically the defensive fertilization is about to have in-game gold to get artificial fertilizers or raw materials to construct organic fertilizers. As you know if you read, the gold is obtained in the annuals exhibitions, where you'll get a ranking position based in the health of your bonsai, beauty and amount of bonsai items(fruits gives more points, balance between male and female flowers give some anothers, and also the leaves). Artificial fertilizers are not so good as the organic ones, they cover few defense, are cheaper and works for a large amount of days.

      Freizeitpark
      für behinderte und nicht behinderte Kinder umbauen. Unser
      erstes Ziel
      ist es, behinderten Menschen - seien es die Eltern oder die
      Kinder - eine
      gemeinsame Freizeitgestaltung zur ermöglichen . Der ganze Park
      soll mit
      Spielgeräten ausgestattet werden, die von beiden Gruppen gemeinsam
      genutzt
      werden können, damit von vorn herein keine Trennung entsteht.  Wer betroffen ist, weiß genau
      wie schwierig
      die Freizeitgestaltung ist, wenn für jeden etwas dabei sein soll.
      </p>
<p>Unser zweites Ziel ist es, diesen Park auch
      sozial schwachen
      Familien zu ermöglichen. Der Eintrittspreis soll zwei bis drei EUR
      nach
      Möglichkeit nicht übersteigen.  Jeder
      von
      uns kennt die großen Freizeitparks, die hohe Eintrittsgelder
      verlangen und das
      Mitbringen von Speisen und Getränken verbieten. Damit ist es meist
      aber noch
      nicht getan. Im Park selber gibt es haufenweise kleinere Aktionen,
      die wieder
      extra kosten. Damit wird ein Tagesausflug für kinderreiche Familien und Durchschnitts-Verdiener fast unbezahlbar. </p>
<p>Unser All-In-Park wird außer Gastronomie keine
      versteckten
      Kosten haben. Ob es Kinderschminken, Ballontiere basteln, Gold
      schürfen oder
      ähnliche kleine Aktionen sind: Alles ist inbegriffen. Und wer
      seine Speisen und
      Getränke selber mitbringen möchte, kann ein gemütliches Picknick
      auf unserem
      Gelände machen. </p>
<p>Um die Kosten für den Park so niedrig wie
      möglich zu halten,
      sollen alle Geräte ohne Strom betrieben werden.  Unter Anderem möchten wir auch
      eine
      Pferdelaufbahn für mechanische Pferden bauen. Diese Pferde gibt es
      in
      verschiedenen Größen. Sie können sowohl von Kindern als auch von
      Erwachsenen
      bedient werden. Damit auch hier Rollstuhlfahrer nicht
      ausgeschlossen werden,
      möchten wir eine Konstruktion bauen, die es ermöglicht den
      Rollstuhl zur
      Kutsche umzufunktionieren. So können alle gemeinsam einen Ausritt
      starten. </p>
<p>Wenn wir eine Finanzierung über Banken
      anstreben würden,
      könnten wir die Eintrittspreise nicht halten. Damit wäre es nicht
      unser Ziel und
      somit auch nicht unser Park.</p>
<p>Wenn man bedenkt, dass einzelne Firmen mehrere
      Millionen in
      ein Fussballstadion stecken, nur damit es deren Namen trägt,
      sollte es doch
      auch möglich sein, diese Summe für einen sozialen Zweck zu sammeln.
      Wenn es nur
      um Werbung geht: Toben Sie sich aus. Wir haben ausreichend Platz.
      </p>
<p>Unser größter Traum wäre es, wenn weltweit
      begeisterte Fans
      nachziehen und ebenfalls einen All-In-Park eröffnen.</p><p>Das Team:</p><p></p>

<p></p><p><a name=""english"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Hello, my
name is Christine Mai. Me and my team would like to turn this piece of land (50 acres lot) into an adventure park for disabled and able-bodied children. Our
first goal is to serve disabled people – whether parent or child – so that they
can enjoy leisurely time together with their families. The entire park is to be
filled with toys and games that can be used by both groups, so that a
separation will not follow. Affected parties know how difficult it can be to
find fun entertainment and activities that are all-inclusive.</p>
<p>Our
second goal is to make this park affordable for financially challenged families.
We envision an admission fee between 2 and 3 euros. All of us are familiar with
huge, popular theme parks that charge pricey admission fees and require of
their patrons to purchase food and beverages, should the patron get hungry or
thirsty.  Within the park costs often add
up to even more as many smaller activities are not included in the admission
fee. Considering the combined cost, it is becoming nearly impossible for
middleclass families, especially larger ones, to afford a visit.</p>
<p>Our
All-in-park will have no hidden costs, whether balloon animals, face
painting or digging for gold. The purchase of refreshments will be an option
while at the same time a picnic area will be provided. To keep costs down, we
are envisioning a park in which no activities require electricity. If at all
possible, we would like to build a racetrack for mechanical horses. These
mechanical horses exist in all sizes already and can be used by adults and
children as well. To include wheelchair bound attendees, we are hoping to construct
an attachment that could convert a wheelchair into a functioning carriage. This
way a whole family could start a ride together. </p>
<p>To
have our park financed by banks would mean that we would have to charge much
higher admission fees than we would like, and that is not our goal. </p>
<p>When
considering how much large corporations are willing to spend on naming a sports
arena,  one would hope that a smaller
amount could be collected so that financially disadvantaged families can enjoy
a fun filled day. </p>
<p>Our
dream is to inspire others and see similar parks popping up all over the world.</p><p></p><p>The Team:</p>

      ist es, behinderten Menschen - seien es die Eltern oder die
      Kinder - eine
      gemeinsame Freizeitgestaltung zur ermöglichen . Der ganze Park
      soll mit
      Spielgeräten ausgestattet werden, die von beiden Gruppen gemeinsam
      genutzt
      werden können, damit von vorn herein keine Trennung entsteht.  Wer betroffen ist, weiß genau
      wie schwierig
      die Freizeitgestaltung ist, wenn für jeden etwas dabei sein soll.
      
Unser zweites Ziel ist es, diesen Park auch
      sozial schwachen
      Familien zu ermöglichen. Der Eintrittspreis soll zwei bis drei EUR
      nach
      Möglichkeit nicht übersteigen.  Jeder
      von
      uns kennt die großen Freizeitparks, die hohe Eintrittsgelder
      verlangen und das
      Mitbringen von Speisen und Getränken verbieten. Damit ist es meist
      aber noch
      nicht getan. Im Park selber gibt es haufenweise kleinere Aktionen,
      die wieder
      extra kosten. Damit wird ein Tagesausflug für kinderreiche Familien und Durchschnitts-Verdiener fast unbezahlbar. 
Unser All-In-Park wird außer Gastronomie keine
      versteckten
      Kosten haben. Ob es Kinderschminken, Ballontiere basteln, Gold
      schürfen oder
      ähnliche kleine Aktionen sind: Alles ist inbegriffen. Und wer
      seine Speisen und
      Getränke selber mitbringen möchte, kann ein gemütliches Picknick
      auf unserem
      Gelände machen. 
Um die Kosten für den Park so niedrig wie
      möglich zu halten,
      sollen alle Geräte ohne Strom betrieben werden.  Unter Anderem möchten wir auch
      eine
      Pferdelaufbahn für mechanische Pferden bauen. Diese Pferde gibt es
      in
      verschiedenen Größen. Sie können sowohl von Kindern als auch von
      Erwachsenen
      bedient werden. Damit auch hier Rollstuhlfahrer nicht
      ausgeschlossen werden,
      möchten wir eine Konstruktion bauen, die es ermöglicht den
      Rollstuhl zur
      Kutsche umzufunktionieren. So können alle gemeinsam einen Ausritt
      starten. 
Wenn wir eine Finanzierung über Banken
      anstreben würden,
      könnten wir die Eintrittspreise nicht halten. Damit wäre es nicht
      unser Ziel und
      somit auch nicht unser Park.
Wenn man bedenkt, dass einzelne Firmen mehrere
      Millionen in
      ein Fussballstadion stecken, nur damit es deren Namen trägt,
      sollte es doch
      auch möglich sein, diese Summe für einen sozialen Zweck zu sammeln.
      Wenn es nur
      um Werbung geht: Toben Sie sich aus. Wir haben ausreichend Platz.
      
Unser größter Traum wäre es, wenn weltweit
      begeisterte Fans
      nachziehen und ebenfalls einen All-In-Park eröffnen.Das Team:

Hello, my
name is Christine Mai. Me and my team would like to turn this piece of land (50 acres lot) into an adventure park for disabled and able-bodied children. Our
first goal is to serve disabled people – whether parent or child – so that they
can enjoy leisurely time together with their families. The entire park is to be
filled with toys and games that can be used by both groups, so that a
separation will not follow. Affected parties know how difficult it can be to
find fun entertainment and activities that are all-inclusive.
Our
second goal is to make this park affordable for financially challenged families.
We envision an admission fee between 2 and 3 euros. All of us are familiar with
huge, popular theme parks that charge pricey admission fees and require of
their patrons to purchase food and beverages, should the patron get hungry or
thirsty.  Within the park costs often add
up to even more as many smaller activities are not included in the admission
fee. Considering the combined cost, it is becoming nearly impossible for
middleclass families, especially larger ones, to afford a visit.
Our
All-in-park will have no hidden costs, whether balloon animals, face
painting or digging for gold. The purchase of refreshments will be an option
while at the same time a picnic area will be provided. To keep costs down, we
are envisioning a park in which no activities require electricity. If at all
possible, we would like to build a racetrack for mechanical horses. These
mechanical horses exist in all sizes already and can be used by adults and
children as well. To include wheelchair bound attendees, we are hoping to construct
an attachment that could convert a wheelchair into a functioning carriage. This
way a whole family could start a ride together. 
To
have our park financed by banks would mean that we would have to charge much
higher admission fees than we would like, and that is not our goal. 
When
considering how much large corporations are willing to spend on naming a sports
arena,  one would hope that a smaller
amount could be collected so that financially disadvantaged families can enjoy
a fun filled day. 
Our
dream is to inspire others and see similar parks popping up all over the world.The Team:

<p>Hi there. My name is Igor. I’m an Environmentalist and Entrepreneur and that’s my Story.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I moved to Bali a year ago to run a Real Estate business. I was so excited and motivated. I had a few investors interested in my idea to build a condominium. Nevertheless, after 6 months of preparation and hard work my project  had to close up. While I was traveling around Bali in search for the best spot for the condo I found so many places that were stunning. However, on the other side, it was hard not to notice tons of trash scattered everywhere. What I saw that day made me think how the problem of littering in Bali can be solved and what exactly I can do for the matter. So with the help and support of my friends I started cleaning coastlines every week. Some time later I joined some other activists who also cleaned the beaches every weekend. But each time when I was collecting trash on the beach, I was telling myself that it will not resolve this problem. The trash will come back again and again. So next 6 month I spend creating a line of 100% plastic-free, reusable, biodegradable products meant to replace everyday use items at your home and businesses. Which has to subsequently reduce the use of plastic in the whole Bali. <strong>It’s time to say goodbye to plastic!</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>There was a time when plastic made so much sense - it was easy to use, inexpensive, and when you were done, you just threw it out. Sounds great right?</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Pagi Straws are compostable, so they won’t need to end up in a landfill.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What’s the most obvious difference between straws made of plastic and straws made of wheat stems? I think it’s pretty simple: the latter is natural, the former is not. Plastic, in its many forms, is made from petroleum—a nonrenewable resource that comes from fossil fuels. Wheat—a plant, of course—is a renewable resource that comes straight from Mother Earth, and she’s much more keen on taking it back when you’re done with it. Since Pagi Straws are purely wheat, they’ll biodegrade in the compost.</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/>Plastics like that are here to stay for a long, long time. And every single one that ends up in our oceans and landfills is a potential harm to wildlife, and the overall health of the planet.

<h2> </h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Bioplastics</strong> sound great in theory, but the reality is that they’re largely misunderstood, and in many cases don’t break down any faster than regular plastic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">There’s a lot of general confusion about what exactly are bioplastics, and what happens to them after you discard them. Because of misleading marketing, many consumers make the (often incorrect) assumption that bioplastics are always biodegradable. But the term “bioplastic” only refers to what it’s made from, not how it will break down after it’s thrown away.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Bioplastics are made from “biomass”—often pulp that’s leftover from processing other products, like sugarcane. While bioplastics may come from plant-based material, the molecular structure can prevent them from breaking down any differently from regular plastic. Many bioplastic materials are recyclable, but not compostable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/>Some kinds of bioplastics, called bio-polymers, do biodegrade, but only under very specific conditions—and not what’s created by your backyard compost bin. As a result, they must be composted in municipal facilities, and many areas don’t have them. If bioplastic products get rerouted to a recycling facility, there’s no technology to tell them apart from regular plastic, so they often get sent to the landfill anyway.   </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Paper straws</strong> are certainly a better choice than plastic, but wheat has a leg up in a few different ways: less processing, no sogginess, and bonus points for reducing air pollution!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Aren’t paper straws a more obvious choice for an alternative to plastic? Sure, if you like your straws nice and soggy. On the other hand, wheat stalks are designed by nature itself to support the plant and withstand the elements!  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <br/>Beyond the stability of the material, wheat has a few other advantages over paper straws. For instance, what’s one of the necessary evils of paper production? Deforestation. Mature forests must be destroyed to harvest wood for the pulp needed to make paper, and it’s all heavily processed before there’s a final product. Pagi Straws use wheat stems that are the byproduct of wheat production, so no additional plants must be grown or harvested in order to make our straws. In some countries like China, the stem byproduct is disposed of by burning, which contributes to air pollution. By creating a market for this unwanted byproduct, we’re eliminating the need to burn it, and helping to cut back on air pollution!</p>

<h2>More about products:</h2>
<p><strong>Vegan Reusable Food Wraps</strong> use plant-based Candelilla wax and non-GMO Soy wax. They also contain tree resin and jojoba oil and use natural cotton. This means they’re cruelty-free and completely vegan.</p>
<p>The combination of these ingredients results in the wax wrap being flexible, self-sticking, and unscented.</p>
<p>Candelilla wax is normally two-times denser than beeswax, so this may mean the vegan wrap is less pliable than the beeswax wrap. The vegan wrap also can’t be easily mended with additional melted wax, unlike beeswax wraps.</p>
<p>Soy wax is a renewable resource, so using it in this wrap means an environmentally-sustainable product.</p>
<p>The tree resin and jojoba oil also provide additional properties. The tree resin provides natural antibacterial properties, while jojoba oil is a natural fluid plant wax and is anti fungal.</p>

<p><strong>Cotton swabs</strong> are made from sustainably grown bamboo and cotton. They’re 100% biodegradable and come in a variety of colors - so you can add some flair to your bathroom. <br/><br/>The bamboo stem ensures they’re ultra lightweight and strong. <br/><br/>They’re designed to be more hygienically effective than your average plastic cotton swab.They're made with a thinner cotton tip which is recommended for a more effective clean. </p>
<p><br/>Bamboo’s eco-positive attributes continues to delight researchers…<br/><br/>Recent studies have indicated that many bamboo products are not only carbon neutral, but carbon negative! Bamboo produces 30% more oxygen than your regular run-of-the-mill tree.<br/><br/><strong>Why Plastic-Cotton-Swabs Were Designed By The Devil.</strong><br/><br/>Plastic-cotton-swabs are only used once and then trashed or flushed down the toilet. Which means they end up in landfill or worse - our rivers and oceans, where they will stay FOREVER!<br/><br/>What sucks even more about plastic-cotton-swabs is that they can not be recycled. These nasty mofos are made with the assistance of non-renewable oil in the manufacturing process. </p>

Hi there. My name is Igor. I’m an Environmentalist and Entrepreneur and that’s my Story.
 
I moved to Bali a year ago to run a Real Estate business. I was so excited and motivated. I had a few investors interested in my idea to build a condominium. Nevertheless, after 6 months of preparation and hard work my project  had to close up. While I was traveling around Bali in search for the best spot for the condo I found so many places that were stunning. However, on the other side, it was hard not to notice tons of trash scattered everywhere. What I saw that day made me think how the problem of littering in Bali can be solved and what exactly I can do for the matter. So with the help and support of my friends I started cleaning coastlines every week. Some time later I joined some other activists who also cleaned the beaches every weekend. But each time when I was collecting trash on the beach, I was telling myself that it will not resolve this problem. The trash will come back again and again. So next 6 month I spend creating a line of 100% plastic-free, reusable, biodegradable products meant to replace everyday use items at your home and businesses. Which has to subsequently reduce the use of plastic in the whole Bali. It’s time to say goodbye to plastic!
 
 

 
There was a time when plastic made so much sense - it was easy to use, inexpensive, and when you were done, you just threw it out. Sounds great right?
 


 
Well, jump ahead a couple of decades and I've learned it’s clogging our landfills, destroying our oceans, and impacting our health.
 

 
 
I'm opening an EXCLUSIVE LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP deal only on Indiegogo. 
By backing my campaign, you get special membership to our store FOR LIFE. With a membership, you’ll get up to 50% OFF our products plus first access to all our latest products. 
Also with Pagi Community Membership you will get special discounts in our partners when you will come to Bali.
 
My first goal is to replace all improper straw such as Plastic Straws, Paper Straws & Reusable Straw witch is not hygienic. 
 

 
 
The first step is establish local company and get all licences will cost 9220$.
After the company will be open I need to create a stock which will be able to provide enough straws for local restaurants and  that will cost 8000$ 
 
 

 
 
Why Switch to Pagi Straws?
 
With so many options out there for sustainable products, how do you know which ones are right for you? And how do they stack up against each other? I created this resource to outline the best reasons for using wheat straws, and how they’re different from paper straws.
 
 

 
Pagi Straws are compostable, so they won’t need to end up in a landfill.
What’s the most obvious difference between straws made of plastic and straws made of wheat stems? I think it’s pretty simple: the latter is natural, the former is not. Plastic, in its many forms, is made from petroleum—a nonrenewable resource that comes from fossil fuels. Wheat—a plant, of course—is a renewable resource that comes straight from Mother Earth, and she’s much more keen on taking it back when you’re done with it. Since Pagi Straws are purely wheat, they’ll biodegrade in the compost.
 

 
 
Straws that biodegrade cause less harm to the environment and wildlife.
 
If you spend any time on social media, I bet you’ve seen this viral video
 
         

 
 
 of an injured sea turtle posted a couple years ago (warning: it’s graphic!). Though fortunately the turtle survived, animal rescue workers pulled and tugged for several minutes to remove a foreign object from its nostril—a single-use plastic straw.  
Plastics like that are here to stay for a long, long time. And every single one that ends up in our oceans and landfills is a potential harm to wildlife, and the overall health of the planet. When you opt for biodegradable products, you’re reducing the number of harmful plastics that end up in fragile ecosystems worldwide.
 

 
 
Bioplastics sound great in theory, but the reality is that they’re largely misunderstood, and in many cases don’t break down any faster than regular plastic.
There’s a lot of general confusion about what exactly are bioplastics, and what happens to them after you discard them. Because of misleading marketing, many consumers make the (often incorrect) assumption that bioplastics are always biodegradable. But the term “bioplastic” only refers to what it’s made from, not how it will break down after it’s thrown away.
  
Bioplastics are made from “biomass”—often pulp that’s leftover from processing other products, like sugarcane. While bioplastics may come from plant-based material, the molecular structure can prevent them from breaking down any differently from regular plastic. Many bioplastic materials are recyclable, but not compostable.
Some kinds of bioplastics, called bio-polymers, do biodegrade, but only under very specific conditions—and not what’s created by your backyard compost bin. As a result, they must be composted in municipal facilities, and many areas don’t have them. If bioplastic products get rerouted to a recycling facility, there’s no technology to tell them apart from regular plastic, so they often get sent to the landfill anyway.   
 

 
Paper straws are certainly a better choice than plastic, but wheat has a leg up in a few different ways: less processing, no sogginess, and bonus points for reducing air pollution!
Aren’t paper straws a more obvious choice for an alternative to plastic? Sure, if you like your straws nice and soggy. On the other hand, wheat stalks are designed by nature itself to support the plant and withstand the elements!  
 Beyond the stability of the material, wheat has a few other advantages over paper straws. For instance, what’s one of the necessary evils of paper production? Deforestation. Mature forests must be destroyed to harvest wood for the pulp needed to make paper, and it’s all heavily processed before there’s a final product. Pagi Straws use wheat stems that are the byproduct of wheat production, so no additional plants must be grown or harvested in order to make our straws. In some countries like China, the stem byproduct is disposed of by burning, which contributes to air pollution. By creating a market for this unwanted byproduct, we’re eliminating the need to burn it, and helping to cut back on air pollution!
 
 
Next Step
 
Create an online store where I can put my line of 100% plastic-free, reusable, biodegradable products​. 
 

 
 
More about products:
Vegan Reusable Food Wraps use plant-based Candelilla wax and non-GMO Soy wax. They also contain tree resin and jojoba oil and use natural cotton. This means they’re cruelty-free and completely vegan.
The combination of these ingredients results in the wax wrap being flexible, self-sticking, and unscented.
Candelilla wax is normally two-times denser than beeswax, so this may mean the vegan wrap is less pliable than the beeswax wrap. The vegan wrap also can’t be easily mended with additional melted wax, unlike beeswax wraps.
Soy wax is a renewable resource, so using it in this wrap means an environmentally-sustainable product.
The tree resin and jojoba oil also provide additional properties. The tree resin provides natural antibacterial properties, while jojoba oil is a natural fluid plant wax and is anti fungal.
 

 
 
 
Cotton swabs are made from sustainably grown bamboo and cotton. They’re 100% biodegradable and come in a variety of colors - so you can add some flair to your bathroom. The bamboo stem ensures they’re ultra lightweight and strong. They’re designed to be more hygienically effective than your average plastic cotton swab.They're made with a thinner cotton tip which is recommended for a more effective clean. 
Bamboo’s eco-positive attributes continues to delight researchers…Recent studies have indicated that many bamboo products are not only carbon neutral, but carbon negative! Bamboo produces 30% more oxygen than your regular run-of-the-mill tree.Why Plastic-Cotton-Swabs Were Designed By The Devil.Plastic-cotton-swabs are only used once and then trashed or flushed down the toilet. Which means they end up in landfill or worse - our rivers and oceans, where they will stay FOREVER!What sucks even more about plastic-cotton-swabs is that they can not be recycled. These nasty mofos are made with the assistance of non-renewable oil in the manufacturing process. 
 


 
 
 
 
Stainless Steel Thermos
An eco-friendly stainless steel water bottle with all of the features you could hope for in a bottle-for-life. The bottle is leaf proof and chip resistant, with a wide mouth for easy drinking and cleaning. The 18/8 food grade stainless steel used to make the bottle and lid is a sustainable material, and is easily recyclable at the end of life (although we can't see a reason why your bottle won't last for life!). 
The double-walled construction gives the bottle vacuum superb insulation, keeping hot drinks hot for 12 hours and cold for 24 hours.
 
Tea drinkers rejoice. Safe and durable heated hydration storage bottle features a small removable infuser for loose leaf or regular tea bags, making it easy to brew or refill on the go - a unique and cute gift for mom or dad or anyone who enjoys tea outside the home
 
Make yourself a promise to take everywhere with you and refill, and avoid buying bottled water completely.


 
And others products:


 
 
My next objectives are:
 

Develop a platform to mobilize the proactive base of the city, giving impulse to initiatives of environmental activists and start-ups.
Create a transparent trust fund intended to finance social projects and start-ups which are aimed towards the development of the city.
Bring together thousands of people with practical intelligence to invest in the project and distribute funds to finance other initiatives.

    
The idea is to open Environmental Company which will become a successful example of uniting a community around a common cause. What makes Pagi Community unique is that 30% of the company profit will be reinvested in social projects aimed at the city’s development. The project will bring together thousands active citizens following their passion for high-quality environment development.
 
 
Ideas for reinvest:
 
Collaboration with Precious Plastic
 to set up Workshop

 
Recycling Mini Factory & Waste Management Company 
 

 
 
 We can produce from our waste such a cool staff as a manholes, paving slabs, curbs and other elements of improvement.
 

 
 

Polymer products are not only widely capable of replacing many other materials, but are also environmentally friendly. Distinguishing characteristics of paving slabs polymer sand:

Impact resistance

Resistance to external influences
The range of operating temperatures of paving slabs made of polymer is from -50 to +70 ° C, which allows its use in regions with a harsh climate. Durability, impact resistance and resistance to external influences and the effects of aggressive chemicals are confirmed by laboratory tests.

 
 
Next step is:
 
Purchase and instal Water Vending Machine
in Schools, Public places & Markets.
 

 
It can help to reduce all plastics which we are using daily
