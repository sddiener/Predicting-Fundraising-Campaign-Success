<h3>El proyecto</h3>
<p>Mi nombre es Blanca y quiero presentaros el proyecto que Andrés y yo iniciamos hace varios meses. Ambos queríamos encontrar un lugar hermoso para vivir, rodeados de naturaleza y tranquilidad, algo difícil de encontrar hoy en día. Queríamos crear un espacio no sólo para nosotros sino para cualquier persona que amara la naturaleza y que deseara inmersarse en ella, aprendiendo además cómo cuidar el medioambiente. Hace varios meses encontramos este terreno precioso, en un pueblito que es casi de cuento. Trabajamos mucho cada día para que este sea un lugar mágico. Ya hay varias personas por la región con proyectos de ecotecnias y nosotros queremos sumarnos a ellos, pero logrando llamar la atención de viajeros del mundo para que conozcan estos lugares. Nuestro trabajo es entonces construir unas cabañas y desde el ecoturismo generar conciencia medioambiental. Estamos a pocos pasos de hacerlo posible, ¡ayúdanos a lograrlo!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>¿Dónde invertiremos el dinero?</h3>
<p>El dinero se invertirá en terminar el baño de la cabaña de bambú, en hacer una cocina exterior y en el material para una cabaña más. Si no puedes ayudarnos económicamente, ¡ayúdanos a que corra la voz!</p>

</h3><h3>FIRST SOME SMALL TALK
&amp; LEADING IT IN</h3><h3></h3><p>
I was just procrastinating around on one Sunday evening, playing Gin Rummy on
my Xperia and listening to Daft Punk. Then I thought of something. <br/><br/>
What if I started a series of travel books... I'm a young Estonian writer - I
published my first book in November 2012 about a lonely france-obsessed
croissant, who, bullied by an army of pastry products, goes on an epic quest to
demolish the borders between sweet and salty, accompanied by his creator Ulvi
the Baker. <br/><br/>
Travel books are a genre usually dominated by guidance - what places to see,
what activities to do or what places someone saw and activities they accomplished.
Therefore I decided to approach the matter a little differently. If You happen
to be a Seinfeld fan then You know how Kramer had the idea to create a
""Coffee table book about coffee tables"". I can't say my idea is as ingenious
but I'm gonna try to approach travelling from a more specific/material angle
because when travelling, most people first see ’The Famous Church’, I first see
the small kiosk beside ’The Famous Church’. I bet I’m not the only one.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h3><b>IT'S ALL GOODS IN
HONG KONG! - No. 1 travel book for stuff hungry tourists.</b></h3><h3></h3><p>
Too much talk is too much talk. What I decided to go after is this - IT'S ALL
GOODS! - a possible series of travel books that focuses on the goods, the
products, the stuff of one specific location. <br/><br/>
The products that end up in this book must possess at least 1 of 2 factors -
WOW or WTF. WOW-factor means that it looks cool or even astonishing - package
design is uniquely eye-catching or the product itself stands out by its
shape/size/texture etc. WTF-factor means that it delivers the surprise by
weirdness - I'm sure You've heard of horse-flavoured ice-cream or Lay's chips
that taste like chicken and Pepsi - these examples would qualify. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h3><b>WHY START OFF WITH HONG
KONG?</b></h3>
<p>Because its tagline is ""Asia's World City"".
Because the vast array of funky goods won't leave anyone empty-handed. Because
it contains a blend of both asia and europe. Because I find it to be the best
place to start this series (if it will become that). </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h3><b>DEFINING THE GOODS</b></h3>
<p>Firstly – these goods do not have to be made in Hong Kong to
end up between the covers of this book – they can be weird delicacies from
Vietnam or extreme coolness from Antarctica – what matters is that one can get
these items while shopping in Hong Kong. Finding a hugely versatile selection
of all types of products from all over the globe is what makes up the essence
of shopping, in this particular case, of shopping and discovering the goodies’
side of Hong Kong.<br/></p><p>Secondly – the goods will be eatable/drinkable/usable, if
one can perform any on these mentioned activities with it then it is sure to be
a valued candidate. To clarify ’usable’ - 
if I happen to find pogo sticks with wheels or a laundry detergent
called ’Soap What?!’ then I see no reason why not to include them in the book. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h3><b>INSIDE THE BOOK</b></h3>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/204068/files/20131117113731-suitsupakk.jpg?1384717051"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/204069/files/20131117113804-gangnam.jpg?1384717084"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/204071/files/20131117113817-siselehed-cyber-toode.jpg?1384717097"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/204074/files/20131117113826-pulgad.jpg?1384717106"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>So, the book itself will contain a lot of pictures but

<p></p>
<p><span>One of the most popular requests we’ve heard is for a version of Kuna without the camera so that you can have pairs of matching lights at the door or around the house.</span></p>
<p>So we are pleased to announce that we will be producing a small batch of Kuna Companion lights! The Kuna companion matches Kuna visually, and connects wirelessly to Kuna so both lights will turn on and off in sync.  </p>Due to production constraints we’re only able to offer the Companion in very limited quantities right now, and only in the Craftsman model. The Kuna Companion Light requires pairing with a full Kuna light and will not function on its own. You can either add a Companion to your existing contribution for $79, or get a package with both for $228. Don’t wait, they’re going to go fast!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1044978/files/20141124230455-Products_4.png?1416899095"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<p><b>GENERAL</b></p>
<p><b>How does Kuna prevent break-ins?</b></p>
<p>Most burglars are looking for easy targets, meaning empty homes or a vulnerable person alone at home. They find these targets by knocking at the door and seeing who answers.  Kuna lets you speak to a potential burglar from anywhere, without making yourself vulnerable. If you answer the door using Kuna, a burglar knows someone can see them and knows they’re there, and they will move on to an easier target.</p>
<p><b>What’s the difference between Kuna and other Wi-Fi cameras?</b></p>
<p>The biggest difference is that we’ve designed Kuna from the outset to be an outdoor, preventive security solution. Other cameras are designed primarily to capture a recording of a break-in as it happens. Kuna is designed to give you the ability to take action before that happens, whether that’s using Kuna’s 2-way audio, the alarm, or simply calling the police. We’ve optimized Kuna’s intelligence specifically to reduce false alarms in outdoor scenes. And by building Kuna into an easy-to-install outdoor light fixture so you don’t have to drill mountings or run wires, we’ve also made Kuna the easiest outdoor camera system to install.</p>
<p><b>Is Kuna still useful when I’m home?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely! Most burglaries occur when there’s no one at home, but the 30% that happen when someone IS home are the most dangerous. Kuna lets you answer the door without opening the door and exposing yourself or revealing where you are. If you don’t feel comfortable speaking, you can have a friend or family member respond for you, or just play a pre-recorded message. In addition, our testers have found that Kuna is also great for alerting them to visitors when they can’t hear their doorbell, or when a delivery person drops off a package without ringing the doorbell at all.</p>
<p><b>Does Kuna replace my existing security system?</b></p>
<p>It’s up to you! Kuna is complementary to existing security systems, because it is a preventive solution that protects the entries of your home from the outside. If you’re not able to respond to the alerts that Kuna sends, these other systems can still be useful for giving a notification after a break-in happens.</p>
<p><b>How many Kunas should I get for my home?</b></p>
<p>Again, this is up to you! Our recommendation is to have at least two: one for the front door and one for the back door. This protects the two most important entrances to your home. Most burglars check at the front door before going to the back door. So if you get an alert at the front door, then a few minutes later get an alert at the back door, you know this is a serious situation you should respond to. In addition, many of our testers also want to have Kuna at their garage doors to keep an eye on their cars.</p>
<p><b>Where can I learn more about burglars and break-in prevention?</b></p>
<p>There are many great resources on this. We’ll be gathering them and posting updates on our Facebook page and on Twitter, so follow us!  </p>
<p><b>Why did you choose the name Kuna?</b></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Doesn't it just sound cool? Plus Kuna Peak is one of the highest peaks in Yosemite National Park, and we love that nice clean mountain air.  </p>
<br/><p><b>PURCHASING &amp; SHIPPING</b></p>
<p><b>How do I change my order/upgrade my perk/update my shipping address?</b></p>
<p>Just drop us a line at <a href=""mailto:support@getkuna.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@getkuna.com</a> and we'll get back to you ASAP!</p>
<p><b>How do I order a particular style of Kuna?</b></p>
<p>The other style and color options are available as upgrade options after choosing a perk package. Simply choose one of the packages for the Black Craftsman style, and make your contribution. Then come back and select the upgrade perk of your choice.</p>
<p><b>How do I order more than 2 Kuna units?</b></p>
<p>If you're so excited about Kuna that you want more than 2 units, that's possible too! Simply select one of the double packages and make your contribution. Then come back and select another package to get more!</p>
<p><b>Is there a paid subscription?</b></p>
<p>Person detection and live video/audio are absolutely free and included with the Kuna unit. Additional features like cloud recording will require a small monthly service cost, but these are optional. You will always be able to use Kuna without paying a monthly fee.</p>
<p><b>Does Kuna work outside the US/Canada?</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, right now we only support 110V power and shipping to US/Canada. For later versions we will definitely support international voltage and shipping. Make sure you sign up for our newsletter to keep updated.</p>
<p><b>Is shipping included?</b></p>
<p>Yes! The pledge price for each perk includes shipping.</p>
<p><b>Is there a warranty?</b></p>
<p>Every Kuna unit will come with at least a 1-year limited warranty. </p>
<p><b>I’m a contractor/installer/builder. I’m interesting in re-selling Kuna. How do I get in touch?</b></p>
<p>Drop us a line at <a href=""mailto:contact@getkuna.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact@getkuna.com</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b></p>
<p><b>Does Kuna pan, tilt, or zoom?</b></p>
<p>You can adjust Kuna’s camera angle manually, up to 40 degrees left, right, and down. With the wide-angle, 116 degree lens, you can get all the coverage you’ll need to cover any door. Once it is set, you can lock the lens position with the locking ring. The Kuna app allows for up to 2x digital zoom so that you can see anything suspicious in greater detail.</p>
<p><b>Does Kuna have night vision?</b></p>
<p>Instead of traditional infrared light, Kuna’s light can be set to turn on when motion is detected, so there is always sufficient light to view and record any events of interest.</p>
<p><b>Is Kuna weatherproof?</b></p>
<p>Yes! We’ve designed Kuna to work in outdoor conditions with high temperatures, including direct sunlight, and be weather resistant. In fact, we’ve just passed our IP44 weather-proofing test.</p>
<p><b>Can I unlock my door with Kuna?</b></p>
<p>Not yet, but in the future we hope to enable Kuna to work with popular electronic door locks like Lockitron and other smart home appliances.</p>
<p><b>Will Kuna have an open API?</b></p>
<p>Great question! Right now our first goal is to make sure that Kuna delivers on the promise of being the first and best break-in prevention product. Once we are sure we’ve delivered on the basic functionality, we will work on releasing our API so other devices and services will work with us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>INSTALLATION &amp; SETUP</b></p>
<p><b>How do I install Kuna?</b></p>
<p>Kuna installs just like any other light fixture. Just take down your old fixture and wire Kuna up to your existing power wires, then mount Kuna to your existing junction box.</p>
<p><b>How do I connect Kuna to the internet?</b></p>
<p>Just use your phone! The Kuna app will connect to Kuna via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and display a list of Wi-Fi routers that Kuna sees. Then you simply select your router and provide the password, and Kuna will take care of the rest.</p>
<p><b>How is Kuna powered? What happens if power or Wi-Fi goes out?</b></p>
<p>Kuna draws power continuously from the wall power, so that we can provide high quality video and detection. If your power or Wi-Fi go out, Kuna’s cloud servers will detect that Kuna is no longer connected and send you an alert on your phone. Once power or Wi-Fi come back, Kuna will re-connect automatically and start working again.</p>
<p><b>Do I have to leave my light switch on?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Kuna uses the wall power continuously, so you will have to leave the light switch on. If you’re worried about your switch, we can recommend some light-switch guards from Amazon that will help you keep your switch from getting accidentally turned off. Check us out on Facebook or follow us on Twitter for more useful tidbits of advice.</p>
<p><b>What if I have 2 or more light fixtures on the same switch?</b></p>
<p>We recommend that if you have two or more fixtures on the same switch, you should simply get more Kunas (hey, there’s a discount)! You can adjust the cameras so that they point at different angles, for example having one Kuna looking at the door and another looking out toward the street.</p>
<p><b>How do I know if the Wi-Fi signal at my door is strong enough?</b></p>
<p>The best way to check is to use your cell phone. Connect your phone to your Wi-Fi network, then put it where you’d install Kuna and see if you get 2 bars of Wi-Fi signal or more. If it is too weak, we recommend you move your router closer or invest in a Wi-Fi range extender or new router. Check in with the Kuna Facebook page to see our recommendations for routers and range extenders that work well with Kuna!</p>
<p><b>How many Kuna fixtures can I install at my home?</b></p>
<p>There’s no limit! Install as many Kuna units as you like, and you can see and connect to each of them from your phone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>USING KUNA</b></p>
<p><b>How do I access Kuna’s features?</b></p>
<p>You access Kuna’s live video and audio using the Kuna app on your smartphone. After Kuna is released we will also develop the ability to use Kuna via a web browser, but we will focus on the phone first.</p>
<p><b>Will I be able to access Kuna from different phones?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely! You can log in to Kuna from any phone you like, as long as you have the Kuna app downloaded. Just log in to your account and you will receive alerts and be able to connect to Kuna.</p>
<p><b>What phones or devices are supported for connecting to Kuna?</b></p>
<p>Kuna supports all iOS devices running iOS 7 and above (iPhone 4S and above, iPad 2 and above). Kuna will also support Android devices supporting Bluetooth LE and Android 4.4 and above (Kit Kat).</p>
<p><b>What is Kuna’s range of detection?</b></p>
<p>This depends on the exact location and environment where Kuna installed, but Kuna is designed to detect anyone coming within about 3 meters (10 feet) to catch anyone coming to an entry.</p>
<p><b>How does Kuna learn to improve its detection accuracy?</b></p>
<p>You will be able to give feedback to Kuna regarding its alerts. If Kuna gets a particular detection wrong, you’ll be able to give the correct label. We will anonymously incorporate this input into Kuna’s machine learning algorithms so that it will perform better in the future.</p>
<p><b>How can I control what alerts I get?</b></p>
<p>Kuna’s alerts are fully customizable. In addition to being able to turn the alerts on and off and temporarily disabling alerts for a set period of time, you’ll be able to select specific alerts to receive. To start, Kuna will be able to distinguish between persons arriving at the door and immediately entering the house, persons departing the house, and persons arriving and waiting at the door. You’ll be able to customize your alerts to receive any or all of these alerts.</p>

Kuna is a smart Wi-Fi camera with intercom, built into an outdoor light. It detects people coming to your home and lets you see and speak to them using your smartphone, from anywhere.

In addition to the camera and intercom, Kuna can act as an alarm siren and is a full-featured smart light. The Kuna app gives you full access to all of Kuna's features, whether you're at home, at work, or on the beach.   











“...a futuristic approach to security and break-in prevention.” -Brit + Co.
“The first step to protecting yourself and your home... is simply to make it appear that you're not an easy target. That's the idea behind Kuna.” -Popular Mechanics
“An affordable and aesthetic smart home product... you don't have to be an AV pro to install this” -Good Housekeeping
“...multiple features coming together... made smartphones so useful, and now the same thing is happening in home security cameras.” -The Verge 









Burglars are looking for easy targets, which means empty homes or someone alone at home. They move through a neighborhood knocking at doors and seeing who answers. If no one answers, that's when they decided to break in. With Kuna, you can speak to a potential burglar and let them know that someone sees them. They will move on to an easier target, one where no one knows they're there.  









Kuna lets you answer your door with your phone, from anywhere, at any time. Speaking to potential burglars will deter them, but you never want to make yourself vulnerable by opening the door to a stranger. Now you'll never have to. And you can answer the door for your kids when they're at home and you're not, or for your elderly parents at their house. Or even if you're just feeling too lazy to get off the couch.







Kuna combines sophisticated computer vision with IR motion sensing to filter out false alarms like swaying trees, small animals, and passing clouds. You'll also be able to give feedback, and Kuna will use this to learn over time to improve detection accuracy.






Kuna is a drop-in replacement for your existing light fixture. You use your existing wiring and wall mounting, and connect Kuna to Wi-Fi with your phone. No drilling, no running wires, no hassle.
 






Kuna is more than a security system, it's a smart light too. You can control the light from your phone, set a schedule, or use the dusk-to-dawn or motion-activated modes.






Great design brings everything together in harmony, whether it's components within a product or a product within its surroundings. Your home is the most important place in your life, and lights are part of the face it presents to the world. 
We worked with an award-winning industrial designer to create different styles of Kuna with the same amazing functionality, so it complements the look of your home. Whether your style is mission or modern, colonial or craftsman, Kuna will be there for you.





Check out the Style and Color Upgrades section for more details on how to choose a particular style or color of Kuna.





One of the most popular requests we’ve heard is for a version of Kuna without the camera so that you can have pairs of matching lights at the door or around the house.
So we are pleased to announce that we will be producing a small batch of Kuna Companion lights! The Kuna companion matches Kuna visually, and connects wirelessly to Kuna so both lights will turn on and off in sync.  Due to production constraints we’re only able to offer the Companion in very limited quantities right now, and only in the Craftsman model. The Kuna Companion Light requires pairing with a full Kuna light and will not function on its own. You can either add a Companion to your existing contribution for $79, or get a package with both for $228. Don’t wait, they’re going to go fast!





















Here's a quick guide to the perks you'll be able to select from when you support our campaign. You can select the package you'd like from the list at the top right. Be sure to take advantage of the discounts available if you get more than one!
Note: If you'd like to get more than 2 units, you will need to first choose a 2-unit package, then return and make another pledge for more units.








The Traditional and Contemporary styles and bronze color are available as upgrade perks. If you'd like either of these styles, just choose a Craftsman perk package, then contribute again to select the appropriate upgrade. The bronze color is available for Craftsman and Traditional styles only. Each upgrade covers your entire order, so if you're getting more than one Kuna you only have to choose one upgrade package. You can change your mind at any time before the campaign ends!




  

Using Kuna to prevent break-ins is free and always will be. The Kuna app and main functions are absolutely free, and you can use as many phones as you like to receive alerts, see live video, and talk. 
After Kuna ships, we will introduce (completely optional) service plans including options for recording video to the cloud. They will be contract-free, voluntary, and you won't need to sign up for them to use the app or to use Kuna.





We've worked hard to make Kuna a reality, and we're close! We are already most of the way through the production process with our manufacturer, with hardware design finalized and most tests completed, including environmental tests.  





We want to bring preventive home security to the world, and we need your help to spread the word. By joining us, you not only become the first to get Kuna, you become part of a community of users, helping us shape the future of home security!

GENERAL
How does Kuna prevent break-ins?
Most burglars are looking for easy targets, meaning empty homes or a vulnerable person alone at home. They find these targets by knocking at the door and seeing who answers.  Kuna lets you speak to a potential burglar from anywhere, without making yourself vulnerable. If you answer the door using Kuna, a burglar knows someone can see them and knows they’re there, and they will move on to an easier target.
What’s the difference between Kuna and other Wi-Fi cameras?
The biggest difference is that we’ve designed Kuna from the outset to be an outdoor, preventive security solution. Other cameras are designed primarily to capture a recording of a break-in as it happens. Kuna is designed to give you the ability to take action before that happens, whether that’s using Kuna’s 2-way audio, the alarm, or simply calling the police. We’ve optimized Kuna’s intelligence specifically to reduce false alarms in outdoor scenes. And by building Kuna into an easy-to-install outdoor light fixture so you don’t have to drill mountings or run wires, we’ve also made Kuna the easiest outdoor camera system to install.
Is Kuna still useful when I’m home?
Absolutely! Most burglaries occur when there’s no one at home, but the 30% that happen when someone IS home are the most dangerous. Kuna lets you answer the door without opening the door and exposing yourself or revealing where you are. If you don’t feel comfortable speaking, you can have a friend or family member respond for you, or just play a pre-recorded message. In addition, our testers have found that Kuna is also great for alerting them to visitors when they can’t hear their doorbell, or when a delivery person drops off a package without ringing the doorbell at all.
Does Kuna replace my existing security system?
It’s up to you! Kuna is complementary to existing security systems, because it is a preventive solution that protects the entries of your home from the outside. If you’re not able to respond to the alerts that Kuna sends, these other systems can still be useful for giving a notification after a break-in happens.
How many Kunas should I get for my home?
Again, this is up to you! Our recommendation is to have at least two: one for the front door and one for the back door. This protects the two most important entrances to your home. Most burglars check at the front door before going to the back door. So if you get an alert at the front door, then a few minutes later get an alert at the back door, you know this is a serious situation you should respond to. In addition, many of our testers also want to have Kuna at their garage doors to keep an eye on their cars.
Where can I learn more about burglars and break-in prevention?
There are many great resources on this. We’ll be gathering them and posting updates on our Facebook page and on Twitter, so follow us!  
Why did you choose the name Kuna?



Doesn't it just sound cool? Plus Kuna Peak is one of the highest peaks in Yosemite National Park, and we love that nice clean mountain air.  
PURCHASING & SHIPPING
How do I change my order/upgrade my perk/update my shipping address?
Just drop us a line at support@getkuna.com and we'll get back to you ASAP!
How do I order a particular style of Kuna?
The other style and color options are available as upgrade options after choosing a perk package. Simply choose one of the packages for the Black Craftsman style, and make your contribution. Then come back and select the upgrade perk of your choice.
How do I order more than 2 Kuna units?
If you're so excited about Kuna that you want more than 2 units, that's possible too! Simply select one of the double packages and make your contribution. Then come back and select another package to get more!
Is there a paid subscription?
Person detection and live video/audio are absolutely free and included with the Kuna unit. Additional features like cloud recording will require a small monthly service cost, but these are optional. You will always be able to use Kuna without paying a monthly fee.
Does Kuna work outside the US/Canada?
Unfortunately, right now we only support 110V power and shipping to US/Canada. For later versions we will definitely support international voltage and shipping. Make sure you sign up for our newsletter to keep updated.
Is shipping included?
Yes! The pledge price for each perk includes shipping.
Is there a warranty?
Every Kuna unit will come with at least a 1-year limited warranty. 
I’m a contractor/installer/builder. I’m interesting in re-selling Kuna. How do I get in touch?
Drop us a line at contact@getkuna.com



FEATURES
Does Kuna pan, tilt, or zoom?
You can adjust Kuna’s camera angle manually, up to 40 degrees left, right, and down. With the wide-angle, 116 degree lens, you can get all the coverage you’ll need to cover any door. Once it is set, you can lock the lens position with the locking ring. The Kuna app allows for up to 2x digital zoom so that you can see anything suspicious in greater detail.
Does Kuna have night vision?
Instead of traditional infrared light, Kuna’s light can be set to turn on when motion is detected, so there is always sufficient light to view and record any events of interest.
Is Kuna weatherproof?
Yes! We’ve designed Kuna to work in outdoor conditions with high temperatures, including direct sunlight, and be weather resistant. In fact, we’ve just passed our IP44 weather-proofing test.
Can I unlock my door with Kuna?
Not yet, but in the future we hope to enable Kuna to work with popular electronic door locks like Lockitron and other smart home appliances.
Will Kuna have an open API?
Great question! Right now our first goal is to make sure that Kuna delivers on the promise of being the first and best break-in prevention product. Once we are sure we’ve delivered on the basic functionality, we will work on releasing our API so other devices and services will work with us.



INSTALLATION & SETUP
How do I install Kuna?
Kuna installs just like any other light fixture. Just take down your old fixture and wire Kuna up to your existing power wires, then mount Kuna to your existing junction box.
How do I connect Kuna to the internet?
Just use your phone! The Kuna app will connect to Kuna via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and display a list of Wi-Fi routers that Kuna sees. Then you simply select your router and provide the password, and Kuna will take care of the rest.
How is Kuna powered? What happens if power or Wi-Fi goes out?
Kuna draws power continuously from the wall power, so that we can provide high quality video and detection. If your power or Wi-Fi go out, Kuna’s cloud servers will detect that Kuna is no longer connected and send you an alert on your phone. Once power or Wi-Fi come back, Kuna will re-connect automatically and start working again.
Do I have to leave my light switch on?
Yes. Kuna uses the wall power continuously, so you will have to leave the light switch on. If you’re worried about your switch, we can recommend some light-switch guards from Amazon that will help you keep your switch from getting accidentally turned off. Check us out on Facebook or follow us on Twitter for more useful tidbits of advice.
What if I have 2 or more light fixtures on the same switch?
We recommend that if you have two or more fixtures on the same switch, you should simply get more Kunas (hey, there’s a discount)! You can adjust the cameras so that they point at different angles, for example having one Kuna looking at the door and another looking out toward the street.
How do I know if the Wi-Fi signal at my door is strong enough?
The best way to check is to use your cell phone. Connect your phone to your Wi-Fi network, then put it where you’d install Kuna and see if you get 2 bars of Wi-Fi signal or more. If it is too weak, we recommend you move your router closer or invest in a Wi-Fi range extender or new router. Check in with the Kuna Facebook page to see our recommendations for routers and range extenders that work well with Kuna!
How many Kuna fixtures can I install at my home?
There’s no limit! Install as many Kuna units as you like, and you can see and connect to each of them from your phone.



USING KUNA
How do I access Kuna’s features?
You access Kuna’s live video and audio using the Kuna app on your smartphone. After Kuna is released we will also develop the ability to use Kuna via a web browser, but we will focus on the phone first.
Will I be able to access Kuna from different phones?
Absolutely! You can log in to Kuna from any phone you like, as long as you have the Kuna app downloaded. Just log in to your account and you will receive alerts and be able to connect to Kuna.
What phones or devices are supported for connecting to Kuna?
Kuna supports all iOS devices running iOS 7 and above (iPhone 4S and above, iPad 2 and above). Kuna will also support Android devices supporting Bluetooth LE and Android 4.4 and above (Kit Kat).
What is Kuna’s range of detection?
This depends on the exact location and environment where Kuna installed, but Kuna is designed to detect anyone coming within about 3 meters (10 feet) to catch anyone coming to an entry.
How does Kuna learn to improve its detection accuracy?
You will be able to give feedback to Kuna regarding its alerts. If Kuna gets a particular detection wrong, you’ll be able to give the correct label. We will anonymously incorporate this input into Kuna’s machine learning algorithms so that it will perform better in the future.
How can I control what alerts I get?
Kuna’s alerts are fully customizable. In addition to being able to turn the alerts on and off and temporarily disabling alerts for a set period of time, you’ll be able to select specific alerts to receive. To start, Kuna will be able to distinguish between persons arriving at the door and immediately entering the house, persons departing the house, and persons arriving and waiting at the door. You’ll be able to customize your alerts to receive any or all of these alerts.






PRIVACY
Is my video secure?
Absolutely. Kuna uses the same SSL and AES encryption to secure its connections as used by banks and credit-card processing companies.",45.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/>My recent trip to the orphange had opened my eyes. It saddens me that are many who needs our help as they are being neglected by society. Most of them suffered from brain damage and are just waiting for their time to end.  What made this unlike any other orphanage was that the orphanage housed deformed children who have been abandoned by their parents, with no one to care for them. <br/><br/>The orphanage was over-crowded and lacked government funding.

<p>One day, I needed to find myself. Instead of taking a walk in the park or looking around in the bookstore,  I borrowed my friends bicycle and went on a journey that had accumulated 10,000 miles.</p>
<p>This little adventure has gotten me featured in local newspapers, magazines and television. They learned of my journey and followed my adventure. It was then they dubbed me ""Super Printer Man"".</p>
<p><b>關於我</b></p>

<p>畢業後前路茫茫，每一個人也帶著無數問號走向人生的另一個階段。<br/><br/></p>
<p>但我選擇了先尋找自己對生活的答案，當時我向朋友借了一輛單車，展開了一場長途旅行，我希望進入另一個陌生的世界，不受朋輩及群眾壓力去選擇自己想要的生活。嘗試去了解自己想要一個怎樣的未來，我想知道我自己到底想要甚麼？我心底裡到底在渴求著甚麼？</p>
<p>至今累積的行程已經超過10,000公里。</p>

<p><b>我需要：</b></p>
<p>一輪新單車，過往旅行用的單車已經被使用得傷痕纍纍，雖然它還可以再使用一段日子，不過單車旅行的強度太大，我擔心它捱不過即將來臨的5000公里，所以一架新單車是最迫切需要的</p>
<p>如果可以籌得多一點的贊助，我會購買最新的Go pro 4戶外運動錄影機，拍攝更高質素的影片。質素會比現在我的那條宣傳片更加細緻，我肯定可以拍到更精彩的畫面。</p>
<p>假若在最幸運的情況下，贊助充裕，我會買一些更好的保護裝備，例如一個更好的頭盔及防水性能更好的外套，過往因為預算的問題，難以購買專業一點的裝備，結果在旅程裡，其中一場大風雪下，我差點冷死在山上。</p>

As I went through towns, my passport had been confiscated many times and I had to wait while they checked me for any weapons. All the while throwing my tent and things around.

<p><b>驚險事件：</b></p>
<p>當我身在巴基斯坦時，我曾為自己的人生安全感到擔心。因為巴基斯坦中部為部落間的武裝衝突地區，常有脅持外國人質事件發生。當我穿越這地區時，經常會被軍警截停，每幾分鐘就要停下來檢查，我的護照差點被他們翻破。有時候，太危險的路段，警察會不容許騎車穿越，會直接把我趕上警車帶走。</p>

Who am I?
My name is Stephen Chui.
One day, I needed to find myself. Instead of taking a walk in the park or looking around in the bookstore,  I borrowed my friends bicycle and went on a journey that had accumulated 10,000 miles.
This little adventure has gotten me featured in local newspapers, magazines and television. They learned of my journey and followed my adventure. It was then they dubbed me ""Super Printer Man"".
關於我
我是Stephen
所有故事發生在我大學三年級的暑假，進入社會工作前的最後階段。
那時候我強烈地討厭過著將來只有上班及下班的悶蛋生活。

畢業後前路茫茫，每一個人也帶著無數問號走向人生的另一個階段。
但我選擇了先尋找自己對生活的答案，當時我向朋友借了一輛單車，展開了一場長途旅行，我希望進入另一個陌生的世界，不受朋輩及群眾壓力去選擇自己想要的生活。嘗試去了解自己想要一個怎樣的未來，我想知道我自己到底想要甚麼？我心底裡到底在渴求著甚麼？
至今累積的行程已經超過10,000公里。
我的冒險旅程吸引到本地報章、雜誌及電視台的採訪。

2013年4月-8月  新疆喀什  → 巴基斯坦 : 伊斯蘭堡  → 西藏 : 獅泉河 → 西藏 : 拉薩 (新藏線)


Next Route:
2015:
January 2015 - April 2015 I will fly to Istanbul and start my 3 month long journey from there. The final destination will be Bandaar Abbas in Iran. After that I will take a boat to Dubai and hopefully return to Hong Kong from there. 土耳其 : 伊斯坦堡  → 格鲁吉亞 : 第比利斯  → 亞美尼亞 : 葉里溫   → 伊朗  → 杜拜
   What I Need  The brunt of the funding is going to go towards to a decent bicycle. The bicycle's I had used before were borrowed from friends and family. Though it was good enough, I didn't feel good when I returned it with dents, scuff's and tires repaired dozens of times. 
If I'm lucky and get enough funding, I will purchase one of the new affordable Go Pro's. As you can see from the video, I had something similar but it was not as high resolution as I hoped for. 
If I'm lucky and get more than asked for, it will go towards a bike helmet and a warmer coat. I used a very thin one and almost froze to death. 


我需要：
一輪新單車，過往旅行用的單車已經被使用得傷痕纍纍，雖然它還可以再使用一段日子，不過單車旅行的強度太大，我擔心它捱不過即將來臨的5000公里，所以一架新單車是最迫切需要的
如果可以籌得多一點的贊助，我會購買最新的Go pro 4戶外運動錄影機，拍攝更高質素的影片。質素會比現在我的那條宣傳片更加細緻，我肯定可以拍到更精彩的畫面。
假若在最幸運的情況下，贊助充裕，我會買一些更好的保護裝備，例如一個更好的頭盔及防水性能更好的外套，過往因為預算的問題，難以購買專業一點的裝備，結果在旅程裡，其中一場大風雪下，我差點冷死在山上。

  Risks & Challenges There were times when I was afraid for my life when in Pakistan or Afghanistan. As I went through towns, my passport had been confiscated many times and I had to wait while they checked me for any weapons. All the while throwing my tent and things around. At one point, they were so fed up with their soldiers stopping me every 2 minutes, they picked me up and drove me across the village towards my destination. 
I would like to continue my tradition of riding a bicycle and hope to inspire a generation who aren't afraid to drop what they're doing and just do something meaningful. Find who that someone is inside your heart and never stop looking! 

I hope to share my journey with you and others along the way. I wish that I can give hope to all those people who aren't brave enough to just pick up a bike and ride towards the sunset!
Dare to Dream!
Thank you!
Stephen Chui


驚險事件：
當我身在巴基斯坦時，我曾為自己的人生安全感到擔心。因為巴基斯坦中部為部落間的武裝衝突地區，常有脅持外國人質事件發生。當我穿越這地區時，經常會被軍警截停，每幾分鐘就要停下來檢查，我的護照差點被他們翻破。有時候，太危險的路段，警察會不容許騎車穿越，會直接把我趕上警車帶走。
而當時每晚住的酒店也是由警方安排，因為塔利班恐怖份子就隱藏在人群中，在酒店大堂會有一個持槍警員守在大堂，在酒店門外亦會有兩位警員把守。每一晚的氣氛都非常緊張，我不會知道是否能平安渡過。
我會繼續我的單車旅行，希望我的旅程可以啟發其他人勇於去做自己想做的事，那怕要付出一些代價。
每個人心裡都會有一粒關於夢想的種子，你總會有一件很想做但可能沒能力又或不敢做的事。我們都害怕去實行這件看似不能完成的事。
其實有時候，不需要考慮太多，想做就要去做。因為人生只有一次，錯過了，便恨錯難返。世界上有很多偉大的事，都源於一個瘋狂的幻想。
我希望透過分享我的故事，我的旅程。給予你實現夢想的勇氣，你永遠不知道自己的能力，直到自己受到考驗。敢於追夢

<p>“Most universal adapters do not contain a type M adapter and therefore only work in up to 160 countries. This means that should a user wish to travel to a country utilising the type M adapter, an additional specific and usually very bulky adapter has to be purchased.”</p>
<p>Ryan continues, “The design of the nomadplug overcomes the challenge of bulky travel adapters despite the very compact and appealing design, it keeps you ready at all times to charge your devices in all 195 countries in the world. One travel adapter, and quite literally a world of opportunities for the adventure seekers!”</p>

Everything about the suitcase is different, yet intuitive. Packing the Cubes was a new experience for me yet fun because everything had its own place.</p><p>For this vacation the whole family had their own suitcase, and the difference in functionality and ease of accessibility of the Pull Up Suitcase was clear not long after landing. While my sons with their regular suitcases were awkwardly fishing out their swim trunks in the parking lot, I simply pulled up my Pull Up Suitcase to take out my swim trunks.</p><p>At the hotel I don’t have to unpack, instead the suitcase is my closet. Our little mascot had its own place in the closet as well and was always smiling at us. It didn’t take long until I couldn’t imagine a vacation without this Suitcase that had turned into a valet stand.</p><p>The best part happened shortly before my departure in the Florida Airport. The lady at the check-in counter asked me about the design of my suitcase, so I told her about my new suitcase and all its advantages. I showed her the Pull Up technique – awesome! – it was like we were in a commercial! She got her coworker right away and presented the suitcase, meanwhile the people in line behind me saw it and promptly wanted to know where they could buy it.

I’m already done when she’s still tediously packing her suitcase.</p><p>At the ferry terminal, the English weather is already awaiting us – I quickly and simply open my suitcase to take out my rain jacket. It’s amazing to have a Pull Up suitcase! On the ferry I realize that I left my laptop charger in my suitcase - I’m so glad I put it in my Pull Up and not in any other suitcase, since there wouldn’t be enough room to open a conventional suitcase here, in between all the car rides.</p><p>At the hotel – while my partner is still unpacking her suitcase in order to get out her evening attire and annoyed with the lack of room between the bed and the wall – I’ve already pulled up my Suitcase and am now relaxed and waiting for her to be done. How have I ever travelled without the Pull Up?!</p><p>In the morning, we’re traveling to our second destination, I put my Travel Kit in my suitcase and I’m ready to go in a matter of seconds, while my partner’s suitcase has already been taken over by chaos after the first night.

The Pull Up Suitcase is a handy tool to help you organize any travel chaos. The collapsible suitcase enables you to systematically pack your clothes and personal items in separate compartments, which is the best way to guarantee that your trip is perfectly organized. 
Our convenient packing cubes help you to fulfill your individual, storage-related wishes. Using the mobile drawers, everything is neat, tidy and at your immediate disposal.



Everyone who travels a lot can relate to this: Traveling is nice, but it also bears a few challenges. However, the right equipment can help you overcome them smoothly. Imagine that you have arrived in a hotel room and would like to access the contents of your suitcase.
A conventional suitcase would have to be be placed on the ground and opened. The space is limited. You would have to unpack your entire suitcase and put the contents into the storage spaces of the hotel room. This is time-consuming and annoying.
With the Pull Up Suitcase, this does not pose a problem for you. 

Your patented suitcase functions as a mobile closet. Just pull the top upwards and you can access all the packing cubes containing your belongings straightaway. Everything is at your disposal immediately and neat and tidy - just like at home. And it doesn't matter how big or small your hotel room is.  
Speaking of neat and tidy; Surely you must know the feeling when you are searching for something specific in your suitcase or your travel bag. Where do you usually end up finding it? At the very bottom. Now picture this situation with the Pull Up Suitcase: You look into the convenient packing cubes inside the suitcase, use the mobile drawers, and, in the blink of an eye, you have already found what you were looking for.  There's plenty of things you want to take care of on the way. Your luggage is no longer part of it. Because no matter how often you look for something, take it out of your suitcase or pack it up again: The contents always remain just as perfectly tidy as before. Everything is neatly stowed away and well organized. That's how it has to be. Traveling with the Pull Up Suitcase is nothing short of ingenious. Everything about the suitcase is different, yet intuitive. Packing the Cubes was a new experience for me yet fun because everything had its own place.For this vacation the whole family had their own suitcase, and the difference in functionality and ease of accessibility of the Pull Up Suitcase was clear not long after landing. While my sons with their regular suitcases were awkwardly fishing out their swim trunks in the parking lot, I simply pulled up my Pull Up Suitcase to take out my swim trunks.At the hotel I don’t have to unpack, instead the suitcase is my closet. Our little mascot had its own place in the closet as well and was always smiling at us. It didn’t take long until I couldn’t imagine a vacation without this Suitcase that had turned into a valet stand.The best part happened shortly before my departure in the Florida Airport. The lady at the check-in counter asked me about the design of my suitcase, so I told her about my new suitcase and all its advantages. I showed her the Pull Up technique – awesome! – it was like we were in a commercial! She got her coworker right away and presented the suitcase, meanwhile the people in line behind me saw it and promptly wanted to know where they could buy it. I was happy – a great vacation in the USA.One big and significant difference is already clear when we start packing: while my partner has to place her suitcase on the bed in order to pack it, because there is not enough room in the bedroom, I conveniently put my suitcase next to the closet and simply repack the shelves. I’m already done when she’s still tediously packing her suitcase.At the ferry terminal, the English weather is already awaiting us – I quickly and simply open my suitcase to take out my rain jacket. It’s amazing to have a Pull Up suitcase! On the ferry I realize that I left my laptop charger in my suitcase - I’m so glad I put it in my Pull Up and not in any other suitcase, since there wouldn’t be enough room to open a conventional suitcase here, in between all the car rides.At the hotel – while my partner is still unpacking her suitcase in order to get out her evening attire and annoyed with the lack of room between the bed and the wall – I’ve already pulled up my Suitcase and am now relaxed and waiting for her to be done. How have I ever travelled without the Pull Up?!In the morning, we’re traveling to our second destination, I put my Travel Kit in my suitcase and I’m ready to go in a matter of seconds, while my partner’s suitcase has already been taken over by chaos after the first night. I’m certain that this is going to be a relaxed vacation for me.Our CEO Matthias demonstrates how to correctly open the Pull Up Suitcase in the video below: How to open the Pull Up Suitcase:1. Pull the switch on the TSA Lock upwards and downwards to release the zipper ends.  2. Ensure that the telescopic handle is fully collapsed. Move the zipper around the whole body of the suitcase until it is fully open.3. Push and hold the 2 buttons on both the left and right side of the lid.4. Hold the 2 handles on the side of the lid firmly. Pull up the whole top part of the suitcase at the same time until it locks into place. 5. Open the zipper on the front of the case. The content is now accessible.   How to pack the Pull Up Suitcase without video editing:  From socks to shirts, our packing cubes organize everything inside the Pull Up Suitcase. This makes packing a lot easier, especially when packing and repacking the suitcase during travel.  See in a video how to pack for a 7-day business trip: The following packing cubes are complimentary with every Pull Up Suitcase: The Dopp Kit offers a quick and easy way of storing your toiletries. The Small Box provides a separate compartment for your underwear, socks and other small items. While the three Big Boxes provide space for your T-shirts, trousers and sweaters, the Shoe Bag is a designated space for your shoes. Your suit coats and shirts find room in the Garment Bag. Pack everything up: Documents, your laptop or business cards can be stored in the convenient outside pocket, where they are always ready to hand when you may need them. There is no such thing as too much of a good thing: The extra wide Telescopic Handle allows for a better and more stable handling of the suitcase. Handy and comfortable: You can carry your suitcase by the handles on top as well as at the bottom of it. A little helper, just in case: the side handle. That way you can easily load it into the car or gather it from the baggage conveyor belt.  Your desk to go: No matter whether you would like to quickly jot something down, put down your laptop or simply eat something on the way, the flat top surface serves as your table for any purpose.  Travel safely: Due to the 360-degree wheels, your suitcase is not only extremely flexible, but also safe, since the wheels function as reflectors in the dark.We have 3 warehouses worldwide that allow us to offer low-cost domestic shipping to all EU countries, USA, Canada, Mexico, China, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Resources Institute, along with the Nature Conservancy, the WorldFish Center,
the International Coral Reef Action Network, Global Coral Reef Monitoring
Network, and the UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Center, and a network of
more than 25 partner organizations, including NOAA. For the first time, the
analysis includes threats from climate change, including warming seas and
rising ocean acidification.</p>
<p><b>The most immediate and direct threats arise
from local sources, which currently threaten more than 60% of coral reefs.
Local threats include impacts from fishing, coastal development, and pollution.
Left unchecked, the percent of threatened reefs will increase to more than 90%
by 2030 and to nearly all reefs by 2050.</b></p><p><b>
</b></p><p><b>Governments have ignored the marine biologists’ on-going
warnings about the severe loss of coral reefs, failed to educate their
citizens, and the result is our coral reefs are ALL dying.  Today it is estimated that 60% of the coral
reefs are dead and most of the remaining 40% are dying.  </b></p><b>
</b><p>Tony Webb, Managing Director for Planet Ocean Underwater Hotel, searched for the world’s best
coral reef restoration technology, and found it in Biorock® Technology.
Invented by the late Prof. Wolf Hilbertz and Dr. Tom Goreau, this revolutionary
technology allows corals to grow many times faster than
conventional methods, and to resist environmental stresses that would otherwise
kill them.  As a result entire coral
reefs can be kept alive when they would die from high temperatures, and
restored in a few years in places where there has been no natural recovery.
<b>Literally, this technology is our best hope to help save Planet Ocean from
impending worldwide coral reef extinction. 
</b></p><b>
</b><p>Approximately 100 yards off the
coast of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea in Southeast Florida there is a new Bio<b>r</b>ock
coral reef that has now has the highest live coral cover in Florida.  This provides visible proof that Bio<b>r</b>ock
works in Florida, just as in hundreds of reef restoration projects all around
the world.</p>
<p>Because of massive lack of funding to support the building
of new coral reef systems in impoverished third world countries and islands, Planet Ocean Underwater Hotel project will donate a portion of its profits<b> </b> to the
Global Coral Reef Alliance, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization working with
poor fishing villages around the world to help them restore and maintain their
fisheries.  </p>
<p>Now is the time for the world to help fund the prototype for
Planet Ocean Underwater Hotel.</p>
<p>Years ago, Lee Iacocca, former CEO of Ford and Chrysler led the nation to crowdsourcing to
restore The Statue of Liberty,  and $200 million was raised. Through generous
support from the public, Lady Liberty now stands majestically renewed in New York
harbor. It was Iacocca's vision, like Tony Webb's that our national monument was preserved for posterity. Now our coral reefs need our help! </p>
<p>We are seeking funding though the Indiegogo crowdsourcing
fundraising Internet platform, because venture capitalists, banks, and
investors lacked the vision to restore coral reefs, and none took the time to
listen.  Now we are turning to the people
and if the people want this then the people will have it.</p>
<p>Now there is another person who can and will make a
difference and that is YOU.  For as
little as $10.00 you can show your support or purchase other Indiegogo perks at
the Planet Ocean Underwater Hotel page. All of our world-wide work is 100%
dependent on your support. </p>

coral reef restoration technology, and found it in Biorock® Technology.
Invented by the late Prof. Wolf Hilbertz and Dr. Tom Goreau, this revolutionary
technology allows corals to grow many times faster than
conventional methods, and to resist environmental stresses that would otherwise
kill them.  As a result entire coral
reefs can be kept alive when they would die from high temperatures, and
restored in a few years in places where there has been no natural recovery.
Literally, this technology is our best hope to help save Planet Ocean from
impending worldwide coral reef extinction. 

Approximately 100 yards off the
coast of Lauderdale-By-The-Sea in Southeast Florida there is a new Biorock
coral reef that has now has the highest live coral cover in Florida.  This provides visible proof that Biorock
works in Florida, just as in hundreds of reef restoration projects all around
the world.
Because of massive lack of funding to support the building
of new coral reef systems in impoverished third world countries and islands, Planet Ocean Underwater Hotel project will donate a portion of its profits  to the
Global Coral Reef Alliance, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization working with
poor fishing villages around the world to help them restore and maintain their
fisheries.  
Now is the time for the world to help fund the prototype for
Planet Ocean Underwater Hotel.
Years ago, Lee Iacocca, former CEO of Ford and Chrysler led the nation to crowdsourcing to
restore The Statue of Liberty,  and $200 million was raised. Through generous
support from the public, Lady Liberty now stands majestically renewed in New York
harbor. It was Iacocca's vision, like Tony Webb's that our national monument was preserved for posterity. Now our coral reefs need our help! 
We are seeking funding though the Indiegogo crowdsourcing
fundraising Internet platform, because venture capitalists, banks, and
investors lacked the vision to restore coral reefs, and none took the time to
listen.  Now we are turning to the people
and if the people want this then the people will have it.
Now there is another person who can and will make a
difference and that is YOU.  For as
little as $10.00 you can show your support or purchase other Indiegogo perks at
the Planet Ocean Underwater Hotel page. All of our world-wide work is 100%
dependent on your support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

THE
IMPACT - 
The Freedom Resort Clubs management understands that travel costs have risen
dramatically. Along with gas, food, hotels, etc. Inflation has played a part in
the increased costs of traveling. Unfortunately, for most families, their
income has not increased at the same rate. With this in mind, the Freedom
Resort Club has decided to make a sorted effort to once again make vacations affordable
for families by making it feasible to stay in beautiful 1-4 bedroom resort
condos while allowing members to take full advantage of Freedom Resort Clubs
plethora of amenities.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>See, the Wuvo Spot has a range of a hundred feet. Every user with the Wuvo app installed on their phones extends that range by an extra 100 feet. While the technology is super helpful here, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">the lost &amp; found feature makes it even better.

<h3>How it works</h3>
</div>
</div><p>Every Wuvo Spot has a unique ID code printed on the back. This unique code allows anyone who finds your Spot to reach out to you just by filling out a form on our website.</p><p>Once the finder enters their details and notes on your lost item, a notification containing all these critical information is then sent immediately to you. You'll receive a notification on the app and also in your email. From there you can contact the finder directly through phone, SMS or email and arrange for it to be returned to you.

<h3><b>Possible Risk &amp; Challenges - Things To Bear In Mind</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Just so we are 100% upfront, we've worked very hard developing the Wuvo Spot. However, there will always be improvements and innovations that we hope we'll be informed by your feedback. By pledging to support this innovation you are doing so with the understanding that this is a new product that you are making possible - allowing technology to be realized.</p>
<p><b>MANUFACTURING:</b> We are working closely with a manufacturer who has been able to produce the Wuvo Spots at a high quality so we have already resolved some of the manufacturing challenges. However, if we were to instantly scale to a huge volume it will still require additional tooling and production equipment and this is where some delays could occur.</p>
<p><b>FULFILLMENT: </b>We've fulfilled and shipped our initial batch of 5000 beta units within 48 hours from taking orders. Despite the best planning, there may be factors that we cannot control such as equipment malfunction, transport or supplier delays. </p>
<p><b>SOFTWARE BUGS (MOBILE APPs): </b>We've done our best in doing QA tests for our iOS and Android apps, however there will always be bugs, improvements and innovations that we can always improve on with your feedback. As a startup with limited resources, we've been able to push out new updates for our apps almost at a weekly basis. So if you found a bug while using the app, please let us know :)<br/></p>
<p><b>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS:</b> Extensive testing of the latest Wuvo Spot design has taken place over the past year and we think we have a product that is ready for the market. However better or critical adjustments may be made along the way (as we can’t think of everything). This will result in a better product but may delay production or shipment in some cases. Good or bad, that's why we always appreciate your feedback.<br/></p>

The Wuvo Spot is a simple and affordbale way to keep track of your items. Just stick it to your keys, wallet, glasses, luggage, headphones or whatever you don't want to lose, and Wuvo Spot does the rest.













Did you know that an average person spends over 10 minutes a day just looking for stuff they've misplaced? If you're late for work or are hurrying up for a hot date--those 10 minutes count.
Point is, we've all been there. We've been late on dates and important meetings because of the simple, annoying fact that we can't seem to find where we last left our keys. 

That's why we've spent a great deal of effort, research and personal experience to design the Wuvo Spot - a unique Bluetooth item finder that helps you locate your misplaced items.



In a Nutshell: Why the Wuvo Spot?

Super Affordable
Increases Recovery Chance Of Lost Items
Saves You Valuable Time
Replaceable Battery
Free Shipping Worldwide







Track your stuff at less cost.
The Wuvo Spot IS the most affordable tracker in the market (it's about 30-60% cheaper than most trackers, actually). Still, that doesn't mean we'll force you on a subscription to buy a new one once the battery runs out--unlike some guys out there.





On top of that, there really are some things you don't want to lose:
Not Your Ordinary Tracker: Wuvo Spot
Most trackers ignore 2 things. 1) It can run out of batteries.  2) The power of traditional offline lost and found community. With the Wuvo Spot, anybody worldwide (with or without the app) who finds your lost item can easily reach out to you just by visiting Wuvo's lost & found website. In just 2 simple steps, it makes a difference to the owner.  There's so many good samaritans around the world who is willing to go the extra mile in returning it to the owners. So we're making it easy for these good-hearted finders to do the good deed as well.






Helping Lost Items Find Their Way Home

The most common reason that lost items are not returned to their owners is the inability to identify the owner of these lost items. Wuvo changes that and makes it easy for the finders to contact their rightful owners directly.

See, the Wuvo Spot has a range of a hundred feet. Every user with the Wuvo app installed on their phones extends that range by an extra 100 feet. While the technology is super helpful here, the lost & found feature makes it even better. It increases and extends the recovery rate of your item indefinitely. Anyone around the world outside our Wuvo community can also play a important part in returning your lost item to you.











How it works

Every Wuvo Spot has a unique ID code printed on the back. This unique code allows anyone who finds your Spot to reach out to you just by filling out a form on our website.Once the finder enters their details and notes on your lost item, a notification containing all these critical information is then sent immediately to you. You'll receive a notification on the app and also in your email. From there you can contact the finder directly through phone, SMS or email and arrange for it to be returned to you. It’s super easy, direct and immediate. 
In addition, Wuvo protects the security and
privacy of the user through the ID code system. Each
code corresponds to an item and can only be
interpreted when it is marked as lost by the owner. Thus ensuring that the
identity of the owner is never disclosed to the finder.
The Wuvo Community
Aside from The Spot's lost & found feature, every person who has the app installed on their phones can also act as a finder once you mark your item as lost. 
Once they come near your item, the Wuvo app will anonymously send your item's location to the cloud. You then get notified where your item is last seen.

<h3>A Tour Like No Other.</h3>

<h3>Sustainability Starts With You.</h3>
<p>We love nature, and we're tired of pointing fingers. So we are making a stand, and taking responsibility for our own actions. We have found that environmental conservation comes back to our daily actions as humans, and we believe that taking small actions every day is the path to sustainability.</p>
<p>Some might say that one person can't make a difference, but we know better. Throughout history, the insight and ingenuity of a single Creative Animal has changed the world countless times. </p>
<p>However, when a group of like-minded individuals stands together, exponential change can occur. So, we're searching for 1 million people who are up to the challenge to do what they can to live, work, and play more sustainably. </p>
<p>The key word is ""more."" Everyone has a role to play, and every one of us has room to improve.  </p>
<p>As Americans, we are one of the most wasteful countries on the planet. We want to change that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491229401/htwciaxoyllcgklxab0j.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The average American consumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 gallons of water/per day</li>
<li>200 pounds of plastic/per year</li>
<li>30 kilowatt hours of electricity/per day</li>

<p>That's roughly double our closest competitor, the United Kingdom</p>

<h3>50 Cities</h3>
<p>We are planning to visit 50 cities over the next 18-24 months, plus a whole bunch of towns, parks, and places in-between. We knew early on in the planning process that we couldn't put a figure on all the places we would go, so we're only really counting the cities and Troop Members. But we will stop by our amazing national parks to show off the wildlife and wild places we're working to protect. We will go to the small towns and the farms that fuel America. And best of all, we'll be seeing you on the road in all the in-betweens. If you you see us, give us a honk, a wave, and snap a picture for social media and let us know you saw us rolling down the highway.</p>

<h3>Why A Tour?</h3>
<p>We know that nothing beats the impact of meeting people face to face. By visiting people where they live, work, and play – in schools, universities, festivals, businesses, and state capitols – we will maximize our reach. And to make it exciting for The Troop to follow the adventure, we decided that the only way to do it was a tour. </p>
<h3>By Joining The Troop, This Tour Belongs To You</h3>
<p>Because we're a public non-profit, supporters of this campaign will be taking ownership of the tour. And we want to involve them in the planning process. We have specifically not planned our exact tour route to leave it open to public opinion. Think we should visit your local wildlife refuge and show off what the biologists are doing? Awesome.

<h3>What We'll Be Doing On Tour</h3>
<p>We will be building a group of like-minded individuals: a community, a consortium, a consortium of 1,000,000 people over the course of the tour. This will be The Troop. We'll be searching for members in many ways, this Indiegogo campaign being one. From face-to-face meetings on college campuses, retirees passing us on the interstate (Tim tends to drive excessively slowly, ha ha!) to millennials finding us doing awesome things on the internet.</p>

<ul><li>
<h3>Speaking</h3>
<ul><li> We love to speak to groups of all sizes, from school classrooms of 30 kids, to auditoriums of 1,000 or more. But what we love the most is meeting face to face and having one-on-one conversations. We'll be doing all of the above on the tour.</li></ul>

<ul><li>
<h3>Filming </h3>
<ul><li>We love to film interesting stories about our favorite wild animals and the people using their creativity to help protect the ecosystems we all share. Regardless of financial, political, or racial background, we know that a love for animals and nature is one thing that brings us together. We'll also share Tim and Steph's adventure on Tour and how they are trying to live, work, and play more sustainably. </li></ul>

<ul><li>
<h3>Open Houses</h3>
<ul><li> We've found that a lot of people have seen or heard about how ""Going Tiny"" can help them live a more sustainable lifestyle. And while they've seen Tiny Homes on TV, online, or in a magazine, most people have yet to step foot in one. We want to give them the opportunity to see one in real life.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491264799/pnt2yaiekbirznqwudmd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why A Tiny House?</h3>
<p>In planning the tour, we researched every type of RV as a mobile tour bus. We contemplated everything from van-life to behemoth Class A buses. We were stuck on a travel trailer for a long time, and we even thought about fixing up an Airstream. In the end, Stephanie woke up one day and decided, ""Let's get a Tiny Home and get on TV."" </p>
<p>Everyone on the team thought she was crazy, mainly Tim. But just a few months and a few weary phone-dialing &amp; email-typing fingers later, Tim and Steph were moving into a Tiny Home on Wheels provided by the awesome team at 84 Lumber | Tiny Living after wrapping up filming for HGTV and DIY Network's show, <i>Tiny House, Big Living.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491265026/zgavhtuswacblmp4tpsp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491264889/flx2ru1ztoc0lp8joafz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the end, a Tiny Home not only could serve as a mobile tour bus, but it fit our message perfectly. On the tour, the Tiny Home will serve as a mobile metaphor of the ""Tiny Home"" that we all share: our planet. We want to show that by downsizing and living more sustainably, the Tiny Home can provide a healthier life and go further. Tiny Homes also can be more sustainable than a traditional RV by using wood construction instead of particle board and plastic. Without all of the toxic chemicals in the manufacturing process, it also provides a healthier home for its occupants.</p>

<h3>This Is Where Indiegogo Comes In</h3>
<p>As supporters of this campaign, you'll be some of the first to get this mission going. More specifically, we are asking for: </p>
<ul>
<li>Troop Members: As we mentioned above, we are looking for 1 million people who love nature, just like you,  to join us. </li>
<li>As a Troop Member, we would be forever grateful if you will subscribe to our YouTube channel. Here's the deal: the more people subscribe, the more the algorithms favor our videos and, eventually, the more money we will raise through YouTube advertisers. If you don't have a dime to give to the campaign, that YouTube subscription will go a long ways, too.</li>
<li>In exchange for some awesome perks, we're looking for some money to get the tour rolling down the road and to help fund low-income schools that can't afford to bring in outside programming.</li>
<li>Our initial goal for this campaign is $25k. This isn't enough to cover everything we hope to do, so we're also searching for a like-minded Title Sponsor. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get For Backing Our Campaign: Perks!</h3>
<p>Not only will you be a member of our Troop, you can get any of our awesome perks, from a sticker to a weekend in the Tiny House. Here are a few that might need some clarification:</p>
<h3>Stickers</h3>
<ul>
<li>We did a poll to see which sticker people liked the most. The results were highly inconclusive, some of both the Rectangular Bumper Sticker and the Oval Sticker.</li>
<li>(Note: The die-cut one in the picture was our original mock-up; people wanted it to say, ""I Am A Creative Animal"")</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h3>Tour T-Shirts</h3>
<ul>
<li>We've had a crazy amount of requests for T-shirts with Carl, our mascot. (He's cute, right?!) The time has come for us to send Carl out into the world on our Troop Members. He will keep your chest company on any size organic cotton tee you'd like.</li>
<li>Don't worry if you order one now and another later. We'll ask you for sizes at the end of the campaign and ship them where ever you'd like.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h3>Original Artwork</h3>
<ul><li>Get an original work of art by wildlife artist and Tour Host Timothy Davison.

<h3>Know a Company That Could Be Title Sponsor?</h3>
<p>We are looking for a like-minded sponsor who is excited to help a whole lot of people live more sustainably. In exchange for the a great marketing opportunity and a great tax write-off, we will be able to take our inspirational and educational message to schools and universities at no cost.However, we know we can only do so much in the brief time we spend at a given place.</p>
<p>That's where technology comes in. Real change happens when a student is reminded of our message a few weeks or a few months after our visit by seeing one of our YouTube videos, blogs, or other social media posts. They might change their major after watching a biologist who is saving the coral reefs, or get inspired by a student project that is protecting local wildlife, or learn how to save energy on a daily basis: </p>

<h3>What We Would Do with Title Sponsorship Funding:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Offer all educational presentations on The Creative Animal Tour for free, courtesy of our new Title Sponsor</li>
<li>Hire support staff: <ul>
<li>Video Editor: Tim and Steph can only do so much. With the help of an additional video editor, our team can produce much more educational video content, something to keep motivating the entire Troop.</li>
<li>Public Relations/Marketing: to maximize the reach of the tour, Tim and Steph would rather go to schools and film content rather than make phone calls and write emails to set up future tour stops. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The sky is the limit: beyond the necessities, our team is willing to do any number of exciting ideas centered on the tour.<ul>
<li>Scholarships/grants: We would love to help younger Creative Animals accomplish their goals and see their innovative ideas through to fruition.</li>
<li>Develop a Mobile App for The Troop: We have been approached by several groups who suggest that a mobile app is the best way to engage The Troop.</li>

Sustainability Starts With You.
We love nature, and we're tired of pointing fingers. So we are making a stand, and taking responsibility for our own actions. We have found that environmental conservation comes back to our daily actions as humans, and we believe that taking small actions every day is the path to sustainability.
Some might say that one person can't make a difference, but we know better. Throughout history, the insight and ingenuity of a single Creative Animal has changed the world countless times. 
However, when a group of like-minded individuals stands together, exponential change can occur. So, we're searching for 1 million people who are up to the challenge to do what they can to live, work, and play more sustainably. 
The key word is ""more."" Everyone has a role to play, and every one of us has room to improve.  
As Americans, we are one of the most wasteful countries on the planet. We want to change that.

The average American consumes:

100 gallons of water/per day
200 pounds of plastic/per year
30 kilowatt hours of electricity/per day

That's roughly double our closest competitor, the United Kingdom

40 gallons of water/per day
100 pounds of plastic/per year
15 kilowatt hours of electricity/per day


Let's say that 1 million average Americans cut their usage in half – the results would be staggering. In one year, we would:

Save 18 billion gallons of water
Eliminate 100 million tons of (mostly single-serving) plastic waste
Reduce CO2 emissions by 10 million tons annually

 

50 Cities
We are planning to visit 50 cities over the next 18-24 months, plus a whole bunch of towns, parks, and places in-between. We knew early on in the planning process that we couldn't put a figure on all the places we would go, so we're only really counting the cities and Troop Members. But we will stop by our amazing national parks to show off the wildlife and wild places we're working to protect. We will go to the small towns and the farms that fuel America. And best of all, we'll be seeing you on the road in all the in-betweens. If you you see us, give us a honk, a wave, and snap a picture for social media and let us know you saw us rolling down the highway.

Why A Tour?
We know that nothing beats the impact of meeting people face to face. By visiting people where they live, work, and play – in schools, universities, festivals, businesses, and state capitols – we will maximize our reach. And to make it exciting for The Troop to follow the adventure, we decided that the only way to do it was a tour. 
By Joining The Troop, This Tour Belongs To You
Because we're a public non-profit, supporters of this campaign will be taking ownership of the tour. And we want to involve them in the planning process. We have specifically not planned our exact tour route to leave it open to public opinion. Think we should visit your local wildlife refuge and show off what the biologists are doing? Awesome. Think we should interview your favorite band and put a spotlight on their sustainability efforts? Great. Know a representative or senator who is going above and beyond to protect nature? We want to know.


What We'll Be Doing On Tour
We will be building a group of like-minded individuals: a community, a consortium, a consortium of 1,000,000 people over the course of the tour. This will be The Troop. We'll be searching for members in many ways, this Indiegogo campaign being one. From face-to-face meetings on college campuses, retirees passing us on the interstate (Tim tends to drive excessively slowly, ha ha!) to millennials finding us doing awesome things on the internet.
In addition to those things:



Speaking
 We love to speak to groups of all sizes, from school classrooms of 30 kids, to auditoriums of 1,000 or more. But what we love the most is meeting face to face and having one-on-one conversations. We'll be doing all of the above on the tour.

 
 



Filming 
We love to film interesting stories about our favorite wild animals and the people using their creativity to help protect the ecosystems we all share. Regardless of financial, political, or racial background, we know that a love for animals and nature is one thing that brings us together. We'll also share Tim and Steph's adventure on Tour and how they are trying to live, work, and play more sustainably. 

 



Open Houses
 We've found that a lot of people have seen or heard about how ""Going Tiny"" can help them live a more sustainable lifestyle. And while they've seen Tiny Homes on TV, online, or in a magazine, most people have yet to step foot in one. We want to give them the opportunity to see one in real life.


Why A Tiny House?
In planning the tour, we researched every type of RV as a mobile tour bus. We contemplated everything from van-life to behemoth Class A buses. We were stuck on a travel trailer for a long time, and we even thought about fixing up an Airstream. In the end, Stephanie woke up one day and decided, ""Let's get a Tiny Home and get on TV."" 
Everyone on the team thought she was crazy, mainly Tim. But just a few months and a few weary phone-dialing & email-typing fingers later, Tim and Steph were moving into a Tiny Home on Wheels provided by the awesome team at 84 Lumber | Tiny Living after wrapping up filming for HGTV and DIY Network's show, Tiny House, Big Living.


In the end, a Tiny Home not only could serve as a mobile tour bus, but it fit our message perfectly. On the tour, the Tiny Home will serve as a mobile metaphor of the ""Tiny Home"" that we all share: our planet. We want to show that by downsizing and living more sustainably, the Tiny Home can provide a healthier life and go further. Tiny Homes also can be more sustainable than a traditional RV by using wood construction instead of particle board and plastic. Without all of the toxic chemicals in the manufacturing process, it also provides a healthier home for its occupants.

Take a tour of the house and meet our Tiny Home Expert: Andrew Odom


You can also get something from Andrew Odom in the perks section: a copy of Turning Tiny hand-signed by the Tiny r(E)volution guru himself!

Have you ever wondered how other people chose to live a tiny house life? Curious to know more about the small-living paradigm that's reshaping the way we think, live and dream? 
With contributions by over 60 tiny house luminaries, this hardback book is a resource for those interested in the tiny house movement. (autographed by Andrew M. Odom)


This Is Where Indiegogo Comes In
As supporters of this campaign, you'll be some of the first to get this mission going. More specifically, we are asking for: 

Troop Members: As we mentioned above, we are looking for 1 million people who love nature, just like you,  to join us. 
As a Troop Member, we would be forever grateful if you will subscribe to our YouTube channel. Here's the deal: the more people subscribe, the more the algorithms favor our videos and, eventually, the more money we will raise through YouTube advertisers. If you don't have a dime to give to the campaign, that YouTube subscription will go a long ways, too.
In exchange for some awesome perks, we're looking for some money to get the tour rolling down the road and to help fund low-income schools that can't afford to bring in outside programming.
Our initial goal for this campaign is $25k. This isn't enough to cover everything we hope to do, so we're also searching for a like-minded Title Sponsor. 

 
What You Get For Backing Our Campaign: Perks!
Not only will you be a member of our Troop, you can get any of our awesome perks, from a sticker to a weekend in the Tiny House. Here are a few that might need some clarification:
Stickers

We did a poll to see which sticker people liked the most. The results were highly inconclusive, some of both the Rectangular Bumper Sticker and the Oval Sticker.
(Note: The die-cut one in the picture was our original mock-up; people wanted it to say, ""I Am A Creative Animal"")


 
Tour T-Shirts

We've had a crazy amount of requests for T-shirts with Carl, our mascot. (He's cute, right?!) The time has come for us to send Carl out into the world on our Troop Members. He will keep your chest company on any size organic cotton tee you'd like.
Don't worry if you order one now and another later. We'll ask you for sizes at the end of the campaign and ship them where ever you'd like.


 
Original Artwork
Get an original work of art by wildlife artist and Tour Host Timothy Davison. These are one-of-a-kind originals created with oil paint on wood panels and framed by Tim himself using the most sustainable resource he could find: downed tree limbs from the forest right outside the Tiny House.
Polar Bear

This original work of art was created with oils on a wood panel and comes ready-to-hang in a custom built frame. This sustainable frame is travel ready and comes ready for the walls of your tiny house (or big house). 
Measurements are: Painting: 6"" x  12"" Including Frame: 10"" x  15.5""


Bullock's Oriole

This original work of art was created with oils on a wood panel and comes ready-to-hang in a custom built frame. This sustainable frame is travel ready and comes ready for the walls of your tiny house (or big house). 
You might recognize this fella from the video we made of our adventure in Dinosaur National Monument this last summer. These colorful birds are close relatives of the somewhat more famous, Baltimore Oriole.
Measurements are: Painting: 6"" x  12"" Including Frame: 9"" x  16""


Watch the video that inspired the painting here:


Wood Duck

This original work of art was created with oils on a wood panel and comes ready-to-hang in a custom built frame. This sustainable frame was made using wood from Indian Springs State Park in Georgia, some say, it is America's first State Park. 
The painting was inspired by a photo taken on the Homosassa River while Tim and Steph were in search of manatees in western Florida this winter. 
Measurements are: Painting: 6"" x  12"", plus frame.



 


 

 
 

 

Without Further Ado, Here's The Full List of Perks:
 

 
 
Know a Company That Could Be Title Sponsor?
We are looking for a like-minded sponsor who is excited to help a whole lot of people live more sustainably. In exchange for the a great marketing opportunity and a great tax write-off, we will be able to take our inspirational and educational message to schools and universities at no cost.However, we know we can only do so much in the brief time we spend at a given place.
That's where technology comes in. Real change happens when a student is reminded of our message a few weeks or a few months after our visit by seeing one of our YouTube videos, blogs, or other social media posts. They might change their major after watching a biologist who is saving the coral reefs, or get inspired by a student project that is protecting local wildlife, or learn how to save energy on a daily basis: 

 
What We Would Do with Title Sponsorship Funding:

Offer all educational presentations on The Creative Animal Tour for free, courtesy of our new Title Sponsor
Hire support staff: 
Video Editor: Tim and Steph can only do so much. With the help of an additional video editor, our team can produce much more educational video content, something to keep motivating the entire Troop.
Public Relations/Marketing: to maximize the reach of the tour, Tim and Steph would rather go to schools and film content rather than make phone calls and write emails to set up future tour stops. 


The sky is the limit: beyond the necessities, our team is willing to do any number of exciting ideas centered on the tour.
Scholarships/grants: We would love to help younger Creative Animals accomplish their goals and see their innovative ideas through to fruition.
Develop a Mobile App for The Troop: We have been approached by several groups who suggest that a mobile app is the best way to engage The Troop.
Etc...

<p><span>Hi everyone!</span></p>
<p><span>I’m writing today to tell you about an amazing opportunity I’ve found out about and would like to take part in.  This summer I would love to be able to go to Costa Rica on a volunteer trip run by a program called Global Leadership Adventures (GLA).  The trip I’d go on, titled “Saving the Pacific,” would take me to the Osa region of Costa Rica where I’d be working to prevent grey water - waste water produced from activities like laundry and dish washing - from flowing into the Pacific Ocean.  </span></p>
<p><span>The trip lasts a total of fourteen days, and the bulk of that time will be spent building biogardens that serve not only to eliminate grey water, but also to provide a beautiful landscape for the community.  I will also be serving on an ongoing project to locate waste problems in the community through geospatial technology and (hopefully) have the opportunity to help build recycling centers to further prevent harmful waste from entering into the ocean.  On top of all this I get to surf (my favorite sport), snorkel, and zip line through the jungle. </span></p>
<p><span>To do all these amazing things, though, I need to raise a total of about $4,000.  </span></p>
<p><span>To conclude: there are no words that fully express my excitement about this trip. I’ve only been out of the country a couple of times, and to fully immerse myself in a completely different culture would be incredible. </span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again for reading this! :)</span></p>

I am an Intuitive artist, Alternative Therapist and healer, living in the U.KI work with many groups of people from all kinds of backgrounds, belief systems to support their lives, dreams and projects, to inspire to motivate, and create new opportunities together. Couple of months ago I went to Peru for the first time, blending in with local people and the essence of the land, giving and receiving, also doing an energy & healing work with a wonderful group of Lightworkers. And the Land,The Pachamama is calling me back for my service and support again. The Mother Earth said "" Come back we are not finished yet, in fact we have just started!!"" What a fantastic invitation it was. However I wondered how I would be going back there ? This is how the invitation manifested itself. I have been received an invitation & chosen to go on such a wonderful & exciting journey, called ""Amazon Expedition and Avatar trainings"" organized by The Children Of The Sun's Foundation, our beloved Founder and Visionary Director, Tiara Kumara, to take place in Peru, Iquitos between April 13 - May 1, 2012. This is a once in a Life Time Opportunity for personal growth and transformation and also for Humanitarian Service. I am taking a part in the April group -group of 12-15 of us- and the participants who were chosen from around the word for this expedition will be undergoing such physical transformation, Jungle dieta, within the Heart of The Amazon, the rainforest as well as supporting the Indigenous people of the Amazon assisting them for building a hospital in their local area. During our time in the Amazon, we are hosted by ""CASA SHIPIBA"", a special Shipibo Indian family and their supporting pueblo village. We will be Living and Training with the Shipibo.The Shipibo are an indigenous people living along the banks and tributaries of the Amazon River. The Impact: GIVING BACK TO LIFE. The Life and the Spirit of The forest, Indigenous People ,who have been providing us the most vital part for our existence so unconditionally for centuries since the beginning of Life on this planet, now deserve more of our attention, contribution, support and Love. Rainforests are so vital and precious for our Planet, for us, for life. They are the source of Life which keeps us alive!! and we would not survive without them. Therefore every penny, no matter how small or big it is, will contribute tremendously to keep the rainforests and all its life alive. Since All life is interlinked and we are all connected to one an other, our personal experience and transformation will do a domino effect on all. On our return to our countries, we will transfer, transmit and share our experience, energy, knowledge ie the healing properties of plant medicine, healthier way of living to a wider reach, in our own areas and groups & family, networking this to all Lightworkers, healers, or to motivate one another just being a sample in our community. So this is a journey of ALL of us, for ALL of us in Oneness. Your contribution and support is very important and precious since you will be adding the light of the World, to the tapestry which you are part of. ""We receive as we give"" according to the Universal Law and what we give always comes back to us in a perfect way. I will be cutting from every and any possible other areas of my life and expenses to prioritise this no matter what, to make this happen and see my self there within the Jungle to return the favour, to Life, to The Great Mother Earth and all her Life with passion, enthusiasm and endless Joy. Would you support me on giving back to LIFE and be prepared to receive thousand times thousand fold ?  Fundraising & Support for the Indigenous people and their Global Vision: I am aiming to raise $1800. Each participant is charged with raising $1800 in support of this incredible humanitarian project. The cost and the donations will go towards all the expenses to build & maintain this ongoing program/project. *The funding & donations will help to bring the local people's global vision into reality.

For such a small team, our influence is reaching even the largest of manufacturers.</p><p>This is the blueprint for every bike we make, you guys will be riding the leading edge of technology, this kind of bike has only been in the hands of the elite; <i>now it's available to you</i>.</p><p>We wanted to prove we could make an affordable, progressive bike in the UK, by working leaner and shipping direct to the customer, we make this superbike fantasy an affordable reality.</p><p>In the longterm this would secure manufacturing in the UK. </p><p> </p><p>If you would like more technical details and geometry, skip to the bottom. </p><p> </p><p><i><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></i></p><p>As a collective, we are very risk adverse, we don't have any investors, bank loans or shareholders, so we are making for our audience, no one else.</p><p>That's meant we have become very good at identifying risks and weighing them up.</p><p>We have lots of friends who own larger bike companies, their connections and guidance have been instrumental in making sure we protect ourselves against risk. Should we have problems with raw materials, machining and fabrication? Then we have a list of mentors who will be able to step in to carry this over the line.</p><p>This frame was designed to be straightforward to fabricate, we have made far more challenging products using more unpredictable processes. We have the CNC routines production ready and material on stock to make the frames. If some unforeseen circumstance happens, we would have a multitude of options and suppliers to fall back on. </p><p> </p><p><i><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></i></p><p>Of course not everyone can drop that amount of money on a frame. Like us and want to help?</p><p><strong>Grab one of our smaller perks. </strong></p><p>It adds up fast!</p><p><strong>Share this on your social media or even tell a friend in real life!</strong></p><p>You wouldn't believe how much reach we get if people like, share and comment. Its all spreading the word. We are always so happy to see people rocking our stuff. </p><p><i>Thanks for just stopping by!</i></p><p><strong>Deep Tech.</strong></p><p>For those who want to delve deeper.</p><p> </p><p><strong>F.A.S.T™ -</strong></p><p>Fu*kin Active Single-Pivot Technology.</p><p> </p><p>Our first prototypes had an array of complex linkages, and while the performance was marginally improved, we found with a high and active single pivot, you got rid of a lot of complex things to get damaged, a lot of needless bearings to service, the bane of every bike shop. So we focussed on a single row of oversized bearings doing the brunt of the work, but we also use needle bearings in the shock mounts to reduce breakaway force. And our isolated chain tension means no pedal / suspension conflict. This leads to an active rear suspension system geared for gravity. And we've all seen those recent world cup runs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>180/180 Optimised.</strong></p><p> </p><p>Next generation of Forks and Shocks now allow usable and reliable long travel options that blurs the line between a mountain bike and a pure downhill bike. On the fly climb switch means, whilst climbing this will never be a pleasure, you can climb to places few long travel bikes can reach.</p><p>If you think all that travel is excessive, so do we! But if you want to be the first person to carve a new trail or hit that drop. This will have your back. And its only 20mm more than a 160mm.</p><p> </p><p><strong>29”</strong></p><p> </p><p>For fast rolling and super monster trucking feel, nothing beats 29r wheels.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Silence is golden</strong></p><p> </p><p>No mech, no chain devices, no chain slap, no losing a chain... Ever! Perfect chain alignment, silent freehub. Focus on your run, not the clatter of your bike, become zen in the most challenging moments.</p><p>Every part of the frame is engineered to allow sniper levels of concentration.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Gearbox.</strong></p><p>For something so complex to engineer, for the rider, a gearbox means a choice of 9-18 gears over an insanely wide ratio, A low centre of gravity and moving all that weight off your rear hub, and between your feet, which, actually adds to stability and traction. Go on, pick up even the fanciest of the fancy carbon rim, luxury hub wheel, and the most exotic 12spd cassette. That dinner plate size ring makes for a heavy and unstable mass right where you don't want it on a full suspension bike. Not only that but you can run a more sturdy singlepeed chain. Oh and servicing intervals of ten thousand miles per oil change. This bike is always ready when you are.</p><p> </p><p><strong>It's bullet time.</strong></p><p>If you've not ridden an advanced geometry bike, you are in for an experience. Longer top tube, shorter stem, slacker head angle, steeper seat tube and lower centre of gravity. What does all this jargon add up to? A bike that feels that you are in it, not on it. Most test riders get the same feeling, that the bike feels like its slowing time down, more reaction time and more focus but faster times. Stability is the key. Without a twitchy front end you have less calculations to make, you can stay on line easier and hit speeds you never thought possible.

We need to invest in packaging and tooling as well as raw materials. If we overfund we will start full production, right here in the UK, and maybe even in the USA too to save on transportation as we already sell a quarter of our products to the USA and Canada.Aside from the frame kit. We have custom artwork, blueprints, garments and more. We're also offering a few experiences that you'll enjoy (and so will we!)IF we don't get full funding, our primary focus will be to fulfil our backers. Should we not be able to, we will offer an alternative product or refund. We are already an established business, we will look after you.What do you get if I pledge for the frame?SLEIPNIR 180 travel front and rear. Hand fabricated in the UK. This thing is special.   The ImpactWe believe this will be our first full production bike. We have made over 300 frames over 10 different hardtail and full suspension designs, on top of 25 different prototype frame designs spanning several materials from humble steel to exotic titanium and carbon hybrids (Google ""Sick Bikes Have Blue""). Some of our previous bikesHave Blue (Titanium / Carbon hybrid) 4140 Wülf Gnarcissist Luxe Titanium (Very special edition) Gnarcissist Luxe Titanium Hellhammer (27.5"" DJ prototype) DFA (Death From Above) Titanium FS Super bike We believe the future of mountain bikes is gearbox based.Our team has pushed geometry and long travel 29” platforms to the forefront of the industry. For such a small team, our influence is reaching even the largest of manufacturers.This is the blueprint for every bike we make, you guys will be riding the leading edge of technology, this kind of bike has only been in the hands of the elite; now it's available to you.We wanted to prove we could make an affordable, progressive bike in the UK, by working leaner and shipping direct to the customer, we make this superbike fantasy an affordable reality.In the longterm this would secure manufacturing in the UK.  If you would like more technical details and geometry, skip to the bottom.  Risks & ChallengesAs a collective, we are very risk adverse, we don't have any investors, bank loans or shareholders, so we are making for our audience, no one else.That's meant we have become very good at identifying risks and weighing them up.We have lots of friends who own larger bike companies, their connections and guidance have been instrumental in making sure we protect ourselves against risk. Should we have problems with raw materials, machining and fabrication? Then we have a list of mentors who will be able to step in to carry this over the line.This frame was designed to be straightforward to fabricate, we have made far more challenging products using more unpredictable processes. We have the CNC routines production ready and material on stock to make the frames. If some unforeseen circumstance happens, we would have a multitude of options and suppliers to fall back on.  Other Ways You Can HelpOf course not everyone can drop that amount of money on a frame. Like us and want to help?Grab one of our smaller perks. It adds up fast!Share this on your social media or even tell a friend in real life!You wouldn't believe how much reach we get if people like, share and comment. Its all spreading the word. We are always so happy to see people rocking our stuff. Thanks for just stopping by!Deep Tech.For those who want to delve deeper. F.A.S.T™ -Fu*kin Active Single-Pivot Technology. Our first prototypes had an array of complex linkages, and while the performance was marginally improved, we found with a high and active single pivot, you got rid of a lot of complex things to get damaged, a lot of needless bearings to service, the bane of every bike shop. So we focussed on a single row of oversized bearings doing the brunt of the work, but we also use needle bearings in the shock mounts to reduce breakaway force. And our isolated chain tension means no pedal / suspension conflict. This leads to an active rear suspension system geared for gravity. And we've all seen those recent world cup runs.  180/180 Optimised. Next generation of Forks and Shocks now allow usable and reliable long travel options that blurs the line between a mountain bike and a pure downhill bike. On the fly climb switch means, whilst climbing this will never be a pleasure, you can climb to places few long travel bikes can reach.If you think all that travel is excessive, so do we! But if you want to be the first person to carve a new trail or hit that drop. This will have your back. And its only 20mm more than a 160mm. 29” For fast rolling and super monster trucking feel, nothing beats 29r wheels. Silence is golden No mech, no chain devices, no chain slap, no losing a chain... Ever! Perfect chain alignment, silent freehub. Focus on your run, not the clatter of your bike, become zen in the most challenging moments.Every part of the frame is engineered to allow sniper levels of concentration. Gearbox.For something so complex to engineer, for the rider, a gearbox means a choice of 9-18 gears over an insanely wide ratio, A low centre of gravity and moving all that weight off your rear hub, and between your feet, which, actually adds to stability and traction. Go on, pick up even the fanciest of the fancy carbon rim, luxury hub wheel, and the most exotic 12spd cassette. That dinner plate size ring makes for a heavy and unstable mass right where you don't want it on a full suspension bike. Not only that but you can run a more sturdy singlepeed chain. Oh and servicing intervals of ten thousand miles per oil change. This bike is always ready when you are. It's bullet time.If you've not ridden an advanced geometry bike, you are in for an experience. Longer top tube, shorter stem, slacker head angle, steeper seat tube and lower centre of gravity. What does all this jargon add up to? A bike that feels that you are in it, not on it. Most test riders get the same feeling, that the bike feels like its slowing time down, more reaction time and more focus but faster times. Stability is the key. Without a twitchy front end you have less calculations to make, you can stay on line easier and hit speeds you never thought possible. In the air the bike is balanced with the rider leading to predictable take offs and landings. You can pick a line through root or rock gardens rather than just hitting and hopeing.  Future Proofing. There was no point in building a bike that would become obsolete. We took onboard lots of real world rider concerns. No weird standards. ZS tapered headset, 31.6mm Dropper post, 142 Singlepeed hub (SS doesn't need boost as flanges are wide spaced), Post mount Disc. All these standards we expect not to change anytime soon. Off the shelf bearings and fixtures. We designed every part of the frame with simplicity in mind. The bearings and bolts found on the bike are common sizes and are all easily and affordably obtained.  Replaceable dropouts.Not only good for damage control in the event of a bad accident. These replaceable dropouts allow future adjustment to the near endless wacky wheel standards the bike industry is so keen on. They hold our rear disc so if that changed in size or offset we'll be able to design a fix. You can even get modified versions if you have an unusual hub, like DH singlespeed / boost etc. Open Source parts.We will host the files, free to use, needed to create a replacement idler transfer ring, dropouts etc. You can buy replacement parts,from us, or any 3rd party that makes them, or make them yourself if you are handy**. What if Pinion gearbox goes obsolete before frame does? We chose the Pinion™ floorplan because we believe that the company is stable enough to continue growth and will last the life of the frame. Should in the very distant future the unthinkable happen. There is a plan B. We will generate a cradle )or more likely hassle Olsen bikes in to sharing theirs with us) to replace the Pinion gearbox with BB73. And this is where the replaceable dropouts come in. The frame will be designed to maintain, albeit suboptimal use, with a rear mech and cassette.   Warranty & Testing 5 year manufacturers defect warranty with reasonable crash replacement costs.Tested in the UK to meet and greatly exceed BS EN ISO 4210 Parts 1 to 9 ** We are not responsible if your 3rd party or homemade part snaps.

Once up-and-running, 'Trace My Hoodie' will allow any customer, via a QR code, to instantly see all of the people who made their hoodie, right from the cotton farmers to the seamstresses (See Toms Shoes' example)
Follow my journey this summer as I travel to the true 'coalface' of Fairtrade, and find out whether Fairtrade really makes a difference in the Developing World.The Details.
5 week journey across India, from 22 February to 1 April 2014
Visiting and documenting Liminal Apparel's entire Fairtrade Organic supply chain across India
Researching and creating NZ's first 'Traceable Fashion Garment', a Liminal Apparel hoodie
All funds raised, however much, will go to meeting the travel costs of the trip
Impact of the Trip.

Auditing one of New Zealand's premiere Fairtrade Organic clothing brands

<strong>Our Story</strong> </h3>
<p>Heartbreaks are not always bad! </p>
<p> Two years ago, I was going through a crushing heartbreak, when I was a college student looking for the American dream that was going to dental school at that time. </p>
<p>Things were not going to get any harder for me at that moment!</p>
<p>As an immigrant student, living alone on the other side of the world and having been emotionally vulnerable for a while, I realized I wanted a fresh start. I knew there was something I had to do for myself to get back on my feet better than ever before.</p>
<p>So one day a friend of mine invited me to a backpacking trip, and I went. I had never been on a camping or backpacking trip and I did not have any gear, nothing. Not even a backpack! I used my college backpack to pack a couple of items I've just had and hit the road. A normal person would think about buying the gear before the trip, but at the time, as a student I couldn't afford any gear. </p>
<p>I just went on the trip and I had a BLAST. It was one of my happiest two days of life spent in the woods. We swam in the lake, set fire, sang and danced under the stars.</p>
<p>No doubt I froze to death at night because I didn't have the right gear and I had a super uncomfortable sleep but the joy was to resolve all the discomfort. </p>
<p> After that first trip, I knew I have found my element. I started  borrowing my friend Ashkan gear and kept going on backpacking trips. The more I spent time in nature, the more peace I felt within myself. I started to feel happier and more content. I tend to lean toward enjoying life and even relishing every hurdle that comes with it. Nature has been the best therapy I could ever ask for!</p>
<p>As Albert Einstein says ""<i> Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better.""</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The joy was overwhelmingly beyond words that I wanted others to feel it too. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As much as I wanted to take everyone with me to an adventurous night out in the woods, I couldn't persuade people to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars to buy the gear.</p>
<p>Backpacking gear is very costly.  One sleeping bag could cost $500 or a backpack could get $300 out of your wallet. And these are just the basic stuff!! Pro backpackers know this well; it is the <i>Right Gear</i> that makes the journey easier and more enjoyable. Even if you are going to the most beautiful place in the world but your shoes kill you or your backpack isn't the right one for you and it gives you a bad  backpain,  you're not going to enjoy your trip much. Most likely, you might even hate it. But  who hates a nice night out sitting around the fire  toasting  marshmallows and sleeping under the sky, counting the stars?! Yeah, no one.</p>
<p> </p> <p>So we decided to make a platform that is capable of connecting people who are looking for gear to those who have those gear in their own neighborhood and community. (Both individuals and stores could be suppliers) </p> <p>Hi. We are Neda &amp; Reza, <i><strong>Share Adventure and Gear</strong></i> team and we are excited to tell you about our platform SAAG.</p> <p> Our mission is to build a cloud-based outdoor gear supply company with a national reputation for stress-free accessibility to items at a lower cost with wider variety and outstanding customer service. So next time you decide to go explore nature but you don’t have a gear or two or you do not have any gear at all, do not worry!  We got you covered!</p>
<p>We have named our company SAAG ”Share Adventure And Gear'' because all we want to do is to make it possible for all the outdoor lovers around the world to connect and be able to share their adventures and gear.  SAAG is looking to make outdoor experience easier and more affordable for everyone so that all can enjoy being outdoors without having to worry about the cost nor the space that it takes to store the gear. </p>
<p>We recognize that the best part of any adventure is the people you meet along the way. It is our goal to make using and owning outdoor equipment more affordable by bringing people together. Our platform is a community marketplace where members can rent and/or lend their outdoor gear to those in their community.

<p>Well, we couldn’t get the idea out of our heads, and within a few months, we had a tech pack and initial prototype ready to roll! However, in early 2017 our world came to a screeching halt when our dad, Jeffrey Allen Green, passed away unexpectedly in a tragic plane crash.</p>
<p>After a period of mourning, we came back more determined than ever to make Cache and the Basecamp system a reality in order to bring our father’s idea to life and honor his legacy. After years of work finalizing the design and materials, attaining a utility patent-pending status, and partnering with a trusted factory, we are finally ready to go live and bring Cache and our products to the world!</p>

We're sure most of you know at least one of us: Josh is familiar because of his time playing at The Ohio State University, and more recently volunteering for USQ.  He ran Gameplay for US World Cup 8 in addition to four Regional Championships. A lot of you know Alex from various quidditch avenues, as a referee, as a player who travels the country, and as the current Great Lakes Regional Coordinator.

We can't wait to do our bit to help make this the best, most international tournament ever. </p><p>BUT (and you probably knew this but was coming) we all have already invested quite a lot in school and quidditch and do not have enough in our respective budgets to completely fund our trips to Europe. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>What it's going to cost us</b></p><p></p><p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>Josh</i></p><p>Because of my work and geographical situation, I am stuck in terms of possible dates and airports, so my flight costs will be much higher.

We're sure most of you know at least one of us: Josh is familiar because of his time playing at The Ohio State University, and more recently volunteering for USQ.  He ran Gameplay for US World Cup 8 in addition to four Regional Championships. A lot of you know Alex from various quidditch avenues, as a referee, as a player who travels the country, and as the current Great Lakes Regional Coordinator. And many of you would have met Bex over the last year, when she lived in Europe and ended up involved in EQC, European Games, and Quidditch Europe, or from her 3 years coaching at uOttawa. While none of us are Jedis, reformed Stormtroopers, or adorable robots, we are all on the organizing committee for the 2016 Quidditch World Cup and are SO STOKED ABOUT IT - Josh is Gameplay, Alex is Marketing, and Rebecca is Logistics. And, to make this tournament happen, Josh will be as trustworthy as Finn (once he made the decision to roll with the Resistance anyways), Alex will be as tech-savvy as BB-8, and Rebecca will be as passionate as Rey. We can't wait to do our bit to help make this the best, most international tournament ever. BUT (and you probably knew this but was coming) we all have already invested quite a lot in school and quidditch and do not have enough in our respective budgets to completely fund our trips to Europe. What it's going to cost usJoshBecause of my work and geographical situation, I am stuck in terms of possible dates and airports, so my flight costs will be much higher. As a result I am not actively looking to fill my full travel costs. To fly from Columbus, OH to Frankfurt will cost roughly $1,800USD. I am only looking for $1,000USD and will be paying the rest out of pocket as a courtesy to potential givers (though if we exceed our goal I will gladly accept it!).AlexFor my trip to Germany, I plan to fly out of Boston, Massachusetts directly into Frankfurt.   As of right now, my cost is looking at about $900USD. With this being my second trip to Germany, I already know what unique and interesting items people might want from this beautiful country, and I am more than prepared to make this happen for you with your generous donations. I will be trying to fund all housing and food out of pocket, and I will use any extra funding to aid my travel companions for this amazing tournament. RebeccaThe money I would need to get to Frankfurt (all ballpark costs because flight prices do tend to fluctuate):$880CAD/$620USD to fly from Winnipeg to London (return)$150CAD/$106USD to get from London to Frankfurt (return) (the cheapest option I've found is flying into Frankfurt Hahn or Luxembourg, and then a bus... but suggestions for cheaper options are welcome!)for a total of $1030CAD/$726USD. I'm planning on covering transportation and food while I'm over there, since I'd be paying for food anyways, and will be pretty much counting on couches for accommodation... I will bring gifts of maple candies and can make you chocolate chip cookies in exchange! What we need from youWe're hoping to raise $3000USD. The money will cover Alex and Rebecca's travel costs, and the Josh will get the remainder - as you read above, we're all travelling from different places and as such our trip costs will be different.  Head on over to the right to pick the perk you want, or if you can think of something else you'd like for a reasonable donation, just drop us a line and we can chat! If you're dying for delivery of something from Canada or the US, or want poorly rewritten song lyrics, or a ridiculous short story... we can make those things happen.If you can't donate then please share this! Even if you don't want any of these perks, maybe your friend is a TD and needs a gameplay spreadsheet, or your coach would like to discuss drills... let them know and help the volunteers of the tournament committee get to World Cup. We hope we'll get to see you all in Frankfurt this summer!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3> Nikki's Trip to Nicaragua </h3>
<p>My name is Nicole Harte. I am a recent graduate from the University of South Carolina with a degree in Spanish language and cultures. I want to live like Jesus, and have always had a strong desire to give life and hope to the poor and needy. I desperately want to pour out my life into helping people see God's love.  </p>
<p>God has set before me the opportunity to travel to Nicaragua this summer with the Charleston Church of Christ to serve in impoverished areas of the country. I will be living in a small town called Malpaisillo for five weeks with a local family. The main purpose of my stay will be to serve in the Nicaragua Job Development Project, an initiative started by the Charleston Church of Christ to help build local businesses and create jobs in Malpaisillo. Malpaisillo is an impoverished town in the Leon district of Nicaragua. During my stay, I will also be teaching English classes and helping to serve the local church in Malpaisillo.</p>
<p>The suffereing, poverty, and oppression that we see in the world today is not ignored by God; he hears every cry from his children. God has chosen to respond to the hurt in the world, not with a magical snap of his fingers, but instead by working through us to heal and repair what is broken. I believe that God uses us, human beings, to be vessels of His love and healing in this world. I think God's love is shown in a powerful way when we choose to pour ourselves out for others. This is what I hope to do with my time in Nicaragua.   </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Where the $$$ goes</strong></p>
<p>My fundraising goal for this campaign is $1000. The actual cost of the trip is slightly more than this amount, but I am personally funding the remainder of the trip.</p>
<p>The cost of the trip includes airfare, travel within the country, rent for the family I will be staying with, food expenses, and vaccinations. </p>
<p>Any funds raised above my goal will be used directly for the Nicaragua Job development Project. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every contribution goes a long way!</p>
<p>Last summer a large group from the Charleston Church of Christ traveled to Malpaisillo with the heart to build and serve. They started an initiative called the Nicaragua Job Development Project to create jobs and income for locals in the town. Their main project was building a bakery/cafe (the only one in this impoverished town!) which could employ and provide for multiple families. This summer, we will be returning to continue the work which was started. We will also be helping a woman in the town to build her own clothing store. </p>
<p>While in Malpaisilllo, we will also be teaching English classes for both adults and children, as well as painting local houses and helping install concrete floors into homes which currently have dirt floors.   <br/><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I fully understand that many of you will not be able to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help! Here are some other ways you can support my trip:</p>
<p><br/>First and foremost, PRAY! I can use all the prayers that I can get =]</p>

<p>Let's face it, journaling has a bum rap.  Which is too bad because not everyone who journals is a 12-year-old girl with a heart-wrenching pre-teen crush (poor girl).</p>

<p>We've been making apps for over five years.  We are a small and dedicated team out to make stuff that matters.  Unlike the big guns - the large software companies - we don't have floors on floors on floors of developers and venture capital in the bank.  What we do have, though, we believe is much more important.  We have a strong and growing community of iPhone &amp; iPad users who believe in the work we're doing and love the stuff we make for them.</p>
<p>Our apps have been used over 40 million times, but none of them can hold a candle to the difficulty of creating Journo.  At this point we have an early alpha version, which means we're about 75% there, and it's the last 25% that's most challenging.  BUT it's not only this last bit that we need your help with...</p>
<p>More than just development, we need your help in changing lives.  Maybe that's yours, or maybe that's someone you think might need Journo.  We believe that Journo tracks and <i>encourages</i> users to live a more fulfilling life and we want as many people as possible to get involved and get living the life that is true to them.</p>
<p>That's why our perks are so extremely low priced for what you get... we want as many users as possible to benefit from this and through IndieGoGo, we can accomplish this together.</p>

<p>While most IndieGoGo campaigns launch with a concept or prototype, we feel that most of the risk in our project has already been cut by having moved far beyond that stage to an alpha version of Journo for iOS iPhones &amp; iPads, by our incredible and deeply experienced team.</p>
<p>This isn't our first rodeo.  We've successfully launched over 40 applications for The App Store.  We've built the #1 Entertainment app in the United States, as well as a few other top Apple Picks.  Our apps have been used over 40 million times and we're happy to say that none of which are as sweet as this one!  So this is the only project we are running, and has the undivided attention of our team.</p>
<p>Launch Timing: With any software development, there are potential risks in unforeseen variables causing delays in launch. While this is always a possibility, we don't expect this to play a significant role given the stage we're at. We have already made a tremendously detailed effort to create a streamlined and extremely reliable application. </p>
<p>We feel confident that we could launch Journo for Apple devices shortly after the conclusion of our IndieGoGo campaign. </p>
<p>We will keep our backers up to date with our progress and let you know if we encounter any setbacks.</p>

<p>Not yet.  But if we meet our initial goal, then we're off to the races for the Android Stretch Goal!  We hit that, and we'll go Android!</p>
<p><b>2) Is there a data limit?  A limit on the amount of pics &amp; videos I can upload?</b></p>
<p>Nope!  The reason we have subscriptions is to cover all of our server costs, which can add up when users add lots of content.  But that's what we're here for!  Add everything you can!  We'll NEVER limit you on this.</p>
<p><b>3) How are you different from the other journaling apps out there?</b></p>
<p>Oh wow, glad you asked this because we are VERY different from what else is available.  For one thing, we allow you to share your journos with friends or family.  This way you can collaborate on the memories!  We also have tailored journos - you know, different folks different strokes.  How about our mapping feature?  Ever seen that before?  We didn't think so and we worked extremely hard to make this work perfectly and LOOK amazing too (we've even give you multiple design options!).  Then there is the printing aspect too.  We've made it easy to fill up your journos, and then we've given you the option to print them too.  Want a gorgeous coffee table book from that last adventure?  No problem.  The list goes on and on (with more to come!).</p>
<p><b>4) Could I ever lose my data?  How do I know it's safe and sound?</b></p>
<p>No worries here because all of your data is totally encrypted on our servers and backed up to a secure cloud.  It's yours forever, and no one but you can access it.</p>
<p><b>5) Is there a page limit for printing my Journo?</b></p>
<p>We had to cap the page at 30 pages for the campaign, but don't worry because additional pages are inexpensive and you can easily add them at the time of printing.</p>

Let's face it, journaling has a bum rap.  Which is too bad because not everyone who journals is a 12-year-old girl with a heart-wrenching pre-teen crush (poor girl).
We're here to change that.  Journaling might not be for everyone but great things rarely are.  Journo, though, is for us, and hopefully you.
We've created the most sophisticated journaling app available, but that's only part of the equation.
The magic lies in what happens to your life when you use it.
As you read this, you're probably not in the midst of a life crisis, but maybe deep down you know you were made for more.  No matter the place you're in, it's never too late to start writing the story you were made to live.

And that's why we're here - to give you a blank canvas, a blank page and to urge you to start (now?) because otherwise time will fly by and you’ll still be left with the same blank canvas, the same blank page, and a life full of regret.

So, what kind of life do you want live?  Not for your parents, not for your friends, not for anybody but you.
What words do you want to fill these pages?  What pictures and videos do you want to fill this canvas?  Again:
What’s your story?
Journo is here to help you fall more and more in love with your life.  To get you waking up everyday excited for what’s in store.  To encourage you to live an adventure.  So let’s burn your couch and do just that!  






1 - Travel Maps.  Have an adventure lined up?  Wouldn't it be sweet to view your route?  Wouldn't it be even sweeter to view it on a custom designed map you can only find in Journo?  Well then we've got you covered.  Check out your current options:





2 - Text Schmext.  One of the biggest reasons we wanted to create this is because buying a paper journal is cool, but extremely limited.  I was anchored in a gorgeous and secluded bay in The Bahamas, watching a strikingly red sunrise and not able to add a picture of it to my paper journal.  That needed to be changed.  So we took care of it.  Seamlessly add as many pictures or videos as you want... for those moments when words just don't cut it!  Take a gander:



3 - Not Just Digital.  Remember how I just said ""a paper journal is cool""?  They certainly are - to look at!  But hauling one around, with all it's limitations, isn't so cool.  We got you covered here as well and made it as easy as pie to print your Journos directly from the app.  We lay them out and let you alter and edit to your liking (fonts, colors, pics, placement, etc).  Then just print!  It's the best of both worlds and only Journo does it.  Check out the beautiful finished product here:






4 - Collaborate!  Never before has there been a way for two people to contribute to the same journal.  We're pretty jacked up about this.  You and the hubby want to journal about all the funny things your kid is doing?  No problem.  Heading out on a road trip with a pal and want to collaborate on the same journo to maximize the memories?  No problem.  The options are endless.  Here's how it works:



5 - Tailored Journos.  We've customized a few different journos to suit your needs: a daily gratitude journo, project journo and travel journo.  All of which have a few different features that fit nicely within that theme.  Use one, use them all.  Unlimited journos with your subscription.  Take a look:



BONUS 6, 7, 8... - Safe, Secure, Cross-Device, Etc.  Your privacy is priority numero uno, so no worries there because your journos are locked up tight and only available to you (on any of your devices you're logged in to).














Thanks to all our amazing early adopters, we've hit our initial goal.  But let's not stop now!
We're unlocking an Android version of Journo for just $10,800!  Here's the details:

ALL perks below stay the same, but use the app on your Android device instead.
Will work on Android tablets too!
Unlike our August iOS launch, we don't expect to have the Android version ready until fall (but we'll make sure it's worth the wait!).

Welcome aboard Android people.  We're psyched to have you, and can't wait to hear about the awesome life stories you write with Journo!

It’s equipped with the leading ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistant System) tech that boosts your driving safety. When the vehicle is parked, the parking mode will monitor the car’s surroundings and automatically start recording if any collision is detected. Recordings are stored locally and can be viewed in-app for on-site download and instant sharing. Shipping StartsNote: If you want to add the hardware kit or another set of A800 to your perk, please check the add-on list after you choose the perk.      Also, you can check our latest review videos from YouTube:




 

 Up to 4K Resolution with 140°FOVBuilt around a powerful Sony IMX 415 CMOS image sensor, the A800 dash cam records 4K UHD videos with a wide-angle 140° FOV. Combined the optional rear cam*, every important detail in the front or rear of the vehicle can be recorded clearly to provide irrefutable video evidence or capture the landscape along your journey with cinema-quality video.*In front-vision recording mode, the max resolution is 3840*2160. In dual-vision recording mode, the max resolution for front and rear view will be 2560*1600 and 1920*1080 respectively.Since we have hit the 600K goal, our second stretch goal is unlocked - A800 front dash cam's resolution in dual-vision is upgraded to 4K now! For details, please check our updates. Super Night Vision with 3D DNRThe A800 achieves stunning video and vivid, clear images even in low-light conditions using a 3D DNR (Dynamic Noise Reduction) tech, F/1.8 aperture lens and a smart algorithm that significantly reduces image noise and automatically adjusts the exposure balance. The result is enhanced night vision with greater details. 3-inch HD Display Screen & One-button SwitchView your car’s surroundings easily on A800’s 3” high definition screen. With a simple press, you can easily switch between the front and the rear views.  The A800 is more than just a reliable dash cam. When you start the car, A800 automatically begins recording and enables the ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance System) that will assist you while driving with lane-departure and forward collision warnings that help you avoid accidents. Lane-departure Warning (LDW) SystemThe Lane Departure Warning (LDW) system uses the A800 camera to monitor the lane markings to make sure the car remains safely in the lane of travel. In case you are distracted and begin to drift, the LDW system uses and audio alarm to warn you, for a safe driving every day! Forward-collision Warning (FCW) SystemA800 also includes an advanced Forward-collision Warning system that automatically monitors the car driving in front of you. If the vehicles get too close, too quickly, for instance in the case of a sudden stop by the leading car, A800 will warn you with an audible alarm. This system is especially useful in the stop-and-go traffic during busy commute times.    With A800 4k dash cam, the protection doesn’t stop when you leave your car. After parking, the Parking Mode* is automatically activated. Using a 3-axis gravity sensor, A800 can detect any hit-and-run collision and immediately begin recording to capture valuable video evidence.*For this feature, we highly recommend you install the A800 using the optional 70mai hardware kit. This allows connection to the car’s fused power source to ensure power during long-recording sessions when the car is parked.When you return to the car after a Parking Mode incident, A800 will remind you to check the event recordings in-app.  A800 also acts as an accurate trip computer, storing data that includes mileage, range, average speed, max speed, duration and more that can be viewed conveniently in-app. It’s great for long trips and to record the exact location of an accident if one should occur.  The A800 records video on a loop and stores it locally on a Micro SD memory card (up to 128GB supported) while driving. This ensures that in the event of an accident, the video evidence will be captured and then safely secured from overwriting. To check video at any time, simply open the App to playback or download the videos free of charge.  No network is necessary to connect your smartphone with A800. It seamlessly connects using its own Wi-Fi for full instant access to stored videos. The dash cam also acts as a digital camera, controlled with your phone to capture any picture or view along your route. Share memories of every special road trip fast and easy online!    Installation is super easy. Because it requires no special wiring, the A800 can be installed in minutes. Simply attach to windscreen, connect to power at the vehicles 12v power point, download the 70mai app and connect with your smartphone using built-in Wi-Fi. Now your car is protected by an ever vigilant 24/7 guard!     Note: If you want to add the hardware kit to your perk, please check the add-on list after you choose your perk.            70mai is a team of innovators focused on intelligent in-car electronics that add convenience to travel and safety to the driving experience.

<p>Bird songs, unlike recorded music, are living sounds with complex variations of speeds and cadences.

<p>Not only is Warblr helping to crack the code of bird calls and linguistics more generally, it's also contributing to data collection about bird distribution and migration. Each time the app is used to identify a bird, in-the-app geo-tracking is used to map which species are being identified when and where. These data are publicly available, allowing zoologists and ecologists to monitor species growth and decline, patterns of migration, and ultimately to aid conservation.</p>
<h3>Warblr in the US</h3>
<p>The next big test for Team Warblr is to 'teach' it species of North America, region by region, starting in Georgia. Like trees, flowers, fish, etc., certain bird species are native to particular regions, but two factors make birds especially tricky to identify - 1) many migrate, and 2) they develop regional 'accents'.  North America is a huge land mass with several hundreds of bird species that represent <i>many many</i> more bird calls. Through the Georgia pilot, we will learn more about how bird calls vary region to region, and design a scaling plan to bring the app to all states pretty quickly.</p>

This covers the cost of replicating the database, server set-up and maintenance, app design and development, and the content necessary to 'teach' the system about bird species native to Georgia.</p>
<p>We will build two versions of the smartphone application – a regular version for download ($4.99), and a student version. The student version will be made available to schools free of charge, in conjunction with activities and lessons developed by Atlanta Audubon Society and Captain Planet Foundation.</p>
<p>In some ways, Warblr remains an experiment. Using deep machine technology to <i>accurately</i> identify bird calls across a region as large as North America is the ideal outcome of several factors – understanding of regional variability of calls, availability of appropriate data, sufficient 'training' of the system, ability to overcome challenges such as mimicry of calls (by birds and humans!) The rate and cost of scaling will depend on what we find in pilot testing in Georgia, but we are confident that we have the right team in place to overcome any challenges we encounter. If we exceed our goal, funds will go into the next stage of development so we can make the app available to a broader geographic region.</p>

Bringing Warblr to North America (starting in Georgia), and making it available free to classrooms requires an initial $16,000 initial investment. This covers the cost of replicating the database, server set-up and maintenance, app design and development, and the content necessary to 'teach' the system about bird species native to Georgia.
We will build two versions of the smartphone application – a regular version for download ($4.99), and a student version. The student version will be made available to schools free of charge, in conjunction with activities and lessons developed by Atlanta Audubon Society and Captain Planet Foundation.
In some ways, Warblr remains an experiment. Using deep machine technology to accurately identify bird calls across a region as large as North America is the ideal outcome of several factors – understanding of regional variability of calls, availability of appropriate data, sufficient 'training' of the system, ability to overcome challenges such as mimicry of calls (by birds and humans!) The rate and cost of scaling will depend on what we find in pilot testing in Georgia, but we are confident that we have the right team in place to overcome any challenges we encounter. If we exceed our goal, funds will go into the next stage of development so we can make the app available to a broader geographic region.

After around $4,000 of repairs, I realized $500 vans aren’t the best investments. But the van must live on, and with your help it will, and hopefully the midsboys won’t die in their second cross-country voyage.  Exhibit A:  The FrameNew England isn’t very kind to cars, and Mother Gaia has fully unleashed her wrath on the van.  As you can see, the van got a couple holes in its frame; hopefully we can raise enough money to have the frame reinforced or repaired.Exhibit B:  The Leaf Spring MountThe Leaf Springs are the back of the van’s suspension. Similar to the frame, its got a little rust on it and one of the mounting brackets. Right now the weight of the van and that little bolt is keeping the van from breaking when it goes over bumps (we’re planning on hitting and running over as many elks as we can to avenge Nate Ryan For reference:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y14FzUXgl3c). Repairing the frame, the leaf spring, and its connection to the van is imperative to being able to take this trip. While we are all about the YOLO lifestyle, all that rust is pretty sketchy.What We NeedWe're raising funds to repair and outfit the Midsvan for an extended road trip which would include:
Repairing the frame and leaf spring
Gas/Van upkeep on the road
4G or Satellite Internet for the van and live broadcast our adventures where available.
Sleeping arrangements (Camping equipment and the occasional seedy motel)
“Safety” Precautions and Equipment
Video equipment to help document the trip
THE PERKS:To help fund this trip we are offering a plethora of incentives ranging from MIDS apparel to custom decks.All perks will be special edition products only available through the indiegogo campaign.10$ Sticker pack15$ Patch and sticker pack25$ Unique printed photo from the trip, to redeem after the trip is completed.  25$ Full length DVD of the trip40$ Shirt, patch and stickers swag pack50$ Shirt, stickers + post cards from every major stop with some loving words from the whole team.75$ Special edition MIDS double kick deck100$ Swag pack 1: MIDS DK+ shirt, stickers and patch160$ Custom MIDS DH deck185$ Swag pack 2: MIDS DH deck + shirt, stickers and patch250$ Super swag pack: Both MIDS decks, shirt, stickers and patch + post cards from every major stop with some loving words from the whole team.500$ We will put you name or something of choice on the van, you supply decal or stencil + shirt, stickers, patch and post cards from every major stop with some loving words from the whole team.500$ Producer rights (early edit sneak peeks and input, feedback appreciated) and all previously aforementioned incentives.3000$ GET IN THE VAN!

Jason and Robin have initiated ministry momentum at their local church plant in Apopka, FL with 24 people making decisions to follow Jesus and 4 people baptized since March 23, 2014 when they launched North Ridge Church and intend to take the same energy and momentum to Honduras. 
Honduras needs the hope of Jesus and you can be a ""hope sender"" by contributing financially. 
Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that some people just can't contribute financially. If this is you, the good news is that you can still help!
You can share this with your friends who you think have a heart for global missions and have the capacity to give. (Use the Indiegogo share tools)
You can pray! We believe in the power of prayer and hope that you will pray that our trip will have an effective influence on many people in Honduras.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Features</h3>
<details><summary>Do GuideWatches work without the app and/or with another app?</summary>GuideWatches work only with the onTracks app.</details> <details><summary>Is the onTracks app available without the GuideWatches?</summary>Yes, the onTracks app is available without the GuideWatches. It can be used as a straightforward GPS guiding app.</details> <details><summary>Do GuideWatches also work in an “offline” mode? </summary>If “offline” means “without a GSM connection,” then the answer is: Yes! GuideWatches work offline.  However, you’ll first need to load your track while the phone is connected to the Internet. The information is then stored on the phone. The GuideWatches are connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth, which receives the GPS signal and transmits it to your GuideWatches. Your phone, on the other hand, doesn’t need a GSM network to follow the selected route.</details> <details><summary>Can we use routes from our other apps (Strava, etc.)?</summary>Yes! We are able to upload existing routes from existing apps. To do this, you’ll need to set up the connection between our onTracks app and the third-party app you’ve used (Strava, Runkeeper, etc.). Not all apps will be available from the start, but we are working (very!) hard to make progress as quickly as possible.</details> <details><summary>Why 2 units? Wouldn’t one be enough?</summary> Several watches offer guiding information with itinerary map displays, and some vibrate once when it’s time to turn to one side, twice when you need to turn to the other side. It strikes us as impractical to read a map on a watch screen and uncomfortable to wear a watch with a screen large enough to read a map. As for watches that vibrate multiple times based on the directions you need to take, we don’t think that’s an intuitive form of guidance. It requires the brain to “decode in real time whether a vibration corresponds to the left or the right, and to do the same for two vibrations.” With two units – one on each wrist – there’s no need to think: The vibration is an extension of the arm, showing us the direction to take.</details> <details><summary>And what about vocal guidance? Isn’t that sufficient?</summary>Vocal guidance is interesting, but we find it to be “intrusive”: It requires the user to pay attention to the messages. Furthermore, it’s not practical during an athletic activity. To receive vocal guidance, you need to have a headset and keep it on all the time. That’s not very enjoyable when you’re joining friends for a hike or a job, and it can be uncomfortable when you’re on a bike for a long time. Furthermore, it’s hardly enjoyable to hear voices announcing, “In 100 feet, turn left,” when you’d perhaps rather be listening to music.</details> <details><summary>What if I don’t feel the vibrations (for example, if I’m biking on gravel)?</summary>GuideWatches offer three levels of information:1 - the vibrations, which help you understand whether you need to turn left or right.A first signal is given 15 seconds before the intersection (calculated based on your current speed) to alert you that you’ll need to turn, and a second vibration confirms when you need to turn.2 - light signals: The vibrating GuideWatch screen emits light to confirm that you need to turn to the side in question. That way, you can confirm information that might not be evident – for example, during an activity, such as mountain biking, that already involves vibrations.3 - an icon on the GuideWatch screen that vibrates to specify the type of turn to take in the event of a fork or junction with multiple options.</details> <details><summary>Why place the GuideWatches on the back of the hand?</summary>When you wear a watch in the usual way, you need to turn your wrist in order to read what’s on the screen. When you’re wearing a jacket or riding a bike or scooter, it’s even more complicated. Wearing your watch in “Sport Mode,” on the back of the hand, offers several advantages. First among these is that you can confirm the vibration of the watch by seeing the light signal, without needing to turn your eyes away from the path you’re following. Indeed, whether running or riding a bicycle or motorcycle, with the screen in our peripheral vision, we can detect the light signal confirming the information from the vibration, without needing to look down at the watch and away from the path. The benefits that this represents in the context of two-wheeled travel in a city are obvious. The second advantage is that if the user is wearing a jacket and needs to read the screen, he/she doesn’t need to pull up the sleeve. Obviously, on a bike or motorcycle, that’s a major advantage.</details> <details><summary>What happens if I take the wrong path?</summary>If I leave my pre-established route, the two GuideWatches start to vibrate to alert me to my error.</details> <details><summary>In the event of an error, will I be rerouted?</summary>That depends on the activity in progress and on your speed of movement. If you’re hiking, just turn around to get back on the right path when the two GuideWatches vibrate, because taking the wrong turn doesn’t call the whole itinerary into question. If you’re traveling rapidly, it depends on the user configurations. While traveling on two wheels in a city, for example, it makes sense that an alternate route will be suggested. While mountain biking, on the other hand, it will be possible to make a U-turn to get back on the right path.</details> <details><summary>Vibrations on the right hand to turn right, and on the left hand to turn left: OK, that I get, but what happens if I need to continue going straight ahead?</summary>Nothing: If the GuideWatch doesn’t tell you to turn, don’t turn.… The idea is to get directions if there is a question as you approach an intersection. If no information is provided, you just need to continue.</details> <details><summary>What kinds of directions are given in roundabouts?</summary>In roundabouts, the GuideWatch that vibrates will be the one on the side of the intersection that corresponds to the entrance into the roundabout. If I need to turn left at the roundabout, the left-hand watch will vibrate, and the same is true for the right. At the same time, the number of the roundabout exit will appear on the GuideWatch that vibrated. Example: If I enter a roundabout with four entrances, and I need to turn right, then the right-hand GuideWatch vibrates and the number “1” appears on its screen. If I need to turn left, then the left-hand GuideWatch vibrates and the number “3” appears on its screen. If I need to continue straight, the right-hand GuideWatch vibrates and the number “2” appears on its screen.</details> <details><summary>Why don’t the units have a touch screen?</summary>We’ve all tried to use smartphones during an athletic activity. Whether due to sweat or rain, it is very, very difficult to use the touch screen capabilities of a phone screen under such conditions. That’s why we decided to use a touch button to allow you to go through the menus on our GuideWatches. It’s a button that operates by touch, with sensitivity set so that it can pick up touch through a glove.</details> <details><summary>Are these GuideWatches useful for visually impaired people?</summary>We haven’t carried out tests, but it certainly seems logical that visually impaired people could be helped by onTracks GuideWatches. We would like to work with a partner familiar with this population in order to establish tests and, in all likelihood, a specialized app.</details> <details><summary>Are GuideWatches precise?</summary>Without seeking to be evasive or dodge the question, for these first GuideWatches, we don’t intend to reinvent the GPS. The idea is to consider that, given existing means, it is possible to prepare an itinerary, follow it intuitively, and share it so that the rest of the community has access to it. GuideWatches are connected to the smartphone via Bluetooth, so it’s the smartphone’s GPS that is used. In the end, then, the GuideWatches’ precision depends on the precision of the smartphone’s GPS. That means it’s a function of 1) the material elements: the quality of the GPS chip in the phone; and 2) where the smartphone is located: the area’s GPS coverage.</details> <details><summary>Is it a sure thing that I’ll find tracks in my area?</summary>No, unfortunately not yet. We are making every effort to add tracks to the onTracks app, but we may run into rejections from the owners of those routes. On the other hand, nothing is stopping a user from uploading a route to the site and importing it to the onTracks community. Time will take care of the rest, and thanks to your contributions, you’ll be able to enjoy many tracks.</details> <details><summary>Can I keep a Track private?</summary>The basic principle of sharing and community makes us reticent to authorize Tracks in private mode. However, there are some cases in which professionals wish to keep their routes private for their clients’ use. Therefore, we are providing a subscription-based system that will allow those users to save their tracks in private mode. For users who don’t wish to subscribe, it will be possible to keep just one track in private mode</details><h3>
<br/>Specs</h3>
<details><summary>What is the battery life of the watches with ordinary use?</summary>onTracks GuideWatches can run for up to 36 hours in city mode. City mode refers to use without GPS. You use the watches only to monitor your activity (pedometer, heart rate monitor, calories, etc.).</details> <details><summary>What is the battery life with GPS?</summary> In GPS guidance mode, GuideWatches can run for up to seven hours. However, that battery life may vary depending on the type of routes encountered. An alert is sent to you prior to the start of your activity if we find that the GuideWatch’s battery life is insufficient to complete the route that you’ve selected. Your GuideWatch must be connected to your smartphone. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that your smartphone have sufficient battery before you start your route.Warranties</details> <details><summary>Are onTracks GuideWatches under warranty?</summary> There are warranties specific to each part of the world: Europe: 2 years, Rest of the world: 1 year. If the unit is defective, it will be replaced or repaired at our expense during the warranty period.Campaign</details> <details><summary>Can I cancel an order?</summary>Yes, of course, if that cancellation takes place prior to the end of the campaign.</details> <details><summary>When are we going to receive our watches?</summary>We think that you will receive your GuideWatches within 43 months after the end of the Indiegogo campaign.</details><br/><strong>We haven’t answered your question? Send us your question through the contact form below.

<p><strong>Julien Absalon</strong>, double champion olympique et quintuple champion du monde de VTT cross-country, un des plus beau palmarès du sport français, a découvert les GuideWatch onTracks lors d'une rencontre avec Philippe Leca, CEO. Julien a tout de suite<strong> identifié les avantages et l'apport que onTracks pouvait offrir aux différents pratiquants de VTT ou même de vélo citadin.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536607283/maauho5c75c3ljpdjfag.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Dans cet interview, nous vous invitons à découvrir la carrière de Julien, les choix qui l'ont amené à arrêter la compétition à haut-niveau,  sa vision sur l'essor du vélo à assistance électrique... <strong>mais surtout son rôle, son implication, son apport au coeur du projet onTracks.​</strong></p>

<h3>Fonctionnalités</h3>
<details><summary>Les GuideWatch fonctionnent-elles sans l’application et/ou avec une autre application?</summary> Les GuideWatches fonctionnent uniquement avec l’application onTracks.</details><details><summary>L’application onTracks est-elle disponible sans les GuideWatch?</summary>​Oui, l’application onTracks est disponible sans les GuideWatch. Elle peut être utilisée comme simple app de guidage GPS. </details><details><summary>Les GuideWatches fonctionnent-elles aussi en mode « hors connexion »?</summary>Si hors connexion veut dire “sans connexion à un réseau GSM”, la réponse est : Oui ! Les GuideWatches fonctionnent hors-connexion. Dans un premier temps, il faut cependant obtenir son parcours lorsque le téléphone est connecté à internet. Les informations sont alors stockées sur le téléphone. Les GuideWatches sont connectées en Bluetooth avec votre smartphone et c’est lui qui reçoit le signal GPS et le transmet à vos GuideWatches. Votre téléphone n’a en revanche pas besoin du réseau GSM pour suivre le parcours sélectionné. Ainsi nos GuideWatches fonctionnent hors-connexion. Ce n’est que si vous décidez de changer de parcours qu’il vous faudra une connexion internet.</details><details><summary>Peut-on utiliser les parcours de nos autres applications (Strava, …)?</summary>Oui nous sommes en mesure de faire remonter des parcours existants sur des applications déjà existantes. Pour cela il faudra configurer la connexion entre notre application onTracks et l’application tierce utilisée (Strava par exemple …). Toutes les applications ne seront pas disponibles dès le départ masi nous travaillons dur (très dur) pour que cela avance le plus vite possible.</details><details><summary>Pourquoi 2 modules ? un seul ne suffirait pas?</summary>Plusieurs montres proposent des informations de guidage avec des représentations cartographiques des itinéraires, et certaines vibrent une fois lorsqu’il faut tourner d’un côté, et 2 fois lorsqu’il faut tourner de l’autre. Il nous semble illusoire de lire une carte sur un écran de montre, et inconfortable d’avoir une montre qui aurait un écran d’une taille suffisante pour la lecture d’une carte. Concernant les montres qui vibrent plusieurs fois en fonction des directions à prendre, nous pensons que ce type de guidage n’est pas intuitif. Il demande au cerveau de “décoder en temps réel si une vibration correspond à la gauche ou la droite, et pareillement pour deux vibrations”. Avec deux modules -un sur chaque poignet- on n’a pas besoin de réfléchir : la vibration est l’extension du bras qui nous montre la direction.</details><details><summary>Et le guidage vocal, n’est ce pas suffisant?</summary>Le guidage vocal est intéressant mais nous pensons qu’il est “intrusif”, c’est à dire qu’il oblige l’utilisateur à être attentif aux messages. En outre, ce n’est pas pratique lors d’une activité sportive : être guidé vocalement, nécessite d’avoir un casque audio et de le garder en permanence. Cela est peu agréable lorsqu’on partage une randonnée ou un running avec des amis, cela peut être inconfortable lorsqu’on roule longtemps à vélo. En outre, il est peu agréable d’entendre des voix annoncer “dans 30 mètres, tourner à gauche” alors que l’envie peut être d’écouter de la musique.</details><details><summary>Et si je ne sens pas les vibrations (par exemple, je roule sur des graviers)?</summary>Les GuideWatches proposent 3 niveaux d’information : 1) Les vibrations, qui permettent de comprende s’il faut tourner à droite ou à gauche. Un premier signal est donné 15 secondes avant l’intersection (calcul en fonction de la vitesse instantannée) pour avertir qu’il va falloir tourner, et une seconde vibration pour confirmer qu’il faut tourner. 2) Des signaux lumineux : l’écran de la GuideWatch qui vibre émet de la lumière de façon à confirmer qu’il faut bien tourner du côté annoncé. Ainsi, il est possible de confirmer une information qui ne serait pas certaine comme un trajet en VTT souvent soumis à des vibrations. 3) Un pictogramme sur l’écran de la GuideWatch qui vibre, pour préciser le type de bifurcation à suivre dans le cas où il y a plusieurs options du côté de la bifurcation.</details><details><summary>Pourquoi positionner les GuideWatches sur le dessus de la main?</summary>Lorsqu’on porte une montre de manière classique, il faut tourner son poignet pour pouvoir lire ce qui est sur l’écran. Lorsqu’on porte une veste ou que l’on conduit un vélo ou un scooter, l’opération est encore plus compliquée. Le fait de porter sa montre en mode “sport”, c’est à dire sur le dessus de la main, présente plusieurs avantages : le premier est de pouvoir confirmer la vibration de la montre par la visualisation du signal lumineux sans avoir besoin de détourner son regard de la route que l’on suit. En effet, que ce soit en courant ou en conduisant un vélo ou une moto, l’écran se situant en périphérie de champ de vision, nous pouvons détecter le signal lumineux confirmant l’information de vibration, sans avoir besoin de regarder sa montre, et donc de quitter la route des yeux. Inutile de préciser le bénéfice que cela représente dans un contexte de circulation à 2-roues en ville. Le second avantage est que si l’utilisateur doit lire l’écran, alors il n’a pas a soulever la manche de sa veste s’il en porte une. Evidemment, sur un 2-roues cela est un avantage majeur.</details><details><summary>Que se passe-t-il si je me trompe de chemin?</summary>Si je sors de mon parcours pré-établi, les deux GuideWatchs se mettent à vibrer pour m’indiquer mon erreur. </details><details><summary>Serai-je rerouté en cas d’erreur?</summary>Cela dépend de l’activité en cours et de la vitesse de déplacement. En cas de randonnée, il suffit de faire demi-tour pour reprendre le bon chemin lorsque les 2 GuideWatches vibrent car l’erreur de bifurcation ne remet pas en cause l’itinéraire. En cas de déplacement rapide, cela dépend de la configuration de l’utilisateur. On peut imaginer qu’en 2-roues en ville, un itinéraire alternatif est proposé. En revanche, pour une sortie VTT, il sera possible de faire demi tour pour reprendre le bon chemin.</details><details><summary>Vibrations à droite pour tourner à droite, et à gauche pour tourner à gauche : ok je comprends, mais que se passe-t-il si je dois continuer tout droit?</summary>Rien : si la GuideWatch ne dit pas de tourner, il ne faut pas tourner… L’idée est d’avoir une indication s’il y a une interrogation à l’approche d’une intersection. S’il n’y a pas d’information, il faut continuer.</details><details><summary>Et dans les ronds-points, qu’est-il indiqué?</summary>Dans les rond-point, la guideWatch qui vibrera sera celle du côté de la bifurcation, par rapport à l’axe d’entrée dans le rond-point. Si je dois tourner à gauche au rond-point, c’est celle de gauche qui vibre, et inversement. En même temps, il sera mentionné le numéro de la sortie du rond-point sur l’écran de la GuideWatch qui a vibré. Exemple : Si je rentre dans un rond-point à 4 entrées, et que je dois tourner à droite, alors la GuideWatch de droite vibre et le chiffre “1” est inscrit sur son écran. Si je dois tourner à gauche, alors la GuideWatch de gauche vibre et le chiffre “3” est inscrit sur son écran. Si je dois aller tout droit, la GuideWatch de droite vibre et le chiffre “2” est inscrit sur son écran.</details><details><summary>Pourquoi l’écran des modules n’est-il pas tactile?</summary>Nous avons tous essayé d’utiliser des smartphones au cours d’une activité sportive. Que ce soit la transpiration ou la pluie, il est très très compliqué d’utiliser les capacités tactiles d’un écran de téléphone. Ainsi, pour pouvoir circuler dans les menus de nos GuideWatches, nous avons décidé d’utiliser un bouton tactile. C’est un bouton qui fonctionne au toucher, et dont la sensibilité est réglée pour fonctionner à travers un gant.</details><details><summary>Ces GuideWatches peuvent-elles servir aux personnes malvoyantes?</summary>Nous n’avons pas fait de tests, mais il semble évident que les malvoyants pourraient être aidés avec les GuideWatches onTracks. Nous voulons nous associer à un partenaire habitué à cette population pour mettre en place des tests et surement une application spécifique.</details><details><summary> Les GuideWatches sont elles précises?</summary>Sans vouloir se dédouaner ou éviter la question, pour ces premières GuideWatches, nous n’avons pas l’intention de réinventer le GPS. L’idée c’est de se dire qu’avec les moyens existants, il est possible de préparer un itinéraire, de le suivre intuitivement et de le partager pour le mettre à la disposition du reste de la communauté. Les GuideWatches sont connectées en Bluetooth au smartphone, et c’est donc le GPS du smartphone qui est sollicité. Au final, la précision des GuideWatches dépendent donc de la précision du GPS du smartphone, et en conséquence 1) des éléments matériels : qualité de la puce GPS dans le téléphone, et 2) de l’endroit ou le smartphone se trouve : couverture GPS de la zone.</details><details><summary>Suis-je sûr de trouver des parcours dans ma région?</summary>Non, clairement non. Nous faisons tous nos efforts pour apporter des parcours dans l’application onTracks, mais nous pouvons nous heurter à des refus de la part des propriétaires de ces parcours. En revanche, rien n’empêche un utilisateur de télécharger un parcours sur un site et de l’importer pour la communauté onTracks. Le temps fera son œuvre et grâce à vous, vous pourrez bénéficier de nombreux parcours.</details><details><summary>Puis je garder un Track privatif?</summary><p>Le principe même du partage et de la communauté ne nous incite pas à autoriser des Tracks en mode privé. Pour autant, il y a des cas ou des professionnels veulent conserver leur parcours privés pour l’utilisation de leurs clients. Nous permettons alors un système d’abonnement qui permet à ces utilisateurs de garder des parcours en mode privé. Pour les utilisateurs qui ne veulent pas souscrire d’abonnement, il sera possible de maintenir un seul parcours en mode privé.</p></details><h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Specs</strong></h3>
<details><summary>Quelle est l’autonomie des montres en usage simple?</summary>Les GuideWatch onTracks peuvent tenir jusqu’à 36 heures en mode ville. Ce mode ville correspond à une utilisation sans le GPS. Vous utilisez les montres uniquement en suivi de votre activité (podomètre, cardiofréquencemètre, calories etc …).</details><details><summary>Quelle est l’autonomie avec le GPS?</summary>Les GuideWatches en mode guidage GPS tiennent jusqu’à 7 heures. Cependant cette autonomie varie en fonction de la typologie des parcours rencontrés. Une alerte vous est envoyée avant le début de votre activité si nous observons que l’autonomie des GuideWatch n’est pas suffisante pour finaliser le parcours que vous souhaitez réaliser. La connexion des GuideWatch avec votre smartphone est nécessaire. Il est donc indispensable que votre smartphone ait une autonomie suffisante avant de débuter votre parcours.  Garanties</details><details><summary>Les GuideWatch onTracks sont-elles sous garanties?</summary>Il existe des garanties propres à chaque partie du monde: Europe : 2 ans, Reste du monde : 1 an. Si le module est défectueux, il sera remplacé ou réparé à nos frais pendant la durée de la garantie. Campagne</details><details><summary>Puis je annuler une commande?</summary>Oui, bien sûr, si cette annulation intervient avant la fin de la campagne.</details><details><summary>Quand allons-nous recevoir nos montres?</summary><p>Nous pensons que vous recevrez vos GuideWatches en début d’année 2019 au plus tard.</p></details>

But at every intersection, you wonder whether you should turn left or right. You take out your map or phone to figure out where you are, try to remember the intersections, lose your way… It’s complicated!With onTracks, you’ll no longer have to go looking for information; the information will come to you, intuitively. All you need is a smartphone and our two connected watches – we call them GuideWatches.You need to wear our two watches, one on each wrist! When you need to turn right, your right GuideWatch vibrates, and when you need to turn left, it’s the one on the left that vibrates!   onTracks makes it easier for you to get guidance on new routes. onTracks GuideWatches are multi-activity devices, appropriate for use while running or biking, but also on your motorcycle! A unique product for all the ways you get around. The GuideWatches worn in « Sport » mode The GuideWatches worn in « Classic » mode onTracks GuideWatches allow you to follow a track and monitor your everyday activities:Your runYour cycling trip or mountain biking adventure​Your family hikeAnd after all of that, do you want to take your bike to get home? Or do you simply use a scooter or motorcycle for your everyday transportation needs? onTracks is also there for your trips on two wheels. Select your route, put on your gloves, and insert the onTracks units... Julien Absalon, two-time Olympic champion and five-time cross-country mountain bike champion, one of France's finest sporting achievements, discovered the onTracks GuideWatches  during a meeting with Philippe Leca, CEO. Julien immediately identified the advantages and the contribution that onTracks could offer to the various mountain bike or even city bike practitioners.You can enjoy Julien’s interview if you understand French… See below in the French section of the page. In this interview, we invite you to discover Julien's career, the choices that led him to stop the high-level competition, his vision on the rise of the electric bike... but above all his role, his implication, its contribution to the heart of the onTracks project.
You choose a route, or “track,” from among the thousands suggested by our onTracks community,
You connect your GuideWatches,
You press “Go."", and you’re off!  
When you need to turn right, your right-hand watch vibrates, and when you need to turn left, it’s the one on the left that vibrates!      onTracks GuideWatches: so much more than just a GPS Tracks are rated and include comments and illustrations to help you choose the right one for you. The routes that you’ll find are added by the ""onTrackers""community: you, us, your friends, your partner, or a fellow onTracks user you don’t know... Each onTracker is welcome to leave a rating and comment to give their opinion of the track they’ve just completed. In addition, the source of each track is indicated. Is this an official route? Is this a fan-created track? It’s the easiest way to discover new tracks.  You can:

import tracks in the typical formats: GPX, KML…


design your route on the my.onTracks website


design your track on your smartphone


connect to your account on a sports app such as Strava

get from Point A to Point B

Connecting your bracelets Our GuideWatches can be worn two ways:
“Sport” mode: You can place your watches on the back of your hands. Advantages: The information displayed on the watch screens is easily accessible without needing to turn your wrists, like a typical activity watch, and without needing to pull up the sleeve of your jacket. The information is available at a glance.
“Classic” mode: You wear your watches around your wrists, like typical watches, using the specially designed bracelet.Accessories suited to your activityDo you enjoy mountain biking or road cycling on a regular basis? Don’t worry, cycling fans – we’ve thought of you, too! We are working on the design of short and long cycling gloves with a place to insert the modules.Do you commute via scooter or motorbike, or regularly ride a two-wheeler? We are currently investigating potential partnerships with motor bike gloves makers. We will be able to market them soon. Pursue your activity: Stop looking at screens and maps so you can enjoy your routeTo provide intuitive navigation, GuideWatches offer three levels of information:

the vibrations, which help you understand whether you need to turn left or right. 

light signals: The vibrating GuideWatch screen also emits light to confirm that you need to turn to the side in question. These light signals are perceptible in your peripheral vision, so you don't have to leave path of the eyes to get the information.

an icon on the GuideWatch screen that vibrates to specify the type of turn to take. Examples with the right GuideWatch:
   GuideWatches make it possible to:

Follow an itinerary: Navigation mode

Record your activity: Tracking mode

Act as a typical smartwatch: Daily mode

Features
Do GuideWatches work without the app and/or with another app?GuideWatches work only with the onTracks app. Is the onTracks app available without the GuideWatches?Yes, the onTracks app is available without the GuideWatches. It can be used as a straightforward GPS guiding app. Do GuideWatches also work in an “offline” mode? If “offline” means “without a GSM connection,” then the answer is: Yes! GuideWatches work offline.  However, you’ll first need to load your track while the phone is connected to the Internet. The information is then stored on the phone. The GuideWatches are connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth, which receives the GPS signal and transmits it to your GuideWatches. Your phone, on the other hand, doesn’t need a GSM network to follow the selected route. Can we use routes from our other apps (Strava, etc.)?Yes! We are able to upload existing routes from existing apps. To do this, you’ll need to set up the connection between our onTracks app and the third-party app you’ve used (Strava, Runkeeper, etc.). Not all apps will be available from the start, but we are working (very!) hard to make progress as quickly as possible. Why 2 units? Wouldn’t one be enough? Several watches offer guiding information with itinerary map displays, and some vibrate once when it’s time to turn to one side, twice when you need to turn to the other side. It strikes us as impractical to read a map on a watch screen and uncomfortable to wear a watch with a screen large enough to read a map. As for watches that vibrate multiple times based on the directions you need to take, we don’t think that’s an intuitive form of guidance. It requires the brain to “decode in real time whether a vibration corresponds to the left or the right, and to do the same for two vibrations.” With two units – one on each wrist – there’s no need to think: The vibration is an extension of the arm, showing us the direction to take. And what about vocal guidance? Isn’t that sufficient?Vocal guidance is interesting, but we find it to be “intrusive”: It requires the user to pay attention to the messages. Furthermore, it’s not practical during an athletic activity. To receive vocal guidance, you need to have a headset and keep it on all the time. That’s not very enjoyable when you’re joining friends for a hike or a job, and it can be uncomfortable when you’re on a bike for a long time. Furthermore, it’s hardly enjoyable to hear voices announcing, “In 100 feet, turn left,” when you’d perhaps rather be listening to music. What if I don’t feel the vibrations (for example, if I’m biking on gravel)?GuideWatches offer three levels of information:1 - the vibrations, which help you understand whether you need to turn left or right.A first signal is given 15 seconds before the intersection (calculated based on your current speed) to alert you that you’ll need to turn, and a second vibration confirms when you need to turn.2 - light signals: The vibrating GuideWatch screen emits light to confirm that you need to turn to the side in question. That way, you can confirm information that might not be evident – for example, during an activity, such as mountain biking, that already involves vibrations.3 - an icon on the GuideWatch screen that vibrates to specify the type of turn to take in the event of a fork or junction with multiple options. Why place the GuideWatches on the back of the hand?When you wear a watch in the usual way, you need to turn your wrist in order to read what’s on the screen. When you’re wearing a jacket or riding a bike or scooter, it’s even more complicated. Wearing your watch in “Sport Mode,” on the back of the hand, offers several advantages. First among these is that you can confirm the vibration of the watch by seeing the light signal, without needing to turn your eyes away from the path you’re following. Indeed, whether running or riding a bicycle or motorcycle, with the screen in our peripheral vision, we can detect the light signal confirming the information from the vibration, without needing to look down at the watch and away from the path. The benefits that this represents in the context of two-wheeled travel in a city are obvious. The second advantage is that if the user is wearing a jacket and needs to read the screen, he/she doesn’t need to pull up the sleeve. Obviously, on a bike or motorcycle, that’s a major advantage. What happens if I take the wrong path?If I leave my pre-established route, the two GuideWatches start to vibrate to alert me to my error. In the event of an error, will I be rerouted?That depends on the activity in progress and on your speed of movement. If you’re hiking, just turn around to get back on the right path when the two GuideWatches vibrate, because taking the wrong turn doesn’t call the whole itinerary into question. If you’re traveling rapidly, it depends on the user configurations. While traveling on two wheels in a city, for example, it makes sense that an alternate route will be suggested. While mountain biking, on the other hand, it will be possible to make a U-turn to get back on the right path. Vibrations on the right hand to turn right, and on the left hand to turn left: OK, that I get, but what happens if I need to continue going straight ahead?Nothing: If the GuideWatch doesn’t tell you to turn, don’t turn.… The idea is to get directions if there is a question as you approach an intersection. If no information is provided, you just need to continue. What kinds of directions are given in roundabouts?In roundabouts, the GuideWatch that vibrates will be the one on the side of the intersection that corresponds to the entrance into the roundabout. If I need to turn left at the roundabout, the left-hand watch will vibrate, and the same is true for the right. At the same time, the number of the roundabout exit will appear on the GuideWatch that vibrated. Example: If I enter a roundabout with four entrances, and I need to turn right, then the right-hand GuideWatch vibrates and the number “1” appears on its screen. If I need to turn left, then the left-hand GuideWatch vibrates and the number “3” appears on its screen. If I need to continue straight, the right-hand GuideWatch vibrates and the number “2” appears on its screen. Why don’t the units have a touch screen?We’ve all tried to use smartphones during an athletic activity. Whether due to sweat or rain, it is very, very difficult to use the touch screen capabilities of a phone screen under such conditions. That’s why we decided to use a touch button to allow you to go through the menus on our GuideWatches. It’s a button that operates by touch, with sensitivity set so that it can pick up touch through a glove. Are these GuideWatches useful for visually impaired people?We haven’t carried out tests, but it certainly seems logical that visually impaired people could be helped by onTracks GuideWatches. We would like to work with a partner familiar with this population in order to establish tests and, in all likelihood, a specialized app. Are GuideWatches precise?Without seeking to be evasive or dodge the question, for these first GuideWatches, we don’t intend to reinvent the GPS. The idea is to consider that, given existing means, it is possible to prepare an itinerary, follow it intuitively, and share it so that the rest of the community has access to it. GuideWatches are connected to the smartphone via Bluetooth, so it’s the smartphone’s GPS that is used. In the end, then, the GuideWatches’ precision depends on the precision of the smartphone’s GPS. That means it’s a function of 1) the material elements: the quality of the GPS chip in the phone; and 2) where the smartphone is located: the area’s GPS coverage. Is it a sure thing that I’ll find tracks in my area?No, unfortunately not yet. We are making every effort to add tracks to the onTracks app, but we may run into rejections from the owners of those routes. On the other hand, nothing is stopping a user from uploading a route to the site and importing it to the onTracks community. Time will take care of the rest, and thanks to your contributions, you’ll be able to enjoy many tracks. Can I keep a Track private?The basic principle of sharing and community makes us reticent to authorize Tracks in private mode. However, there are some cases in which professionals wish to keep their routes private for their clients’ use. Therefore, we are providing a subscription-based system that will allow those users to save their tracks in private mode. For users who don’t wish to subscribe, it will be possible to keep just one track in private mode
Specs
What is the battery life of the watches with ordinary use?onTracks GuideWatches can run for up to 36 hours in city mode. City mode refers to use without GPS. You use the watches only to monitor your activity (pedometer, heart rate monitor, calories, etc.). What is the battery life with GPS? In GPS guidance mode, GuideWatches can run for up to seven hours. However, that battery life may vary depending on the type of routes encountered. An alert is sent to you prior to the start of your activity if we find that the GuideWatch’s battery life is insufficient to complete the route that you’ve selected. Your GuideWatch must be connected to your smartphone. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that your smartphone have sufficient battery before you start your route.Warranties Are onTracks GuideWatches under warranty? There are warranties specific to each part of the world: Europe: 2 years, Rest of the world: 1 year. If the unit is defective, it will be replaced or repaired at our expense during the warranty period.Campaign Can I cancel an order?Yes, of course, if that cancellation takes place prior to the end of the campaign. When are we going to receive our watches?We think that you will receive your GuideWatches within 43 months after the end of the Indiegogo campaign.We haven’t answered your question? Send us your question through the contact form below.

Fonctionnalités
Les GuideWatch fonctionnent-elles sans l’application et/ou avec une autre application? Les GuideWatches fonctionnent uniquement avec l’application onTracks.L’application onTracks est-elle disponible sans les GuideWatch?​Oui, l’application onTracks est disponible sans les GuideWatch. Elle peut être utilisée comme simple app de guidage GPS. Les GuideWatches fonctionnent-elles aussi en mode « hors connexion »?Si hors connexion veut dire “sans connexion à un réseau GSM”, la réponse est : Oui ! Les GuideWatches fonctionnent hors-connexion. Dans un premier temps, il faut cependant obtenir son parcours lorsque le téléphone est connecté à internet. Les informations sont alors stockées sur le téléphone. Les GuideWatches sont connectées en Bluetooth avec votre smartphone et c’est lui qui reçoit le signal GPS et le transmet à vos GuideWatches. Votre téléphone n’a en revanche pas besoin du réseau GSM pour suivre le parcours sélectionné. Ainsi nos GuideWatches fonctionnent hors-connexion. Ce n’est que si vous décidez de changer de parcours qu’il vous faudra une connexion internet.Peut-on utiliser les parcours de nos autres applications (Strava, …)?Oui nous sommes en mesure de faire remonter des parcours existants sur des applications déjà existantes. Pour cela il faudra configurer la connexion entre notre application onTracks et l’application tierce utilisée (Strava par exemple …). Toutes les applications ne seront pas disponibles dès le départ masi nous travaillons dur (très dur) pour que cela avance le plus vite possible.Pourquoi 2 modules ? un seul ne suffirait pas?Plusieurs montres proposent des informations de guidage avec des représentations cartographiques des itinéraires, et certaines vibrent une fois lorsqu’il faut tourner d’un côté, et 2 fois lorsqu’il faut tourner de l’autre. Il nous semble illusoire de lire une carte sur un écran de montre, et inconfortable d’avoir une montre qui aurait un écran d’une taille suffisante pour la lecture d’une carte. Concernant les montres qui vibrent plusieurs fois en fonction des directions à prendre, nous pensons que ce type de guidage n’est pas intuitif. Il demande au cerveau de “décoder en temps réel si une vibration correspond à la gauche ou la droite, et pareillement pour deux vibrations”. Avec deux modules -un sur chaque poignet- on n’a pas besoin de réfléchir : la vibration est l’extension du bras qui nous montre la direction.Et le guidage vocal, n’est ce pas suffisant?Le guidage vocal est intéressant mais nous pensons qu’il est “intrusif”, c’est à dire qu’il oblige l’utilisateur à être attentif aux messages. En outre, ce n’est pas pratique lors d’une activité sportive : être guidé vocalement, nécessite d’avoir un casque audio et de le garder en permanence. Cela est peu agréable lorsqu’on partage une randonnée ou un running avec des amis, cela peut être inconfortable lorsqu’on roule longtemps à vélo. En outre, il est peu agréable d’entendre des voix annoncer “dans 30 mètres, tourner à gauche” alors que l’envie peut être d’écouter de la musique.Et si je ne sens pas les vibrations (par exemple, je roule sur des graviers)?Les GuideWatches proposent 3 niveaux d’information : 1) Les vibrations, qui permettent de comprende s’il faut tourner à droite ou à gauche. Un premier signal est donné 15 secondes avant l’intersection (calcul en fonction de la vitesse instantannée) pour avertir qu’il va falloir tourner, et une seconde vibration pour confirmer qu’il faut tourner. 2) Des signaux lumineux : l’écran de la GuideWatch qui vibre émet de la lumière de façon à confirmer qu’il faut bien tourner du côté annoncé. Ainsi, il est possible de confirmer une information qui ne serait pas certaine comme un trajet en VTT souvent soumis à des vibrations. 3) Un pictogramme sur l’écran de la GuideWatch qui vibre, pour préciser le type de bifurcation à suivre dans le cas où il y a plusieurs options du côté de la bifurcation.Pourquoi positionner les GuideWatches sur le dessus de la main?Lorsqu’on porte une montre de manière classique, il faut tourner son poignet pour pouvoir lire ce qui est sur l’écran. Lorsqu’on porte une veste ou que l’on conduit un vélo ou un scooter, l’opération est encore plus compliquée. Le fait de porter sa montre en mode “sport”, c’est à dire sur le dessus de la main, présente plusieurs avantages : le premier est de pouvoir confirmer la vibration de la montre par la visualisation du signal lumineux sans avoir besoin de détourner son regard de la route que l’on suit. En effet, que ce soit en courant ou en conduisant un vélo ou une moto, l’écran se situant en périphérie de champ de vision, nous pouvons détecter le signal lumineux confirmant l’information de vibration, sans avoir besoin de regarder sa montre, et donc de quitter la route des yeux. Inutile de préciser le bénéfice que cela représente dans un contexte de circulation à 2-roues en ville. Le second avantage est que si l’utilisateur doit lire l’écran, alors il n’a pas a soulever la manche de sa veste s’il en porte une. Evidemment, sur un 2-roues cela est un avantage majeur.Que se passe-t-il si je me trompe de chemin?Si je sors de mon parcours pré-établi, les deux GuideWatchs se mettent à vibrer pour m’indiquer mon erreur. Serai-je rerouté en cas d’erreur?Cela dépend de l’activité en cours et de la vitesse de déplacement. En cas de randonnée, il suffit de faire demi-tour pour reprendre le bon chemin lorsque les 2 GuideWatches vibrent car l’erreur de bifurcation ne remet pas en cause l’itinéraire. En cas de déplacement rapide, cela dépend de la configuration de l’utilisateur. On peut imaginer qu’en 2-roues en ville, un itinéraire alternatif est proposé. En revanche, pour une sortie VTT, il sera possible de faire demi tour pour reprendre le bon chemin.Vibrations à droite pour tourner à droite, et à gauche pour tourner à gauche : ok je comprends, mais que se passe-t-il si je dois continuer tout droit?Rien : si la GuideWatch ne dit pas de tourner, il ne faut pas tourner… L’idée est d’avoir une indication s’il y a une interrogation à l’approche d’une intersection. S’il n’y a pas d’information, il faut continuer.Et dans les ronds-points, qu’est-il indiqué?Dans les rond-point, la guideWatch qui vibrera sera celle du côté de la bifurcation, par rapport à l’axe d’entrée dans le rond-point. Si je dois tourner à gauche au rond-point, c’est celle de gauche qui vibre, et inversement. En même temps, il sera mentionné le numéro de la sortie du rond-point sur l’écran de la GuideWatch qui a vibré. Exemple : Si je rentre dans un rond-point à 4 entrées, et que je dois tourner à droite, alors la GuideWatch de droite vibre et le chiffre “1” est inscrit sur son écran. Si je dois tourner à gauche, alors la GuideWatch de gauche vibre et le chiffre “3” est inscrit sur son écran. Si je dois aller tout droit, la GuideWatch de droite vibre et le chiffre “2” est inscrit sur son écran.Pourquoi l’écran des modules n’est-il pas tactile?Nous avons tous essayé d’utiliser des smartphones au cours d’une activité sportive. Que ce soit la transpiration ou la pluie, il est très très compliqué d’utiliser les capacités tactiles d’un écran de téléphone. Ainsi, pour pouvoir circuler dans les menus de nos GuideWatches, nous avons décidé d’utiliser un bouton tactile. C’est un bouton qui fonctionne au toucher, et dont la sensibilité est réglée pour fonctionner à travers un gant.Ces GuideWatches peuvent-elles servir aux personnes malvoyantes?Nous n’avons pas fait de tests, mais il semble évident que les malvoyants pourraient être aidés avec les GuideWatches onTracks. Nous voulons nous associer à un partenaire habitué à cette population pour mettre en place des tests et surement une application spécifique. Les GuideWatches sont elles précises?Sans vouloir se dédouaner ou éviter la question, pour ces premières GuideWatches, nous n’avons pas l’intention de réinventer le GPS. L’idée c’est de se dire qu’avec les moyens existants, il est possible de préparer un itinéraire, de le suivre intuitivement et de le partager pour le mettre à la disposition du reste de la communauté. Les GuideWatches sont connectées en Bluetooth au smartphone, et c’est donc le GPS du smartphone qui est sollicité. Au final, la précision des GuideWatches dépendent donc de la précision du GPS du smartphone, et en conséquence 1) des éléments matériels : qualité de la puce GPS dans le téléphone, et 2) de l’endroit ou le smartphone se trouve : couverture GPS de la zone.Suis-je sûr de trouver des parcours dans ma région?Non, clairement non. Nous faisons tous nos efforts pour apporter des parcours dans l’application onTracks, mais nous pouvons nous heurter à des refus de la part des propriétaires de ces parcours. En revanche, rien n’empêche un utilisateur de télécharger un parcours sur un site et de l’importer pour la communauté onTracks. Le temps fera son œuvre et grâce à vous, vous pourrez bénéficier de nombreux parcours.Puis je garder un Track privatif?Le principe même du partage et de la communauté ne nous incite pas à autoriser des Tracks en mode privé. Pour autant, il y a des cas ou des professionnels veulent conserver leur parcours privés pour l’utilisation de leurs clients. Nous permettons alors un système d’abonnement qui permet à ces utilisateurs de garder des parcours en mode privé. Pour les utilisateurs qui ne veulent pas souscrire d’abonnement, il sera possible de maintenir un seul parcours en mode privé. 
Specs
Quelle est l’autonomie des montres en usage simple?Les GuideWatch onTracks peuvent tenir jusqu’à 36 heures en mode ville. Ce mode ville correspond à une utilisation sans le GPS. Vous utilisez les montres uniquement en suivi de votre activité (podomètre, cardiofréquencemètre, calories etc …).Quelle est l’autonomie avec le GPS?Les GuideWatches en mode guidage GPS tiennent jusqu’à 7 heures. Cependant cette autonomie varie en fonction de la typologie des parcours rencontrés. Une alerte vous est envoyée avant le début de votre activité si nous observons que l’autonomie des GuideWatch n’est pas suffisante pour finaliser le parcours que vous souhaitez réaliser. La connexion des GuideWatch avec votre smartphone est nécessaire. Il est donc indispensable que votre smartphone ait une autonomie suffisante avant de débuter votre parcours.  GarantiesLes GuideWatch onTracks sont-elles sous garanties?Il existe des garanties propres à chaque partie du monde: Europe : 2 ans, Reste du monde : 1 an. Si le module est défectueux, il sera remplacé ou réparé à nos frais pendant la durée de la garantie. CampagnePuis je annuler une commande?Oui, bien sûr, si cette annulation intervient avant la fin de la campagne.Quand allons-nous recevoir nos montres?Nous pensons que vous recevrez vos GuideWatches en début d’année 2019 au plus tard.

It’s a 60 quart, all-in-one hub for your camping trip, picnic or beach day. Packed with the features you’d want if you’d designed it yourself.  We designed the RollR 60 with the features we wanted to use as outdoor enthusiasts ourselves. And we think you’ll enjoy them as well.  Up to 10 day ice retention makes your time in the great outdoors greater for even longer. Deep dry storage bin for clean cocktail ice, holds corked bottles of wine upright and stays 34-36 degrees dry, for up to 10 days.  We are Bear Certified. We put our cooler to the test and even grizzly bears weren’t able to break into it.   No other cooler can go anywhere and do anything.   Today’s coolers have a serious problem – they’re not cool at all. They leave you food soggy, your drinks warm, and they are heavy to move around. The RollR 60 is a cooler packed with the features you actually need on your mission to chillax with mother nature in the ultimate way.  Getting into the great outdoors shouldn’t be a challenge. So we made the RollR 60 the most portable cooler around. It’s hardy and tough, but it’s roto-molded construction and all terrain wheels make it easy to take anywhere with you. And the tires are puncture-resistant, so you won’t ever be left with a cooler flat.  And make great use of the pop up wagon bin for hauling and storing gear. The RollR 60 is the first ever cooler that hitches right onto the back of your bike. You can roll right up to your campsite in style. The bike hitch is super lightweight and easy to use – the bracket installs in minutes. Just pop off the plate and replace it with the tow bracket and you’re on your way.  Don't believe that this is the best cooler ever? Check this out!  The RollR 60 keeps your stuff cool for up to ten days, no matter what it’s like outside. You’ll soon forget what warm beer tastes like.  That's what you get when you combine a rotomolded, elevated body with an airtight gasket and thick foam insulation. Think of the RollR 60 as a kind of portable fridge. You can organize your stuff in different compartments, so the deli meats don’t end up rubbing against your sodas and turning everything into a soggy mess. Our full height divided insert stays under 40° for up to 10 days and makes sure your dry goods stay both dry and good.   In keeping with the RollR 60’s commitment to being your outdoor hub, it can transform into a mobile food and drink prep station with cup holders and fold-out cutting boards for dirt-free burgers and cocktails. Whether you’re cutting limes for the adults or PB&Js for the kids, this AnchR-compatible table is definitely the cutting board you're looking for.

Reach in, prep, and repeat. The dual cup holders attach to any anchor point, so they don't block access to the inside of the cooler. They can also hold stuff like phones, cameras, or the JBL 2 Speakers, if those are more your thing. Use the stash bag for whatever you need to stash. Perfect for wallets, keys, utensils. etc. Use it for pretty much anything.  The RollR 60 drains in seconds when you’re ready to pack up and head back to reality. But hopefully that won’t be for a while.

Don’t let spotty equipment cause you to miss it.   Making the RollR 60 is a fairly involved process. We’ve got the best people in the business helping us make it happen, and now we just need you. Be one of the first to support the RollR 60 and you’ll get a sweet deal when we roll out the first model (pun definitely intended).",52.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hostogether will work locally and globally to bring more advantages to its members based on the power of many. It is up to us allBut there’s more; join other hosts to act together and protect your business next to regulators or to work toward causes you defend – from social impact to landmark protection or global warming, etc. 21. How does Hostogether help me get lower services fees and prices?Hostogether will help you reduce costs, increase profits and access services you cannot get alone.Just think of the number of services you need to run your property and welcome your guests but you cannot afford.How do you access these expensive services or get more attention from the providers if they don’t think of you as an important client?How do you get lower prices on the services you are already buying?The answer to these questions is Hostogether. By joining, you get:
Services only large property managers have, at the prices they have them
Local services, like cleaning, laundry, power and the internet, mobile phone and services, etc. at lower rates because you are buying together with other hosts
 22. Why act in a single voice with other hosts for your causes and influence?We believe that we must put our strength and will into defending our views and causes.Joining Hostogether gives you the opportunity to do good, by doing that with many hosts that share the same views and causes.Whether you are in a city where regulation is tightening, or in a natural haven that needs protecting, defending your interests and causes requires the ability to make your voice heard. Hostogether ensures that your voice and that of other hosts and other people that share your views is amplified and heard.You will be able to take the same strategies made available to market your property and use them to collaborate with other hosts to have your message get across to the right peopleThis way, Hostogether members collaborate with each other to improve their business and we can also give back and contribute to make the world a better place 23. How many properties can I have on Hostogether?Our technology is optimized for individual short-term rental property owners – and not property management companies. You can have as many properties as you’d like on Hostogether, but we believe that if you have more than 10 properties, you will miss a few features that are important for managers with a large number of properties. Please, talk to us just in case. We are sure we can help. 24. What is the information needed to register in Hostogether?For now, the data you provide Indiegogo will be enough. In October, during the roll out of Hostogether, we will ask you for the same information about you and your property you provide to listing sites. This will be done via an easy to use setup. We will also be able to collect all your info from a limited number of listing sites, should you give you permissions to do so.  25. Is it possible to customize my website in Hostogether?We will start roll-out with a few standard Hostogether property website formats. As part of the continuous development and improvement of Hostogether platform, we are planning to introduce more flexible and customizable layouts. And most importantly, we will always make sure that Hostogether property websites are optimized for conversion of visitors into bookings. 26. I already have a property website. Can I keep it?You are free to keep your website, of course. You will also get a Hostogether property website, which supports all our marketing tools. All we have to do is make sure the calendars are synchronized and up-to-date in both sites, and we’ll have tools for that too. 27. Will I be able to take credit card payments?Yes, with Hostogether will be able to take all major credit cards and many other payment methods.Hostogether electronic payment solutions will also allow for you to charge the credit cards of your guests coming from listing sites and at a lower costs. 28. If I have questions, how can I reach your team?Please read through our FAQs first to find your answer.For questions related to the Indiegogo campaign, you can contact support@indiegogo.com. For all other questions regarding Hostogether, contact us via ruiescaleira@hostogether.com or joanafeijo@hostogether.com",56.0,0,"1 Campaign

Shark Wheel is built from a cube - flat on all 6 sides


Our Features:1.  Shark Wheels are fast.  The design allows for a thin contact patch touching the ground and therefore less rolling resistance resulting in a quicker ride.  2. Shark Wheels have more grip and sliding control.  The alternating pattern equates to increased control - the width is increased, but the friction is decreased!  The sine wave design provides three lips per wheel for superior lateral grip.  A traditional wheel only has one.  3.  Shark Wheels are better than traditional wheels on varying terrain.  The #1 advantage. The sine wave pattern smoothly funnels most debris aside instead of it being 'steamrolled' over like traditional wheels.  This has been scientifically proven by San Diego State University, Mechanical Engineering Department in 2 years of testing.4.  Shark Wheels are the perfect rain / gravel wheels.  The alternating pattern of grooves significantly reduces hydroplaning by channeling liquid, sand or gravel out and away from the surface of the wheel, allowing for a firm contact patch with the ground.  Also, the rounded edges allow liquid, sand or gravel to pass around the wheel, providing unparalleled grip over wet and loose traction surfaces.5. Shark Wheels last longer. Traditional wheels have one center point. Once they wear off center even slightly, the wheel is completely compromised. Shark Wheels are the only wheels with multiple center points and take longer to wear out (in cruising situations). This has been scientifically proven by San Diego State University, Mechanical Engineering Department in 2 years of testing.6. Shark Wheels have a unique 30 degree approach angle. Similar to how drivers know to go over speed bumps or dips in the road at an angle to reduce the shock. Shark Wheels always strike every obstacle at an angle reducing the shock to the rider and allowing for a smoother ride.  Shark Wheel Decks: First GenerationSign up for updates, deals, and win free gear on SharkWheel.com and/or SharkWheelSkate.com.  The Shark Wheel Skateboard Wheels (for street and trick riding) will be out after our longboard wheels. Testimonials-“These wheels make riding in the rain fun and safer because I have so much more control.

<p>Over the last year I worked to build Squirr3l, a mobile social network, now in beta, found at <a href=""http://squirr3l.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Squirr3l.com</a> . It allows users to keep tabs on their friends and share what they are up to. There's no liking, commenting, or sharing. It's a way to ""stay connected w/out connecting"". Not everyone has the time to bury themselves in a rabbit hole of social networks for days. I've worked to allow people to stay connected with those they care about fast and easily. It's a stress-free way of socializing and it makes status-updating fun! I see Squirr3l as my break into the tech scene and a stepping stone to a serial entrepreneurial future entwined with a life of service, people coaching, and dream building.</p>

Morpher folds &amp; unfolds quickly and simply, so it's perfect for cyclists who want to carry a helmet more easily. Patented worldwide, Morpher has been designed to exceed all relevant safety standards. Morpher is initially aimed at all cyclists; especially those urban ones who find normal helmets cumbersome to carry around all day. Eventually it will also be marketed to other users of sports safety helmets (skiers, skaters, snow boarders, hockey players, horse riders etc). </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Morpher's flat profile will also allow innovative selling methods, such as vending machines placed by major bicycle hire points.

<p><b>1.  Shipping Costs:</b> If you forgot to add shipping to your order then please <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/morpher-folding-helmet-technology/contributions/new"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click Here</a>, select <i>""No perk, I just want to contribute"",</i> change the amount from the default $100 to the correct amount ($10 US, $15 UK or $20 Rest of World) &amp; it will be matched to your order</p>
<p><b>2.  Shipping Addresses: </b>Before we ship anything we’ll be emailing &amp; asking you to confirm your address, so please don’t worry if you've moved since you ordered</p>
<p><b>3.  Colours:</b> The first Morphers that we ship don’t have a colour choice. We’ve already polled you on some choices &amp; I think they’ll be stunning. More about this as we get closer to May… It's looking likely that they'll be black (as shown under the ""What"" section, above) but this isn't yet guaranteed</p>
<p><b>4.  Size: </b>Our first model has a fit system. This means you can adjust your Morpher to fit heads with a circumference of between 50.5 &amp; 58cm. (19.8 to 22.7 inches. 6 1/8 to 7 1/8 UK hat sizes.) This covers a pretty wide range of heads from mid-teens to small ladies to medium+ men. Obviously, in the future, we'll produce a range of sizes including larger helmets &amp; children's helmets.</p>

In Europe and the USA more bicycles are now being sold than cars! And more and more cities around the world are introducing cycle rental schemes.It’s inevitable that as more people take to the road on a bicycle, more people will have accidents. When head meets road, vehicle or pavement without a helmet on it’s generally pretty messy… and sometimes fatal!When it's not fatal the injuries caused by brain damage can often be too awful to contemplate. Victims of brain injuries often spend years in a coma unable to communicate in any way or they lose the ability to live normal lives and can need constant care. More often than not, head injuries affect not just the victim but whole families.My campaign is to develop and manufacture Morpher, a new kind of helmet that folds flat so that it's easy to carry around when one isn't actually on a bicycle.   STOP PRESS: The Evening Standard, London's evening newspaper, reported on Thursday that after a cycling accident in Spitalfields on Monday night, 27-year-old Claire Pepper's head became trapped under a VW Golf. “If I had not been wearing my helmet I would have died,” she said. And, with five cycling deaths on London’s roads in the past nine days, many of us want all the protection we can get.Popular Science Magazine's Safety Invention of the yearMorpher literally folds in half when not in use. It will slide away into a bag with little more fuss than a laptop. With Morpher, cyclists will find it easier to always have a helmet at hand. More helmets =  fewer head injuries and fatalities.Help Morpher happen sooner - pick a perk nowSome people have asked me why we have quoted our perks in US$ and not UK£. The answer is that I had to pick one or other currency and as most funds are likely to come from the good old US of A I thought that Dollars would be more appropriate. Currently £1.00 is worth around $1.29. Which means that a rough value of our perks is as follows:$100= £77.47                  $150 = £116.20                    $300 = £232.41Don't forget to add your postage!   Morpher is the world’s first fold-flat helmet. Morpher folds & unfolds quickly and simply, so it's perfect for cyclists who want to carry a helmet more easily. Patented worldwide, Morpher has been designed to exceed all relevant safety standards. Morpher is initially aimed at all cyclists; especially those urban ones who find normal helmets cumbersome to carry around all day. Eventually it will also be marketed to other users of sports safety helmets (skiers, skaters, snow boarders, hockey players, horse riders etc). Morpher's flat profile will also allow innovative selling methods, such as vending machines placed by major bicycle hire points. Morpher aims to give the world an unprecedented ease of access to cycle safety. At Morpher we also believe in a greener planet, so we've ensured that our helmets and their components are made from recyclable materials.    Check out the image gallery for more images of Morpher People love Morpher. Even as a prototype, it's already won three major international innovation awards.                  I'm Jeff, an inventor from the UK. I'm also a keen urban cyclist. I’ve been working hard to develop this product for the past 2 years.I have been involved with successful innovation and new product development for many years and have worked with hundreds of inventors over the past 20 years helping them to get their ideas made and their products to market.I am utilising everything I've learned as well as the skills of the team that I’ve built around me to ensure that this product is an incredible improvement over existing technologies. I am chairman of the Judging panel for the World Innovation Awards that are held annually in London and I really believe that with my experience I have what it takes to make this product work. Well.MORE ABOUT THE INVENTOR: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Woolf    After I came up with the idea for Morpher I knew that I needed to get some top quality Industrial Design done, so I contacted some of the world's leading industrial design companies to ask them to tender for the project. After careful consideration, I chose Therefore Limited, as, rather unsurprisingly, they came up with by far the best solutions. Therefore work with great companies like Braun, Asus, Samsonite, Tom Tom, etc.,and were the design house responsible for the groundbreaking Psion Series 5 PDA range.Therefore were also responsible for the design and development of the GravityLight, which raised $399,590.00 on Indiegogo in a campaign that was oversubscribed 727%. They are World Class designers and their work on Morpher has been incredible. I have been involved with manufacturers and injection moulders for many years and after visiting and getting manufacturing quotations from dozens of helmet manufacturers I have carefully selected Strategic Sports Ltd to manufacture Morpher.They are the world’s leading OEM helmet manufacturer who are determined to make this a fantastically safe and effective product. They make helmets for most of the world’s leading brands.If you own a cycle helmet, the chances are that it’s one of theirs.They are an amazing company that treat their staff incredibly well. They provide homes, schooling, English lessons, food, sporting facilities, loads of international travel opportunities and a host of other benefits to those that are lucky enough to work there.There is a video explaining who they are and what they do at the bottom of this page.                                       Some years back, I was involved in an accident. I was hit by a car and thrown off my bike at pretty high speed. I flew through the air (stylishly) and landed head first on a kerb stone (a bit less stylishly). I broke my shoulder, smashed my chin, broke a couple of ribs... and if it wasn't for my helmet I would almost certainly have died... or been seriously brain damaged. As planet Earth gets greener and fitter we’re cycling more and more. More than a hundred cities around the world now have cycle rental schemes, which are proving to be hugely popular. But very few of us non bike owners are wearing helmets. According to research, the main reason is that they are simply too cumbersome to carry around all day, especially if you may only be taking a ten minute bike ride.   I noticed that on bike rental schemes, such as the ones in San Francisco, Boston, London,  Paris, Taipei, Shanghai, Bangkok and other cities, huge numbers of cyclists don't wear helmets. In London, for instance, well over 90% of renters don't wear one. I wanted to know why, so I commissioned a survey*. These were the results that we obtained:              *Survey results property of Jeffrey Woolf OBE © 2013So I realised I had a mission. If I could create a helmet that could fold flat… I could save lives, and so my journey began... It’s inevitable that as more people take to the road on a bicycle, more people will have accidents. When head meets road, vehicle or pavement without a helmet on it’s generally pretty messy… and sometimes fatal! My campaign is about encouraging helmet use by making them simpler to carry around when one isn’t actually on a bicycle. Help us protect the world, help get Morpher through the last stages of production.       Morpher has come a long way since its inception. The design has grown and changed radically, ideas have come and gone and now we're almost there. There are just a few more stages to complete before Morpher is ready to meet the world.  Moulding this helmet is extremely difficult as there are least 6 different materials and components involved. And they all have to be combined into one final moulding and assembly operation, which is incredibly challenging and has never been done before!(For those of you that want some more detail of how this all happens, see below or feel free to send me an email.) The funds are going towards passing rigorous international safety standards testing as well as finalising and building the incredibly complex tooling that is needed to produce Morpher. This means ensuring that the helmets get through the hugely onerous and thorough testing criteria to ensure that they pass all relevant safety standards. First for Europe and then for the USA and Australia (Our prototypes have already passed most European testing standards and we are on course to pass the more stringent US and Australian testing requirements).  THE MONEYThe funding will be used to cover the high costs of obtaining the certification and to get the manufacturing process working in an efficient and streamlined way, ready for mass production.  FAQs
1.  Shipping Costs: If you forgot to add shipping to your order then please Click Here, select ""No perk, I just want to contribute"", change the amount from the default $100 to the correct amount ($10 US, $15 UK or $20 Rest of World) & it will be matched to your order
2.  Shipping Addresses: Before we ship anything we’ll be emailing & asking you to confirm your address, so please don’t worry if you've moved since you ordered
3.  Colours: The first Morphers that we ship don’t have a colour choice. We’ve already polled you on some choices & I think they’ll be stunning. More about this as we get closer to May… It's looking likely that they'll be black (as shown under the ""What"" section, above) but this isn't yet guaranteed
4.  Size: Our first model has a fit system. This means you can adjust your Morpher to fit heads with a circumference of between 50.5 & 58cm. (19.8 to 22.7 inches. 6 1/8 to 7 1/8 UK hat sizes.) This covers a pretty wide range of heads from mid-teens to small ladies to medium+ men. Obviously, in the future, we'll produce a range of sizes including larger helmets & children's helmets.

<h3>Help us Free Pride</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>Last year
Glasgow Pride charged an entry fee to participate, and this year it is charging
even more, but not all LGBTQIA+ can afford this. The event lacks inclusiveness
for everyone in our LGBTQIA+ community with people feeling uncomfortable and
unsafe at the event. The event has lost its political edge and fails to meet
the needs of those in the community who need us to stand together and demand
change.

</p>
<p><span>The wholesale commercialisation of pride makes it clear that we
need an alternative- we're tired of being patronized and marketed to by large
companies, we're tired of having our histories pink-washed, we're tired of the
exclusion of trans, non-binary, disabled, poor, non-white and other
marginalised identities and we're tired of the real issues facing our community
being swept under the rug. </span></p>
<p>So this year we will be holding our own event. One that is not
commercialised. One that is inclusive. One that is a protest. We will be
freeing pride and we want you to join us!</p>

We’re all very excited to present a true Superhero Backpack and to see how you make use of its powers.There is a puzzle in our page: one can find some signs which are building a secret word up. If you managed to figure it out, please share your versions here.The smartest vagabonds will get a super-secret discount!Superhero backpack is your perfect urban buddy, which is both aesthetically pleasing and endlessly practical. Hard shell is water- and damage-resistant. For your IDs and plastic cards there are easily accessible pockets on one of the straps and facets. As a bonus, you can clip badges on the magnetic facet.We wanted everyone to feel comfortable when wearing Superhero backpack, so we’ve designed a breathable ergonomic back for the hottest days. In addition to that basic version of the backpack contains interior pockets for everything you might need: laptop, papers, water bottles, chargers, pens, keys. As a little superhero secret, we’ve also added two discreet exterior pockets which are easy to access without taking the backpack off.If basic version of the backpack is not enough for all your needs, we came up with interchangeable layers that have extra pockets for your gadgets, documents or a camera. They easily clip on and off and remain in place throughout the wildest adventures.For now we’re only shipping the basic model, but we’ll notify you once layers come out.

<p>My name is Jacy Jacobson and I am about to graduate from Western State College in Gunnison, Colorado. In December I will graduate and then travel to Africa with my boyfriend and his family. I am provided with the amazing opportunity to travel and see parts of the world that not many people will get the chance to visit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am graduating with an Art degree and have always enjoyed painting, drawing, and photographing the things that I see around me. I am hoping that this campaign will help me further promote and develop my art. I am very excited about the opportunity to sell my artwork and be able to travel and see more gorgeous and amazing things.  I know this will be an eye-opening experience that will present us both with possibilities and opportunities in and out of the field of art.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise money to support myself for 1 month in Africa, 3 months in Europe and still have a little bit to survive on when I arrive back home. If we do some quick math: With a successful campaign I will receive 96% of the final amount raised since IndieGoGo takes 4%. With $6,000 raised that leaves me at around $5,600 after fees and all. After paying for shipping to send all of you beautiful people your perks I am thinking I will be at around $5,000. With a budget of $250 a week for 16 weeks, that leaves me with a little extra for activities, site seeing, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What you get for contributing is up to you. As you can see on the right I have a lot of perks and most of them involve my artwork, from a calendar with my photos to a water color painting of a picture that I took on the trip. Help me make a living on what I love do to. Art.  You can also support our (Terry and Myself) love for the outdoors by claiming the perk-Slackline or Climb for a day!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to the campaign you are helping me develop, practice and build confidence for my artwork. Since a life without art is not much of a life at all, you are also encouraging me to fulfill my dream of incorporating art into all parts of this world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The biggest impact is helping me gauge how popular my artwork is, and how likely I am to be able to sell it once Terry and I get back to the US.  I know there will always be room for improvement and development so please let me know what you think.  Any and all comments and thoughts would be greatly appreciated!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t contribute due to funds, I completely understand. And there are other ways to help! Terry and I are still looking for places to stay on our route from Barcelona to France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and back to Paris. We are looking for free camping, cheap hostels and friends of friends that would be willing to have us stay for a few nights. Any information helps! </p></div>","Hello Everyone,

A: The duration of the “clinginess” is linked to many factors, including surface area, external environment, dust levels, and the texture of the wall. Funstatic stick for longer in dry, temperate, dust-free environments.

So make sure you dispose of it in the correct place.Most photos, posters and other wall decorations will often damage or leave marks on your walls, leaving you having to repair or repaint the walls later.People have tried several solutions over time but none of them were damage-free for their walls.Carefully printed on an innovative electrically charged film, the travel map can cling to any flat surface.It’s known that equal charges repel each other and different charges are attracted to one another.Due to the negative charge on the printed material and the positive charge on the wall, the map and photos can be easily applied without the need for harmful adhesives. Funstatic will be shipped worldwide. Here are the shipping costs:The team is composed of 3 engineers from Portugal who share the passion for product development and innovation.We decided to come up with this idea after one of us had to move apartments. During the process of moving, he discovered how frustrating it was to attach and detach the travel photos and posters without damaging the walls. Therefore, he ended up spending money on repairing the damage whilst still holding the risk of losing the rent deposit.We knew there had to be a better way.We put our minds together and we found several alternative materials, like magnetic paint, but they just weren't the answer we were looking for and none of them was necessarily fun and good enough to avoid wall damage.After learning about the electrostatic effects on a Polypropylene film, we decided to research further and design it in the shape of a world map.Why Indiegogo?Although this is not our first product, it is the first time we launch a campaign on Kickstarter.On every product we develop, we try to have the public validation before definitive producing, hence, reducing the risk.Also, we want to keep developing products alongside our customers. With your support, we can focus on what is important to you.For those reasons, we consider that Indiegogo is the ideal platform for us. Risks and challengesHaving made a successful prototype of our product, we know that the product works and we ready to make it with the same quality on a larger scale.However, it depends on the supply chain.

As most of you probably know, James and I were lucky enough to go to Nepal last year to trek to Everest base camp. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the earthquakes that hit Nepal this year have hurt many of the friends we made there. They are mostly from a region west of Kathmandu called Gorkha, which as you might have seen was the epicentre of the first quake. <br/><br/>The damage was pretty catastrophic. 90% of the buildings in the region were destroyed or seriously damaged. 43 employees of the company we trekked with have lost their homes. 35 schools were destroyed. The almost complete shutdown of the tourist industry meant the overwhelming majority have been out of work for almost 4 months. And that doesn't even mention the 64 loved ones that were killed and injured. For much of the last 3 months our friends and many others have been living in tents and surviving off charity handouts. This is not the beautiful Nepal we saw and fell in love with.<br/><br/>We thought we'd try and raise a bit of cash for them, so in the name of charity (and never having to do another leg day) we're looking to bike 250 miles from Manchester to Edinburgh. I hope I don't need to point out that this is a pretty massive mission, particularly given that one of us was in hospital having lung surgery 3 months ago! We're hoping to make it in 3 days, and promise to upload pics of every beautiful view, impressive sight, and emotional breakdown on the way.<br/><br/>We'd really appreciate it if you would consider donating. The money is going in part directly to the bank accounts of some of our friends there who've lost their homes, and in part to a charity called Sambhav Nepal. Sambhav means 'it's possible' in Nepalese. The charity was set up by the CEO of the trekking company we went with to improve the schools and education in Gorkha, although currently they are more focussed on just enabling the community to get back on its feet. In the 2 months after the earthquake they distributed almost 4000 aluminium sheets and 27,000 kg of rice to those in need. But much more is required.<br/><br/>If anyone wants more information on how the money will be used, please go to www.sambhavnepal.org to see details of their educational projects and ongoing relief work. We particularly recommend the videos.

<p></p>
<p>Hey, we’re Bren and Chad. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83411/files/20130919024157-Chad_and_Bren.jpeg?1379583717"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A little over two years ago, after moving from Australia to Spain (Chad) and the U.K. (Bren), and after having barely ridden a bike since we were kids, we decided to dust off our stack-hats and ride the length of Spain's Mediterranean coastline.</p>
<p>Would we make it? Would we hate it? Would be even still be brothers by the end of it?</p>
<p>Starting at the southern-most tip of the european continent, in Tarifa, we rode all the way along the spanish coast to the beautiful city of Barcelona.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83415/files/20130919024336-Spanish_Coast_Collage.jpeg?1379583816"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>21 days and 1,200km in total. And, you know what? We were HOOKED! </p>
<p>Later that year Bren took a ride from Brussels to Amsterdam. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83413/files/20130919024244-Brussels_to_Amsterdam.jpeg?1379583764"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Early in 2012, Chad popped over to Portugal and rode from Faro, back across the spanish border, to his home base in Málaga.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83414/files/20130919024314-Faro_to_Malaga.jpeg?1379583794"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Bren caught the bug again not long after, called in sick for a week at work, and cycled from Berlin down to Prague. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83416/files/20130919024357-Berlin_to_Prague.jpeg?1379583837"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In June 2012, we re-united again in Prague and continued the ride down through the Czech Republic into Austria and then over to Munich, in southern Germany. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83417/files/20130919024417-Prague_to_Munich.jpeg?1379583857"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>And this year, in preparation for our first official season of tours in 2014, we carried out a range of practice tours, complete with hired van, new bikes and, most importantly, guests.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/90614/files/20130923080623-Practice_Tours__1_.jpeg?1379948783"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout all of these trips, we've plotted the routes that we've ridden with one goal in mind; to open up the incredible experience of cycling across a country (or a continent!) to as many people as possible, from all around the world! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83426/files/20130919025011-Blue_Swash.jpeg?1379584211"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><span><strong>WHAT WE’RE DOING NOW</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Over the last two years, as well as getting some miles in our legs and some knowledge up our sleeves, we’ve also been planning the much-anticipated launch of Bike About Europe and our first ever season of tours in 2014! </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83418/files/20130919024440-What_we_re_doing_now.jpeg?1379583880"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>All the boring bits of registering the company, setting up bank accounts and organising insurance, have now been taken care of. We've launched our beautiful website with a full list of 2014 tours at: <a href=""http://www.bikeabouteurope.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>www.bikeabouteurope.com</b></a></p>
<p>And finally, we’ve put together a comprehensive business plan and we’ve worked out how much we’ll need to spend and when we’ll need to spend it, in order to be able to offer a range of incredible cycling holidays to guests from across the globe in 2014.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83427/files/20130919025033-Blue_Swash.jpeg?1379584233"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><span><strong>WHAT WE NEED NEXT</strong></span></h3>
<p>Obviously the cost of setting up this whole operation is going to be fairly extensive, however we are keen to keep the price of our tours as low as possible for our guests throughout our first year of operation.</p>
<p>By securing a bunch of support and early-bird bookings, we'll have the funds we need to purchase things like our Bike About Europe van, trailer and bicycle fleet. </p>
<p>With the right support for this campaign, we will be able to offer high-quality, fully-guided cycling holidays all across Europe, at the cheapest possible prices in 2014. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/83419/files/20130919024502-What_we_need_next.jpeg?1379583902"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We've set a modest Indiegogo goal in order to ensure that we receive as much of the funds raised through this campaign as possible. Indiegogo keeps just 4% if we reach our goal, however this jumps to 9% if we don't.</p>
<p>By contributing a small amount to the campaign, you'll be making a big difference to help us bring this fantastic form of travel to many more people over the next 12 months. </p>
<p>By making a larger contribution you can secure an unforgettable 2014 European Cycling Holiday at a significantly discounted rate (up to 40% off, depending on your contribution) and become one of the first people ever to sign up for an amazing Bike About Europe adventure.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>FUNDRAISING TARGETS</h3>
<p>This campaign is not so much about targets as it is about offering innovative perks and fantastic discounts to our earliest supporters. It's also about having access to the funds we need to keep our prices down throughout our first season of tours!</p>

Hey, we’re Bren and Chad. 








A little over two years ago, after moving from Australia to Spain (Chad) and the U.K. (Bren), and after having barely ridden a bike since we were kids, we decided to dust off our stack-hats and ride the length of Spain's Mediterranean coastline.
Would we make it? Would we hate it? Would be even still be brothers by the end of it?
Starting at the southern-most tip of the european continent, in Tarifa, we rode all the way along the spanish coast to the beautiful city of Barcelona.



21 days and 1,200km in total. And, you know what? We were HOOKED! 
Later that year Bren took a ride from Brussels to Amsterdam. 



Early in 2012, Chad popped over to Portugal and rode from Faro, back across the spanish border, to his home base in Málaga.



Bren caught the bug again not long after, called in sick for a week at work, and cycled from Berlin down to Prague. 



In June 2012, we re-united again in Prague and continued the ride down through the Czech Republic into Austria and then over to Munich, in southern Germany. 




And this year, in preparation for our first official season of tours in 2014, we carried out a range of practice tours, complete with hired van, new bikes and, most importantly, guests.






Throughout all of these trips, we've plotted the routes that we've ridden with one goal in mind; to open up the incredible experience of cycling across a country (or a continent!) to as many people as possible, from all around the world! 


WHAT WE’RE DOING NOW
Over the last two years, as well as getting some miles in our legs and some knowledge up our sleeves, we’ve also been planning the much-anticipated launch of Bike About Europe and our first ever season of tours in 2014! 



All the boring bits of registering the company, setting up bank accounts and organising insurance, have now been taken care of. We've launched our beautiful website with a full list of 2014 tours at: www.bikeabouteurope.com
And finally, we’ve put together a comprehensive business plan and we’ve worked out how much we’ll need to spend and when we’ll need to spend it, in order to be able to offer a range of incredible cycling holidays to guests from across the globe in 2014.



WHAT WE NEED NEXT
Obviously the cost of setting up this whole operation is going to be fairly extensive, however we are keen to keep the price of our tours as low as possible for our guests throughout our first year of operation.
By securing a bunch of support and early-bird bookings, we'll have the funds we need to purchase things like our Bike About Europe van, trailer and bicycle fleet. 
With the right support for this campaign, we will be able to offer high-quality, fully-guided cycling holidays all across Europe, at the cheapest possible prices in 2014. 





We've set a modest Indiegogo goal in order to ensure that we receive as much of the funds raised through this campaign as possible. Indiegogo keeps just 4% if we reach our goal, however this jumps to 9% if we don't.
By contributing a small amount to the campaign, you'll be making a big difference to help us bring this fantastic form of travel to many more people over the next 12 months. 
By making a larger contribution you can secure an unforgettable 2014 European Cycling Holiday at a significantly discounted rate (up to 40% off, depending on your contribution) and become one of the first people ever to sign up for an amazing Bike About Europe adventure.



FUNDRAISING TARGETS
This campaign is not so much about targets as it is about offering innovative perks and fantastic discounts to our earliest supporters. It's also about having access to the funds we need to keep our prices down throughout our first season of tours!
The graphic below gives you an idea of what we'll be able to purchase, based on varying levels of success throughout our campaign. 



As you can see, every pound, dollar, euro or yen that is donated will help to ensure that Bike About Europe gets off the the flying start that we're hoping for over the next 12 months!



OTHER WAYS TO HELP

We understand that not everyone can afford to make a financial donation to help us get Bike About Europe off the ground, but never fear; there are tons of other ways that you can help! Check out these ideas, for example:



Share the campaign: Use the social media links under our campaign video at the top of this page to share the campaign with friends and family.

Check out the live feed: Drop in to www.bikeabouteurope.com/indiegogo to see us cycling on our balcony in Spain throughout the duration of the campaign (1 October - 14 October, 2013).

Mention us to that friend with a blog: Any links back to the campaign are good news for us. If you happen to know somebody who works at a newspaper, writes articles online, or just seems to love sharing stuff with people they know, send 'em our way - we'd love to hear from them!


Check out our 2014 tours: You may not have your 2014 travel plans locked in yet and therefore don't want to commit to booking your holiday too early, however while you're sorting things out, feel free to visit www.bikeabouteurope.com to check out the available tours for 2014. Also, pass on the website details to friends and family who may be interested in a cycling holiday on their next European adventure!





£25+ PERK: BICYCLE KEYCHAIN BOTTLE OPENER
Most of our perks are fairly self-explanatory, however this one requires a few small photos to appreciate it's coolness! So, here they are:



This perk is included with every contribution of £25 or more, so please ensure to include your shipping address so that we can post this out to you at the end of the campaign. 
Note: International shipping of this item is included with all contributions of £25 or more.






IMPORTANT NOTE
By contributing to this campaign you are purchasing a voucher which is redeemable for the corresponding discount or number of tours which are applicable to your particular contribution, rather than purchasing a tour directly. The legal folks tell us that this is an important distinction, and will help to make sure that our discounts are as generous as possible!

<p><i>Mobilizing
Syrian Women Civil Defense</i></p>
<p>Hello my name is Lena and on February 14<sup>th </sup>2015 I
will attempt to reach the top of Mount Kilimanjaro— the highest mountain in
Africa and the tallest freestanding peak in the world.</p>
<p>I am climbing this 5,895 meter-high mountain for a cause that
is very personal to me. My every step up Kilimanjaro will be for Syria and for
my two elderly grandmothers there. As a Syrian American, I am not able to go inside
the country to help, but I am able to help young Syrian women like me who can.</p>
<p>These young women are the volunteers of the White Helmets
inside Syria. They are search-and-rescue workers and medics responding to
bombings and chemical attacks. Together we share a vision: to restore and
maintain hope in Syria. They work inside the country on the founding principles
of “impartiality, humanity and neutrality”, underpinning a promise to all
Syrians that the White Helmets are there to provide safety to everyone in a
time of need, regardless of what side of the conflict they stand. From now leading up to my climb in February, I am
asking for your support in joining the mission of raising awareness and saving lives
in Syria by helping these White Helmet volunteers. </p>
<p>Despite Syria being one of the most dangerous places on earth,
the White Helmets continue to operate and risk their lives to save others<i>.</i> Some days there are more than 50 bombs
and mortars that land in Syrian neighborhoods. Many of these bombs are rusty
barrels filled with nails and explosives, and sometimes are also filled with lethal
chemicals, that are dropped from helicopters onto homes, schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>The women volunteers are vital to saving lives during some of
these tragedies, especially the lives of women and girls. In the most conservative
areas of Syria, the communities and women themselves prefer being rescued by
other women. This is usually the case following major blasts where clothes are
ripped-off upon impact. Bare women have refused to be seen or even saved by
male volunteers from the White Helmets in their time of need.</p>
<p>For this reason
the White Helmets have led a campaign to bring more young women civil defenders
on board. Since September <b>35 young and courageous Syrian women</b> have been
trained in search-and-rescue and medical aid to save other women and men, and now,
there is a total of <b>56 women in Syria helping.</b> These women are already
saving lives, but are in need of some basic necessities to help them reach more
people. Currently, these women are in need of 6 ambulances in Syria. <b>YOU and
I </b>will attempt to provide them <b>ONE</b> of these ambulances for the cost ofUSD $15,000<b>.</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1159006/files/20150119065150-02f4cf9429829f63058a307b46668112078e2572a8d82bcd98e24bcf439db9c3.jpg?1421679110"" src="""" style=""width: 750.057471264368px; height: 421px;""/></p><br/>
<p>Having more women
as civil defenders— trained and on the streets of Syria – hits close to home
for me. With my conservative grandmothers inside Damascus, I want to know they
will be safe and rescued if they were in a time of need. Getting more Syrian
women involved in protecting and defending Syria, working alongside our Syrian
men, will shape the future of the country and the role of our women in it.  </p>
<p>With each
small step we take together, through donations or sharing this story, we are
closer to reaching the top of the mountain, whether its Mount Kilimanjaro, or
more so the challenge of helping Syrian White Helmet women save more lives and
restore the country.</p>

RideEasy doesn’t touch or rub against anything after it’s attached onto your binding. The cushioning of the ankle strap creates a clear gap between your boot and the strap. This is exactly where RideEasy attaches to. It takes advantage of this space to ""float"" beside your boot when you’re riding. It’s securely bolted on so it doesn’t rattle or shift as you go down the mountain. We’ve tested it extensively with pro-riders and snowboard instructors without any complaints. Here’s are clips of RideEasy going down the mountain to show that it doesn’t interfere with riding:<br/><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qsiyehxudzcg15l/AACDY2ihNdGOQbOyKn1DfzA_a?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qsiyehxudzcg15l/AACD...</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>How do you attach RideEasy to the binding?</strong></p><p>RideEasy attaches to your ankle strap at the inside of your front foot. After researching many possible binding areas, I found that this was the best spot to for RideEasy to take the weight of the whole board. There are 2 ways of attaching it to the inside of your ankle strap:</p><p>1) Bolting RideEasy directly onto the strap. If your ankle strap has holes to adjust the size of your ankle pad (e.g Burton) then you can use a screwdriver to remove the screw from the back of RideEasy and bolt it directly onto the strap.</p><p>2) Using our strap adapter: If your ankle strap doesn’t have holes, then take the ankle strap off the main frame of the binding, slide the strap adapter onto it, and then use a screwdriver to bolt RideEasy onto the strap adapter. The strap adapter works like a belt buckle. After you put the adapter on, you can bolt RideEasy onto it and then refit the ankle strap to your binding.</p><p>Both methods take a matter of minutes and require minimal tools. For a how to demonstration, check out our video below.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Does RideEasy fit all bindings?</strong></p><p>RideEasy will fit most bindings. We will deliver RideEasy to you with 2 strap adapters of different sizes. The largest adapter will fit 99% of straps in the market. If you are really unsure whether RideEasy will fit your binding, take a photo of the inside of your front binding with a tape measure beside the strap and send it to us at relaxed@rideeasy.co We will then tell you whether it fits or not.</p><p>P.S remember to also take a photo from the top, i.e. bird’s eye view, so we can see the thickness also.</p><p>As far as we know, the bindings that it will not work on are ""step-in"" bindings. This is because those don’t have an ankle strap, so there’s nothing for RideEasy to attach to. As long as you can detach the ankle pad from the binding’s main frame, you’ll be able to install RideEasy on your setup.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What if you forget to unhook from the chairlift?</strong></p><p>We spent 9 months working on the shape of the hook so that it only stays on the safety bar when there is weight on it. Taking the hook off is as easy as lifting your foot and then flicking it off. It literally takes a split second.

Save your leg for your best day of riding ever. RideEasy is a portable snowboard footrest that lets you hook your board on the chairlift so your leg can rest as you go up the mountain. It also doubles as a board lock that’s always on your binding so you never have to worry about leaving your board on the racks.   This easy-to-use footrest helps take the uncomfortable weight of the hanging board off your foot so you can chill on any chairlift. Without fatigue, ankle pain and numbness, you can maximize your shred time on the slopes.Decrease Knee/Ankle Stress - RideEasy decreases the weight of the board on the chairlift which reduces the risk of injury.   Extend Ride Time - RideEasy allows your legs to recover so you have energy to ride for longer.Protect Your Board - RideEasy doubles as lock so you never have to worry about your leaving your board on the racks.                                 Easy and Safe removal - Designed to effortlessly pull from the housing and retract back in no time.  Don’t worry about getting caught on the chairlift. A simple nudge of RideEasy’s hook off of the bar will send it auto retracting back into perfect place.  Remember - it retracts back in one second so you'll be ready to get off instantly. Reach down then lean back - Simple as that, pull to hook and let RideEasy do the work.  RideEasy was designed with you, the snowboarder, in mind. We want you to be able to get on and off the chairlift with the line as if nothing’s changed. When you want the chairlift to hold the board, simply reach down to grab the hook from your binding and put it on the safety bar. Anyone can do it, with a glove on, using just one hand.  Nudge and go - So easy that getting caught on the lift is a non-issue.    We spent more than 9 months on the shape of the hook so that it only stays on when the weight of your board is on it. Let’s say you've lost track chatting with your friends. Suddenly, the lift slows down and it’s time to get off. Simply nudge the hook off the safety bar, let it recoil back into place and cruise. Precise alignment every time - This auto alignment function sends the hook back into place instantly.    After the hook comes off the safety bar, it’s unsafe to have it dangling outside RideEasy's housing. That's why we have developed our own patented technology so that the hook will auto-align itself as it retracts into the housing within 1 second. You read that right. The hook retracts so fast that we had to slow it down for our video. After you flick the hook off the chairlift, you can forget about the line and ride off without any change in what you would normally do.       Built for all day riding - RideEasy supports your weight and stays secure while you're shredding.  We know a day out on the slopes means occasional spills and scratches. RideEasy was built to be a part of the snowboard lifestyle so you don’t have to tiptoe around with it. Secure Installation - Attach RideEasy to your binding and enjoy hassle free riding.  We have tested several materials to make sure that the line is able to withstand both the impact of snowboarding and the harsh conditions on the ski-slopes. Aside from vigorous testing in the lab, we've gone out to snow test prototypes extensively on the slopes of Niseko, Japan and Falls Creek, Australia. Our secure attachment keeps RideEasy locked in tightly against your boot, so it won't get knocked loose even if you take a hard fall. No rubbing against your boot or vibrating while riding. The solid plastic body and steel hook are snowproof and protect the insides from unwanted snow. Meanwhile, the auto retractable line itself has been tested hundreds of times to ensure it will always work, no matter the conditions. Zero drawbacks to riding - Unlike other board accessories and footrests, RideEasy is compact so it won’t change how your board rotates or tweaks. Weighing in at 99g and about the size of a pack of cards, you won't even realize that RideEasy has been on your binding all along. With a matte black finish, it blends into your gear perfectly. The auto retractable line keeps the hook close to you and out of your way after you've sat down on the lift. With no noticeable drawbacks to performance, RideEasy is the perfect snowboard accessory - always there, but only when you need it.   Supports your weight - This lean, mean, chilling machine was made for all snowboarders to enjoy a comfortable ride to the top.  We’ve talked to several material engineers to find the most suitable material for RideEasy. We finally settled on PC and POM, which, pound for pound is one of the strongest and most wear resistant materials available. We can report that the device can withstand 100 lbs of pulling force. With an average snowboard setup (board, binding + boots) weighing in at 13 lbs, we’ve built in an ample buffer for you to rest your leg without any problems.       Peace of mind on the racks - Know your board is safe when you’re grabbing drinks with friends.RideEasy doubles as a snowboard lock you’ll never leave behind since it’s already attached to your binding. A steel cable and combination code will protect your board when you treat yourself to lunch. For Any Board and Rack - RideEasy is just as agile when you’re using it to take a break.  RideEasy acts as a cable lock to protect your board when you’re not shredding. At 62 cm long, it can wrap around any rack out there. Once you place your board against the rack, simply wrap the lock around the rack and secure it with a combination code of your choosing. Removing the lock is also as simple as entering the right combination and letting the auto-retract feature unwind the board for you. Because it's always on your bindings, you won’t have to dig through your bag to find it, just go to the ankle strap! Simplify your accessories - The lock is not only safe, but easy to set and unlock.  Keys, gloves and snow are a horrible combination. Why mess around with tiny bits and pieces when our combination lock is just as secure? We've designed the dials to be large and rotate smoothly so you can enter the combination code with your gloves on. Our lock is one of the easiest to use on the slopes so you can drop the extra keys and stop losing lock pieces. Change it when you want  - Don’t stress over your code, you can update it at anytime.  Setting up the lock is incredibly straightforward. The combination reset button is situated behind the product with an intuitive slider that’s easy to use. Simply enter the current code, then slide the reset button across. Enter in your new code, then close the slider to lock it in. You're now ready to go!  RideEasy comes in 2 lengths. Which length is right for you?We know riders come in all different shapes and sizes, that’s why we made an extended length option for those of you who are taller. Check out our recommendations below!My height is:5’9 (170 cm) and under - Select the Normal Length5’9+ - Select the Extended Length             Hi there, I'm Adrian, the creator of RideEasy. That's me, chilling on the chairlift in the photo above. But it wasn't always that way…The idea started 4 years ago, back to the slopes of Hanazono, Niseko in Japan. Every time I had to go to the top of the mountain, it took 3 lifts of 6-7 minutes each.Here's the problem:3 lifts to the summit x 6-7 minute rides x 0 footrests = painYou better believe that my front leg was numb and sore by the time I got to the top. And to do it all over again, 10-15 times a day? That was when RideEasy was born.Back to the present. What started out as a 2 dollar bungee cord and hook, is now complete and ready to be used in action. Me and my team of engineers and designers are proud to have put together an accessory that will not only help you ride higher and for longer, but is durable, lightweight and portable. When I'm not working on RideEasy or hitting the slopes, you can find me spending time with my boy Asher.      You’re a business professional and this is your hobby: Perfect for your next week long snowboard trip to Park City. Maybe you live a hectic life in finance or sales and often travel to unwind from it over the weekend. RideEasy is the perfect accessory to help you recharge throughout the day and avoid early knee/back problems from appearing. If it makes vacation a little bit better, you’re willing to spend for comfort.You’re a thrill seeker: Perfect for the younger, late 20's-mid 30's performance driven snowboarder. You’re like Adrian, RideEasy’s creator, still near your “peak” physically, and love to challenge yourself with new limits - black slopes, faster times, backcountry runs. RideEasy will reduce fatigue on the chairlift and help you ski harder down the slope, every time. Since you don't want anything affecting your performance, it's key that RideEasy is compact and lightweight.You’re thoughtful: The perfect gift for those who want to surprise their significant other with a new alternative to numb legs from the chairlift. RideEasy would be a great gift for your girlfriend who mentions how uncomfortable the lift is because of her sore legs. It’s also a great gift for your Mom or Dad, who have old injuries that get irritated with board strain. Don't let chairlift rides ruin your trip. Get RideEasy and enjoy your ride to the top in peace.

      Shouldn't RideEasy go on the back binding?During our testing, we tried to put RideEasy on the back binding. We found two problems:
With the REL on the back binding, it will only take 50% of the weight of the board because the other half will be support by your front/attached leg.
With the back of the board hooked onto the safety bar, it will be parallel to the chairlift which will interfere the people sitting beside you on the lift.
Since we’ve designed RideEasy to be shorter than your front leg, this video shows that the line will take most of the weight of your board and your leg will be able to rest!  But you can just put your board onto your boot... That's what I've been doing for 10 years, but the sharp edge would cut the toe box of my boot. I came up with the product not because I couldn't stand the pain of the hanging board, but to rest up on the chairlift ride so I can shred harder. Might as well make good use of the time we’re on the lift when we aren’t doing anything anyways!  How much weight can RideEasy take? Is it easy to break?We’ve tested RideEasy to carry 100lb. With an average snowboard setup (board, binding and boots) weighing in at 18lbs, we’ve built in an ample buffer for you to rest your leg on without any problems. You can even kick your leg around on the chairlift and RideEasy will be able to withstand the strain you put on it. Check out the video below for a behind the scenes look at our strength testing!  Will the REL interfere with my riding?Nope! RideEasy doesn’t touch or rub against anything after it’s attached onto your binding. The cushioning of the ankle strap creates a clear gap between your boot and the strap. This is exactly where RideEasy attaches to. It takes advantage of this space to ""float"" beside your boot when you’re riding. It’s securely bolted on so it doesn’t rattle or shift as you go down the mountain. We’ve tested it extensively with pro-riders and snowboard instructors without any complaints. Here’s are clips of RideEasy going down the mountain to show that it doesn’t interfere with riding:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qsiyehxudzcg15l/AACD... How do you attach RideEasy to the binding?RideEasy attaches to your ankle strap at the inside of your front foot. After researching many possible binding areas, I found that this was the best spot to for RideEasy to take the weight of the whole board. There are 2 ways of attaching it to the inside of your ankle strap:1) Bolting RideEasy directly onto the strap. If your ankle strap has holes to adjust the size of your ankle pad (e.g Burton) then you can use a screwdriver to remove the screw from the back of RideEasy and bolt it directly onto the strap.2) Using our strap adapter: If your ankle strap doesn’t have holes, then take the ankle strap off the main frame of the binding, slide the strap adapter onto it, and then use a screwdriver to bolt RideEasy onto the strap adapter. The strap adapter works like a belt buckle. After you put the adapter on, you can bolt RideEasy onto it and then refit the ankle strap to your binding.Both methods take a matter of minutes and require minimal tools. For a how to demonstration, check out our video below. Does RideEasy fit all bindings?RideEasy will fit most bindings. We will deliver RideEasy to you with 2 strap adapters of different sizes. The largest adapter will fit 99% of straps in the market. If you are really unsure whether RideEasy will fit your binding, take a photo of the inside of your front binding with a tape measure beside the strap and send it to us at relaxed@rideeasy.co We will then tell you whether it fits or not.P.S remember to also take a photo from the top, i.e. bird’s eye view, so we can see the thickness also.As far as we know, the bindings that it will not work on are ""step-in"" bindings. This is because those don’t have an ankle strap, so there’s nothing for RideEasy to attach to. As long as you can detach the ankle pad from the binding’s main frame, you’ll be able to install RideEasy on your setup. What if you forget to unhook from the chairlift?We spent 9 months working on the shape of the hook so that it only stays on the safety bar when there is weight on it. Taking the hook off is as easy as lifting your foot and then flicking it off. It literally takes a split second. If you don’t believe me, check out it out here: https://youtu.be/jogpKLiHqh8 How much does RideEasy weigh?The product weights in at 99 grams or 0.22 lbs. That’s only 1/3 of the weight of an iPhone 8. Because it’s attached to your binding, which is attached to your board and on the ground most of the time, you won’t be able to feel the weight of RideEasy at all. How long is the cable?We were thinking about chairlift footrests when we built RideEasy. Those metal footrests aren’t adjustable so we weren’t too worried about needing to adjust RideEasy’s length. Having the comfort of the rider in mind however, we made two sizes for RideEasy: Normal Length, which is 57cm long and Extended Length which is 62cm long.If you’re shorter than 5’9"" then get the normal length. Anything above that, get the extended length. If in doubt, get the normal length, as the worse case scenario is that your knee will be bent just a little bit more with the slightly shorter cable, but RideEasy will still be taking all the weight of the board off your leg. Will this work on safety bars that have advertisements/resort maps on them?We know that advertisements sometimes cover the bar, and are too large for RideEasy to hook onto. Fortunately, they never cover the entirety of the bar, and there'll always be space to hook your line. It won’t hook onto the advertisements or resorts maps, but you can put the hook on the part of the safety bar right beside them. Can you change the combination lock code for RideEasy?Yes, we built a combination lock reset button into the back of RideEasy so you can set the unlock code to whatever 3 digit number you want.  When will my RideEasy be delivered?Being snowboarders ourselves, we know that the season is almost here and that you want to get RideEasy this season. We have been working extremely hard to line up all the different factories and people necessary for our production. Keeping all the prep work in mind, we promise to deliver by June 2018. How will my RideEasy be shipped?All units will be shipped by a professional logistics company specializing in fulfillment for crowdfunding campaigns. What is the Warranty?We provide a 1 year limited warranty. We guarantee you will receive your RideEasy free of manufacturing defects. We will have 100% AQL inspection levels to ensure quality. Can I change or cancel my perk?Indiegogo have now made it easier than ever to upgrade your perks.

Oh, and we’ve managed to make it even. more. affordable.   We didn’t just create a tent. We created an outdoor sleeping system that combines the best and most durable elements of our camping gear into one high-quality, heavy-duty, lightweight (6.2 lbs / 2.8 kg) superpack.      Thanks to RhinoWolf’s modular design, you can connect your RhinoWolf to your friend’s RhinoWolf, to her spouse’s Rhinowolf, to that guy’s friend’s RhinoWolf to… You get the picture. No need to worry about rain, sunlight or wind leaking through because we’ve added the innovative “roll and lock” feature. Simply zip the tents together, roll the extra fabric and use the loops to lock your RhinoWolfs together. 1. Zip the tents together and tightly roll down the excess fabric2. Stick the peg through the loop3. Lock it in   We'll contact you after the campaign is over for your color choice. Choose between pink, light green and dark green.  RhinoWolf 2.0 was created with the toughest and most durable of climate protective materials. And with even more integrative and customizable features, this SuperTent is totally full-spectrum. The shell is made of premium polyester and the tent is wind proof and is durable to up to 2000 ml of rain.Need a spot for your bags and other equipment? We thought of that too. Unroll the two attachable flaps for added storage space. Or just one for an extra shaded area.    The air mattress is lightweight, supportive, comfortable, and inflates super easily with our pump sack. It has an insulation R-value of 1.3, and it’s made of polyester, making it strong and flexible.  Our sleeping bags aren’t actually sleeping bags. They’re super comfy blankets that zip right onto the bottom of the tent creating a snug pocket to cozy up in. They come in two variations:Standard: weighs 150g | made of synthetic fibers | cold temperature limit of 59°F / 15°CDown: weighs 375g | made of duck down | cold temperature limit of 40°F / 10°C  Because there’s nothing better than taking in fresh air when you’re outdoors. In RhinoWolf 2.0, we’ve added two air vents for improved air flow while you relax in your SuperTent.       Our innovative 1-Pole frame makes for a faster set up in RhinoWolf 2.0.

This portable power bank can fully charge your phone at least twice and a bit more for sure. Its 5V 2A output for your smartphones will fast charge both android and ios phones no prob. In addition, it can kick start your car when your car battery is out through its 12V output.</p><p>With Sol-Mat, you can fully charge this power bank in less than 3 hours under 1 sun condition (which means more or less sunlight at 11am ~ 1 pm in perfect day condition).  So if you go out and have lunch picnic on Sol-Mat, then V8000 will also eat sunlight and be full when you get full :P</p><p>Plus! it has 4 indicator lights so you check the fullness</p><p>More so, unlike other power bank, V8000 has On-Off switch which prevents natural discharge. Therefore, if you want to charge your phone, link it to V8000 and press the switch. After using it, unlink your phone and V8000 will automatically cut off its electricity supply and prevent natural loss.</p><p>V8000 also comes in 3 colors so have fun choosing them!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486975886/io2zbha7wei4kxg4dziu.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486975980/w4xzfifh3jfnvelgzrhd.png"" src="""" style=""width: 289px;height: 260px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486975992/y6axpmhezb5hckkiwp91.png"" src="""" style=""width: 284px;height: 259px;""/></p><p> </p><p align=""left""><strong>What we guarantee in this campaign</strong></p><ol>

</div></div>","The Idea:
 We set out to enhance bike riding experience without introducing any drawbacks; the result was LightWheel, now our goal is to share the development with You!
 LightWheel comes in to play when the lighting conditions worsen and makes you and your bike more visible than in direct sunlight!
Benefits:


makes you and your bike visible from any distance during dark hours

can charge any mobile device while on the go (including iPhone and Android devices)
gives you and your bike a unique look

Affordable to enyone! (target selling price will be below 50$)
Details:
Comprising of

a special self adhesive film
active black light emitters (LEDs one for each side of the wheel)
USB power source that powers the emitters and can charge any mobile device
All Things Considered:


It's simple reliable and elegant
Does not rob you or your bike of power 
Does not introduce additional drag
Weights as much as an empty drink bottle



LightPack - The heart of LightWheel:
 At the heart of LightWheel is a unique USB power source that does more things than one:

Has capacity of 3000mAh (can last for weeks)
Can Charge any mobile device that supports USB charging
Can be Recharged from any powered USB source
Portable and Light (take it anywhere, trips, vacations, etc.)

 

What We Need & What You Get
 We have two prototype LightWheel equipped bikes, that are being used for testing, but we require more people to participate ang give us feedback on how we can improve this product.
 We need work out manufacturing issues which depend on the scale of this project and level of interest, and we want to make it affordable for everyone!
 If we reach our goal of 12.000$ we can approach a competitive price of 35$ + shipping cost for the complete kit!
Short Term Goals:

Create a gallery and a promotional video for the product (rent video equipment as cheap cameras are not capable of capturing blur free images in low light conditions) 
Create an online shop through which we will sel and support the product worldwide




The Impact
 Help us succeed and bring this project to life. Be a part of making our society healthier more active and safer!

<p>why are you doing this? you're 70-years-old, what are you trying to prove? what is on your mind? are you reaching for some goal? </p>
<p>often i am asked these questions by people who know and luv me; other people who know nothing about me; people who meet me on the road and seeing me astride <i>transporter, know</i> that i’m going somewhere, and stop to question. all these are good people curious to know why a 70-year-old blackman of meagre means is on a motorcycle with a plan of traveling 12-18 months to every one of the lower 48 states ––and in asking, they expect an answer, some word around which they mite wrap their own life experience. simply, they are searching for some way to see me in their measure of time and space. but unapologetically, i have no answer for them. i no longer even attempt to fashion answers that will alleviate curiosity, concern, consternation, angst or envy. i am very simply on the road to learn why i am on the road. </p>
<p>i've called this a rootfolks freedom ride: a sojourn across america to locate the consciousness of liberation among afrikan people –– and, most appropriately, that search begins with my self. while i have faced down and walked away from death row, i know death is always at hand, at my age it is palpably a lot closer. this ride is not a bucketlist item, far from it, it is an inspiration from my ancestors rooted in my core experience. the ancestors have invited me to this quest, and honored, i accepted their offering without question, knowing that simply engaging the opportunity will make me more human.</p>
<p>some would say the point of being human is to accept the responsibility to question, for in the question lies the path to learning, and thru learning one knows how to apply the knowledge that living simply opens. i have no argument with that, and during my years there have been times when i have followed this rational course. not now. but if that course is what you have chosen, i salute you; but here, now, that approach does not work for me ––and i find too much thinking to be a vexation of spirit. i choose the road of intuition. the opinion of the other, while considered, is not required. </p>
<p>of course, my safety is the principal concern of the people who luv me. i acknowledge and appreciate their concern. after all, i am an aging afrikanman, blind in one eye, traveling across a country that again and again has proven its hatred of the afrikan presence in its midst. my people are afraid i may have gone crazy; that i may be trying to commit suicide, or that i am</p><p></p><p>delusional, thinking i have powers i could not possibly possess. be assured, i am not insane. i am not doing today what i did yesterday and expecting a change to come. i am simply living, or said more accurately, living simply. i know that all i have is rite now. tomorrow, i may not have eyes to navigate the road,  or even be among the living. rite now is when i can experience this land and its people. i want to see and find relationship and so. . . .</p>

<h3>Temple Israel of Long Beach was the very first Synagogue opened on the South Shore Barrier Island and dates back to 1920. With one of the largest physical facilities, it seems to have suffered the most extensive damages from the storm. The three building complex had its entire lower level completely compromised and under 10 feet of water. The Synagogue lost 6 Sifrei Torah, which have been certified totally irreparable. The lower level included a daily chapel, fully stocked Judaic library, conference room, 4 religious school classrooms, computer lab, social hall, 2 sets of bathrooms, youth lounge, dairy kitchen and full utility room including boilers,  air conditioning equipment and electric service. The Synagogue still remains without any basic services, heat or electric and just held Shabbat services for the first time since the storm, with the use of a generator and temporary heating. The membership is largely displaced and scattered, as far away as Florida, with many not sure when they will be able to return to their homes.</h3>

<h2>Young people are our future!</h2>
<p>Polish-Japanese Friendship Foundation NAMI is NGO (non-goverment organization), founded in 2013 in Wroclaw, Poland. Since we formed, we have organized many Japanese-culture events and invited famous Japanese artists. We manage our constant activities, which let young people meet Japanese culture. We organize  kendo lessons in Ryushinkai club, where we established a special group for children. We do Japanese language lessons for Polish people and many more. </p>
<p>This year one of our biggest events that we organize is Nami Kendo Taikai. It is the third edition of the International tournament, which gather lot of people from all around Europe. Taikai is the event which gives a good chance to meet people from another countries, challenge their kendo skills and gain more knowledge about kendo.  NAMI Foundation always try to create something new, which may give possibility to meet Japanese culture and develop relationships between Japan and other nations. Therefore, we set up an extraordinary prize for the winner, whose age is between 18 and 26 years old. This prize is the one week stay in Tokyo, in purpose to practice kendo in police kendo dojo with sensei Sugawara Tadanori (7 dan kendo kyoshi). Fixed term of visitation in Japan, is around 15th of Janurary 2018. </p>
<p>Why the winner should travel so far? Because Japan is the homeland of kendo and practicing there gives the best chance to develop kendo skills. For young kendoka such long distance travel is often beyond financial possibilities. That is why we decided to establish this trip as the main prize in NAMI Taikai and we hope you can support us in that project.</p>
<p>This is a big project for non-profit organisation that is why we count on your support and do believe that together we will succeed!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The budget of our project is 1800$. We collect funds to cover the costs of round trip ticket from Warsaw to Tokyo and for the accomodation in Japan. We established this budget according to our current experience of traveling to Japan. We hope all of you will understand and accept this one.  </p>
<p>Remember that we prepare special items for our donators! Please donate and choose the one that is most interesting and unique for you. Our gifts are mostly related to NAMI Foundation and Ryushinkai Kendo Dojo. They will be a visible sign of both: your support and our gratitude. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As we already mentioned, young people are our future. We do believe that this kind of prize will open young people for other culture and broaden their horizons. This will let to maintain a long term relationship with Japanese culture and spread the knowledge about this beutiful country.</p>
<p>As this is strictly related to the way of sword – Kendo we do think that through the practice young people can obtain the main values which are brought into life with this discipline.</p>
<p>These aspects were defined by All Japan Kendo Federation in 1975:</p>
<p>""To mold the mind and body""</p>
<p>""To cultivate a vigorous spirit""</p>
<p> ""To hold in esteem human courtesy and honor""</p>
<p> ""To associate with others with sincerity""</p>

<p>Opening up a business is fun and exciting. And it’s even more fun and more exciting when you can share it with friends and family. Our business is still in its infancy stage so we want to offer you our Baby Llama VIP packages. We think it’s a great way to raise some capital while extending discounts and fun perks to our friends and family. And you know what, feel free to go ahead and tell all your friends and families too. </p>
<p>We have been working nonstop over the last 6 months to make this hostel a reality. And it is getting closer and closer by the day. The logistics and unexpected costs have started to add up a bit. The money generated from this campaign will be used to put the final touches on everything and help us create the exact space we have envisioned. </p>
<p>There are only a few specific things we’re lacking that would really complete the hostel. We would love to have a new audio system and new tables and furniture for the bar and lounge. The old stereo system can’t handle another dance party and the poor furniture that was left behind has been sat on one too many times. These small but major things will make all the difference to the look and vibe of the hostel. If you want to help us and know you’re not likely to use one of our discounted packages, we’ve added an option for you to donate specifically to these items.</p>
<p>There is no way to thank you enough for purchasing one of these packages or donating to us. We will be forever grateful.</p>
<p>Take the time you need to make travel plans. All offers above are good through the end of 2022. </p>
<p>Come join us and turn our adventure into your adventure. We can’t wait to see you!!</p>

We have been working nonstop over the last 6 months to make this hostel a reality. And it is getting closer and closer by the day. The logistics and unexpected costs have started to add up a bit. The money generated from this campaign will be used to put the final touches on everything and help us create the exact space we have envisioned. 
There are only a few specific things we’re lacking that would really complete the hostel. We would love to have a new audio system and new tables and furniture for the bar and lounge. The old stereo system can’t handle another dance party and the poor furniture that was left behind has been sat on one too many times. These small but major things will make all the difference to the look and vibe of the hostel. If you want to help us and know you’re not likely to use one of our discounted packages, we’ve added an option for you to donate specifically to these items.
There is no way to thank you enough for purchasing one of these packages or donating to us. We will be forever grateful.
Take the time you need to make travel plans. All offers above are good through the end of 2022. 
Come join us and turn our adventure into your adventure. We can’t wait to see you!!

<h3>About us and our expedition</h3>
<p>We are a 4 person team from Poland, which is planning a freeride trip to Indian Himalayas in August of current year.</p>
<p>We have already been in Atlas in Morocco, on the volcanoes in Mexico and in Georgian Caucasus. We have visited Carpathian Mountains, Swiss Alps and Spanish Sierra Nevada. However, it is still not enough for us. We want to ride in places where no one has ridden before, in places where the trails end and go far beyond the limits of our endurance.</p>
<p>This year, we are planning to conduct a bike-exploration of the Himalayan region of Ladakh to find some spots for freeride. Our main goal is reaching the summit of Chamser Kangri (6622m above sea level) and an attempt of downhill from the top of it. Most probably it will be a record of the highest summit fully ridden down on a mountain bike.</p>
<p><img alt=""Chamser Kangri"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1484392/ladakh_g.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p><em>View on the Tso Moriri lake and Chamser Kangri on the left (photo:Paweł Goleman)</em></p>
<p>It will be the real freeride without compromises. We will redefine the boundaries of high mountain riding. We will show that freeride is not limited by altitude or rough terrain. We will prove that bike is not only fun. It is a challenge and a dream.</p>

<h4>Hello, my name is Aaron Overstreet. Thank you for taking the time to view my Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for my trip to India.</h4>
<h4>I work in the Holistic Healing field as a Certified Breathworker. The style of breathwork I teach is called ""Rebirthing"". I have been practicing Rebirthing-Breathwork for over 20 years. For me it has become more than just a career. It has become my passion and a way of life. To learn more about Rebirthing please visit my website <a href=""http://www.rebirthingbreathwork.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rebirthingbreathworkpdx.com</a> or visit the website for Rebirthing Breathwork International <a href=""http://www.rebirthingbreathwork.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rebirthingbreathwork.com</a>
</h4>
<h4>Rebirthing-Breathwork was founded by a man named Leonard Orr.  Leonard is my teacher, mentor and friend. The trip that I am requesting funding for is a four week adventure led by Leonard in northern India. The trip begins with a 9 day Rebirthing-Breathwork/Spiritual Purification training in Chandigarh, which those of us traveling with Leonard will be helping to facilitate.</h4>
<h4>In addition to the 9 day training we will be visiting holy sites and the ashram of my and Leonard's guru Haidakhan Babaji. I've felt a strong connection to Babaji even before my involvement in Rebirthing-Breathwork, which makes this trip a special opportunity for me. Babaji's energy and presence has always been a guiding force behind the Rebirthing-Breathwork movement. <br/>
</h4>
<h4>This trip will benefit me personally as well as my work as a Breathworker. I believe that visiting the land where the practices I teach originated will deepen and expand what I am able to offer to others.</h4>
<h4>I have my plane tickets and I am committed to the trip. The funds that I am campaigning for will go towards guide fees, transportation, food and lodging and any unexpected expenses. Funds will also help with the expenses of bills to be paid at home during my absence.<br/>
</h4>
<h4>I wanted to wait to launch this fundraising campaign until I had my plane tickets. It will be a short campaign and will run for about two weeks in order for me to receive the funds before leaving.</h4>
<h4>Your help is greatly appreciated and to thank you for your contributions I am offering special gifts. For a $900 contribution I am offering 10 Rebirthing sessions and a Personal Law Consultation. For a $108 contribution I am offering a Rebirthing session. And for a $40 contribution I am offering a Personal Law Consultation. The Rebirthing sessions will need to be redeemed in person and scheduled after I return on Oct 22nd. The Personal Law Consultation can be done in person, over the phone or via skype, also scheduled after I return.<br/>
</h4>
<h4>Any amount helps. This campaign is designed so that I receive all contributions whether or not I reach my goal. You can also help by sharing this campaign with others.<br/>
</h4>
<h4>Thank you for your time and contributions!<br/>
</h4>
<h4>You are helping to enrich my life which in turn will enrich what I am able to offer others.</h4>

COWAROBOT R1 features futuristic technology that bring it to life, like the CO-EYE depth sensor, CO-MOVE autonomous following system, and CO-SMART intelligent locks. The technology was developed to allow the R1 to “see” the world around it, “think” of the best way to get there and “walk” to its destination, while keeping your valuables safe at all times. 

 
CO-MOVE system is the brains of the R1, in charge of sensing the environment, planning reasonable paths, and obstacle avoidance, all while following its user. 
 

 
The sensing ability of the CO-MOVE system is made possible by:
●   Multi-sensor fusion technology, which is mainly based on a set of sonars
●   A depth sensor CO-EYE
●  Cliff Detect sensors that allow R1 to avoid stairs and other dangerous drop-offs
 

A pair of active wheel units drives the R1
●  Navigates the path according to the data received from the sensing system.
●  When the Autonomous Mode is disabled, the active wheels will retract, similar to an airplane landing gear.

 




CO-SMART intelligent Lock features an ergonomic design for comfort and syncs with a bracelet that acts like a keyless remote.
●  The on-board LED lights on the lock tell you whether the suitcase is locked or open.
●  Integrates a TSA lock and a traditional combination lock
●  Specially designed to be opened effortlessly by you through simply twisting the R1’s main compartment lock. 
 

                                           
 

●  All-aluminum frame and 100% German Bayer polycarbonate
●  Top notch construction quality
●  Modular design for convenience and space
●  Ergonomic handle with sensors
●  Ultra quiet wheels
●  Miniaturized electronic components
 

 
We have done numerous tests on the R1 to ensure that quality and build will last you on your many adventures. We've smashed it, rolled it over rugged terrain, threw it repeatedly against the ground, and stressed each and every component in order to test its resilience and construction quality.
 


 

We will be contacting all R1 owners before the delivery date, for you to choose your favorite color.
Whether you are purchasing the R1 for yourself or a friend, we want to make sure you are receiving the best product possible.

With PowerSiesta you'll sleep better, deeper, and longer without back or neck strain – so you can arrive at your destination feeling refreshed and ready to go!PowerSiesta is eco-friendly, lightweight, and easy to use.

Embark on your adventure well-rested and refreshed!Because sleeping while traveling shouldn’t be a nightmare! Aren’t you tired of sleeping on planes with your head flopped back and your mouth wide open? Of waking up with your face buried deep into a stranger’s shoulder? Aren’t you tired of arriving at your destination TIRED and aching all over from uncomfortable sleep? Of course you are – and so are your fellow passengers!Say no to uncomfortable, embarrassing sleeping positions wreaking havoc on your wellbeing – and just say sí to PowerSiesta! PowerSiesta lets you sleep (almost) wherever, and whenever you like, in unparalleled comfort. The sturdy, ergonomically-designed PowerSiesta ensures you get the high-quality sleep you need, so you can relax completely and arrive at your destination looking fresh as a daisy, and feeling like a million bucks. Designed by travelers for travelers, PowerSiesta has worried about all the technical bits – so you can just focus on having an awesome nap.Your PowerSiesta nap set includes the washable, ultra-compact and comfy slide-on PowerSiesta pillow that makes napping on the go even more comfortable! 
 
When simply looking at PowerSiesta for the first time, some doubt its ability to support high-quality sleep. But after trying it out, users’ feedback has all been the same: that the PowerSiesta napper is an incredibly comfortable tool they would happily add to their travel essentials.
  Get the sleep of your dreams — no matter how you choose to get there. PowerSiesta can be used in various ways depending on your mode of transportation and preference. From commuting train journeys to long haul flights – wherever you go, PowerSiesta is ready to come along with you. PowerSiesta napper is the simple, lightweight, and affordable solution for comfortable napping on the go. Ergonomically designed to allow your head to rest at a natural angle, PowerSiesta protects your neck and shoulders from unnecessary strain and damage. When not in use, the lightweight PowerSiesta is the size of a magazine, easy to take with you wherever you go. Then, when it’s time for another siesta, it pops open in seconds.Other solutions are not only uncomfortable, embarrassing and bulky, but many are also made with materials that have a negative impact on the environment. Typical neck pillows are usually made with PET synthetic stuffing; polyurethane memory foam that can emit VOCs and other harmful chemicals; or polystyrene microbeads that are notoriously slow to biodegrade.PowerSiesta is the comfortable, easy-to-clean, and environmentally friendly alternative that you can use over and over again – a welcome change from old-fashioned plastic pillows or dorky inflatable doodads. It's is made from high-grade corrugated cardboard which is durable enough to be used over and over and resists stains thanks to its smooth finish, but still 100% recyclable. Can’t wait to get snoozing on the go in comfort? Then join us and get your hands (and head) on your very own PowerSiesta nap set – we’ve got all your power nap needs covered.Whether you want one just for yourself, or share the gift of good napping with friends and family, we’ll have a reward to fit you like a pair of snug pajamas.

<h1><b>Climbing IS For You!</b></h1>
<p><b>Stonetree
Climbing Center is a cutting edge, one-of-a-kind bouldering gym that
incorporates innovative climbing trends that are safe, family friendly and
accessible to people of all climbing abilities. </b></p>
<p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing
that is performed without the use of ropes.  As a sport, bouldering builds
strength and pushes physical limits.  On an interpersonal level it builds
confidence, communication, determination, and trust. </p>
<p><i>All
those benefits while having fun -Climbing <b>is</b>
for everyone!</i></p>
<p>For our families, Stonetree is a
realized dream that gives us an opportunity to enjoy and to share our passion
of rock climbing.  With Helena being surrounded by beautiful outdoor
spaces with amazing rock to climb, it is challenging to contain the desire to
enjoy that during long Montana winters.  And as families with young
children, their energy is challenging to contain indoors, and why should
it be contained.  There are no other indoor climbing
facilities within 100 miles of Helena.  Stonetree will bridge that gap by
creating an indoor space where outdoor enthusiasts and energetic children can
recreate year round.</p>
<p>This space has the climbing community
excited, our vision is broaden this excitement and to provide an alternative form of recreation

Bushillas-Zach, Tiffany and the girls.  Zach is a Helena native who has been
climbing in and around Montana for the past 20 years.  He has been the
coach for the local Helena Thunder Chickens rock climbing team, who are equally
as excited to have a space to train and to be out of the Bushilla garage
gym.  As president of the Helena Recreation Foundation Zach was
instrumental in bringing the outdoor boulder to Centennial Park and sees
Stonetree as another way to bring climbing to the Helena Community. 
Tiffany has lived in Helena the past 10 years, originally from the Chicago
area.  As a native flatlander, Tiffany enjoys spending time in the Montana
outdoors making sure Zach and the girls have a good spotter while
climbing.  As a stay-at-home mom for the past five years, Tiffany is
thrilled to have an indoor space that will allow families with children to
climb, explore and celebrate boundless energy.   The girls are a driving
force of this project; their love of climbing and adventure has helped
build this dream.

Stonetree
Climbing Center is a cutting edge, one-of-a-kind bouldering gym that
incorporates innovative climbing trends that are safe, family friendly and
accessible to people of all climbing abilities. 
Bouldering is a form of rock climbing
that is performed without the use of ropes.  As a sport, bouldering builds
strength and pushes physical limits.  On an interpersonal level it builds
confidence, communication, determination, and trust. 
All
those benefits while having fun -Climbing is
for everyone!
For our families, Stonetree is a
realized dream that gives us an opportunity to enjoy and to share our passion
of rock climbing.  With Helena being surrounded by beautiful outdoor
spaces with amazing rock to climb, it is challenging to contain the desire to
enjoy that during long Montana winters.  And as families with young
children, their energy is challenging to contain indoors, and why should
it be contained.  There are no other indoor climbing
facilities within 100 miles of Helena.  Stonetree will bridge that gap by
creating an indoor space where outdoor enthusiasts and energetic children can
recreate year round.
This space has the climbing community
excited, our vision is broaden this excitement and to provide an alternative form of recreation
for the Helena community-families, teens, college students, working professionals-you!

<p>My main objective is the upgrade to dog transport ( 2006 trailblazer already purchased for this project. It is very low miles,  comfortable for dogs of various sizes.) and  marketing to expand business.   Thank you for your contribution and I hope the incentives are fun and attractive.</p>
