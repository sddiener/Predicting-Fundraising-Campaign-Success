<p>Bravado Gaming is more than just an e-sports team or organization. Bravado Gaming falls under the Bravado Universe. This brand has a clear call to action for gamers and enthusiasts all around the world and that is the zero-to-hero story that we try portray in every sense of the phrase. We’re more than just a team, but a way of life. A story that evolves from an e-sports organization to produce and create powerful individuals on their way to the successes of life. This is the Bravado way.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545914646/kjonrvjudx5mifbtuosc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The zero-to-hero story that we’d been working on during the course of 2017, was <a href=""http://bravadogaming.com/news-article/announcing-project-destiny/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Project Destiny</a>. Project Destiny would see a team (our CS:GO division) of 6 South African individuals embark on a journey to tell a story to the world by relocating to the United States of America to compete on one of the highest professional e-sports levels in the world.</p>
</div><div>In February 2018, the dream became a reality and our boys set off for Phoenix, Arizona of which they would live and play in a variety of e-sports qualifiers and leagues from the house. One of the main reasons and security was the invite from ESEA to compete in a season within the Main Division. Now we know that the Main Division isn’t the greatest of them all (being the 3rd best division at the time, and now the 4th) but we knew we’d have to work our way up the ladder while simultaneously competing in a variety of other qualifiers for events and leagues. The staff, management and players of Bravado Gaming were ready to take on a challenge that very few would sacrifice in order to turn a dream into a reality.</div><div> </div><div>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>FEBRUARY - MARCH 2018</h3>
<p>To cut the long story short, the Bravado CS:GO squad moved to Phoenix, Arizona and started competing in the ESEA Main Division while playing a variety of other qualifiers. Eventually, the team went on to win the ESEA Main Division which saw a promotion for the squad into the ESEA MDL League. We found lots of success within ESEA, but nothing yet in the form of other qualifiers and leagues... at least not yet. We knew that our presence in the region was in the early stages of reaching our goal, but this was a start, which would hopefully see fruition come in the form of success.</p>
</div><div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>APRIL 2018</h3>
</div>
<p>As time went by, our players slowly but surely proved their worth and potential of which then, all players were invited to play in the FaceIt Pro League while the team slowly but surely started being recognized by a variety of e-sports athletes, personalities and <a href=""https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2018/05/11/not-just-a-game-south-african-esports-team-relocates-to-phoenix-for-competition/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">media.</a> One of our highlights here is when we qualified for the ESL Belo Horizonte Closed Qualifier after beating (at the time) the worlds #15 – <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/matches/2322052/bravado-vs-renegades-esl-one-belo-horizonte-north-america-closed-qualifier"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Team Renegades</a>.</p>
<p>During this time we were also just a top 150 team in the world. You can read about the success of our Belo Horizonte progress on HLTV <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/events/3671/esl-one-belo-horizonte-north-america-closed-qualifier"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>JUNE - JULY 2018</h3>
<p>During this period, the squad went on to come out victorious in the <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/news/24389/bravado-win-esea-mdl-season-28-north-america-over-vision"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ESEA MDL</a> (Mountain Dew League), being one of the only few teams (never-mind being a team outside of the USA) winning back-to-back ESEA Seasons. By this time, the players and team were being recognized even more, making a variety of closed qualifiers and being invited to a couple at the same time. Things really started looking up from every perspective at this point in time.</p>
<p>Within the month of July, the squad had headed back to South Africa for a short player break before heading back to the United States of America to continue competing in the Mountain Dew League. The reason for competing in the MDL again was due to the fact that the previous season was not a promotional one. If it was, the team would be returning back to the USA to compete in the <a href=""https://pro.eslgaming.com/csgo/proleague/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ESL Pro League</a> – the highest possible league in the ESL/ESEA series you can achieve, boasting only the best of the best teams in the world.</p>
<p>While the team headed back to South Africa, our manager and coach, Tiaan T.C Coertzen stayed behind as we initiated a move from Phoenix, Arizona to Austin, Texas. At the time, making this move was a tough one as we were in some financial trouble, and because of this reason we exceeded our budgets and made use of our personal finances in order to make the move a reality. Some may ask why we made the move and I can tell you that there was a variety of reasons (some of which I cannot mention) but all-in-all, we thought the move to Texas would be a much better hub to compete from, as we all know, Texas is booming with investment and opportunity in the e-sports scene.</p>

</div>
<h3>AUGUST - SEPTEMBER 2018</h3>
<p>Our player break was cut short when we received an invite to the Chicago Intel Extreme Masters <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/events/3974/iem-chicago-2018-north-america-closed-qualifier"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Closed Qualifier</a> (this is very rare in our situation at the time) and we had no choice in a matter of 2 days to book flights (of which were super expensive and once again, put us into financial troubles for the quarter) to get the guys back to the USA to compete in the event. And off the team went to one of their first major invited closed qualifiers... So much had happened during these months and things were getting stronger and better as we gained more and more popularity, making more and more friends and being recognized and given respect to after making a variety of Closed Qualifiers.</p>
<p>More importantly, the teams that we had beaten in these open and closed qualifiers were some of the highest rated in the region, for example: beating teams such as E-UNITED, Renegades, Dignitas, Mythic and various other teams in a variety of these qualifiers. By now, the respect for what we set out to achieve started booming with popularity, especially the support coming from back home!</p>
<p>Every time, we made a closed qualifier, we were just so short of making it to the offline finals, but we kept our heads up, persevered and pushed harder than ever. We knew we couldn’t give up now, regardless of our financial situation or our status in the USA. We couldn’t disappoint.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE PRESENT</h3>
<p>We continued playing the next MDL League but unfortunately we were knocked out in the playoffs, however, this doesn’t mean that we couldn’t re-enter next season (January 2019) but it just meant that we had to try and win it again to make our way into the ESL Pro League. We also acknowledged that if we were to place in the top 2 of the playoffs, we wouldn’t be able to attend the South Africa WESG (China) qualifiers, as we would be at the MDL LAN during the same dates as the finals.</p>
<p>In the months of November and December, we experienced something and felt something of which the world woke up to. Things happened so fast, to the extent that we just couldn’t keep up with what was going on. The team went on to take part in the prestigious Dreamhack Winter 2018 North American qualifiers, besting their teams in their way and making it to yet, another, <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/news/25652/dreamhack-invitational-mumbai-details-revealed-with-35000-prize-pool"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">closed qualifier</a>. However, things this time were different as we saw a Bravado unleash and explode after months and months of preparation, perseverance and improvement.</p>
<p>The team qualified for the <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/news/25210/bravado-qualify-for-dreamhack-open-winter-over-intz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dreamhack Winter 2018</a> Closed Qualifier and saw 1 spot being given to the victor after an intense run in the open qualifiers. BOOM, finally, we made it past the closed qualifier besting Pro League Teams (and some of the best teams in the world) such as <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/matches/2328465/luminosity-vs-bravado-dreamhack-open-winter-2018-north-america-closed-qualifier"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Luminosity</a>, <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/matches/2328504/rogue-vs-bravado-dreamhack-open-winter-2018-north-america-closed-qualifier"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rogue</a> and <a href=""http://INTZ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">INTZ</a> to finally (AND FINALLY) find a spot at an offline event. We were going to Dreamhack Winter 2018 and the world was astonished at our achievement of making such a prestigious event. The support and perseverance finally paid off, but we weren’t satisfied just yet. While you're at it, read some of the interviews and stories HLTV conducted on us <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/news/25494/project-destiny-bravados-search-for-real-counter-strike"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/news/25531/sonic-we-put-the-name-of-south-african-cs-on-the-map"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Right after the our qualification into the Dreamhack Winter 2018 main event in Sweden, the boys first came back to South Africa (we had flights booked for them to come back during this time) – simultaneously the WESG South African qualifiers were taking place (stage 1) at this time.</p>
<p>The team went on to play the first stage of the WESG qualifiers, making it into the second stage later on in December and while we were obtaining our VISA’s, things just fell perfectly into place where we could attend Dreamhack Winter 2018 and return to South Africa to complete the WESG qualifiers of which we worked our way into the semi-finals in phase 1. The team took off for Sweden a few days earlier prior to the competition, to make sure that they adjust to jet-lag, the environment and most importantly to boot-camp in Jonkoping. Again, this was an additional and personal expense to get the guys to get as much preparation before entering the Arena at this prestigious event.</p>
<p>Finally the day came and the guys wouldn’t know what to expect as they were placed in the group of death alongside some very, very strong names. The competition began, the amount of negative comments from both professionals and trolls of how we would be dominated started. We didn’t care and knew that we were there to do the very best that we could, but most importantly to add value to the story we’ve been trying to build for so long. We went into the group stage with nothing to lose, but what I can tell you is that we entered with confidence and hunger to prove the negatives, wrong.</p>
<p>As I write this, I notice my body fills up with goosebumps as every part of every game had a story within itself.  The Bravado Gaming CS:GO squad went on to top their group at the prestigious event by beating the likes of <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/matches/2329475/optic-vs-bravado-dreamhack-open-winter-2018"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Optic Gaming</a> and then <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/matches/2329479/bravado-vs-g2-dreamhack-open-winter-2018"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">G2 Esports</a> – names, players and organizations who live within the millions of followers, within the best teams in the world – but we were there to show that the giants could be taken down. What a moment for e-sports. What a moment for Bravado Gaming. What a moment for the story to be told. Read more about this <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/news/25507/heroic-and-bravado-top-groups-at-dreamhack-through-to-semi-finals"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>After besting Optic Gaming and G2 Esports and topping our group we progressed to the semi-finals of the event, up against the home team of <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/matches/2329484/bravado-vs-x6tence-galaxy-dreamhack-open-winter-2018"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">X6tence</a>. Although our support was limited in the crowd, fans were cheering us on, online, in the chats, on websites, through media, messages and posts and we knew  that this was do-or-die time. If there was ever a time to make a point, it was now. Bravado went on to beat the home squad and earning ourselves in the GRAND FINALS of the Dreamhack Winter 2018 event, going up against the strong ENCE. Read more about this victory <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/news/25652/dreamhack-invitational-mumbai-details-revealed-with-35000-prize-pool"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Although we didn’t manage to best ENCE, falling to them in the Grand Finals and placing 2nd at the main event, we knew that this was a start to something massive. We knew that this would open eyes and turn heads to the point where a certain belief from the powers of above would recognize the potential and of course, the story. We ended up 2nd at Dreamhack Winter 2018 – an event that no-one would have expected us to do well in – never mind actually making it to the event.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YY15NdcFAvM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>After the completion of Dreamhack, the team returned back to South Africa to complete the 2nd stage of the WESG finals of which the victor would gain entrance into the main event in 2019 of which was taking place in China with a massive and staggering prize pool. The team went on to win the qualifier, securing their spot after an intense few days of rest, just returning back from Sweden but it doesn’t stop there... While the team was in-flight back to South Africa to play the final stage of the WESG qualifiers, we received an e-mail from Dreamhack India, personally inviting the squad to play at their main event invitational and without any doubt, we’re in no position right now to deny such massive invites. We accepted. Read more about this here.</p>
<p>Dreamhack Winter, Dreamhack India, WESG – it all got so overwhelming (but that good type of overwhelming)– all this craziness in matter of weeks didn’t end there. Immediately after the team won the WESG qualifiers in South Africa, off they went back to their house in Austin, Texas on Monday the  10th of December. Why? Because they had qualified for the ESL Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) Katowice Minor Closed Qualifiers. They had to play the day after they arrived in the USA, completely jet-lagged once again and suffering with flu from all the change of weather. The team got their days rest and got ready to urgently compete in the closed qualifier they made previously. This was so important because how it works is that if they qualified for the Minor in Poland (Katowice) then they would stand a chance to compete for the Major and let me tell you this: This will be the biggest Major (according to various sources) for CS:GO to date.</p>
<p>Tired with flu and jet-lagged the team played their first match-up on December the 12th and unfortunately losing their first match-up, dropping down into the losers bracket. We can’t imagine that this would be easy based on the circumstances we went through in the past couple of weeks. They got up, they fought hard and the boys pushed through the loser bracket beating <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/matches/2329572/bravado-vs-luminosity-americas-minor-north-america-closed-qualifier-iem-katowice-2019"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Luminosity</a> (once again, with a much stronger line-up), <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/matches/2329576/singularity-vs-bravado-americas-minor-north-america-closed-qualifier-iem-katowice-2019"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Singularity</a> and finally <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/matches/2329578/bravado-vs-test-takers-americas-minor-north-america-closed-qualifier-iem-katowice-2019"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Test Takers</a> to secure themselves a spot at the ESL Intel Extreme Masters Minor Main Event to take place in early January 2019 in Katowice, Poland.

<p>Coming back to the Dreamhack India story: Again, to cut the long story short, the team made way to Mumbai, India where they competed in the Dreamhack India 2018 Invitational securing 1st spot, winning the tournament and making waves throughout a region we've never competed in. You can read more about our success at Dreamhack India by heading over to HLTV.ORG <a href=""https://www.hltv.org/events/4135/americas-minor-north-america-closed-qualifier-iem-katowice-2019"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>In a matter of weeks we came 2nd at Dreamhack Winter Sweden, won the South African WESG Qualifiers for China, won the Dreamhack India Invitational and made it into the IEM Katowice Minor. Finally, we started seeing some light and our new and old fans started to cheer for the success of the team, making hype through micro and mass media. Telling that story that we started. Throughout the months we’ve achieved a-lot, through the highs and the low’s and through times of tears and times of happiness, but what matters is this: The future is bright and this team of individuals have proven and more importantly, worked SO HARD to show what you can create from nothing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545914587/a9b3k0wndkbxzqup44iv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>PROJECT DESTINY MAY COME TO AN END</h3>
<p>Throughout our highs and lows and our recent achievements, we've been working so hard (behind closed doors) the entire year to ensure that the success of the team goes unnoticed to potential corporates, investors and brands. During this time we've been in chats and negotiations with multiple companies (endemic and non-endemic) in order to secure additional funding to ensure that there is no risk of ending this story anytime soon as having to pay for Travel, Rent, Utilities, Allowances, Food, Vehicle, VISA's (and more) has been super costly.</p>
<p>In addition, we've been working on acquiring O1/P1 Sporting VISA's for the players, however, we haven't been able to achieve this goal (as we cannot establish a sponsorship in the USA) which gives threat to our players each and every-time they enter the USA.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545914503/rulnltlx3cduntfseenh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As an organization, we've entered into much debt, pushing hard and strong day-by-day, month-by-month to make sure that we can keep our dream alive of becoming one of the best e-sports call-to-actions the world has seen.</p>
<p>Sacrifices have been made by Bravado Gaming as well as the players and directors of the organization, and due to the lack of additional funding and increased debt to support the players in the USA (which also affects the acquiring of P1/O1 VISA's) we've had no choice but to make the call and bring the Bravado Gaming CS:GO squad back to South Africa at the end of January 2019 after the Katowice Minor.</p>
<p>During now and then we will keep pushing as hard as we can to ensure that somehow, someway, we may find more finance which will keep this dream alive, allowing the zero-to-hero story continue and keep inspiring gamers throughout the world.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP</h3>
<p>By surviving another quarter (February, March &amp; April) this gives us an additional 3 months to try and conclude any future and potential partnerships that will allow us to continue competing on the International map in the United States of America. </p>
<p>Because of this reason we've had no choice but to ask for your help in allowing us the opportunity to try and survive in the upcoming quarter and hence we've created a fund-raising campaign to seek any potential help that may exist out there, one way or another.</p>
<p>We've included the costs of keeping our team in the USA for an additional 3 months below, for your information. This doesn't include any content/production costs, general operational costs, VISA costs, additional house costs and a few other costs.</p>
<p>By allowing our team to stay another 3 months in the USA, this will allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue competing in qualifiers and events.</li>
<li>Gain practice for the upcoming qualified events such as the IEM Major (if we qualify at the Minor) &amp; the WESG.</li>
<li>Continue playing in the next season of the ESEA Mountain Dew League.</li>
<li>Allow us the opportunity to find additional funding from partners/sponsors in the duration of those 3 months.</li>
<li>Give us the opportunity to try and obtain our P1 Sporting VISA's.</li>
<li>Continue telling our story and struggle of trying to become one of the best teams in the world.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Bravado Gaming is more than just an e-sports team or organization. Bravado Gaming falls under the Bravado Universe. This brand has a clear call to action for gamers and enthusiasts all around the world and that is the zero-to-hero story that we try portray in every sense of the phrase. We’re more than just a team, but a way of life. A story that evolves from an e-sports organization to produce and create powerful individuals on their way to the successes of life. This is the Bravado way.

The zero-to-hero story that we’d been working on during the course of 2017, was Project Destiny. Project Destiny would see a team (our CS:GO division) of 6 South African individuals embark on a journey to tell a story to the world by relocating to the United States of America to compete on one of the highest professional e-sports levels in the world.
In February 2018, the dream became a reality and our boys set off for Phoenix, Arizona of which they would live and play in a variety of e-sports qualifiers and leagues from the house. One of the main reasons and security was the invite from ESEA to compete in a season within the Main Division. Now we know that the Main Division isn’t the greatest of them all (being the 3rd best division at the time, and now the 4th) but we knew we’d have to work our way up the ladder while simultaneously competing in a variety of other qualifiers for events and leagues. The staff, management and players of Bravado Gaming were ready to take on a challenge that very few would sacrifice in order to turn a dream into a reality. 

 

FEBRUARY - MARCH 2018
To cut the long story short, the Bravado CS:GO squad moved to Phoenix, Arizona and started competing in the ESEA Main Division while playing a variety of other qualifiers. Eventually, the team went on to win the ESEA Main Division which saw a promotion for the squad into the ESEA MDL League. We found lots of success within ESEA, but nothing yet in the form of other qualifiers and leagues... at least not yet. We knew that our presence in the region was in the early stages of reaching our goal, but this was a start, which would hopefully see fruition come in the form of success.


 
APRIL 2018

As time went by, our players slowly but surely proved their worth and potential of which then, all players were invited to play in the FaceIt Pro League while the team slowly but surely started being recognized by a variety of e-sports athletes, personalities and media. One of our highlights here is when we qualified for the ESL Belo Horizonte Closed Qualifier after beating (at the time) the worlds #15 – Team Renegades.
During this time we were also just a top 150 team in the world. You can read about the success of our Belo Horizonte progress on HLTV here.

 
JUNE - JULY 2018
During this period, the squad went on to come out victorious in the ESEA MDL (Mountain Dew League), being one of the only few teams (never-mind being a team outside of the USA) winning back-to-back ESEA Seasons. By this time, the players and team were being recognized even more, making a variety of closed qualifiers and being invited to a couple at the same time. Things really started looking up from every perspective at this point in time.
Within the month of July, the squad had headed back to South Africa for a short player break before heading back to the United States of America to continue competing in the Mountain Dew League. The reason for competing in the MDL again was due to the fact that the previous season was not a promotional one. If it was, the team would be returning back to the USA to compete in the ESL Pro League – the highest possible league in the ESL/ESEA series you can achieve, boasting only the best of the best teams in the world.
While the team headed back to South Africa, our manager and coach, Tiaan T.C Coertzen stayed behind as we initiated a move from Phoenix, Arizona to Austin, Texas. At the time, making this move was a tough one as we were in some financial trouble, and because of this reason we exceeded our budgets and made use of our personal finances in order to make the move a reality. Some may ask why we made the move and I can tell you that there was a variety of reasons (some of which I cannot mention) but all-in-all, we thought the move to Texas would be a much better hub to compete from, as we all know, Texas is booming with investment and opportunity in the e-sports scene.


 

AUGUST - SEPTEMBER 2018
Our player break was cut short when we received an invite to the Chicago Intel Extreme Masters Closed Qualifier (this is very rare in our situation at the time) and we had no choice in a matter of 2 days to book flights (of which were super expensive and once again, put us into financial troubles for the quarter) to get the guys back to the USA to compete in the event. And off the team went to one of their first major invited closed qualifiers... So much had happened during these months and things were getting stronger and better as we gained more and more popularity, making more and more friends and being recognized and given respect to after making a variety of Closed Qualifiers.
More importantly, the teams that we had beaten in these open and closed qualifiers were some of the highest rated in the region, for example: beating teams such as E-UNITED, Renegades, Dignitas, Mythic and various other teams in a variety of these qualifiers. By now, the respect for what we set out to achieve started booming with popularity, especially the support coming from back home!
Every time, we made a closed qualifier, we were just so short of making it to the offline finals, but we kept our heads up, persevered and pushed harder than ever. We knew we couldn’t give up now, regardless of our financial situation or our status in the USA. We couldn’t disappoint.
 
THE PRESENT
We continued playing the next MDL League but unfortunately we were knocked out in the playoffs, however, this doesn’t mean that we couldn’t re-enter next season (January 2019) but it just meant that we had to try and win it again to make our way into the ESL Pro League. We also acknowledged that if we were to place in the top 2 of the playoffs, we wouldn’t be able to attend the South Africa WESG (China) qualifiers, as we would be at the MDL LAN during the same dates as the finals.
In the months of November and December, we experienced something and felt something of which the world woke up to. Things happened so fast, to the extent that we just couldn’t keep up with what was going on. The team went on to take part in the prestigious Dreamhack Winter 2018 North American qualifiers, besting their teams in their way and making it to yet, another, closed qualifier. However, things this time were different as we saw a Bravado unleash and explode after months and months of preparation, perseverance and improvement.
The team qualified for the Dreamhack Winter 2018 Closed Qualifier and saw 1 spot being given to the victor after an intense run in the open qualifiers. BOOM, finally, we made it past the closed qualifier besting Pro League Teams (and some of the best teams in the world) such as Luminosity, Rogue and INTZ to finally (AND FINALLY) find a spot at an offline event. We were going to Dreamhack Winter 2018 and the world was astonished at our achievement of making such a prestigious event. The support and perseverance finally paid off, but we weren’t satisfied just yet. While you're at it, read some of the interviews and stories HLTV conducted on us here and here.
Right after the our qualification into the Dreamhack Winter 2018 main event in Sweden, the boys first came back to South Africa (we had flights booked for them to come back during this time) – simultaneously the WESG South African qualifiers were taking place (stage 1) at this time.
The team went on to play the first stage of the WESG qualifiers, making it into the second stage later on in December and while we were obtaining our VISA’s, things just fell perfectly into place where we could attend Dreamhack Winter 2018 and return to South Africa to complete the WESG qualifiers of which we worked our way into the semi-finals in phase 1. The team took off for Sweden a few days earlier prior to the competition, to make sure that they adjust to jet-lag, the environment and most importantly to boot-camp in Jonkoping. Again, this was an additional and personal expense to get the guys to get as much preparation before entering the Arena at this prestigious event.
Finally the day came and the guys wouldn’t know what to expect as they were placed in the group of death alongside some very, very strong names. The competition began, the amount of negative comments from both professionals and trolls of how we would be dominated started. We didn’t care and knew that we were there to do the very best that we could, but most importantly to add value to the story we’ve been trying to build for so long. We went into the group stage with nothing to lose, but what I can tell you is that we entered with confidence and hunger to prove the negatives, wrong.
As I write this, I notice my body fills up with goosebumps as every part of every game had a story within itself.  The Bravado Gaming CS:GO squad went on to top their group at the prestigious event by beating the likes of Optic Gaming and then G2 Esports – names, players and organizations who live within the millions of followers, within the best teams in the world – but we were there to show that the giants could be taken down. What a moment for e-sports. What a moment for Bravado Gaming. What a moment for the story to be told. Read more about this here.
After besting Optic Gaming and G2 Esports and topping our group we progressed to the semi-finals of the event, up against the home team of X6tence. Although our support was limited in the crowd, fans were cheering us on, online, in the chats, on websites, through media, messages and posts and we knew  that this was do-or-die time. If there was ever a time to make a point, it was now. Bravado went on to beat the home squad and earning ourselves in the GRAND FINALS of the Dreamhack Winter 2018 event, going up against the strong ENCE. Read more about this victory here.
Although we didn’t manage to best ENCE, falling to them in the Grand Finals and placing 2nd at the main event, we knew that this was a start to something massive. We knew that this would open eyes and turn heads to the point where a certain belief from the powers of above would recognize the potential and of course, the story. We ended up 2nd at Dreamhack Winter 2018 – an event that no-one would have expected us to do well in – never mind actually making it to the event.

 
After the completion of Dreamhack, the team returned back to South Africa to complete the 2nd stage of the WESG finals of which the victor would gain entrance into the main event in 2019 of which was taking place in China with a massive and staggering prize pool. The team went on to win the qualifier, securing their spot after an intense few days of rest, just returning back from Sweden but it doesn’t stop there... While the team was in-flight back to South Africa to play the final stage of the WESG qualifiers, we received an e-mail from Dreamhack India, personally inviting the squad to play at their main event invitational and without any doubt, we’re in no position right now to deny such massive invites. We accepted. Read more about this here.
Dreamhack Winter, Dreamhack India, WESG – it all got so overwhelming (but that good type of overwhelming)– all this craziness in matter of weeks didn’t end there. Immediately after the team won the WESG qualifiers in South Africa, off they went back to their house in Austin, Texas on Monday the  10th of December. Why? Because they had qualified for the ESL Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) Katowice Minor Closed Qualifiers. They had to play the day after they arrived in the USA, completely jet-lagged once again and suffering with flu from all the change of weather. The team got their days rest and got ready to urgently compete in the closed qualifier they made previously. This was so important because how it works is that if they qualified for the Minor in Poland (Katowice) then they would stand a chance to compete for the Major and let me tell you this: This will be the biggest Major (according to various sources) for CS:GO to date.
Tired with flu and jet-lagged the team played their first match-up on December the 12th and unfortunately losing their first match-up, dropping down into the losers bracket. We can’t imagine that this would be easy based on the circumstances we went through in the past couple of weeks. They got up, they fought hard and the boys pushed through the loser bracket beating Luminosity (once again, with a much stronger line-up), Singularity and finally Test Takers to secure themselves a spot at the ESL Intel Extreme Masters Minor Main Event to take place in early January 2019 in Katowice, Poland. Read more about this here.

Coming back to the Dreamhack India story: Again, to cut the long story short, the team made way to Mumbai, India where they competed in the Dreamhack India 2018 Invitational securing 1st spot, winning the tournament and making waves throughout a region we've never competed in. You can read more about our success at Dreamhack India by heading over to HLTV.ORG here.
In a matter of weeks we came 2nd at Dreamhack Winter Sweden, won the South African WESG Qualifiers for China, won the Dreamhack India Invitational and made it into the IEM Katowice Minor. Finally, we started seeing some light and our new and old fans started to cheer for the success of the team, making hype through micro and mass media. Telling that story that we started. Throughout the months we’ve achieved a-lot, through the highs and the low’s and through times of tears and times of happiness, but what matters is this: The future is bright and this team of individuals have proven and more importantly, worked SO HARD to show what you can create from nothing.

 
PROJECT DESTINY MAY COME TO AN END
Throughout our highs and lows and our recent achievements, we've been working so hard (behind closed doors) the entire year to ensure that the success of the team goes unnoticed to potential corporates, investors and brands. During this time we've been in chats and negotiations with multiple companies (endemic and non-endemic) in order to secure additional funding to ensure that there is no risk of ending this story anytime soon as having to pay for Travel, Rent, Utilities, Allowances, Food, Vehicle, VISA's (and more) has been super costly.
In addition, we've been working on acquiring O1/P1 Sporting VISA's for the players, however, we haven't been able to achieve this goal (as we cannot establish a sponsorship in the USA) which gives threat to our players each and every-time they enter the USA.

As an organization, we've entered into much debt, pushing hard and strong day-by-day, month-by-month to make sure that we can keep our dream alive of becoming one of the best e-sports call-to-actions the world has seen.
Sacrifices have been made by Bravado Gaming as well as the players and directors of the organization, and due to the lack of additional funding and increased debt to support the players in the USA (which also affects the acquiring of P1/O1 VISA's) we've had no choice but to make the call and bring the Bravado Gaming CS:GO squad back to South Africa at the end of January 2019 after the Katowice Minor.
During now and then we will keep pushing as hard as we can to ensure that somehow, someway, we may find more finance which will keep this dream alive, allowing the zero-to-hero story continue and keep inspiring gamers throughout the world.
 
WE NEED YOUR HELP
By surviving another quarter (February, March & April) this gives us an additional 3 months to try and conclude any future and potential partnerships that will allow us to continue competing on the International map in the United States of America. 
Because of this reason we've had no choice but to ask for your help in allowing us the opportunity to try and survive in the upcoming quarter and hence we've created a fund-raising campaign to seek any potential help that may exist out there, one way or another.
We've included the costs of keeping our team in the USA for an additional 3 months below, for your information. This doesn't include any content/production costs, general operational costs, VISA costs, additional house costs and a few other costs.
By allowing our team to stay another 3 months in the USA, this will allow us to:

Continue competing in qualifiers and events.
Gain practice for the upcoming qualified events such as the IEM Major (if we qualify at the Minor) & the WESG.
Continue playing in the next season of the ESEA Mountain Dew League.
Allow us the opportunity to find additional funding from partners/sponsors in the duration of those 3 months.
Give us the opportunity to try and obtain our P1 Sporting VISA's.
Continue telling our story and struggle of trying to become one of the best teams in the world.

<div>Yes, almost your microcontroller can powered directly from a 3.7V LiPo. But not for other devices, like servo, or maybe you want to charge your LiPo using 5V LiPo charger from unstable solar cell.  <p></p>
<p>note : don't used this booster from an unprotected LiPo battery, now days most LiPo batteries has built-in low voltage protection.Use only a single cell LiPo battery to this booster, or other power that below 5.3V.  That's why we put enable-pad so that you can decide when to activate the booster. </p>
<p>The booster is based on the popular MCP1640. This booster convert 0.7V to 5.3V-5.4V, but we recommended to drain at least from 0.9V (3.3V is highly recommended).  We choose 5.3V-5.4V for many considerations. First, it's still save for most of your 5-volt electronic devices.<br/></p>
<p>Second, you can swap your low power source to USB to this booster, because USB port usually use 5V-5.2V and this booster can only handle input voltage lower than the output voltage (5.3V-5.4V).  </p>
<p>Third, the voltage may drop when you put the diode for your protection circuit or long cable from your source.  This booster doesn't magically squeezing your power supply, so keep in mind to calculate your amperage source to your demand.<br/><br/>After all, you can change the resistor to get your voltage demands, as long the input voltage is lower than the output voltage.</p>

</div></div>","What is ZµC Proto Board? ZµC Proto Board is a perfboard/protoboard that combined through-hole and SMD pads, so you can freely put through-hole and/or SMD components on this board. ZµC Proto Board also has micro USB and Male USB type-A populated, that will make powering prototype easier. 
2 in 1 - Fit almost SMD and through hole componentsSo from now on you can forget about buying SOIC breakout boards, because you can put almost any SOIC components and also most SMD components on this board.


Ultra low cost prototypingWith this protoboard you can also reduce your electronic waste by reusing the components for your prototype or project.


Non-through hole This board utilizes non-plated through hole pads. This mean pad on different layer is independent, so you can do double-side wiring, enabling you to build more complex circuits with the smallest dimension you can get.
Powering prototype never been easier than this

        
Now days micro-USB can be found on almost any smartphone, so you can easily power up your project with your phone charger.


With micro USB : just plug your phone charger to your prototype.
With A Male type USB : cut and plug directly to your USB port.*


* with a little hack/modification.

Double ISP port for your microcontrollerBecause it's somewhat pain to trace the ISP pin to your project, This board is equipped with two ISP ports to easily program your microcontroller project.  With two ISP port you can split up the board to your demands size.

Two variant of thicknessThis proto board comes with two variant, the thin one (0.8mm) and the thick one (ordinary PCB size).
The thin one is easily cut, designedfor small project and lightweight projects/prototypes.
The thick one is more robust and more rigid, designed for heavy task involving hard friction and collision potential.
Booster version This booster convert  from 0.7V to 5.3V-5.4V but we recommended to drain at least from 0.9V (3.3V is highly recommended). Because some devices need 5V to operate, such as micro or standard servo, or charge your single LiPo battery. For double layer version you also get SMD LED Tester, but for the single layer you have to stack the board to get a working booster.*

* we'll show how to stack the single layer booster version * SMD LED tester doesn't include resistor, you have to manually add the resistor to make it works.
Arduino shield versionAs we know Arduino headers use non-standard pin spacing. Learn to deal with it, as there’s too many Arduino shields in production to have any hope for a change in the future. This protoboard should make it a lot of easier to design your own boards.

So don't waste your Arduino shield to be used in your prototype, or even more, you can make your own Arduino board !!  
What is in ZµC Proto Board?



All variant of ZµC Proto Board has at least micro USB, schottky diode and capacitor distributed.


For booster version has DC booster populated.


For Arduino version has reset button populated.



What the difference with another proto board?



No more sawing with thin version





How many type ZµC Proto Board has?

The variant of ZµC Proto Board are combination of single or two layers, non-booster or booster version, and basic or Arduino version :


Single layer basic

Single layer with booster

Single layer Arduino version

Single layer Arduino version with booster



Double layer basic (thick and thin version)

Double layer with booster (thick and thin version)

Double layer Arduino version (thick and thin version)

Double layer Arduino version with booster (thick and thin version)


* Single layer has no masking, material is FR2* Double layer is non-through hole, with masking, material is FR4 * Double layer has two different thicknesses

Operates and consumes only 19 μA while operating at no load, and provides a true disconnect from input to output while shut down (EN = GND).

A “true” load disconnect mode provides input to output isolation while disabled by removing the normal boost regulator diode path from input to output. A Bypass mode option connects the input to the output using the integrated low resistance P-Channel MOSFET, which provides a low bias keep-alive voltage for circuits operating in Deep Sleep mode. Both options consumeless than 1 μA of input current.

You’ll also meet the other girls for the first time there!""One Last Crane"" is a visual novel centered on Yuuki Murakami, a boy who has a brain tumor. After a long year of treatment without any positive results, Yuuki asks for his final wish: to return to his hometown and fulfill his promise to meet again with his childhood friend, Saki Nishimura. However, as always, things are hard for him.  Saki no longer lives where she used to, and no one knows her whereabouts. The last hint Yuuki got was from the high school Saki had said she wanted to attend—Shimizu High School. Together with his adopted little sister, Mary, and his new tomboyish neighbor, Chihiro, Yuuki keeps searching for the girl, only to meet Asuka Fujimoto, the most popular girl at school, who happens to look like Saki.  Not once has Yuuki doubted that Asuka really is Saki, but Asuka gives him the cold shoulder without admitting that she’s Saki. Could she really be a different person? Faced with the prospect that his life could end soon, Yuuki is determined to find Saki, even within another person.Shiro Takahashi from Ayato Sound Create is an experienced Japanese composer who has worked for years in the visual novel industry.

<p class=""defaultstyle"">No, and that's why it can be cheap! It does not run games by itself, your computer does that. What it does is bridge your computer to your television, giving you an experience similar to a big budget console at very little cost.</p>

<p class=""defaultstyle"">Here they come: Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft are all launching their new consoles: the Xbox One, the Playstation 4 and the Wii-U. It's great for gaming competition. Or is it? We spent so much on our current consoles and library of games, we don't really want to buy a new set of consoles; and none of those are retro-compatible with our current games!</p>
<p class=""defaultstyle"">It's obvious their first goal is to put their hands in our pockets. We don't really mind paying for gaming, but are we getting the most for our money? They are designing a new set of consoles because they want us to buy them, not because they can't do better or offer me more!</p>
<p class=""defaultstyle"">Some say consoles are better for gaming while others swear by the PC. Why such a separation? We truly believe this is not the best we can do. We think it is time to end the differences between PC and console gaming.</p>
<p class=""defaultstyle"">So here's what we want;</p>
<ul>
<li>Play on our television, in our living room or anywhere else.</li>
<li>Play with a controller, or the input of our choice!</li>
<li>Have great visual quality.</li>
<li>Cheap!</li>
</ul><p class=""defaultstyle"">The solution is simple; bridge your computer to your living room!</p>

<p>Developing new hardware is not cheap; the electronic, the code, the design and the plastic molding are only part of the cost. The FCC Certification alone is very expensive.</p>
<p>We don't want to create a one-shot product that people would never hear about it again. We want to make a quality product that will change our perception of computers and displays.</p>
<p>But when compared to the price of game consoles, media centers or digital recorders which are designed for a specific and sometimes unique purpose, Bridge appear to be quite cheap.</p>
<p>We are using the expertise gained in the manufacturing of micro-computer such as the Beagle Bone or the Raspberry Pi. Without them, there would be no way to bring the processing power needed in such a small package at a reasonable price.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>If you know our friend Doug and you miss him, you should put some money towards this.  If we meet our funding goal, the money will go to cover Doug's hotel bill along with food and anything else he needs while he is up here.</p>
<p>This is a serious effort, Lisa and I have found a good, cheap hotel and the 500 dollar minimum should cover all costs.</p>
<p>It's up to you all, the legions of Doug Fans (TM) to make it happen.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need money, you need Doug.</p>
<p>You pay money, you get Doug.</p>
<p>If we get to 500 dollars, then the money will cover Doug's hotel bill and food.  Any additional funds (after Indiegogo gets its cut) will go directly to Doug.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Doug gets to come back to New Hampshire and we get to hang out with him after OGC. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For those who can't afford to give money, if the project is funded, you can take Doug out for dinner, run a game for him, or even bake him a cake.  I'm sure his birthday was sometime last year and you probably didn't buy him a cake.  So take this opportunity to fix that.</p>

<p>Peri-Sight is a patented electronic sighting system that attaches to the barrel of paintball markers and most airsoft guns that actually allows you to look around corners. Peri-Sight is a two-part system: a high definition (HD) camera that is mounted directly below the barrel and an LCD display that is mounted off center. The LCD display quickly rotates up to 180 degrees allowing the player and the display to remain hidden behind a bunker, only exposing the barrel and camera. It also quickly folds in when not in use. Not only can you use Peri-Sight from behind a bunker or obstacle to survey the field and look for your opponents, but you can actually mark them as you remain virtually invisible! This means you no longer need to expose yourself in order to eliminate your opponents. Think of how this will advance the action and the strategy of your game. It brings stealth to a whole new level!</p>

Peri-Sight is a patented electronic sighting system that attaches to the barrel of paintball markers and most airsoft guns that actually allows you to look around corners. Peri-Sight is a two-part system: a high definition (HD) camera that is mounted directly below the barrel and an LCD display that is mounted off center. The LCD display quickly rotates up to 180 degrees allowing the player and the display to remain hidden behind a bunker, only exposing the barrel and camera. It also quickly folds in when not in use. Not only can you use Peri-Sight from behind a bunker or obstacle to survey the field and look for your opponents, but you can actually mark them as you remain virtually invisible! This means you no longer need to expose yourself in order to eliminate your opponents. Think of how this will advance the action and the strategy of your game. It brings stealth to a whole new level!

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Midli: (/pronounced like the drink 'mead' + the name 'Lee':/) from the Old Norse word 'miðli' meaning in-between</i></p>
<p>At DinoByte Labs we’ve been gamers for over 20 years, and we love looking at how we can take the classic games we loved, and add a modern twist. Our favorite games today have depth and great stories, so when we started working on Midli we wanted to combine unique and dynamic mechanics, with captivating art and sound design, and a compelling choice driven narrative.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Heli's Concept Design</i></p>
<p>We were inspired by “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God”, a Korean TV drama written by Kim Eun-sook. It tells a series of short character based stories parallel to the main plot, each one only a few minutes long, yet they quickly get you caring for the characters and what they’re going through. This became the basis for how we designed our narrative, and how we present the characters Heli meets through the game.   </p>
<p>What you learn about those characters will change based on whether you collect their light or dark fragments. You can even influence the outcomes of their stories, as it will be up to you to determine their fates, either by ‘forgiving’ or ‘forgetting’ them. Ultimately this will even change how Heli's story ends.</p>

<p>You will get to know our cast of lost spirits through their own unique short stories spanning aesthetically and mechanically different worlds, each as diverse as the characters themselves.</p>

<li>Yuri Park, a youthful girl in her 20s, struggles with the uncertainty of her future </li>
<li>Erik Haraldsson, a husband and father, is unable to express his emotions and affection </li>
<li>Josephine Lewis, a family matriarch, regrets missing out on the life she dreamed of </li>

<p>A core part of our design for Midli was always centered around the mood and atmosphere. The story deals with some darker themes, and we wanted our art to reflect this. However, it was important to us that our game felt otherworldly and calm, not scary or creepy.  </p>
<p>Louise, our producer, has a lot of experience with anxiety and panic attacks, and one of the main things that help her feel at ease are soothing sounds, such as wind chimes, which coincidentally and appropriately have a lot of associations with spirits.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/714/083/e41f1c16115ca5e290f80ebb940ff392_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1501429227&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=497ada0227f9df6cb18748df10353103"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To create the mood we wanted for Midli, we added a lot more of these atmospheric sounds such as rain, whispers, bells and wind instruments. Coupled with our art style and ambient lighting, this really helped Midli have that otherworldly feeling we were going for.</p>
<p>We're also super excited to announce that we'll be working with award winning, and College Emmy-nominated composer Robert Mai to create a full original soundtrack for the game! Not only that, we're also offering a limited chance to get the full digital soundtrack for a discounted £5! You will need to get the OST perk separately from perks under £100. Have a listen to a preview:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEuN91TZziA"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>Our game will feature 8+ unique songs, all with variations to give a different feel to the various levels within each world. We can't wait to show you more soon!</p>
<p>Part of why we aspired to perfect this mood and aesthetic, is because we feel visual storytelling can be as important as the narrative itself, so our art and atmosphere is all formed with specific themes and symbolism in mind relating to the story of Midli and it’s cast.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506533167/sood4qpfs0o027qnqzrm.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>When we were designing our mechanics, we thought a lot about how we could translate parts of our atmosphere into gameplay. If it was raining, shouldn’t that affect how fast the Heli flies, and could we use light to guide or darkness to obscure? </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Forgotten Shadows Concept Sketches</i></p>
<p>Spirits are not meant to linger in Midli for too long, but during our world building, we liked the idea of having these dark creatures who were permanently stuck there.

<p>Risks and challenges:</p>
<p>Assuming we get funded, this game WILL get made, 100% certain, no matter what. Yes, we’re that confident in it. However, making games costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time.

</div></div>","Our funding goal has been hit on Kickstarter! We're overwhelmed by the amazing response from all of you! It really means a lot to us that so many of you have felt a connection to our game. We are now doing some extra crowdfunding to try to hit some of our stretch goals, so if you missed out on collecting our awesome Midli rewards, you can now get them here!


Midli is a laid-back Breakout inspired adventure, with a relaxing, yet dark atmosphere, where you collect the soul fragments of lingering spirits to uncover their stories and help them move on.  
Play as Heli, a mysterious girl who guides the fates of those stuck in Midli, as she discovers a story of her own.  

Midli: (/pronounced like the drink 'mead' + the name 'Lee':/) from the Old Norse word 'miðli' meaning in-between
At DinoByte Labs we’ve been gamers for over 20 years, and we love looking at how we can take the classic games we loved, and add a modern twist. Our favorite games today have depth and great stories, so when we started working on Midli we wanted to combine unique and dynamic mechanics, with captivating art and sound design, and a compelling choice driven narrative.
Midli is developed for initial release iOS and Android mobile devices, with the potential for a PC release if we hit our stretch goals.
Features:  

Enjoy a deeper mobile gaming experience
Change the story depending on how you play  
Discover multiple endings!
Get to know a diverse cast of characters, each with their own story
Explore a dark, yet relaxing atmosphere 
Experience the story of Midli through animated cutscenes
Encounter several unique and interesting enemies
Play with environmental obstacles like rain and darkness, time manipulation and much more!
45 levels, spanning 5 aesthetically and mechanically different worlds - with more worlds depending on stretch goal funding!


Pre-Alpha Gameplay

Remember, we have a £5 perk which gives you the Midli original soundtrack at a huge discount, but this is outside of all perks under £100!

Our physical rewards make a great gift, and you will receive them well in time for the holidays!

Midli follows the journey of Heli, a girl tasked with helping those who struggle to move on from her world.

Heli's Concept Design
We were inspired by “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God”, a Korean TV drama written by Kim Eun-sook. It tells a series of short character based stories parallel to the main plot, each one only a few minutes long, yet they quickly get you caring for the characters and what they’re going through. This became the basis for how we designed our narrative, and how we present the characters Heli meets through the game.   
What you learn about those characters will change based on whether you collect their light or dark fragments. You can even influence the outcomes of their stories, as it will be up to you to determine their fates, either by ‘forgiving’ or ‘forgetting’ them. Ultimately this will even change how Heli's story ends.

Pre-Alpha Footage
You will get to know our cast of lost spirits through their own unique short stories spanning aesthetically and mechanically different worlds, each as diverse as the characters themselves.

Yuri Park, a youthful girl in her 20s, struggles with the uncertainty of her future 
Erik Haraldsson, a husband and father, is unable to express his emotions and affection 
Josephine Lewis, a family matriarch, regrets missing out on the life she dreamed of 
Nicolas Santiago, a remorseful troublemaker, fears others see him as darkly as he sees himself 


Yuri Park, one of the spirits stuck in Midli

A core part of our design for Midli was always centered around the mood and atmosphere. The story deals with some darker themes, and we wanted our art to reflect this. However, it was important to us that our game felt otherworldly and calm, not scary or creepy.  
Louise, our producer, has a lot of experience with anxiety and panic attacks, and one of the main things that help her feel at ease are soothing sounds, such as wind chimes, which coincidentally and appropriately have a lot of associations with spirits.

To create the mood we wanted for Midli, we added a lot more of these atmospheric sounds such as rain, whispers, bells and wind instruments. Coupled with our art style and ambient lighting, this really helped Midli have that otherworldly feeling we were going for.
We're also super excited to announce that we'll be working with award winning, and College Emmy-nominated composer Robert Mai to create a full original soundtrack for the game! Not only that, we're also offering a limited chance to get the full digital soundtrack for a discounted £5! You will need to get the OST perk separately from perks under £100. Have a listen to a preview:

Our game will feature 8+ unique songs, all with variations to give a different feel to the various levels within each world. We can't wait to show you more soon!
Part of why we aspired to perfect this mood and aesthetic, is because we feel visual storytelling can be as important as the narrative itself, so our art and atmosphere is all formed with specific themes and symbolism in mind relating to the story of Midli and it’s cast.

Concept Storyboards for Heli's Story

When we were designing our mechanics, we thought a lot about how we could translate parts of our atmosphere into gameplay. If it was raining, shouldn’t that affect how fast the Heli flies, and could we use light to guide or darkness to obscure? 

Pre-Alpha: Rain and Darkness Levels
We used these elements to inspire our design, and we’ve worked really hard to make Midli interactive and dynamic, allowing you to play with time manipulation, spiderweb slingshots and much, much more!  

Forgotten Shadows Concept Sketches
Spirits are not meant to linger in Midli for too long, but during our world building, we liked the idea of having these dark creatures who were permanently stuck there. We designed the Forgotten Shadows based on this, ghostly beings who come in various shapes and sizes, each one adding something different to the gameplay.

Evolution of a Forgotten Shadow from concept to game (Not final art)
  




Shadow World (£4,500) GOAL REACHED! - An additional “secret” unlockable short world dedicated to the Forgotten Shadows and their story 

Additional Soundtrack and Art (£6,000) - Upgraded soundtrack with more original music and even more unique art throughout the game 

Heli’s Story (£8,000) - Additional levels, cutscenes and story focusing on Heli and her backstory

PC Version (£10,000) - A PC release of the game with widescreen cutscenes 


We are a pretty small team of 3 based in London. While we all have experience making games for others, Midli is really our first chance at creating and publishing something entirely on our own, based solely on our vision.
So far we have self-funded (yes, from our own pockets!), both the making of our prototype and our first demo, but we really need YOUR help in order to bring Midli to the players.

Making games cost a lot of money, so here is how we anticipate to divide our Kickstarter and Indie GoGo funds

Risks and challenges:
Assuming we get funded, this game WILL get made, 100% certain, no matter what. Yes, we’re that confident in it. However, making games costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time. We really want to release the full game in November, and we’ll be working hard to hit that deadline, but it may take shorter or longer than expected.
If we hit some of our stretch goals, this may mean additional development time is needed, but this should not go beyond the end of 2017.
Our rewards will also obviously be shipped as soon as we’re able, but if there ends up being a lot of you, this too might take a bit of time. We have chosen the delivery date to be in November and we are confident that we will manage this.
We also would like to point out that most of the footage shown in this campaign is from our alpha build, and there is a chance that some of the art may change. If so it will only be because we feel we can improve it, so the change will be for the better, while remaining in the same general style.",26.0,2,"1 Campaign

Years passed and telling about everything will make big enough book with a lot of useless writings and discussions about lost opportunities – whining to say the least. But today I'm not here for this.   What do we have today? Several people in whom I’m sure more than in myself and with whom I’m sure we can make things done. Friends and relatives that are interested in our work are ready to help. I can’t claim that we are professionals. World is enormous and is growing bigger every day, including us.  So the more we learn the more is left to learn but it is the best time in our lives! And I’m glad that I finally know what to devote my life to. If I didn’t tell already - to game development. I hope you will join and support us to make my dream come true.      I think it’s worth mentioning that I grew up on puzzle games. I like many genres and play then to this day. The main reason we want to create this game – because there are less puzzle games year by year.   ​Big studios with rare exceptions refuse such projects because they are not very profitable. While investigating deeper you can find out that sells of recent big projects are not that big as from games from other genres. It is the main reason for studios to avoid such projects and it is understandable. Soon I think such project would be possible only because people like you that can support an idea they like. By the way – idea of monetization in puzzle games disgusts me.    Right now, game is 30% complete in my opinion. We’ve worked out mechanics of some puzzles and work is underway on locations, models and textures. Plot and distribution of it on locations is done but while working out on locations it may change. Also, we are recording game sounds to imbue the atmosphere of the game. There is a lot to be made and a lot of obstacles to overcome but with your help we can make it! Down the road we are planning to enlist the support of a publisher to make releases on other platforms. We don’t have a lot of experience in working on other platforms so we can’t guarantee immediate releases on other platforms. At this stage we have made our “Steam” and “HumbleBundle” pages. Later we will send request to “GoG”. Game is planned for PC and we will do your best to make it for MAC too but we can't guarantee.https://store.steampowered.com/app/818090/Inner...​https://www.humblebundle.com/store/inner-riddle     With your help we are planning to release in December 2018. And only with your help release on other platforms is possible in such terms. But we can’t guarantee that releases on other platforms doesn’t take longer.(Budget percentages will slightly change depending on donations.)    We’ve began working on this project in the end of 2017 investing all your free time into it and all earned money into salaries and equipment. Right now, project is in critical stage. Collected funds will go to ensure different stages of development and generally to its acceleration. We have indicated minimal expenses on marketing because we plan to find a publisher that will take main load related with marketing on itself with leaving a reserve to hire marketing specialist if things won’t go that well. We hope it will help a lot of people to discover our game.      Here I’d like to be honest. I’m realist and everybody in our team are aware that we can’t afford few year development without funding. And even more so with such high risks in the genre like this. Right now, we are investing all our time and energy into development. I fully understand that team, even full of enthusiasm, without funding can’t risks a lot of time and energy to the pursuit of ambitions. All have their reasons – family, kids and so on. But with our team, experience, will to make it done and most importantly with your support we can create beautiful game.      We will keep you informed on news and stages of development in social media and your web site. Also, we will add new information to the project page.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Ready to play!</h2>
<p>We want you to be able to enjoy the full Android experience. With eSfere people will have access, from the first moment, to Google Play, the world’s largest Android app store, with over 500,000 titles.</p>
<p><strong>eSfere will allow you to play the latest AAA games, watch movies, surf the web and run all sorts of productivity, education or leisure apps. It will therefore be more than just a video game console.</strong></p>
<p>With eSfere game developers will discover a whole new way of conceiving their games. Since eSfere plays Android games downloaded directly from Google Play, developers don’t need to make special adaptations so they can run on the device. They can continue making their Android games as they normally do, but knowing that <strong>people will be able to enjoy them on a big screen with great graphics thanks eSfere’s Tegra 3 quad core processor</strong>. With this premise in mind they will be able to create more amazing Android games with engines such as Unity, Unreal, GameSalad or Multimedia Fusion 2.</p>
<p><strong><em>""As a game designer, I see eSfere as the ultimate incentive for Android game developers to envision their projects in a whole new way."" -- Ignacio Abad (2D &amp; 3D lead artist for ""Clive Barker's Jericho"" and ""Castlevania: Lords of Shadow"")</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Just a small sample of Android games available on Google Play that you will be able to play, from the very first minute, with eSfere:</strong></em></p>

<p> </p>
<h2> You're in control.</h2>
<p><span>eSfere will have a sophisticated and elegant multitouch game controller (“Touch&amp;Play”) that will <strong>allow people to keep the touch surface experience when playing their favorite Android games.</strong> Its accurate mapping system (a visual indicator showing on the TV where you are touching) will let you know at all times where you are located on the TV screen without having to look down at the controller, which will simply be a flat multitouch pad surface (with no images or video mirroring).

<p>Developing a gaming product of this level is a challenging task, but we have the tools and the people to make it happen.</p>
<p>Our team has ample experience in the gaming industry, both on a technical and a design level, having developed in the past entertainment software for PC, Mac, Android and iOS.

However, we are aware that technology keeps advancing and it is possible that an updated version of the Tegra processor might see the light over the coming months.

<h2><span> </span></h2></div>","Android gaming just got bigger.
Mobile apps have transformed the electronic gaming ecosystem. Each week thousands of new titles, with remarkable graphics and audio, are available for smartphones and tablets for low prices or even free. Why should we settle for playing them on a 4 inch, 7 inch or 10 inch screen device? Why can’t we enjoy our favorite games on our large screen TV at high quality without having to resort to home video game consoles and their high priced games?
 

Maximum power.
eSfere is an Android based video game TV console with impressive technical specs that will allow you to get the most out of thousands of titles available on the Google Play app store.
eSfere specifications:
- Tegra3 quad core processor or above 
- 2 GB RAM
- 16 GB internal flash storage
- 2 USB ports
- Bluetooth
- WiFi 802.11 b/g/n
- Ethernet
- HDMI connection for up to 1080p HD
- ""Touch&Play"" multitouch gamepad controller with integrated accelerometer and gyroscope
- Android OS 4.1
- Available in 7 different colors (black, white, pink, red, light blue, blue and yellow)







Ready to play!
We want you to be able to enjoy the full Android experience. With eSfere people will have access, from the first moment, to Google Play, the world’s largest Android app store, with over 500,000 titles.
eSfere will allow you to play the latest AAA games, watch movies, surf the web and run all sorts of productivity, education or leisure apps. It will therefore be more than just a video game console.
With eSfere game developers will discover a whole new way of conceiving their games. Since eSfere plays Android games downloaded directly from Google Play, developers don’t need to make special adaptations so they can run on the device. They can continue making their Android games as they normally do, but knowing that people will be able to enjoy them on a big screen with great graphics thanks eSfere’s Tegra 3 quad core processor. With this premise in mind they will be able to create more amazing Android games with engines such as Unity, Unreal, GameSalad or Multimedia Fusion 2.
""As a game designer, I see eSfere as the ultimate incentive for Android game developers to envision their projects in a whole new way."" -- Ignacio Abad (2D & 3D lead artist for ""Clive Barker's Jericho"" and ""Castlevania: Lords of Shadow"")
Just a small sample of Android games available on Google Play that you will be able to play, from the very first minute, with eSfere:
 
 ...among thousands
And your favorite apps too...

 
 You're in control.
eSfere will have a sophisticated and elegant multitouch game controller (“Touch&Play”) that will allow people to keep the touch surface experience when playing their favorite Android games. Its accurate mapping system (a visual indicator showing on the TV where you are touching) will let you know at all times where you are located on the TV screen without having to look down at the controller, which will simply be a flat multitouch pad surface (with no images or video mirroring). Using more than one controller will make it possible to play shared surface multiplayer games, where each player, via his/her own controller, takes control of a specific area or part of the screen. We understand however that many gamers demand physical buttons when it comes to playing video games. That's why eSfere will also include a set of detachable silicone buttons and directional pads which can be easily attached to the “Touch&Play” controller and adapted to whatever game you are playing.

Games like the <strong>TMNT</strong> beat' em ups, <strong>Battletoads,</strong> <strong>Prince of Persia</strong>, and <strong>Mortal Kombat,</strong> and even some more retro and obscure games like <strong>The Way of the Exploding Fist</strong> and <strong>The Way of the Tiger</strong> on the C64 and ZX Spectrum are being used as <strong>reference</strong>.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534973960/wlglwc81gelcjdfmmdjs.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535996128/i0rvrzzo2aq7k9jecgbc.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>We've always been huge fans of the Sega Mega Drive, we felt that it was the right thing to do to develop our first full game for this 16-bit system.</p><p>The game is currently at the <strong>aplha stage</strong> and we will release the finished game in <strong>December 2019, </strong>we want to <strong>have enough time</strong> to make everything according to our plan and <strong>test</strong> the game on as <strong>many different consoles</strong> as we can to <strong>ensure that it works properly</strong>.

<li>We have the <strong>knowledge</strong> and most of the <strong>resources</strong> needed to carry out the development (and with what we still lack you can help us ;P).</li>
<li>We find it much <strong>more attractive</strong> than developing a game to launch only on Steam or only on modern platforms.

We received some help recently and now we are able to add the Steam port for PC and Mac to our original goal.That means that all of our backers will receive a steam Key for Kung-Fu UFO on top of the other rewards once the game releases on this platform.Now people can get a copy of our game for $10. We believe that this adds a lot of value to all of our perks and it will motivate more backers to support our project.That also allows us to lower our stretch goals as well.Thank you very much for your help and support.    Kung-Fu UFO is a 16bit story driven adventure game heavily inspired by sci-fi and martial arts games and movies from the 80s and 90s. While not trying to emulate any existing titles it’s very important for us that Kung-Fu UFO looks and feels like a game released more than 20 years ago. We’ve taken inspiration from retro console and arcade games and also old movies to craft the gameplay, graphics, and story. Games like the TMNT beat' em ups, Battletoads, Prince of Persia, and Mortal Kombat, and even some more retro and obscure games like The Way of the Exploding Fist and The Way of the Tiger on the C64 and ZX Spectrum are being used as reference.   We've always been huge fans of the Sega Mega Drive, we felt that it was the right thing to do to develop our first full game for this 16-bit system.The game is currently at the aplha stage and we will release the finished game in December 2019, we want to have enough time to make everything according to our plan and test the game on as many different consoles as we can to ensure that it works properly. We're launching this Indiegogo campaign to fund the remainder of the development.Kung Fu -UFO has been playable on a few local and international events including Gamescom 2018. Soon to be shown in events in Spain and China.  We've already been featured on gaming sites like Homebrew Legends, Retromaniac, Tec Toy, Indie Retro News, Retro Video Gamer and One Angry Gamer.         Yong’s father left when he was just a baby. He grew up helping his mother on their humble farm just outside the city. Growing up in a little country from south america was not easy for a curious boy with asian traits, but Yong was happy with the little he had, playing soccer and wandering the streets with his friends.   One night a beautiful alien reaches out to him with a mysterious message just moments before a strange chinese looking bandit breaks into the house kidnapping Yong’s mother and leaving behind nothing but a weird map with an X marking a place very far away.Who is this mysterious bandit and what does he want with Yong and his mother? Why is an alien asking for his help? Our hero will need need to travel all around the world and beyond to solve a mystery, save his family, his planet, and maybe, just maybe, the whole galaxy.   Throughout the game the story will be told both by dialogues between the characters and with cutscenes which are being carefully planned and hand drawn before being turned into beautiful 16-bit art.     Kung-Fu UFO presents a very nostalgic mix between platformer and beat' em up genres that will feel both fresh and very familiar. The gameplay’s progression is very story driven and it includes exploration and some puzzle elements to solve on top of the jumping, climbing, and running.   No retro game is complete without ice levels… Right?    When it comes to dealing with those annoying bad guys we hand-crafted a fighting engine with kicks, punches blocks and combos that is very intuitive and can be simple or complex, depending on what the game needs and how you decide to play it. It will also include some very cool special attacks and powers to take care of the wide arrange of human and alien enemies.  This is a work in progress level on a dangerous alien planet. Challenging boss fights and bonus stages with different vehicles and gameplay styles will keep the game's pace varied and exciting and enhance the experience. This guy is definitely one of the game's bosses :P The game will keep you hooked while you make your way across 5 different levels with various stages, each containing a number of collectible items for you to find with some rewards and surprises for getting them all. Here's part of one of the levels This will be just one of many bonus stages that will include vehicles… VROOM! VROOM!  Need to run some errands? Don’t worry, the game will have a password system so you can continue where you left off, grab some pen and paper and write it down just like the old days (yeah or take a photo it also works but it’s not that retro you know).   

A 16-bit cartridge - Playable on SEGA Mega Drive and Genesis consoles and compatible clones (PAL, NTSC-US, NTSC-J)

16-bit pixel art - Beautiful hand crafted and animated graphics and cutscenes.

16-bit chiptune - A  rocking soundtrack with a variety of songs and tons of sound effects.

Story driven gameplay - That mixes different genres like platformer, beat’ em up, fighting and more.

A main character with lots of different moves - Kicks, punches, combos and special attacks and more to be unlocked as you make your way through the game.

Vehicles to drive and boss fights - Because running around all the time is not that fun, you'll also be able to drive a motorbike, a plane, and more... Stopping here and there to finish off some huge baddies in order to go on with the story.

Different stages - Not only graphically, but also in gameplay mechanics with bonus stages and huge levels for you to explore and clean out of enemies. Each level will have its own set of different enemies. Keeping the gameplay and the game's progression varied in every chapter from beggining to end. 

Difficulty levels - So anyone can enjoy and finish the game and everyone can set the bar to their preferred challenge.

Password system - Bringing back the almost forgotten yet thrilling experience of getting a pen and a piece of paper and writing down a code in order to be able to continue the game where you left off.  

An amazing cover art - made by Yayo our concept artist.
    Of course there is! We worked really hard to be able to show you at least a small piece of our game. You can download it by clicking the image below. It can be played in any SEGA Mega Drive / Genesis emulator or consoles using Flashcarts. Just click on the image below.Please have in mind that this demo is intended to give you an idea of what to expect of the final game but it does not represent the full experience since there are still missing features and lots of tweaking and fixing to do. It hasn't been extensively tested on all platforms so there might be some bugs... We can guarantee that they won't be there when we launch the final version.You can even play the demo on a Sega Nomad! Thanks to our friend Kent Campbell for this photo. It looks amazing.   
We love making and playing retro video games, it is an important part of our lives.
We love the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis, it is a great console with resources and limitations that will allow us to do exactly the game we want to do.
We have the knowledge and most of the resources needed to carry out the development (and with what we still lack you can help us ;P).
We find it much more attractive than developing a game to launch only on Steam or only on modern platforms. Definitely this development presents a series of challenges that we have been facing with pleasure and so we will continue until we see the finished product.
There is a large number of players and developers who enjoy this kind of videogames on retro consoles just like us, as well as on more current platforms and we want to be part of that great community.
 This might not be the final version, but it will give you a good idea of how the cover looks.   With hard work, effort and lots of passion.  It’s a long process and we need to be very careful in each step of the road. We have invested a lot of time into crafting the story and characters. Several hours have been spent sketching the characters and stages that will be featured on the game.The game’s development is being made with free and open source software and tools.The engine is being programmed mostly in Basic with some Assembler 68000 routines and later compiled in SecondBASIC (by Second Dimension).We also use custom software developed in PC and Amiga for managing graphics, stages, color palettes and much more.The pixel art graphics are carefully handcrafted from scratch or using hand drawn concept art as reference and always having in mind the console’s restrictions of tiles and sprites sizes, and color palettes and numbers.  Here are some game over sketches and the final pixel art that you can see in the game. The music is made in Deflemask Tracker and read by the console using the VGM2 driver.Sound effects are created both using DAW or generated by code.  Every new version of the game is properly tested not only in emulators but also in a variety of original and compatible hardware using custom cartridges and Everdrives.We have managed to gather many of the most commonly used Mega Drive and Genesis consoles (1,2, and 3) from different territories, and some of the most popular clones out there.  These will be used to test the different versions of the game through the whole development process  to ensure that it works and plays well regardless of the hardware. Same thing with the controllers, Kung-Fu UFO is being designed and tested with the 3 button pad and the 6 button pads and joysticks. We have also a large number of modern and CRT TVs displays and PVMs to ensure that the experience of playing Kung-Fu UFO is as close to playing a game made in the 90s as possible.  The development of the engine is in a very advanced stage and the main character has already been implemented almost in its entirety (missing some special powers and a few animations). What remains ahead is to add the different levels and stages as well as their respective enemies and bosses. The game in its current state can be played in emulators as well as in original SEGA hardware and compatible consoles. We trust that the rest of the development of Kung Fu UFO will not present major issues. Rain!!! Another work in progress feature made 100% with code.We are planning on adding different climatic changes throughout the game.   Sebastian Abreu “tacha”According to him, tacha learned to compose music while in the womb of his mother who was a pianist. He started using LOGO in the 90s and soon after started programming in BASIC and Assembler in a TK90 computer. In the middle of that same decade he switched to the ZX Spectrum where he continued creating programs and music in BASIC for the AY 3-8912 chip of that system. Programs music in a variety of Trackers some of them of his own authorship.He has worked as a music & sound designer for more than a decade, making cinema presentations in 5.1 Dolby Digital and TV commercials for more than 15 countries.He has officially composed Music&Sound for more than 30 videogames so far (physical bingo & slot machines, Android, PC and Commodore AMIGA)For 6 years he has been teaching at a video game development school. -Programmer - Musician - Retro console and retro computer collector - Exemplary father - Favorite Sega MegaDrive/Genesis game: Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic 2, Sonic 3, Final Fight CD, Battletoads, Virtua Racing, Ristar, Mickey Mania, Mega Turrican.  Javier Leal “Jav”Jav has worked as an artist and graphic designer since he was a teenager. He studied design, illustration, and animation in college; and he has more than 10 years of experience as an artist and game designer on dozens of video games for several platforms, both in 2D and 3D. He is one of the founding members of a company called Estudio Egg, which is dedicated to the development of educational and advertising games. He started with pixel art in MS Paint at the end of the 90’s and hasn't stopped since then. - Pixel artist - Game designer - Full time retro gamer - His desk is full of action figures - Favorite Sega MegaDrive/Genesis games: Blades of vengeance, Aladdin, Golden Axe, Castlevania Bloodlines, Chakan, Judge Dredd, Splatterhouse (all 3), Megaman The Willy Wars, World of Illusion, and Gunstar Heroes.   Luis Arellano ""Yayo""Yayo has been drawing for as long as he can remember. A mostly self-taught artist, he has had some studies in drawing and comics along with graphic design and digital art for some years. He took his first steps as a professional comic artist as an assistant and inker for independent publishers in the United States, and then went on to work on his own as an comics artist in his country and abroad. At the same time he developed a taste for video game conceptual art and reconstructive paleoart, in which he had the opportunity to work in recent years. - Concept artist and illustrator - Paleontologist wannabe - Manga geek - Loves dinosaur bootleg toys - Favorite Sega MegaDrive/Genesis game: Battletoads, Rocket Knight Adventures, Earthworm Jim, Zombies ate my Neighbors.   We’re also working closely with Adam Welch, the owner of Second Dimension and creator of SecondBASIC, the compiler that we are using to make our game playable on the consoles.Adam is also giving us a huge help with getting the game into actual cartridges providing us with the shells, memories, PCBs and more.  For more information, please visit: http://www.second-dimension.com Follow Second Dimension on Twitter and Facebook.   All backer's names will appear both game manuals the digital and the printed version. Luis Martins is the co creator of Chrono Trigger Resurrection and Co Creator/Art Director, Character/ pixel Artist of Paprium. He has worked in games such as Tomb Raider reboot, Rise Of the Tomb Raider, Deux Ex Mankind Divided, Watch Dogs 2 and many others as a Senior Lighting artist.   Note: the shown pixel art for the rewards are just for illustration purposes only, and does not represent the look of the final products.    Reaching this goal will allow us to port Kung-Fu UFO to mobile platforms like Android and iOS. Every perk will get a copy for the preferred platform if this goal is met.  With 50k we'll be able to improve the size of Kung-Fu UFO's cartridges up to 64 Megabits allowing the game to be the double of what we first intended meaning it wil have more content, art and cutscenes... We are really hoping for this.  If we hit this stretch goal we are goint to invest in Second Dimension to develop a SNES compiler that will be available for free just like the Mega Drive / Genesis one that we are using to make Kung-Fu UFO. Also we promise to port Kung-Fu UFO to SNES cartridges that will be available for purchase after all of the other versions are released... Wouldn't that be awesome? Let's make this happen!!!  If you want to keep up with our project and interact with us while we make the game please follow us on: http://twitter.com/retronerve  https://www.facebook.com/retronerve  https://www.instagram.com/retronervegames  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo1pO54thENwEz...  https://www.patreon.com/retronerve And visit our website http://retronerve.games  RISKS AND CHALLENGESMaking videogames is not an easy task and making a retro game for a 30 year old console is a huge challenge and that’s why we are doing this… Challenges are fun, videogames are fun both to make and to play. For us the most difficult part is this one, the funding.We have the experience and knowledge to complete the project, we managed to put together a demo that runs smoothly on cartridge in the original hardware and all that you see here with very little to no resources and once we reach our goal we are confident that the rest of the development process will be just more of what we have already done but a lot easier.Besides… We are working with the help of some amazing friends and people that have been lending a hand through the development of the project and will continue to do so and that gives us a lot of confidence. SPECIAL THANKSA huge thank you to our Patrons. Without you guys we wouldn't have made it this far and we are really thankful for your help and support.Very special thanks to Natalia and Paola our always supporting and loving wives.Thanks to Adam Welch for being the coolest dude and helping us so much. To Gabriel and Silvestre from XUruguay for helping us promote our project to more people.Thanks to all of our friends that have been there since the beginning of this journey.

<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>In Artificer's Forge you play as a Mage who crafts and sells magical goods, by filling in personal requests or making wondrous items that absolutely must be bought! Item crafting comes in a form of puzzle solving and time management. So, if the idea of solving puzzles, being efficient, and coming up with your own recipes sounds fun to you, this is certainly your game.</p>
<p>You start off as a low level mage, making menial items for the common folk in the forms of work fulfillment quests to get your start. As you progress you'll be able to craft more interesting and higher quality goods that make it even more tempting to purchase outside of your work orders. Quests will help you progress in the game, but making rare and unique items is where you'll get your highest returns either in terms of currency or unique items you cannot obtain otherwise.</p>
<p>To be more specific about item creation itself, it is a mix of both management of your space and putting together the right regents. It starts by setting each machine to a number of items it will accept once the number of items have been placed in the machine, it will make  the item that corresponds with the provided materials. Items are not place in your inventory immediately and must be removed from conveyor belts in a timely manner to avoid overflowing piles of goods. The main puzzle is making production stays at a consistent, manageable pace while making effective use of storage. You need enough inventory to keep up with demand, but not so much you're overwhelmed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501102245/kzjbz1nmbn9qyr44j0lt.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501102363/rcmcldebolsfw8gmyzmr.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501102371/xpnublnuuibjim3p6s9a.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501102379/uqosaafjnpjrk9lvdjbv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To aid you in your craft, you may summon minions to do your bidding for you, gathering goods based on what they are and what you fuel them with. Using your golems will be a separate game from your usual crafting, and they're your primary means of gathering materials. As of this time the extent of golem combat has not been completely determined but it will either be passive or something more akin to a mini game.</p>

<p>Machines are also crafted to speed up your work and make greater quality goods, but will require management and balancing. Trading for required regents or possibly even tools or machines will be an important factor to progress in your game. Both your Golems and Machines will need to be upgraded in order to keep up with your growing business, so you'll need to make sure you have enough materials for both upgrades as well as production.</p>
<p>The Game is made in unity3D. It will be from the 2D perspective and made with the sprites above, as well as sprites of machines. The items being processed will float along magic chutes going from machine to machine and being processed.</p>

<h3>Our Goals &amp; Wishes</h3>
<p>The game is currently scheduled to be in a playable beta state in about 6 months and released on Steam Early Access at that time. What this campaign would help us with, is getting the game completed much sooner as well as help our team focus on the game. And by much sooner, we mean as soon as 2 months if we reach our goal! </p>
<p>To get an idea of where we are at now, we have our design outline, detailing the basic mechanics and layout. We are still determining the nature of content as we build our testing prototype. Our GDD is thus partially finished, and we’re still testing out the basic mechanics. We have a very sparse overworld map and tower inside, as well as the classes for resources and resource generation.</p>
<p>Since we believe it's important to have an enjoyable game first, core mechanics such as the crafting engine will be what we focus on first. The UI is also of utmost importance as we wish for the player to know exactly what they're looking at and what to do. Next will be game elements to add more complications such as random caravan events and even possibly rival competition. Lastly, with time and funding, we can add flare to the game such as customization for your Avatar, the tower itself and other elements.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Funding Choices &amp; Rewards</h3>
<p>The funding for this project is set to Flexible, meaning we will keep all donations. Regardless if we meet our goal or not, the game will be completed, it's not a project that will disappear.</p>
<p>As for what you get for supporting us, for small amount backers, the only thing we can offer is our thanks. Those that back a certain amount will be provided a key to Steam Early Access as soon as it gets approved.</p>

<p>Drone Wars inspiration came from a video in which drones tied up with fireworks were used for air battle. This is awesome! I want to do it，too! But we were not satistied with tinding up fireworks with the drones – it is easy to crash and tedious. So, I had to find a safer and fun way. After a period of researching, planning and testing, Drone Wars was finally born.</p>

<p>Drone Wars is an AR drone air battle game. It has PVE mode and online PVP mode. As you can see in the trailer, the real-time flight data is called to directly simulate game contents, enemy planes, cannons and interface on returned vedio.</p>
<p>The controlling method is through drone remote control. The targets are locked automatically first, then the cannons and missiles are launched automatically. Of course, you can switch to manual launch mode.</p>
<p>Apart from the things mentioned above, it also features:</p>
<p><strong>●Cannons</strong></p>
<p>Currently, 6 kinds of cannon are available with different ""Damage"", ""Range"", ""Rounds"", ""Reload Time"" and ""Weight"".</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Drone Wars inspiration came from a video in which drones tied up with fireworks were used for air battle. This is awesome! I want to do it，too! But we were not satistied with tinding up fireworks with the drones – it is easy to crash and tedious. So, I had to find a safer and fun way. After a period of researching, planning and testing, Drone Wars was finally born.



Drone Wars is an AR drone air battle game. It has PVE mode and online PVP mode. As you can see in the trailer, the real-time flight data is called to directly simulate game contents, enemy planes, cannons and interface on returned vedio.
The controlling method is through drone remote control. The targets are locked automatically first, then the cannons and missiles are launched automatically. Of course, you can switch to manual launch mode.
Apart from the things mentioned above, it also features:
●Cannons
Currently, 6 kinds of cannon are available with different ""Damage"", ""Range"", ""Rounds"", ""Reload Time"" and ""Weight"".

Take a look at how your drone looks like with the cannons↓


It's pertty cool I think.
●Missiles(AAM)
Currently,  8 kinds of missile are available with different ""Damage"", ""Tracking"", ""Speed"", ""Range"", ""Lock"", ""Lock Time"", ""Reload Time"" and ""Weight"".

 
●Assist
It Includes 3 types of radars and decoy flares.

 
●Carrying load
Your drone is designed with carrying load capacity. Every weapon comes with a different weight hence choose them depending on your specific situations.

 
●Coins
At the beginning of each game, 1000 coins are available for you to buy initial weapons in the hangar. During the game, you can earn more coins by picking up and shooting down enemy planes. You can buy weapons at check points.
 


Released date: October 2017
We are currently working on PVE mode. PVE mode includes 4 types: ""Dogfight""(completed), ""Defense"", ""Assassination"" and ""General War"". Then the project will enter multiplayer online mode development. At the latest, we will start multiplayer online mode beta test in September. The official release will be published by the end of October. At that time, you can fight with players from all around the world.



Note: Can't find your drones here? Don't worry. We are working on it. Maybe the next is yours!


Note: Cannon F cannot be used due to the design problems in DJI PHANTOM series drone.

<p><br/><a href=""http://fastmoneypoker.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FastMoneyPoker.com</a> is an innovative entertainment company started to fill a void in the free play and subscription poker, games and entertainment market. While other companies offer game-play sites, none of them focus on the community and social aspects of such an entertainment site. It is this aspect, along with several cross-promotional opportunities, that will allow <a href=""http://fastmoneypoker.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FastMoneyPoker.com</a> to become a market leader in a short amount of time. The Company will launch with a unique advantage of having an established customer base already in place, giving it yet another edge in the marketplace. Beginning with a proven and scalable poker platform, the Company will provide legal poker games and tournaments for free and will provide additional benefits to subscribers that pay a monthly fee to win prizes under a sweepstakes model. <br/><br/>Subscription Poker :<br/><br/>Subscription poker is a proven business model that is legal in the United States. Based upon Sweepstakes law, players are never asked to make a deposit and never make a wager. An alternative means of entry (AMOE) is allowed, such as sending in a postcard to subscribe. This allows prizes to be given away in the many states that allow such sweepstakes. After substantial legal analysis, we will allow subscriptions from 38 states. Residents of all 50 states can play for free. By allowing members to play unlimited games for a base monthly fee, it allows an inexpensive form of entertainment. In the current economy, people have less discretionary income and look for value in their entertainment offerings, which we can provide.<br/><br/><br/>Product:<br/><br/> The end-user product is very important to any software or website.<a href=""http://fastmoneypoker.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FastMoneyPoker.com</a> will be branded, and have a unique look and feel, but will function in a similar fashion to other club poker rooms allowing for easy customer usability. We have acquired software that will allow 10,000 (on one server) simultaneous players.  The software is customizable by the user to allow for the best player experience in online club poker today, and the graphics, interface, and ease of use are unlike any competitor in the market. The software has the ability to incorporate all client languages. For example, a member residing in Europe that speaks Chinese can view our entire website in Chinese and download the poker software interface in their native language. This will greatly assist us in marketing globally. In addition, the software is written utilizing current state of the art technology, unlike most software platforms that are five years old or older. <a href=""http://fastmoneypoker.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FastMoneyPoker.com</a> is a social community site that allows members to:<br/> • Write Blogs • Post Pictures • Share Videos • Live Chat • Post in Forums • Learn Poker • Rankings and Leader boards • Search for Friends • Post Avatars<br/><br/>Social play: <br/><br/>*IMPORTANT* <br/><br/>- Before you look at the pledge rewards and then read this, I want to clear the air. This is the ONLY time you can receive chips for pledging. We will NOT sell play chips to players. This is not where our source of revenue comes from. I personally believe in the social aspect of poker and believe that if you obtain 1 million chips, it's because the player has skill. This is one of the greatest incentives I could think of.

FastMoneyPoker.com is an innovative entertainment company started to fill a void in the free play and subscription poker, games and entertainment market. While other companies offer game-play sites, none of them focus on the community and social aspects of such an entertainment site. It is this aspect, along with several cross-promotional opportunities, that will allow FastMoneyPoker.com to become a market leader in a short amount of time. The Company will launch with a unique advantage of having an established customer base already in place, giving it yet another edge in the marketplace. Beginning with a proven and scalable poker platform, the Company will provide legal poker games and tournaments for free and will provide additional benefits to subscribers that pay a monthly fee to win prizes under a sweepstakes model. Subscription Poker :Subscription poker is a proven business model that is legal in the United States. Based upon Sweepstakes law, players are never asked to make a deposit and never make a wager. An alternative means of entry (AMOE) is allowed, such as sending in a postcard to subscribe. This allows prizes to be given away in the many states that allow such sweepstakes. After substantial legal analysis, we will allow subscriptions from 38 states. Residents of all 50 states can play for free. By allowing members to play unlimited games for a base monthly fee, it allows an inexpensive form of entertainment. In the current economy, people have less discretionary income and look for value in their entertainment offerings, which we can provide.Product: The end-user product is very important to any software or website.FastMoneyPoker.com will be branded, and have a unique look and feel, but will function in a similar fashion to other club poker rooms allowing for easy customer usability. We have acquired software that will allow 10,000 (on one server) simultaneous players.  The software is customizable by the user to allow for the best player experience in online club poker today, and the graphics, interface, and ease of use are unlike any competitor in the market. The software has the ability to incorporate all client languages. For example, a member residing in Europe that speaks Chinese can view our entire website in Chinese and download the poker software interface in their native language. This will greatly assist us in marketing globally. In addition, the software is written utilizing current state of the art technology, unlike most software platforms that are five years old or older. FastMoneyPoker.com is a social community site that allows members to: • Write Blogs • Post Pictures • Share Videos • Live Chat • Post in Forums • Learn Poker • Rankings and Leader boards • Search for Friends • Post AvatarsSocial play: *IMPORTANT* - Before you look at the pledge rewards and then read this, I want to clear the air. This is the ONLY time you can receive chips for pledging. We will NOT sell play chips to players. This is not where our source of revenue comes from. I personally believe in the social aspect of poker and believe that if you obtain 1 million chips, it's because the player has skill. This is one of the greatest incentives I could think of. I just want to state and make everyone aware that play chips will NOT be available for purchase.

<p>Our reason for starting this project is simple: watching movies or playing games at home becomes a matter of routine. We all do it the same way: passively. But who hasn't dreamt of riding the hoverboard in <i>Back to the Future</i>, piloting one of the pod racers in <i>Star Wars</i> or even feeling the vibration of a machine-gun while playing an FPS game?</p>
<p>We became frustrated by the fact that the only 4D simrides were only professionnal and ridiculously expensive (read: tens of thousands of dollars) and were so complex to use. They often require a specific computer, drivers and a huge amount of space.</p>

<p>The idea behind Immersit was to keep this level of sensations with an easy to use device, that is autonomous, intelligent and totally adaptable to your living space ... your couch.<br/>In 2015, we decided to come up with a solution to this problem ourselves, and we are now ready to share it with the world. </p>

Immersit, a plug & play device installed under your couch, can generate a very high amount of movement patterns and vibrations ranging from explosive to subtle: pitches, rolls & heaves, moving users back & forth, from side to side and up & down. All these, combined with intelligent vibrations and an adjustable intensity, result in the ultimate movie and gaming experience in which each explosion, wave & sharp turn is felt directly by the user from his own furniture.
In the press

""SPOILER : IT WAS PRETTY COOL."" - Engadget


""My palms were surprisingly sweaty"" - The Verge


""A furniture add-on that will change the way you play games."" - UbergizmoThe genesis. 
Our reason for starting this project is simple: watching movies or playing games at home becomes a matter of routine. We all do it the same way: passively. But who hasn't dreamt of riding the hoverboard in Back to the Future, piloting one of the pod racers in Star Wars or even feeling the vibration of a machine-gun while playing an FPS game?
We became frustrated by the fact that the only 4D simrides were only professionnal and ridiculously expensive (read: tens of thousands of dollars) and were so complex to use. They often require a specific computer, drivers and a huge amount of space.





The idea behind Immersit was to keep this level of sensations with an easy to use device, that is autonomous, intelligent and totally adaptable to your living space ... your couch.In 2015, we decided to come up with a solution to this problem ourselves, and we are now ready to share it with the world. 
For us, it is a kid's dream come true.



 

Step inside your favourite game. 
Immersit is a fully functionnal device that comes with sophisticated motion hardware and software that makes it ready to play right out of the box, with many games.  Using different signal combinations, Immersit automatically recognizes the game status and the movement to create. You are 100% in control of the movements, if you'd rather have a specific movement during a specific action, simply set it in the app where you are able to customize your gaming experience to your liking.
Right now, Immersit is compatible with X-Box (One, 360), Playstation (3 and 4), PCs and over 120 different games.
Live your favourite movie. 
Immersit is the ultimate enhancement for movie lovers as it breathes new life into old films. Imagine seeing some of the most timeless movies again and living the experience as if you were watching them for the first time. New releases will be even more thrilling.
Beforehand, our software translates movie motions into perfect movements and vibrations to get you immersed in the most appropriate manner. Our team then verifies and modifies those motion codes if needed so that each action is perfectly translated into the right motion. 

At home Immersit uses a combination of different technologies to recognize any media being played on your monitor regardless of the sources ( DVD, Blu ray player, VOD platform and so forth). Once the movie is recognized,  the couch then starts moving and vibrating in a synchronized manner with the on-screen action.  
Immersit is for your body what VR is for your brain. 
2016 is the year of Virtual Reality. Unfortunately VR doesn't provide you the full experience. It successfuly tricks your brain into thinking you are elsewhere, but your body can not be tricked without real physical signals.





Now imagine the sensations you could have  if you mixed the best VR headsets with Immersit. Your body would send the right signal to your bain, that would correspond with what you see, hence giving you the full virtual experience. Imagine being on a roller coaster, feeling the drop approaching and the sensation in your stomach as your couch tilts forward. 


Re-live your own personnal adventure the right way. 
What if you could live your own personnal adventure again and again months after it happened? Whether you're a ski fan, a VTT rider or a skydiver you will have access to our consumer motion platform where you will be able to customise your own motion code for your Go Pro or 360 videos and share the sensations and thrills with your friends & family.

<h2><strong>The Game:</strong></h2>
<div><strong>Overview:<br/></strong></div>
<div>
<strong><br/></strong>Incarnot is a RPG single player or Co-op RPG series set in the distant future,  where resources are scarce and the human race is no longer a thriving society. Players will choose between multiple classes from the Saverian Elite force of Human/Cyborg hybrids fuelled by Steam Power. Players will have the opportunity to build and evolve their hero over the course of the series.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Plot:</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>Since the wars for resources known as the Carbon Wars, the human race has been left shattered and broken. The remaining population has banded together under the Saverian Banner (adopted from one of the pioneers of the early steam engine, Thomas Savery), in the hope to rebuild a once great society. Unfortunately, due to oil reserves completely drying up, Saverian scientist have been working tirelessly to find an alternate fuel source. This has led to the construction a once obsolete technology from the past, the steam engine.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately, this technology was inefficient and unpredictable which made it dangerous and time consuming to maintain.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then the first discovery of a never seen before mineral was made. A green mineral with unusual energy properties, that when infused with steam enables the engines to work at a high performance rate.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/588687/pictures/original/20121219171000-steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_112875322_preview.png?1355965799"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The need for Carnotium, as it is now been named (based on the Carnot Heat Engine theory), created a new market as the price for this mineral sky rockets. A new age of prospectors and miners are now spreading out into the barren wastelands in search for the mineral. Settlers are expanding out beyond the main cities , building trade routes through vast empty territory.</div>
<div> </div>

The Game:
Overview:

Incarnot is a RPG single player or Co-op RPG series set in the distant future,  where resources are scarce and the human race is no longer a thriving society. Players will choose between multiple classes from the Saverian Elite force of Human/Cyborg hybrids fuelled by Steam Power. Players will have the opportunity to build and evolve their hero over the course of the series.
 
Plot:
 
Since the wars for resources known as the Carbon Wars, the human race has been left shattered and broken. The remaining population has banded together under the Saverian Banner (adopted from one of the pioneers of the early steam engine, Thomas Savery), in the hope to rebuild a once great society. Unfortunately, due to oil reserves completely drying up, Saverian scientist have been working tirelessly to find an alternate fuel source. This has led to the construction a once obsolete technology from the past, the steam engine.
 
Unfortunately, this technology was inefficient and unpredictable which made it dangerous and time consuming to maintain.
 
Then the first discovery of a never seen before mineral was made. A green mineral with unusual energy properties, that when infused with steam enables the engines to work at a high performance rate.
 
 

 
The need for Carnotium, as it is now been named (based on the Carnot Heat Engine theory), created a new market as the price for this mineral sky rockets. A new age of prospectors and miners are now spreading out into the barren wastelands in search for the mineral. Settlers are expanding out beyond the main cities , building trade routes through vast empty territory.
 
However, not long after the discovery, news of skirmishes between the mining villages and a demon like threat have surfaced along the trade routes. Eye witnesses are telling of being ambushed by creatures that appears to be attracted to the Carnotium stores. They infuse the Carnotium within themselves making them faster, stronger and increasingly powerful.
 
The Saverians ruling body have enacted a plan to combat these unknown forces they have since named 'The Spawn', due to their abilities to spawn lesser beings at will.
 
The maimed prospectors have been fitted out with tech body parts and AI to replace their missing limbs. These will be the elite soldiers that will take on this new threat and win the war for human survival.

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are Mutations Studio, a professional team of smartphone game developers. We’re hungry, determined, and obsessed with making fun games, and we want people to know it.<br/>
We believe that fun is something that people value, and that it can be the driving force in the market. We decided on our name because we want to “mutate” the games put out there, steering them in an even more fun direction, and that’s what we fight for day and night.<br/>
At Mutations Studio, we now have a game that we want not only gamers in Japan to play, but gamers around the world. That game is <a href=""http://www.worldwartitan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WORLD WAR TITAN : FRONT LINE</a>, and we want to create it together with you.<br/><br/></p>
<h2>What’s WWT?</h2>
<p>Any current-day gamer is familiar with MOBA games like League of Legends and DotA. After all, it’s said that there are over 70 million MOBA game accounts on the PC market.<br/>
While we understand how fun it can be to spend the day in front of your PC with a bottle of your favorite caffeinated beverage, racking up pentas, we also wondered if we could bring the excitement of the MOBA experience to smartphones--a game you can hop into while under your sheets before you go to bed.<br/>
To put it simply, we want WWT to be the LoL of the smartphone market. We think we can do that with the game’s unique, smartphone-oriented system that enables short games, its intuitive and simple controls that anyone can pick up, and its cool designs.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668844/files/20140623081300-2014-06-23_21.29.42.png?1403536380"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
<h2>We want you to help us make WWT even better!</h2>
<p>When we sat down and started to think about how we, a Japanese game studio, could make WWT a game that could be enjoyed by all of you around the world, we found there was one thing we wanted to do over all else.<br/>
The idea is simple. We want to make this game together with our fans by listening to what gamers around the world have to say and creating connections with them.<br/>
There are tons of MOBA players around the world, but sadly, there are still few in Japan. That’s why we’re looking beyond our borders and to the world! But how can we gather and connect with fans across the globe? Of all the choices out there, we decided that Indiegogo was our best option.<br/>
This might sound strange, but what the primary thing we’re seeking though this Indiegogo campaign isn’t funding. It’s for you to become a fan of WWT and our partners in its creation.<br/>
To do that, we’re going to share with you the development status of WWT during the beta test, and we’re also going to create a community where gamers, MOBA lovers, and WWT fans can share their honest opinions with us. MOBAs are still unusual in Japan (especially smartphone MOBAs!), as are gaming communities, but we want to create both.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/667993/files/20140623005523-artwork_map.jpg?1403510123"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
<h2>We want gamers around the world to be able to enjoy WWT!</h2>
<p>We’re a collective of game developers who are also true gamers. We don’t want to make yet another mobile game that’s been focus-grouped for the Japanese market. We want to make a smartphone game that isn’t afraid to take risks, and we’re confident we can make a quality game that gamers will want to play.<br/>
That’s the reason why we want to bring WWT beyond Japan and into your hands around the world, too, and that’s why we’re here on Indiegogo: to make WWT a global game.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/667992/files/20140623005515-artwork_heishi2.jpg?1403510115"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
<p>We’ve gotten a little long-winded, but thanks for reading this far. Now, for what you’ve really been waiting for, an overview of the game. If you’ve made it this far, trust us--you’ll want to read to the end.</p>
<p><br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/664213/files/20140621001444-midashi_1.jpg?1403334884"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
<h3>Innovative battle system featuring Titans</h3>
<p>The most unique element of WWT’s game system has to be its Titans. Think of them as kings in chess. Titans aren’t playable characters. They’re NPCs that move on their own, but how you use them determines who will be victorious in battle.</p>
<p>While Titans are a key part of any victory, their fearsome power isn’t only aimed at your enemies--you can find yourself on the receiving end, too! Let down your guard for even a moment, and you might meet a grisly end as your own Titan tramples over you.</p>
<p>Players can choose from a variety of classes and skills to create their own customized characters. Fight together with your allies to keep the enemy Titan from advancing while protecting your own!<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668855/files/20140623081457-artwork_screenshot_2-1.jpg?1403536497"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668860/files/20140623081644-2014-06-23_20.28.26.png?1403536604"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Unique, awe-inspiring Titan character designs</h3>
<p>The artist who is designing these Titans isn’t your run-of-the-mill game designer, either. We’re working with leading special effects makeup artist, modeler, and design artist Tomo Hyakutake, known for his work on major Japanese movies such as GOEMON and Resident Evil: Degeneration.</p>
<p>We think you’ll understand once you see his artwork, but the game is full of fresh, imaginative, and unique Titans depicted in fine detail.</p>
<p>We’re confident that the Titans’ unique nature and their overwhelming sense of scale will make WWT’s visuals unlike anything else you’ve seen on smartphones.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/667987/files/20140623005324-artwork_kyojin_1.jpg?1403510004"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Choose from different 3 nations and fight for supremacy in the Great War mode!</h3>
<p>WWT’s world has a World War I-themed motif, and the game takes place between three major nations. Players fight alongside their guildmates in a battle for power in World War mode. Guilds belong to one of the three nations, and they fight in order to contribute to their nation’s success.</p>
<p>Each individual battle will affect the larger situation as nations dominate, struggle, and compete. Victory conditions and rules in individual battles will constantly shift depending on the larger situation, allowing players to enjoy a wide variety of battles.</p>
<p>After each World War event is over, the country with the most points wins. Polish and refine your team’s skills to earn honor and glory!<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/667991/files/20140623005507-artwork_heishi1.jpg?1403510107"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Form a guild and battle your way to the top of the leaderboard</h3>
<p>The game also comes with a guild system that MMO players should be familiar with. The most important thing in WWT is teamwork. Members of the same guild can gather in a lobby whenever they like and chat. Team up with as many as 5 of your friends and put your knowledge, experience, and gaming skills to the test in battle.</p>
<p>You can check battle results through the in-game leaderboard and compete against other guilds for the top rank. You and your guildmates can work together to climb your way up the divisions and ranks.</p>
<p>In the future, we plan to hold tournaments and other competitive events. Just imagine how exciting it would be to play in a global official tournament!<br/><br/></p>

We are Mutations Studio, a professional team of smartphone game developers. We’re hungry, determined, and obsessed with making fun games, and we want people to know it.
We believe that fun is something that people value, and that it can be the driving force in the market. We decided on our name because we want to “mutate” the games put out there, steering them in an even more fun direction, and that’s what we fight for day and night.
At Mutations Studio, we now have a game that we want not only gamers in Japan to play, but gamers around the world. That game is WORLD WAR TITAN : FRONT LINE, and we want to create it together with you.
What’s WWT?
Any current-day gamer is familiar with MOBA games like League of Legends and DotA. After all, it’s said that there are over 70 million MOBA game accounts on the PC market.
While we understand how fun it can be to spend the day in front of your PC with a bottle of your favorite caffeinated beverage, racking up pentas, we also wondered if we could bring the excitement of the MOBA experience to smartphones--a game you can hop into while under your sheets before you go to bed.
To put it simply, we want WWT to be the LoL of the smartphone market. We think we can do that with the game’s unique, smartphone-oriented system that enables short games, its intuitive and simple controls that anyone can pick up, and its cool designs.

We want you to help us make WWT even better!
When we sat down and started to think about how we, a Japanese game studio, could make WWT a game that could be enjoyed by all of you around the world, we found there was one thing we wanted to do over all else.
The idea is simple. We want to make this game together with our fans by listening to what gamers around the world have to say and creating connections with them.
There are tons of MOBA players around the world, but sadly, there are still few in Japan. That’s why we’re looking beyond our borders and to the world! But how can we gather and connect with fans across the globe? Of all the choices out there, we decided that Indiegogo was our best option.
This might sound strange, but what the primary thing we’re seeking though this Indiegogo campaign isn’t funding. It’s for you to become a fan of WWT and our partners in its creation.
To do that, we’re going to share with you the development status of WWT during the beta test, and we’re also going to create a community where gamers, MOBA lovers, and WWT fans can share their honest opinions with us. MOBAs are still unusual in Japan (especially smartphone MOBAs!), as are gaming communities, but we want to create both.

We want gamers around the world to be able to enjoy WWT!
We’re a collective of game developers who are also true gamers. We don’t want to make yet another mobile game that’s been focus-grouped for the Japanese market. We want to make a smartphone game that isn’t afraid to take risks, and we’re confident we can make a quality game that gamers will want to play.
That’s the reason why we want to bring WWT beyond Japan and into your hands around the world, too, and that’s why we’re here on Indiegogo: to make WWT a global game.

We’ve gotten a little long-winded, but thanks for reading this far. Now, for what you’ve really been waiting for, an overview of the game. If you’ve made it this far, trust us--you’ll want to read to the end.


Innovative battle system featuring Titans
The most unique element of WWT’s game system has to be its Titans. Think of them as kings in chess. Titans aren’t playable characters. They’re NPCs that move on their own, but how you use them determines who will be victorious in battle.
While Titans are a key part of any victory, their fearsome power isn’t only aimed at your enemies--you can find yourself on the receiving end, too! Let down your guard for even a moment, and you might meet a grisly end as your own Titan tramples over you.
Players can choose from a variety of classes and skills to create their own customized characters. Fight together with your allies to keep the enemy Titan from advancing while protecting your own!



Unique, awe-inspiring Titan character designs
The artist who is designing these Titans isn’t your run-of-the-mill game designer, either. We’re working with leading special effects makeup artist, modeler, and design artist Tomo Hyakutake, known for his work on major Japanese movies such as GOEMON and Resident Evil: Degeneration.
We think you’ll understand once you see his artwork, but the game is full of fresh, imaginative, and unique Titans depicted in fine detail.
We’re confident that the Titans’ unique nature and their overwhelming sense of scale will make WWT’s visuals unlike anything else you’ve seen on smartphones.



Choose from different 3 nations and fight for supremacy in the Great War mode!
WWT’s world has a World War I-themed motif, and the game takes place between three major nations. Players fight alongside their guildmates in a battle for power in World War mode. Guilds belong to one of the three nations, and they fight in order to contribute to their nation’s success.
Each individual battle will affect the larger situation as nations dominate, struggle, and compete. Victory conditions and rules in individual battles will constantly shift depending on the larger situation, allowing players to enjoy a wide variety of battles.
After each World War event is over, the country with the most points wins. Polish and refine your team’s skills to earn honor and glory!




Form a guild and battle your way to the top of the leaderboard
The game also comes with a guild system that MMO players should be familiar with. The most important thing in WWT is teamwork. Members of the same guild can gather in a lobby whenever they like and chat. Team up with as many as 5 of your friends and put your knowledge, experience, and gaming skills to the test in battle.
You can check battle results through the in-game leaderboard and compete against other guilds for the top rank. You and your guildmates can work together to climb your way up the divisions and ranks.
In the future, we plan to hold tournaments and other competitive events. Just imagine how exciting it would be to play in a global official tournament!

is an Arabian inspired survival game for the Oculus Rift. Think
Minecraft meets DayZ meets the Middle East, but with Ghuls and Djinn
instead of Zombies or Creepers.You can download the latest alpha demo and try it for yourself here : 

The
player character (Left) is in a constant struggle with the Ghuls
(Right) who prey on wandering travelers. 
I'm
a huge fan of MineCraft and DayZ and they are my primary influences.
I wanted to create a game that embodies the spirit of those games,
but takes place in a setting that people don't often explore much
outside of stereotypes.
You
find yourself in a land not your own, with no prospect of finding out
who you were. You are forced to forge ahead and create a new life.
You'll have to scavenge, craft, trade, and fight to stay alive in
this harsh environment. 


Back
in September I invited the guys at IGN Middle East to come check out
the Rift and Atajrubah. I thought they just wanted to check out the
Oculus Rift, but to my surprise they came down to do an article on
Atajrubah and not the Rift! It was a very humbling experience to say
the least.If you're interested, you can check out that
article at the link
below.http://me.ign.com/en/feature/14974/meet-atajrubah-the-middle-east-themed-game-for-the-oculus-rift

My
Name is Alan Robinson. I'm a visual effects artist and indie
developer living in Abu Dhabi, a city in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE).I started working on the game in February of 2013. At
first it was only me working on it. I had to wear a lot of hats and
it was a huge relief when more people started helping me out.Now
there are seven of us working on the game. I work on the game full
time, and the other team members help out when and where they can.
I'm very grateful for them! We're
big believers in emergent game-play - the experiences that come from
players interacting with the world and with each other. We want to
expand player impact on the environment and its inhabitants far as we
can. 

We
are well aware that our modest $10,000 goal is not enough to take the
game all the way to completion. It is, however, enough to help us get
the game into online beta. Once in online beta, we'll be able to
hear and process more feedback, bringing us greater insight into what
players want to see in the game.
Right
now the game is still far from complete. We have an alpha demo
with prototype crafting and survival mechanics, day/night cycles,
creature AI and a large landscape for the player to explore.We've
laid out a variety of rewards that we hope will appeal to everybody.
We want as many people as possible to get their hands on the game.
You can get the basic alpha package for as little as $5 and some of
the perks available include:- Beta Access + Deep discount on
future commercial release.- A 5 track score composed for the
Beta by the talented AJ.Lournie at Forte Sounds Ltd.- A high
resolution concept art E-Book with concept art from the Beta development process.- Exclusive monthly pre-Beta builds,
where your feedback will help shape the game!
Every
dollar you contribute goes towards helping us build an Beta with a
strong core game play experience. This includes the following:-
Commissioning an amazing , Arabian inspired sound track for the game.                  -
Developing a flexible and intuitive UI and Menu system.-
Commissioning more character and creature models to populate the
world.           - Commissioning more concept art to help us shape the
world.      - Commissioning more environment art assets.         -
While I am a competent programmer, I simply do not have enough
experience with sql databases and network programming. Your
contributions will help me bring a network programmer on board who is
more experienced with this side of things.If we don't reach
our goal we don't get anything !

We want to create an engaging experience for players, while promoting cross-cultural learning through play.

Providing a stereotype and religion free environment where players can explore and experience a world inspired by another culture, its folklore, architecture and language.

The other team members and I love games, game development and flexing our creative muscles. Atajrubah gives us an outlet to continue doing so and keep our passion alive, while building a community and an experience that's bigger than us.

<p>The dance-floor shouldn't be a show-floor for the next big AAA flop, and we shouldn't have to wait in line for ""open"" bars that turn out to be anything but. We’ve all been to these big publisher parties, and they are what they are, but we can do better. We don’t have to have our celebrations revolve around products.</p>
<p>Indie developers showed us that they don't need a publisher to create great entertainment, and that independence doesn’t just apply to games. In the indie spirit, we're taking back creative control of how we party.</p>
<p>Together let’s make the alternative that we deserve, <em>The Indie After Party</em>.</p>
<p><strong>WHY INDIEGOGO?</strong></p>
<p>There can be no owners. This party is about all of us, and we can only make it happen together. As soon as a party is about a company or a product it becomes just an opportunity to sell you something.</p>
<p>This is why we’re using IndieGoGo. It’s important that you know that you had a direct hand in making it happen, so that we all know that the only motive is having a great party. Yes, our names are on this IndieGoGo campaign and we’re organizing it, but our motivation is no different than yours: to go to <em>The</em> <em>Indie After Party.</em></p>

<p>The pledge amount for the INDIE SUPPORTER tier was set as the minimum needed to cover the cost of the venue and performers based on 200 attendees. By backing at the $57 level you gain entry to <em>The Indie After Party</em>, a digital copy of the making-of documentary, a special MP3 collection featuring the artists from the concert, and access to the photo-stream featuring pictures and videos that you provide.</p>
<p><br/><span>While 200 is our minimum, the maximum we can accommodate and keep the venue comfortable is 350 attendees, and because of that the tier is limited to 350 backers. If you want to party with your friends, make sure that they all back quickly.</span><br/><br/><span>Not only will maxing out the capacity mean we have more people to share this incredible experience with but also allows us to unlock additional stretch goals for everyone’s benefit.

<li>$24,000 - The only one that matters: open bar all night long.</li>
</ul><p><strong>INDIE EVANGELISTS</strong></p>
<p>In Humble Bundle style, we’re leveraging the functionality of IndieGoGo which allows you to pledge at any amount above the minimum. By pledging more than $57 in the INDIE SUPPORTER tier, we can hit those stretch goals sooner, making the party better for everyone, and it gives you the opportunity to become an INDIE EVANGELIST.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: at the end of the campaign, the 25 funders who contributed the most in the INDIE SUPPORTER tier will be declared the INDIE EVANGELISTS. The ranking will be updated daily for everyone to see where they stand, giving you the chance to reclaim the top spots if dethroned.</p>
<p>In an attempt to honor the INDIE EVANGELISTS who could contribute more so that everyone can have a better time, we will have special perks for them, which include:</p>
<ul>

CONCEPT: The Indie After Party is a private event for gamers, by gamers. 21 and over only, must bring ID.
DATE & TIME: September 1st, 9 PM 'til 2AM.
PLACE: Baltic Room. Fantastic layout. State-of-the-art sound system. Located two blocks from the convention center. Best of all, not a hotel ballroom.
REFRESHMENTS: Open bar until midnight. No digging for cash, no carrying around tickets, just go to the bar and order. Yes, seriously.

<p><strong>Easy to play, hard to master.</strong></p>
<p>Nubiah is a <strong>new and tricky strategy game</strong> for 2 people, which demands tactical moves. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479551501/ucvvrqmwvj9xfpahbnsx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The clever and easily understood gameplay offers an even playing field for <strong>players of all ages</strong>. For that reason,<strong> nubiah attracts</strong> both young and old strategic game enthusiasts. Whether it be the short game in between or a challenging one to boost the brain power, <strong>nubiah will mesmerize you.</strong></p>
<p>Nubiah's game mechanics have already impressed numerous people and are reminiscent of the award-winning strategy game Abalone.</p>
<p><strong>How it all began</strong></p>
<p>Nubiah was developed by Joachim in 2000 and <strong>was very successful</strong> on a regional level.  Together with his father and grandfather Joachim produced and self-published the first nubiah games. </p>
<p>To date, Joachim has received <strong>demands for nubiah</strong> over and over again. He decided to produce and publish nubiah again with a <strong>new design</strong> and in collaboration with a<strong> local carpenter</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How to play</h3>
<p>The player, who brings all tiles of his color into the board first, wins.</p>
<p>Start the game by inserting one of your tiles anywhere on the board regardless of the direction. The red-brown tile, pushed out of the board, is taken out of the game. Now it is the second player’s turn. Insert one of your tiles on the board.</p>
<p><strong>The three major rules:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If there is an opponent's tile in the selected row, you are only allowed to insert your tile, if the sum of your pips including the pips of the chosen tile, is higher than the opponents sum in that row. Blank tiles have the value zero and do not increase the sum of the pips.<br/> </li>
<li>If a player's tile is pushed out of the game during a turn, it must be taken back by the player of the respective color and brought back into the game.<br/> </li>
<li>Every player is compelled to move, which might mean you are forced to push out one of you own tiles and take it back. </li>
</ul>
<p>The game continues in this manner.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The player who inserts the</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> last tile on the board, wins and ends the game.</span></p>

About nubiah
Easy to play, hard to master.
Nubiah is a new and tricky strategy game for 2 people, which demands tactical moves. 

The clever and easily understood gameplay offers an even playing field for players of all ages. For that reason, nubiah attracts both young and old strategic game enthusiasts. Whether it be the short game in between or a challenging one to boost the brain power, nubiah will mesmerize you.
Nubiah's game mechanics have already impressed numerous people and are reminiscent of the award-winning strategy game Abalone.
How it all began
Nubiah was developed by Joachim in 2000 and was very successful on a regional level.  Together with his father and grandfather Joachim produced and self-published the first nubiah games. 
To date, Joachim has received demands for nubiah over and over again. He decided to produce and publish nubiah again with a new design and in collaboration with a local carpenter. 
 
How to play
The player, who brings all tiles of his color into the board first, wins.
Start the game by inserting one of your tiles anywhere on the board regardless of the direction. The red-brown tile, pushed out of the board, is taken out of the game. Now it is the second player’s turn. Insert one of your tiles on the board.
The three major rules:

If there is an opponent's tile in the selected row, you are only allowed to insert your tile, if the sum of your pips including the pips of the chosen tile, is higher than the opponents sum in that row. Blank tiles have the value zero and do not increase the sum of the pips. 
If a player's tile is pushed out of the game during a turn, it must be taken back by the player of the respective color and brought back into the game. 
Every player is compelled to move, which might mean you are forced to push out one of you own tiles and take it back. 

The game continues in this manner.
The player who inserts the last tile on the board, wins and ends the game.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hi there! I'm Nuno, and I have always loved videogames. I have been making games making for a while now, released 10 and I'm now ready to take on a bigger project and launch my first commercial project.</p>
<p>I'm here to ask the Indiegogo community for support to help me released my first commercial game. It has always been my dream to create a game worthy of a big platform, like Steam!</p>
<p>Mutation Miracle is 2D Plarform Shooter game where every kill you make changes the way the game works. You can become small, your bullets can deal more damage, the enemies can explode, the gravity can be nullified, you never know what is going to happen when you kill an enemy! There are tons of characters to unlock and dozens of different maps.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570298778/rg6v38qhwuij6okbfb0g.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/KbkIju7huGzQfrSiuJ/source.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moving on to funding. I need about 800€. This money will be used to buy gear that will make Mutation Miracle's quality improve drastically. For example, a music program, a MIDI keyboard, a microphone (and maybe some art programs). The money will also help to pay the 100€ fee to put the game on Steam, and buy a camera so I can make regular devlogs to show you all how the development of this game is going. In exchange for your amazing help, you get unique and awesome perks! Starting with your name in the credits of the game and of the videos I will make, you can also get a Steam Key for a discount price and access to the Mutation Miracle Discord, or the Steam Key with the Original Soundtrack (also at a discount a price). The Double Mutation Supporter tier includes 2 Stean Keys with the OST (so you can share the with a friend), your name in the credits, access to the game's Discord and exclusive Beta Testing! The Enemy Mutator Designer, Level Mutator Designer, Level Mutator Designer tiers are different, because you can directly take part of this game's development, since you can design an enemy, a character skin or a level, respectively! Now the Miracle of Mutation Miracle tier is for very special and generous people: you get ALL the previous rewards, but you can design and enemy AND a character skin AND a level! In addition to this you also get an Exclusive Signed Postcard with a heart-felt thank you! Also, I really want to meet you, so we can schedule a private Discord / Skype Call so we can talk about whatever you want!</p>
<p>In case the funding is unsuccessful, I will take what was raised of the flexible goal and buy the gear in order of importance.</p>

<p>Making a game solo is always hard, let alone a full commercial game. However, I have what it takes to make this come true. I am perseverant, determined and creative. I'm sure that are things I don't know about game development, but I'm also sure I will learn them along the way. Your support, feedback and critique will also be crucial for the success of this game. I might add that I have already released 10 small games and have never given up on a project.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>How cool is it when you find out say your local doctor or congressman might be a gamer. Better yet if they are actually any good! or even if you guys might have gone a few rounds online and didn't even know you were playing each other.</p>
<p>What if gaming was the new golf? </p>
<p>Are you excited about the intersection of gaming tech where those skills transfer directly into real life skill and work? </p>
<p>Balance is a professional social network for the other 80% of gamers or so that either aren't all about e-sports and aren't unemployable slackers either.  It's for those that refuse to give up gaming and ""grow up"" and continue to game even as we struggle to find as much time for it as we get older. This is also a platform where we can bring in some of the excitement of esports without having to compete against others who have dedicated their lives to it.  What if your gaming hobby could lead to useful business connections and support and grants for your ambitions as well. We are about realizing gaming for the asset of a hobby it could actually be.</p>
<p>At the same time we will bring to the community the opportunities for ""Joes"" to compete with the Pros to both learn from them and to get crushed by them at the same time ;)</p>
<p>For a $10 monthly fee you get access to the network, tournaments and event prize eligibility but also monthly digital swag and merch. We have a goal of potentially offering an indie game or equivalent in virtual goods to all of our members every month even as we scale.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to it than that but should whet your appetite. For more information on the specifics as well as on the 8k VR headset partner that we are co-launching with check out our website at </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.balancegaming.network/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.balancegaming.network/</a> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The most important thing is to validate that others find the concept as full of potential as we do and it doesn't take a whole lot. <strong>The most important thing is to get your commitment of $10 to prove this is something you are potentially willing to pay for</strong>.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>30k only really just gets the ball rolling if we are actually aiming to use Indiegogo to get us beyond just market validation.  Everything from prize pools to events will be treated strategically on a per event basis.

<p>100k-300k - Part time expenses covered for everyone over the next 6 months with an immediate international focus with non-English speaking regions included from day 1.

<p>1 million (per year run-rate) - Full time expenses covered.

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We don't see much in the way of early risks or challenges other than slow growth or weak adoption. Being able to reach out and acquire as many gamers who also have strong professional backgrounds enough to make the network interesting (students are okay too!) will be the most difficult challenge but not so much with adequate funding. We believe growth will eventually drive itself if the network itself has value and the value of the partner benefits will be able to rise as well in terms of a virtuous circle.</p>
<p>The brilliance of this concept is that we don't need to build much technically from being able to leverage our various partnerships already and we are already have an accomplished network of people between the game industry, tech worlds, influencers and esports.</p>
<p>In the long run the biggest challenge will be how to ensure every subscriber sees some value as our subscribers scale into the millions, we may not be able to offer enough benefits for everyone.

</div></div>","Overview
How cool is it when you find out say your local doctor or congressman might be a gamer. Better yet if they are actually any good! or even if you guys might have gone a few rounds online and didn't even know you were playing each other.
What if gaming was the new golf? 
Are you excited about the intersection of gaming tech where those skills transfer directly into real life skill and work? 
Balance is a professional social network for the other 80% of gamers or so that either aren't all about e-sports and aren't unemployable slackers either.  It's for those that refuse to give up gaming and ""grow up"" and continue to game even as we struggle to find as much time for it as we get older. This is also a platform where we can bring in some of the excitement of esports without having to compete against others who have dedicated their lives to it.  What if your gaming hobby could lead to useful business connections and support and grants for your ambitions as well. We are about realizing gaming for the asset of a hobby it could actually be.
At the same time we will bring to the community the opportunities for ""Joes"" to compete with the Pros to both learn from them and to get crushed by them at the same time ;)
For a $10 monthly fee you get access to the network, tournaments and event prize eligibility but also monthly digital swag and merch. We have a goal of potentially offering an indie game or equivalent in virtual goods to all of our members every month even as we scale.
There's a lot more to it than that but should whet your appetite. For more information on the specifics as well as on the 8k VR headset partner that we are co-launching with check out our website at 
https://www.balancegaming.network/ 
What We Need & What You Get

The most important thing is to validate that others find the concept as full of potential as we do and it doesn't take a whole lot. The most important thing is to get your commitment of $10 to prove this is something you are potentially willing to pay for. Everything else is either a perk or a way to provide even more support for us. We will have an alpha network up by November and start some test events and tournaments (with prizes) even this month in October.
$30k to get us going for 6-12 months in a bare bones fashion is great but that's secondary to having the concept validated via as many contributors as possible for showing to investors. With the team and partners we have assembled we need a lot more than just $30k to cover everything we're trying to achieve but that's not what we are looking for from a crowdfunding standpoint.  Buying a headset from our store on our official website also gets us going a lot faster as aside from Balance, we are also participating in Skyworth VR's entry into the US and international western markets. 
Perk wise any contributions now are eligible for ALL preliminary events, member benefits, prizes etc until the end of the year before official launch Xmas '19 or January 2020.
If we don't meet our goal , the funds will still towards helping all activities that result in either growth or sales to bootstrap directly from customers and future subscribers as much as possible without outside funding

The Impact
30k only really just gets the ball rolling if we are actually aiming to use Indiegogo to get us beyond just market validation.  Everything from prize pools to events will be treated strategically on a per event basis. Spending will be careful to ensure each dollar can potentially grow us further organically. At least $1k of validation here can potentially get us this in outside funding
However what might be possible if we can reach new supporters outside of our immediate social networks are also hitting our pre-seed and seed goals for outside funding. These are :-
100k-300k - Part time expenses covered for everyone over the next 6 months with an immediate international focus with non-English speaking regions included from day 1. The beginning of a prizes and benefits budget that we cover ourselves without being compensated via sponsorship. At least $5k of validation here can potentially get us this in outside funding
1 million (per year run-rate) - Full time expenses covered. We can start to push forwards on other services and businesses related to this as well as start offering some of the larger professional support rewards from our partners our of our own pockets. As little as $5-20k of validation here can potentially get us this in outside funding

Risks & Challenges
We don't see much in the way of early risks or challenges other than slow growth or weak adoption. Being able to reach out and acquire as many gamers who also have strong professional backgrounds enough to make the network interesting (students are okay too!) will be the most difficult challenge but not so much with adequate funding. We believe growth will eventually drive itself if the network itself has value and the value of the partner benefits will be able to rise as well in terms of a virtuous circle.
The brilliance of this concept is that we don't need to build much technically from being able to leverage our various partnerships already and we are already have an accomplished network of people between the game industry, tech worlds, influencers and esports.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">With your help, we'll be able to professionally design and manufacture 4 unique Nintendo Switch compatible Pro Controller shells, representing iconic characters, costumes and designs from the LoZ series.

Being able to fund not only this project and the backer rewards, but also be able create a back stock of product to continue selling long after the campaign is over will eventually give me the ability to transition all of my work from hand painted to mass produced. This is something that no other custom controller company does, giving us the unique opportunity to bring amazing custom products to gamers at unbeatably low prices you wont find from anyone else. </p>

During this night, the Outer Gods can enter our realm. But they need some help from the inside. A dangerous and challenging magic ritual called the Great Game can decide whether the Gates will open wide, allowing the Outer Gods to walk the Earth again, or stay sealed until the next special full moon. The strongest occultists, witches, magicians, mediums, and even mythical creatures (such as vampires and werewolves) flock to the place of the ritual to play their part in it. The ritual requires coordinated participation of two warring parties/Players who usually have different motivations to choose a side.

Therefore, inventing a magic system was an important task.</p><p>The first idea was to borrow rituals from different variations of the Necronomicon. Many authors tried to recreate this forbidden book: such works as Al Azif and The Simon Necronomicon are especially worth mentioning.

Ultimately, everything was brought together via Chaos Magic, special thanks to Peter Carroll and his Liber Null. Chaos Magic is a modern syncretic occult school that allows the mage to choose their symbolic language, invent new rituals and spells, or give different meanings to existing ones. That’s exactly what we needed to do.</p><p>The core of our magic and combat system is a Hexagram. There are planet symbols around it, and each symbol is related to a certain magical, or, if you like, psychological phenomenon. Each ingredient that can be found in the game contains two primary elements.

To achieve this sound, Oskar layered sampled and synthetic instruments with his recordings of real Celesta and Dulcitone, two rare instruments with an eerie sound.

The game has a procedurally generated narrative and vintage hand-tinted silent movie aesthetics.Two groups of cultists confront each other: the Changers are summoning the Outer Gods, while the Keepers are trying to stop them. All cultists meet in a small town and prepare for the Final Ritual that takes place on Halloween’s full moon. Each cultist has an animal familiar, and their combinations may differ from game to game, creating unpredictable alliances.We already have raised some funds during a successful Kickstarter and would like to continue here, on InDemand, to achieve more stretch goals.You can read our old Kickstarter updates to learn our crowdfunding story. When the full moon falls on Halloween, the boundaries between the worlds become thinner. During this night, the Outer Gods can enter our realm. But they need some help from the inside. A dangerous and challenging magic ritual called the Great Game can decide whether the Gates will open wide, allowing the Outer Gods to walk the Earth again, or stay sealed until the next special full moon. The strongest occultists, witches, magicians, mediums, and even mythical creatures (such as vampires and werewolves) flock to the place of the ritual to play their part in it. The ritual requires coordinated participation of two warring parties/Players who usually have different motivations to choose a side. Finding out who is on which team is an essential part of the game.The overall setting of the game is mostly Lovecraftian, but playable characters come from many other authors, such as Abraham Merritt, Gustav Meyrink, and Bram Stoker.

<h2><strong>You've got your PS3, you've got your 3D game. Now what?</strong></h2>
<p>You are a hard core gamer. You've got your PS3, you've got your game with a 3D sticker on it, now what? You may have one of those sleek flat screen TVs you bought a few years ago when being flat was <em>THE</em> thing. But now it's just that - flat, and that's boring. You know there is a better way. You've seen 3D movies, you may have played 3D games in store demos and you know how cool it is. It's no longer about watching it, it's about <em><strong>experiencing</strong> </em> it, it's about being there - in the game, it's about seeing the distance, moving through space, feeling the enemy hiding behind that wall with your skin. </p>
<p>We are gamers like you, we want to experience the games we play to the fullest, like millions of others gamers. And like most of you we are stuck with that good old flat TV in our living room that we weren't thinking of upgrading any time soon. But we have been working on something, a cool little gadget, that will unleash the awesomeness of 3D games for you.</p>
<h2><strong>Don't try that at home</strong></h2>
<p>When you stick your 3D game into your PS3, then go to the game settings and tell it to switch to 3D, your PS3 will start sending the so called stereoscopic Frame-Packed 3D signal through its HDMI output. If you have your regular TV connected to your PS3 it will most likely just go blank because it can't handle that signal. And you might get really hosed at that point because you won't even be able to switch the game back to 2D (your TV is blank, right?). Turning the PS3 off and on and/or re-ejecting the CD won't help because that thing is smart to remember its settings. That happened to me once and I had to delete all game data form my PS3 to be able to play the game again.</p>
<h2><strong>Not ready to upgrade to a 3D TV yet? Don't - there is a better way.</strong></h2>
<p>Most of our professional career Jack and I have been involved with cutting edge video technologies, and we know who is who in that industry. One day our paths crossed with the company <a href=""http://www.movidius.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Movidius</a>. They know everything about 3D and they developed an amazing technology that adds another dimension to everything flat and makes things jump out at you. </p>
<p>Among many things their technology can enable there is one thing that we'll love as gamers: it makes your 3D game play in full 3D on your regular TV. Yes, seriously. We want to build a gadget with that technology inside and we know how to do it.</p>
<h2><strong>What exactly does it do?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>3D Game Converter</strong> - the gadget we are going to build with your help - goes in between your PS3 and your regular TV. In other words one HDMI cable connects the output of your PS3 to the input of the gadget. Another HDMI cable connects the output of the gadget to your TV. When connected that way <strong>3D</strong> <strong>Game Converter</strong> does two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>it makes sure your TV never goes blank (it will never send a signal that your TV can't handle)</li>
<li>whenever the PS3 outputs stereoscopic Frame Packed 3D signal, the <strong>3D game Converter</strong> converts it to so called Anaglyph 3D signal. For your TV it doesn't look any different from a regular 2D signal (that's why it won't go blank), but for you it will provide the full 3D experience if you look at your TV screen through the special glasses <strong>3D Game Converter</strong> will come with.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: for better experience close the curtains and turn your lights down. That's what they do in movie theaters  - turn the lights off before the movie starts because they want you to get the best viewing experience.</p>
<h2>Where will your money go?</h2>
<p>Movidius developed the technology and we built the prototype. There is still some work to be done to turn it into a robust and polished product that works 100% of the time. That involves some development and a lot of testing (Daniel and Alex will be helping here big time).  Then we need to build it which means we need to buy the parts and pay the manufacturer. And these guys don't build just one unit at a time - they need some reasonable quantity. That's why we are asking for $180,000 which will cover the remaining development and all the costs to build first 3000 units. If you pledge enough you'll be the lucky one to get one of those units in your hands!</p>
<h2>Why we think we can do it?</h2>
<p>Before 3ality Jack and I have built and shipped (in millions) all kinds of video gadgets (you may even have some of them at home if you ever wanted to do anything with video). So we know very well how that cool stuff is getting made. Here are some of the gadgets we built:</p>

<p>Jack also was an initial founder for Convert23, an early leader in 2D to 3D video conversion. The Convert23 team was involved in the initial patents for 2D to 3D conversion more that 15 years ago. Convert23 software and leading hardware designers developed many of the initial video 2D to 3D video conversion algorithms, powerful chips for video processing, and anaglyph 3D glasses development.</p>
<h2>How soon you'll get your 3D Game Converter?</h2>
<p>We need 60 days to complete the development and build 3000 units. So you'll be getting your <strong>3D Game Conveter</strong> in February 2013 (given of course that this projects reaches its funding goal).</p>
<h2>Rewards</h2>
<p>If you are one of the 10 first ones to pledge $49 you'll get the real thing - the fully functional 3D Game Converter with glasses and HDMI cable. If you come in a bit later (but not too much later - you've got until the 3rd week of December) you will need to pledge $59 to get the same. But even at $59 it's a very sweet deal considering that when we start selling this product in retail (and this is our plan) the price is going to be somewhere around $129.  </p>
<p>And another reference point for you: how much do you pay for a new game? With sales tax and everything it's over $60, right? So would you rather buy one more game or spend that money (or even less) on something that will change your gaming experience forever?</p>
<p>If you don't want the real thing and just want to help us out, we still got something for you as a token of our gratitude for your kindly contribution. For $15 or more you get one of these really cool T-shirts. Just let us know what color you would like: black or white.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3><em>Q. What are the technical specs?</em></h3>
<p>(Somewhat) technical specs. </p>
<ul>
<li>Converts PS3 3D content to Anaglyph-3D format for viewing on 2D TV</li>
<li>Automatically recognizes PS3 3D movie or game content</li>
<li>Passes through all other PS3 content</li>
<li>1 HDMI 1.4a compatible output port to TV</li>
<li>1 HDMI 1.4a compatible input port</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Q. What's included in the package? </em></h3>
<p>The basic package contains one 3D Game Converter unit with power supply, one pair of glasses and one HDMI cable.</p>
<h3><em>Q. What wil the 3D Game Converter retail for? </em></h3>
<p>When we start mass producing the 3D Game Converter it will be sold online at $100. So you are getting a very nice discount by backing the project.</p>
<p><em>Q. Will we ship internationally? </em></p>
<p>Of course we will...gamers are everywhere. Shipping costs outside the US are  listed for each of the rewards.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Q. Can I order multiple units?</strong> </em></h3>
<p>Yes, you can. There are 5 pack and 8 pack rewards. If you want to buy just a couple multiply the single unit pledge amount by the number of units and enter it as your pledge. Feel free to contact us to make sure we got you down for that number of units.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Q. Is it easy to set up? </strong></em></h3>
<p>Yes, all you have to do is connect two HDMI cables: one from PS3 to the 3D Game Converter and another from the 3D Game Converter to your TV. You should already have one cable (that's how your PS3 is currently connected to your TV) and we will send you another one. Oh yeah, and don't forget to connect the power supply to the wall outlet and plug the other end into the unit.</p>
<p>One more thing - for best viewing experience try to create a ""movie theater"" environment by closing the curtains and dimming the lights.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Q. Do I need to control 3D Game Converter?  </strong></em></h3>
<p>Nope, 3D Game Converter is smart enough to detect when your PS3 is sending 3D signal and will switch to Anaglyph 3D automatically (and back to 2D when you exit the game).</p>
<h3><em><strong>Q. Are there any buttons or remote control? </strong></em></h3>
<p>No, nothing to control, everything is automatic.</p>
<h3><em><strong>Q. What is Anaglyph 3D?</strong> </em></h3>
<p>From wikipedia:  Anaglyph 3D is the name given to the stereoscopic 3D effect achieved by means of encoding each eye's image using filters of different (usually chromatically opposite) colors, typically red and cyan. Anaglyph 3D images contain two differently filtered colored images, one for each eye. When viewed through the ""color coded"" ""anaglyph glasses"", each of the two images reaches one eye, revealing an integrated stereoscopic image. The visual cortex of the brain fuses this into perception of a three dimensional scene or composition. IMPORTANT: 3ality uses more sophisticated ""Tea-Blue"" implementation of Anaglyph 3D that produces much better color reproduction and overall image quality than traditional ""Red-Cyan"" implementation. </p>

Camera Mate Video Editor and Publisher, and PCMCIA card reader produced and shipped by Jack while at Zio Corp.
Jack also was an initial founder for Convert23, an early leader in 2D to 3D video conversion. The Convert23 team was involved in the initial patents for 2D to 3D conversion more that 15 years ago. Convert23 software and leading hardware designers developed many of the initial video 2D to 3D video conversion algorithms, powerful chips for video processing, and anaglyph 3D glasses development.
How soon you'll get your 3D Game Converter?
We need 60 days to complete the development and build 3000 units. So you'll be getting your 3D Game Conveter in February 2013 (given of course that this projects reaches its funding goal).
Rewards
If you are one of the 10 first ones to pledge $49 you'll get the real thing - the fully functional 3D Game Converter with glasses and HDMI cable. If you come in a bit later (but not too much later - you've got until the 3rd week of December) you will need to pledge $59 to get the same. But even at $59 it's a very sweet deal considering that when we start selling this product in retail (and this is our plan) the price is going to be somewhere around $129.  
And another reference point for you: how much do you pay for a new game? With sales tax and everything it's over $60, right? So would you rather buy one more game or spend that money (or even less) on something that will change your gaming experience forever?
If you don't want the real thing and just want to help us out, we still got something for you as a token of our gratitude for your kindly contribution. For $15 or more you get one of these really cool T-shirts. Just let us know what color you would like: black or white.

FAQ
Q. What are the technical specs?
(Somewhat) technical specs. 

Converts PS3 3D content to Anaglyph-3D format for viewing on 2D TV
Automatically recognizes PS3 3D movie or game content
Passes through all other PS3 content
1 HDMI 1.4a compatible output port to TV
1 HDMI 1.4a compatible input port

Q. What's included in the package? 
The basic package contains one 3D Game Converter unit with power supply, one pair of glasses and one HDMI cable.
Q. What wil the 3D Game Converter retail for? 
When we start mass producing the 3D Game Converter it will be sold online at $100. So you are getting a very nice discount by backing the project.
Q. Will we ship internationally? 
Of course we will...gamers are everywhere. Shipping costs outside the US are  listed for each of the rewards.
Q. Can I order multiple units? 
Yes, you can. There are 5 pack and 8 pack rewards. If you want to buy just a couple multiply the single unit pledge amount by the number of units and enter it as your pledge. Feel free to contact us to make sure we got you down for that number of units.
Q. Is it easy to set up? 
Yes, all you have to do is connect two HDMI cables: one from PS3 to the 3D Game Converter and another from the 3D Game Converter to your TV. You should already have one cable (that's how your PS3 is currently connected to your TV) and we will send you another one. Oh yeah, and don't forget to connect the power supply to the wall outlet and plug the other end into the unit.
One more thing - for best viewing experience try to create a ""movie theater"" environment by closing the curtains and dimming the lights.
Q. Do I need to control 3D Game Converter?  
Nope, 3D Game Converter is smart enough to detect when your PS3 is sending 3D signal and will switch to Anaglyph 3D automatically (and back to 2D when you exit the game).
Q. Are there any buttons or remote control? 
No, nothing to control, everything is automatic.
Q. What is Anaglyph 3D? 
From wikipedia:  Anaglyph 3D is the name given to the stereoscopic 3D effect achieved by means of encoding each eye's image using filters of different (usually chromatically opposite) colors, typically red and cyan. Anaglyph 3D images contain two differently filtered colored images, one for each eye. When viewed through the ""color coded"" ""anaglyph glasses"", each of the two images reaches one eye, revealing an integrated stereoscopic image. The visual cortex of the brain fuses this into perception of a three dimensional scene or composition. IMPORTANT: 3ality uses more sophisticated ""Tea-Blue"" implementation of Anaglyph 3D that produces much better color reproduction and overall image quality than traditional ""Red-Cyan"" implementation.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Inspirations</strong></p>
<p>As I said previously I am a huge fan of RPGs/MMORPGs and have been playing them for over 7 years. Games that I think have definitely inspired the art are games such as Ragnorak and Maplestory online. These are games I used to love to play when I was younger and I have always loved the pixel style artwork. I love the fantasy worlds that are created with RPGs, the weird and wonderful monsters, the awesome armours and weapons and the scenic landscapes you are able to wander. I've always wanted to be able to create my own fantasy world and A Jumpers Tale is definitely a way to do so.</p>
<p>In the past couple of years since I have owned a smart phone I have loved playing games such as Doodle Jump and Temple Run. These games have had me hooked for hours trying to compete with friends to gain new High scores  I also love the fact that you can pick up and play these games at any point – on the bus or train or even when you just have a few minutes spare.</p>
<p>I think all my inspiration has definitely come from my experience with RPGs throughout my life and the recent love for endless runners and platform jumpers as well the idea of pick up and play casual gaming.</p>

<h1>Yes, this is 100% real.</h1>
<p>The cards are real, and they're spectacular.</p>
<h1>How does it Work?</h1>
<p>It's very simple. Your card is delivered to you in a ""Safe mode"". Here you can start and stop the song as much as you want. After you sign the card with a lovely message, pull the activation tab inside the card which will activate the card. Then slide it into an envelope and deliver! </p>

</div>","Yes, this is 100% real.
The cards are real, and they're spectacular.
How does it Work?
It's very simple. Your card is delivered to you in a ""Safe mode"". Here you can start and stop the song as much as you want. After you sign the card with a lovely message, pull the activation tab inside the card which will activate the card. Then slide it into an envelope and deliver! 


You want Proof?
Some people may doubt our card can go as long as 3 hours, here's a vid using an early prototype where it goes for nearly 5 hours. Please watch all 5 hours of it! It's highly entertaining.

Is it a Well Made product?
 Travis put it to the test and dunked it a few times in a bucket of water. Did it survive? Watch and find out.

Does it survive the mailman? 
We always recommend sending in boxes! Protect the card and mail men and women won't. However we did test them many other ways. 
We tested this a few time already but we finally recorded the experience. Travis sent Nick 10 envelopes in the mail from Irvine to Los Angeles and we even waited an extra week to open them. Watch video to see how it ends.

<p>Hope, that breaks it down clearly enough (haha pun!). The more money we get, the better quality we can deliver! And each donation will already reward you with perks in the app!<br/><br/>We want the app to be free, but to make money with it to donate to charities and fund future developments, there'll be in-app purchases and we plan on putting one or two ads in it. Once you made a small in-app purchase (OR picked one of the perks here), the ads will be deactivated for you. If you wish you can turn them back on. Some people like it.</p>
<p>You will use cookies as virtual currency to fill each others windows. You'll have plenty of them and when you need more they'll be easy to get.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/863799/files/20140917075743-cookie-haufen.png?1410965863"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 231.020408163265px; height: 120px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>The problem is, that we estimated server costs and cannot make everything infinitely free. The more users, the more costs. And we don't know yet if the ad-revenue can counter that.</p>
<p>If the funding here is super successful, we will consider kicking the cookies out' the window and make everything free.</p>
<p>Yes, if we do not accomplish our funding goal, we will still give our best to release the app and probably even give the perks to those of you who contributed even after you got your money back. Seems like the nice thing to do!</p>

</div></div>",": What's the idea!?
 : A social advent calendar app!
: What's an advent calendar!?: Where we come from (Austria), it is customs to buy (or build) special calendars for the last 24 days before Christmas Eve, which vary in shapes and sizes. Each day is represented by a window in which a surprise is hidden. Once it is that day, you open it up and find something in it!
: Sounds awesome! And what does it mean, ""you want to make it social""!?: Usually, you buy a calendar with pre-filled windows, or parents build one for their children and stuff some unhealthy sweets in each day. So it's kind of a one-to-one fun.We are building an app which does the same trick, only healthier and everyone can fill each others calendars!
: Why are we shouting!?: I don't know!! It's supposed to look exciting I guess!You can put one message in each window of a friend, but lots of friends can do that for you. So on each day you can have several surprises from different people!


You can only open a window once it's that day in December!It's all about Anticipation! 
: Who are you?: We're three guys from Austria, studying IT stuff at university and want to try our own things.
: What do you need us for? (The  is you btw): Help! We don't have any funds besides our unmeasurably worthy time, which sadly doesn't pay for infrastructure.: Is your english really that bad (see video)?: I hope not, but sometimes stereotypes are funny.





: What will you use our money for? 
: See this incredibly accurate pie chart...


Hope, that breaks it down clearly enough (haha pun!). The more money we get, the better quality we can deliver! And each donation will already reward you with perks in the app!We want the app to be free, but to make money with it to donate to charities and fund future developments, there'll be in-app purchases and we plan on putting one or two ads in it. Once you made a small in-app purchase (OR picked one of the perks here), the ads will be deactivated for you. If you wish you can turn them back on. Some people like it.
You will use cookies as virtual currency to fill each others windows. You'll have plenty of them and when you need more they'll be easy to get.

The problem is, that we estimated server costs and cannot make everything infinitely free. The more users, the more costs. And we don't know yet if the ad-revenue can counter that.
If the funding here is super successful, we will consider kicking the cookies out' the window and make everything free.
Yes, if we do not accomplish our funding goal, we will still give our best to release the app and probably even give the perks to those of you who contributed even after you got your money back. Seems like the nice thing to do!




: What will we get in return?
: If you have suggestions, or wish for a certain perk, don't hesitate to comment!

Other than that, check the perks! Here's what the badges will probably look like, WHICH ONLY YOU ON INDIEGOGO CAN GET IF YOU HELP US :

The ""Grinsch""



might look like this if you were interface guy:




 


: Why all of this? : Simply put: We woke up one morning, simultaneously calling each other(Now imagine three voices overlapping each other):
""Woah! I just had the coolest idea!"".. ""Me too!""..""Ok, what's yours!?""..""No you go first!""..""No you!"" - And then it happened.We all had totally different useless ideas.But some time later this idea was born and we liked it. So we worked on it. And we think you'll like it.




 


: What are the risks? : Not many. It'll be fun! Well, we could catch a major cold and can't work for weeks. That would put a dent in our plan, but with enough funds we'd hire someone to replace the missing work force i guess. But we drink green smoothies and work out ..sometimes.And absolute worst case scenario - release next year. But that's not gonna happen. We already put too much sweat into this. We started working on it more than two years ago but had to postpone it. Now's the time.






: I like you and your idea but I can't give you money. What do?

: Well, we like you too, Q, and what you can do is:

<p>Given the fact that Soccer City was originally<b> created in Spain</b> based on Spanish football terminology, some tricks, move and dribble names may vary from its original in English.  </p>
<p>Since this campaign is meant to both raise funds to release the English version, and increase awareness of its nature we would highly<b> appreciate your suggestions and recommendations regarding the translation</b>. Soccer City, as football itself, is a team work! </p>

SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCES and THANKS!

Soccer City is a football turn-based board game that reproduces every possible action in a real football match.The game is played in turns by running events, represented in different cards that are played during the game. Dribbling, fouls, shots on goal, tactics...Soccer City is a complete football simulator inspired in the early twentieth century, with a retro look and a stunning design by illustrator Jorge Consuegra.  The goal of this IndieGoGo campaign is to raise funds to produce the English version and involve backers in releasing the game in some more countries.  Gameplay Features* For 2 - 4 players.* 45 - 90 minutes time play.* Ages 12 and up. The full game comes with: * The Board, 40 width x 68 length. * The Tokens, (2 teams, 9 players each, in two different colours) (18 Standing man tokens). * The Referee Dice (1) * The Tactical Pads (2)* The Score   * 6 Card Decks, Total 168 cards:  - Offensive Action Cards (27)  - Defensive Action cards (27)  - Shot-on-Goal cards (28)  - Goalkeeper Save cards (26)  - Ball playing cards (48)  - External Factors (12)The game is played in turns, in which attacker plays first and then turn shifts to defender. Each player has a set of cards consisting in Ball cards, Offensive cards and Defensive cards and Shot on goal cards.Attacking turn consists of 4 sequential phases, and players may decide whether to play them or pass to the next: 1 – Ball Passing / Player advancing  2 - Offensive Action (Dribble or Tactical Move)  3 - Shot on goal  4 - Team repositioningOnce Attacking turn is over, Defensive turn begins, which in 2 phases:  1 - Defensive Action (Tackle or Tactical Move)  2 - Team repositioning  
 
The Pitch, represented by a lattice of 21 x 15 hexagons. 

 




 
18 Standing man tokens, numbered in both sides.

 

 
The Ball playing Cards represent just that, balls. These cards are used to move the ball down the field, either as a Pass, or as a Player Advance.
The Balls can be played in the first phase of Attacking turn: Ball Passing / Player advancing phase.
The Balls can be played in the first phase of Attacking turn: Ball Passing / Player advancing phase.  

 
Offensive Action Cards: Dribblings and Tricks to overcome an opponent. A Lean dribble, a Sombrero dribble, etc. each one with an assigned value that will compete against a defensive action.

 
Defensive action Cards: Tackles, Shoulder Charges and other attempts to steal the ball. 

 
Both offensive and defensive action cards also have the possibility to work as Tactical Actions. These are showed in the same card and allow offensive or defensive tactical moves. 
These Actions are played in the second phase, once the payer has decided whether to pass the ball or advance..
Shot-on-goal Cards are used to create a goal chance. Every Shot on goal has its main value and a bonus. You can get that bonus by fulfilling the conditions the card shows,upgrading the shot to a special shot like a Missile, a Superclass shot, etc...

 
 Shot on goal can be executed following the Action phase from the permitted area drawn on the board only.
Goalkeeper save Cards are used randomly by the defender when the attacker decides to shoot on goal. Value shown on Goalkeeper save cards must be equal or above Shot-on-goal card played to save the ball.

 
External factors are outside issues that may affect tthe macth progress such as ""Coach anger"" that strengthens your team or ""Goalkeeper´s bad day"", that weakens your goalie for the coming turns.They happen at random when playing an Action containing the External Factor (EF) mark.

 
Team Repositioning phase
Once the Attacking / Defending phase is over, both players have the possibility toreposition part of their teams, moving some players around the pitch.

               


 
Tactics Pads are used to check the influence of tactical actions.
One side shows the offensive tactics that are played in the Action phase.
The other side shows the defensive tactics, played on the Action phase to stop the tactics from your attacking opponent.

 

 
The dice works as referee decissions, aimed to solve any controversial situation.
The player that committs a foul has the option to roll the Referee Dice. Not rolling the dice means the Referee whistles the foul.
In case the player decides to roll the dice the Referee will whistle what the Dice shows.
The dice is also numbered from 1 to 6, used to solve the result of a non-controlled ball.

 

 

 

 
Given the fact that Soccer City was originally created in Spain based on Spanish football terminology, some tricks, move and dribble names may vary from its original in English.  
Since this campaign is meant to both raise funds to release the English version, and increase awareness of its nature we would highly appreciate your suggestions and recommendations regarding the translation. Soccer City, as football itself, is a team work! 
Download the complete Soccer City RULEBOOK (1.0) here.
We are working to correct all errors and translation confusions in the rulebook. Soon we will post the version 2.0.


 
Soccer City launch fulfils the dream of two friends, now partners, who began this project two years ago in Spain and now, lots of work and efforts invested, intend to widen the idea of an active Football board Game to some other countries. 
In case IndieGoGo campaign turns out successful, first English Edition is planned to be produced in November 2014.

 
Once minimum target is achieved, production will begin (November 2014, hopefully). Production lapse may vary, depending on funds raised, Stretch Goals and number of backers to be rewarded, but estimations are around 1 to 2 months. As soon as first units are produced we will proceed with shipments.

 Some two years ago two close friends, football, board game lovers began creating a rough, hand-made edition of what would later be Soccer City, filling the gap this kind of games had on the board game range. Their experience in the board game field was limited and the idea of seeing this project in the market was not on their views. But their passion for football and the increasing interest from others towards the project pushed forward the release in Spain by mid-2013. Gonzalo & LisandroThe active turn-based game, the wide range of tactics, moves and possible actions make Soccer City the attractive football game where nearly real football thrill can be experienced.The idea of illustrating Soccer City with classic football scenes and fashions was unquestionable from the very beginning, referring the game to football origins and thus honouring the sport that made us living such great moments.We got best professionals and collaborators helping Soccer City to be what is now, without whom we could hardly succeed. We would like to thank them all, particularly Jorge Consuegra, Cartoonist and illustrator.We also want to thank all our families, friends, relatives and game testers who contributed so much to the project initial success with their encouragement and unconditional support. We want to thank Carlos Rodrigo, the English translator. And last but not least thanks to INDIEGOGO for giving us the opportunity to develop this campaign.And, of course, thanks to Football.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------LINKS TO OUR WEBSITES

I'm a huge fan of tabletop RPG's and I'd like to combine that with my other passion, music. My goal is to create a fun and personal game for everyone who has ever dreamed of rock stardom.
Also, I will do my thesis based on the game so this project is vital to me and I'll make sure that the final product is of high quality.

What I Need & What You Get
This project needs YOUR support in order to succeed. So, what can you do?

Fund the project.
Spread the word.
With 2000 EUR, I can dedicate enough of my time to write a high quality product. The project will be cancelled if the funding goal isn't met, so please, show your support!
You can fund the project starting from only 2 EUR. There are some cool limited perks available, check them out.
Perks

Wild Child - 15 EUR

The Impact
There aren't a lot of music themed RPG's out there and I intend to create the best one. Imagine the fun when you're stage-diving or signing your first record deal. And don't forget dating groupies and performing crazy media stunts. It's all about sex, drugs and rock'n loud!

<p><span>FinnWars is a first person multiplayer shooter concentrating on infantry and armoured combat. The game is about asymmetrical warfare between infantry and mechanized armies. What this means is that even though one side has vehicle superiority, the other side has means to fight against the other in balanced gameplay. FinnWars concentrates on the battles fought on the Eastern Front during World War 2. The main focus is in great battles between Finland and Soviet Union that took place in 1939-1944. The game honors all sides of the war and handles this topic in great respect. </span></p>
<br/>We have planned multiple stretch goals after the initial funding is achieved. For example, these would add aircrafts and anti-aircraft guns into the game. All maps are designed in a way that an airfield can be added later into the game and there is enough space for airplanes to maneuver. Battles between Germany and USSR are the biggest fought in military history. Therefore one big stretch goal would be adding Germany as a playable nation.<br/><p></p>

<p><span>We are <a href=""http://iceflake.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iceflake Studios</a>, an independent game studio from Tampere, Finland. Currently we have a team of six experienced and talented developers. Iceflake Studios was founded in 2007 by Lasse Liljedahl and Tapani Valkonen, who are the core members of the original FinnWars modification dev team. Lasse was responsible for making most of the graphics. Now he is the CEO of the company, but likes to get his hands dirty with 3D graphics as often as possible. Tapani was, and still is, the master programmer of everything. As the company’s CTO he makes sure that techwise everything is top notch and works like a dream.</span></p>
<p>Since the early FinnWars days, our studio has developed games for PC, consoles and mobile platforms. In total we have more than ten commercially released game titles and over 20 million players for our games. Before our professional careers we have developed modifications, games and game engines for PC since the 1990’s. <span>FinnWars is developed by the creators of the original modification. It is a long-standing dream to finally recreate it as a standalone game with modern technology.</span></p>We use Unreal Engine 4 to develop the game. This is a modern game engine that allows us to concentrate on making the best possible product, without wasting too much resources on developing the technology itself. Making spectacular open natural environments where infantry can fight against vehicles can be easily achieved with this approach. With this technology it's possible even for a small team like us to produce a high quality game.<br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449230565/kqmofeid6jvlitwkbhwn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Before or after the original FinnWars modification there has not been a game that simulates warfare between two very imbalanced armies in a balanced way. This is the specialty in our game, and it was achieved in the original with innovative game design and a strong knowledge of military history. Today with all the experience we have gathered we are even better at making games, so this is going to be just awesome!</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">FinnWars concentrates on the battles where the other side mainly consists of infantry, while the other side is equipped with heavy artillery and armoured vehicles. This was the case when Finland and Soviet Union clashed together during World War 2. The Red army had superior numbers of infantry, tanks, airplanes and artillery. However, the tactics each side used during the war were very different. More flexible use of Finnish soldiers and centrally coordinated artillery fire in the vast forests and swamplands of Finnish wilderness evened out the odds.</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449230602/bhepwxpblnnqofiv5cpu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span><span>Why do people still play the old game? What makes FinnWars so good? It’s the ingenious game mechanics. </span>The game is designed to direct players towards team play in many ways. For example the most efficient units, like tanks, cannot be operated effectively by only one player. Instead, their effective use requires that there are gunners and a driver inside the tank. Also a balance between different player classes is a crucial part of the gameplay. Not all players have the ability to work as artillery observer or to have more specialized weapons, like for example, a machine gun or a flamethrower. However, each soldier is able to fight against tanks with improvised weaponry like molotov cocktails, panzerfausts or even wooden logs. Medics can give first aid, but they cannot do miracles and cure players back to full health. Pioneers are good at building things and even better at tearing them down. This class is also handy when it comes to defusing mines.</span></p>
<p>Winter is an essential part of level design and game mechanics. Players can hide mines in snow and spot enemies based on the markings they leave behind. Also ice on lakes and rivers may hold infantry and light vehicles, but crack under the weight of heavy battle tanks.  </p>
<p>Water is also an obstacle during summertime. Bridges in the game play a crucial role in directing movement of heavy units. Bridges can be destroyed and repaired, but crossing the river can also be done by other means. Normal soldiers can swim across rivers, but there are also small boats and amphibious vehicles that can cross the rivers hidden from enemy eyes and strike from behind. </p>Game modes concentrate players to work towards common goals and do not encourage solo play. Objective, frontline and push modes make the mission clear for each player, but keep the battlefield open for different tactics. Gameplay is all about combined arms working towards a common goal. <br/>

<p><span>Game maps take their inspiration from the real battlefields where the Finnish and Soviet forces fought during World War 2. The Winter War became known to the whole world when great battles were fought in places like Summa, Raate, Kollaa, Taipale and so on. Winter is in a big role in the game, although, winter maps mostly concentrate on the early days of World War 2.</span></p>
<br/>Most of the big battles between Finland and Soviet Union were fought during summer. As a matter of the fact one of the most intense battles in the whole World War 2 was fought in Karelian Isthmus in June 1944. This was after the Red Army launched a massive counter offensive and broke through all of the Finnish defences. After almost a month of fierce fighting the Soviet advance halted in the beginning of July near the village of Ihantala. This is only one example from a countless number of battles fought during that five year period when these two nations were at war.<br/>

<p><span>Each army in the original game had their own selection of firearms used during World War 2.</span></p>
<p>In FinnWars the use of firearms is made in an authentic manner. Each weapon type has their own special role on a battlefield. In this game, aiming requires discipline and thought, making running and gunning impossible. Accurate shots are only taken through iron sights. Rifle is a standard weapon with high accuracy and a long firing range. Automatic weapons, on the other hand, are rare and their use requires a skillful gameplay.</p>
<p>Weapons against vehicles are the other side of infantry combat and a major game mechanical element in FinnWars. Even one tank can make a difference against infantry and they can’t be destroyed just by throwing grenades at them. However, there are a number of ways that make armoured vehicles vulnerable to infantry. Normal anti-tank guns are rare, but there are more personal weapons to use. AT rifles are a specialty that can be very effective from long range, but makes the user vulnerable to infantry. First of all disabling vehicles is possible - even though it requires heroism - with anti-tank mines or big wooden logs. To finish the job, tanks can be destroyed by molotov cocktails, satchel charges, panzerschrecks or panzerfausts. </p>Concerning heavy weapons there are artillery and mortar units to provide indirect fire support. Artillery observers can spot targets and players in artillery units can move their fire to those targets. Moreover, players with artillery observer ability can call in heavy artillery strikes to make short, but massive aerial damage upon an enemy team.<br/>

<p><span>Vehicles will concentrate mostly on tanks and other land vehicles. Also small water and amphibious vehicles will be included in the game. If the initial funding is reached, one stretch goal after that is to include also aircrafts into the game. This means fighters, bombers and dive bombers.</span></p>
<p>Authentic vehicles in the game are a result of careful consideration and each has a special role on the battlefield. Troop transports can move soldiers quickly around battlefields, but also move light artillery and AT guns to new positions. Light armoured cars and tanks are good against infantry and can move rapidly around the map, however, they are also vulnerable to light AT weaponry. The real firepower comes from medium and heavy battle tanks, which are hard to destroy, but also slower to operate. The slow maneuvering also makes them vulnerable to quickly moving infantry or artillery fire. Anti-tank vehicles are a special class that combines the firepower of heavy tanks and mobility of light vehicles. Finally there are some special units, like for example amphibious tanks, which can surprise the enemy and turn the tide of a battle. </p>One of the unique features is the realistic tank steering unseen in any other game. Both tracks are controlled separately and moving across the battlefield filled with obstacles is an interesting challenge. </div><div>

<p><span>Originally we founded Iceflake Studios to make a standalone sequel to the original FinnWars modification. Therefore, this project has been brewing for almost a decade now. We have gained a lot of experience from developing and publishing games for all possible platforms and gathered an awesome team of talented developers. We know what it takes to make this a dream project of ours to come true.</span></p>
<p>Fans of the old FinnWars are still playing the old modification to this day and we constantly get asked about when are we going to make a sequel. Players are very fond of how the well the game mechanics are executed and how balanced the gameplay is. We know that there is an audience for this game and we want to finally make it true.</p>

<br/>Currently the game is in an early alpha stage. So far we have made some of the graphical assets and programmed the simple gameplay. The basic multiplayer element is already there! Players can run around and shoot each other in the forests, meadows, swamps, alongside rivers and shores of lakes in the wilderness. Simple things like photorealistic natural environment are complex to make. In this game our ambitious goal is to create a lifelike environment and make the battlefields as authentic as possible on that regard as well.</div><div>In general our roadmap is the following. First task is to implement infantry combat as a whole. This means all infantry weapons and classes. Also artillery is part of the infantry warfare. Different game modes and vehicles will follow after that. Maps and graphical assets are created during the whole development and they are added as they come along.</div><div>Playable Beta is scheduled to December 2016 and the final release in December 2017. We have a clear path what it takes to make this game finished. With your help this schedule is possible and we have the resources to concentrate on making this game. </div><div>

</div></div>","Happy holidays! (Campaign update 23.12.2015)
This holiday we decided to celebrate and give a gift for everyone who bought Early Bird edition or higher. If the campaign is succesful, every backer will now receive:
A second digital copy of FinnWars!

Give the other game as a gift for someone, or contribute as a team and get a double pack of games with the price of one.
New Alpha gameplay video (Campaign update 15.12.2015)
In this update we show the first alpha gameplay of FinnWars. The game is a simple 6 player deathmatch introducing the basic multiplayer gunplay of the current early game version. In this game we have two guns. The first one is a Suomi submachine gun and the other the Finnish Mosin-Nagant M28-30 bolt action rifle. 

Everything is work in progress and does not represent any kind of final quality, but should give some idea on how the game plays.




Updated gameplay screenshots (Campaign update 10.12.2015)
Here are couple of screenshots we took while playing the prototype game. They do not represent any kind of final quality and for example the UI graphics are completely temporary. The game is going to look awesome! We are also preparing on releasing a multiplayer gameplay video footage from the game in near future.

We also added a Collector's Edition perk including the second copy of the game in a physical package and an exclusive fabric FinnWars banner. Check it out!





FinnWars is a first person multiplayer shooter concentrating on infantry and armoured combat. The game is about asymmetrical warfare between infantry and mechanized armies. What this means is that even though one side has vehicle superiority, the other side has means to fight against the other in balanced gameplay. FinnWars concentrates on the battles fought on the Eastern Front during World War 2. The main focus is in great battles between Finland and Soviet Union that took place in 1939-1944. The game honors all sides of the war and handles this topic in great respect. 
We have planned multiple stretch goals after the initial funding is achieved. For example, these would add aircrafts and anti-aircraft guns into the game. All maps are designed in a way that an airfield can be added later into the game and there is enough space for airplanes to maneuver. Battles between Germany and USSR are the biggest fought in military history. Therefore one big stretch goal would be adding Germany as a playable nation.

Main Features:


Online multiplayer for at least 64 players
Infantry combat and several playable classes
Tanks, tanks and more tanks
Artillery gameplay
Weapons from small calibers to 203 mm heavy howitzers
Finland and Soviet Union as playable nations
Summer and winter battles
Battlefields inspired by real locations
Beautiful environments
Tactical gameplay


Extra features planned for additional stretch goals:

Aircrafts
Anti-aircraft guns
Germany as playable nation





We are Iceflake Studios, an independent game studio from Tampere, Finland. Currently we have a team of six experienced and talented developers. Iceflake Studios was founded in 2007 by Lasse Liljedahl and Tapani Valkonen, who are the core members of the original FinnWars modification dev team. Lasse was responsible for making most of the graphics. Now he is the CEO of the company, but likes to get his hands dirty with 3D graphics as often as possible. Tapani was, and still is, the master programmer of everything. As the company’s CTO he makes sure that techwise everything is top notch and works like a dream.
Since the early FinnWars days, our studio has developed games for PC, consoles and mobile platforms. In total we have more than ten commercially released game titles and over 20 million players for our games. Before our professional careers we have developed modifications, games and game engines for PC since the 1990’s. FinnWars is developed by the creators of the original modification. It is a long-standing dream to finally recreate it as a standalone game with modern technology.We use Unreal Engine 4 to develop the game. This is a modern game engine that allows us to concentrate on making the best possible product, without wasting too much resources on developing the technology itself. Making spectacular open natural environments where infantry can fight against vehicles can be easily achieved with this approach. With this technology it's possible even for a small team like us to produce a high quality game.


Before or after the original FinnWars modification there has not been a game that simulates warfare between two very imbalanced armies in a balanced way. This is the specialty in our game, and it was achieved in the original with innovative game design and a strong knowledge of military history. Today with all the experience we have gathered we are even better at making games, so this is going to be just awesome!
FinnWars concentrates on the battles where the other side mainly consists of infantry, while the other side is equipped with heavy artillery and armoured vehicles. This was the case when Finland and Soviet Union clashed together during World War 2. The Red army had superior numbers of infantry, tanks, airplanes and artillery. However, the tactics each side used during the war were very different. More flexible use of Finnish soldiers and centrally coordinated artillery fire in the vast forests and swamplands of Finnish wilderness evened out the odds.




Why do people still play the old game? What makes FinnWars so good? It’s the ingenious game mechanics. The game is designed to direct players towards team play in many ways. For example the most efficient units, like tanks, cannot be operated effectively by only one player. Instead, their effective use requires that there are gunners and a driver inside the tank. Also a balance between different player classes is a crucial part of the gameplay. Not all players have the ability to work as artillery observer or to have more specialized weapons, like for example, a machine gun or a flamethrower. However, each soldier is able to fight against tanks with improvised weaponry like molotov cocktails, panzerfausts or even wooden logs. Medics can give first aid, but they cannot do miracles and cure players back to full health. Pioneers are good at building things and even better at tearing them down. This class is also handy when it comes to defusing mines.
Winter is an essential part of level design and game mechanics. Players can hide mines in snow and spot enemies based on the markings they leave behind. Also ice on lakes and rivers may hold infantry and light vehicles, but crack under the weight of heavy battle tanks.  
Water is also an obstacle during summertime. Bridges in the game play a crucial role in directing movement of heavy units. Bridges can be destroyed and repaired, but crossing the river can also be done by other means. Normal soldiers can swim across rivers, but there are also small boats and amphibious vehicles that can cross the rivers hidden from enemy eyes and strike from behind. Game modes concentrate players to work towards common goals and do not encourage solo play. Objective, frontline and push modes make the mission clear for each player, but keep the battlefield open for different tactics. Gameplay is all about combined arms working towards a common goal. 





Game maps take their inspiration from the real battlefields where the Finnish and Soviet forces fought during World War 2. The Winter War became known to the whole world when great battles were fought in places like Summa, Raate, Kollaa, Taipale and so on. Winter is in a big role in the game, although, winter maps mostly concentrate on the early days of World War 2.
Most of the big battles between Finland and Soviet Union were fought during summer. As a matter of the fact one of the most intense battles in the whole World War 2 was fought in Karelian Isthmus in June 1944. This was after the Red Army launched a massive counter offensive and broke through all of the Finnish defences. After almost a month of fierce fighting the Soviet advance halted in the beginning of July near the village of Ihantala. This is only one example from a countless number of battles fought during that five year period when these two nations were at war.





Each army in the original game had their own selection of firearms used during World War 2.
In FinnWars the use of firearms is made in an authentic manner. Each weapon type has their own special role on a battlefield. In this game, aiming requires discipline and thought, making running and gunning impossible. Accurate shots are only taken through iron sights. Rifle is a standard weapon with high accuracy and a long firing range. Automatic weapons, on the other hand, are rare and their use requires a skillful gameplay.
Weapons against vehicles are the other side of infantry combat and a major game mechanical element in FinnWars. Even one tank can make a difference against infantry and they can’t be destroyed just by throwing grenades at them. However, there are a number of ways that make armoured vehicles vulnerable to infantry. Normal anti-tank guns are rare, but there are more personal weapons to use. AT rifles are a specialty that can be very effective from long range, but makes the user vulnerable to infantry. First of all disabling vehicles is possible - even though it requires heroism - with anti-tank mines or big wooden logs. To finish the job, tanks can be destroyed by molotov cocktails, satchel charges, panzerschrecks or panzerfausts. Concerning heavy weapons there are artillery and mortar units to provide indirect fire support. Artillery observers can spot targets and players in artillery units can move their fire to those targets. Moreover, players with artillery observer ability can call in heavy artillery strikes to make short, but massive aerial damage upon an enemy team.







Vehicles will concentrate mostly on tanks and other land vehicles. Also small water and amphibious vehicles will be included in the game. If the initial funding is reached, one stretch goal after that is to include also aircrafts into the game. This means fighters, bombers and dive bombers.
Authentic vehicles in the game are a result of careful consideration and each has a special role on the battlefield. Troop transports can move soldiers quickly around battlefields, but also move light artillery and AT guns to new positions. Light armoured cars and tanks are good against infantry and can move rapidly around the map, however, they are also vulnerable to light AT weaponry. The real firepower comes from medium and heavy battle tanks, which are hard to destroy, but also slower to operate. The slow maneuvering also makes them vulnerable to quickly moving infantry or artillery fire. Anti-tank vehicles are a special class that combines the firepower of heavy tanks and mobility of light vehicles. Finally there are some special units, like for example amphibious tanks, which can surprise the enemy and turn the tide of a battle. One of the unique features is the realistic tank steering unseen in any other game. Both tracks are controlled separately and moving across the battlefield filled with obstacles is an interesting challenge. 




Originally we founded Iceflake Studios to make a standalone sequel to the original FinnWars modification. Therefore, this project has been brewing for almost a decade now. We have gained a lot of experience from developing and publishing games for all possible platforms and gathered an awesome team of talented developers. We know what it takes to make this a dream project of ours to come true.
Fans of the old FinnWars are still playing the old modification to this day and we constantly get asked about when are we going to make a sequel. Players are very fond of how the well the game mechanics are executed and how balanced the gameplay is. We know that there is an audience for this game and we want to finally make it true.



Currently the game is in an early alpha stage. So far we have made some of the graphical assets and programmed the simple gameplay. The basic multiplayer element is already there! Players can run around and shoot each other in the forests, meadows, swamps, alongside rivers and shores of lakes in the wilderness. Simple things like photorealistic natural environment are complex to make. In this game our ambitious goal is to create a lifelike environment and make the battlefields as authentic as possible on that regard as well.In general our roadmap is the following. First task is to implement infantry combat as a whole. This means all infantry weapons and classes. Also artillery is part of the infantry warfare. Different game modes and vehicles will follow after that. Maps and graphical assets are created during the whole development and they are added as they come along.Playable Beta is scheduled to December 2016 and the final release in December 2017. We have a clear path what it takes to make this game finished. With your help this schedule is possible and we have the resources to concentrate on making this game. 





Indiegogo is only part of the game's funding. For every euro you put into the project, we will put in another as a company. We know this is a big project to complete and we do not have delusions on how much it will cost to realize this game. Funding through Indiegogo is a crucial part in getting the complete game financed and it will also tell us about the real demand on a game.


There are no words we can say to express the gratitude we owe to every contributer. Without you this game is not possible. 



The special FinnWars T-shirt is available only during this campaign. The design is similar to shown above. The supplier for the T-shirts has not yet been selected. However, please leave a private comment with your size or send your size by email. Normal sizes S-XXL apply. T-shirts are delivered with other physical items soon after the campaign closes (if successful).



High quality FinnWars mousepad is the second physical item included in some of the perks. Also this mousepad with the design shown above is only available during the campaign. The tank shown in these physical items is a legendary Soviet light tank T-26. It was developed in the early 1930’s and over 50 variants were made from flamethrower tanks to radio controlled prototypes.



In all perks starting from the Collector's Edition you will get a physical copy of the game in a DVD box with custom art. This is in addition to the digital copy of the game, so in total there will be two copies of the game.
An exclusive fabric banner that is suitable for hanging it on your wall is included in all of the perks starting from the Collector's Edition. 
The digital artbook featuring the art of FinnWars. From the pages of this book you find concept art, sketches and 3D art showing how the game developed from the early stages to the final product.Digital download of the FinnWars original soundtrack will include musics from the game.












We will hold a launch party somewhere in Tampere, Finland close to the game’s release. You get to meet the developer team and have a great party with us. One night stay in one of the nice hotels in Tampere near our studio will be covered by us. Travel expenses will not be covered.

<h3>Derelicts: The Chronicles of Column 77 </h3>
<p>Derelicts is a fantasy armoured warfare sim that's been written specifically for play on community message boards. Participation is open-ended: you can play with as few or as many people as you'd like, and players can jump in or out of the experience as they wish without disrupting the game.</p>
<p>The objective of the game is to hunt down, engage and destroy five titantic automatons within the remains of the city of Krakberg. The central theme of the game is exploration.</p>
<p>The finished product will be a full color, 500 page 8.5 x 11"" PDF rulebook (only the person running the game will need the rulebook; players will be able to participate with very minimal rules explanation).</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">    Black is a challenging yet intuitive linear puzzle game. It integrates a cool original soundtrack and an exciting bonus in the form of a digital album ""Black's World"", that you get after you pass the entire game. In this game, you will take control of a small robot named ""Black"". Using only two elements, such as a cube and a ball, you will have to solve numerous puzzles that take place in this surreal environment. A minimalist design allows the player to easily concentrate and just focus on the gameplay. The main character - Black will win your heart with his touching absent-mindedness. Without your help he will not be able to solve various problems that he will encounter along his journey.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>    In its initial stage, the game will be released for all the models of iPad and iPhone, and localized in 8 languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Russian. Later we plan to release the game for all the other mobile platforms.</b><br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">     The concept of the game ""Black"" was coined by a 13-year-old boy named Gabriel Genesis (who eventually became a valued member of our team). Gabriel was tired of ""blowing things up"" and ""being shot at"". He thought that among all the violent games on the market, it would be a great idea to create a more peaceful kind of game. He decided to bring his vision of a logic-based puzzle game to life in the form of our small friend ""Black"". Leading him on a journey through multiple levels of varying difficulty, and on an epic quest for self-improvement, putting him through all types of challenges to prove his worth. A lovably smart but absent-minded little robot was about to be born.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">    So Gabriel is the inspiration behind the project as well as the creator of the main character - the little robot ""Black"".<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>The very first concept art of the game ""Black"" came from young Gabriel. If we compare the above screenshot of the first level of the game with examples of the concept art, you can see how the design has changed. But for our team, this concept art is highly symbolic, and it also serves as a great introduction to the game.</i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Our young game-team loved Gabriel's idea... and we decided to bring it to life!</b><br/></p>

<p>    We spent a lot of time brainstorming before we came to a consensus about the design of the project. We didn’t want the design to look overloaded with graphics and animation, as it moves away from the main idea of the game - solving a puzzle. Also, we didn’t want the game to appear in the vector style with too many sharp colors to irritate the eye or distract a player from the gameplay. As the result of much trial and error, the surreal and minimalist design was born. We are really very proud that our team has managed to create an atmosphere for the game that doesn’t look like another cookie-cutter game, but truly has its own unique character.</p>

<p>    There are only two elements in the game that our hero uses to pass the levels - a cube and a ball. And a brain, of course.. your brain.. lol.. Our small robot is more of a great tool to be operated by your hands, he's not so much of an Einstein himself.. :))</p>
<p>    There are also some ancillary elements to use, in the form of ropes and different moving platforms, swings and buttons. With the help of these tools our hero can make the platforms and other elements move - back and forward or up and down.</p>

<p>    The main reason we came to Indiegogo is quite simple: an important member of our team, the lead programmer, got seriously ill, and couldn’t continue to work on the project. We are a close knit team and were hit very hard by this development, but we believe deeply in this game and are not ready to give up.  We realized we need to raise the funds to hire a great programmer to complete the project. Also, now we think about serious extension of the gaming potential of the project, to make it even more enjoyable for you all!</p>
<p>    In order to complete the work on the game we need about 3 - 4 months. During this time, within a defined budget, we plan to release the game for all versions of the iPad and iPhone. And later we will release a major upgrade for the game, which will include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Multiplayer for two players who will be competing in being the fastest and overcoming a self-generating line/track of different obstacles and puzzles needed to be solved.</b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Built-in level editor that will give players the opportunity to try their hand at creating new levels for the game and to earn real money!</b><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">&gt;&gt;&gt; All upgrades will be free to play! &lt;&lt;&lt;</h4>

<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE PROGECT BUDGET - $20 000</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>(currently made​​: specification, design, logic of the 35 levels, music design, the music album ""Black's World"")</b><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>    If funding of our project will exceed the funds requested, then, depending on the collected amount, we will be able to release the game on other devices such as Android, Mac, PC, and so on.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$25,000 - Android (redesign, partial reprogramming)</b><br/>
</li>
<li><b>$30,000 - Mac, PC (redesign, partial reprogramming)</b></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>    All other remaining funds will be used for the further development and improvement of the project. There is a parallel gaming universe where our main character Black resides when he is not solving logic puzzles, a real world where he lives. And it’s quite another story, which specifically directs the thoughts of our team into the 3D direction!</p>
<p>    If the amount of funds raised will be much greater than the requested budget, then it will let us to begin the development of the 3D game’s version right now, simultaneously with our 2D version!</p>
<p>    The 2D and 3D direction of the game will not be overlapping, since they are two different worlds with different feels and emotions. 2D casual games have their own unique charm that will never lose their relevance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b> All of you who help us on Indiegogo will be kept updated with all of our thoughts and plans about the development of the project ""Black"".</b></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We are a young and small team that is just starting in the gaming/software market. So in order to best minimize financial risks with the launch of a new campaign, we took a number of precautions:</p>
<p>1. The game does not have a supermassive budget, so we are not going to spend a lot of money on an expensive advertising campaign. We are going to use social media platforms - that are very popular, but not that expensive and can garner great results, in addition to “word of mouth”, the benefit of a low sales price, the originality of the project and some cool bonus things. As noted above, not every company, especially a young one can afford to give a great album of music as a special “thank you” for playing the game! But that is exactly what we are taking care about: to give you double the pleasure: the game and the music!</p>
<p>2. The game ""Black"" is not a copycat of any other game on the market. From the beginning to the end we have being trying to keep it original and unique. So the novelty of the project is an additional factor to attract a critical mass of buzz and fans.</p>
<p>3. The game is designed for a large age range.</p>
<p>4. The game does not espouse violence, but only the good :))</p>
<p>5. The main game’s component is logic, particularly useful for the development of the younger generation.</p>
<p>6. The game is not a one-off project, we have plans to develop it in all sorts of ways, with new stories, new adventures and a lot of cool twists and turns. The idea of the game allows us to move in a few different directions and we are full of creativity and enthusiasm for its development.</p>
<p>7. The game has a chance to become a social phenomenon, as each of the players can potentially participate by creating their own levels for the game. It is interesting, not only in terms of creative enjoyment, but also it's a chance to feel like you are a part of the project. Giving you a chance to realize your own creative ideas! As well as a chance to potentially make some money from your development.</p>
<p>8. Causality and simplicity of operating allows players to operate the game without any special gaming skills. Even if you have never played any games before.</p>
<p><b>We want to practice a policy of gratitude and always give people something cool in exchange for their support and belief in us and our products.</b></p>
<p><b>We sincerely want to create an epic and adventurous game-story with an extended shelf-life. We don't want to just disappear after the first successful experience, which has been the case with many companies.</b></p>

It integrates a cool original soundtrack and an exciting bonus in the form of a digital album ""Black's World"", that you get after you pass the entire game. In this game, you will take control of a small robot named ""Black"". Using only two elements, such as a cube and a ball, you will have to solve numerous puzzles that take place in this surreal environment. A minimalist design allows the player to easily concentrate and just focus on the gameplay. The main character - Black will win your heart with his touching absent-mindedness. Without your help he will not be able to solve various problems that he will encounter along his journey.
    In its initial stage, the game will be released for all the models of iPad and iPhone, and localized in 8 languages: English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Russian. Later we plan to release the game for all the other mobile platforms.

Screenshot of the first level of the game ""Black"".




     The concept of the game ""Black"" was coined by a 13-year-old boy named Gabriel Genesis (who eventually became a valued member of our team). Gabriel was tired of ""blowing things up"" and ""being shot at"". He thought that among all the violent games on the market, it would be a great idea to create a more peaceful kind of game. He decided to bring his vision of a logic-based puzzle game to life in the form of our small friend ""Black"". Leading him on a journey through multiple levels of varying difficulty, and on an epic quest for self-improvement, putting him through all types of challenges to prove his worth. A lovably smart but absent-minded little robot was about to be born.
    So Gabriel is the inspiration behind the project as well as the creator of the main character - the little robot ""Black"".
The very first concept art of the game ""Black"" came from young Gabriel. If we compare the above screenshot of the first level of the game with examples of the concept art, you can see how the design has changed. But for our team, this concept art is highly symbolic, and it also serves as a great introduction to the game.



Our young game-team loved Gabriel's idea... and we decided to bring it to life!


    We spent a lot of time brainstorming before we came to a consensus about the design of the project. We didn’t want the design to look overloaded with graphics and animation, as it moves away from the main idea of the game - solving a puzzle. Also, we didn’t want the game to appear in the vector style with too many sharp colors to irritate the eye or distract a player from the gameplay. As the result of much trial and error, the surreal and minimalist design was born. We are really very proud that our team has managed to create an atmosphere for the game that doesn’t look like another cookie-cutter game, but truly has its own unique character.

    There are only two elements in the game that our hero uses to pass the levels - a cube and a ball. And a brain, of course.. your brain.. lol.. Our small robot is more of a great tool to be operated by your hands, he's not so much of an Einstein himself.. :))
    There are also some ancillary elements to use, in the form of ropes and different moving platforms, swings and buttons. With the help of these tools our hero can make the platforms and other elements move - back and forward or up and down.

    The game will initially contain 35 levels of varying difficulty, from simple to complex. Almost all of the challenging levels have a simple solution that will depend on your careful observation.

    The game has a very simple and intuitive operation. It does not require you to memorize any of its functions.
A screenshot from the initial introduction to the game.


    Any and all players around the world who purchase the game and successfully complete all the levels will be presented with the album ""Black's World"" (digital edition) as a special reward!! Most will agree, this is a cool bonus, since the game will cost just $2.99 at all game stores!!!
    The album ""Black's World"" was written by distinctive and mysterious musician, hiding under the nickname Basilisk, specifically for this project, and produced by a talented multi-instrumentalist, emerging NY star, singer&songwriter Maria Brodskaya (aMBe). The music presented here creates an atmosphere of the world where the little robot ""Black"", the hero of our game, lives. The album has nine instrumental tracks, and the ninth track is the soundtrack of the game. The album is presented on iTunes and other popular stores in order to give everyone a chance to listen to a sample of the music tracks, as well as for additional financial aid  for our company. Also, you can listen to some excerpts of the tracks from the album on our official site www.okospace.com.
And now the most important thing for those who are going to support the project!!!
    All the gifts that are offered and available to you here are exclusive and were specially created for the Indiegogo campaign. The only exception is the digital edition of the album ""Black's World"" and the game itself. The copies of these gifts will not be made available after this Indiegogo campaign is over. So this is your one and only chance to get them - NOW!!!

   We really want the arc of our story - “how this young company began its life” - to remain in your memory and in your hands with some cool and unique rewards!!!

All the physical gifts, a digital copy of the game, and gifts related to the release of the game will be delivered in February 2014 or earlier.
All digital gifts will be delivered within the next month after a successful campaign on Indiegogo.

Delivery of the gifts all around the world is included in the the price of gift.




We will do our best to deliver our gifts to you 
as quickly as possible!!!


We also commit ourselves, as a solidarity, to support other interesting projects on Indiegogo!!!



    The main reason we came to Indiegogo is quite simple: an important member of our team, the lead programmer, got seriously ill, and couldn’t continue to work on the project. We are a close knit team and were hit very hard by this development, but we believe deeply in this game and are not ready to give up.  We realized we need to raise the funds to hire a great programmer to complete the project. Also, now we think about serious extension of the gaming potential of the project, to make it even more enjoyable for you all!
    In order to complete the work on the game we need about 3 - 4 months. During this time, within a defined budget, we plan to release the game for all versions of the iPad and iPhone. And later we will release a major upgrade for the game, which will include:



Multiplayer for two players who will be competing in being the fastest and overcoming a self-generating line/track of different obstacles and puzzles needed to be solved.


Built-in level editor that will give players the opportunity to try their hand at creating new levels for the game and to earn real money!



>>> All upgrades will be free to play! <<<



THE PROGECT BUDGET - $20 000
(currently made​​: specification, design, logic of the 35 levels, music design, the music album ""Black's World"")




    If funding of our project will exceed the funds requested, then, depending on the collected amount, we will be able to release the game on other devices such as Android, Mac, PC, and so on.



$25,000 - Android (redesign, partial reprogramming)

$30,000 - Mac, PC (redesign, partial reprogramming)


    All other remaining funds will be used for the further development and improvement of the project. There is a parallel gaming universe where our main character Black resides when he is not solving logic puzzles, a real world where he lives. And it’s quite another story, which specifically directs the thoughts of our team into the 3D direction!
    If the amount of funds raised will be much greater than the requested budget, then it will let us to begin the development of the 3D game’s version right now, simultaneously with our 2D version!
    The 2D and 3D direction of the game will not be overlapping, since they are two different worlds with different feels and emotions. 2D casual games have their own unique charm that will never lose their relevance.
 All of you who help us on Indiegogo will be kept updated with all of our thoughts and plans about the development of the project ""Black"".


    Your participation in this project will pave the path to the world of a little robot called ""Black"". The world that we promise to develop with all our passion! Cause we believe so sincerely and truly that this project deserves to be born into this world and can be both - a big use and fun for anyone.
    This is your chance to bring a new and original project into the world of gaming. The project that we really think and hope conceals a large and diverse future.
Also, thank you for spending your time and strength to read this presentation all the way thru to the end! And for your support with the project ""Black""! See you soon!






Risks and challenges
We are a young and small team that is just starting in the gaming/software market. So in order to best minimize financial risks with the launch of a new campaign, we took a number of precautions:
1. The game does not have a supermassive budget, so we are not going to spend a lot of money on an expensive advertising campaign. We are going to use social media platforms - that are very popular, but not that expensive and can garner great results, in addition to “word of mouth”, the benefit of a low sales price, the originality of the project and some cool bonus things. As noted above, not every company, especially a young one can afford to give a great album of music as a special “thank you” for playing the game! But that is exactly what we are taking care about: to give you double the pleasure: the game and the music!
2. The game ""Black"" is not a copycat of any other game on the market. From the beginning to the end we have being trying to keep it original and unique. So the novelty of the project is an additional factor to attract a critical mass of buzz and fans.
3. The game is designed for a large age range.
4. The game does not espouse violence, but only the good :))
5. The main game’s component is logic, particularly useful for the development of the younger generation.
6. The game is not a one-off project, we have plans to develop it in all sorts of ways, with new stories, new adventures and a lot of cool twists and turns. The idea of the game allows us to move in a few different directions and we are full of creativity and enthusiasm for its development.
7. The game has a chance to become a social phenomenon, as each of the players can potentially participate by creating their own levels for the game. It is interesting, not only in terms of creative enjoyment, but also it's a chance to feel like you are a part of the project. Giving you a chance to realize your own creative ideas! As well as a chance to potentially make some money from your development.
8. Causality and simplicity of operating allows players to operate the game without any special gaming skills. Even if you have never played any games before.
We want to practice a policy of gratitude and always give people something cool in exchange for their support and belief in us and our products.
We sincerely want to create an epic and adventurous game-story with an extended shelf-life. We don't want to just disappear after the first successful experience, which has been the case with many companies.",53.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","We are proud to present ""Animal Duel"", the board game. After 3 private board
games, we created our first public game.
Although we are a
Spanish company, the game will be in Spanish/English languages.
We wanted to
create a duel game between 2 players, and this is the result. In our humble
opinion, these types of games must be tested and retested on and on, in order
to reach a balanced and fun game.
And so is how
""Animal Duel"" born...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Estamos orgullosos de presentar ""Animal Duel"", el juego de mesa. Después de 3 juegos de mesa privados, hemos creado nuestro primer juego público.Aunque somos una compañía española, el juego estará en Español/Inglés.Queríamos crear un juego de duelos entre 2 jugadores, y este es el resultado. En nuestra humilde opinión, este tipo de juegos debe ser testeado una y otra vez, con el fin de alcanzar un juego equilibrado y divertido.Y así es como ""Animal Duel"" nació...The objective of
this game is to destroy the opponent's life by placing cards on the board. A
best of three games.There are two
types of cards:

The situational
cards, which are those that alter the progress of the game.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
El objetivo del juego es destruir la vida del oponentes colocando cartas en el tablero. Al mejor de 3 partidas.
Hay dos tipos de cartas:

Las cartas situacionales, son aquellas que alteran el progreso del juego..

The animal cards,
which are used to damage to the opponent.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Las cartas de animales, que son usadas para dañar al oponente.These animal cards
have 4 filled circles on their 4 sides. Each circle is divided into four
quarters, which are colored according to the strength of the animal. For
example, if you have the right circle with its 4 quarters green coloured, it
means that you have 4 points on the right side. And so with their 4 sides.
Therefore, the animal's strength is defined by their 4 sides.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Estas cartas de animal tienen 4 círculos rellenos en sus 4 lados. Cada círculo esta dividido en 4 cuartos, que están coloreados según la fuerza del animal. Por ejemplo, si tienes el círculo derecho con sus 4 cuartos coloreados en verde, significa que tienes 4 puntos en el lado derecho. Y así con sus 4 lados. Por lo tanto, la fuerza del animal está definida por sus 4 lados.
On each turn,
players play their situational cards and strategically place their animal cards
(with the name of the animal facing them) on the 16 quadrants of the
board.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------En cada turno, los jugadores juegan sus cartas situacionales y estratégicamente colocan sus cartas de animal (con el nombre del animal mirando hacia ellos) en los 16 cuadrantes del tablero.
At the beginning,
players choose side of the board. Now both players roll a 6-sided dice. Whoever wins will be the first player.
The life tokens
(they may be coins) are placed on 21 in the life bar zone. If tokens are coins, the winner could win both of them, making
the game more interesting.
5 cards are dealt.
Players must always have at least 2 animal cards. Otherwise, you must return a
situational card to the deck and draw another card, until 2 animal cards are
obtained.
Turn Player 1:

If desired,
situation cards are used. Apply their effects and discard them in the papyrus
zone.


Mandatorily an
animal card is played on an unoccupied position of the board.


If that played
card has an adjacent enemy card, the highest score on that side will be
subtracted to the lowest score and the result will be the damage dealt to the
player with the lowest score.


That damage will
be subtracted to the life bar of the corresponding player.

The same process
will be repeated if there are still sides of the played card in contact with
enemy cards on the board.
When all damages
have been calculated, the player draws cards from the deck until having 5 cards
again (2 of them must always be animal cards).

Pass the turn to
player 2, and repeat the process to the end of the game. The game ends when a
player reach 0 health points or when board is complete, winning whoever has more
health points.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Al comienzo, los jugadores eligen lado del tablero. Ahora ambos jugadores tiran un dado de 6 caras. El que gane será el primer jugador.
Los contadores de vida (pueden ser monedas) son colocados en el 21 en la zona de la barra de vida. Si los contadores son monedas, el ganador podría ganar ambas, haciendo el juego más interesante.
Se reparten 5 cartas. Los jugadores deben tener siempre al menos 2 cartas de animales. En el caso contrario, se deberá devolver una carta situacional al mazo y robar otra carta, así hasta tener 2 cartas de animal.
Turno del Jugador 1:

Si se quiere, se usarán la o las cartas situacionales. Se aplican sus efectos y se descartan en la zona del papiro.
Obligatoriamente se jugará una carta de animal en una posición desocupada del tablero.
Si esa carta jugada tiene una carta enemiga adyacente, la puntuación más alta de ese lado se restará a la menor y el resultado será el daño hecho al jugador con la menor puntuación.

Ese daño será restado a la barra de vida del jugador correspondiente.
Se repetirá el mismo proceso mientras haya lados de la carta jugada en contacto con cartas enemigas sobre el tablero.
Cuándo todos los daños hayan sido calculados, el jugador roba cartas del mazo hasta volver a tener 5 cartas (2 de ellas siempre deben ser cartas de animal).
Pasa el turno al jugador 2, y se repite el proceso completo hasta acabar el juego. El juego acaba cuándo un jugador llega a 0 puntos de vida o cuando se completa el tablero, ganando quién tenga más puntos de vida.

<h3><strong>Zombie Raiders, an apocalyptic crafting, exploring and fighting game</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.deonn.com/zombieraiders/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Download version 1.0 here!</strong></a></p>
<p>Deonn Games started in 2010 as a small part-time studio with a passion for developing games. Due to the low budget and primary jobs from the team, we aimed at mobile games, as they can be simple and quick to finish and run Java apps in the case of Android. We now have a few completed and marketed games, including our biggest hit Asteroid Defense, Krafteers and Mac Hunter. The latest release although is what brought us here.<br/><img alt=""survivalist"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deonn.com/files/survivalist-small1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/><br/>Zombie Raiders was launched for mobile devices as a building and crafting game but can be much more. You can download and play for free our most recent version for PC, join the multiplayer server and build your own anti-zombie shelter. Even in the present state - 2D top-view graphics, limited player customization and world size, it’s great fun and has a great potential to become a full Action RPG system for Desktop computers (PC, Mac and Linux): A completely constructable/destructible online sandbox world simulating a zombie infestation where you can interact with every single element.<br/><br/>Our small team is formed by one coder, one graphic artist and one sound engineer. We ask for the minimum amount to pay the development costs. It should take around 6 months to finish, making it a monthly cost of around U$ 3.500 for the studio to run (including employees, rent, salary) and totaling $ 21.000. We are rounding this up and asking for $20k.<br/><br/>What you get? Besides helping in the creation of a really awesome PC game, depending on your collaboration you can have other advantages: a much cheaper preorder, exclusive character customization options and items, vehicles, and even have your brand or name printed in-game in an element of your choice (monuments, outdoors, buildings).<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.33609108510427177""><br/><br/><span>Excited about this project? Check out more details below:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><img alt=""Zombies"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deonn.com/files/promo-intro-small.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Zombie Raiders""/></span></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>New Video games</strong> with the ambition of putting the player inside a  world simulating a zombie infection where every dead would return to walk and attack the living are appearing every other day since around 2002 and the return of the genre popularized in the 70’s by George Romero’ movies. When we think it’s getting old, like a rotten corpse rising from underground, another wave of movies, series, comics and games featuring the undead will reappear.</p>
<p><img alt=""zombie raiders"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deonn.com/files/screens-promo-play1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>That never stopped</strong> us</span><span> from creating this concept. This is a project that has been pursued for some years now, even before zombies were cool. Sad thing with small teams is that it takes a lot of time and attempts to achieve something decent.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>What always motivated us</strong><span> was the fact that practically every single one of the millions of zombie themed games were disappointing. It is really easy to disappoint when it comes to zombie games, because they are just stupid ghouls that can’t even shoot a gun. Every aspect of the shoot ‘em zombies were already exploited by at least 3 big budget games. Graphical zombie carnage excellence was achieved by some. Other games had incredible weapon customization for maximum blasting power. But they all lacked something.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><img alt=""zombie raiders"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deonn.com/files/screens-promo-play2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><strong>Surviving a zombie apocalypse</strong> is not just run in a predefined path killing all the zombies you can with giant weapons (although that would be cool). In a more realistic simulation, zombies are mainly obstacles to your already harsh day-to-day survival. When you are lost and hungry, every known person is dead or zombified, you have to find a safe place to settle, gather resources, find companions, build structures, craft utilities, scavenge the perimeter to search for weapons, ammo, food and water.</p>
<p><img alt=""zombie raiders"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deonn.com/files/screens-promo-play3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>But how could we</strong><span><strong> create</strong> such a complex game with so little resources? After many attempts using different engines and languages, we found a way to do it by splitting the project in phases and modular codes that defines behavior and features of each object in the simulation. With that, it’s easy and quick to add new items, mobs, npcs, or balance existing ones. The crafting menus automatically tells the player what are the necessary crafting items to make it easy to know what can you do in-game. Initially it was programmed to be a simple android-only, 2D, locally hosted multiplayer and distributed freely in Google Play (with interstitial ads). It runs ok on medium-end phones and tabs, and great for high-end devices with bigger screens. A brief period of beta testing for free encouraged us to try running a free online server for the game with a bigger world map and unlimited simultaneous players.</span></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""zombie raiders"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deonn.com/files/screens-promo-play4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Without any advertisements</strong> or promotion except an youtube video and usual Google Play visibility, the mobile version of the game had so far more than 3.000 downloads and lots of encouraging messages, suggestions, tips and gameplay ideas, people playing and helping balance the game, forming groups and gangs, in a way that we think we need to expand it all and bring it to the power of PC.</p>
<p><img alt=""zombie raiders"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deonn.com/files/screens-promo-play5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>It is possible to make this game really awesome</strong>. Every in-game item can be combined or splitted into parts, with no limits of iterations. It can have awesome 3D graphics with full HD resolution and immersive atmosphere. Buildings that you can actually go inside or build your own. Destructable terrains. Stores aboveground or underground passages. Different camera angles and views. Ragdoll animations for dead zombies. Character editor, customization, armors, a giant diversity of weapons and other items. Clans or gangs registration, so you can compete with other groups of survivors in PvP servers, private in-game stashes and belongings, a true and complete RPG system for battles and in an expansive realistic world full of cities, villages, all simulating an earth with a severe case of zombie pandemia.</p>
<p><img alt=""zombie raiders"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deonn.com/files/screens-promo-play6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Some similar games</strong> are coming now, finally, after so many years, from big budget game studios. Will they follow many of their predecessors and also disappoint, delivering low levels of interactions or freedom to take whatever decision you want inside the game? Future will tell. But for the present we have a great playable “prototype” urging to be improved, and with your help we can make them have a run for their money by creating a collaborative, community driven ultimate zombie game.</p>
<p><img alt=""zombie raiders"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.deonn.com/files/screens-promo-play7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>You can download</strong><strong> and play</strong> the PC version of Zombie Raiders for free and see what we have already achieved. The whole structure of the game is done and stable, and a graphical upgrade to 3D and addition of more elements is what’s more urgent. But the plans are to go much further. It all depends on how much interest we can attract with our project.</p>

Download version 1.0 here!
Deonn Games started in 2010 as a small part-time studio with a passion for developing games. Due to the low budget and primary jobs from the team, we aimed at mobile games, as they can be simple and quick to finish and run Java apps in the case of Android. We now have a few completed and marketed games, including our biggest hit Asteroid Defense, Krafteers and Mac Hunter. The latest release although is what brought us here.Zombie Raiders was launched for mobile devices as a building and crafting game but can be much more. You can download and play for free our most recent version for PC, join the multiplayer server and build your own anti-zombie shelter. Even in the present state - 2D top-view graphics, limited player customization and world size, it’s great fun and has a great potential to become a full Action RPG system for Desktop computers (PC, Mac and Linux): A completely constructable/destructible online sandbox world simulating a zombie infestation where you can interact with every single element.Our small team is formed by one coder, one graphic artist and one sound engineer. We ask for the minimum amount to pay the development costs. It should take around 6 months to finish, making it a monthly cost of around U$ 3.500 for the studio to run (including employees, rent, salary) and totaling $ 21.000. We are rounding this up and asking for $20k.What you get? Besides helping in the creation of a really awesome PC game, depending on your collaboration you can have other advantages: a much cheaper preorder, exclusive character customization options and items, vehicles, and even have your brand or name printed in-game in an element of your choice (monuments, outdoors, buildings).Excited about this project? Check out more details below:

New Video games with the ambition of putting the player inside a  world simulating a zombie infection where every dead would return to walk and attack the living are appearing every other day since around 2002 and the return of the genre popularized in the 70’s by George Romero’ movies. When we think it’s getting old, like a rotten corpse rising from underground, another wave of movies, series, comics and games featuring the undead will reappear.

That never stopped us from creating this concept. This is a project that has been pursued for some years now, even before zombies were cool. Sad thing with small teams is that it takes a lot of time and attempts to achieve something decent.
What always motivated us was the fact that practically every single one of the millions of zombie themed games were disappointing. It is really easy to disappoint when it comes to zombie games, because they are just stupid ghouls that can’t even shoot a gun. Every aspect of the shoot ‘em zombies were already exploited by at least 3 big budget games. Graphical zombie carnage excellence was achieved by some. Other games had incredible weapon customization for maximum blasting power. But they all lacked something.

Surviving a zombie apocalypse is not just run in a predefined path killing all the zombies you can with giant weapons (although that would be cool). In a more realistic simulation, zombies are mainly obstacles to your already harsh day-to-day survival. When you are lost and hungry, every known person is dead or zombified, you have to find a safe place to settle, gather resources, find companions, build structures, craft utilities, scavenge the perimeter to search for weapons, ammo, food and water.

But how could we create such a complex game with so little resources? After many attempts using different engines and languages, we found a way to do it by splitting the project in phases and modular codes that defines behavior and features of each object in the simulation. With that, it’s easy and quick to add new items, mobs, npcs, or balance existing ones. The crafting menus automatically tells the player what are the necessary crafting items to make it easy to know what can you do in-game. Initially it was programmed to be a simple android-only, 2D, locally hosted multiplayer and distributed freely in Google Play (with interstitial ads). It runs ok on medium-end phones and tabs, and great for high-end devices with bigger screens. A brief period of beta testing for free encouraged us to try running a free online server for the game with a bigger world map and unlimited simultaneous players.

Without any advertisements or promotion except an youtube video and usual Google Play visibility, the mobile version of the game had so far more than 3.000 downloads and lots of encouraging messages, suggestions, tips and gameplay ideas, people playing and helping balance the game, forming groups and gangs, in a way that we think we need to expand it all and bring it to the power of PC.

It is possible to make this game really awesome. Every in-game item can be combined or splitted into parts, with no limits of iterations. It can have awesome 3D graphics with full HD resolution and immersive atmosphere. Buildings that you can actually go inside or build your own. Destructable terrains. Stores aboveground or underground passages. Different camera angles and views. Ragdoll animations for dead zombies. Character editor, customization, armors, a giant diversity of weapons and other items. Clans or gangs registration, so you can compete with other groups of survivors in PvP servers, private in-game stashes and belongings, a true and complete RPG system for battles and in an expansive realistic world full of cities, villages, all simulating an earth with a severe case of zombie pandemia.

Some similar games are coming now, finally, after so many years, from big budget game studios. Will they follow many of their predecessors and also disappoint, delivering low levels of interactions or freedom to take whatever decision you want inside the game? Future will tell. But for the present we have a great playable “prototype” urging to be improved, and with your help we can make them have a run for their money by creating a collaborative, community driven ultimate zombie game.

You can download and play the PC version of Zombie Raiders for free and see what we have already achieved. The whole structure of the game is done and stable, and a graphical upgrade to 3D and addition of more elements is what’s more urgent. But the plans are to go much further. It all depends on how much interest we can attract with our project.
We already have:

Lots of items to scavenge and craft
Build walls and utilities to fortify your shelter
Hire companions, trade, buy and sell items
Conquer Outposts through the map
Explode bombs, landmines and barrels
Play online with your friends using a LAN network Online Multiplayer also available in our server
HD Graphics when supported, low graphics mode was implemented to make the game compatible to all the devices.

In your shelter, supplies were scarce. When you found a helicopter, decided to take off in search of survival and valuable items.

<h2>Development version gameplay footage (Feb. 27)</h2>
<p>So I asked one of my favorite YouTube Let’s Players (and fellow game developer) <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/JimPlaysGames"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JimPlaysGames</a> to help me test the development version of the game. He was kind enough to help me out and also recorded the session. He experienced some weird stutters that I can’t quite explain. Nevertheless, you can watch the entire gaming session (6 players, 45min) here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2TUioMZfL0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2TUioMZfL0</a>.</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Michael Goldener (though I tend to go with the name Fritz) and I like to use computers to create things. One of my longest running projects is a unique free, experimental FPS game called ""Revenge Of The Cats: Ethernet"" (<a href=""http://www.desura.com/games/revenge-of-the-cats-ethernet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.desura.com/games/revenge-of-the-cats-ethernet</a>).</p>
<p>I was born in 1985 and despite having acquired a lot of computer-related skills since then, I've never been able to use them to make money*. But who cares? - I do this because it's interesting, fun and inherently rewarding. If I need money, there are always ""real"" Jobs I can do on the side. At least that's what I used to think. But the last few years have proven that (1) I'm terrible at getting ""real"" jobs and that (2) working a ""real"" job leaves me with no energy to work on the things I actually care about.</p>
<p>* One exception: Someone once donated 10$ to ROTC: Ethernet. I used the money to buy Hotline Miami :-)</p>
<p><strong>Crowdfunding: The solution?</strong></p>
<p>Could crowdfunding be a way for me to work on projects I care about while also getting some money to pay the bills?</p>
<p>That's what I'm trying to figure out here. And with this being my first attempt at crowdfunding, I'm starting with an inexpensive and short (but also very intense) project: Creating a small but fun PC game in just two weeks. </p>
<p>I'll need to raise 700 bucks to cover the cost of the project, which is essentially just my living expenses for the two weeks I'm currently dedicating to nothing else than working on the game.</p>
<h2>Why you might help</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maybe you want your own, visually unique etherform in the game (see ""Unique Etherform"" perk).</li>
<li>Maybe you think the game will be fun and would like a chance to influence its development (see ""Tester"" perk).</li>
<li>Maybe you'd like to have your name, your website or your company prominently displayed in the main menu (see ""Sponsor"" perk).</li>
<li>Maybe you have a short message that you'd like to see in the game (see ""Supporter With A Message"" perk).</li>
<li>Maybe you want to help me out because you like <a href=""http://www.desura.com/games/revenge-of-the-cats-ethernet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ROTC: Ethernet</a>.</li>
<li>Or maybe you think like me and believe that projects like this somehow deserve support on principle ;-)</li>

<h2>How similar is Cat5 to ROTC: Ethernet?</h2>
<p>Technically, Cat5 is a fork of ROTC: Ethernet. But the only thing thing the finished version of Cat5 will share with ROTC is code and the basic idea of the ""Ethernet"" game mode. Cat5's gameplay is very different from ROTC's.</p>
<h2>About the game</h2>
<p>Cat5 is a multiplayer top-down team-based tactical action game for Windows, Linux and (hopefully) MacOS X. </p>
<p><strong>Think <strong>ROTC: Ethernet meets </strong>Frozen Synapse meets Hotline Miami!</strong></p>
<h3>The ""Ethernet"" game type (à la <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1UhaADbWuY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m21s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""ROTC: Ethernet"">ROTC: Ethernet</a>)</h3>
<p><a href=""http://cat5.wasted.ch/indiegogo/ethernet.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cat5.wasted.ch/indiegogo/ethernet_thumb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>Maps are divided into zones and two teams fight over control of these zones. Players control flying, indestructible ""etherforms"" that can manifest into physical form within a zone controlled by their team. These physical forms can then capture additional zones by being inside them while no physical enemy  is also present. The zone then turns the team's color. If physical forms of both teams are present, the zone remains white. The game is won if the opposing team has lost all their zones and has no more physical forms on the map that could possibly claim them back. </p>
<p>Physical forms can voluntarily switch back into etherform at any time. If they are destroyed, their player is simply forced back into etherform.</p>
<h3>Tight role-based teamplay (à la <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXbsSLeINhg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Frozen Synapse"">Frozen Synapse</a>)</h3>
<p><a href=""http://cat5.wasted.ch/indiegogo/teamwork.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cat5.wasted.ch/indiegogo/teamwork_thumb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a><br/>Players will have to work tightly together in order to capture zones. Going in alone will only get you killed.</p>
<p><strong>The following classes are currently planned:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shotgunner: The primary assault class, shotgunners move fast and can destroy physical forms with one hit at close range. Their main weakness is their low rate of fire.</li>
<li>Minigunner: Minigunners can provide supressing fire allowing teammates to move to new positions.</li>
<li>Specialist: Their bouncing projectiles can be used to attack enemies behind cover.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unforgiving fast-paced high-precision combat (à la <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8SRUYjMzGI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Hotline Miami"">Hotline Miami</a>)</h3>
<p><a href=""http://cat5.wasted.ch/indiegogo/combat.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cat5.wasted.ch/indiegogo/combat_thumb.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></a>The combination of precise mouse/keyboard controls and the top-down viewpoint allows for intense combat, where the smallest mistake can lead to a quick death. Though saying ""death"" is misleading, as players can't really die. Destroying a player's physical form only forces him back into etherform, enabling him to manifest somewhere else soon after.</p>

<p>If funding succeeds, I'll release the game (client &amp; server) as freeware to the public through <a href=""http://cat5.wasted.ch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://cat5.wasted.ch</a> no later than the first of march 2013.</p>

Marijuana smokers, who enjoy smoking while playing board games.  All players are encouraged to contribute weed
to the “Community Dish” at the start of the game.  Other recommended supplies include drinks,
snacks, and a variety of smoking devices, and most importantly a bong!</span><br/></p><p>
</p><p>How to play. 
Roll-A-Bong is a track board game where players roll dice to move.  Two six sided dice are needed to play.  Players roll both dice to determine order of
play, the highest going first!  A single
die is rolled to move an individual’s token down the track.  Each square has directions to be followed by
the player.  If the player is unable to
complete the task or does not want the result (example “Take a Bong”) the
player may give away the prize to any other player or spectator.  </p>
<p>Most importantly, no one wins, and there is no need to
finish any game.  It is designed for
smoking fun and should be used by choice. 
In this bold new future we are all brothers and sisters in this
legalization of our favorite hobby!</p>

Community service!</p>
<p><b>Instant
Improvisation</b>- Do a stupid human trick, an impersonation of a famous
person, or tell a joke.</p>
<p><b>Worm Hole</b>-
Player rerolls die to see if they jump to next or move back to the last worm
Hole.  1-3 back, 4-6 forward.  If there is no back or forward Worm Hole, the
turn is forfeited.  </p>
<p><b>Mr. Narc</b>- You
lose your next bong, sorry (Things are changing!)</p>
<p><b>Corner Deli</b>- Have
a snack!</p>
<p><b>No Papers!</b> -
Immediately roll two dice, you need doubles to leave! (And move that number!)</p>
<p><b>Smoke a Bowl</b>-
Stop, pack one, and smoke and enjoy as a group.</p>
<p><b>Dry Spell</b>-
While players are on these squares, they cannot drink anything!</p>
<p><b>Change Tunes</b>- The
Music selection playing should be changed. 
If no music is playing you’re crazy, put some on!</p>
<p><b>Make a Toast</b>-
All players and spectators toast and drink together.</p>
<p><b>Air Guitar</b>-
Start playing air guitar like your favorite Rock-n-roller.  If you can’t think of anything at least do
“Smoke on the Water.”</p>
<p><b>Take a “Groupie”
like a Selfie but with the whole group</b>- Take a group shot for the “Roll-A-Bong”
Wall of Legalization!</p>
<p><b>Gunga Dinn</b>-
Get all participants a drink.</p>
<p><b>Community Dish</b>-
Add to Community Dish.</p>
<p><b>Energy Shot</b>-After
all that smoking, an Energy shot could help. 
Take what’s available or have a “5 Hour Energy.”  Coffee, Strong tea, even soda with its
dreaded high fructose corn syrup will work.</p>
<p><b>Roll a Joint</b>-
This is the final square, and if there is anything left in the community dish,
all there should share in smoking this joint dedicated to peace and friendship.</p>
<p>The Game board is the same size as an open Double Album
(The same type of album used for cleaning pot in the old days!) and folds in
half for easy storage.  The background of
the board is space themed with pictures of cool space objects and psychedelic
gas cloud formations. The squares make a winding track, similar to the type
used in “Chutes and Ladders.”  Many
squares are repeated, like “Roll-A-Bong” and some only occur once like “Roll a

Marijuana smokers, who enjoy smoking while playing board games.  All players are encouraged to contribute weed
to the “Community Dish” at the start of the game.  Other recommended supplies include drinks,
snacks, and a variety of smoking devices, and most importantly a bong!
How to play. 
Roll-A-Bong is a track board game where players roll dice to move.  Two six sided dice are needed to play.  Players roll both dice to determine order of
play, the highest going first!  A single
die is rolled to move an individual’s token down the track.  Each square has directions to be followed by
the player.  If the player is unable to
complete the task or does not want the result (example “Take a Bong”) the
player may give away the prize to any other player or spectator.  
Most importantly, no one wins, and there is no need to
finish any game.  It is designed for
smoking fun and should be used by choice. 
In this bold new future we are all brothers and sisters in this
legalization of our favorite hobby!

Community service!
Instant
Improvisation- Do a stupid human trick, an impersonation of a famous
person, or tell a joke.
Worm Hole-
Player rerolls die to see if they jump to next or move back to the last worm
Hole.  1-3 back, 4-6 forward.  If there is no back or forward Worm Hole, the
turn is forfeited.  
Mr. Narc- You

a snack!

Immediately roll two dice, you need doubles to leave! (And move that number!)
Smoke a Bowl-
Stop, pack one, and smoke and enjoy as a group.
Dry Spell-

Music selection playing should be changed. 
If no music is playing you’re crazy, put some on!
Make a Toast-
All players and spectators toast and drink together.
Air Guitar-
Start playing air guitar like your favorite Rock-n-roller.  If you can’t think of anything at least do
“Smoke on the Water.”

Wall of Legalization!
Gunga Dinn-
Get all participants a drink.
Community Dish-
Add to Community Dish.
Energy Shot-After
all that smoking, an Energy shot could help. 
Take what’s available or have a “5 Hour Energy.”  Coffee, Strong tea, even soda with its
dreaded high fructose corn syrup will work.
Roll a Joint-
This is the final square, and if there is anything left in the community dish,
all there should share in smoking this joint dedicated to peace and friendship.
The Game board is the same size as an open Double Album
(The same type of album used for cleaning pot in the old days!) and folds in
half for easy storage.  The background of
the board is space themed with pictures of cool space objects and psychedelic
gas cloud formations. The squares make a winding track, similar to the type
used in “Chutes and Ladders.”  Many
squares are repeated, like “Roll-A-Bong” and some only occur once like “Roll a
Joint.”
Players have a choice of the Token they use for playing
pieces, but additional tokens are available for purchase.  The game comes with 2 six sided dice, a game

Each card has three values: RANK, which determines who goes in the circle first, STROKES, which determines how many strokes you need to ejaculate and PRODUCTION, which determines how much cum you produce with each ejaculation. The remaining cards are stroke and bonus cards. Six cards from the deck are dealt to each player, and the rest form the ‘draw’ pile. </p><p>The player with the lowest rank starts in the middle of the circle, and everyone tries to cum on them to get them out of the game. A player is ‘out’ as soon as they acquire fifteen pieces of cum. The player inside the circle is also trying to cum on someone outside the circle, in order to get out of the middle and put an end to the milky shower.</p><p>Every player must always have six cards in their hand. On their turn, a player must play one stroke card and, if they choose, one bonus card. In order to cum, they must reach the ‘strokes’ number on their genital. As they can only play one card per turn, they may require multiple turns to reach the exact number. Alternatively, they can play a higher stroke card and ‘overstimulate’. This means that they have made their genital prohibitively sensitive and must skip a turn after they cum. At the end of their turn, they draw from the pile in order to restore their hand to six cards.</p><p>Once the player in the center has managed to ‘cum’ out, someone else must take their place in the middle. This is the player with the lowest rank less the number of cum chips they’ve acquired. For example, Thor’s Hammer has a rank of 10.  If Thor had collected nine pieces of cum, however, his or her rank would be reduced to a measly 1. Some cards have a rank of * [star] which means they are protected and can never start in the center. However, once they have been cum upon, their total is 0 less the amount of cum chips, which means they can easily end up in the middle. Note: any player departing the circle post-orgasm cannot immediately return, even if they have the lowest rank.</p><p>When only two players remain, a jerk-off commences. To win, they must achieve the perfect orgasm: they cannot overstimulate. Any bonus cards, such as the ‘instant orgasm’, can be used, and the first player to ejaculate wins the game.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/349271/files/20140204145541-d49a48fb5d992e93fa1683938fac1c3a_large.jpg?1391554541"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>How Bonus Cards Work</b></p><p></p><p><i>Instant Orgasm Cards</i> are played in place of a Stroke Card and allow any player to cum immediately.</p><p></p><p><i>Condom Cards</i> can be placed on any player to stop their next orgasm.

<p>

<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sightlinegame.com/data/headerigg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p>Enter a world where the reality itself is deteriorating. A mysterious infection is spreading through the Solar System, breaking down the laws of physics and taking away the consistency of world around them.</p>
<p>Humanity has abandoned Earth and built HeLiOs, an enormous station submerged under the surface of the Sun. A temporary refuge where they urgently try to find the secrets behind the reality splinters. You must make sense of the volatile world you have been thrown in, as things can change by simply looking away, and survive long enough to unveil its mystery and save humanity.</p>
<p>SightLine is a sci-fi story driven, environmental action puzzle game, based on our award winning prototype from the 2013 Indiecade VR Jam. With unique core gameplay mechanics designed to craft a surreal and unique experience, Sightline will be far from reality you are familiar with.</p>
<h1>How do you play?</h1>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sightlinegame.com/gifs/DoorShort.gif"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; width: 230px; height: 130px; float: right;""/><p>SightLine is a game you play by looking. The moment an object leaves your line of sight it can change into something else. The whole scene around you can completely transform by simply turning around. To survive in such world, you need to be looking at the right place in the right time or averting your eyes when the situation calls for it.</p>
<p>You will be able to utilize a variety of tools to help you cope with this world, from simple things such as a flashlight, hand mirror or binoculars, to more complex items such as 3D holographic cameras or light spectrum filters. No moment in SightLine will be the same, and you'll have to constantly figure out what's going on.</p>
<h1>What’s the storyline?</h1>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sightlinegame.com/gifs/TurnAroundShort.gif"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px; width: 230px; height: 130px; float: left;""/><p>While the narration of surreal segments is poetic and philosophical, the storyline unveiling aboard the HeLiOs is rooted in solid reality and proper reasoning. A striking contrast between fuzzy poetry and hard sci-fi, yet more connected than you might think.</p>
<p>The volatile nature of the world of SightLine allows for unique style of storytelling, covering broad spectre of topics, themes and environments, throwing you into deadly situations only to make them vanish like there was never even a sign of threat. </p>
<p>SightLine strives to keep you guessing what’s going on right until the end, not knowing what’s real. Is there some reality behind the dream-like worlds? Are there just illusions on the star station? Support the game and you will know! </p>
<h1>How it started?</h1>
<p>SightLine started as a prototype developed for a 3 week VR jam held by Oculus Rift and IndieCade by Tomáš Mariančík - a hobbyist developer - with the help of Ondřej Pultar and Julian Ceipek, who provided music and narration respectively.
</p>
<p>Thanks to the very positive feedback from the Oculus &amp; IndieCade judges, but also other developers and players, SightLine is now on a track to become a fully fledged game. By supporting the development you not only help us bring a polished unique experience to you, but also turning passionate hobby into a full time work.</p>
<h2>Download and play the prototype yourself!</h2>

<h1>What’s planned for the full version?</h1>
<p>The prototype tests only the basic concept on a few ideas and scenes. We plan to vastly expand the game mechanics and storyline, so there's a lot you can look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Full Sci-Fi Story:</strong> Onboard the star station HeLiOs, the mystery behind the seemingly nonsensical behavior of the world and broken laws of physics will be revealed and explained in a rational way with many references to real science.</li>
<li>
<strong>New Expanded Game Mechanics:</strong> We're building many more puzzles around the concept of lacking object permanence and plan to utilize specific angles of your gaze as well.</li>
<li>
<strong>New Tool System:</strong> To get through SightLine and its environments, you will have to use a variety of tools (hand mirrors, flashlights, even a simple cardboard box to hide things in!) to progress.</li>
<li>
<strong>Better Visuals:</strong> The graphics in the prototype were patched quickly from combination of self-made models and free assets. Thanks to your funding we can bring aboard skilled graphic designers to give SightLine its own unique visuals to please your eyes.</li>
<li>
<strong>High Quality Audio:</strong> The prototype suffers from lower quality audio due to time restrictions of the VR jam. With the funding voice actors will be paid and higher quality audio equipment used. The full version will also continue to feature interactive music that changes as you play through the game to give you the feel of whole orchestra following your actions!</li>
<li>
<strong>Action Scenes:</strong> SightLine won't feature only bizarre puzzles. You'll have to defend yourself and neutralize variety of enemies. By using similarly bizarre methods of course :)</li>
</ul><h2>Supported platforms</h2>
<p>The full version of the game will support at least following platforms out of the box:</p>
<center>
Windows, Mac OS X and Linux (x86/64)<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://data.solirax.org/common/icons/windows_48.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://data.solirax.org/common/icons/mac_48.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://data.solirax.org/common/icons/linux_48.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</center>
<p>Support for other platforms might be added as well thanks to multi-platform magic of the Unity, however cannot be guaranteed at this point.</p>
<h2>Supported devices</h2>
<p>SightLine is developed primarily as a VR experience, but <strong>it will be playable on on regular screen as well</strong> (with certain head controls ""emulated"" through keyboard and mouse). Using Oculus Rift however is recommended for maximum immersion, but if you don't have one, you can still play the game as you would any other.</p>

<p>SightLine is a <strong>3rd place winner in the three week <a href=""http://www.oculusvr.com/vrjam/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VR jam</a> held by Oculus and IndieCade!</strong> Here's what the judges had to say</p>
<blockquote><em>Sight Line was a contender due to the interesting way gaze direction is used as a game-play mechanic. Beyond just changing the world depending on where you look for dramatic effect, the game actually uses player gaze as a game-play element to solve puzzles and interact with the world. Coupled with an interesting metaphysical theme, Sight Line stood out amongst other VR Jam entries.</em></blockquote>

<h1>What are the funds needed for?</h1>
<p>Developing a polished game requires a lot of passion and time. And while we have more than enough of the first, the second is much more scarce resource. By pledging you enable us to work on title full time and set the ball rolling on the development of SightLine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphic Artists</li>
<li>Voice Actors</li>
<li>Licensing costs for other assets and tools used to build the game</li>
<li>Living costs</li>
<li>Fulfilling the perks</li>
</ul><h1>Main Goal</h1>
<p>Our main task it to bring you an unique game filled with as many different experiences as we can, while telling a story that's combination of hard sci-fi and dream-like surrealism. The campaign provides us with basic funds to complete the basic game.</p>
<p>However our plan is to get the development rolling and aquire more funds along the way, to bring you even better and more richer experience, by building a fanbase for this game. We're people who work on this out of passion, which is why we need your help.</p>
<h1>Stretch Goals</h1>
<p>Do you want to see more goodies in SightLine? Then share as if your life depended on it and help us meet our stretch goals! :)</p>
<h3>$17000 - Extra content in the HeLiOs terminals</h3>
<p>Open any terminal on board of HeLiOs and browse large quantities of extra content! Fancy a future version of Wikipedia with details about life in a star station, technology and other details? Want to read blogs, tweets of the people living there? Or maybe read a reviews of products that won't be on the market at least for hundred years!</p>
<h3>$20000 - Suggest and vote for your own mechanics</h3>
<p>We will open up polls for you to submit objects that you'd like to see incorporated into SightLine, then let you vote to pick one that will be implemented! No matter how bizarre, we'll find a way to add it into the SightLine universe!</p>

<h1>How can you help?</h1>
<p>There are several ways you can help make this project reality. Even if you don't have money, you call tell about it to your friends and spread the word.</p>
<h2>Pledge</h2>
<p>Financial support will help us significantly to get the project going and find more talented people to help us build a high quality experience. And you of course get digital download of the game! If you can spare a little bit more money, you can pick a higher pledge and get a special reward in addition to the game itself. Check out the rewards on the right!</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sightlinegame.com/data/TShirtFront.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sightlinegame.com/data/TShirtBack.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><center><a href=""https://teelaunch.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d33304ifi1rp4s.cloudfront.net/badges/indiegogo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></center>
<p><em>Note: The T-Shirt designs are preliminary. If there's enough pledges for shirts you'll be able to select from multiple designs!</em></p>
<p>If you're feeling especially generous, you can even appear in the game itself in some way as a reward! We offer small and large in game appearances. Small appearance can be anything, like a personal object, picture, sound or some model you made that will be placed as a decoration either somewhere on the star station HeLiOs or within the volatile dream-like segments. It can be also reference to a project of your own!</p>
<p>The large appearance gets you more vivid presence: for example as voiced NPC on the Sun station HeLiOs, interactive display or even a whole room or astand: Have your own shop, news stand, ""street"" art performance or become crazy prophet on board of the HeLiOs!</p>
<p>Your options aren't restricted to the examples provided, but in case you consider this pledge, we recommend asking first to make sure it'll be accepted or if any modifications will be done.</p>
<h2>Alpha/Beta testing and feedback</h2>
<p>To ensure high quality of the end product, alpha and beta testers are needed to catch all the pesky bugs and also provide feedback on playability, difficulty of challenges and places where players might get stuck. You'll also be able to make videos of the progress of all the new stuff before everyone else and generate some buzz!</p>
<p>If you want to help us out, grab the alpha access perk to get access to frequent development builds (any higher perk also grants you alpha access). And there's something in it for you as well: <strong>Your name will be in the credits of the game as a thanks for your exceptional support!</strong></p>
<p>Of course if you don’t like spoilers and prefer to play the whole game in one go you should probably wait for the full version.</p>
<h2>Share</h2>
<p>The more people know about the game and campaign the better, so share with everyone you know and even with people you don’t know! <strong>Like the game on Facebook, share it on Reddit, YouTube, Twitter and all the other places.</strong> Even if you can’t actually pledge, you can still help immensely by bringing in people who can.</p>
<h2>Join the team!</h2>
<p>We are looking for people who could lend their skills and abilities to make this project happen. If you think you can join the development (or if you know someone who might be interested), write us an email or private message. Specifically we are looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Graphic designers</strong> (3D modeling of all kinds)</li>
<li>
<strong>Voice actors</strong>
<ul>
<li>Scientists (can be male or female, specific voice doesn’t matter, but you should be able to “sound smart” and handle some technobabble lines)</li>
<li>Various supporting roles for a few lines (different voices, male and female)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>PR</strong> (if you have experience with marketing games and spreading the word about them, you might be of help)</li>
</ul><h3>Questions and feedback welcome!</h3>
<p>If anything is unclear or you have any questions, feel free to contact us or post a comment. Any kinds of feedback is also most welcome!</p></div>","This is a story of how are the laws of physics broken

Don't have an Oculus Rift? Don't worry, this game works on regular screen as well!

Enter a world where the reality itself is deteriorating. A mysterious infection is spreading through the Solar System, breaking down the laws of physics and taking away the consistency of world around them.
Humanity has abandoned Earth and built HeLiOs, an enormous station submerged under the surface of the Sun. A temporary refuge where they urgently try to find the secrets behind the reality splinters. You must make sense of the volatile world you have been thrown in, as things can change by simply looking away, and survive long enough to unveil its mystery and save humanity.

How do you play?
SightLine is a game you play by looking. The moment an object leaves your line of sight it can change into something else. The whole scene around you can completely transform by simply turning around. To survive in such world, you need to be looking at the right place in the right time or averting your eyes when the situation calls for it.

No moment in SightLine will be the same, and you'll have to constantly figure out what's going on.
What’s the storyline?
While the narration of surreal segments is poetic and philosophical, the storyline unveiling aboard the HeLiOs is rooted in solid reality and proper reasoning. A striking contrast between fuzzy poetry and hard sci-fi, yet more connected than you might think.
The volatile nature of the world of SightLine allows for unique style of storytelling, covering broad spectre of topics, themes and environments, throwing you into deadly situations only to make them vanish like there was never even a sign of threat.

Your options aren't restricted to the examples provided, but in case you consider this pledge, we recommend asking first to make sure it'll be accepted or if any modifications will be done.
Alpha/Beta testing and feedback
To ensure high quality of the end product, alpha and beta testers are needed to catch all the pesky bugs and also provide feedback on playability, difficulty of challenges and places where players might get stuck. You'll also be able to make videos of the progress of all the new stuff before everyone else and generate some buzz!
If you want to help us out, grab the alpha access perk to get access to frequent development builds (any higher perk also grants you alpha access). And there's something in it for you as well: Your name will be in the credits of the game as a thanks for your exceptional support!
Of course if you don’t like spoilers and prefer to play the whole game in one go you should probably wait for the full version.
Share
The more people know about the game and campaign the better, so share with everyone you know and even with people you don’t know! Like the game on Facebook, share it on Reddit, YouTube, Twitter and all the other places. Even if you can’t actually pledge, you can still help immensely by bringing in people who can.
Join the team!
We are looking for people who could lend their skills and abilities to make this project happen. If you think you can join the development (or if you know someone who might be interested), write us an email or private message. Specifically we are looking for:


Graphic designers (3D modeling of all kinds)

Voice actors

Scientists (can be male or female, specific voice doesn’t matter, but you should be able to “sound smart” and handle some technobabble lines)
Various supporting roles for a few lines (different voices, male and female)



PR (if you have experience with marketing games and spreading the word about them, you might be of help)
Questions and feedback welcome!
If anything is unclear or you have any questions, feel free to contact us or post a comment. Any kinds of feedback is also most welcome!",16.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are Pig Dog Games, a small indie startup comprised of 5 core members with 12+ years of combined development experience. We've shipped multiple titles for studios like Sony Online, Namco, Electronic Arts, and Rocketeer Games. Our focus is making AAA titles for PC, MAC and console.  We've worked for some of the biggest studios and have now decided to plant our own flag and build a small indie studio for our third person shooter project <strong>""The Misfits""</strong>.</p>
<p>We've been working on this game for two years, remotely, after work hours, with zero budget and a tremendous amount of coffee. We'd love to start our own studio one day and quit our day jobs to work full-time on The Misfits.</p>

<p>We have eight themed arenas planned for Steam release. Each uniquely themed location contains elevated sections, streamlined multiple paths and secondary routes to promote game play experience. Our goal is to have no wasted game play space. Arenas include the following:</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
We are Pig Dog Games, a small indie startup comprised of 5 core members with 12+ years of combined development experience. We've shipped multiple titles for studios like Sony Online, Namco, Electronic Arts, and Rocketeer Games. Our focus is making AAA titles for PC, MAC and console.  We've worked for some of the biggest studios and have now decided to plant our own flag and build a small indie studio for our third person shooter project ""The Misfits"".
We've been working on this game for two years, remotely, after work hours, with zero budget and a tremendous amount of coffee. We'd love to start our own studio one day and quit our day jobs to work full-time on The Misfits.
The Misfits Game
 

We have eight themed arenas planned for Steam release. Each uniquely themed location contains elevated sections, streamlined multiple paths and secondary routes to promote game play experience. Our goal is to have no wasted game play space. Arenas include the following:

Palawan (Island)
Dragons Back (Desert)
City Station (Light Rail City Themed)
Plaza Station (Outdoor Mall)
The Bog (Swamp)
Lucky Dice (Casino)
BT Construction Site (Construction)
​TBD



 
 



Contract Killers 2 Team TDM: Eliminate players for cash to gain bonuses. The higher you streak, the bigger the bounty is on your head.

Contract Wars 4 Team TDM: Eliminate players for cash to gain bonuses. The higher you streak, the bigger the bounty is on your head.

Head Hunter 2 Team VIP: Eliminate VIP's and players to increase your team's total cash score.

Head Hunters 4 Team VIP: Eliminate VIP's and players to increase your team's total cash score.

Blood Bank: The object of this game mode is to kill enemies, pick up their cash and return the cash to one of the timed banks when they become available. The team with the most cash banked wins the match.

Cash Grab: Grab randomly spawned cash bags and dropped cash from enemy kills and return it to your bank. The team with the most cash wins.

King Of The Bill: Accumulate as much cash as you can at key objectives and deposit your cash at timed banks when they become available.

 


 


Assault
SMG
Shotgun 
Mini-Gun
Sniper
Pistol
Grenade Launcher
Grenade
Proximity Mines
Tesla Cannon
Health Pickup

​Mystery Boxes 


 

We have three player classes in this game. Light, Medium and Heavy to allow for multiple playing styles and tactial advantages for team play.


Light: Extremely agile, equipped with a double barrel shotgun with weak health percentage.

Medium: Balanced quick, equipped with an SMG and very formidable.

Heavy: Slower, equipped with an LMG and has a higher health percentage.

At the moment, this project is being totally developed by me since September 2014. Indiegogo campaign money will basically go to soundtrack composing, illustrations and professional translation. And as a stretch goal, translation to other languages.

<p><strong>Puzzlathon </strong>is an idea for a free iPhone <strong>Puzzle Game</strong> that I came up with in Grade 10. </p>
<p>I was going through my ""idea folder"" in Grade 11 (the grade I recently completed) and fell upon this one, which I had forgotten.

<p>Puzzlathon will bring attention to 3 causes; <strong>ASCONN</strong>'s, and two others decided by <strong>backers. </strong>50% of the app.'s revenue will go to ASCONN, 20% to a cause chosen by one backer, 10% to a cause chosen by another backer, and 20% will be used by me on future projects/updates (of which I have many ideas for). </p>

<h3><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.26929621468298137"">Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Welcome to Anatolia 1300 AD, an expandable card game between Byzantine Empire and Turkmens in the 1300's. It will contain about 75 unique scenario, unit, commander, building, attachment and tactic cards. Typical game takes 45-60 minutes. </p>
<h3>Game</h3>
<p>The game is played in familiar PvP (Player versus Player) format. It tries to reconstruct the thematic setting between two factions.  Turkmens are more crowded and highly mobile whereas Byzantians are better equipped and supplemented by mercenaries from various tribes.</p>
<p>Each player selects a new scenario card in each turn and they engage in political and military struggles. Players draw and play cards symbolizing commanders, political characters, military units, attachments, buildings and battle tactics to collect victory points. The game has no dice but employs randomization schemes. Limited book keeping is required thus even younger players can take grasp of the game and play surprisingly well. Your younger rival will enjoy great satisfaction when he deploys a sleeping potion upon your hard fighting hero and leaves him with a snoring sound!. Will you able to turn the tide of history?</p>
<h3><strong>Future</strong></h3>
<p>In the future, we plan to expand this project to a whole line of game composed of two different variants. First variant will be 1-2 player cooperative game in which players will play different Byzantian houses and cooperate to repel attacks of enemy NPC factions such as Latins, Turkmens and Bulgarians. Second variant will be familiar PvP format but with different timeline such as 1200's to drive off Fourth Crusade or 1450's Final Struggle against Mehmed the Conqueror. But before committing more resources, we need to test the waters whether the game will grab enough attention.  </p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We set an initial fixed funding amount of 1500 USD. The first phase PvP game is almost ready in Turkish. Most of the illustrations are completed. Some more play testing and card layout is required.  Translation into English, some localization and editorial services will be needed. Funds will be used to pay standing bills and create an arsenal of ideas and illustrations for project expansion.  Game mechanics will also need vast changes for cooperative game.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Turkish Law requires lots of bureaucratic work to ship commercial stuff to abroad so I will keep perks in Print and Play form for now. Basically for 10 USD, you will get a license to print 1 copy of the PvP game in English which will be emailed to you in pdf format. You can play as you like it or give it as a gift. Other producer level perks are also available and encouraged. </p>
<p>Since this is a fixed budget project, funds will return to contributors if we don't reach our funding goal.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute for some reason, please spread the word to maybe interested individuals by sharing the campaign link. If you know someone who can help to publish game in US, please contact.  </p>

<p>I'm seeding the House with dozens and dozens of hand-designed rooms - gems of narrative carefully scattered through a procedurally-generated world. The game is currently able to generate over 1 million rooms, each of them unique, but the hand-designed rooms risk getting lost if the number available is not limited. So, on release, there will be approximately 40,000 rooms to explore. This limit not only leads to a balanced experience, but also means I have the ability to add more rooms with ease. Unless the game fails this Kickstarter, or is a total commercial failure, I plan to continue to add new rooms and settings to the House as new ideas come to me.  </p>
<p>The game you play on release will be a complete game. But new content will constantly be added. New places to discover. New characters. Established content will be deepened. More and more branches will be added to existing storylines.</p>
<p>For £5 now, you could have access to a game that will continue growing for years to come. And of course, I'll maintain my <a href=""http://pixeltrickerygames.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dev log</a> all the while!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Here are the main risks or problems I can foresee:</p>
<p>1) Feature Creep. If the game is commercially successful, I want to continue to update the game with free content, 'expanding' the House after release. But I mustn't do this during the development process! ‘Feature creep' is a notorious problem in game development, and if I fall prey to it I might slip behind schedule. The fact that I'm aware of this risk will help to mitigate it - I just need to ensure that I stick to my plans, which are already ambitious enough.</p>
<p>2) Data Loss. Losing data to corruption, burglary, or some other minor disaster has the potential to set the project back a great deal. To mitigate this risk, I’m making regular back-ups online, as well as regular back-ups to a laptop and 4 different external USB devices.</p>
<p>3) Compatibility. I've been testing the game on various different machines, from gaming rigs to laptops, and I've already found several problems only appearing on one machine that I've had to iron out. Towards the end of the development cycle, this could end up eating a lot more of my time than anticipated. To mitigate this risk, I've allotted a very generous period of time for facing this challenge in my schedule.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Right now, Linux has some great programming libraries for developing games, but when it comes to working as a level designer or an artist, the tools are lagging behind Windows and Mac OS X. It’s not from lack of trying. There are great developers working on tools day and night for Linux, but the going is slow. Unity announced an export option for their engine so that game developers on Mac and Windows can export to Linux. This is EXCELLENT news for Linux game players. It’s the same news as always for Linux game developers: to make games: buy a Mac or pay for Windows if you want to make games.<br/><br/>We started this campaign to change that message. We want Linux to be a first-class citizen for game developers. We recently open sourced <a href=""http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque-3d"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Torque 3D</a> under the MIT license, and the first deluge of questions were about Linux compatibility. The move to open source Torque was something that the founders of <a href=""http://www.garagegames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GarageGames</a> wanted to do over 10 years ago, but they also needed a business model for their studio.<br/><br/>Torque is the engine that was originally used in the Tribes series of games, and has seen a number of advancements throughout its history. Since open sourcing it, we have had nearly 300 forks of the codebase on GitHub. You can find out more information about Torque at the GarageGames site and download it from <a href=""https://github.com/garagegames/torque3d"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GitHub</a> to kick the tires. Unfortunately, it’s only for Windows right now, so you might have to flex your Wine or dual-booting muscles to try it out.<strong><strong><br/><br/></strong></strong></p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>What’s In It for All of Us?</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">We want a dedicated Linux-native game development platform. We don’t think that Linux game developers should have to switch between machines so that they can develop on Windows and just test on Linux. We don’t think that they should have to fiddle with Wine to get the simplest of editors to work natively, only to have the whole thing crash when importing models. We want Linux to be a native platform for game developers.</p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>Workflow for Engines without Native Support</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you use any of the popular engines out there that have Linux support, here is a workflow (assuming dual-booting).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Open editor. Import models, edit level, add logic, etc. Build the game. Export to Linux. Copy the binary to a shared drive. Reboot and load Linux. Copy from the shared drive locally. Run the game. Crash. Get crash report. Copy crash report to shared drive. Reboot. Load engine and crash report. Find mistake and attempt to repair. Repeat.<br/><br/>This loop is a little faster if you have two computers next to each other and a shared device, but even then you’re switching gears and doing a lot of waiting. Waiting means that you have time to get coffee or check Slashdot for news, but it’s also time that you could be making your game.<strong><strong><br/><br/></strong></strong></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>Our Solution: Linux-Native Game Development</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>Obvious, right? Well, it should be. But it’s also an answer that takes a lot of time and money to implement. When commercial software companies look at their bottom line, the return on investment for developing software for Linux is really low (and often unknown) in the game engine development world. John Carmack noted during his keynote at QuakeCon that “Valve announcing Steam Linux support changes things a bit but we have made two forays into Linux commercial market, most recently with Quake Live client but that platform just hasn't carried its weight compared to Mac” (45:26, QuakeCon 2012 - John Carmack Keynote). This was specifically about game targets, but the lack of commercial editor support for game development on Linux speaks volumes on how the engine industry feels about Linux.<br/><br/>Luckily, our platform layer has some of the core functionality needed for a Linux port. Our dedicated server has been used on Linux for a number of years with different games, and that handles much of the core engine functionality. What currently is not working on Linux is the game editor and shared client. That’s where you come in.<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>So, How Will the Money be Used?</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Well, this is an experiment to see if crowd funding can pay for specific features that people really want in a game engine.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What we are asking for is enough money, based on a number of estimates from strong Linux developers who have ported large codebases in the past, to make this port happen. The estimates were between two and three months for a single, dedicated developer. We chose three months to accommodate any found-work that can come up. As software developers, we know that once you start down a path, new work will be discovered, so we wanted to make sure to include a buffer for it.<br/><br/>The project will pay $45 an hour for roughly 3 months worth of work from a single developer (a team can be hired to increase productivity, but there will be a finite amount of money from the campaign to pay them). Of course, IndieGoGo will get 4% off the top for hosting the service. The payment providers (credit cards, PayPal, etc) will get roughly 3-4% depending on international fees, etc. Then, the prize tiers will be fulfilled, shirts and such bought and shipped! The remainder of the money will go towards the development team porting Torque 3D to Linux.<strong><strong><br/><br/></strong></strong></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>When Will We See Updates?</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">As it is developed. That’s right. Torque 3D is open source and up on Github right now. You can download it and take it to town, kick the tires, and see what it’s all about. There will also be a Linux branch live on GitHub where you can watch the developers porting the engine to Linux. You get to see the benefits immediately. You do not have to wait a long time watching for infrequent updates, hoping to see something in a year or two. You will have full access to the development branch of the Linux port to see the team’s progress, commit by commit.<br/><br/>But even if we do not reach our goal, and your money goes right back in your pockets, we think you’ll see a Linux port eventually. It just won’t be nearly as quick since the developers have jobs, families, bills, and they’re doing the port of a very large engine in their limited free time. Why not hire them so that the port can be their full-time job? That’s what we want to do.<br/><br/>Our first platform target is 32b Ubuntu, with stretch goals for other platforms to be announced.<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>

<p>Well, we certainly hope that everyone had a great holiday season and are enjoying the start of a new year! Over the break, we tossed around a couple of ideas on how to make our Torque 3D for Linux campaign even better. We took the advice of people here and out and about on the internet and we received a very strong endorsement from Mode 7 Games.</p>
<p>One of the great things about creating game development technology for as long as we have, is that we have some amazing developers who have created absolutely amazing games with our tech. Mode 7 Games is one of those development teams. Their game, Frozen Synapse, won the audience choice award at the Independent Games Festival and the 2011 strategy game of the year from PC Gamer. It is also available on Steam for Linux since their top-notch team did the port themselves.</p>
<p>Paul Taylor had this to say about their company and Torque on Linux:<br/>“Torque has been essential to our success as an indie development studio: its flexibility coupled with its power means that it is the ideal platform for Mode 7.</p>
<p>Through our experience with Humble Bundle and now with Valve’s Steam for Linux, we’ve found that there is a thriving market for indie games on Linux. We would love to get more directly involved with our own Linux versions: Torque for Linux would allow us to do this.</p>
<p>The success of this fundraising drive would make a huge difference to us and a host of other indie developers. We’re happy to provide copies of Frozen Synapse as an incentive for you to support this important project.""</p>
<p>They are generously donating copies of Frozen Synapse to anyone who pledges $25 or more to the Torque 3D for Linux campaign.</p>
<p>In other news, we’re opening three new tiers and removing the $10,000 tier.</p>
<p>The first two tiers are an hour of dedicated support with Eric or I (or the appropriate GarageGames employee). We will provide dedicated support on game development problems, Torque-specific issues, business development strategies, real-time optimization techniques, profiling resources, code analysis, or whatever help you really need to finish your game. My tier is $100 and Eric’s is $250.</p>
<p>The next tier that we are adding is $7000 and includes a trip to Vegas, dinner with a number of GarageGames employees, and a five-star hotel stay here.

I was between jobs and had time on my hands, so I decided to work on a new game to keep me busy.</p><p>What began as a mere experiment became and increasingly exciting reality. <b>This game was awesome!</b> Unfortunately (or fortunately) I found a job and I couldn't invest as much time as I'd like on the game.</p><p>I find myself, once again, between jobs, and an opportunity is presented to me: ""Why not get a full-time job making this game?"".</p><p><b>Where would the funds go?</b></p><p>Funds are mainly required to hire external <b>art</b>, purchase <b>music</b> licenses, acquire needed <b>software</b> or plugins, etc. Part of it will also be used to promote the game and <b>build a fan base</b> for it. This will help us find an interested <b>publisher</b> that can give the game's distribution that extra push.</p><p>Mainly though, the funds are so that I can spend more time actually making the game! The principal problem until now has been having to work on it for a couple of days, letting it go for weeks (in order to work so I could pay for my food), forgetting most of the stuff I did, getting back to it, trying to figure out where I left off... you see where this is going. Part of the funds will be used a salary so that I can develop the game full-time.</p><p><b>You're basically becoming my bosses</b>: hiring me to finally complete the game!</p><p>The depth of the final product will therefore depend on how much is eventually funded (in other words, how long I can invest on it depends on the budget limit). The minimum we need to make a complete running game is 5000 euro, so if we raise less than that, the project will be put on stand-by and you will receive your money back.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Fashionistas (supporters)</h3><p>What is so awesome about becoming a supporter?

Although I will also be partaking in graphic design, writing, producing and basically wherever I'm needed.You can check out my gamer site at www.AlineGames.com or my filmmaker site at www.Xalabarde.comKlara GuillenKlara has been a fashion teacher, she has created numerous luxury collections, and has constantly been supporting young fashion designers. She alone has over 30 years experience in the industry and is an extremely active, strong and independent woman overall. And I'm not just saying that because she's my mom.She keeps the game fidelity in track when it comes to designing and manufacturing clothes. She knows exactly what products are needed, what clients seek, and how to deliver it successfully.Also, she's my mom.You may visit her site at www.KlaraGuillen.comInaki XalabardeInaki has worked in the leather goods industry in companies from South Africa, Spain and United States, including top brands such as Coach (#1 in the US). He is a true craftsman in every sense of the word.He is the numbers guy. He knows every trend cycle, what materials are best used for which collections, which markets are the strongest choice for your product, how to economize your production line, and pretty much any overlooked facts on the reality of this industry.Also, he's my dad.You?We will, of course, include many others in our team as things get more complex. For the time being, I could manage on my own, but I'll eventually need to hire artists, musicians, coders, etc. If you think you'd make a great addition to the team, don't hesitate to contact us!The ProjectThe idea for the game started more than a year ago when I was visiting my parents. I was between jobs and had time on my hands, so I decided to work on a new game to keep me busy.What began as a mere experiment became and increasingly exciting reality. This game was awesome! Unfortunately (or fortunately) I found a job and I couldn't invest as much time as I'd like on the game.I find myself, once again, between jobs, and an opportunity is presented to me: ""Why not get a full-time job making this game?"".Where would the funds go?Funds are mainly required to hire external art, purchase music licenses, acquire needed software or plugins, etc. Part of it will also be used to promote the game and build a fan base for it. This will help us find an interested publisher that can give the game's distribution that extra push.Mainly though, the funds are so that I can spend more time actually making the game! The principal problem until now has been having to work on it for a couple of days, letting it go for weeks (in order to work so I could pay for my food), forgetting most of the stuff I did, getting back to it, trying to figure out where I left off... you see where this is going. Part of the funds will be used a salary so that I can develop the game full-time.You're basically becoming my bosses: hiring me to finally complete the game!The depth of the final product will therefore depend on how much is eventually funded (in other words, how long I can invest on it depends on the budget limit). The minimum we need to make a complete running game is 5000 euro, so if we raise less than that, the project will be put on stand-by and you will receive your money back.The Fashionistas (supporters)What is so awesome about becoming a supporter? Well, firstly, you can make your friends call you an official ""Fashionista"". How cool is that?Secondly, you'll be part of a fashion game! Starting from, having a credit as the one who believed in it, followed it from the beginning and made it happen! So much so that you can even get your name to be, literally, part of the game. Your name can appear in the game as a random name! That's not all. I bet a lot of times you've wondered how video games are made. Now you can live it step by step with Beta Zone.What is Beta Zone?Beta Zone is the place where you can become part of the making of the game itself! You can play updated demos and give your feedback straight from your own personal account on our site. You will follow it every step of the way and be able to experience it as it is being made!It'll be like having a baby you don't have to take care of, play with it, and watch it grow!Find out more on our official site: www.FashionDesignerPro.comFAQWhy is iPhone & iPad not guaranteed?Android is a lot more open when it comes to user-created content, whereas Apple has strict norms and approval procedures. It is in our interest to How much will the retail price of the game be?Our supporters (10 euros or above) have access to the game for free. As for the retail price to the general public, we are heading towards a modest price of around 99 cents. This price is just an expectation, but it's not fixed and it may vary depending on the project's evolution.Why use Construct 2 to develop the game?As I mentioned before, I am a Game Designer, with skills in graphic design. I have very little knowledge of coding. With other methods, I'd have to hire external coders to develop the game, which would increase the budget exponentially, having to sacrifice many of the game's features along the way.Since it's a 2D game for mobile platforms, Construct 2 gives me the opportunity to make this indie game truly independent. I don't rely on others to finish it off. I've been using Construct 2 and similar software for years, and it is a great tool for this sort of 'relatively small' projects.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I just posted a couple more video links in the gallery section showing a couple more of my very latest editing examples (including the AEG Coils of Madness trailer) for the editing perks.</p>
<h3>Funding Contest</h3>
<p>IndieGoGo Funding Contest: If we are fully funded, The person that get's the most funding for us will win at least $800 Store credit. Second Place $200 Store Credit and Third Place $50 Store Credit! Just log onto IndieGogo, copy the link registered to your name from the indieGogo site and spread it around (in a non spammer manner)! For anyone not local to the store and they win the contest there will be no shipping costs. For every $5,000 we exceed our goal we will add another 10% to each of the store credit amounts. The only rules is no blatant spamming which would include random mass emailing and automation. </p>
<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>My Name is Ron Petersen and I started planning The Gamer's Grind back in early 2010. Funded with a small inheritance, our doors opened in March 2012. My intention was to use the tools left to me to build something unique and provide some much needed entertainment to our local community: a board game café!</p>
<p>What qualifies me to take on something so ambitious? I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>I have a diverse background in retail and distributor sales as well as running a small business. I have experience with shipping and receiving, video production, working in the media. But most of all, I have a passion for people and games.</p>
<p>In researching our business plan I discovered a place called Snakes and Lattes that had just opened in Toronto Canada. They've enjoyed great success, doubling their store's size and acquiring a liquor license. Their success shows us that the board game café model clearly works.</p>
<h3>Our Mission and Vision</h3>
<p>Our mission is to provide the ultimate game night experience. We believe every type of game is valuable and can bring friends and family together to share laughs and enjoy each other’s company. We intend to keep building up the wall of games to have an extensive library. We want every type of gamer to have a large variety of options to choose from in a comfortable and fun environment, even the pickiest of game enthusiasts. Our mission is also to open people's eyes to just how many games are out there. The more casual or occasional game player may only be aware of what one or two large corporations have to offer, but the game palette we offer is much more varied. But most importantly we want to offer a highly unique entertainment destination. This is still a new business model in North America, and that’s what makes it such a great opportunity!</p>
<h3>What is a Board Game Café?</h3>
<p>Board Game Cafes have been around for a while and are very popular in many Asian countries and some European countries, but hardly any exist in North America. Basically you take a café or coffee house, combine it with a large library of games to play, and throw in a small game store. People come in, pay a small amount and can play games as long as they like while enjoying the available food, snacks, and drinks. Some board game cafes charge by the hour, but we opted for a cover charge instead because we believe it’s more conducive to a relaxing and casual environment. It’s proven successful with Snakes and Lattes in Toronto and we know it can succeed here. Proper food, snacks, and drinks are an important factor too, but to this point we've only been able to offer in a very limited fashion. We are now seeking to remedy this.</p>
<h3>Why The Gamer's Grind isn't a Board Game Cafe Now</h3>
<p>The following is a description of the events which prevented our remodel from including the much needed café and why we were forced to relocate. If this is not relevant or of interest to you feel free to skip ahead.</p>
<p>Our original intention was for The Gamer's Grind to be a board game café from the start. But we were not able to implement the highly important café portion. The main reason was because the landlord failed to honor the agreements made in the lease regarding tenant allowance. This, along with other minor issues forced us to push forward as best we could, but we finally had to relocate. We also had to liquidate all of the café equipment we had purchased but were never able to put to use.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our current form and location are not sustainable. We are still open for now, but will likely shut down in a month in an effort to start a reboot as a proper board game café (even if we are not funded here).</p>
<h3>To avoid similar issues this time around, we will do the following:</h3>
<p>We will not enter any agreement requiring major building upgrades that are not funded up front by the landlord. The space we choose will have to be readily suitable for a café that’s in full regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>The location would have to be in an area with an active nightlife and would have previously included a café, coffee house or sandwich shop so major remodeling won’t be necessary. We have already scouted and found a couple of suitable locations.</p>
<h3>Our Goal for this Campaign</h3>
<p>We are seeking funding to do a complete reboot of The Gamer's Grind. Full funding will cover the cost to move into a higher profile location, re-purchase the required café equipment, including a commercial brewer, an espresso machine, blender, a refrigerated serving cooler for sandwiches and paninis.</p>
<p>It will also cover our initial operating capital for expenses like hiring professional individuals experienced in putting together the café side of the business.</p>
<h3>What We Have Already</h3>
<p>We already have the necessary tables, chairs, counters, shelves, retail inventory, office equipment, drink carts, a popcorn popper, over 580 games on the ""Wall of Games"", and all the basic equipment you would expect a small store/business to have.</p>
<h3>Why Support a Board Game Café?</h3>
<p>A board game café offers the community a unique entertainment destination. It presents a new social option for friends and family to hang out and have fun in a relaxed and inviting environment. It's also home to an extensive library of games; you’re pretty much guaranteed to find something you’ve never tried before.</p>
<p>Of course, we also have a large number of valuable Perks to encourage your contribution and make this all possible. A board game café is also a way to try new games before you buy. Many of our regular customers have taken full advantage of that benefit.</p>
<h3>When We Reach Our Goal</h3>
<p>In addition to growing our Wall of Games to at least double its current size of almost 600 titles, we will secure a new location, purchase all the necessary café equipment, bring in a knowledgeable individual with past experience putting together a coffee house/café, and install all necessary shelving and furnishings.</p>
<h3>If We Surpass Our Goal to a $80k Level</h3>
<p>We will get a larger location and purchase a high end dedicated RPG table.</p>
<h3>If (by some craziness) we Surpass Our Goal to a $300k Level</h3>
<p>Once established and operating smoothly we will soon after look to other cities for a second location. Top contributor opinions will be given first consideration. Every $300k level we hit we will consider yet another location. This is not likely to say the least but if it does that is what will happen.</p>
<h2>Perks for Contributing</h2>
<h3>Local Perks:</h3>
<p>For individuals local to the Sacramento area or if you choose to gift your perk to someone local, there are several Wall of Games passes and drink combination offers.</p>
<h3>Local &amp; Non Local Perks:</h3>
<p>For both local and non-local contributors there are several options for game purchases of 40% off manufacturer suggested retail prices (MSRP).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Promo Card Perks: (This list will be updated as more promo items come in)</h3>
<p>Promo Card Perks may include any 3 of the following random promo cards in no particular order: Aquarious Flux Cards, Hastur Flux Cards, Star Fluxx Button, The Resistance Merlin &amp; Assassin cards, Belfort Guild Guild Promo Pack #1, Tsuro of the Seas promo pieces, D&amp;D Board game Vierna Do'urden Drow Card, Catan Great River mini expansion, Dork Tower Poster (Dice plotting to kill you), Mini sample game of Spot it, Mini Sample Game of Reverse Charades Jr. Evil Baby Orphange Heinrich Himmler card and more on the way which will be added later.</p>
<p>NOTE: Promo card packs will be random but if you purchase this contribution level and contribute another amount we will let you pick one of the promo items (if it has not been spoken for) with the remaining 2 random. Contact us first to be sure it has not been spoken for.</p>
<h3>NOTES on 40% Off game purchase Perks:</h3>
<p>The vast majority of the games we carry or have access to are eligible for this offer. There might be a very tiny percentage of items that we would have to price at our cost to avoid losing money. This is not likely to come up often, but we want to mention that it is a rare possibility. The offer applies to any game we can acquire from our distributors.</p>
<p>Please also note that some of our normal in-store prices are 10-20% below Manufacture Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). The 40% discount is not off our marked prices, but from MSRP. This offer is non-transferable and can only be redeemed by the contributing individual. If shipped, it can only be shipped to the confirmed address of the contributor. Shipping and Taxes may apply.</p>
<p>In the case of shipping you can choose either UPS or USPS. Shipping will be an additional charge but we will only charge the cost of shipping. We will not up charge for shipping or add on any ""handling"" charges. Shipped orders will be placed by phone. Individuals claiming this perk that require shipping will have to provide a name, address and the last 4 digits of the credit card they will be using. Shipped orders will only be to the recorded address and individual. On the off chance we close down or down size we will be able to continue to honor this perk operating out of a smaller place that just processes orders.</p>

<h3>What is Sandman: Escape From Dreamland</h3>
<p>It's after lunch on a warm summers day. Martin is trapped in an important, although boring, meeting and is desperately trying to keep his eyes open. Slowly he nods off to sleep. Suddenly he ""awakens"" to find the Sandman, who informs him of his fate. Sandman has lost his power and they are both stuck. Help Martin regain the Sandman's power and escape dreamland. To do this you must run, jump, slide or otherwise traverse through various dreams to collect hourglasses - the source of Sandman's power. Guide Martin on the journey of a lifetime as you traverse surreal and wonderful dreamscapes using your epic platforming skills. Watch out for McCoy, Sandman's dastardly nemesis.</p>
</div>
<div>Sandman: Escape From Dreamland is a 3D platformer for PC. We designed this game to be similar to console style 3D platformers, because we feel this is a genre that the PC is somewhat lacking in at the moment.</div>

<h3>Features and General Info</h3>
<ul>
<li>An Alpha version will be released to supporters by mid August. The alpha version will include 15 levels from 5 different worlds.</li>
<li>The final version of the game will feature over 80 levels, which are split between 16 different worlds and four other environments.</li>
<li>Not all levels are about platforming skill, some also feature some tough puzzles that will make you think.</li>
<li>Planned for completion by the end of January 2014.</li>

<li>Get the Alpha build of the game to test for bugs and, more importantly, what we call the fun factor.</li>
<li>Have your say, as you also gain access to our development forums to make your voices heard.</li>
<li>For major supporters (The forty (+10) Winks pack and above) we will be releasing exclusive preview levels demonstrating newly implemented features.</li>

<img alt=""Poster and shirt"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://greatfirestudios.com/sandman/poster_shirt.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Poster and shirt""/><br/><h3>Who are we</h3>
<p>A small game and simulation development company from Adelaide, Australia. We've been around for just over a year now and have previously been focussed on contract programming work for training simulators. For the last four months we have slowly been focussing more and more on creating Sandman. Now we believe that Sandman is now ready for the world to see and want to take the prototype we have and finish it.</p>
<h3>What we need to do this</h3>
<p>If you regularly look at crowdfunds for video games you will surely know that $10,000 is on the rather low end of the spectrum for funding games. How are we planning on completing Sandman with this funding? Easy. First of all our company consists of only two people. Secondly we already own all the necessary software licenses to create the game. Thirdly we already have large chunks of the game code complete. The funds go directly to cost of living expenses as we zerg out to complete the game as fast as possible, to the highest quality possible. Whilst $10,000 is enough to complete the basic version of the game we have designed many more features and mechanics, which will be introduced should we exceed our target. Stay tuned as we get closer to our goals as we will be announcing stretch goals and the features/extensions they contain.</p>

It's after lunch on a warm summers day. Martin is trapped in an important, although boring, meeting and is desperately trying to keep his eyes open. Slowly he nods off to sleep. Suddenly he ""awakens"" to find the Sandman, who informs him of his fate. Sandman has lost his power and they are both stuck. Help Martin regain the Sandman's power and escape dreamland. To do this you must run, jump, slide or otherwise traverse through various dreams to collect hourglasses - the source of Sandman's power. Guide Martin on the journey of a lifetime as you traverse surreal and wonderful dreamscapes using your epic platforming skills. Watch out for McCoy, Sandman's dastardly nemesis.

Sandman: Escape From Dreamland is a 3D platformer for PC. We designed this game to be similar to console style 3D platformers, because we feel this is a genre that the PC is somewhat lacking in at the moment.
 


Features and General Info

An Alpha version will be released to supporters by mid August. The alpha version will include 15 levels from 5 different worlds.
The final version of the game will feature over 80 levels, which are split between 16 different worlds and four other environments.
Not all levels are about platforming skill, some also feature some tough puzzles that will make you think.
Planned for completion by the end of January 2014.

 



Be a part of it
By supporting us in our endeavours to make this game you too become part of the team that makes a game happen.

Get the Alpha build of the game to test for bugs and, more importantly, what we call the fun factor.
Have your say, as you also gain access to our development forums to make your voices heard.
For major supporters (The forty (+10) Winks pack and above) we will be releasing exclusive preview levels demonstrating newly implemented features.

 
Who are we
A small game and simulation development company from Adelaide, Australia. We've been around for just over a year now and have previously been focussed on contract programming work for training simulators. For the last four months we have slowly been focussing more and more on creating Sandman. Now we believe that Sandman is now ready for the world to see and want to take the prototype we have and finish it.
What we need to do this
If you regularly look at crowdfunds for video games you will surely know that $10,000 is on the rather low end of the spectrum for funding games. How are we planning on completing Sandman with this funding? Easy. First of all our company consists of only two people. Secondly we already own all the necessary software licenses to create the game. Thirdly we already have large chunks of the game code complete. The funds go directly to cost of living expenses as we zerg out to complete the game as fast as possible, to the highest quality possible. Whilst $10,000 is enough to complete the basic version of the game we have designed many more features and mechanics, which will be introduced should we exceed our target. Stay tuned as we get closer to our goals as we will be announcing stretch goals and the features/extensions they contain.

</div></div>","The Game
Traitor is a first-person shooter game for mobile devices and tablets. The game tells the story of desperate renegade German Army officer and his plot against Hitler during World War II. Colonel Claus decide to become a hitman. The game emplies stealth, disguise, hand-to-hand assassinations.

The Plan
So far we have invested our own money developing and popularizing android version of the game.  We want to do the same for pc and ios, especially ipad.
If you are android user the android version is ready now, you can download and test it!
Download Test Version
 Please leave us your views and comments so that we can refine our game-play and make a game you really love.

Why we need your support

With so much noise and content in the mobile gaming space, it is hard for new developers to reach fans. Help from a big company, means losing control of the project so we are asking you.





Risks & Challenges

  No crowdfunding campaign is entirely without risks, but the ones here aren't too big. However, a project like this one can suffer delays for a number of reasons.
Spread the Word!


Make some noise - word of mouth is still the best promotion!
Indiegogo has share tools - use them!

Don’t hesitate to talk about this project to others around you and to share it on social networks.  If you follow blogs, celebrities or press journalists, ask them to take a look and to talk about the project.",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Send Domo to Evo!</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Thor, but most people in the FGC just know me as Domo.</p>

<p>I'm making this IGG campaign to help get me to the largest fighting game tournament on earth: Evo.</p>
<p>Going to Evo has been a dream of mine ever since I first heard of it, but times have been very tough for my family's business. We can't afford hiring other employees or having salaries for ourselves, so a trip to Las Vegas is impossible for me right now.</p>

<p>We've been working on Pengame since 2007, only as a hobby. Then this year we erased everything and started from scratch - this time not just as a hobby project, but something we'd like to release eventually.</p>
<p>Pengame is a side scrolling shoot ’em up, with platforming elements. The combat is going to be fast paced, and skill based, involving different types of weapons, combo based melee attacks, an RPG-like skill tree and of course bullet time.</p>

<p>All graphics are hand drawn and animated frame by frame, giving the game a nice minimalistic aestethic. According to the plot everything was drawn by a 16 years old kid in his book during a boring class.Therefore initially we wanted the game to look like something anyone could draw... Well, our artists got a bit carried away there, so the game actually looks like it could have been drawn by anyone with the talents and expertise of a professional graphic designer. :)</p>
<p>The enemies are somewhat grotesque and nightmarish. Similar to the stuff we doodled in our high school years. Mechanical nodding rhinos, giant snails with cannons on their back, little cute demons playing electrical guitars, giant irish thugs with a can of beer in their hand - anything you can imagine, but probably wouldn't!</p>

<p>The level design is just as twisted as the enemies in looks.

<p>There was this 16 years old kid, who hated school. Imagine that. He just kept doodling in his exercise book during class, creating a wonderful world. The doodles were happy and free.

Only a couple of them managed to hide, but none had the courage to fight back.<br/><br/> The Kid seeing the corruption drew four warriors to defeat the Teacher and restore order in the book, but they all failed, and got corrupted themselves.

Well, that one book, really, but it's a quite big one!<br/><br/><br/><br/> Number Five (#5) or Stickman is our main protagonist. Since he is only made out of simplistic lines and dots he is extremely agile. His abilities are tied with his minimalistic form, meaning he is able to adapt and endure.

<p><span class=""font_8"">Humans vs. Zombies is a game of tag normally played on college campuses. Participants are required to wear a bright green bandana around their arm or on their head to identify them as being part of the game and to differentiate whether they are human or zombie.  Participants start as humans and defend themselves from zombie players using foam dart blasters (Nerf, Air Zone, etc.) or socks to “stun” them.  Once tagged a human player becomes a zombie; thus creating a fight for human survival (or zombie domination) for the duration of gameplay.<br/><br/>Due to the limited space available for this event, registration is limited to 120 participants.</span></p>

The Texas Zombiefest Invitational Game is a weekend long game of HvZ. Hosted at Camp Woodlake in Brownwood, Texas by the Texas Tech Zombie Raiders student organizations.  The game is free to play, but payment is required for on-site accommodations.  This includes a place to sleep for two nights, 3 meals, and evening entertainment.  See specific options on right.

For more information on the event, see our website: http://greywindevents.wix.com/texaszombiefest

 
 
PLEASE READ ALL OF THE INFORMATION BELOW BEFORE REGISTERING.What is HvZ?
Humans vs. Zombies is a game of tag normally played on college campuses. Participants are required to wear a bright green bandana around their arm or on their head to identify them as being part of the game and to differentiate whether they are human or zombie.  Participants start as humans and defend themselves from zombie players using foam dart blasters (Nerf, Air Zone, etc.) or socks to “stun” them.  Once tagged a human player becomes a zombie; thus creating a fight for human survival (or zombie domination) for the duration of gameplay.Due to the limited space available for this event, registration is limited to 120 participants.
 
More information can be found at:http://humansvszombies.org/


Why We Need You!
As a Student Organization attempting to run our first invitational event, we need to secure funding for the event in advance to ensure that we can get this event off the ground!  You can help us make this possible by registering to play or donating funds towards the event.Why are we crowdfunding this event through IndieGoGo and using it for registration and reserving player accommodations?

It protects you. If we don't make the funding goal needed to run this event, the money is immediately returned to you.
It protects us.  It ensures that we have the minimum funding needed to run this event, so we don't have to worry about refunding everyone their money or dealing with additional fees or financial losses. It also allows us to make sure we have the money needed to pay for the event ahead of time.
IndieGoGo allows us to set the exact number of spots available for each type of accommodation so it will only accept payment for the space that we have.

 
Donations will help us to pay for:

Camp fees and deposits.
Deposits and payments for events.
Building costs of game props and other key pieces for use in the game’s storyline.

This is a fixed funding campaign, if we do not reach our goal, all money will be returned to registrants and the event will be canceled. Help us out!
You can also submit donations via the $5  “Helping Out Anyway I Can” option on the right. Please do not submit donations via the accommodations options (unless you are planning to attend) as that will register you as a player for the weekend and a registration spot will be removed unnecessarily.

<p><strong>The history</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After generations of functional prototypes, we have fully optimized the FieldWiz hardware for reduced size, complexity, and power consumption. Meanwhile, we’ve enhanced our algorithm and basic application through test games with several teams of different levels. We gathered feedback over the last six months from team staff and players, which has resulted in the actionable data – and the best value. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Now: we need your help!</b></p>
<p>The electronic device and the vest are ready to be produced. The alpha version of the software is developed and has been used to test the current prototypes. To make it a world class multi-platform application (iOS and Android), we need your help! Reaching our goal will allow us to hire the needed development force and  give you the best user experience.</p>
<p><b>The future: it’s only the beginning!</b></p>
<p>The FieldWiz journey will not end after reaching our goal and delivering the first version. It will be the beginning of a long adventure! We have so many features we want to add to FieldWiz, and we keep on innovating. Some future projects will include:</p>
<p>-<span>

FieldWiz
is a strategy and physical performance measuring tool for outdoor team sports
players. It is a standalone device worn on a player’s back to collect statistics, which are synchronized at the end of the game or practice with any mobile device via Bluetooth. Data represented on the mobile application or the online account includes:





Metrics can then be compared between games, players,
positions, etc. and enable you to get the most out of collected data.
Your benefits


Stop guessing, compare objective data


Set goals and measure progress


Adapt your practice sessions to your game behavior


Fill the gap between the as-is and the to-be situation of your strategy


Bring your game experience to the next level




What's new?





Although like systems
are available, they are highly complex - only attainable by the wealthiest
teams with dedicated staff to operate them. FieldWiz aims to make quantified self
technology affordable with a simple to use, standalone system.
The system is
composed of:


One device
One vest
One mobile application (iOS or Android)
A docking station in a caring case for the team
packages
Created in Switzerland, the product is based on a 10hz GPS technology and an accelerometer. The device measures 65mm x 65mm x 10mm and weighs 45 grams. Data is synchronized via Bluetooth to any mobile device with a receiver. The battery for each system lasts for up to 10 hours.
The docking station delivered with the team package includes a metal case and a central charging system. For devices sold individually, a charging USB cable is included.



PLAY - SYNC - ANALYZE - OPTIMIZE
1. Play


It’s easy. Turn on your FieldWiz by pressing the button. A green LED light shows you that it is on. Insert it into the vest.Get ready. Play. It can be used for a governed game or regular practice. 



For teams, each device has a unique number which is then assigned to a player on the mobile application.

2. Sync

At the end of a game or  practice session, collected data is synchronized with your mobile device via Bluetooth. 
1.  Simply start the application on your
mobile device
2.  Make sure the FieldWiz(s) you want to sync are within 5 meters of your mobile device
3.  Follow the steps in your application
to set the parameters required in order to select only relevant data
4.  Set additional variables that will
help you better optimize your game
5.  Wait until the data is synchronized and ready to analyze
Data is synchronized locally on your mobile device as well as online - making it available in your web account on fieldwiz.com.



If you are a team, you will be able to match the devices with the players on the web account or mobile application.







3. Analyze
Heatmaps of the covered zones for each player, replay of whole games, phases of play, physical statistics including sprints, distance, speed and accelerations. All data is represented in a user-friendly interface on your mobile device. Data is also synchronized on the web and can be accessed at any time from your online account. 



4. Optimize

Now, it’s time  to get the most of FieldWiz - interpret the results to gain a competitive edge. There are many ways to optimize your game and FieldWiz could be:
An analysis and
decision making tool allowing you to gather facts and statistics, and compare players between games and positions over time, etc. and in the end, make the best decision. 
A demonstration
toolto better communicate your strategy, show game phase, and compare the “as is” situation with the “should be”.
A motivation tool for you and your players. Set measurable goals during practices and games, track progress and encourage healthy competition within the team.
An entertaining tool to extend the game experience: share, analyze, compare, suggest and discuss with your teammates after a match in the stadium or online.


And so much more, it is up to you…







The history
After generations of functional prototypes, we have fully optimized the FieldWiz hardware for reduced size, complexity, and power consumption. Meanwhile, we’ve enhanced our algorithm and basic application through test games with several teams of different levels. We gathered feedback over the last six months from team staff and players, which has resulted in the actionable data – and the best value. 



Now: we need your help!
The electronic device and the vest are ready to be produced. The alpha version of the software is developed and has been used to test the current prototypes. To make it a world class multi-platform application (iOS and Android), we need your help! Reaching our goal will allow us to hire the needed development force and  give you the best user experience.
The future: it’s only the beginning!
The FieldWiz journey will not end after reaching our goal and delivering the first version. It will be the beginning of a long adventure! We have so many features we want to add to FieldWiz, and we keep on innovating. Some future projects will include:
- 
Heart
rate monitoring integration
- 
Real-time
monitoring
- 
Google
Glass interface
- 
New
metrics
- 
New
reports and practice plans
- 
New
data communication
- 
Ball possession integration
- 
Number
of completed pass
- 
New
algorithm
- 
And
many more…
Be ready for some new innovation! Why not stretch the vision?

JULIEN MOIX: Midfielder
Even though he has been a defender since he was five years old, Julien plays the role of midfielder on FieldWiz's team, distributing requirements between the field-reality and technique. His IT background is a strong asset for the project.
LIONEL YERSIN: Forward
With his track record as an entrepreneur and electronic wizard, he is the one who takes risks and scores goals for FieldWiz.
MICHAËL DIZERENS: Defender
With his strong financial background and football enthusiasm, Michael will  keep FieldWiz safe and healthy. On our team, he is definitively the sweeper.
KEVIN JAQUIER: Rookie


Freshly transferred to the FiedWiz team during the summer “Mercato”, his programming skills will start bringing our mobile application to life.

<p>If it sounds simple, that’s because it is. A gameplay staple probably best-known from the hit arcade game  (and personal childhood favourite) ‘Smash TV’,  given a unique randomly-generated twist and a separate, well-written story mode.</p>
<p>In <strong>Arcade</strong> mode, sectors and their corresponding difficulty level will gradually increase on to infinity, giving you an endless challenge of reflexes and skill.</p>
<p>In <strong>Story</strong> mode, you’ll pass through custom-designed sectors, with stylish cutscenes and a wide variety of interesting characters, in engaging situations, lasting for at least four hours of well-paced gameplay.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there’s the ‘bonus stuff’.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>I am Alfe Clemencio of Sakura River Interactive. I work with a team to make games with interactive stories with gameplay. <strong>I'm starting this crowd funding project to make a game that will set a new standard in interactive storytelling in video games targeted to average gamer.</strong></p>
<p><em>Don’t save the World: An RPG</em> is a game where <strong>the effect of player’s choices are so strong they can change the genre of story and game</strong>. Live a life of adventure (RPG gamplay) or a normal life of running a shop (management-sim). <strong>Say ""No"" to saving the world!</strong></p>
<p>The reason?<strong> I'm tired of being dissapointed at the promises of ""Interactive Stories"" and ""Moral Choices"" in video games.</strong> Usually along the lines of good or evil that doesn't affect gameplay that much.</p>
<p>It has been getting better recently but it's just not enough to give you the experience of <strong>TRUE CHOICES</strong>. (defined as choosing your own goals)</p>
<p><strong>How can my small team and I do what AAA developers have trouble with?</strong> Don't know what to tell you other than <strong>we did a small test pilot of it already with around 80% review scores.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>This is the 2nd Time We're Giving True Choices</strong></h2>
<p>To those that find our claims hard to believe, please be aware that this is the 2nd time we're doing this. We have experience. <a href=""http://sakurariver.ca/main/fading-hearts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Take a look at our first game Fading Hearts!</a> We got the reviews to back what we claim to do.</p>
<h2>Reviews of our First Game - Fading Hearts</h2>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><a href=""http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/Fading_Hearts/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“...pulled twists that challenged my preconceived notions.""</a> -RPGFan.com</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><a href=""http://inside.anime-expo.org/reviews/2011-05/review-fading-hearts-pc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“...the game takes 'choose your own adventure' to a whole other level. You literally have freedom to do whatever you want.”</a> - Inside Anime Expo</p>

<h2 dir=""ltr"">Gameplay</h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">Don’t Save the World has several game genres in one game.<strong> Optional turn-based RPG, optional Management-sim, and to glue them together there is the daily life sim.</strong> There is also the mystery elements of the story that hide away some of deep secrets of what’s possible in the game.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">
<br/>Optional RPG game elements</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">The player does have a choice to take the traditional RPG route. The player can go on a quest to cleanse the lands tainted by the dark lord and then eliminate the dark lord. The RPG battle system will focus on stringing a sequence of different actions together.<strong> Instead of selecting attack all the time with the occasional heal, now players may attack with one weapon and swap to another weapon while the first one cools down.</strong> Or the player could spend most of their turn with stacking damage boosting actions to deal a strong blow. However some enemies are too fast for certain action strings and strong against certain attacks. So one strategy won’t work against all foes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of course if fighting battles isn’t your taste...</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Optional casual style Management Sim</h3>
<div style=""float: right; width: 232px; height: 346px; padding-bottom: 20px;"">

</div>
<p dir=""ltr"">Got too many ultimate weapons with no desire to fight? You can sell them for in-game cash to finance your store! So you can make even more cash! <strong>Choose to live a more simple life of running a shop and earning a profit in a management-sim style game.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Collect quality ingredients and make the best kind of gear that is suited to you. Or create items that would fetch a large price. <strong>Expand to a nearby kingdom</strong> and watch the cash come pouring in.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>In this game, hero takes quests from you!</strong> That’s right! You can send the hero or other mercenaries on quests for items you simply don’t have to time to retrieve, for the right price of course. If you want you can send the hero on a quest in the most dangerous area for a useless item! You can also send them scout areas for new ingredients or handle a surge in monsters. I’m sure the hero would be more than qualified to do the job.</p>

Current Update: Check out an interview by Emily Short here on Don't Save the World.
Short Summary
I am Alfe Clemencio of Sakura River Interactive. I work with a team to make games with interactive stories with gameplay. I'm starting this crowd funding project to make a game that will set a new standard in interactive storytelling in video games targeted to average gamer.
Don’t save the World: An RPG is a game where the effect of player’s choices are so strong they can change the genre of story and game. Live a life of adventure (RPG gamplay) or a normal life of running a shop (management-sim). Say ""No"" to saving the world!
The reason? I'm tired of being dissapointed at the promises of ""Interactive Stories"" and ""Moral Choices"" in video games. Usually along the lines of good or evil that doesn't affect gameplay that much.
It has been getting better recently but it's just not enough to give you the experience of TRUE CHOICES. (defined as choosing your own goals)
How can my small team and I do what AAA developers have trouble with? Don't know what to tell you other than we did a small test pilot of it already with around 80% review scores.
This is the 2nd Time We're Giving True Choices
To those that find our claims hard to believe, please be aware that this is the 2nd time we're doing this. We have experience. Take a look at our first game Fading Hearts! We got the reviews to back what we claim to do.
Reviews of our First Game - Fading Hearts
“...pulled twists that challenged my preconceived notions."" -RPGFan.com
“...the game takes 'choose your own adventure' to a whole other level. You literally have freedom to do whatever you want.” - Inside Anime Expo
“It has an interesting story to tell, which can be as realistic, convoluted or outlandish as you want it to be.” -technologytell.com
Gameplay
Don’t Save the World has several game genres in one game. Optional turn-based RPG, optional Management-sim, and to glue them together there is the daily life sim. There is also the mystery elements of the story that hide away some of deep secrets of what’s possible in the game.

Optional RPG game elements
The player does have a choice to take the traditional RPG route. The player can go on a quest to cleanse the lands tainted by the dark lord and then eliminate the dark lord. The RPG battle system will focus on stringing a sequence of different actions together. Instead of selecting attack all the time with the occasional heal, now players may attack with one weapon and swap to another weapon while the first one cools down. Or the player could spend most of their turn with stacking damage boosting actions to deal a strong blow. However some enemies are too fast for certain action strings and strong against certain attacks. So one strategy won’t work against all foes.
Of course if fighting battles isn’t your taste...
Optional casual style Management Sim

The Flower Girl

Got too many ultimate weapons with no desire to fight? You can sell them for in-game cash to finance your store! So you can make even more cash! Choose to live a more simple life of running a shop and earning a profit in a management-sim style game.
Collect quality ingredients and make the best kind of gear that is suited to you. Or create items that would fetch a large price. Expand to a nearby kingdom and watch the cash come pouring in.
In this game, hero takes quests from you! That’s right! You can send the hero or other mercenaries on quests for items you simply don’t have to time to retrieve, for the right price of course. If you want you can send the hero on a quest in the most dangerous area for a useless item! You can also send them scout areas for new ingredients or handle a surge in monsters. I’m sure the hero would be more than qualified to do the job.
Daily Life Simulation
Everyday the player chooses what to do to spend their time. So one day the player can choose to go a nearby area to fight monsters and get treasure. The next day the player can choose to create items, sell them on the market, read the news, talk to the locals. The characters that you meet and talk with have their own story that is connected to the fate of the wider world. Or the player can choose to travel to a different town for a change in scenery. 
Moral Choices, Mystery
I bet you’re wondering about the moral choices and mystery mentioned in Don’t Save the World. How will this be different than any other game that promises moral choices? It’s hard to explain without giving you a concrete example.
Near the end of the game gamers might be given the chance to slow down or stop the hero from defeating the dark lord.
I will guarantee that some players trying to be “good” will try to stop or slow down the hero.
In this scenario you are not the hero and won’t be defeating the dark lord. If the dark lord isn’t stopped then all the lands will be flooded with monsters that will bring the cities and towns to ruin. The hero is definitely a good person and is trying to do good.
It’s because moral choices like this that morality meters won’t work for this kind of game. Can you figure out why gamers trying to do good would do something like stop the hero?
Summary
So there you have it. Optional RPG gameplay, optional management-sim, daily-life sim, moral choices and mystery, and most importantly... true choices where you choose your goal.
