<p>I have been offered a very special opportunity to help promote world peace and planetary sustainability and to represent our community and Paganism at the highest level on the world stage.</p>
<p>I have been invited to join the Dalai Lama’s International Peace Council and the Association for Global New Thought as a Core Group Leader to help facilitate a world event in Rome, Italy, Awakened World 2012 this October. The event will be attended by many of the foremost political, religious and human rights leaders in the world, and my fellow Core Group team will include such luminaries as: Yolande IIiano, Chairperson, Religions for Peace Europe, HH Pujya Swami Chidananda Saraswati, President of Parmarth Niketan Ashram in India, one of India’s largest spiritual institutions, Sister Joan Chittister, OSB, CO-Chair of the Global Peace Initiative for Women, His Eminence Walter Cardinal Kasper, President, Pontifical Council for Ecumenism, Ela Gandhi, former South African Parliamentarian and granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi, Dean Lawrence Carter, Dean of Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel, Rev. Marcus Braybrooke, President of the World Congress of Faiths, and Lynne Twist of the Pachamama Alliance and others.</p>
<p>Each of the esteemed Core Group Leaders are being supported by their communities to attend and facilitate the gathering, and so I am asking you my spiritual community, to join together and support me also, so our voices will be heard and Paganism and Earth Based Spiritual Traditions will be represented at the table when the discussions regarding the future of our planet take place.</p>
<p>The costs to get me to Rome including all transportation and lodging, which have all been negotiated by the conveners on behalf of the Core Group Leaders, are approximately $3,000.00, not including incidentals which I estimate will probably be another $500. So I will need to raise $3,500.00 in order to be able to go.</p>
<p>But first for those who don’t know me or my work, let me tell you a little about my background and why you should support me in this endeavor.</p>
<p>I have been active in our community for over 40 years both teaching for and also speaking out on our behalf. I have always done so with the belief that our traditions contain key elements that can alter the course of our civilization’s downward spiral by adding new perspectives regarding human rights, social justice, saving the environment, and facilitating world peace. I have served over the last 20 years as an activist for Pagan rights and ending religious discrimination in general, and have successfully taken on and resolved over a thousand discrimination cases for our community, from discrimination in the workplace, to reforming the religion programs in our nation’s prisons. I successfully took on AT&amp;T and got them to alter their official policy which disallowed passwords relating to our beliefs. Words like Goddess, magic, Witch, Wiccan, Pagan, etc., which they had listed as pornography. I have also testified on numerous Pagan’s behalf’s in child custody cases, taken on Children’s services who have removed children from their homes because their parents practiced Paganism, and was an active member of the Pentacle Quest team, who headed and won the fight for Pagan vets to have the pentacle on their military headstones.</p>
<p>In a different arena, I have been active in educating our government regarding Paganism and minority faiths, and have played a significant part in advancing pluralism. I have also been very involved internationally in projects promoting interfaith dialog, and in promoting human rights and equality for all people. I have actively and successfully forged alliances between Buddhists, Hindus, Native Americans and Pagans, so we could work together collectively to resolve common problems.</p>
<p>in 1998 I became the first official government Wiccan chaplain in the United States and in 1999, I received a commendation from the California State Senate for my work developing Pagan religion programs in prisons. In 2008 I was selected to advise the United States Commission on Civil Rights as a Pagan, and my comments were central in reports presented to both Congress and the President of the United States.</p>
<p>In 2009, I was selected to address leaders and representatives from over 70 countries In Astana, Kazakhstan for the development of a Global Constitution, and in 2010 I received the Mahatma Gandhi Award as a Pagan at the Capitol in Washington D.C.. Also in 2010, I was honored to be invited as a World Inner Peace Ambassador at a gathering of 150,000 Buddhists in Bangkok, Thailand. I was also given the title, Sheda Garpo, King of Peace, by Rinpoche Lama Gangchen of the World Peace Foundation.</p>
<p>I have been involved in peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians in Amman Jordan, trained teachers in the Himalayas, and presented at two consecutive Parliaments of the World’s Religions … all openly as a Pagan, sharing Pagan values, and striving to put a positive face on Paganism in general.</p>
<p>Also as a Pagan, I am on the Board of Directors of Children of the Earth, a United Nations NGO, where I serve as Development Director for 20,000 youth involved in international Peace programs. And I serve as both an Executive Council Member and as the Chair of their Minority Faith Issues Committee for the American Correctional Chaplains Association. I am also the Chaplaincy Liaison for the American Academy of Religion and serve on the National Advisory Council for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.</p>
<p>In every case, I have always done my best to shed a positive light on my community and to promote understanding and tolerance worldwide.</p>
<p>Now I have been offered the opportunity to represent us at an even higher level, and to do even more to promote ideals that many of us hold dear. World Peace, tolerance for diversity, the empowerment of women, the accommodation of pluralism, the sacredness of the earth and all of its inhabitants, and the conservation of our planetary environment and its resources.</p>
<p>I hope you will join me in making this happen by donating to my cause. Every little bit helps. And if you feel so inclined in the future, you can also make friends aware of my foundation and support its activities when you can. All donations are tax deductible.</p>
<p>Many Blessings,</p>

<h3>The Summary</h3>
<p>There aren't enough stories supporting and helping mothers, fathers and siblings in the tough times of pregnancy and raising a child. We want your help to share more stories of people’s lives in childbirth and raising children. These stories will help support anyone involved with children and hopefully put a smile on your face.</p>
<p>Our short story book is going to be compiled with over 20 (changed from 61) stories about having children and being pregnant. The stories are going to be funny, interesting, charming, courageous and sure to warm your heart. Since we use a crowd of readers to choose books, we want you to help choose the stories for our book, voting starts November 11th, on <a href=""http://apps.facebook.com/contestshq/contests/296775"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Choose the 61 stories"">Facebook</a>. You still have time to submit a story!<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/bookkus"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p>
<p>We hope to use this campaign to bring the 21 (Changed from 61 due to contest response) authors into the spotlight and get their work highlighted in the world. The book will help lift the spirits of pregnant women, siblings and new parents alike.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have estimated that publishing the book is going to cost about $2,500.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Copy editing, formatting, and the book cover is going to cost about $1,200.</li>
<li>The contest we are running to choose the stories will cost about $850.</li>
<li>Then the Indiegogo fees and funding the prizes takes up the other bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we don’t hit our maximum funding amount we are going to go ahead with the campaign and publish the book, but some of our plans are going to be downgraded in price. Our cover art will be lowered, our contest costs will be reduced, and copy-editing will be expedited. This means we will still have a really great book, but not as good as it could have been.</p>
<p>When you help us you get some of the awesomeness on the right hand side. Check it out. Mostly you get the book, but there are some other cool benefits there as well.</p>

<h3>Who am I &amp; why am I here?</h3>
<p>My name is Kit.  I'm a writer and an enthusiast of history and culture.  Unfortunately, I've never been out of the US, and have yet to really experience cultures other than my own.  To fix this little issue, I've decided to start with England.  I plan to go to England for three months to work for lodging and write about my experiences there.  I want to absorb culture and history, live in the moment, and share it with all of you.  With luck, I'll be able to self-publish my travel journal (whether in hard copy or ebook format) and give you all something to read about!</p>
<p>Writing is my passion and it is so difficult to write effectively and accurately while existing so close to my birth environment.  Help me branch out so that I can show you what a writer can do when given the chance to blossom!</p>
<p>I'll be tracking the IndieGoGo experience, as well as my travel preparations over at <a href=""https://workawayuk.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://workawayuk.wordpress.com</a> so stop by!</p>
<h3><strong>Other Writing Experience</strong></h3>
<p>I've run a blog over at <a href=""http://gogglesandlace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://gogglesandlace.com </a>for about two years now, and it's housed a lot of my personal goals, loves, rants, and fiction, as well as writing advice and encouragements for aspiring fiction writers.</p>
<p>I've competed in NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) four times, won twice, and wrangled an entire region of writers for two years as a Municipal Liaison.</p>
<p>With a close friend, I started Inkwell Imaginings, a group dedicated to helping writers refine their work and trash their fears about the process and their prose.  It's going on three years now, and has two chapters, one in MA and one in FL.  With those folks, my writing wouldn't have grown nearly as much as it has.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><em>What do I need?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Airfare</li>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Travel expenses</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I adore you all, whether you can contribute monetarily or not.  The fact that you're viewing this page right now means so much to me.  If you can relate to my wanderlust, have an interest in my travel-musings (or my fiction, which always gets better when I'm away from home *hinthint*), or just want to help, show me some love and spread the word about my campaign!  Share with your friends!</p>
</div></div>","Who am I & why am I here?
My name is Kit.  I'm a writer and an enthusiast of history and culture.  Unfortunately, I've never been out of the US, and have yet to really experience cultures other than my own.  To fix this little issue, I've decided to start with England.  I plan to go to England for three months to work for lodging and write about my experiences there.  I want to absorb culture and history, live in the moment, and share it with all of you.  With luck, I'll be able to self-publish my travel journal (whether in hard copy or ebook format) and give you all something to read about!
Writing is my passion and it is so difficult to write effectively and accurately while existing so close to my birth environment.  Help me branch out so that I can show you what a writer can do when given the chance to blossom!
I'll be tracking the IndieGoGo experience, as well as my travel preparations over at http://workawayuk.wordpress.com so stop by!
Other Writing Experience
I've run a blog over at http://gogglesandlace.com for about two years now, and it's housed a lot of my personal goals, loves, rants, and fiction, as well as writing advice and encouragements for aspiring fiction writers.
I've competed in NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) four times, won twice, and wrangled an entire region of writers for two years as a Municipal Liaison.
With a close friend, I started Inkwell Imaginings, a group dedicated to helping writers refine their work and trash their fears about the process and their prose.  It's going on three years now, and has two chapters, one in MA and one in FL.  With those folks, my writing wouldn't have grown nearly as much as it has.

</h3><p>We're setting our goal at the minimum $500 required by Indiegogo because we want to be able to get the books to you regardless of whether we get enough for all our expenses. What we actually need will depend on how many paperbacks are ordered, because they come with expenses that the ebooks don't. <br/></p><p>Our rough estimate, not including printing and postage costs for your orders, is $2200.<br/></p><p><b>The breakdown of our expenses:</b></p><p>Indiegogo fees are:<br/>PayPal - 4% if we reach our minimum $500 goal, or 9% if we don't.<br/>Credit card: An additional 3% on top of the PayPal amount.<br/>(So if you want your money to go further with us, pay by PayPal - they even let you pay by credit card without having an account).<br/></p><p>Each author in <i>Allusions of Innocence</i> is to be paid US$50. $50 x 18 authors = $900.</p><p>The estimated cost for paying <i>Amok</i> authors, and their contributor copies, is $650.<br/></p><p>Book cover design for <i>Amok</i> is NZ$220. The cover is illustrated by <a href=""http://junhunyap.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jun Hun Yap</a>, who was one of our artists featured in <i>Fae Fatales</i>.</p><p>Book cover design for <i>Allusions of Innocence</i> is US$150. The cover is designed by <a href=""http://www.carrionhouse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Luke Spooner</a>.<br/></p><p>The set-up fee with our printer (Lightning Source) is £42 per book, plus £21 for the cost of the proof version + postage.</p><p>Obviously, for print copies ordered, we have to cover the printing and postage costs out of what you give us, which means we'll only be making about $5 per book because we want to keep the cost to you down. It just means that we'll need to sell more than 200 paperbacks (or equivalent) to cover the expenses just for Allusions of Innocence if we're going to pay those authors.<br/></p><p>For promotional costs, we plan to give away at least one copy of each anthology on Goodreads. That will be printing and postage costs, to be determined by the printer.</p><p>If we do not reach our full goal, the funds we do receive will first go toward the authors in, and then further expenses for <i>Allusions of Innocence</i>, as Dominica Malcolm is able to cover the expenses for <i>Amok</i> herself. Joining this campaign is mostly for cross-promotional reasons.</p><p>If we manage to reach funding higher than we need, we will try to find some bonus perks for contributors. Any money left over will go toward the following:<br/>* Re-sending out packages of <i>Fae Fatales</i>, for those orders that were lost in the mail.<br/>* Marketing and promotional costs.<br/>* Funding toward a future anthology.<br/>* Set-up costs to move <i>Fae Fatales</i> to Lightning Source with the rest of our books.<br/></p><p></p><h3>What You Get</h3><b>Books</b><br/>We're offering, at various levels, both print and ebook copies of all of the books in our catalogue, but of course most prominently the ones we are currently funding for.<p></p><p>Aside from the anthologies listed above, the books we have available are:</p><p><i>Fae Fatales: A Fantasy Noir Anthology edited by Jax Goss</i><br/><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fantasy-noir-anthology/x/968017"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Details from our previous crowdfunding campaign</a><br/><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17800262-fae-fatales"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">On Goodreads</a><br/></p><p><i>Adrift by Dominica Malcolm</i><br/><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/adrift-a-novel-with-pirates-and-time-travel/x/968017"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Details from our previous crowdfunding campaign</a><br/><a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18168978-adrift"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">On Goodreads</a> - read the reviews!</p><p><b>T-shirts</b><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/404363/files/20140301235504-Dom_in_Amok_t-shirt.jpg?1393746904"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>(Dominica Malcolm modelling the <i>Amok</i> t-shirt; the design will differ slightly at the bottom as the colour will change for the text credit)<br/>We have a person in Malaysia printing t-shirts for the books.

Registered postage to other countries can be a little expensive, so it's US$25 for other locations.

<li>Genre (out of sci-fi, fantasy, mythology, dystopia, romance, memoir/creative non-fiction)<br/>

perceptions of it that exist. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Children see the world very differently to adults, which can
be frightening, or enlightening, or funny. When I picked the theme for this
anthology I had no idea just how wide this particular aspect could be.<br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I’ve always loved stories about smart children, kids who
were a bit more perceptive than their peers, children who were often outcasts
or sidelined despite (or maybe because) of their precocity. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">And so I created a brief that the stories should involve
these smart child protagonists, but be stories aimed at an adult audience.<br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I probably should have predicted how dark many of these
stories would go, but they ended up often being darker than I anticipated. Many
of these stories are not for the faint of heart. Some are downright disturbing.
Some are hopeful and funny. All of them are, in my not-so-humble opinion,
exceptional. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I hope you enjoy reading
them as much as I enjoyed compiling them. Welcome to the rabbit-hole.</span></p><p></p><p>A note from Dominica on <i>Amok</i>:<br/>My main reason for compiling a collection specific to the Asia-Pacific region is because I wanted to be part of the change to bring people greater diversity in terms of characters. I've been blogging for a while about diversity in the media, or lack thereof, and how I see its impact in the world. I think it's important for people of all backgrounds to be able to see people like themselves in stories, as well as those who are more often represented in the mainstream to be exposed to stories about people different from themselves. <i>Amok</i> represents a range of diverse characters, particularly in terms of race, but also in terms of age, ability, and sexuality.</p><p>My reason for focusing on the Asia-Pacific in particular is because it's one I'm most familiar with. I was born in Australia and lived there for the first 25 years of my life, and have since lived in Malaysia for the last 5. All of the countries included in the anthology, bar China, are actually places I've travelled and have various levels of knowledge. I'm also excited to be publishing Malaysians and Filipinos, amongst others with various ties to the region.<br/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you don't have the money to support us right now, here are some of the other things you can do to help:</p><ul>

They're already prepared at the printer, just waiting for your order!Jax Goss, the editor behind our inaugural book, Fae Fatales: A Fantasy Noir Anthology, has put together a collection of stories featuring precocious children, in an anthology called Allusions of Innocence.Dominica Malcolm, the author of our second book (and first novel), Adrift, has put together Amok: An Anthology of Asia-Pacific Speculative Fiction, which summarises itself.We're seeking funding to pay the authors in the first book (the authors in the second will be paid regardless of the result of this campaign), as well as production and promotion costs for both of them.About the BooksBoth books will be available in paperback and ebook formats. Ebook choices in the campaign may differ from what will be available afterwards. For example, though Amok will be available in the campaign in PDF, epub, and Kindle (mobi) formats, the editor plans to make it available exclusively on Amazon afterwards, to try out their KDP Select program.Allusions of Innocence
At approximately 75,000 words and 299 pages, this is a collection of 18 stories featuring precocious children characters. Many of them are very dark and twisted, but there are some funny, and sweet, and touching stories too. The stories, in book order, are:Mr. Harris' Door by A.P. SesslerWhite Hairs by Recle E. VibalThe Changing of the Seasons by Frida StavenowStep Right Up by Gerri LeenSummer's End by Meriah L. CrawfordThe Lying, the Snitch, and the Wardrobe by Steve WardReflections by James D.

What We Need
We're setting our goal at the minimum $500 required by Indiegogo because we want to be able to get the books to you regardless of whether we get enough for all our expenses. What we actually need will depend on how many paperbacks are ordered, because they come with expenses that the ebooks don't. Our rough estimate, not including printing and postage costs for your orders, is $2200.The breakdown of our expenses:Indiegogo fees are:PayPal - 4% if we reach our minimum $500 goal, or 9% if we don't.Credit card: An additional 3% on top of the PayPal amount.(So if you want your money to go further with us, pay by PayPal - they even let you pay by credit card without having an account).Each author in Allusions of Innocence is to be paid US$50. $50 x 18 authors = $900.The estimated cost for paying Amok authors, and their contributor copies, is $650.Book cover design for Amok is NZ$220. The cover is illustrated by Jun Hun Yap, who was one of our artists featured in Fae Fatales.Book cover design for Allusions of Innocence is US$150. The cover is designed by Luke Spooner.The set-up fee with our printer (Lightning Source) is £42 per book, plus £21 for the cost of the proof version + postage.Obviously, for print copies ordered, we have to cover the printing and postage costs out of what you give us, which means we'll only be making about $5 per book because we want to keep the cost to you down. It just means that we'll need to sell more than 200 paperbacks (or equivalent) to cover the expenses just for Allusions of Innocence if we're going to pay those authors.For promotional costs, we plan to give away at least one copy of each anthology on Goodreads. That will be printing and postage costs, to be determined by the printer.If we do not reach our full goal, the funds we do receive will first go toward the authors in, and then further expenses for Allusions of Innocence, as Dominica Malcolm is able to cover the expenses for Amok herself. Joining this campaign is mostly for cross-promotional reasons.If we manage to reach funding higher than we need, we will try to find some bonus perks for contributors. Any money left over will go toward the following:* Re-sending out packages of Fae Fatales, for those orders that were lost in the mail.* Marketing and promotional costs.* Funding toward a future anthology.* Set-up costs to move Fae Fatales to Lightning Source with the rest of our books.What You GetBooksWe're offering, at various levels, both print and ebook copies of all of the books in our catalogue, but of course most prominently the ones we are currently funding for.Aside from the anthologies listed above, the books we have available are:Fae Fatales: A Fantasy Noir Anthology edited by Jax GossDetails from our previous crowdfunding campaignOn GoodreadsAdrift by Dominica MalcolmDetails from our previous crowdfunding campaignOn Goodreads - read the reviews!T-shirts(Dominica Malcolm modelling the Amok t-shirt; the design will differ slightly at the bottom as the colour will change for the text credit)We have a person in Malaysia printing t-shirts for the books. If you're local to Kuala Lumpur and can arrange to pick up a t-shirt from Dominica, you can get one for US$16. Registered postage to other countries can be a little expensive, so it's US$25 for other locations. The Amok t-shirt includes a royalty payment to the artist.You can have a choice of colour for the t-shirt, and the sizes available are from S to XXL.StoriesIf you'd like to contribute more, the editors are also offering a limited number of stories written specifically for you, which we will then collate into an ebook, which you will also receive. Your story will be dedicated to you in the ebook. Jax and Dominica will choose between the prompts you provide, which can be up to two of the following:
Character name
Prompt word/phrase
Title

Genre (out of sci-fi, fantasy, mythology, dystopia, romance, memoir/creative non-fiction)

You can also order more than one perk, by going through the process. If you would like to order multiple copies of the same perk, then please scroll down to the end of this page to find out how to do that, because we can give you a discount, we just don't have the space to offer them all as options in the perks.The ImpactA note from Jax on Allusions of Innocence:I have long been fascinated by childhood, and the various
perceptions of it that exist. Children see the world very differently to adults, which can
be frightening, or enlightening, or funny. When I picked the theme for this
anthology I had no idea just how wide this particular aspect could be.I’ve always loved stories about smart children, kids who
were a bit more perceptive than their peers, children who were often outcasts
or sidelined despite (or maybe because) of their precocity. And so I created a brief that the stories should involve
these smart child protagonists, but be stories aimed at an adult audience.I probably should have predicted how dark many of these
stories would go, but they ended up often being darker than I anticipated. Many
of these stories are not for the faint of heart. Some are downright disturbing.
Some are hopeful and funny. All of them are, in my not-so-humble opinion,
exceptional. I hope you enjoy reading
them as much as I enjoyed compiling them. Welcome to the rabbit-hole.A note from Dominica on Amok:My main reason for compiling a collection specific to the Asia-Pacific region is because I wanted to be part of the change to bring people greater diversity in terms of characters. I've been blogging for a while about diversity in the media, or lack thereof, and how I see its impact in the world. I think it's important for people of all backgrounds to be able to see people like themselves in stories, as well as those who are more often represented in the mainstream to be exposed to stories about people different from themselves. Amok represents a range of diverse characters, particularly in terms of race, but also in terms of age, ability, and sexuality.My reason for focusing on the Asia-Pacific in particular is because it's one I'm most familiar with. I was born in Australia and lived there for the first 25 years of my life, and have since lived in Malaysia for the last 5. All of the countries included in the anthology, bar China, are actually places I've travelled and have various levels of knowledge. I'm also excited to be publishing Malaysians and Filipinos, amongst others with various ties to the region.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you don't have the money to support us right now, here are some of the other things you can do to help:

<p> 
 In uncovering, dislodging and
revealing the “hush-hush” of secrets, layer upon layer of mystery is revealed.
One door opens and then another and another. The secrecy of heritage includes
my forebears who owned land, substantial acreage, beginning in the 1880s, when
black people in Louisiana were doing their damndest  to beat back the crushing reality of the
United States’ abandonment of hard won freedoms of the Emancipation
Proclamation . The United States Constitution had failed them. The nine-year
window of Reconstruction was shuttered, nail driven, shot through. Black people
were alone, once again, without recourse against those who had fought just as
hard to keep them on the other side of freedom. </p>
<p> 
My name is C. Rosalind Bell. I am a writer living in Tacoma, Washington.
I was born in Louisiana, and grew up thirty miles north of the Gulf of
Mexico.  </p>
<p> 
For me to tell this story, the parts I know for sure and the parts
founded in discovery, for me to do it justice I have to commit first an act of
betrayal against the two people I knew and loved most in the whole, wide world.
Betrayal of the two people who loved me more than anybody had a right to be
loved; my parents.</p>
<p> 
I have had it with me from a long time now, this story. This story
requiring betrayal. Carried it with me in my dreams and night sweats.</p>
<p> 
The many doors of the story all begin with an index finger pressed
against pursed  and worried lips; “a
secret.” And that secret, the cause of the “hush-hush” was me.</p>
<p>The “A” word. Adoption. A word
never spoken in our house. It did not exist; the concept, the notion. I
belonged to the two people in the living room, in the kitchen,  in the Buick, in the hospital over nights
when my tonsils had to go, taking me to piano lessons or to Brouses’ Toy Land,
and that was the end of the story. 
Inquiry into my origins was not on the table. I began and ended with
them.  They wanted the best for me and
above all else they wanted to protect me from any and all harm. </p>
<p> 
1954 The couple enter their solidly middle class home with their 5
month-old baby girl. She is wrapped up in their dreams.  They fumble with the newness of this
wide-eyed creature; giddy in the love they are pouring all over her and
themselves. Her father scrapes the red dust of West Feliciana Parish country
roads from his Pontiac. They have made it home.</p>

<h3>STRETCH GOAL #1</h3>
<p>If we're able to raise €5,500 then we'll be able to create a professional audiobook, read by the author, and offer that to everyone who contributes to the campaign. So everyone will get a printed book, as well as digital and audio books!</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503486464/xhq9drsahgvpemrwlrvs.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>Short Summary<br/> </h3>
<p>I'm Ryan Millar, a 20-year improv veteran – as a student, performer, teacher, and workshop leader. As it happens, I'm also a professional writer. So I combined those pursuits by writing this book about improv. It contains a bunch of the ideas and insights I've collected over those two decades – especially the ones that resonated most with workshop participants.</p>
<p>It also has some first-person anecdotes as well as an assortment of games and exercises I've learned or created. My goal was to create a book that people could read cover to cover, or to pick up whenever they need a little inspiration or are feeling stuck. </p>
<p>This book has taken years to write. Once that was done, it went through a rigorous editing, feedback and rewriting process. It's now being professionally proofread (Oxford comma or not?) and will then be laid out by the wonderful designer Eva Carp. I've even assembled a team of wonderful and supportive folks to help me see this through. So all the elements are in place.</p>
<p>All I need to know is how many copies to print.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503088452/tcb9npw30emz5t63ydw9.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Production &amp; Timeline<br/> </h3>
<p>As soon as the campaign is over, and the designs are finalized, I'll place an order with a local independent book printer in Amsterdam called Pantheon Drukwerk. It should take two weeks from that date until the books are ready to be shipped.</p>
<p>Then when the boxes of books arrive in our living room, the delivery team will put them in envelopes and mail them to you. The campaign has a few different perks, in case you want to spice up your order.</p>
<p>Because the project is ready to go, shipping is scheduled for early November.</p>
<p>The overall goal for this campaign is €4000. Which works out to 400 copies of the book. 400 copies, that's the magic number.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503088056/fsu8zvhuebwzrnrl5p9y.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Why 400 copies? <br/> </h3>
<p>If I presell 400 copies via this campaign, I'll be able to afford to print 500 copies of the book, so I can have 100 extra copies to take to festivals, workshops and shows.</p>
<p>And those 400 copies (or €4,000) will allow me to</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay the proofreader, editors, and designer (somewhat close to what they're worth)</li>
<li>Get an ISBN (so the book can eventually be sold on Amazon)</li>
<li>Pay for the various perks, like bookmarks, stickers and bags</li>
<li>Incidentals, like envelopes, printer ink, etc.</li>
<li>Break even on printing costs and all of the above</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In terms of getting my work out there, having 400 copies of my improv ideas sent out to improvisers and other interested parties around the world would be enormously satisfying</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 2</strong>: Apparently, the average independently published book sells 250 copies over its lifetime. My goal is to beat that number (and just shooting for 300 copies seemed a little <i>under</i>ambitious). Hence the magic 400.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 3</strong>: If the campaign falls short of our funding goal, but is close enough that I don't lose too much money on the printing, then it's still on!</p>
<p>If the campaign falls way short of that, the book won't get printed. And I'll also be miserable. Not permanently, but for a good while.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Why I'm doing this<br/> </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>FOR ME: </strong>Teaching improv workshops is a great passion of mine because they're fun, people find them useful and challenging, I give insightful notes, and I've picked up a lot of tips and experience in my travels – I love to pass that stuff on. But these days I don't go to festivals or shows as often as I used to, so this book is a chance to spread those teachings.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>FOR YOU:</strong> You'll get a beautiful physical book full of great insights that you can immediately apply to your improv practice. You'll also be supporting a self-generated arts and media project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the two main impacts, and there's another one:</p>
<ul><li>I'll be a (self-)published author, which is another dream of mine. I win, you win, improv wins.  So. Many. Wins.</li></ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/> </h3>
<p>The biggest risk in this is that after pouring in all this hard work in order to get this book written, rewritten, rewritten, chopped, edited, changed and finally sorted (turns out writing and independently publishing a book is A LOT of work), I'm not able to get it printed, and thus fall short of the goal.</p>
<p>But if the campaign is successful there will be the organizational challenge of sorting, labeling and mailing 400 books. Luckily my wife Chiara, who is a master organizer, has volunteered to help with this. </p>
<p>I've also got a small team here in Amsterdam to help me with the boxing, mailing, and moral support. So the biggest challenge at the moment is that it just doesn't get finished. I hate to leave things unfinished.</p>
<p>Order a copy and I get to fulfill this goal. And you get a book!</p>

</ul></div>","STRETCH GOAL #1
If we're able to raise €5,500 then we'll be able to create a professional audiobook, read by the author, and offer that to everyone who contributes to the campaign. So everyone will get a printed book, as well as digital and audio books!

Short Summary 
I'm Ryan Millar, a 20-year improv veteran – as a student, performer, teacher, and workshop leader. As it happens, I'm also a professional writer. So I combined those pursuits by writing this book about improv. It contains a bunch of the ideas and insights I've collected over those two decades – especially the ones that resonated most with workshop participants.
It also has some first-person anecdotes as well as an assortment of games and exercises I've learned or created. My goal was to create a book that people could read cover to cover, or to pick up whenever they need a little inspiration or are feeling stuck. 
This book has taken years to write. Once that was done, it went through a rigorous editing, feedback and rewriting process. It's now being professionally proofread (Oxford comma or not?) and will then be laid out by the wonderful designer Eva Carp. I've even assembled a team of wonderful and supportive folks to help me see this through. So all the elements are in place.
All I need to know is how many copies to print.


Production & Timeline 
As soon as the campaign is over, and the designs are finalized, I'll place an order with a local independent book printer in Amsterdam called Pantheon Drukwerk. It should take two weeks from that date until the books are ready to be shipped.
Then when the boxes of books arrive in our living room, the delivery team will put them in envelopes and mail them to you. The campaign has a few different perks, in case you want to spice up your order.
Because the project is ready to go, shipping is scheduled for early November.
The overall goal for this campaign is €4000. Which works out to 400 copies of the book. 400 copies, that's the magic number.

Why 400 copies?  
If I presell 400 copies via this campaign, I'll be able to afford to print 500 copies of the book, so I can have 100 extra copies to take to festivals, workshops and shows.
And those 400 copies (or €4,000) will allow me to

Pay the proofreader, editors, and designer (somewhat close to what they're worth)
Get an ISBN (so the book can eventually be sold on Amazon)
Pay for the various perks, like bookmarks, stickers and bags
Incidentals, like envelopes, printer ink, etc.
Break even on printing costs and all of the above

NOTE: In terms of getting my work out there, having 400 copies of my improv ideas sent out to improvisers and other interested parties around the world would be enormously satisfying
NOTE 2: Apparently, the average independently published book sells 250 copies over its lifetime. My goal is to beat that number (and just shooting for 300 copies seemed a little underambitious). Hence the magic 400.
NOTE 3: If the campaign falls short of our funding goal, but is close enough that I don't lose too much money on the printing, then it's still on!
If the campaign falls way short of that, the book won't get printed. And I'll also be miserable. Not permanently, but for a good while.


Why I'm doing this 


FOR ME: Teaching improv workshops is a great passion of mine because they're fun, people find them useful and challenging, I give insightful notes, and I've picked up a lot of tips and experience in my travels – I love to pass that stuff on. But these days I don't go to festivals or shows as often as I used to, so this book is a chance to spread those teachings. 

FOR YOU: You'll get a beautiful physical book full of great insights that you can immediately apply to your improv practice. You'll also be supporting a self-generated arts and media project.

Those are the two main impacts, and there's another one:
I'll be a (self-)published author, which is another dream of mine. I win, you win, improv wins.  So. Many. Wins.


Risks & Challenges 
The biggest risk in this is that after pouring in all this hard work in order to get this book written, rewritten, rewritten, chopped, edited, changed and finally sorted (turns out writing and independently publishing a book is A LOT of work), I'm not able to get it printed, and thus fall short of the goal.
But if the campaign is successful there will be the organizational challenge of sorting, labeling and mailing 400 books. Luckily my wife Chiara, who is a master organizer, has volunteered to help with this. 
I've also got a small team here in Amsterdam to help me with the boxing, mailing, and moral support. So the biggest challenge at the moment is that it just doesn't get finished. I hate to leave things unfinished.
Order a copy and I get to fulfill this goal. And you get a book!


Other Ways You Can Help 
The cheapest perk is a reasonable €10 plus shipping. But if that doesn't suit you, no problem. You can still help!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hi. I wrote a book. It's chock-full of revenge and sapphic fun. You need more of that in your life. Let's make this happen, shall we?</span></h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">~</p><h4>Last November, I participated in NaNoWriMo.</h4><p>That's something I've done every year for several now: prepare a deep cup of chai and/or other tea, hunch over my laptop, and start pounding away at the keys. From November 1st to November 30th, I write like a demon. It doesn't always yield fantastic results, but it always yields... results, at least. Either way, it keeps me off the streets.</p><p>This past Autumn, I think I hit on something good. Something not only of quality, but that will resonate with a lot of my people (by ""my people"", I mean many things: biracial people, WLW, nerds, geeks, feminists, and avid readers of supernatural fiction).  It turned out a lot better than I expected, and I think it's ready to be consumed. </p><p>To be blunt, both with you and with myself, I've been sitting on this far longer than I should have. Several things gave me the swift kick in the glutes that I needed. My birthday reminding me that I'm another year older. The Orlando shooting reminding me that there are no guarantees you get another day to pursue your dream — especially when you're not a white straight cismale. Add onto those the wealth of other projects I want to start, and it seems the time has come to get this one out there for other people to enjoy and stop hoarding it to myself.</p><h4>About ""Bleeding For Eurydice""</h4><p>Without giving too much away, this book is a dramedy/romance/supernatural story. More inspired by <i>Dresden Files</i> and <i>Buffy </i>than anything else as far as the supernatural aspects go, but I tend to weave a little of everything I've ever consumed into my work. I tried to represent a few different cultures and mindsets all throughout, keeping the focus on entertainment value even while sociopolitical issues are being dissected under the surface. I'd say it's a friendship-and-romance story foremost, a supernatural tale of revenge second, and <i>then </i>a piece of feminist literature. But it doesn't really work without all of those elements together, and you can't take one out without upsetting the balance.</p><p>General rating is a soft R, maybe a PG-13 from the late 70s. There's a lot of swearing and period talk, frank discussions about sex and nudity, a tiny bit of violence, blood. Plus some body horror moments that might leave some feeling a little squeamish. Not much in the way of ""bedroom gymnastics"", but that does come up. Basically, it's nowhere near <i>Fifty Shades, </i>but please don't read this as a bedtime story to small children!</p><p>Yes, it does have something to do with the Greek tale of Eurydice (yoo-RID-eh-SEE). No, I'm not going to tell you exactly how — but you can read and find out! (Apologies if that comes across as mean)</p><p>How much book are you getting for your money? In length, it clocks in at over <strike>117,000</strike> <i>119,000</i> words. For those of you who aren't writers and would have no reason to memorise word counts, that means it's longer than <i>Frankenstein</i>, the third Harry Potter book or <i>The Hobbit</i>, just a hair longer than <i>Twilight</i>. So if you were worried about getting a thinnish YA novel that will only take you an hour or two to consume, worry no longer! Also, definitely nowhere near as lengthy as <i>Moby Dick</i> or <i>Fellowship Of The Ring</i> if you balk at long-term commitments. I didn't pad it with filler, nor did I trim out things where trimming was not needed.</p><h4>Where You Come In</h4><p>This Indiegogo is your chance to buy this book before it's widely available to the public on Amazon.com (EDIT: This <i>will</i> include an eBook option at that time, for those of you wondering). Take note that it will be marginally less expensive on there, but also won't be signed, and won't have any of the other perks available to you through this campaign. So if you're patient and don't care about autographs and such things, then rest assured, you will have another way to get the book! </p><p>Once the Indiegogo campaign ends, I will continue to offer the basic perk of an autographed copy at an increased price, and the other perks will go away. So if you want drawings, or a copy autographed by the illustrator or any of the other goodies, you'd better stop stalling!</p><p>Now I realise that I'm more or less an untested and unknown author, and you may feel there's no incentive to fund this campaign now. No arguing with that. However, if the premise and/or aspects of this type of story appeal to you, I thought this would be an ideal way to provide more than just the book itself, and to get it to you a little earlier.</p><p>What I'm offering:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The opportunity to snag a trade-sized paperback of ""Bleeding For Eurydice"" before anyone else — and autographed.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Related rewards, such as getting your name in the book, t-shirts, or bonus drawings by <a href=""http://lauraknatt.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laura Knatt</a>, the cover artist.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">UNrelated rewards, such as me slipping in a random Pokémon card into your book. Just because.</span><br/>
</li>

I can't know the future so I don't want to lock down a date, especially since if I get a better response than expected, it could take me a while to sign all those copies.

<p>Some people feel more comfortable ""donating"" to a cause wherein they know the recipient is in desperate need of funds, for a life-saving operation or to pay rent or what have you.

I'd love to replace my technically-running laptop with a newer desktop that has more power (which will enable me to actually play my Steam games again, since that has been a pipe dream of late). There are other health-related and life-related needs I am less comfortable discussing, but they aren't urgent and I'll be fine for the time being.</p>
<p>As the title of this section states, I'm not poor, but I'm <i>definitely </i>not rich. Rest assured I won't be splurging on any gold toilet seats with your money; I'll be buying food and saving toward a reasonably-cheap car, or a PC I hope to last me several years. </p>
<h4>That's It!</h4>
<p>Take a look through the perks I'm offering and decide if any of those sound worthwhile to you. If you fund me, thanks! If not... thanks for reading this far! Maybe you can pass the page on to a friend who you think will be a little more interested, or you'll pick the book up when it's available on Amazon.

</div></div>","Hi. I wrote a book. It's chock-full of revenge and sapphic fun. You need more of that in your life. Let's make this happen, shall we?~Last November, I participated in NaNoWriMo.That's something I've done every year for several now: prepare a deep cup of chai and/or other tea, hunch over my laptop, and start pounding away at the keys. From November 1st to November 30th, I write like a demon. It doesn't always yield fantastic results, but it always yields... results, at least. Either way, it keeps me off the streets.This past Autumn, I think I hit on something good. Something not only of quality, but that will resonate with a lot of my people (by ""my people"", I mean many things: biracial people, WLW, nerds, geeks, feminists, and avid readers of supernatural fiction).  It turned out a lot better than I expected, and I think it's ready to be consumed. To be blunt, both with you and with myself, I've been sitting on this far longer than I should have. Several things gave me the swift kick in the glutes that I needed. My birthday reminding me that I'm another year older. The Orlando shooting reminding me that there are no guarantees you get another day to pursue your dream — especially when you're not a white straight cismale. Add onto those the wealth of other projects I want to start, and it seems the time has come to get this one out there for other people to enjoy and stop hoarding it to myself.About ""Bleeding For Eurydice""Without giving too much away, this book is a dramedy/romance/supernatural story. More inspired by Dresden Files and Buffy than anything else as far as the supernatural aspects go, but I tend to weave a little of everything I've ever consumed into my work. I tried to represent a few different cultures and mindsets all throughout, keeping the focus on entertainment value even while sociopolitical issues are being dissected under the surface. I'd say it's a friendship-and-romance story foremost, a supernatural tale of revenge second, and then a piece of feminist literature. But it doesn't really work without all of those elements together, and you can't take one out without upsetting the balance.General rating is a soft R, maybe a PG-13 from the late 70s. There's a lot of swearing and period talk, frank discussions about sex and nudity, a tiny bit of violence, blood. Plus some body horror moments that might leave some feeling a little squeamish. Not much in the way of ""bedroom gymnastics"", but that does come up. Basically, it's nowhere near Fifty Shades, but please don't read this as a bedtime story to small children!Yes, it does have something to do with the Greek tale of Eurydice (yoo-RID-eh-SEE). No, I'm not going to tell you exactly how — but you can read and find out! (Apologies if that comes across as mean)How much book are you getting for your money? In length, it clocks in at over 117,000 119,000 words. For those of you who aren't writers and would have no reason to memorise word counts, that means it's longer than Frankenstein, the third Harry Potter book or The Hobbit, just a hair longer than Twilight. So if you were worried about getting a thinnish YA novel that will only take you an hour or two to consume, worry no longer! Also, definitely nowhere near as lengthy as Moby Dick or Fellowship Of The Ring if you balk at long-term commitments. I didn't pad it with filler, nor did I trim out things where trimming was not needed.Where You Come InThis Indiegogo is your chance to buy this book before it's widely available to the public on Amazon.com (EDIT: This will include an eBook option at that time, for those of you wondering). Take note that it will be marginally less expensive on there, but also won't be signed, and won't have any of the other perks available to you through this campaign. So if you're patient and don't care about autographs and such things, then rest assured, you will have another way to get the book! Once the Indiegogo campaign ends, I will continue to offer the basic perk of an autographed copy at an increased price, and the other perks will go away. So if you want drawings, or a copy autographed by the illustrator or any of the other goodies, you'd better stop stalling!Now I realise that I'm more or less an untested and unknown author, and you may feel there's no incentive to fund this campaign now. No arguing with that. However, if the premise and/or aspects of this type of story appeal to you, I thought this would be an ideal way to provide more than just the book itself, and to get it to you a little earlier.What I'm offering:

The opportunity to snag a trade-sized paperback of ""Bleeding For Eurydice"" before anyone else — and autographed.


Related rewards, such as getting your name in the book, t-shirts, or bonus drawings by Laura Knatt, the cover artist.


UNrelated rewards, such as me slipping in a random Pokémon card into your book. Just because.

To be clear: the near-final draft of the manuscript and cover art are complete. All that's left at the time of this campaign launch is a final editing overview and the ordering of a few proof copies to make sure it looks exactly the way I want it to look (plus adding the list of Indiegogo backers to the book, which I won't have until the campaign ends). I can't know the future so I don't want to lock down a date, especially since if I get a better response than expected, it could take me a while to sign all those copies. But rest assured that I project fulfilling every single order within the next few months. In time for Christmas!
NOTICE: ALL SALES FINAL. If you have a complaint, we will work with you to make it right, up to and including replacement of the merchandise if it is deemed necessary, but cannot refund your money. I'm not Walmart and I can't very easily ""eat the losses"".

ANOTHER NOTICE: All of the perks include US shipping. I realise now that I shouldn't have done it that way, because most people in the US expect the price to be the base price, and then shipping added on afterward. But too many rewards have been claimed for me to change it now, haha.
STRETCH GOALS
Uhh... really, the story is done, the art is done; there isn't anything to ""stretch"" for besides that, haha. However...






If we hit the $500 minimum goal, I'll consider making a hardcover version available. This would be added as an entirely separate perk, and I'd have to figure out pricing first. OKAY COOL! Wow, I'm honestly shocked that we hit this one so fast; in the first 12 hours! Update: there's a Hardcover perk available now! Check the campaign updates for details.


Maybe if we get over $2000, I'll find someone to record an audiobook? I wouldn't even know how to go about that, but I'm a smart cookie; I can do some research and get it done.


I'm Not Poor But I'm Not Rich
Some people feel more comfortable ""donating"" to a cause wherein they know the recipient is in desperate need of funds, for a life-saving operation or to pay rent or what have you. I'm not currently in a situation that dire; if your money is better placed with one of those people, then please give to them first!

There are other health-related and life-related needs I am less comfortable discussing, but they aren't urgent and I'll be fine for the time being.

<p>eSpec Books is making magic! Five books have funded: Megan Mackie's <i><strong>The Devil's Day</strong></i> and <i><strong>Lucky Devil Libations</strong></i>, Michelle D. Sonnier's <i><strong>An Unceasing Hunger</strong></i>, Ty Drago's <strong><i>Dragons</i></strong>, and the upcoming anthology <i><strong>Horns and Halos</strong></i>.</p>
<p><strong>The Devil's Day</strong> by Megan Mackie<br/>(book 3 in the Lucky Devil series)</p>
<p>You can always find help at the Lucky Devil.</p>
<p>Rune Leveau—emerging Talent and one-time corporate prisoner—knew that better than anyone. She’d rebuilt her life at the Lucky Devil bar, with her Aunt Maddie’s help. Now, in her aunt’s memory, Rune continues that legacy.</p>
<p>But when it is time for the Devil to collect his due, Rune could lose it all…</p>
<p>With the days counting down until she must defend her claim to the House of Magdalene—including the bar—Rune and her partner, the cyber-spy St. Benedict, hunt for a way to defeat her challenger, the fire Talent, Abraxas. Instead, they uncover long-kept secrets. But do they hold the key?</p>
<p>No matter what, the Devil will have its Day…</p>
<p><strong><i>Lucky Devil Libations</i></strong> by Megan Mackie and Olivia Kizior</p>
<p>An exclusive companion book to the author's series, featuring recipes for drinks and bar food unique to the Lucky Devil, as well as short vignettes featuring the patrons of the bar.</p>
<p><strong><i>An Unceasing Hunger</i></strong> by Michelle D. Sonnier<br/>(book 2 in the Evolution of Magic series, and sequel to <i>The Clockwork Witch</i>)</p>
<p>Shunned by her family her entire life for not living up to their expectations—or prophesy—Arabella forges her own path and attains her greatest wish: to join the Sisterhood of Witches. Doing so in a manner no one ever anticipated.</p>
<p>As the first-ever technomancer, the way before her is fraught with peril. Can she survive the machinations of her order, or be ground between the gears of reluctant progress?</p>
<p>More important yet, can she succeed at her first assignment:  find the root cause of the famine sweeping through Ireland? A task that already claimed two witches of the Sortilege line.</p>
<p>Her future hangs in the balance... or her very life....</p>
<p><strong><i>Dragons</i></strong> by Ty Drago</p>

<p>For one young man and others of his Kind, they are taught their very existence is a long-held secret. Andy learns unexpectedly that it isn't a very well kept one.  </p>
<p>The race of Dragons is not what the wider world would expect, but the elite are well—if not fully—versed in what they are capable of. One ruthless faction is not above kidnapping Andy and whisking him across the universe to exploit his unique nature. </p>

<p>All of that business stuff aside, we are creating magic, and right now the world needs more of that. Original fiction, original ideas, positivity and overcoming adversity.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>My name is Marina Destinee Paul and I am the author of <i>Becoming a Superhero</i>. I wrote this book out of necessity because I didn’t know how to find a female mentor who I saw myself in. I wanted to know what made women successful, beyond a transactional leadership assessment, and dive deep into who they were as humans. When I discovered the essence of these women, apart from their formal role title, the only name that was fit to describe them was “Superhero.""<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how you can become a leader in your life and elevate the lives of others . This book is an opportunity to help you understand leadership is rooted in owning your unique skillset and mind, and using it to help others believe in their own unique ability. My hope is for you to learn alongside local, national, and internationally-known Superheroes, like Entrepreneur Dr. Kristian Edwards, Fortune 50 General Counsel Maryanne Lavan, and Olympic Gold Medalist Jordyn Wieber. I want you to leave this book understanding the importance of practicing resilience every day, building deep relationships with individuals, and not being afraid to “go for it” - whatever “it” means in your life.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are embarking on your professional career, are transitioning into a new chapter of your life, or are yearning for something more that will ignite your passions. This book is the toolkit to finding your superpowers and the pep talk to use them.<br/><br/><i>Becoming a Superhero</i> appeals to women of all ages, no matter which phase of life they are currently in. They may be grappling with living in a ""man's world"", or feeling the weight of the preconceived world around them is not their destiny. They are gaining the confidence to break the status quo, hone in on their power, and ignite the world.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Becoming a Superhero</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How do I unleash the superhero within me?</li>
<li>How do I make sure everyone on my team is seen and heard?</li>
<li>How can the power of sisterhood help solve racial justice?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing vulnerability, humility and failure, as well as leaving people better than we found them will change us all for the better.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Marina Paul is a management consultant, marketer, and former collegiate athlete.<br/><br/>Her passion is to unite women of all backgrounds, and establish a connection where we see one another for who we uniquely are. With a lifetime of experiences being on sports teams, Marina knows how sisterhood-like bonds -- whether it is big sister, twin, or little sister — can transform lives for the better. She uses her own life experiences through sports, coupled with one-on-one interviews with incredibly successful women, to characterize an intensely raw and emotional path to leadership and being a Superhero.<br/><br/>Marina can’t sit still and always has to be doing something active — snowboarding, beach volleyball, soccer, yoga, trail running, attending a sporting event, or bouncing around a major city. She is someone who deeply cherishes her friends and honors loyalty, and is equally content being in a foreign city alone meeting new people. She lives for the adventure and excitement of what is unknown and the beauty of life she can uncover.<br/><br/>She’s taking her own book’s advice and finding one challenging or humiliating thing a week that she knows she might fail at, laughing at herself, and learning in the process.<br/><br/>Share your personal weekly challenge with Marina on social media! <strong>For more information, connect with Marina Paul:​</strong><br/><strong>Email</strong>: marinadpaul@gmail.com<br/><strong>Instagram</strong>: @marinapaul<br/><strong>Twitter</strong>: @marinadpaul<br/><strong>LinkedIn</strong>: @Marina Paul</p>

</div></div>","Places I Have Been Rejected From Have Accepted Me. Help me say ""Yes, I will attend"" to Bread Loaf & Byrdcliffe Artist Colony on the east coast. The life of a writer is riddled with
rejection, but for some reason, this year, two wonderful things have been offered and I humbly ask for your help so that I may accept both opportunities to write, live and complete my next body of work. I'm going to channel my spirit animal, Amanda Palmer and ask for your help in sending me to the East Coast for both things. This campaign is a stepping stone. 

#1. I have been accepted to Bread Loaf Writers Fellowship. What the hell is that? It's a 10-day workshop where I will have the chance to be critiqued and throttled by my peers and guided by my illustrious and hopefully kind workshop leader at Middlebury College in Ripton, Vermont. I've been accepted into their prestigious nonfiction program and I have submitted scary new work. I have sent in my $300 deposit. Now they want the rest of the money for room, board and tuition.    



#2. I was chosen as an Artist-In-Residency at Byrdcliffe Art Colony for session IV: From September 2-September 28th where I will write in this crazy cottage/barn from 1901 on like 250 acres in the Catskill Mountains just west of the Hudson River where Isadora Duncan used to dance and where Chevy Chase used to live and Wallace Stevens and Thomas Dewey and other famous writers with similar last names have also worked. A reliable source has reported a ghost named Jane who bosses around writers and makes them produce every day. Between Jane, the wolf spiders and the foxes, I will batten down the hatches and hide in my dark chamber and write.  


I realize that making art and attending fancy
pants workshops which feature hiking trails and cottages and Amtrak sound like frivolous things, especially when
people are fighting cancer, losing their homes, losing loved ones, suffering in general, being beaten by cops or being drugged by Bill
Cosby. But if I can take a little time off of my gazillion jobs to finish my second
book, it would be a step in the right direction—away from stripping and towards the writing. 
I know I only get to do this once. 
I believe in writing as literature and writing as art. Because these two are connected, I must do both in order to have a full life. I have no husband with which to share my expenses. I rent. I live alone. And I've chosen to strip in order to carve out blocks of time for writing, but now the time has come to embark on a radical life change: a full-time job and a life of writing and teaching.
Writing a book-length manuscript demands a very different thing than writing for a couple hours each day. I need a quiet and deep stretch of time where I must get down on the dusty floor and write like a motherfucker. 

I'm asking you to send me away from Los Angeles—from the things and people I love the most. Help me leave my gazillion gigs, my high maintenance animals and my wonderful, supportive boyfriend in order to do this thing that I have to do in order to enter a new phase of my creative life. 
I am asking strictly for tuition, travel and housing expenses to both Bread Loaf and Byrdcliffe Art Colony
 Here is the breakdown of where the money is going:  My rent for September: $1,083.00 (I cannot AirBnB because I am not on the lease and the manager lives upstairs).

<h2>Hi. I'm Henry Reade.</h2>
<p>When I was younger I had a hard time finding books I liked. What was available tended to be what adults thought I should read, not what my friends and I wanted to read. So I spent 5 years writing a series of humorous, irreverent books called The Pencil Bandits, about three brothers who try to become outlaws. I tested them, and discovered that kids loved them, and that these books got kids excited about reading. I now want to publish my second Pencil Bandits book, but I need your help. Please support my campaign to get more young people reading by giving them books that they find fun. Because who knows more about what young people want to read than a genuine young person? </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Hey guys! My name is Patrick Noll and I am the author of the book TRICHOCEREUS: THE SAN PEDRO GROUP which we successfully financed through Indiegogo in 2016. Because of the incredible support of our community we were able to surpass all expectations BY FAR and delivered a wonderful hardcover book that is now in the hands of hundreds of happy owners! <strong>And now we´re back with the second volume called TRICHOCEREUS: SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS.</strong></p>
<p>SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS will be a coffee table sized book (A4) with countless photos and descriptions of Trichocereus hybrids, clones and cultivars from all over the world. It contains hundreds of unique photos and information on a large number of Trichocereus clones, hybrids and cultivars. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Book Highlights</u></h2>
<ul>
<li>All books are extremely limited, hand numbered and personally signed by the author. It´s our way of expressing our gratitude towards our supporters and every single book will be signed. </li>
<li>Extra large A4 coffee table type book with hundreds of photos</li>
<li>All color pages. This isn´t one of the books that is mostly black and white and only has a few color pics in the back. Pretty much all pages are in color and most of them have photos. </li>
<li>Written in English, Self Published and not available in book stores. </li>
<li>Hardcover edition.</li>
<li>Thread stitching. </li>
<li>Featuring some incredible and never before published hybrids that will blow every Trichocereus Fan away. </li>
<li>There is also a special edition that comes with an alternate cover and tons of additional stuff that was only produced for this campaign.  </li>
<li>SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS portrays crosses between Trichocereus pachanoi and other species, some of which resulted in completely unique and never before seen hybrids. </li>
<li>This book also shows hybrids that are the result of intergeneric crosses between Trichocereus and more distant genera like Pseudolobivia or some of the clumping Echinopsis. </li>
<li>SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS is a unique and one-of-a-kind book that could only be made because the author dedicated his life studying the genus Trichocereus while chasing around rare plants all over the world.  Almost all of the known and highly respected Trichocereus breeders contributed photos and knowledge for this book, which is why there is an incredible range of hybrids to be seen here. </li>
<li>Contains crosses or clones involving Trichocereus pachanoi, Trichocereus peruvianus, Trichocereus cuzcoensis, Trichocereus terscheckii, Trichocereus bridgesii, Trichocereus validus, Trichocereus chalaensis, Trichocereus werdermannianus and many more. Including photos of the rare hybrids like the SAARLAND, SAARWELLE, LEICHTE FEDER, AMUN-RE and the new line of ZELLY hybrids, </li>
</ul>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What is this campaign about?</u></h2>
<p>To me, this campaign is not really about making a lot of money...I just wanna make the most beautiful Trichocereus book on the market (again!) and that´s why I need your help to cover the incredibly high printing costs. Without your help, we won´t be able to print this book. Period. We picked a goal that´s very doable and I am very positive we´ll reach it. In return you get a book that probably never would´ve seen the light of day if not for the amazing support of this community. The book is already written but we also need to bring in another editor to give the book a 100% professional edit. Editing is an almost as important part of a book creating process as writing and in the end it´s money well spent. With our last campaign we reached more than 15.000 Euro and this time we will knock the ball out of the park. <br/>Once again we urgently need your help to make sure we reach our goal again. We´ve been working the whole year in order to prepare this book and there is also lots of bonus content available for our supporters. Because we´re completely independent and self-publish our books, the prices are a little bit higher than the ones from the huge printing houses. Specialist literature is never cheap, and we just don´t have access to the resources that larger publishers have. By supporting us in this campaign, you will not only get some incredible perks like a beautiful book or Trichocereus related merchandise, but you also support independent book printing as a whole in your favorite niche. For self-publishing authors it becomes more and more difficult to come up with the printing costs, which is why it´s so important to have a community that´s standing behind them. We have a great project on our hands, but everything stands and falls with the community behind it. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Who am I? </u></h2>
<p>I am the crazy Evil Genius behind sites like Trichocereus.net and a contributing part of the Trichocereus community for a good 20 years now. I am an upstanding guy that´s always trying to do the right thing. My word is of great importance to me and I am obviously not in it for the money. A few years ago, I felt like there was an urgent need for a beautiful coffee table book about the genus Trichocereus so I simply made one myself. The success of that book was the result of a lot of work and love for the subject and now I am back with an even more beautiful follow-up book titled TRICHOCEREUS: SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS.<br/><br/>I deeply care about this subject and with all the experiences made during the production of the first book the game plan is already laid out. If we meet our goal we´ll use the same printer that already printed our first book. The printer has many years of experience in the book printing business and helps us with every step of the production.  This new SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS book will be of these independent gems that you just can´t get from the mass market and I can only recommend everyone to get a copy. The edition is tiny and it´s completely uncertain if there will ever be a reprint. The number of available books will be VERY limited. So better get one of these discounted copies while you can. </p>

<h3><u>What will we do with the money?</u></h3> <ul>
<li>We will use the money to pay for the printing costs. They are substantial and it´s the biggest part of the costs. </li>
<li>We will pay for a professional editor that will give the book a professional editing. </li>
<li>We will pay for the postage+shipping costs, shipping boxes, shipping material, etc. </li>
<li>We will also use this money to pay for the shirts, postcards and other promo material. </li>
<li>We will use the money to pay for things like tax declaration, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><u><strong>What will happen if we do not meet our goal?</strong></u></h2>
<ul><li> We have a very good community standing behind this book, so everything other than a big success would be surprising. To make it even more safe for our supporters we chose flexible funding. That means that even if we should not meet our goal, we will still be able to use the money we collected to print the book in the best possible way. We will do everything in our power to reach and even exceed that goal...but even if that wouldn´t be the case we have alternative route to get this book printed. If we´d not meet the goal we´d still honor and deliver the perks. We´d probably have to reduce the content/page count, but there´s no chance on earth that we´d not deliver this beautiful and amazing book. We already have customers standing in line getting it into their hands and we would find a way, even if hell freezes. </li></ul>
</div><p> </p><div>
<h3><u>Why we need your support and why this campaign is so important!</u></h3> <ul>
<li>In times of the internet and the never ending availability of free content it´s become very difficult for self-publishing authors or independent publishers to print beautiful books about niche subjects. You find all kinds of mediocre cactus books on ecommerce sites, but there are very few special interest books such as this one about the genus Trichocereus and unless you help to make it happen, there might not be one ever again. By supporting this book, you are directly supporting the genre of specialist literature in niches not mainstream enough for the big publishers. There´s not a lot of money to be made with something like this...and that´s okay because  we love the subject and only want everyone to have a cool book in their shelf. Very few things beat the feeling of having a beautiful book in your hands, and this one will be particularly beautiful. Even though eBooks are a great thing to have, you constantly lose them on your drives and it´s just not comparable to having a printed coffee table book in your hands. If you sometimes feel like there should be more specialist literature about your favorite subjects available, now is the time to support it. </li>
<li>With your support, you also help us to produce free content on our website. It took me years and thousands of hours of work and countless Trichocereus and Echinopsis photos to build the books and the website as they are today, and by supporting our projects you also help us keeping it great.  </li>
<li>Some of these photos were hard to come by and I don´t think someone will ever go through such lengths  to make a book of this kind again. It´s literally a miracle that we were given the chance to print the book in the form it is now and without your help it would not be possible. </li>
</ul>
</div><div> <h3><u>Risks and Challenges</u></h3> <p>With every project of this size there are risks involved. Below you find some of the things that could happen. </p> <ul>
<li>The printer could take the money and not send the books. Well, that´s theoretically possible but very, very unlikely since we already worked with this printer before. One of the reasons I chose this particular printer is because we can pay him with Paypal. That way, we´re pretty much covered and it gives us security that he´ll ship our books. It costs a little bit more because of the fees involved, but it gives our supporters and myself the security we need.  </li>
<li>There might be certain quality problems with the book, eg a few minimal printing problems, shipping damages, something like that. However, the printer has years of experience in printing and shipping books worldwide. The first book arrived at my doorstep well packed and beautifully done. It can always happen that some books have minor problems, but I´ll  give every copy a strict quality check and only send out excellent books. We also make a test print to make sure it´s great quality. </li>
<li>If we don´t meet our goals completely, we might have to make minor changes to the content, eg reduce the page count or certain parts of the book. However, it´s incredibly unlikely because we´ve got a great infrastructure that´s been screaming to get this book in their hands. </li>
<li>The editing might take longer than expected.  On this second book we will bring in another professional book editor to work on the book. With the first book, the editing time was very long and I want to reduce it by paying for an additional editor. After having done this once before, I know that good editing needs time and under no circumstances will we rush that incredibly important part of the production process. That said, we´ll do everything in our power to ship all the books and rewards as soon as possible. I know that we all can´t wait to get this book in our hands and we´ll work day and long nights to make it happen asap. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Timescale</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Our campaign will end on <strong>March 1st</strong>. It will take a good couple weeks until Indiegogo will pass the funds on to me after the end of the campaign. As soon as that happened I will book another editor to work on the book for 2-3 weeks. At the same time, I´ll bring in another designer to do certain design tasks such as the final special edition cover. It always takes time to get a book to print and I expect that we´ll be printing in May. After the books are printed it will take 2 months for the books to arrive at my door step. They´ll come by boat, so shipping takes a while.<br/>As soon as I got the books here I will unload the crates, check the quality of the books and start preparing the shipping of the books. Shipping so many books at once probably takes 3-6 weeks and I expect the shipping to begin around July. The date is not set in stone, but this book is already pretty much done and I don´t expect many delays somewhere along the road. It´s incredibly important to me that I send out a top notch product and I don´t want to bring a rushed book just to save a week or two. In the end, everyone will have a beautiful book and I swear it´ll be well worth the wait. </p>
<p>Some other perks like shirts, postcard set and posters will ship around April/May. If you get one of the box sets that contains both the book and the other perks, we will ship everything together to reduce shipping costs. If you wish to get separate shipping (eg the Postcards in April and the Book in July) please send me an email to EG@trichocereus.net and I´ll let you know the additional shipping costs.  </p>
<h2><u>Shipping information</u></h2>
<p>I ship all books and merchandise from Germany with DHL in a registered parcel. The standard rate for one book is 20 Euro for worldwide customers and 7 Euro for buyers within Germany. The books will be well packed in special boxes and wrapped with bubble wrap to keep some certain Postal services from damaging the book. There will be a tracking number for everything I ship out and if there are problems you can always send me a message and I´ll be happy to track it, </p>
<h3>
<u>Other ways to help this campaign</u>:</h3> <p>I know that some people are on a budget and if you can´t afford to buy the book, please consider getting one of the equally limited Postcard Sets or the Shirts. If you´re even to broke for that we´d greatly appreciate if you´d share this campaign on your social media profiles or tell your friends, family or fellow inmates about this book.</p>

</div><p>Thanks a lot to every supporter. It´s an honor that we can make these beautiful books for you and we´ll pay you back by making a beautiful book!</p></div>","Hey guys! My name is Patrick Noll and I am the author of the book TRICHOCEREUS: THE SAN PEDRO GROUP which we successfully financed through Indiegogo in 2016. Because of the incredible support of our community we were able to surpass all expectations BY FAR and delivered a wonderful hardcover book that is now in the hands of hundreds of happy owners! And now we´re back with the second volume called TRICHOCEREUS: SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS.
SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS will be a coffee table sized book (A4) with countless photos and descriptions of Trichocereus hybrids, clones and cultivars from all over the world. It contains hundreds of unique photos and information on a large number of Trichocereus clones, hybrids and cultivars. 
The Book Highlights

All books are extremely limited, hand numbered and personally signed by the author. It´s our way of expressing our gratitude towards our supporters and every single book will be signed. 
Extra large A4 coffee table type book with hundreds of photos
All color pages. This isn´t one of the books that is mostly black and white and only has a few color pics in the back. Pretty much all pages are in color and most of them have photos. 
Written in English, Self Published and not available in book stores. 
Hardcover edition.
Thread stitching. 
Featuring some incredible and never before published hybrids that will blow every Trichocereus Fan away. 
There is also a special edition that comes with an alternate cover and tons of additional stuff that was only produced for this campaign.  
SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS portrays crosses between Trichocereus pachanoi and other species, some of which resulted in completely unique and never before seen hybrids. 
This book also shows hybrids that are the result of intergeneric crosses between Trichocereus and more distant genera like Pseudolobivia or some of the clumping Echinopsis. 
SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS is a unique and one-of-a-kind book that could only be made because the author dedicated his life studying the genus Trichocereus while chasing around rare plants all over the world.  Almost all of the known and highly respected Trichocereus breeders contributed photos and knowledge for this book, which is why there is an incredible range of hybrids to be seen here. 
Contains crosses or clones involving Trichocereus pachanoi, Trichocereus peruvianus, Trichocereus cuzcoensis, Trichocereus terscheckii, Trichocereus bridgesii, Trichocereus validus, Trichocereus chalaensis, Trichocereus werdermannianus and many more. Including photos of the rare hybrids like the SAARLAND, SAARWELLE, LEICHTE FEDER, AMUN-RE and the new line of ZELLY hybrids, 














What is this campaign about?
To me, this campaign is not really about making a lot of money...I just wanna make the most beautiful Trichocereus book on the market (again!) and that´s why I need your help to cover the incredibly high printing costs. Without your help, we won´t be able to print this book. Period. We picked a goal that´s very doable and I am very positive we´ll reach it. In return you get a book that probably never would´ve seen the light of day if not for the amazing support of this community. The book is already written but we also need to bring in another editor to give the book a 100% professional edit. Editing is an almost as important part of a book creating process as writing and in the end it´s money well spent. With our last campaign we reached more than 15.000 Euro and this time we will knock the ball out of the park. Once again we urgently need your help to make sure we reach our goal again. We´ve been working the whole year in order to prepare this book and there is also lots of bonus content available for our supporters. Because we´re completely independent and self-publish our books, the prices are a little bit higher than the ones from the huge printing houses. Specialist literature is never cheap, and we just don´t have access to the resources that larger publishers have. By supporting us in this campaign, you will not only get some incredible perks like a beautiful book or Trichocereus related merchandise, but you also support independent book printing as a whole in your favorite niche. For self-publishing authors it becomes more and more difficult to come up with the printing costs, which is why it´s so important to have a community that´s standing behind them. We have a great project on our hands, but everything stands and falls with the community behind it. 
Who am I? 
I am the crazy Evil Genius behind sites like Trichocereus.net and a contributing part of the Trichocereus community for a good 20 years now. I am an upstanding guy that´s always trying to do the right thing. My word is of great importance to me and I am obviously not in it for the money. A few years ago, I felt like there was an urgent need for a beautiful coffee table book about the genus Trichocereus so I simply made one myself. The success of that book was the result of a lot of work and love for the subject and now I am back with an even more beautiful follow-up book titled TRICHOCEREUS: SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS.I deeply care about this subject and with all the experiences made during the production of the first book the game plan is already laid out. If we meet our goal we´ll use the same printer that already printed our first book. The printer has many years of experience in the book printing business and helps us with every step of the production.  This new SAN PEDRO HYBRIDS book will be of these independent gems that you just can´t get from the mass market and I can only recommend everyone to get a copy. The edition is tiny and it´s completely uncertain if there will ever be a reprint. The number of available books will be VERY limited. So better get one of these discounted copies while you can.

Ninguén confía nel, nin el mesmo. Namoradeiro, sentimental e un tanto desgraciado intentará poñer luz na escuridade a unha morte que envolve á cidade de Vigo. Os sentimentos son o seu peor inimigo e por iso acabarán pasándolle factura para facer terapia axudado polo seu caderno de erros.Quen?Do Peirao é unha editorial con vontade de cambio, de dar a alternativa a autores que non a atopan noutro lugar, con novas e refrescantes ideas como é o empregar unha campaña preventa para valorar a aceptación e viabilidade de cada título.Deste xeito es ti, agora que te estás expondo como colaborar, o que decide se a obra que che presentamos verá a luz pasando a formar parte do noso catálogo... porque consideramos ao lector parte fundamental do proceso.Hoxe presentásenos a Cándido Paniagua.Nacín en Xinzo de Limia, terra chairega e de grandes lendas. Amante das letras dende pequecho, decidín estudar unha carreira humanística, rematando con premio extraordinario fin de carreira no grao de estudos de galego e castelán (antigas filoloxías). Na actualidade vivo en Vigo e exerzo como profesor de ensino secundario transmitíndolle ás novas xeracións a importancia da palabra para crear historias.Voraz lector, especialmente da novela negra, comezo a escribir na adolescencia ata converterse nunha actividade diaria na miña vida. Escribo novelas e relatos curtos, que devecen por saír á luz. Este ano gañei o  3º premio do Xuventude Crea 2017 polo relato «Fado: 0103».Por que?Por aquí un fragmento do texto como mostra:«Quero presentar as miñas desculpas, mais non sei como facelo. Non sei nin por onde comezar. Andan a buscarme, intentando cargarme un morto do que eu non son culpable. Non busco que me comprendan, tan só quero escusar o meu comportamento infantil, propio desta situación que me desacouga e non me deixa durmir.     Quero poñer un pouco de luz neste túnel escuro no que andamos metidos todos. Os meus días están contados, sei demasiado, sei o que non debería saber, sei o porqué da morte de Diego, do meu Diego. Mais antes só lle quero pedir unha cousa, por favor, protexa as únicas persoas que me quedan, Pepe e Carme.     Sabía que o coñecía dalgo. Non aparecera porque si, o seu interese non era o disfrace que nos quixo amosar. Coñecíao. Sabía que coincidiramos anteriormente.

<h3>The Digital Plan</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My mission: Creating good strategy to use websites, social media, email, design, and video for positive change. This is my passion and I've helped create hundreds of plans for organizations and political candidates over the last eight years, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns, focusing on battleground states as Digital Training Director</li>
<li><span>Senate, Congressional, and Governor's races</span></li>

<li>Presidential Inaugural Committee’s National Day of Service</li>
<li><span>Rainforest Action Network and allies</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I frequently get asked by friends and allies if there is a template for digital plans. This book is designed to help folks understand the right questions to ask to create the plan they need.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need your support, because I find my time pulled by active campaigns I'm working on and finding that time to get this book finished is always illusive when there are active campaigns to work on. I'm asking you to support because I want to make this an active campaign to help others. </p>

<li>And we get practical guidance in the hands of more people running progressive campaigns. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Right now as we speak there is a project or progressive campaign that won't get the momentum it needs or they'll find themselves paying too much to consultants for too little digital strategy and output in return:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't want to have to tell another campaign for good in the world there isn't a great template.</li>
<li>I don't want to see another good campaign pay too much to a consultant when they could answer some of their own questions after $20 for this book and a few hours reading. </li>
<li>Having written and coached others on hundreds of plans I want to get that knowledge to more people. </li>
<li>This is about empowering others with knowledge to run good campaigns, launch beautiful projects, and win on progressive issues!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>Here's the real story. I've been working on a few drafts of sections over the last 3 years.

<br/><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Over the last 10 years, I have taught on numerous Jewish educational programs in the US, Canada, Central Europe, Israel and Australia. I completed an International MBA, worked at Deloitte as a Strategy Consultant and trained senior-level executives on their presentation skills. Currently, I work at a cool Israeli startup, mentor budding entrepreneurs at a technology accelerator and teach classes in the Tel Aviv area. I am married with three children, and I am living my dream.</p>
<p>While I was growing up, though, none of this seemed remotely possible... because I had a crippling stutter. </p>
<p>It started when I was three years old. My parents were encouraged to ignore it, as most speech impediments disappear by the time a child is five. Mine, however, did not. It just got worse. And it was a nightmare.</p>

Short Summary
Over the last 10 years, I have taught on numerous Jewish educational programs in the US, Canada, Central Europe, Israel and Australia. I completed an International MBA, worked at Deloitte as a Strategy Consultant and trained senior-level executives on their presentation skills. Currently, I work at a cool Israeli startup, mentor budding entrepreneurs at a technology accelerator and teach classes in the Tel Aviv area. I am married with three children, and I am living my dream.
While I was growing up, though, none of this seemed remotely possible... because I had a crippling stutter. 
It started when I was three years old. My parents were encouraged to ignore it, as most speech impediments disappear by the time a child is five. Mine, however, did not. It just got worse. And it was a nightmare.
I was ridiculed. I could not say my own name. At times, I could not even say the word ""hello"" when answering the phone! My future seemed bleak...and I was miserable.
What changed? How was I able to break out my shell? Where did I discover the courage to begin to public speak? Most importantly, what enabled me to transform my adolescent anger and frustration into inner-serenity and true happiness?
The answers to these questions (and much more) can be found in my upcoming memoir, The Gift of Stuttering (working title). The book describes my quest for meaning and purpose, notwithstanding my severe stutter. Through the use of stories and anecdotes, my book will bring you on a journey through my life, the ups and the downs, the highs and the lows. It narrates how I came to ultimately embrace my stutter, appreciate myself and become a happier person as a result.
As we all undergo adversity, it is not the adversity itself that defines us; rather, it is our response to it that truly shapes us. Therefore, regardless of the challenges you are currently facing (be it stuttering or otherwise), I am confident that you will gain refreshing and relevant insights by reading my book.

</p><p><b>Why This Book Is Needed</b></p>
<p>This campaign’s goal is to raise $6,500
for a book covering the media war against Mayor Rob Ford under the working
title <b><i>“Lynched: The Media War against Rob Ford.”</i></b> I am a Toronto-based
writer and blogger, who has followed these events for years (often with total
disbelief). Why is it important to publish a book about a person, who has been
loathed by so many people?</p>

Very
few politicians in the history of Canada have been the target of such vicious
and continuous campaign for destruction, organized by the media and special
interest groups, as Rob Ford has been. The attacks started long before any of
his personal problems were revealed. The lack of any sympathetic coverage about
a man, who has dedicated his life to serving the taxpayers, is disturbing.
Canada is described routinely as being one of the most polite and tolerant
countries in the world, yet the “progressive” media here can easily destroy a
person with the “wrong” political views. <p>This
is not just about Rob Ford – this is about exposing the ability of the media to
belittle and ruin a person, any person. And I am not talking about criticism of
his political views. That’s nothing – it is normal to criticize politician. The
issue is about the horrific way in which a human being is treated – hounded
methodically until his personality and his family are in shambles. It takes
extreme strength to withstand such pressure and on the surface it looks that
Ford has managed to handle the situation. However, his political career has
brought him no visible benefits after the long battles with those who hate his
politics, if we don’t count the satisfaction of his constituents.
(Theoretically, he would’ve been better off working in his business, but when people
with his convictions can’t hold an office, we will be served only by the
professional political freeloaders.)</p><p>
</p><p>It is important to tell that story,
because it is a precedent and a blueprint for dealing with any person who is
not liked by the media and the elites, often just because she or he has views
that don’t conform to what they think is better for us.</p>

Telling
the truth in a sea of hostility is not an easy task. You can’t rely on the
mainstream media, because they routinely belittle Ford’s achievements and mock
his supporters as mindless idiots. Using mainstream publishers is not easier
either – it is possible to get a fat deal with them only if you follow the
official line and keep close to the “sacred” principles of political
correctness (as the authors who published books about his life have done). <p>
</p><p><b>What We Will Need to Succeed </b></p>
<p>That leaves the self-publishing venue.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in that case there is no
publisher to bear most of the costs – the author has to take care of all steps
in the publishing process. As I mentioned in the beginning, the estimated
expenses are $6,500, which is a small fraction of what another fundraiser
collected with the intention to ruin Ford. (That is how life works – often you
can do good deeds with much less money.)</p>

I also
said that I have followed Rob Ford’s career for many years, collecting
information and writing articles about him. At my website you can read that
coverage. I have systematized tons of materials, mostly articles, which will be
the basis for the book, including pieces that their authors may want to forget
(I am probably being optimistic here). There might be a need for some extra
research, but only a fraction of the money would be spent on that.<p>
</p><p>The bulk of the raised money will be
spent on preparing the book for publication. That will include editing and
proofreading of the manuscript (it is always important that a professional eye
checks the work for errors and repetitions). The book will be published in two
editions – electronic (iBooks, Amazon Kindle, Barnes and Noble, and
downloadable PDF) and paperback. That would incur expenses for formatting both
editions – design and layout; there are different requirements for that. </p>
<p>Both versions will also need cover art,
which has to be formatted as an actual cover for each of them. A large amount
will be spent on advertising and promotion, which are important if we want the
book to reach as many people as possible. Also, money will be needed to fulfil
and deliver the items provided in the perks. </p>

If the
campaign doesn’t reach its goal, I will cover the outstanding expenses myself,
but that would slow down the whole process. There could be a delay in releasing
the book. If we reach the goal, all the extra money will be applied to promotion
and development of a similar future project.<p>

I am a reliable person and I complete every task I
start, especially when other people’s money and trust are at stake. A possible
risk is that some will probably try to sabotage and derail the project through
personal attacks – and that is almost sure, considering the subject I am
writing about. However, over the long years of writing on controversial
subjects (even when they are controversial only in the minds of the saboteurs)
I have received every possible threat, every insult and tons of hate mail. I
know very well how to handle the hate; it is even getting boring to do so.

</p><p><b>Other

<p>Of course, not everybody can contribute
financially, even though they may support the project. In this case you can help
in different ways – if you have a website, Facebook, Twitter or other social
network account, or even only an e-mail, or if you speak to your friends only
face to face, you can still let them know about this endeavor. You never know
who and how is going to help to spread the word.</p>

</h3>This is the campaign for my new erotic adventure novel <i>The Dragon Throne</i>.  This time I am going full-on Heroic Fantasy with magic swords, dragons, and evil wizards.<br/><br/><i>On the edge of the desert lies the kingdom of Umar, a crossroads of empires now long in decline. Once their dragons ruled the skies, but now they are few – a dying breed. For years the king’s grip on the Umar has been slipping, and now only paid armies and the ancient force of dragonriders maintain the throne. <br/><br/>Azera, daughter of the king, is the last of that fading lineage, her father’s only heir. Azera’s claim to the throne is tenuous, dogged by whispered rumors that she is cursed by her albino skin. Azera burns to prove herself, but when her chance comes, it comes with a price of blood. <br/><br/>In the wild desert lands of the south a new threat arises – a sorcerer who wields ancient power and rouses the nomad tribes into revolt. To Azera’s shock, her father falls in battle, and worse, the master of the dragonriders betrays the kingdom and joins the enemy.<br/><br/>Alone, Azera must try and rally the kingdom. Her only ally is Shabako – the enigmatic leader of those dragonriders who remain loyal. He stands by her side, and though she does not know what drives his loyalty, she has no choice but to trust him. In a storm of crisis and treachery, Azera must fight to hold </i>THE DRAGON THRONE.<br/><br/>So what makes this story so great?  Why should you support it?<br/><br/><ul>
<li>High Adventure!  This is a classic Heroic Fantasy story with lost empires, magic swords, dragonriders, and treacherous politics.</li>
<li>Diverse characters!  As a story set in a kingdom with a varied ethnic makeup, the cast will not be just a bunch of white people.</li>
<li>Strong female lead!  Azera is the main character, a realistically depicted albino and a young woman who has to take charge.</li>
<li>Action!  You know I like me some violence, and I guarantee <i>The Dragon Throne</i> will feature plenty of battles, escapes, and swordplay.</li>
<li>Perks!  Ebooks, print books, and more!  Perks include jewelry, dragonscale ornaments, cameos, and bonus scenes.</li>
<li>And as always, there will be hot, steamy sex.  In Adventurotica you don't just have to imagine your favorite characters hooking up.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am excited about this book.  I have not done a straight up dragons-and-swords fantasy as an Adventurotica story before, and I think it is going to be really good.  Please support me so I can keep writing the kind of plot-driven genre erotica no one else is doing!</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Funds go to pay my rent, bills, etc.  This is it, this is my livelihood.  I don't have a day job, so this is what I do. </li>
<li>All perks are fulfilled by me, by hand.  You will get to see the book written almost in real time, as it posts on <a href=""http://www.adventurotica.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.adventurotica.com</a> chapter by chapter.  Once it is done, the ebook will follow almost immediately, and then the print book.</li>
<li>Even if I don't reach goal, everyone gets what they paid for, no matter what.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's where I'm supposed to talk about how this project is important
 to the world.  Which probably seems silly, only I think this project - 
and others like it - are very important.  This is the cutting edge of 
the publishing business, and here I am trying to prove by example that a
 writer can make a living at what they want to do.  And I don't mean be 
one of the one-in-a-million longshots we all read about.  I mean being 
able to be good at what I do and with that carve out a career that can 
support my life. </p>

To Azera’s shock, her father falls in battle, and worse, the master of the dragonriders betrays the kingdom and joins the enemy.Alone, Azera must try and rally the kingdom. Her only ally is Shabako – the enigmatic leader of those dragonriders who remain loyal. He stands by her side, and though she does not know what drives his loyalty, she has no choice but to trust him. In a storm of crisis and treachery, Azera must fight to hold THE DRAGON THRONE.So what makes this story so great?  Why should you support it?
High Adventure!  This is a classic Heroic Fantasy story with lost empires, magic swords, dragonriders, and treacherous politics.
Diverse characters!  As a story set in a kingdom with a varied ethnic makeup, the cast will not be just a bunch of white people.
Strong female lead!  Azera is the main character, a realistically depicted albino and a young woman who has to take charge.
Action!  You know I like me some violence, and I guarantee The Dragon Throne will feature plenty of battles, escapes, and swordplay.
Perks!  Ebooks, print books, and more!  Perks include jewelry, dragonscale ornaments, cameos, and bonus scenes.
And as always, there will be hot, steamy sex.  In Adventurotica you don't just have to imagine your favorite characters hooking up.

I am excited about this book.  I have not done a straight up dragons-and-swords fantasy as an Adventurotica story before, and I think it is going to be really good.  Please support me so I can keep writing the kind of plot-driven genre erotica no one else is doing!   
 
What I Need & What You Get

Funds go to pay my rent, bills, etc.  This is it, this is my livelihood.  I don't have a day job, so this is what I do. 
All perks are fulfilled by me, by hand.  You will get to see the book written almost in real time, as it posts on www.adventurotica.com chapter by chapter.  Once it is done, the ebook will follow almost immediately, and then the print book.
Even if I don't reach goal, everyone gets what they paid for, no matter what.





The Impact
Here's where I'm supposed to talk about how this project is important
 to the world.  Which probably seems silly, only I think this project - 
and others like it - are very important.  This is the cutting edge of 
the publishing business, and here I am trying to prove by example that a
 writer can make a living at what they want to do.  And I don't mean be 
one of the one-in-a-million longshots we all read about.  I mean being 
able to be good at what I do and with that carve out a career that can 
support my life. 

Here I am dismantling the gatekeepers and the idea of the arts as a lottery.
I have run 13 campaigns to success before this one.
You help keep me alive, and I entertain you.  That's what I do here.

  Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute, the most important thing you can do is share.  The hardest thing about these campaigns is making my voice heard above the tumult of the internet and standing out.  Signal boost!  Reblogs, facebook posts, tweets - everything helps!",0.0,0,"17 Campaigns

<div>Some simple answers:</div>
<div>We have a mailing list of over 2,200 people. We plan an email campaign in which we will send out David's poetry on a weekly basis. The Epigraphs that begin each chapter of the novel will be sent on a bi-weekly basis, and we will send emails to announce our website, the publication of the novel, and our Indiegogo campaign. Our goal is to build a large cyberspace community.</div>
<div>We will utilize social media to communicate and to announce all the above. This will include Facebook, You Tube, Twitter, Google Plus, Linked In, our website and emails through Constant Contact. </div>
<div>We will be selling the novel through our website and through independent book stores. We will avoid using companies who focus only on the profit motive and do not have a broader vision of the need to create a kind and sustainable world. </div>
<div>This book will get printed whatever the outcome of this campaign. But, if this campaign is not successful, it will take a lot longer to raise the funds, and we will be forced to buy smaller quantities of books at a higher price. More importantly, we will not have the resources to reach the larger number of people who might be touched by this book.</div>
<div>Success will not be measured by the amount of money we make. Success will be measured by the number of people we touch... by the number of lives we change with this novel. Your contribution will give us the muscle to reach a much larger audience... the muscle to help create that change the world needs so desperately. </div>
<div>David, the author, is a natural connector. He loves people. Most of the 2,000 plus people on the email list are people he knows personally. He is near the end of the editing process on the novel and will soon be able to devote full time to contacting people about the book.</div>
<div>He has already talked to many reviewers, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">including Alan Cheuse from NPR, who has agreed to read the ARC. He has talked with Robin Young, co-host of 'Here and Now', a NPR news and culture program. She has also agreed to read the ARC.

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Erin McBride is an undergraduate student of the University of St Andrews in her third year of a degree in Management and International Relations, currently focusing on Organisation Studies and International Law.<br/><br/>She wrote this book as she has always had an interest in politics and felt it was difficult to find relevant information that would allow her to effectively participate and share her beliefs to the extent she wanted to.<br/><br/>After missing the deadline to vote in the Scottish Independence Referendum by a few months, Erin felt the disappointment of being restricted from participation firsthand which spurred a keen interest in politics. Despite being constantly frustrated and disheartened with the current state of our political system, Erin is always hopeful that she’ll get her chance to finally vote in another Independence Referendum.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Erin at erinmcbride12@gmail.com or through Instagram: @erinnmcbridee or Facebook: Erin McBride.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.<h3> </h3>

Erin McBride is an undergraduate student of the University of St Andrews in her third year of a degree in Management and International Relations, currently focusing on Organisation Studies and International Law.She wrote this book as she has always had an interest in politics and felt it was difficult to find relevant information that would allow her to effectively participate and share her beliefs to the extent she wanted to.After missing the deadline to vote in the Scottish Independence Referendum by a few months, Erin felt the disappointment of being restricted from participation firsthand which spurred a keen interest in politics. Despite being constantly frustrated and disheartened with the current state of our political system, Erin is always hopeful that she’ll get her chance to finally vote in another Independence Referendum.For more information you can connect with Erin at erinmcbride12@gmail.com or through Instagram: @erinnmcbridee or Facebook: Erin McBride.
 
Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. 
Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #RuleByThePeople and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page
Please share my book to 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it. Please do this as a text message or Direct Message on social media.
Thank you so much of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Erin",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p><i>How to Arrange Physics and Geography to Your Advantage</i> is Charlie Getter's first collection of new poems since 2011's three-volume collection, <i>The Garrulous Progress.</i></p>
<p>At once accessible, clever, and fun, <i>How to Arrange Physics and Geography to Your Advantage</i> is more than meets the eye. As one of the poems contained therein (""I live on an iceberg"") might imply, there's much beneath the surface, and like a fine Scotch chilled with Arctic ice (that's a reference—get the book and find out!), these poems are delightfully witty on the nose, yet develop a complex and beguilingly nuanced character when savored.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Author:</h3>
<p>Charlie Getter is the author of four poetry collections, and his work has appeared in numerous anthologies, journals, zines, and other publications. He's a founding member of the Collaborative Arts Insurgency (CAI), the group of artists, poets, emcees, and musicians responsible for the genesis of the ongoing 16th &amp; Mission street arts workshop that takes place every Thursday on the streetcorner at 16th &amp; Mission in San Francisco's Mission District.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About seven7h tangent</h3>
<p>seven7h tangent was founded in 2007 by a loose collective of writers, artists, poets, and designers who share a love of literature, out of a desire to bring the work of San Francisco's street poets and writers to your bookshelf. One of our earliest projects was <i>The 16th &amp; Mission Review</i>, a hand-bound bimonthly anthology featuring writing from the Thursday night gatherings, and distributed for free.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Buscando a felicidade e fuxindo dun ambiente hostil, Sabela saíra da aldea soa. Despois de nove anos durante os que estuda, traballa, namora... un feito dramático obrígaa a regresar precipitadamente e revivir todos os recordos dunha infancia chea de soidade, humillación illamento, inxustiza. Tiña que atopar respostas para cumprir unha promesa... pola súa nai, pero ademais porque só así podería poñer en marcha o motor do esquecemento.</p>
<h3>Quen?</h3>
<p><strong>Do Peirao</strong> é unha editorial con vontade de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionais pero de incuestionable calidade, con novas e refrescantes ideas como é o empregar unha campaña preventa para valorar a aceptación e viabilidade de cada título.</p>

No ámbito académico ten publicados diversos artigos en revistas e xornais especializados e varias obras en coautoría relacionadas coa cultura galega e propostas didácticas para a escola («Festas anuais na escola», «As adiviñas», «O Magosto», «O Nadal»... ); tamén outras relacionadas coa metodoloxía, a didáctica e a innovación («Traballar por proxectos nas aulas de infantil e primaria», «O proceso de adaptación... ¿E ti vas á escola?», «O traballo por proxectos en infantil, primaria e secundaria»...), coa perspectiva de xénero na educación («A igualdade como solución») primeiro premio no VI Concurso Literario Rosa de Cen Follas na modalidade de poesía coa obra <i>Silencio cómplice</i> (2013). </p>

Krenuo sam iz Hrvatske i kopnenim putem završio na Novom Zelandu. Nešto više od 1500 dana putovao sam preko triju kontinenata koristeći samo jedno specifično i nesvakidašnje prijevozno sredstvo - autostop! 'Prestopirao' sam preko<strong> 40 000 km</strong>, a kad sam konačno stigao na cilj, autostop sam zamijenio stopalima te sam prehodao cijeli Novi Zeland. <strong>1500 km u tri mjeseca.</strong><br/>Na put sam krenuo sa samo <strong>10 000 u džepu</strong>, tako da je putovanje spadalo u kategoriju niskobudžetnog. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593770191/vniofc0awjiojzslj0nc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><br/>Putovanje mi je donijelo na stotine zanimljivih priča, te isto tako nagradilo velikom dozom životnog iskustva koje sam odlučio podijeliti s vama.

I hitchhiked more than 40 000 km, and upon arrival I switched my thumb for my feet and walked the entire New Zealand. That’s 1500 km in 3 months.

Krenuo sam iz Hrvatske i kopnenim putem završio na Novom Zelandu. Nešto više od 1500 dana putovao sam preko triju kontinenata koristeći samo jedno specifično i nesvakidašnje prijevozno sredstvo - autostop! 'Prestopirao' sam preko 40 000 km, a kad sam konačno stigao na cilj, autostop sam zamijenio stopalima te sam prehodao cijeli Novi Zeland. 1500 km u tri mjeseca.Na put sam krenuo sa samo 10 000 u džepu, tako da je putovanje spadalo u kategoriju niskobudžetnog. Putovanje mi je donijelo na stotine zanimljivih priča, te isto tako nagradilo velikom dozom životnog iskustva koje sam odlučio podijeliti s vama. I zato sam odlučio napisati knjigu o svom putovanju. Devet mjeseci svakodnevnog pisanja to se i ostvarilo, a knjigu sam nazvao Putovanje u Međuzemlje. Knjiga mi ima preko 350 stranica, a u njima možete pročitati kako sam: 
Radio kao stažist u bolivudskim filmovima u Indiji
Stopirao 2400 km preko omanske pustinje
Živio s lejdibojevima u Tajlandu
Družio se sa šamanima u Indiji na najvećem spiritualnom festivalu na svijetu
Spavao na policijskim postajama diljem Azije
Stopirao po Bliskom istoku
Volontirao u školi sa nezabrinutom djecom u Indiji
Dva tjedna planinario po Himalaji i popeo se na 5416 nadmorske visine
Pio alkohol u Iranu
Bio u zatvoru
Spavao u domovima lokalnih ljudi diljem svijeta

Zaljubio se

<p><i>STORY</i></p>
<p>A mindful you is a passion project, derived from living in a world where the constant urge to overbuy is paraded in front of us and our children’s eyes everyday.</p>
<p>As parents, we often believe in order to be a good parent, we need to protect our children from disappointment. Therefore, we have a hard time saying no when a child’s desire is financially feasible (e.g. “it’s only a dollar!”). This behavior is not only evidenced in the wealthy, it is a common occurrence in most of our day to day lives. As parents, we do what we can, when we can, because....I guess...we can! In return we gratify our children’s immediate urge to buy “things” because we associate it with their happiness.</p>
<p>Being a professional organizer and interior stylist, I thrive on minimalism and the “less is more” approach. However, as a mother, I too struggle to implement these principles in my everyday life. It is human to want things, to get excited for change, and to want to treat yourself and others you love. </p>
<p>This behavior is not something to be ashamed of. Instead, it should bring light to the principles of progress, not perfection. What better way to start then introducing this concept to our children, in a whimsical and simple way?</p>
<p>My goal via a “A Mindful You” is to convey a realistic and reasonable message of minimalism, by teaching our youth that mindfulness and simplicity can go a long way. It will show us to really value our possessions and seriously think if we need more. In return, we will automatically implement more gratitude in our lives by focusing on all the things we have and not what we don’t have! Plus...we will seriously help our environment! Win win! </p>
<p><i>The Process</i></p>
<p>During these surreal and isolating times it’s hard to imagine making new friends.  I suppose that’s what makes it all the more special that Jen and I defied those odds and started a friendship. Jen is an illustrator whom I connected with online through a women’s group. We jumped on the phone for the first time but started talking like we had hundreds of conversations like this before; it was very serendipitous. We started chatting about ways to bring ‘ A Mindful You ‘ to life. Figuring out ways to visually portray the beautiful message to children to be mindful of their impact on our home, planet Earth. Jen quickly understood my desire to teach children the value of a day in the sun and a stroll on the beach vs. a new toy. In the hyper material world we live in, it’s easy to get caught up in acquiring things versus appreciating them. It seems the world is begging for us to take a moment and reconsider the systems we have in place. Jen and I are excited to bring to life, ‘ A Mindful You ‘ and hope that through its hand off, children and adults alike will begin to remember the things that bring them the most joy, and to realize that none of it was bought.</p>
<p>Given we are in a era defining moment, I want to get my message into the world as soon as possible and so I have decided to self publish. This allows me to have full control of the publishing timeline and makes it possible to get A Mindful You into the hands and hearts of people ASAP!</p>
<p><i>What We Need &amp; What You Get</i></p>

</div></div>","STORY
A mindful you is a passion project, derived from living in a world where the constant urge to overbuy is paraded in front of us and our children’s eyes everyday.
As parents, we often believe in order to be a good parent, we need to protect our children from disappointment. Therefore, we have a hard time saying no when a child’s desire is financially feasible (e.g. “it’s only a dollar!”). This behavior is not only evidenced in the wealthy, it is a common occurrence in most of our day to day lives. As parents, we do what we can, when we can, because....I guess...we can! In return we gratify our children’s immediate urge to buy “things” because we associate it with their happiness.
Being a professional organizer and interior stylist, I thrive on minimalism and the “less is more” approach. However, as a mother, I too struggle to implement these principles in my everyday life. It is human to want things, to get excited for change, and to want to treat yourself and others you love. 
This behavior is not something to be ashamed of. Instead, it should bring light to the principles of progress, not perfection. What better way to start then introducing this concept to our children, in a whimsical and simple way?
My goal via a “A Mindful You” is to convey a realistic and reasonable message of minimalism, by teaching our youth that mindfulness and simplicity can go a long way. It will show us to really value our possessions and seriously think if we need more. In return, we will automatically implement more gratitude in our lives by focusing on all the things we have and not what we don’t have! Plus...we will seriously help our environment! Win win! 
The Process
During these surreal and isolating times it’s hard to imagine making new friends.  I suppose that’s what makes it all the more special that Jen and I defied those odds and started a friendship. Jen is an illustrator whom I connected with online through a women’s group. We jumped on the phone for the first time but started talking like we had hundreds of conversations like this before; it was very serendipitous. We started chatting about ways to bring ‘ A Mindful You ‘ to life. Figuring out ways to visually portray the beautiful message to children to be mindful of their impact on our home, planet Earth. Jen quickly understood my desire to teach children the value of a day in the sun and a stroll on the beach vs. a new toy. In the hyper material world we live in, it’s easy to get caught up in acquiring things versus appreciating them. It seems the world is begging for us to take a moment and reconsider the systems we have in place. Jen and I are excited to bring to life, ‘ A Mindful You ‘ and hope that through its hand off, children and adults alike will begin to remember the things that bring them the most joy, and to realize that none of it was bought.
Given we are in a era defining moment, I want to get my message into the world as soon as possible and so I have decided to self publish. This allows me to have full control of the publishing timeline and makes it possible to get A Mindful You into the hands and hearts of people ASAP!

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>bedfellows</i></strong> is a coming-of-age story that explores love, and what being with someone and loving them means, beyond the romance and intimacy we expect.<br/><br/>I wrote this book because I wanted to explore and try to understand the complexities of wanting someone and being with them—what it means to be in love, what it means to be in a relationship. In my own experience, it’s never been as cut and dry as the romances that exist portray and I hope this book serves as a look into the real-life complexities of relationships. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the nuanced and raw chaos underneath the surface of relationships and romance. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to wonder and explore what being with someone means, begin to understand what identity and the constant pursuit of who we are really is, and ask questions about what we believe love is, what we’re taught it should be, and what we really truly want it to be beyond that.<br/><br/>The book follows an Indian-American girl, Kash, throughout her teenage years into her early twenties, and navigates the unknowns of falling in love and attraction through her eyes. It’s not easy, and it’s wrought with teenage wanting, attraction, and the visceral confusion of not knowing who she is or what she wants. The story is punctuated by moments where Kash shares a bed with certain people in her life and how sharing such a vulnerable space with someone changes her relationship with them.<br/><br/>If you enjoy exploring the more metaphysical, philosophical side of love and intimacy and unconventional romance as well as the relatable inner chaos of growing up (with copious amounts of angst), then I think you'll enjoy this book.<br/><br/><strong><i>bedfellows</i></strong> speaks to new adult and coming-of-age readers who want to grapple with both the complexities of growing up and defining ourselves to others, and intimacy—what it means to be with someone and the different ways we fall in love—in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <strong><i>bedfellows</i></strong> inspires you to think, challenge, and engage with questions like:</p>
<p><i>How do we (and do we ever) ‘grow up’ as individuals? </i></p>
<p><i>How do we know what we want? And how do our wants and desires define us?</i></p>
<p><i>Can romance and/or attraction be more than just platonic or physical?</i></p>
<p><i>What are the different ways we express love, in all its forms?</i></p>
<p><i>How does the intimacy and vulnerability of sharing a personal space (i.e. a bed or bedroom, a car, a childhood escape, etc.) affect the way we connect with others?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with you! I believe discussing, and realizing how different our answers are to these questions, will change us all for the better. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Nivita Chaliki is a current student at Parsons School of Design in New York, and an artist of many mediums within various genres and areas all of which she simplifies into one word; storyteller. <br/>Her work is much informed by her experiences navigating identity and culture as an Indian-American girl, as well as a personal creativity with which she tries challenge the norms she sees around her. She loves to get caught up in the wonder of the human mind, and often finds herself within the gray areas of philosophy and design, questioning and learning wherever she can.<br/><br/>She began writing ‘bedfellows’ through a curiosity to dig deeper into what it means to be in a relationship with someone and how we define what we want as individuals. Inspired by her own experiences and inner struggles with translating conventional romance into real-life relationships, finding who she wants to be, and her own conflicting identity growing up as an Indian-American, Nivita wanted to tell this story to try and narrate the visceral tension and chaos of being young and trying to understand what we want both from ourselves and others. She hopes this book also contributes to a lacking but growing space of representation for South Asian diaspora, and their stories.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Nivita Chaliki at nchaliki@yahoo.com and @nivitachaliki on Instagram. Please reach out if you have any questions, concerns, or just general wonderments!</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2><p>Unbreakable is about accepting who you are and the stigma around mental health which is why a lot of people silently struggle.</p><p><br/>My name is, Carolyn Skowron, and I am the author of Unbreakable. I wrote this book because I want to help raise awareness of mental health issues, and help end the stigma. We need to start talking about mental health and be less judgmental of each other. We need to start treating one another with more respect and empathy, as well as recognize that we are all unique, special, and should never give up. In writing this book, my hope is that it might save at least one life.<br/><br/>Almost 1 in 5 adults suffer from a mental illness. In 2017, roughly 46.6 million people were diagnosed with mental health issues in the United States alone. If you or someone you know struggles with mental health, know that you are not alone. My hope is that Unbreakable will help others to find the courage they need to speak up, and seek help. You will see, through the stories I share, that you are worth it and that perspective is everything. I want people to find their own passions and become happy from within themselves and live a more positive and healthy life. It is time we start being real and vulnerable because life is too short to not make the most of it. We need to not be so ashamed of our issues and be open and honest with each other. Most importantly we need to to understand that none of us are perfect, we are all perfectly imperfect. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about self-acceptance and self-love. You'll hear stories about:</p><p>Early childhood bullying, and how this can effect you as you grow up </p><p>How the stigma and judgement can really affect your self confidence and worth </p><p>How I changed my perspective as I grabbed my seat belt three seconds before a car accident and luckily survived</p><p>Unbreakable is a nonfiction book that speaks to teens and young adults, and is important to read if you want to learn more as well as be more aware about mental health. It will also will show that you are not alone, and with the right tools and support you can get through anything.</p><h2>Unbreakable</h2><p>THIS BOOK IS DIVIDED INTO 4 PARTS:<br/>Part 1 Contains the introduction + chapters 1-4. From the introduction to chapter 4 you see how the words and actions of young adolescent experiences can really have an impact on confidence and self-worth growing up. This section also shows that none of us are the same, we are all different, and so are our struggles. I also show you that even though I almost got to the point of ending my life, I thankfully got help and realized that it was okay to not be okay, but I needed to get help. I learned silently struggling is not the answer, help is. I also share that no one deserves to treat someone differently because of who they are, as we are all broken in someway, and we all are human.<br/><br/>Part 2 Contains chapters 5-9. From chapters 5 to 9 you will see how even when you think giving up is the answer, there is always hope, and there is a light at the end of tunnel. You will see how important it is to surround yourself with good people and to make sure you have a more positive outlook on life, even in the darkest of times. As much as it’s great to have people look out for you, you have to also watch out for yourself. Sometimes, you have to be able to save yourself. It is important to put yourself first. I show, through my own experiences, how much the stigma of mental health affects society and many adolescents today. I talk about the misconception of when people think “you have it all” when in fact, you don’t; not if you’re lacking true happiness within yourself. Materialistic things don’t bring one happiness, only being happy with who we are can bring that. We can do this by becoming stronger and more confident in ourselves if we buy into getting and recieving help. <br/><br/>Part 3 Contains chapters 9-11. From chapters 9-11 you will see how important it is to live each day to the fullest, as well as not let other people get in the way of your happiness. We all make mistakes but it is important to learn from them and not regret our past. We need to look at each opportunity as a chance to grow into a stronger more resilient individual. Our mistakes aren’t what define us, they are what make us human, because none of us live a perfect life. We can’t change the past but we can learn and use those experiences to have different outcomes in the future. You will also see how “trying to please everyone” is nearly impossible, and you will drive yourself crazy trying to do so. Letting other people determine what you do because of the sole fact that you want to please them will be more detrimental to your mental health than you think. The most important thing to remember is that your flaws do not define you and what people think of you doesn’t matter. All that matters is that you are happy, and can find happiness with yourself.<br/><br/>Part 4 Contains chapters 12-14. From chapters 12-14 you will see how through writing this book, I found myself. I learn that life can’t be forced, and that it is a constant journey with twists and turns. Life is about adapting and adjusting because nothing in life goes as planned. I show after years of my own struggles that it is important to do what brings you joy, and focus on how you want to live. Live your life, do not worry about everyone else's, and find what makes you happy. If we spread a little more love, and we're a little more empathetic, we might be able to live in a better and less toxic world. I close with showing you that life will never be perfect, but we are constantly growing into a better version of ourselves. We should never try to be anyone but ourselves and we should be kind to each other because a smile can go a long way.</p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

She is a presenter for National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and has a passion for helping others. She is a resilient and driven individual who is surprising herself with this new endeavor of becoming an author. She has a big heart and is empathetic towards others, and hopes that this book will bring awareness and empathy towards those who have been in a similar position as her. <br/><br/>Carolyn wrote this book because a life threatening car accident changed her view of life. She’d like for that new perspective to inspire others as it has her, as well as have an impact on teens and young adults in particular, so that they may learn to be less harsh on themselves and each other. Her passion is helping people and making people smile. She’d like to see the stigma of mental illness end, and for people to be more kind to one another.<br/><br/>Carolyn enjoys reading and hanging out with friends but at the same time, she loves to just relax and watch Netflix. She also enjoys baking and is in the process of learning how to cook more than just spaghetti and ramen. She has a very sarcastic but witty personality, and her friends like to make fun of her klutziness, considering she has had four concussions.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Carolyn Skowron at carolyn.skowron@gmail.com and on instagram: @Carolyn9787 and twitter as well @SkowronCarolyn. <br/> </p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

You'll hear stories about:Early childhood bullying, and how this can effect you as you grow up How the stigma and judgement can really affect your self confidence and worth How I changed my perspective as I grabbed my seat belt three seconds before a car accident and luckily survivedUnbreakable is a nonfiction book that speaks to teens and young adults, and is important to read if you want to learn more as well as be more aware about mental health. It will also will show that you are not alone, and with the right tools and support you can get through anything.UnbreakableTHIS BOOK IS DIVIDED INTO 4 PARTS:Part 1 Contains the introduction + chapters 1-4. From the introduction to chapter 4 you see how the words and actions of young adolescent experiences can really have an impact on confidence and self-worth growing up. This section also shows that none of us are the same, we are all different, and so are our struggles. I also show you that even though I almost got to the point of ending my life, I thankfully got help and realized that it was okay to not be okay, but I needed to get help. I learned silently struggling is not the answer, help is. I also share that no one deserves to treat someone differently because of who they are, as we are all broken in someway, and we all are human.Part 2 Contains chapters 5-9. From chapters 5 to 9 you will see how even when you think giving up is the answer, there is always hope, and there is a light at the end of tunnel. You will see how important it is to surround yourself with good people and to make sure you have a more positive outlook on life, even in the darkest of times. As much as it’s great to have people look out for you, you have to also watch out for yourself. Sometimes, you have to be able to save yourself. It is important to put yourself first. I show, through my own experiences, how much the stigma of mental health affects society and many adolescents today. I talk about the misconception of when people think “you have it all” when in fact, you don’t; not if you’re lacking true happiness within yourself. Materialistic things don’t bring one happiness, only being happy with who we are can bring that. We can do this by becoming stronger and more confident in ourselves if we buy into getting and recieving help. Part 3 Contains chapters 9-11. From chapters 9-11 you will see how important it is to live each day to the fullest, as well as not let other people get in the way of your happiness. We all make mistakes but it is important to learn from them and not regret our past. We need to look at each opportunity as a chance to grow into a stronger more resilient individual. Our mistakes aren’t what define us, they are what make us human, because none of us live a perfect life. We can’t change the past but we can learn and use those experiences to have different outcomes in the future. You will also see how “trying to please everyone” is nearly impossible, and you will drive yourself crazy trying to do so. Letting other people determine what you do because of the sole fact that you want to please them will be more detrimental to your mental health than you think. The most important thing to remember is that your flaws do not define you and what people think of you doesn’t matter. All that matters is that you are happy, and can find happiness with yourself.Part 4 Contains chapters 12-14. From chapters 12-14 you will see how through writing this book, I found myself. I learn that life can’t be forced, and that it is a constant journey with twists and turns. Life is about adapting and adjusting because nothing in life goes as planned. I show after years of my own struggles that it is important to do what brings you joy, and focus on how you want to live. Live your life, do not worry about everyone else's, and find what makes you happy. If we spread a little more love, and we're a little more empathetic, we might be able to live in a better and less toxic world. I close with showing you that life will never be perfect, but we are constantly growing into a better version of ourselves. We should never try to be anyone but ourselves and we should be kind to each other because a smile can go a long way.What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in [April, 2021].The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this [Spring].When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook. I have personally decided to donate any profit made after 250 books are pre-sold to two very special causes. Half will go to NAMI (National Alliance of Mental Illness) as this is an important organization to me because I am apart of it but I also want others to be aware of how important mental health is. The other half of the proceeds will be donated to Leukemia and Lymphoma Society as I recently learned this week one of my best friends has just been diagnosed with leukemia and I would love to help in anyway possible. I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.You will receive early access to the Introduction and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review them and give me early feedback.You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.And much more!About the AuthorCarolyn Skowron is a recent college graduate from Chatham University with a degree in marketing. She is a presenter for National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and has a passion for helping others. She is a resilient and driven individual who is surprising herself with this new endeavor of becoming an author. She has a big heart and is empathetic towards others, and hopes that this book will bring awareness and empathy towards those who have been in a similar position as her. Carolyn wrote this book because a life threatening car accident changed her view of life. She’d like for that new perspective to inspire others as it has her, as well as have an impact on teens and young adults in particular, so that they may learn to be less harsh on themselves and each other. Her passion is helping people and making people smile. She’d like to see the stigma of mental illness end, and for people to be more kind to one another.Carolyn enjoys reading and hanging out with friends but at the same time, she loves to just relax and watch Netflix. She also enjoys baking and is in the process of learning how to cook more than just spaghetti and ramen. She has a very sarcastic but witty personality, and her friends like to make fun of her klutziness, considering she has had four concussions.For more information, you can connect with Carolyn Skowron at carolyn.skowron@gmail.com and on instagram: @Carolyn9787 and twitter as well @SkowronCarolyn.  Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #[Unbreakable] and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.Thank you so much for of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Carolyn Skowron",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Life is Fair is about leveraging Awareness, Self-knowledge and the Power of your Mind for Success and Happiness. This is a book that will give you the personal empowerment and freedom to be, do and have anything.<br/><br/>My name is Tommy Ajayi and I am the author of Life is Fair. I wrote this book because of Millennials and Generation Z. Research has now revealed that this group are the most stressed generation in our society today—they are depressed, unhappy and scared about the future. I had a similar dark night of the soul experience in my life. And came out victorious.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what makes your heart sing and soul dance. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement in you that I have for Life is Fair. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you discover your own personal empowerment and freedom to choose the reality you desire.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about using Awareness, Self-knowledge and the Power of Your Mind to choose a Successful and Happy life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness - When you take a good look at what is going on in your outside world and then you do an inventory of what is going on in your inner world, chances are both worlds are the same. If there is fear, struggle, or anger inside you, it will show up in your outside world.</li>
<li>Self-knowledge - Our origins are rooted in nature, and what we do to nature we do to ourselves. When we poison the oceans and rivers, we still have to drink the same water; when we contaminate the air, it is the same air we will breath; when we infect the soil, we still have to eat the food that comes from the soil because it is the soil that nourishes and feeds us.</li>
<li>You live in a Fair World; a world that doesn’t favour a culture or race. It doesn’t speak French, Hindi, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, or English; it only speaks energy and favours only one race: The Human Race.</li>
<li>Power of Your Mind - Whether you aware or not, your body and mind are close friends that are entangled in a conversation all day - in the shower, in traffic, at work, during your drives, during lunch, during dinner. Every moment of the day, the mind is constantly chatting up the body, and asking it on a date.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you crave a lifestyle of inner success and happiness<br/><br/>Life is Fair is a non-fiction book that speaks to Millennials and Generation Z who are looking to create a lifestyle that allows them personal empowerment and freedom for the first time.</p>
<h3>The Book - Life is Fair</h3>The book is written in 3 Parts<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + Chapter 1-7. This part focuses on why we crave external validation and blame others. Then, we will explore mind science and what it takes to create your own reality.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 8-11. The section examines the basic principles of a “Life is Fair” mindset.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 12-15. This section looks at how to apply a “Life is Fair” mindset in all areas of life: high school, college, university, early in career, and later in life. Together, we will look at the cheat codes to the game of life and help you realize that the cards are truly stacked in your favour once you start your engines.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Tommy Ajayi discovered writing at the age of seventeen as a way of escaping reality when he was battling depression and loneliness. He found so much solace in writing that he was able to write himself out of pain and into satisfaction. Tommy now spends his time looking for opportunities to inspire others in his day-to-day life which led him to share his writing with others. His debut book was inspired by Wayne Dyer, who was regarded by many as the father of motivation. When Tommy isn’t writing, you will find him dancing or performing salsa.<br/><br/>I was inspired to write this book because of Millennials and Gen Z. I had a similar dark night of the soul experience - Prior to enrolling in college, I was depressed, sad and scared about the future. And it wasn’t until I took a break from college to meditate and go within for 3 months that I was able to create a change and transformation in my life. This inward journey allowed me to gain awareness, self-knowledge and develop my mind. And this book is going to take you on a similar journey - it is a call for hope and change. You will be inspired to develop the personal empowerment and freedom to be; to do; and to have anything.<br/><br/>When am not writing, you will see me on the dance floor - busting one or two moves.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Tommy at tommy.ajayi@gmail.com and facebook @piooajayi; twitter @piooajayi; instagram @piooajayi; linkedin @ooajayi</p>

Life is Fair is about leveraging Awareness, Self-knowledge and the Power of your Mind for Success and Happiness. This is a book that will give you the personal empowerment and freedom to be, do and have anything.My name is Tommy Ajayi and I am the author of Life is Fair. I wrote this book because of Millennials and Generation Z. Research has now revealed that this group are the most stressed generation in our society today—they are depressed, unhappy and scared about the future. I had a similar dark night of the soul experience in my life. And came out victorious.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what makes your heart sing and soul dance. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement in you that I have for Life is Fair. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you discover your own personal empowerment and freedom to choose the reality you desire.In this book, you'll learn about using Awareness, Self-knowledge and the Power of Your Mind to choose a Successful and Happy life:

Awareness - When you take a good look at what is going on in your outside world and then you do an inventory of what is going on in your inner world, chances are both worlds are the same. If there is fear, struggle, or anger inside you, it will show up in your outside world.
Self-knowledge - Our origins are rooted in nature, and what we do to nature we do to ourselves. When we poison the oceans and rivers, we still have to drink the same water; when we contaminate the air, it is the same air we will breath; when we infect the soil, we still have to eat the food that comes from the soil because it is the soil that nourishes and feeds us.
You live in a Fair World; a world that doesn’t favour a culture or race. It doesn’t speak French, Hindi, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, or English; it only speaks energy and favours only one race: The Human Race.
Power of Your Mind - Whether you aware or not, your body and mind are close friends that are entangled in a conversation all day - in the shower, in traffic, at work, during your drives, during lunch, during dinner. Every moment of the day, the mind is constantly chatting up the body, and asking it on a date.

You will love this book if you crave a lifestyle of inner success and happinessLife is Fair is a non-fiction book that speaks to Millennials and Generation Z who are looking to create a lifestyle that allows them personal empowerment and freedom for the first time.
The Book - Life is FairThe book is written in 3 PartsPart 1 contains the introduction + Chapter 1-7. This part focuses on why we crave external validation and blame others. Then, we will explore mind science and what it takes to create your own reality.Part 2 contains Chapters 8-11. The section examines the basic principles of a “Life is Fair” mindset.Part 3 contains Chapters 12-15. This section looks at how to apply a “Life is Fair” mindset in all areas of life: high school, college, university, early in career, and later in life. Together, we will look at the cheat codes to the game of life and help you realize that the cards are truly stacked in your favour once you start your engines. What I Need & What You'll Get

After 16 solid years in the industry, when I thought my life was set, I had a spiritual awakening that changed my future forever in ways that I could not fathom. While contemplating career alternatives, I was led consciously to leave the corporate world with no regret and without a plan of action. In my heart I knew I needed time off to pursue my spiritual journey and contemplate what was next for me.  My awakening led me to channel the text ‘The Lion’s Wisdom’.</span></p>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is to facilitate the publishing of the book in its entirety. The monies from the campaign are to further the book in every aspect, ranging from promotions to printing. The goal is to get the book in as many hands as possible. Given the plight of Mother Earth, the message in the book is urgent in its nature to nurture the planet and the world we live in.</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>By funding this project, those who contribute will be supporting a cause that is larger than us. The contributors are funding a movement; the movement is to conserve all of Mother Earth’s inhabitants. This book is a vehicle which has opened minds and changed view points. Per the book, if we do not awaken now, we will be forced to witness the devastation of the beauty that is innately present.  </p>

<p>We need $6000 to cover the initial expenses of printing and promoting the book.  This breaks down as follows:</p>

<p>$ 3,000 - Promotion</p>
<p>$ 2,500 - Printing for the Book Release on September 10, 2019</p>

<p>The short-term goal is to produce this book. The long-term goal of this book, and therefore the value, is to raise awareness of the way we treat plant and animal life. The reason we treat them as such is because we have set aside the innate connection that exists between all forms of life. Therefore, we decide who is better and who is not. This mindset has contributed to the extinction of animal and plant life and the devastation that is currently occurring. Our goal is to educate as many people as possible to understand the havoc we have created and restore the abundant nature of life. Unless we respect the plant and animal species, we are marching towards a world, which will likely be uninhabitable.</p>

We are the future generation that will continue the legacy. We are calling out to all little ones on Mother Earth to come and join our army. We play, we laugh, we love, we cry in this army. We are filled with emotions of joy, love and peace. We offer you our paws. Aren’t we cute? Aren’t we cuddly? Aren’t our paws soft as a cushion? Won’t you play with us? Look at my eyes, big and bright? Would you like to see the glow in my eyes stay forever?

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>Party Pooper: Growing up with Anxiety is all about my own personal struggle with anxiety starting at the young age of four, and how I handled and learned to cope with it. <br/><br/>My name is Grace Ehlers and I am the author of Party Pooper: Growing up with Anxiety. I wrote this book because I want people to see my own story, and see that if I was/am able to learn and grow from my hardest battle, anyone can. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what it is really like for someone to have such a long-lasting mental health battle. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for mental health in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you learn that all you really need in life is a little determination, a few laughs, and a whole lot of faith.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about what anxiety can really look like from a young age to a young adult's perspective and how I, myself, learned to cope through different phases of my life including:<p>When I was in elementary school, I cried more days than not on my way to school, simply because I was always anxious. It didn’t help when in my second grade year I had a strict teacher, and I began to really struggle with some of her ways. I got in trouble for things like not eating all of my lunch and another time for saying “ew” during a lesson where raisins were compared to chocolate chips. I began to stress out more due to the fear of possibly getting in trouble over something minor, and my parents started to notice my stress getting worse. So, they switched me to a different teacher, and to put it “nicely”, I was outraged. I didn’t like change, and I was scared to start over with a new teacher. My parents told me if I could just get through one day with my new teacher then I might like her and may feel at least a little better about going to school. I cried on the way to school like always, but I was determined to get through the day. I ended up loving my new teacher. </p>
<p>After I had begged for a baby sister for what felt like ages, I was eight when my parents announced to me and my two older siblings that we were going to adopt a child. I was almost nine when we were put on a waiting list for a baby girl from Ethiopia, Africa. I was nine when we decided to host a nine and a ten year old girl from Ukraine for three weeks in the summer. The three weeks flew by, and my heart was crushed at their departure. About a month later, I was told that we were only approved to adopt either the baby or the girls. A couple of months later, my family and I flew to Ukraine to finalize the adoption of the girls we had fallen in love with back in the summer. Our family would end up facing many struggles, and faith would teach us how to survive it all. </p>
<p>When the time came for me to go to high school after being homeschooled for a few years, I freaked out. It was like one mental breakdown after the next. At one point during my eighth grade year, I refused to leave my room for three months. One mental breakdown in specific will always stand out. During one summer evening before my freshman year of high school, my parents were talking to my oldest sister in their room when I came flying in and threw myself on the floor. I was screaming at them, and telling them they absolutely could not send me to high school. Once I gained some composure, I was told to go and watch Frozen. I needed to be distracted from the overload of anxious thoughts about high school, and I needed something to make me laugh. If I’m laughing, I’m not crying. Olaf was my weakness, and I calmed down very quickly while watching the movie. I would watch Frozen many more times leading up to high school. </p>You will love this book if you struggle with anxiety or worrying to any degree, or just want to learn more about people who struggle with their mental health.<br/><br/>Party Pooper: Growing up with Anxiety is a non-fiction book that speaks to those struggling and those that want to learn more about those who are struggling by looking at what anxiety can really look like from a young age to a young adult’s perspective and how I, myself, learned to cope through different phases of my life.<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Party Pooper: Growing up with Anxiety</h3>The book is written in 4 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + Chapters 1-5. These chapters are about my elementary school years. I discuss the very start of my anxiety which came about because of a nightmare I had of my older brother throwing up on me in the car. I also discuss the adoption of two of my sisters, as well as emphasize what my anxiety was like traveling to Ukraine. <br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 6-11. These chapters are about my middle school years. I discuss, not only my family deciding to adopt two more children from Ukraine, but also, my struggle with confidence and comparing myself to my sisters who are very close in age to me. I also discuss my huge downfall with anxiety in my eighth grade year. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 12-15. These chapters are about my high school years. I talk about the anxiety I faced when I switched from being homeschooled to attending a public high school, and how despite it all, I ended up loving it. I also discuss my high school relationship that ended up lasting the entirety of high school. <br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapter 16-19. These chapters are all about my life now. I discuss my breakup after dating the same guy for four years, and all that I was able to learn and take away from it. I discuss what my anxiety is like today, and whether or not, I still see myself as a party pooper or not. <p> </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Last year I found myself in an interesting position. Although a poet since 1987, I'd taken a 10-year break from creative writing to raise a family and pursue urban photography in my home city of Philadelphia. I had just begun to re-ignite my involvement in poetry when I was approached by one of the editors at Lucky Bat Books, who saw the value in combining my poems and photographs in a single book. The ebook, <i>Far from Luck</i>, was published in August, followed in October by the print edition. Despite single works being published in over 100 literary journals, this is my first full-length collection. A portion of all proceeds (20%) go to Project H.O.M.E. in Philadelphia, PA. Project H.O.M.E. is a nonprofit advocacy organization committed to ending homelessness.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign will allow me to have my book professionally marketed, using both traditional and online marketing. This will not only mean increased revenue for my family, but for Project H.O.M.E. as well. An additional goal is to improve society's view and treatment of homeless people, whose ranks have been enlarged by the Great Recession. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would like to hire a professional PR person to help me market, promote, and garner more professional reviews of my book, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Far From Luck.</span> The more I raise, the more promotion and marketing I can do. If I don't make my full goal, I will still be able to do a moderate amount of marketing. At this point I have no other funding sources (I wouldn't be here if I did). I plan on bringing out a second book in 2012, and by marketing my current book, my hope is to get my name out there as an author, poet, and photographer in order to garner more book sales, both for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Far From Luck </span>and my next book.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As I walk the streets of Philadelphia, I frequently meet and talk with the homeless. I've found that an easy way to help is to purchase gift cards to a pharmacy or restaurant chain and to hand them out to those in need. I've documented this in my photography project, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/7204187@N03/sets/72157625750612325/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Everyone Has a Name</a>, which highlights that homelessness is not just a social issue, but a very personal issue. <br/></p>

<p>If you believe in this project as much as I and my publisher and editor do, please, spread the word. Use social media, talk to friends, or use some of the share tools here at IndieGoGo. Everything is appreciated. Thank you.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have always served as an advocate for the underdog, but even more importantly I've always tried to find ways to help others make a better life for themselves. As the previous Executive Director of a local therapeutic horseback riding facility, I saw the power of the equine/human bond up close and know families who had lost all hope find progress and success. And by success I mean a child of six who never spoke asking her horse to ""walk-on” Another young child with disabilities who was not able to walk without falling down now RUNNING without falling... and I have hundreds of other stories just like these. Most importantly, I believe in the power of therapeutic riding and know what a great opportunity a book on this topic would be to raise awareness and promote this type of therapy... to reach other families who have lost hope and desperately need to find something that will bring them respite as well as progress.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>Need:</strong></div>
<div>
<strong><br/></strong>$6,000.00 is what I need to get this book done within the next 12 months. It will allow me to focus on the project, commit to the stories, and work with a publisher to get it on the shelves and into the hands of those for whom it will make a difference. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This will be my salary for an entire year, but it's all I need to be able to conduct all the interivews for every story and get the entire project to my publisher by this time next year. I have identified 10 stories and will pick up more if necessary.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anything over $6,000 will go for editing, photography, and book promotion. This project has the potential to change the lives of thousands throughout the country. I already have PATH, International willing to help promote the book to it's 800-center and 43,000-member constituency.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We will raise awareness in the communities that house therapeutic riding and will get information out to local clinics, doctors, physical therapists in order to ensure that folks in need will know of this option.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If the goal is not met, I will continue the project through completion regardless. All funds will go toward that end and every penny will help me to reach the end project as soon as possible.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Be a part of a project that will give a hand up, not a hand out! Your contributions WILL make a difference to those in need. If you believe in the power of the human/animal bond, this is the project to support!</div>
<p><strong>What makes me think I can successfully do this?</strong></p>
<p>Most importantly it's because I know how this works and I have seen the miracles it has produced, both in physical results as well as internal growth and change. I also know I can do this because I started writing over 20 years ago, have completed and published a graduate thesis, numerous academic articles, more than a dozen articles published online, a recent article published in Arts &amp; Understanding, not to mention the hundreds of technical writing projects and grants funded.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Huge.
<p>The key factor that keeps folks in need from this kind of treatment is that they simply do NOT know it exists. This book will compile the story of 10 - 20 riders who now have hope... who now know what successful treatment is all about... who faced their fears and now know what courage can bring to their lives. These are stories are about children who speak their first words on a horse, adults who are able to go back to work because they now have the core strength to sit up all day, and teenagers who learn to control their anger and have now developed healthy coping mechanisms. All of these stories are about how therapeutic horseback riding changed their lives for the better. This book has the power to potentially help thousands of people in need connect to a therapy that will improve their lives and the communities in which they live.</p>
<p>There is no amount of money better spent that working to help people help themselves.</p>

If the goal is not met, I will continue the project through completion regardless. All funds will go toward that end and every penny will help me to reach the end project as soon as possible.
 
Be a part of a project that will give a hand up, not a hand out! Your contributions WILL make a difference to those in need. If you believe in the power of the human/animal bond, this is the project to support!
What makes me think I can successfully do this?
Most importantly it's because I know how this works and I have seen the miracles it has produced, both in physical results as well as internal growth and change. I also know I can do this because I started writing over 20 years ago, have completed and published a graduate thesis, numerous academic articles, more than a dozen articles published online, a recent article published in Arts & Understanding, not to mention the hundreds of technical writing projects and grants funded.

The Impact
Huge.
The key factor that keeps folks in need from this kind of treatment is that they simply do NOT know it exists. This book will compile the story of 10 - 20 riders who now have hope... who now know what successful treatment is all about... who faced their fears and now know what courage can bring to their lives. These are stories are about children who speak their first words on a horse, adults who are able to go back to work because they now have the core strength to sit up all day, and teenagers who learn to control their anger and have now developed healthy coping mechanisms. All of these stories are about how therapeutic horseback riding changed their lives for the better. This book has the power to potentially help thousands of people in need connect to a therapy that will improve their lives and the communities in which they live.
There is no amount of money better spent that working to help people help themselves.

<h3>A Bit About The Book:</h3>
</div>
<div>It started on Twitter, when the many of us who have been recipients of Sabrina's support over time found out she needed jaw surgery that her insurance company wasn't willing to pay for.

<p> </p>
<p>It’s been nearly three years since we first found out our daughter is really our son. But it was years before that when a suicide attempt introduced us to a world of struggles, with innumerable sleepless nights, endless fears and lots of tears. Our child did not wake up one morning and profess that he was a boy, not a girl. Rather, he endured depression, anxiety, bullying, and torment before he could put words to his inner struggle and understood that his gender identity was the source of his pain.</p>
<p>We confided in few people at first, then slowly surrendered our insecurities to instead arm ourselves with knowledge. The decision to embrace, rather than reject, our path transformed our lives. We supported our teenage son’s transition from female to male. Over the years, our family has transitioned along with him.</p>
<p>Many transgender people and their families went before us sharing their stories and helped us understand what it means to be transgender. Through their courage and insight, we learned how to best support our son and help save his life. Now, we want to give back and share our story.</p>
<p>We're Terri and Vince Cook from Central NY. Our memoir is written, and has been professionally edited. It will be published this summer. We have invested almost $10,000 and over 1,200 hours directly on the book. <strong>But we have a big plan and need your help. </strong>We want to raise at least $5,000 to finish publishing and promote the book. So, we're reaching out to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, we're offering to include you in our journey to raise awareness. Your contribution will get you a copy of our book and help us share our story.</p>

<p>Our son's struggle to understand, accept, and <em>simply be who he is</em> nearly cost him his life.  He had a family that loved and supported him, and yet it has been (and continues to be) a difficult journey.  Many of the fears and difficulties of being transgender (or having a transgender loved one) are compounded by the lack of awareness and acceptance in our society.  For this reason, we've decided to share our story ... with the hope of increasing awareness and bringing about change. We have come to understand that most people (including us at one time) have no idea what it means to be transgender or the challenges faced by transgender individuals.</p>
<p>This book is more than just a mile walk in our shoes because our son is transgender. It’s a story about how a young, middle-class family discovered how much they didn’t know. Our ignorance translated into fear, desperation, and pain. With a lot of help from others we learned the truth. We think everyone will benefit from the allies and angels in our life.</p>
<p>The poet Maya Angelou says, “When you know better, you do better.”</p>
<p>We hope that our story, and all of our efforts to publicize it, will help people to know better. We do believe in humanity, and we have no doubt that people will do better when they know better—regarding transgender people and all other marginalized populations.</p>

<p align=""center""><em>""Allies and Angels has an urgent message, but it does not tell you what to think—instead it shows, through the powerful, heart-wrenching narrative of a loving family, what a difference individuals can make in the lives of transgender youth.  I hope it becomes the go-to book for the parents of such kids, and that it inspires the same kind of compassion and respect shown by Drew’s family. It should be required reading for all who work with children and young adults of any gender. I’m a little older than Drew, but also grew up in the suburbs of Syracuse, New York and also came out as transgender in my teens. I faced many of the same issues, from big things like bullying and suicidal depression to so-called little things like the pain of school dances and old family photos. Although few struggles compare to being a young man in a female body, there still is little guidance available for these boys or their loved ones.  I wish such a book had existed for me and my parents during those difficult years and I hope this helps such families realize they aren’t alone. It will definitely improve, and most likely save, many young people’s lives.""<br/></em><em><strong>—</strong></em><strong>Elliott DeLine,<em> Author of Refuse<br/>and I Know Very Well How I Got My Name</em></strong></p>

<p align=""center""><em>""As someone who came out only six months ago at the age of 22, and whose parents are in the early stages of understanding and acceptance, this book was very emotional for me.   The Cook family’s story is so inspiring and heartfelt.  Thank you for making yourself vulnerable and writing this story so that others may find hope and come to better understand the experiences of trans* people and their families.  I can only imagine what my life would be like now had I had the strength, courage, and support that Drew had, in particular from his family and the Q Center, to come out at a younger age.  A great book for anyone to read – whether you’re trans*, you have family or friends that are, or you just want to learn a little bit more.""<br/></em><em><strong>—</strong></em><strong>Al Forbes,<em> Syracuse University graduate student</em></strong></p>

</p><p><b>Who am I?</b></p>
<p>My name is Tomeka M. Winborne. I am an author
and filmmaker. My first novel entitled, <i>Where My Strength Comes From</i>, was
published in 2005. In between working on my first book and sophomore novel, <i>I
Love Him But…</i> I began self-studying the art of filmmaking. I later realized
that I love creating but more importantly I love the art of storytelling. </p>
<p>Outside of the arts, I sell real estate. I also
love volunteering in the community. I am very vocal about equality and justice
for all people. Although, I think our political system is broken I still
believe that we should all exercise our right to vote because that is our
voice. However, I’ve decided instead of continuing to have useless debates; I
will use my creative juices to voice my opinions through my art forms going
forward. </p>
<p>I am passionate about many things but most
important to me is showcasing women in a positive light. I often pray that if
my work helps one person then I know its worth all the sacrifices that I’ve
endured as an artist. </p>
<p><b>What's it about?</b></p>
<p><i>I LOVE HIM, BUT</i>… is a dramatic novel that delves into
 the personal life of the main character, Cynthia Davis, who is by all 
standards a happy wife and a doting mother of a set of twin boys and a 
daughter. As the children are getting older and begin investing in their
 own lives, she realizes that much of her value was in them. This 
realization embarks her on journey to discover herself.  Although her 
husband Tony is an amazing man, during a tragedy in Cynthia’s life his 
business caused him not to be there to support her. While navigating 
through and around her emotions, she reconnects with an easygoing 
acquaintance that offers support that lightens the weight of a heavy 
situation. Cynthia bonds with two of her childhood friends as they 
initially covet the others marriages although each has a different 
conclusion to the sentence <i>I LOVE HIM, BUT...</i>  The ladies share support as
 they each travel down a rocky road to find happiness and love again. 
Cynthia finally reaches the point of balance and peace in her life, but 
not before all hell breaks loose.<br/></p>
<p><b><span>How's the book coming along?</span></b></p>
<p>The book is complete! I’ve finished several rewrites
and I’m definitely pleased with the outcome! Next, my editor and friend, Sarita
Scott, had me go through another round of rewrites after her notes. We were
both pleased with the final outcome of this novel. This is has been a long
journey but it is important to me that if you liked <i>Where My Strength Comes
From</i>, that you would love <i>I Love Him, But…</i></p>
<p>More importantly if <i>I Love Him, But…</i> is
your introduction to my work, I want it to be a great read for you. </p>

My name is Tomeka M. Winborne. I am an author
and filmmaker. My first novel entitled, Where My Strength Comes From, was
published in 2005. In between working on my first book and sophomore novel, I
Love Him But… I began self-studying the art of filmmaking. I later realized
that I love creating but more importantly I love the art of storytelling. 
Outside of the arts, I sell real estate. I also
love volunteering in the community. I am very vocal about equality and justice
for all people. Although, I think our political system is broken I still
believe that we should all exercise our right to vote because that is our
voice. However, I’ve decided instead of continuing to have useless debates; I
will use my creative juices to voice my opinions through my art forms going
forward. 
I am passionate about many things but most
important to me is showcasing women in a positive light. I often pray that if
my work helps one person then I know its worth all the sacrifices that I’ve
endured as an artist. 
What's it about?
I LOVE HIM, BUT… is a dramatic novel that delves into
 the personal life of the main character, Cynthia Davis, who is by all 
standards a happy wife and a doting mother of a set of twin boys and a 
daughter. As the children are getting older and begin investing in their
 own lives, she realizes that much of her value was in them. This 
realization embarks her on journey to discover herself.  Although her 
husband Tony is an amazing man, during a tragedy in Cynthia’s life his 
business caused him not to be there to support her. While navigating 
through and around her emotions, she reconnects with an easygoing 
acquaintance that offers support that lightens the weight of a heavy 
situation. Cynthia bonds with two of her childhood friends as they 
initially covet the others marriages although each has a different 
conclusion to the sentence I LOVE HIM, BUT...  The ladies share support as
 they each travel down a rocky road to find happiness and love again. 
Cynthia finally reaches the point of balance and peace in her life, but 
not before all hell breaks loose.
How's the book coming along?
The book is complete! I’ve finished several rewrites
and I’m definitely pleased with the outcome! Next, my editor and friend, Sarita
Scott, had me go through another round of rewrites after her notes. We were
both pleased with the final outcome of this novel. This is has been a long
journey but it is important to me that if you liked Where My Strength Comes
From, that you would love I Love Him, But…
More importantly if I Love Him, But… is
your introduction to my work, I want it to be a great read for you.

How I'm doing my part to change that image



First, I wrote a book entitled Fun House Chronicles (available on Kindle) which began the story of seniors compelled to enter a nursing home. The book deals with the hard truths of loss, illness and institutionalization, but the characters kick administrative butt, triumph over physical woes and find new ways to conquer life.


Now these characters are back in the Bear Jacobs series of mysteries. Retired P.I. Bear - plus his eWatsons Lily, Eunice and Charlie - live in adult care and spend their time solving crimes that slip beneath the notice of law enforcement. 

In Bear in Mind, the first of the PI Bear Jacobs series, the group investigates the case of Charlie’s missing wife. At first they think she’s a heart breaking bitch who abandons her hubby. But Bear learns that women in the community are disappearing at an alarming rate … and to no place good. Is a madman attacking older women, a la the Boston Strangler? Is a local crematory burning up the evidence? It’s a dangerous and twisted trail that Bear follows toward a surprising conclusion.

What I request from you
The funds I request will allow me to complete and market the first three books in the Bear Jacob series:



 Bear in Mind is brand new and online now as an Amazon Kindle Select book.
I have put myself on the financial line to fund its release as best I can. It is not enough.

Hard to Bear is half done and Bear at Sea is in synopsis form.

Your financial support is for the cover art and file conversions necessary to sell the books online. 
It is also for marketing the novels via social media and ebook promotions.
And if financial support is out of the question, I will certainly value your efforts to get the word out through your own social connections. 

Providing this series in paperback will be another project if sales of the ebooks live up to that potential.
Why Linda B. Myers, you ask
Others could do this series, sure. But I'm the one you've got, and my credentials are top notch:

Both my parents and my husband passed away in adult care facilities. I know a whole lot about the trials and triumphs of staff, caregivers and residents. I spent years observing it in action. That knowledge makes these books work.
I spent my whole career in marketing before writing novels; I know how to sell. 
I have had two books traditionally published (one of them in Turkish which is a whole other story). And I have self-published two more.
My reviews have been all 4 or 5 star.
If  you would like to read samples, my website is www.lindabmyers.com There you will find blog posts and excerpts from all my books. I suggest you take a look to know if your partner in this venture lives up to your standards.

www.facebook.com/LindaBMyers and www.twitter.com/lindabmyers are other locations to find me building an audience for my books. ""Like"" and ""subscribe"" and ""follow"" to help the potential audience for our investment to grow.
Risky BusinessWriters fail more than they succeed as business people. I could, too. But I've never lost anybody's money yet (other than my own from a few wild hunches).Know I will treat your investment with the respect such a gesture deserves. I will write about a society of seniors who may have lost a step physically but whose brains are sharp as bear claws. You will be proud of what your money has made possible.

<h3>Why We Are Reaching Out to You</h3>
</div>
<div></div>Thanks to the immense generosity and support of our contributors (and their publishers), we have been able to get this far without accruing many expenses. For us at Green Writers Press, this has been a labor of love; we have not paid ourselves a cent for our time editing, designing or promoting this book. But a book does cost money to put on the shelf; though most of our authors generously donated their work, we do have licensing fees to pay, as well as printing and publicity costs. As our publishing date approaches, we are now seeking funds to support those needs. Half of the $3000 we are asking for will support our printing and licensing costs; the other half will support our publicity campaign and Vermont book tour. The $3000 will by no means cover all of our expenses, but it will help us along the way!<div><br/></div>

<p>     “Calvin isn’t breathing.” Sarah cried into the telephone, “I
think I may have killed him. I…”</p>
<p></p>
<p>     Carol stopped her, “First. If he is dead; I am not sorry.
Second. I will not miss his abusive, worthless ass. Third. You did not cause
his death. You did not have control of the situation. You were not responsible.
So get a grip on reality and be calm. It is not your fault. I’m going to call
for help and then come over. If anyone comes to your house, except medical
help, keep them outside until I get there to take care of everything. It will
not be very long. I have to locate Jack and tell him what has happened and where I’m
going to be. Settle down. Just stay calm and I will see you in a few minutes.”</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">     </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Sarah's life changed from the control she had endured while married. Freedom to act as she wanted, dress as she wanted, go where she wanted, even laugh when she wanted. It moved from trying to hide and stop anger and jealousy directed at her in violence, to the simple act of choosing a brightly colored dress and applying make-up to shop at the grocery for food. Returning home without fear of another outburst of cruelty. </span></p>
<p>     Meeting Jon Bartleaux brings sexual awakening on a scale she had not experienced while she was with Calvin. Exciting, viberant, tingling, rewarding, unknown sex. Not the sex that gave gratification to only Calvin in a puritanical, repetitive single act, but imaginative, creative and enjoyable. Different in each act and experience.</p>     Her sheltered life of physical and 
mental abuse ended with the passing of her abusive husband. She
 finds previously unknown personal freedom and sexual experiences with  Jon, a wealthy businessman. He gives her freedom to act herself and expand her horizons. 
His medical advice affords her the capability to help a friend and her 
children gain freedom from abuse and the threat of contracted murder.
<p>     Sarah's relationship with Jon ends with his death and her life is 
changed when his wealth becomes hers. Love comes again with Richard 
Taylor and her sexual education continues to evolve. Her plan to 
free Twyla is accomplished and she accepts a new challenge, to relieve 
the suffering and danger in another woman's life.</p>

     “Calvin isn’t breathing.” Sarah cried into the telephone, “I
think I may have killed him. I…”

     Carol stopped her, “First. If he is dead; I am not sorry.
Second. I will not miss his abusive, worthless ass. Third. You did not cause
his death. You did not have control of the situation. You were not responsible.
So get a grip on reality and be calm. It is not your fault. I’m going to call
for help and then come over. If anyone comes to your house, except medical
help, keep them outside until I get there to take care of everything. It will
not be very long. I have to locate Jack and tell him what has happened and where I’m
going to be. Settle down. Just stay calm and I will see you in a few minutes.”
     Sarah's life changed from the control she had endured while married. Freedom to act as she wanted, dress as she wanted, go where she wanted, even laugh when she wanted. It moved from trying to hide and stop anger and jealousy directed at her in violence, to the simple act of choosing a brightly colored dress and applying make-up to shop at the grocery for food. Returning home without fear of another outburst of cruelty. 
     Meeting Jon Bartleaux brings sexual awakening on a scale she had not experienced while she was with Calvin. Exciting, viberant, tingling, rewarding, unknown sex. Not the sex that gave gratification to only Calvin in a puritanical, repetitive single act, but imaginative, creative and enjoyable. Different in each act and experience.     Her sheltered life of physical and 
mental abuse ended with the passing of her abusive husband. She
 finds previously unknown personal freedom and sexual experiences with  Jon, a wealthy businessman. He gives her freedom to act herself and expand her horizons. 
His medical advice affords her the capability to help a friend and her 
children gain freedom from abuse and the threat of contracted murder.
     Sarah's relationship with Jon ends with his death and her life is 
changed when his wealth becomes hers. Love comes again with Richard 
Taylor and her sexual education continues to evolve. Her plan to 
free Twyla is accomplished and she accepts a new challenge, to relieve 
the suffering and danger in another woman's life.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Young Writers Project is an independent nonprofit dedicated to the idea that writing is essential for learning, expression and creativity. Hate to write? We'll help with that. Think you're lousy at it? No problem; we'll show you the way. Think it's not important? We suspect you have something to say.</p>
<p>We work with kids online, in person and in schools; we publish their best work in 22 newspapers and on Vermont Public Radio each week; we hold events where they can present work live; we partner with anybody if we can get youths more audience for their fine work. And we work with hundreds of teachers to help deepen their students' engagement in writing.</p>
<p>YWP recently moved to the most economically challenged and diverse neighborhoods in Vermont to work with youths most in need of our help. We also believe these youths have stories to tell that must be heard.</p>
<p>Your support will help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy 10 laptops for our North by North Center -- it's a digital world and we need a few more work stations ;</li>
<li>Pay honorariums to area artists -- writers, musicians, digital storytellers, photographers, performers -- to lead vibrant exciting sessions for youths -- they need to live, too; and</li>
<li>Allow us to go out into neighborhood schools -- at no charge -- to work with teachers and students -- nothing breeds collaboration like the words, 'no charge.'</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of our work is done with intention: We want to help youths create work that is worthy of publication -- in newspapers, online, on stage, on radio or in our annual Anthology. We are going to focus on several projects aimed at helping youths write their stories in text, with images and other media or in a form that can be presented live. We anticipate several community presentations that will be streamed live online and will be recorded for viewing from anywhere.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of how your donations will be spent:</p>
<p>Computers. We will buy 10, last-year or refurbished Mac laptops for use in our North by North Center and for us to transport to other locations -- $7,500; </p>
<p>Honorariums. We would like to pay each artist $100 per two-hour session, including prep time. This hardly covers their true cost, but it helps. We will use these funds to match an anonymous donor to fund 30 weeks of workshops. $3,000 will be derived from this fund as a match; and</p>
<p>School Days. Your funding will help defray the costs of working with one school -- approximately 12 teachers and 400 students -- throughout the year -- our own digital platform for digital classroom space; ongoing mentoring of teachers; in-class workshops and support via phone, email and carrier pigeon when we can't make it to the school right away.</p>
<p>What you get out of this is tremendous satisfaction. OK. I hear you. But really, your donations will help us reach hundreds of youths to show them the power of their words, their stories.</p>
<p>And you will see their words. You will hear their voices. You will see their faces. And you will understand what it means to them.</p>
<p>We will have videos, live streams, Internet radio shows, pieces in the newspaper. You will see their work in our annual Anthology. And if you live nearby, you will meet them in person. And maybe, just maybe, for a few of them, you will say in 10 years, 'Well, I knew them when ...'</p>
<p>You will also get a tax deduction; they're nice, too.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There will be a real impact in what we do. Many of the youths we are serving are new arrivals, as they say. These kids were plunked down in the middle of winter from Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, Congo or Sudan, from Vietnam or Tibet or Indonesia, from Bosnia or Pakistan or India. Imagine for a moment; imagine if you were flown to Rwanda, with no knowledge of the language, no connections to the culture, few family members and not much money and each day you were asked to go to school and learn in a language that you didn't understand. Imagine. And imagine if you got to Rwanda via a four year journey that had you walking 1,000 miles on foot and living in refugee camps in three different countries with three different languages. And imagine, too, if you arrived in Rwanda and you could not really talk with anyone.</p>
<p>We hope that what we do is give voice to many of these youths and help them learn skills and create stories that have eloquence and power. We want those who read these stories, hear these stories, to understand.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that many of you don't have the money to give to our organization. We understand. And that is why we never charge youths for anything we do. But we'd love your help in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word. Send this link to your friends. Perhaps they can chip in.</li>
<li>And keep in mind this outfit here has all sorts of digitally acute ways of spreading the message; take advantage!</li>
<li>Suggest some ways we can give audience to their work other than what we are already doing.</li>
<li>And if you live in Vermont, give us a call and help us at the North by North Center -- help encourage some youth to participate; offer to give them some transportation to make it to our center; or just ask them to tell you their story.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A special word to you who made it this far...</h3>
<p>My name is Geoffrey Gevalt. I founded this organization after a 33-year career in journalism. Two things about that: One, I had a whole lot of help getting this started -- a bunch of business and education leaders gave me the seed money and lots of advice to get it started and hundreds of people have helped out since. Two, I always felt that in my career as a journalist, people who made it to the end of the story always deserved something extra. A little nugget, perhaps. So here it is.</p>
<p>I work 60 hours a week at this crazy job running YWP. On a good week, I stretch that out to seven days. On a not as good week I reach 60 by Friday. But I love every minute of it. Well, actually, not <em>every </em>minute. But darn close. Imagine how much fun it is to get kids to write and tell stories.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening. And thanks for your support.</p>

<p>Born and raised in North East New Jersey, I would have run away with the circus a long time ago if things were different, but instead have found myself a calling in performance poetry and advocacy.</p>
<p>I attended my first open mic in 2009 and never stopped.  A long time “page poet”, I self-released my first poetry anthology, <em>Everyday Life’s Inspiration</em>, through lulu.com the same year.</p>
<p>In 2012 I was the Jersey City Slam Women of the World Poetry Slam Representative Runner Up.  That year I was also in the 2012 Jersey City Slam Finals.</p>

<p> </p></div>","About SaraEve:
Born and raised in North East New Jersey, I would have run away with the circus a long time ago if things were different, but instead have found myself a calling in performance poetry and advocacy.
I attended my first open mic in 2009 and never stopped.  A long time “page poet”, I self-released my first poetry anthology, Everyday Life’s Inspiration, through lulu.com the same year.
In 2012 I was the Jersey City Slam Women of the World Poetry Slam Representative Runner Up.  That year I was also in the 2012 Jersey City Slam Finals.
I am currently the co-slammaster of Jersey City Slam, along with Ben “Broken English” Figueroa.  I also conduct the weekly Poetry Workshop For Women hosted by the Poetry Guild of Union City.

I totally agree that these tiny spirits, which come closer when we are on the right track, and sometimes disappear when we let routines, doubts and rationality dominate over love, manage our lives.</p><p>I’m leaning how to orientate myself on this feeling… I believe it’s better to change life without loosing it, then to stay in the rut and never know what is miracle – when the baby finds you and makes you better, that he or she can be born… I would recommend this book to all future mothers, no matter when this future will happen to them.</p><ul><li><i>Oxana Bistrova, Chelyabinsk<br/><br/></i></li></ul><p>It's a great book, without any excessive moralizing, without needless pain, but with a lot of joy.

This novel exceeded all of my expectations! Surprisingly enough it is easy to read and captivates with a fast-evolving plot.

I was penetrated with the frankness and sincerity.</p><p>By virtue of this book I believed in myself.

And straight away I could smell something. And my eyes opened – they were open slightly because I was very tired and through this tiny slit I saw the light and two creatures in blue. They were quick at helping me to get out of my sanctuary and putting me on something warm. Or rather on someone warm. This someone, I laid on, was curiously examining me. There were red veins as narrow as threads in her eyes and on her face.</span><br/></p><p>- Hi there – she addressed herself to me and slightly touched me with the point of her finger, as if she wanted to make sure I was real.</p><p>Well it looks like this is my mother, I thought to myself, while her eyes were scanning me. But why does she hardly remind me of that young woman I chose to be my mom when I was still flying? It might be that humans are changing. Giving birth is not an easy thing to do, I guess. Well it was hard for her… It’s ok, she’ll get some rest and fix herself and will become the most beautiful mum in the world. My Mother! Anyway I am supposed to love her just the way she is.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">- It’s two minutes after midnight – claimed those in blue clothes.</span></p><p>And then she talked to someone else standing next to her head.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">- What does your watch say? - she addressed him. I couldn’t see yet who was there.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">- Midnight and thirty seconds – man’s voice replied – Already thirty three seconds.</span></p><p>And then mother started to argue. I remember, she liked to argue when I was inside as well. Here we go again! It seemed like the precise time was important for her. She drew her attention away from me, and it was a little insulting.People in blue gave up quickly and put down what she was insisting on, then I was lifted and carried away somewhere. And my mom was left there… They were still doing something to her, and I got worried that maybe she was still in pain. I kept thinking of her. And – oh dear - I forgot her name. It seems to me that I actually forgot a lot, after coming into the light.</p><p>I had been washed for a long time; they scrubbed the muck of my belly for some reason, weighed me, and tied a tag with a note “Vorobyeva. Boy. 05/27. 00:00, 53 sm. 3650 grams”, then they swaddled me tightly and left me alone. But pretty soon someone in black approached me and pointed at me with a strange thing with round glass. I didn’t know what it was, but to be on the safe side I squinted. It was still hard to open my eyes. And then the man in black said in a low voice that I look like a tumorous old lady. I could hear that and got mad at him. Some kind of a fool he was. You are an old lady. Just wait, I’ll show you!</p><p>- So that is what you are: Danya, Phedya, Stepa… - mused someone in black.</p><p>No, that’s not my father, I thought. I know my father. And you are definitely not he. Well I did recognize my mom. So I would recognize my father as well, since I chose them, a long time before today.</p><p>Anyway, finally I was born. And it was entire and permanent. Now I have to live here. There won’t be warm water all the time, in which I stayed and sucked my finger, no more feeling of complete protection, no more opportunity to eavesdrop on adults’ conversations safely. And the saddest thing is that I will never fly again. I felt so sad at that moment that I wanted to cry. And I cried. But I was so tired that it came out as indistinct sob. No one understood that I’m crying because I’m sad. Apparently newborns are supposed to cry to let the world know about their birth.</p><p><br/>***<br/><br/>When I saw my mom for the first time she looked completely different. Although I didn’t look like anyone at all and for sure didn’t look like anyone’s grandma. But mom had ginger, copper-gold and curly hair. A really happy girl! Tanned, wearing blue jeans and a bright yellow top. She was laughing a lot. Together with some young man they were in the boat and chatting. The patches of sunlight were chasing each other on the water next to them. I was flying by with my friends, with other souls belonging to nobody. Our goal was to find those who will become our parents. I was looking for happy people, who loved each other. And all of a sudden I heard her laughter,</p><p>- That’s it, guys, go on without me! – I shout to my friends and sat dawn on her shoulder. She scratched it right away like she felt something. I probably tickled her although I was invisible. Human beings can feel such things from time to time. Our tickles for them are like a little bug creeping on a cheek<b>. </b>I looked into her laughing brown eyes and saw some warm and joyful feeling in it.</p><p>- It might be love and I’m on the right track then, am I? – Then I thought to myself. <br/>- So where are those monkeys,Victor? It seems that we are lost… - she said to her companion. <br/>– Don’t worry, Ginger, we are going to find them now!</p><p>They were looking for some island. I decided to stay with them and observe.<br/>They took turns rowing the boat.</p><p>- Take a picture of me, please, while I’m rowing. Am I beautiful – yes? - she laughed and leaned a little bit back. She was actually (or it was the way I saw her) very beautiful. It seemed that the flow of amazing sunny energy that was coming from her went right through me. I felt as if I looked like a sunbeam too. I might even become visible at that moment.</p><p>- I want you to be my mother – I whisper in her ear, and she scratched it. – Got ya!</p><p>I stayed with them that night. They finally found an island with monkeys, brought to the Central Park of Recreation and Leisure in the summer of 1999. After hand-feed the monkeys and turned back the boat thee laid on the grass for a long time, drinking beer and talking. I found out that girl’s name was Lera and that she lived not far from the subway station in Saint Petersburg called “Dibenko”. The name of the young man was Victor. It had been 2 months since they broke up, but a couple days ago he brought by Lera’s request some forgotten stuff from the apartment where they lived together. When they hadn’t seen each other, both started new relationships, but their reunion won’t let them become serious.</p><p>- Ginger, in fact you are practically my wife… - looking at her with love, he said and I could see that she was incredibly pleased to hear that. – We’ve been through so many things together! You were the only one who visited me in the hospital when I broke my spine and almost one month laid motionless… Yeah, everything was there!You know, I saw you last week andI haven’t been myself since then.I can’t concentrate on my work, I’ve beenniggling with one agreement for several days, my colleagues ask me what’s wrong with me… And yesterday I realized, that it’s love, Ginger! – He patted her curly hair. In spite of his words, I didn’t like Victor. I wouldn’t want a dad like him. He looked like a caveman with a strange shape of head and large ears. His face reminds me of a dwarf – evil, or kind depending on the expression of his eyes. But it wasn’t even about the way he looked. I felt something cold and cruel in his eyes, and couldn’t find any definition of that… It seems like it had a second face. I must help my future mom to find someone else. I wonder whom she was dating when this “caveman” called on her again? I would like to look at this other man.</p><p>***</p><p>95TH of July. It’s impossible, I knew it for sure. Nevertheless, it was folded with wooden cubes on the bookshelf in the room of my future mother, when I got in her apartment for the first time<b>. </b>Well, it looks like, she was an extraordinary girl, and I was about to experience different unusual events.</p><p>She was reading a book so enthusiastically that she didn’t even feel how I slightly tickled her behind her ear. It was just one of the ways to let her know about me. We can also send people messages, - the ones, that when they see it they shake their heads and say – it’s a sign! I sent it to my future mom recently on her way to work in the morning, when she was thinking about her relationships with Victor. Lera was looking out of the bus’s window, and I was reading her thoughts: “Why did we start it again... It wasn’t worth it: a broken cup will remain cracked. We are just following an old pattern –she sighed and snuggled her cheek to the windowpane, leaning on her hand – Who’d suggest what to do, would say for sure, if he is my man or not. The bus was just passing next to the huge billboard with headlines “Not yours!” Although it was just an antismoking social ad – but isn’t that a sign? And most importantly – truly, that’s I knew for sure. And she had felt the same way for a long time already. I noticed how suddenly the look in her eyes changed: from thoughtfully sad to surprised.</p><p>We also can come in a dream. When my future mom was carried away by the book she was reading and didn’t notice my touch, I got upset and decided to come in her dream. I will have to figure out which image I will appear.</p><p>I don’t have a name yet. I am a small light, like a breath of the air, soul,and the time has come to find my incarnation on Earth.I don’t remember my previous lives and don’t know if I had any at all. It’s just time to live among people, and for this purpose I have to find those who will become my parents. My number is B-04041999. “B” means that I have to be born as a boy, numbers – a date when I start to search for my parents.According to the rules, at the beginning boys choose their mom, and girls -dad. Besides me, thousand souls have exactly the same number and they got the same task on 4th of April 1999, but I already lost them. How long my search will last and when I will be born, as a baby boy is unknown.</p><p>Sometimes we have to arrange the first meeting of our future parents and take care of them so they don’t get lost before the main reason they met happen – conception. And sometimes we have to do vice versa: separate those who don’t match. As it was in my case. What can be done for family happiness! I was determined to help Lera to find the one who will be different. How? It cannot be predicted. Generally speaking, the one with whom she will have it all.</p><p>***</p><p>Lera’s been wanting a child for a long time now. I found out about it when she was talking to her girlfriend over the phone. She was pregnant when she was 18 years old, but having a baby on her first year of college with someone with who she couldn’t have serious relationship was too much for her.</p><p>Together with her friend, a medical student, being young, she tried to solve the problem with the help of some hormone injections, but it didn’t help. So, with the advice of another girlfriend who had just experienced the same situation, she went to gynecologist and told him everything. Gentle blue-eyed professor treated her as a daughter, petted her hair and told her to come next day with slippers and robe.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">- I’m afraid that the anesthesia is not going to work – the last thing she remembered saying when she was pregnant, and a smile of the anesthesiologist with wide shoulders in a reaction to her words.</span></p><p>Everything happened really fast and the soul of her daughter who recently found her shelter ended up being rejected. Trying not to look at the process of withdrawing her body she flew away to her friends. She had to cry out her broken hopes – she already fall in love with this young gay girl who even found out about pregnancy on the April Fool Day. At first the father of the future baby took this news as a joke. But when it turned out to be tough joke, the soul of her daughter had to admit that she didn’t make a right choice, at least she did it too early for her mother. For this kind of failure she had to wait another two years before choosing parents again.</p><p>At first when Lera saw babies she wanted to cry. Several times a little girl with ginger hair and grey eyes came to her dreams. Later, she felt this loss when she was holding her friend’s kids. While she was living with Victor, she wanted to be a mother so badly. The same year her friend became the mother of a baby boy, and according to her words, she saw him in a dream and he told her to give him the name Roma. Before his birth Lera visited her exactly on the 1st of April and as a joke told her to give birth on 17th, because it was her favorite number. It came as a big surprise when he was born on 17th.<br/><br/>–Now you know who has be his Godmother, don’t you? – She asked laughing</p><p>– Without any doubt. – Her girlfriend smiled - Once he grows up we will baptize him.<br/>– He will be my second godson. Someone told me recently that once you’ve become a godmother of a boy your life will change for the best. And I have 2 of them already!<br/>Then for sure it will be better from now on! – Anna said with confidence.</p><p>When the future Godmother, for the first time took one-month old Roma, and just for a second, imagined it was her baby – we got her request at the “celestial chancellery». And my soul, which was in search for two months, replied to this request right away.</p><p>This kind of requests usually happens when a woman sees a baby she likes. Something happens inside of her that is hard to explain – excitement, admiration that turns into a wish to have a baby. This signal is caught by the soul, who’s trying to incarnate on Earth, and from that moment they establish their own energy connection. I found Lera so naturally without even knowing that she was the one.</p><p>Coming back from her future Godson, the girl told Victor about her emotions. But their wishes were different. Victor, who was married once before and didn’t sign all papers yet, was 7 years older then his second civil wife. He considered himself experienced and practical, while Lera was young, naive and over emotional<b>. </b>Victor was generous, joyful and sometimes a joker, as well as cynical and despotic.</p><p>Lera thought sometimes that he had two persons inside of him: lighthearted joker, whom she loved, and practical cynic with the look that she truly feared. If astrology is to be trusted for Gemini this kind of bifurcation is normal. That second one considered Lera a little bit careless and a bad housewife; he didn’t plan to merry her and as a result didn’t want a baby. Point-blank. But since the first, bright half of his personality truly loved her, there was nothing left but to put up with this situation.</p><p>***</p><p>By the middle of the May, exactly when I felt that there is someone I need and that someone needs me<b>,</b> Victor and Lera’s relationship was close to the end. It wasn’t light and romantic any more, they were only dealing with everyday problems: what to buy for dinner, how small to cut onions, and during meal they only talk about work. There was no warmth. When it became absolutely intolerable, Lera packed her stuff while Victor was with friends. At the entrance she bumped into her former loved one and he silently followed her to the elevator.</p><p>One day later at the editorial office of the newspaper where she was working, a new cute young journalist Artem Golubkov has come, he was introduced to the team. The chief editor was showing the confused employee to all of the team members and asking them to be nice with the new colleague.<br/>– Sure we will! - Lera couldn’t hold herself from making a comment, noticing embarrassment of the new journalist. He was completely her type: middle height, grey eyes with a sweet squint and sexy lips, like Bred Pitt. Moreover he was very shy, it’s a big advantage too, she liked to confuse people. – We are very nice people, aren’t’ we, Artem? – She made him blush.</p><p>Artem smiled coyly and left the room as soon as possible. He цфы attracted to Lera immediately. He always liked girls with ginger hair but they were unfortunately not in his league. He got himself together and came onto the office again in ten minutes.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">- Does anyone want to go to the “DDT” concert tonight?

What if we chose our parents in order to fulfill our mutual destinies?
What if the spirit world was just as real and tangible as the physical world? 
What if we all came here upon our own choosing and selected the people and conditions that would be the most advantageous to the evolution of our souls?
The novel ""BORN!"" touches on all of these possibilities in a creative and captivating way. The story is told in the first person by a narrator – the invisible soul of a boy who chooses his future mother and does everything in his power to be born. This book is significant. It inspires young women to think about many considerable things like the fact that the life of the baby is important even before he/she is born.My name is Nadezhda Serebrennikova, I'm an author of ""BORN!"" I hope with your help we can translate this book into English and many young women and men will be able to read it. This book is poignant and thought-provoking and opens people’s eyes to seeing life and birth in an entirely new light and context.Everybody can believe in magic with ""BORN!"" Believe and realize that there is so much more out there than eye can see. Here are some reviews from people in Russia who have read my book.Right now I have just 8 pages in English and raise this amount to pay for translation and editing (I already have the professional translator who can do it). But I hope you can appreciate the idea if you start to read...***How many people actually ask the question “Where do babies come from?”…This book provides an absorbing, fascinating and surprisingly vivid and truthful answer to this question! I totally agree that these tiny spirits, which come closer when we are on the right track, and sometimes disappear when we let routines, doubts and rationality dominate over love, manage our lives.I’m leaning how to orientate myself on this feeling… I believe it’s better to change life without loosing it, then to stay in the rut and never know what is miracle – when the baby finds you and makes you better, that he or she can be born… I would recommend this book to all future mothers, no matter when this future will happen to them.Oxana Bistrova, ChelyabinskIt's a great book, without any excessive moralizing, without needless pain, but with a lot of joy. There is such indiscriminate forgiveness and such love, that the soul is starting to laugh. Thank you! Ksenia Orlova, Saint PetersburgAfter I heard only several phrases from this fairytale novel, I wanted to read it right away. This novel exceeded all of my expectations! Surprisingly enough it is easy to read and captivates with a fast-evolving plot. Most importantly, I was surprised that it is possible to write like this, in achildish naive way (clearly in a good way). I was penetrated with the frankness and sincerity.By virtue of this book I believed in myself. I believed that everything is possible and there is no need to stick to some certain rules, that it is possible to create new genres in literature, just don’t be afraid and do it sincerely. Thank you for “Born!”.Anastasia Senchenko, Voronezh***BORN!- The baby is coming by himself, by himself! - it was the first thing I heard. And straight away I could smell something. And my eyes opened – they were open slightly because I was very tired and through this tiny slit I saw the light and two creatures in blue. They were quick at helping me to get out of my sanctuary and putting me on something warm. Or rather on someone warm. This someone, I laid on, was curiously examining me. There were red veins as narrow as threads in her eyes and on her face.- Hi there – she addressed herself to me and slightly touched me with the point of her finger, as if she wanted to make sure I was real.Well it looks like this is my mother, I thought to myself, while her eyes were scanning me. But why does she hardly remind me of that young woman I chose to be my mom when I was still flying? It might be that humans are changing. Giving birth is not an easy thing to do, I guess. Well it was hard for her… It’s ok, she’ll get some rest and fix herself and will become the most beautiful mum in the world. My Mother! Anyway I am supposed to love her just the way she is.- It’s two minutes after midnight – claimed those in blue clothes.And then she talked to someone else standing next to her head.- What does your watch say? - she addressed him. I couldn’t see yet who was there.- Midnight and thirty seconds – man’s voice replied – Already thirty three seconds.And then mother started to argue. I remember, she liked to argue when I was inside as well. Here we go again! It seemed like the precise time was important for her. She drew her attention away from me, and it was a little insulting.People in blue gave up quickly and put down what she was insisting on, then I was lifted and carried away somewhere. And my mom was left there… They were still doing something to her, and I got worried that maybe she was still in pain. I kept thinking of her. And – oh dear - I forgot her name. It seems to me that I actually forgot a lot, after coming into the light.I had been washed for a long time; they scrubbed the muck of my belly for some reason, weighed me, and tied a tag with a note “Vorobyeva. Boy. 05/27. 00:00, 53 sm. 3650 grams”, then they swaddled me tightly and left me alone. But pretty soon someone in black approached me and pointed at me with a strange thing with round glass. I didn’t know what it was, but to be on the safe side I squinted. It was still hard to open my eyes. And then the man in black said in a low voice that I look like a tumorous old lady. I could hear that and got mad at him. Some kind of a fool he was. You are an old lady. Just wait, I’ll show you!- So that is what you are: Danya, Phedya, Stepa… - mused someone in black.No, that’s not my father, I thought. I know my father. And you are definitely not he. Well I did recognize my mom. So I would recognize my father as well, since I chose them, a long time before today.Anyway, finally I was born. And it was entire and permanent. Now I have to live here. There won’t be warm water all the time, in which I stayed and sucked my finger, no more feeling of complete protection, no more opportunity to eavesdrop on adults’ conversations safely. And the saddest thing is that I will never fly again. I felt so sad at that moment that I wanted to cry. And I cried. But I was so tired that it came out as indistinct sob. No one understood that I’m crying because I’m sad. Apparently newborns are supposed to cry to let the world know about their birth.***When I saw my mom for the first time she looked completely different. Although I didn’t look like anyone at all and for sure didn’t look like anyone’s grandma. But mom had ginger, copper-gold and curly hair. A really happy girl! Tanned, wearing blue jeans and a bright yellow top. She was laughing a lot. Together with some young man they were in the boat and chatting. The patches of sunlight were chasing each other on the water next to them. I was flying by with my friends, with other souls belonging to nobody. Our goal was to find those who will become our parents. I was looking for happy people, who loved each other. And all of a sudden I heard her laughter,- That’s it, guys, go on without me! – I shout to my friends and sat dawn on her shoulder. She scratched it right away like she felt something. I probably tickled her although I was invisible. Human beings can feel such things from time to time. Our tickles for them are like a little bug creeping on a cheek. I looked into her laughing brown eyes and saw some warm and joyful feeling in it.- It might be love and I’m on the right track then, am I? – Then I thought to myself. - So where are those monkeys,Victor? It seems that we are lost… - she said to her companion. – Don’t worry, Ginger, we are going to find them now!They were looking for some island. I decided to stay with them and observe.They took turns rowing the boat.- Take a picture of me, please, while I’m rowing. Am I beautiful – yes? - she laughed and leaned a little bit back. She was actually (or it was the way I saw her) very beautiful. It seemed that the flow of amazing sunny energy that was coming from her went right through me. I felt as if I looked like a sunbeam too. I might even become visible at that moment.- I want you to be my mother – I whisper in her ear, and she scratched it. – Got ya!I stayed with them that night. They finally found an island with monkeys, brought to the Central Park of Recreation and Leisure in the summer of 1999. After hand-feed the monkeys and turned back the boat thee laid on the grass for a long time, drinking beer and talking. I found out that girl’s name was Lera and that she lived not far from the subway station in Saint Petersburg called “Dibenko”. The name of the young man was Victor. It had been 2 months since they broke up, but a couple days ago he brought by Lera’s request some forgotten stuff from the apartment where they lived together. When they hadn’t seen each other, both started new relationships, but their reunion won’t let them become serious.- Ginger, in fact you are practically my wife… - looking at her with love, he said and I could see that she was incredibly pleased to hear that. – We’ve been through so many things together! You were the only one who visited me in the hospital when I broke my spine and almost one month laid motionless… Yeah, everything was there!You know, I saw you last week andI haven’t been myself since then.I can’t concentrate on my work, I’ve beenniggling with one agreement for several days, my colleagues ask me what’s wrong with me… And yesterday I realized, that it’s love, Ginger! – He patted her curly hair. In spite of his words, I didn’t like Victor. I wouldn’t want a dad like him. He looked like a caveman with a strange shape of head and large ears. His face reminds me of a dwarf – evil, or kind depending on the expression of his eyes. But it wasn’t even about the way he looked. I felt something cold and cruel in his eyes, and couldn’t find any definition of that… It seems like it had a second face. I must help my future mom to find someone else. I wonder whom she was dating when this “caveman” called on her again? I would like to look at this other man.***95TH of July. It’s impossible, I knew it for sure. Nevertheless, it was folded with wooden cubes on the bookshelf in the room of my future mother, when I got in her apartment for the first time. Well, it looks like, she was an extraordinary girl, and I was about to experience different unusual events.She was reading a book so enthusiastically that she didn’t even feel how I slightly tickled her behind her ear. It was just one of the ways to let her know about me. We can also send people messages, - the ones, that when they see it they shake their heads and say – it’s a sign! I sent it to my future mom recently on her way to work in the morning, when she was thinking about her relationships with Victor. Lera was looking out of the bus’s window, and I was reading her thoughts: “Why did we start it again... It wasn’t worth it: a broken cup will remain cracked. We are just following an old pattern –she sighed and snuggled her cheek to the windowpane, leaning on her hand – Who’d suggest what to do, would say for sure, if he is my man or not. The bus was just passing next to the huge billboard with headlines “Not yours!” Although it was just an antismoking social ad – but isn’t that a sign? And most importantly – truly, that’s I knew for sure. And she had felt the same way for a long time already. I noticed how suddenly the look in her eyes changed: from thoughtfully sad to surprised.We also can come in a dream. When my future mom was carried away by the book she was reading and didn’t notice my touch, I got upset and decided to come in her dream. I will have to figure out which image I will appear.I don’t have a name yet. I am a small light, like a breath of the air, soul,and the time has come to find my incarnation on Earth.I don’t remember my previous lives and don’t know if I had any at all. It’s just time to live among people, and for this purpose I have to find those who will become my parents. My number is B-04041999. “B” means that I have to be born as a boy, numbers – a date when I start to search for my parents.According to the rules, at the beginning boys choose their mom, and girls -dad. Besides me, thousand souls have exactly the same number and they got the same task on 4th of April 1999, but I already lost them. How long my search will last and when I will be born, as a baby boy is unknown.Sometimes we have to arrange the first meeting of our future parents and take care of them so they don’t get lost before the main reason they met happen – conception. And sometimes we have to do vice versa: separate those who don’t match. As it was in my case. What can be done for family happiness! I was determined to help Lera to find the one who will be different. How? It cannot be predicted. Generally speaking, the one with whom she will have it all.***Lera’s been wanting a child for a long time now. I found out about it when she was talking to her girlfriend over the phone. She was pregnant when she was 18 years old, but having a baby on her first year of college with someone with who she couldn’t have serious relationship was too much for her.Together with her friend, a medical student, being young, she tried to solve the problem with the help of some hormone injections, but it didn’t help. So, with the advice of another girlfriend who had just experienced the same situation, she went to gynecologist and told him everything. Gentle blue-eyed professor treated her as a daughter, petted her hair and told her to come next day with slippers and robe.- I’m afraid that the anesthesia is not going to work – the last thing she remembered saying when she was pregnant, and a smile of the anesthesiologist with wide shoulders in a reaction to her words.Everything happened really fast and the soul of her daughter who recently found her shelter ended up being rejected. Trying not to look at the process of withdrawing her body she flew away to her friends. She had to cry out her broken hopes – she already fall in love with this young gay girl who even found out about pregnancy on the April Fool Day. At first the father of the future baby took this news as a joke. But when it turned out to be tough joke, the soul of her daughter had to admit that she didn’t make a right choice, at least she did it too early for her mother. For this kind of failure she had to wait another two years before choosing parents again.At first when Lera saw babies she wanted to cry. Several times a little girl with ginger hair and grey eyes came to her dreams. Later, she felt this loss when she was holding her friend’s kids. While she was living with Victor, she wanted to be a mother so badly. The same year her friend became the mother of a baby boy, and according to her words, she saw him in a dream and he told her to give him the name Roma. Before his birth Lera visited her exactly on the 1st of April and as a joke told her to give birth on 17th, because it was her favorite number. It came as a big surprise when he was born on 17th.–Now you know who has be his Godmother, don’t you? – She asked laughing– Without any doubt. – Her girlfriend smiled - Once he grows up we will baptize him.– He will be my second godson. Someone told me recently that once you’ve become a godmother of a boy your life will change for the best. And I have 2 of them already!Then for sure it will be better from now on! – Anna said with confidence.When the future Godmother, for the first time took one-month old Roma, and just for a second, imagined it was her baby – we got her request at the “celestial chancellery». And my soul, which was in search for two months, replied to this request right away.This kind of requests usually happens when a woman sees a baby she likes. Something happens inside of her that is hard to explain – excitement, admiration that turns into a wish to have a baby. This signal is caught by the soul, who’s trying to incarnate on Earth, and from that moment they establish their own energy connection. I found Lera so naturally without even knowing that she was the one.Coming back from her future Godson, the girl told Victor about her emotions. But their wishes were different. Victor, who was married once before and didn’t sign all papers yet, was 7 years older then his second civil wife. He considered himself experienced and practical, while Lera was young, naive and over emotional. Victor was generous, joyful and sometimes a joker, as well as cynical and despotic.Lera thought sometimes that he had two persons inside of him: lighthearted joker, whom she loved, and practical cynic with the look that she truly feared. If astrology is to be trusted for Gemini this kind of bifurcation is normal. That second one considered Lera a little bit careless and a bad housewife; he didn’t plan to merry her and as a result didn’t want a baby. Point-blank. But since the first, bright half of his personality truly loved her, there was nothing left but to put up with this situation.***By the middle of the May, exactly when I felt that there is someone I need and that someone needs me, Victor and Lera’s relationship was close to the end. It wasn’t light and romantic any more, they were only dealing with everyday problems: what to buy for dinner, how small to cut onions, and during meal they only talk about work. There was no warmth. When it became absolutely intolerable, Lera packed her stuff while Victor was with friends. At the entrance she bumped into her former loved one and he silently followed her to the elevator.One day later at the editorial office of the newspaper where she was working, a new cute young journalist Artem Golubkov has come, he was introduced to the team. The chief editor was showing the confused employee to all of the team members and asking them to be nice with the new colleague.– Sure we will! - Lera couldn’t hold herself from making a comment, noticing embarrassment of the new journalist. He was completely her type: middle height, grey eyes with a sweet squint and sexy lips, like Bred Pitt. Moreover he was very shy, it’s a big advantage too, she liked to confuse people. – We are very nice people, aren’t’ we, Artem? – She made him blush.Artem smiled coyly and left the room as soon as possible. He цфы attracted to Lera immediately. He always liked girls with ginger hair but they were unfortunately not in his league. He got himself together and came onto the office again in ten minutes.- Does anyone want to go to the “DDT” concert tonight? I have a spare ticket. – Artem announced to all of them but looked directly at her.- Lera, you should go, you like Shevchuk. – One of her colleagues answered.- Shevchuk? I respect him, but I like Zemfira.- You can got to Zemfira next time. You should go, since you promised to be nice – giggled colleague.- Well, if only for that purpose … – Lera picked up – Ok, I will join you, Artem.It was very crowded, but for some reason they didn’t let people inside, so when they opened the door, the crowd tore inside, and young people were pushed against each other. But they didn't feel uncomfortable. Artem even thanked in his thoughts all the fans of Shevchuk for that, since he wasn’t ready to make that move by himself. Shevchuk was at his best. After the concert the crowd moved to the underground. Lera and Artem stood in the train face to face and both felt strong physical attraction.“So strange - Lera thought then – only yesterday I wanted to cry and one day later I am next to another man who is obviously attracted to me. And he is actually very cute, although it wouldn’t hurt him to shave …“- Why did you grow such a funny beard, you are only 23 years old? - Without any offence she asked him - We are almost of the same age by the way. You see I don’t have any beard.- I thought I would look more distinguished with it. It didn’t work?- No, it didn’t. Shave it!- I’ll think about it- Yes, you should think about it. Think about it and shave it!– Your tongue is sharp! – Artem said with admiration.– Yes, as sharp as the blade that you need to shave your beard with. – She laughed.Not knowing what to answer, he didn't find anything better then slightly pull her hair. Where was I at that moment? Why wasn't I around them? It was that perfect moment when everything could go either direction. No one was there to tell Lera that he was the one, and like it says in one song 'just don't let him go away'. No one was there to warn her that she shouldn’t discourage him. The guy was still as green as grass and she could make anything out of him. With the right approach he could become my real beloved dad. But Lera wasn’t a sculptor by nature, it wouldn’t hurt to polish herself a little bit first. And the material that this guy was made of would crack after the first burn. That’s why everything went wrong between them from the beginning …They went out several times after work in the company of their colleagues, trying to get to know each other. Lera started to have some feelings, but Artem being timid decided to go after her friend Julia, who coincidentally was with them that day. Lera was watching how the couple separated and after a few minutes he was already kissing Julia under the Lenin’s monument next to the Finland railway station.It wasn’t clear to Lera, what Artem was trying to get with this sort of behavior. Young guy with beard was trying to make her jealous that way and even share with her how he felt good about that kiss. Nevertheless the result was the opposite – Lera shrugged her shoulders and cross him out in his mind. And this spontaneous flirt with Julia was only one for Artem.***I was in Lera’s room and was watching how she looked at two pink stripes on thin piece of paper. I could feel her confusion and heard her thoughts. I wasn’t myself. I couldn’t understand how that happened, because I wanted Lera to understand before conceiving me that Victor is not her match. Now everything turned to be really complicated.“Dear God… what is Victor going to say when he wakes up?

He recognized Lera and at her request he tried to persuade the young man to keep the baby.- It’s about 5 weeks now. The uterine wall is too thin, abortion can negatively affect the future pregnancy, do you understand that? - He said to the future father in the hall after the checkup. Victor shook his head as if he did understand everything. The doctor winked at Lera as if he was saying that he hope everything would settle. She also wanted to believe it.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>ABOUT MY PROJECT:</strong></h3>
<p>My poetry manuscript <em>What Was Monumental in Us (WWMU)</em> focuses on five sites of the Mughal period (16<sup>th</sup> century to the 18<sup>th</sup> century) which are situated in present day Lahore (inner city). The work looks at how 21<sup>st</sup> century locals live amongst and interact with monuments that have been passed down to them. How do locals deal with the lineage of conquering invaders who may have shared some kind of faith with them, and most of territory? The buildings under discussion are massive in scale and their exteriors have changed as visitors have touched them, toyed with them, and in some cases desecrated them. The buildings' purposes have been altered not once but many times. Sites have been converted from elaborate sleeping chambers to administrative offices, from places of holiness to that of plunder. I am interested in examining how a person’s encounter with a building changes the building, and how a building’s encounter with a person changes the person. The people accommodating ancient structures in their midst, the city around the buildings changing, these are some of the preoccupations of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Lahore is a vibrant and joyous city and you can read more about some of its landmarks <a href=""http://zarminarafi.wordpress.com/2012/12/04/genesis-a-herstoriographyexcavation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>WHY POETRY? WHY LAHORE?</strong></h3>
<p>I was born in Lahore, Pakistan and moved to Toronto, Canada at age sixteen. In 2012, I was provided funding by the Ontario Arts Council to work on a project set in Lahore, Pakistan. I spent the summer of 2012 in inner city Lahore, researching, photographing, and talking with locals in order to figure out how best to shape my poetry manuscript  Since my return to Toronto in Fall 2012, I have produced sixty pages of writing and a blog about my experiences from the Summer. The written material so far does not suffice as a full-length manuscript. In fact the material is only the beginning of a larger exploration and creative process. This campaign attempts to raise funds towards the goal of doing something for the love of it: for the love of writing and for the love of a city I left long ago but am beckoned by once again.</p>
<p>As to poetry, thought esoteric by some, it certainly is an interest of mine. Further, the sites under discussion lend themselves wonderfully to thinking about a poetic milieu. It was under the Mughal administration of India that poets were patronised at the royal courts. Some of these poets went on to become founders of Classical Urdu poetry. Royal patronage having been made obsolete a long time ago, what better way for a modern day poet to raise funds than with the help of the driving machine of our time, the internet?</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://zarminarafi.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/14.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 219px; height: 308px;""/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>GOALS:</strong></h3>
<p>In order to view how the city changes through the cycle of seasons and to fully immerse myself in the culture of the place I plan to be in Lahore for ten months starting June, 2013. I estimate the cost of living and working for ten months at $10,000. I am initially attempting to raise approximately $4,000 through Indiegogo. I may be able to supplement the $4,000 with another arts grant, or with income saved between now and June, 2013. I will also be paying approximately $2,000 dollars for round-trip airfare which is not part of the estimated cost of living in my budget. If I raise only part of the funds I still plan to go on the trip but will have to shorten the duration of the trip. All contributors will receive perks as stated. Estimated completion date for a full draft of the manuscript is April, 2014.</p>
<p>To sum up, this campaign aims to generate funds which will:</p>
<p>1. Allow me to complete my first full-length poetry manuscript.</p>
<p>2. Allow me to begin an informal process of documentation of oral and public histories by interviewing locals of the inner city neighbourhoods I have been working in since early 2012.</p>
<p>The first goal is a personal goal and your support will allow me to present a full artistic rendering of what I have observed and encountered in my exchanges with architecture and with history.</p>
<p>The second goal is public, and in the long run perhaps its impact more significant than that of the first goal. I aim to document and create an archive of the locals’ stories and how they remember the history of buildings and neighbourhoods around them. Several of the buildings I refer to are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list as being crucial for cultural preservation. On an informal level no one knows about these buildings better than the people who continue to live with and around these buildings on a daily basis. Often the locals’ stories are overlooked or not considered important in official histories and surveys done by administrative departments at the government level. Although no one has commissioned me to take this side project on, this work is very important in order for us to have a documented history of a city which was built and re-built many times in the last thousand years. The impact of this work can be far reaching and I am determined at least to make a start so as to begin the process of research gathering via oral and collective means. To do this work is not a digression from my own project as I will simply be taking notes, listening, asking questions and observing in both cases.</p>
<p>I thank you for reading about my campaign and for being a potential supporter.</p>
<p>If you can’t contribute financially please consider spreading the word by sharing a link to my campaign page with your social media contacts. I appreciate all the support I can get!</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT YOU GET:</strong></h3>
<p>Below is a summary of perks offered through my campaign:</p>
<p>1. For a $10 contribution your name will be listed in the acknowledgements section of my published book. I will be happy to declare in print that some of the work completed was made possible with your financial support.</p>
<p><em>Get your name out there as a supporter of arts and culture!</em></p>
<p>2. For a $25 contribution I will send you a 6*8 high quality print of a scene from vibrant Lahore. The photo will be taken just for you and will be UNIQUE for each recipient. An electronic copy can also be mailed to the recipient and I am open to input on your choice of subject for the photo. Some examples of photos taken by me can be viewed at the campaign gallery.</p>
<p><em>Who doesn’t like getting a snail mail package from faraway? Especially one for which I may have dodged trucks, cars or possibly livestock just to have captured a rare image for you. </em></p>
<p>3. For a $50 contribution I will send you a unique print as described in perk #2. This print will come with an original text of minimum one paragraph. The text will be composed by me either in the shape of a poem or as a descriptive prose paragraph elaborating on the scene of the photograph. Again, the writing will be unique for each recipient.</p>
<p><em>Who doesn’t like getting a snail mail package from faraway? Especially one which contains an arresting photo and a tailor-made composition written just for you. </em></p>
<p>Again, thanks for reading and please consider supporting me.</p>

An electronic copy can also be mailed to the recipient and I am open to input on your choice of subject for the photo. Some examples of photos taken by me can be viewed at the campaign gallery.
Who doesn’t like getting a snail mail package from faraway? Especially one for which I may have dodged trucks, cars or possibly livestock just to have captured a rare image for you. 
3. For a $50 contribution I will send you a unique print as described in perk #2. This print will come with an original text of minimum one paragraph. The text will be composed by me either in the shape of a poem or as a descriptive prose paragraph elaborating on the scene of the photograph. Again, the writing will be unique for each recipient.
Who doesn’t like getting a snail mail package from faraway? Especially one which contains an arresting photo and a tailor-made composition written just for you. 
Again, thanks for reading and please consider supporting me.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Joanna Penn Cooper, and I'm a poet and writer of short fiction and essays.  I moved to New York City almost four years ago for a three-year teaching fellowship at Fordham University. During my time in New York, I have made friends in the local literary community, have published my creative work in literary journals, and have connected <span>with an inspired Brooklyn press whose editor is working with me to shape my first book </span><span>of lyrical shorts (think prose poems meet micro-fiction)</span>.  My full-time teaching position is now over, and for the past several months, I have been writing, applying for jobs, sending out my work, and patching together part-time teaching and freelance work, including a job as part-time researcher for the novelist Paula McLain.  </p>
<p>Here's the good news and the part I'm asking for help with:  I have been accepted to Vermont Studio Center, a well-known artists' colony, for a four-week residency starting May 13th, which will give me time to do final revisions on my book manuscript, tentatively titled <em>How We Were Strangers</em>.  So, I'm asking for help to fund this opportunity to revise my book in the enriching residency environment, surrounded by nature and by other artists.  Your donations will allow me to focus in a deep way on writing and revision, and will help me see my first full-length book into the world!     </p>
<p>To give you a sense of the voice in the book, you can watch the video above or read another piece here:</p>

<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>From Vermont Studio Center, I have received an Artist's Grant plus Work Exchange Award to off-set the cost of the residency, and after paying a $300 deposit, the remaining amount owed is $1,900.  I could also use help funding travel to the residency and off-setting the cost of my rent back in New York.  I'm asking for $2,700, as after fees, if I reach my goal, I would receive $2,511 of that.  If I reach that goal, I will pay back residency costs, and put the remainder toward my travel and living expenses.  If I reach a portion of the goal, I will pay for part or all of the residency costs.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>For donating certain amounts, you may claim the perks listed on the right (my writing services or copies of my creative work).  You may also donate without claiming any of the perks.  Even $5 will be met with my sincere gratitude!   </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will be my first full-length book, and the work I do in Vermont will go a long way toward seeing the manuscript to its final form.  The pieces in the book explore the liminal spaces between the prose and poetry, between the lyrical and the surreal, ultimately seeking to honor that which we share as human beings—mystery, humor, existential struggle, and a desire for understanding and love.   </p>
<p>My writing has received much positive attention in the past few years.  In December 2010, my manuscript was a finalist for the Kinereth Gensler Award from Alice James Books, and I have also been nominated for a 2012 Rona Jaffe Award for emerging women writers.  Publishing my book will widen my opportunities for full-time teaching positions.  And, basically, after years of hard work and development as a writer, I would love the opportunity to bring my work to a larger audience.        </p>
<p>In addition, time at the Vermont Studio Center will also enable me to do what every artist longs to do-- immerse myself in the work and make connections with other artists.  Two Distinguished Visiting Writers I admire will be in attendance during my time at VSC, Bernadette Mayer and Donald Revell, and I'll get the opportunity to discuss a short manuscript of my work with them.  In addition to revision of my existing manuscript, I will also work on new pieces for my second book of prose poems and lyrical prose, tentatively titled <em>Vita, </em>which will expand on my first book's themes of nomadicism, an appreciation for the absurd, and exploration of origins.   </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not in a position to contribute financially, believe me, I UNDERSTAND.  If you would like to contribute in other ways, I ask that you send good vibes my way, and that you pass along my campaign to others as you see fit on Facebook, blogs, Twitter, etc.   </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I’m a poet and
I’ve just completed a book-length environmental poem called <i>The Book of Grass</i>.
It looks at the world from the viewpoint of grass – and with 11,000 different
names for grass it’s a pretty big viewpoint – from rye to barley to bamboo to
lemon-grass to hairy-flowered woollybutt (I’m not joking!). </p>

a young, independent publisher in the UK. It’s owned by Martin Parker (one of
the editors of <b>Brittle Star magazine</b>) and it champions <b>new writing</b>. It
publishes <b>poetry</b> (including my own Earthworks pamphlet) and <b>short fiction</b> (with
a little <b>science fantasy</b> thrown in for good measure). </p>
<p>In the first few

<h3></h3><h3>What is the Purpose of This Project?</h3><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
</span></p><p>It is about helping young men and women feel more
comfortable in their own skin.</p>
<p>Your donation to this project will help us write a book to
help as many as youth understand most importantly the following important life lessons:</p>
<p>1. 
You are NOT a freak (even though we all feel
like it sometimes)</p>
<p>2. 
“Normal” is a lie</p>
<p>3. 
Understanding your “Natural State” is important
(using the Myers Briggs Type Indicator)</p>
<p>4. 
How to map your goals based on and understanding
of your “Natural State.”</p>
<p>We ask you to donate and help us bring this book, curriculum
to fruition and help as many youth as we can.</p>
<p>Our fundraising deadline is January 31<sup>st</sup>, we
would appreciate your donation between now and then to raise as much toward our
goal as possible.</p><p></p><h3>Here's the Skinny on Shawne and Bennie!</h3>
<p>Our names are Ben Wallace and Shawne Johnson.  We have each
been working and volunteering with youth for more than 15 years.  One
thing we have seen as a universal need among youth (and adults) is to better understand who they authentically are as
human beings.  </p>
<p>This
project stems from a labor of love to help youth find a method for better
understanding who they are, what they need, how to cope with, and hopefully thrive
in the chaotic and ever-changing world around them.  This is a need that
transcends gender, age, race, sexual orientation, or economic situation; it is
a natural human need to understand who you are and where you fit in the world.
 As our working title eludes to, a map is useless if you don't know which direction you are facing in relation to the world around you.  You need a ""Compass"" or a true idea of who you authentically are to help you head in the right direction.</p>
<p>This
book isn't about leadership, although we think leadership is important.
 This book is about using the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) as a
foundation for developing a better understanding of who each of our authentic selves is and how
that compares to the expected selves that we must become in various situations
(conforming to what parents tell you to do, fitting it with friends, at work, at school, in
relationships).  Some of the ""expected self"" roles are positive
and some are negative, but regardless we must understand how our emotional bank
accounts are affected when we are required to be someone different from our
""authentic self.""  We also need to understand how
to recharge and replenish our emotional bank accounts and in some cases even
learn new tools or behaviors that we an use to lessen the emotional cost of
adapting to our environment.</p>
<p>We believe that this book will be a powerful tool for helping youth and adults better understand why they are the way they are, and how to deal with the curve balls that life throws at them.  For many readers, this will be a chance to get to know themselves better.  However for youth and adults sometimes bewildered by or frustrated with the world around them, this understanding of how to care for their emotional needs and the process of developing an understanding of their authentic self could be the difference between thriving in life and giving up.</p>
<p>Along
with the book, we will be creating curriculum that will help organizations,
youth groups, work teams, and others better understand how to be more effective
individuals and team members with those around them.</p>
<p>We
want to help the world become a happier, successful place for as many people as
possible and we believe that this project will make a real impact in the lives
of people all around the world from all walks of life.  And we need your
help to make it happen.</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>What We Need and What You Get!</b></h3><p></p>
<p>We need your
help hitting our fundraising goal.  The money we raise will fund our
tuition to go through the MBTI Certification Program as well as the use of the
MBTI assessment to work with focus and target groups as we finish the book and
develop the curriculum. While we have a lot of experience with the MBTI
assessment, we feel strongly that our final product will be more effective and
better received if we have gone through the certification process.</p>
<p>You have the opportunity to get a
wonderful variety of perks ranging from being one of the first to get a copy of
the book all the way up to getting your name in the acknowledgements of the
book and even a personalized session to go through your Meyers Briggs
assessment results and look at how that knowledge can help you.</p>
<p>Haven't you ever wanted to have
your name in a book!?  Wouldn't you love to know more about yourself and
how your natural ""quirks"" could be working in your favor?</p>
<p>There are a range of perks and we
tried to make sure that there are perk levels that would be accessible to
everyone.  We appreciate any level of support that you can provide.</p>
<p>If for some reason we don't
attain our goal (which we are hoping won't be an issue) we will use the funds
we do raise to get as far in our efforts towards the certifications and final
product as we can.  We WILL get there, we just need your help to make it
happen inside of a decade... </p>
<h3>Helping to Make a Real Impact </h3>
<p>This
book has the potential to open up a perspective on who we are and how to
navigate the chaos of life that we don't feel has been discussed before.
 Some may have eluded to it, but we think our approach is valuable and
unique.  We aren't in this to get rich, we are in this to help improve the
lives and perspectives of as many people as we can.  </p>
<p>If
you have ever remembered a time in your life when you felt lost, this book is
for you.  If you have ever felt like the world was happening around you
and you couldn't understand why, this book is for you.  If you have ever
felt like you were a freak who didn't fit in and that you were the only one
that felt that way, this book is for you.  </p>
<p>Even
if you can't identify with any of the statements above (which we find highly
unlikely) know that there are millions of youth and adults who do feel like
this every day. If we are able to reach just one youth with this book and help
them make the decision that they are normal and worthy, then we have succeeded.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We
understand that not everyone can afford to give large amounts or maybe not any
at all.  Regardless of whether you are able to contribute to our campaign,
we would appreciate your help in sharing our message and our cause.  We
think that it is worthy of the few minutes it took you to read about it and
hopefully you are inspired to tell others about what we are trying to do.
 Thanks for your support!</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>The Salvation Shark is the story of Becki Murphy, a teen pop star disillusioned with her fame. She meets Anton Lazarus, who claims to be the Devil, and promises to make all her problems go away if she commits one justified murder.</p>
<p>Originally published in 2010-11 in Laugh at Yourself First, the Salvation Shark is making its way to print. That's where I need you. Your generous donation  will help cover the print costs, and the live appearances to support the book.</p>
<p>You can read the novel right now on your Kindle. It costs $5, but you can download the entire novel on your Kindle for free July 15th.</p>

<div>
<h3>How to Help</h3>
<p>I grew up punk rock and believe in DIY. I publish through printisbetter books, my indie publishing house. I write, edit, design, and format, and publish through CreateSpace. The Salvation Shark will be available in print through Amazon September 10th. Meeting my goal will help me produce a print run of 200 books to sell and distribute for reviews.</p>
<p>Donors of $50 or more will receive a copy a month prior to the release date. Donors of $100 or more will receive acknowledgment in the text. Donors of $200 will be thanked and receive a limited edition hardcover. There are more great perks on the sidebar. With everything, you get my deepest appreciation.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>The Salvation Shark is my third novel, after Here in This Sorrow in 2004 and Dollars Per Hour in 2005. Both were republished through my fiction blog, Laugh at Yourself First, which became <a href=""http://www.printisbetter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.printisbetter.com</a>. I believe in DIY art and Copyleft I enjoy ebooks because they allow me to give as much of my writing away at a minimal cost to both me and my reader. I think print is better, and I want books to be something special to be kept on the shelf for a generation.</p>
<p>Last year I published Danglehorn, my first book for children, about an elephant and rhinoceros that must work together to protect their land and food. I performed in schools and libraries across New York to elementary audiences excited to trumpet like an elephant and sign their name in a notebook made from elephant poop. I also write a monthly column in the legendary National Police Gazette, which was reborn in my hometown, Binghamton, NY., after 30 years of dormancy. The magazine is distributed free, and in addition to classic material, the NPG features sports, music, theater, politics, and crime. <a href=""http://www.policegazette.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.policegazette.us</a></p>
<p>In 2011 I starred in ""The Demon Messenger,"" a low-budget horror film about a group of activists that summon a monster to combat a ruthless oil company in Upstate, NY. Prior, I was president of Theatricks by Starlight and bringing from the page to the stage 19 original scripts, including my own, ""Sweet Chastity in Wonderland,"" ""The Legend of the Ghost of Dracula's Cook,"" ""Jack the Ripper Doesn't Exist,"" and the original ""Danglehorn.""</p>
<p>In my Day Job, I work as a school portrait photographer, putting me literally every day on stage under hot lights performing live for the most notoriously unpredictable audiences imaginable. Through this work, I've learned more about writing and live performance than any time in theatre. I enjoy promoting my writing through travel.</p>
<div>
<h3>Pass It Along</h3>
<p>In the words of Henry Rollins, ""I'd rather be read than paid."" I don't want to disuade you as a reader because you don't have anything to spare. Even buying an ebook will be a help, or wait for a free day. If you download my story free and lend it to a friend, Amazon will pay me. Maybe there is such a thing as a free lunch. Don't have a Kindle? I have several books in print through Amazon, or if you dig deep enough, you can find my blog, Laugh at Yourself First, where I published hundreds of stories free for the reading. If you enjoy, please tell a friend.</p>

</div></div>","Empowering Democracy through digital tools. In the wake of the economic crisis and in a
country where politics has all too often been beset by scandals and corruption,
Vouliwatch aims to help develop an open and accountable political system that
uses new digital technology to promote citizen participation in the political
process and to rebuild trust in parliamentary democracy. In the heyday of
Ancient Greek democracy, citizens actively participated in political dialogue,
and Vouliwatch aims to revive this essential aspect of a democratic society
through the use of digital technology.

How it actually works!Vouliwatch is a digital platform that offers
Greek citizens the opportunity to publicly question MPs and MEPs on the topic
of their choice, and to hold their elected representatives accountable for
their parliamentary activity. It is loosely modelled on similar initiatives
that are already running successfully in other countries (Ireland, Luxemburg, Tunisia, Germany, France and Austria).
Ask your MP and MEP

MPs and MEPs can post a public response to users' questions and comments,
bringing them closer to the citizens they represent and giving them the chance
to engage in public dialogue, learning what issues are close to their voters'
hearts and allowing them to better represent their constituencies. Each MP and MEP has a devoted page on the
website which details their CV, full contact details, committee activity and voting
behaviour. 
Crowdsourcing/bottom up approach
The platform also gives users the chance to
influence political debate and to focus the attention of both the media and the politicians on issues that citizens believe are important and are not being discussed

<p>I'm Kevin Patrick Sullivan co-founder and curator of the ANNUAL SAN LUIS OBISPO POETRY FESTIVAL/CORNERS OF THE MOUTH. I'm originally from Dearborn Hgts. Michigan, and I've lived here on the central coast of California since 1975. I'm a high school graduate and I'm a Grounds 1 at San Luis Coastal Unified School District here in San Luis Obispo where I have worked for the past 23 years.  I have enriched my life beyond measure, when I decided to become a poet in 1980 and then several years later co-founding a poetry festival and a monthly reading series. Over the years the community has been enriched as well. We have raised money for the local literacy and arts councils. We have worked with the California Arts Council, the City of SLO, Cal Poly University and Poets and Writers Inc.</p>
<p>Times are tough right now and I'm asking you to help me fund the 30th Annual SLO Poetry Festival for poet honorariums and funding for a literary journal titled <em>LANGUAGE OF THE SOUL A Celebration of 30 Years at the San Luis Obispo Poetry</em> <em>Festival</em>. I want to pay all the poets, except for the open readers participating a minimum of $100. The rest will go towards the journal. It will be a big book. Its contributors will come from the 30 years of the festival and even from the Corners of the Mouth, the monthly reading series I've held at Linnaea's Cafe in downtown SLO since 1984.</p>
<p>Your contributions will make real in the world, the many voices heard over the years, voices like Ray Clark Dickson, Glenna Luschei, Hernan Castellano Giron, Ann Candelaria, Lorna Dee Cerventes, Sam Hamill, Eavan Boland, Carol Muskie Dukes, Al Young, Clayton Eshleman, Eleanor Lerman and Nellie Wong to name just a few. This will be an extraordinary anthology of contempoary American Poetry. It will be a delight to hold in your hands, the words of the poet coming to life with your breath. This is what we can do together, we can make a beautiful book and a joyful noise. I do have experience in publishing and as an editor.  This will not be my first go around. Please be generous. </p>
<p>I'm asking for $10,000. The way I figure it I'll need at minimum $1,500 for the honorariums. That will leave $8,500 for the book. I'll need PDF files, book design and outright printing costs. There will be mailing costs for contributors copies and web site updating costs for selling the book on line. There will be advertising cost as well. Check out our website at <a href=""http://www.languageofthesoul.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.languageofthesoul.org</a>  </p>
<p>Look for us on Face Book at ANNUAL SAN LUIS OBISPO POETRY FESTIVAL / CORNERS OF THE MOUTH.</p>
<p>Every donation of $50.00 or more will receive a copy of the book once it is printed. My goal is to have the book published in time for the 31st ANNUAL SLO POETRY FESTIVAL next Noveber. Please help, small or large donations everything counts.  </p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal the 30th ANNUAL SAN LUIS OBISPO POETRY FESTIVAL will still go on, I guess I won't pay all the poets. I will publish the anthology perhaps it will be a smaller version. It will be availble for the 31st ANNUAL SLO POETRY FESTIVAL and everybody who contributed $50.00 or more will get a copy of the anthology.</p>
<p>Please donate, and know that you have helped bring into this world a work of beauty. A wonderful poetry anthology that celebrates a time and place.

Communities are built by nesters—those who settle, and in settling come to deeply know, love, and care for the place they have settled into. Our book seeks to foster and deepen that fundamental commitment.      Mutual Relief Building, Kentucky Street and Western AvenuePart rambling walking tour, part voyage to the past, he book is divided into three parts: the native Coast Miwoks, the working landscape of farms and ranches, and the river town. Particular locations have been selected with the aim of expressing the watershed’s unique beauty, both in the natural and the built landscapes, and the strong sense of place the watershed has provided for generations.Holstein cows, Spring Hill RoadBeautifully designed by designer and artist Laurie Szujewska, On a River Winding Home is a book that you will want to display on your coffee table long after you’ve finished reading it, both to share with friends as well as to remind yourself of what a fascinating, dynamic place the Petaluma River Watershed is.Volpi's Ristorante, Washington and Keller StreetsA limited edition of the book has been published in a  hardcover, coffee table format of 8 3/4 x 12 inches.

<p>It doesn’t begin with Culloden. History is seldom so neat and precise that a single event can be identified as the start or end of a thing. Rather, Culloden was a hinge, a point at which events changed direction, when the door to the past was closed and one to a very different future opened.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(Draft of the book cover)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi! I'm Jakub, a <strong>classical musician from Warsaw, Poland</strong>. Big fan of Bach, Mozart and John Williams. Because of the latter, I've been huge fan of Star Wars classical saga, since being... 8 :)</p>
<p>I grew up in the country behind the Iron Curtain – we could see there the Star Wars Original Trilogy in cinemas, but we couldn't buy the <strong>original Kenner action figures</strong>. What a loss for kids!</p>
<p>Luckily, we had good copyists in our country. They were making unlicensed toys all over the 1980s, and we – the kids – played with those copies.</p>
<p>Today, those <strong>bootleg copies </strong>are much sought after by modern collectors. I am one of them. Actually, I am the owner of one of <strong>three of the biggest and most complete collections</strong> of vintage Polish Star Wars figures in the world. About 1/4 of all existing figures (ca. 4800 are known today) went through my hands during last 11 years. That inspired me to write – in English – a book about them, to pay hommage to a phenomenon that could have been born only in this place, those times. Thanks to generous contribution of my fellow collectors, this book summarizes the today's knowledge about the topic. Now You can help this book to be released.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(Five examples of Polish Yoda figures from ca. 1986)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The action figures I describe in the book are not only the collector's trophies to me. This is my <strong>childhood memories</strong> enchanted in little rubber artefacts as well as the history of my home country. To release this book is to give those items, those memories, that history an<strong> immortal shape</strong>. I have no doubts, that not many publishers are interested in ordering such collector's guide, that's why I am releasing it privately, taking all the risk. I worked hard for <strong>last two years</strong>, making pictures, editing them, writing articles, measuring the figures, consulting the doubts, creating layout... Now the time has come for the stage of proofreading and upcoming printing, which will cost a lot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being a supporter of this campaign is being a contributor of the <strong>historical release</strong>, a book extremely rare and interesting not only for a focused specialists, but for any Star Wars fan or toy collector. This is not just a book. This is first ever book of this kind. Let's make it together!</p>

<p>Two costs have to be paid on this stage of the project:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Proofreading </strong>(native American).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Printing </strong>(200 copies).</p>
<p>This, including campaign fees, will take as much as <strong>USD 3300</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am offering <strong>exciting perks</strong> for your support! Just look at them:</p>
<p>- <strong>your name</strong> could be mentioned in the Backer's Section of the book</p>
<p>- you can order <strong>a copy</strong> (or more) of the book in special price, shipped</p>
<p>- you can get a promotional <strong>t-shirt</strong>, full of happy Polish Yoda figures</p>
<p>- you can become an owner of a grail: original <strong>vintage Polish Star Wars figure</strong></p>
<p>- but you can also get<strong> one of my albums</strong>, including nice Bach's music :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Don't worry, if I don't get the entire sum I need, I will release the book anyway. I just need a tiny help. A feedback, that my hard work is important to some of you :)</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Far Far Away is an unique book, first printed guide to very attractive collectibles. Collectors, but not only them, will find it interesting.

Hi! I'm Jakub, a classical musician from Warsaw, Poland. Big fan of Bach, Mozart and John Williams. Because of the latter, I've been huge fan of Star Wars classical saga, since being... 8 :)
I grew up in the country behind the Iron Curtain – we could see there the Star Wars Original Trilogy in cinemas, but we couldn't buy the original Kenner action figures. What a loss for kids!
Luckily, we had good copyists in our country. They were making unlicensed toys all over the 1980s, and we – the kids – played with those copies.
Today, those bootleg copies are much sought after by modern collectors. I am one of them. Actually, I am the owner of one of three of the biggest and most complete collections of vintage Polish Star Wars figures in the world. About 1/4 of all existing figures (ca. 4800 are known today) went through my hands during last 11 years. That inspired me to write – in English – a book about them, to pay hommage to a phenomenon that could have been born only in this place, those times. Thanks to generous contribution of my fellow collectors, this book summarizes the today's knowledge about the topic. Now You can help this book to be released.
 

(Five examples of Polish Yoda figures from ca. 1986)
 
The action figures I describe in the book are not only the collector's trophies to me. This is my childhood memories enchanted in little rubber artefacts as well as the history of my home country. To release this book is to give those items, those memories, that history an immortal shape. I have no doubts, that not many publishers are interested in ordering such collector's guide, that's why I am releasing it privately, taking all the risk. I worked hard for last two years, making pictures, editing them, writing articles, measuring the figures, consulting the doubts, creating layout... Now the time has come for the stage of proofreading and upcoming printing, which will cost a lot.
 
Being a supporter of this campaign is being a contributor of the historical release, a book extremely rare and interesting not only for a focused specialists, but for any Star Wars fan or toy collector. This is not just a book. This is first ever book of this kind. Let's make it together!

(That's just me, keep scrolling.)
 
 

Two costs have to be paid on this stage of the project:
1. Proofreading (native American).
2. Printing (200 copies).
This, including campaign fees, will take as much as USD 3300. 
 
I am offering exciting perks for your support! Just look at them:
- your name could be mentioned in the Backer's Section of the book
- you can order a copy (or more) of the book in special price, shipped
- you can get a promotional t-shirt, full of happy Polish Yoda figures
- you can become an owner of a grail: original vintage Polish Star Wars figure
- but you can also get one of my albums, including nice Bach's music :)
 
Don't worry, if I don't get the entire sum I need, I will release the book anyway. I just need a tiny help. A feedback, that my hard work is important to some of you :)
 
 

The Impact
Far Far Away is an unique book, first printed guide to very attractive collectibles. Collectors, but not only them, will find it interesting. It concerns the subjects connected with the most influencing movie saga in the history. Any Star Wars fan will have a good time while reading this book!
 

 
(Example of the page layout.)
 
The book will be in B5 format (176 x 250 mm or 6.9 x 9.8 in), hard cover, counting 208 glossy pages, full of high resolution colour pictures (over 1000 of them), with detailed description of about 350 figures. 90% of them come from my archives, the rest is a kind contribution of my friends collectors, such as Jason Harrison-Edge, Daren Wilde, Andy Anderson, Trevor Wencl, Roger Ferm, Kim Zoll and many many others. Each described figure will be measured (height and weight) and graded (count and value).

(Book content.)
 
It will be printed soon after this campaign ends. I hope to see the book released on late December. That means you may order a copy as a late Christmas present! I will start shipping them in January. After you get a copy, you will get your own, virtual, complete set of Polish Star Wars figures, with many variants, standing right on your shelf :)

<h3>Our March Into Summer</h3>
<p>We have so much planned for you. As we continue to roll out our monthly editions focusing on topics that matter to Queer People of Color, we want to give you a preview of what you'll help bring about.</p>
<p>Many new and established publications and digital media companies get by on demanding free labor, and even not paying their writers and editors. This is especially true for media in the people of color and LGBTQ markets. But EFNIKS pays, and we will always pay. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>JUNE: SPACES</h3>
<p>In June, we're focusing on the concept of ""safe spaces"" for LGBTQ People of Color. We're asking where we find safe spaces, and whether spaces that are supposed to be safe for us really are what they claim to be. Are gay bars safe spaces? First responders? Churches? Pride marches? Mental health professionals? College campuses? Dating apps? If they are indeed ""safe spaces"", it begs the question: for whom? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>JULY: AUDIO</h3>
<p>AUDIO has us looking at music, queer artists of color, and the sounds we go to when we're in a mood. Who are the LGBTQ artists of color we should know? What are the mainstream tracks that are the best of 2017 so far? What are monthly or weekly queer parties where we can hear the music we want to hear? Give us playlists, artists, the songs that mattered to you growing up and growing fine. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>AUGUST: FEMME</h3>
<p>This month we'll be celebrating queer women, femme gay men, and the gender non-binary / non-comforming. We'll be looking to their voices, asking how they navigate the LGBTQ landscape, and how they deal with all things FEMME as People of Color. We also want to hear from cis and masc presenting men on how they confront toxic masculinity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>SEPTEMBER: TOUCH</h3>
<p>In September, we want to give you all things ""sex positive"". We want to look at sexual health, sexual enjoyment, subcultures, consent, and what it means to ""do it right"". We want to talk to experts, the experienced among us, and see how we can share what we know and feel to give us all a path to better enjoyment of our bodies in common. </p>
<h3>EFNIKS Media</h3>
<p>Launching at the start of summer, EFNIKS Media is the place where we support and promote podcasts, video, and short film, all made by LGBTQ People of Color. Some will be EFNIKS Originals. Some will be distributed by EFNIKS. Some will be featured and supported. All will help promote the mission of this space, that representation matters, that LGBTQ People of Color matter. </p>

</div>
<h2>Synopsis and Campaign Info</h2> <p>Transformation Park is a crowdfunded transformation-themed ebook. The guests of Transformation Park have no idea that they'll be transformed by the magic of the rides, attractions, and concession stands - and you can decide which ones they visit, as well as request your own!</p>
<h3>Outline</h3>
<p>Different zones of Transformation Park will have different types of attractions, complete with all kinds of transformations. When you support Transformation Park at the Attendee level or higher, you get a custom character, who then enjoys whichever zone (or specific attraction) you'd like! The more people sponsor specific zones, the longer and more detailed those zones will be. </p>
<p>Transformation genres can include weight gain, gender change, age regression or progression, muscle growth or loss, demi-human (vampire, werewolf, mermaid, ogre, succubus, ect.) cultural changes, personality changes, and much, much more!<br/></p>

I'll post regular updates as to what's garnering support, and include custom zones and attractions so that they can get extra support too! I'll also announce stretch goals which will involve even more transformation themed fun. With that in mind, here are the areas of the park...</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Zones of Transformation Park</h3>
<div>There are currently five zones of the park: Fairy Tale Land, Future Land, Transformation Island, Circus Tent, and Food Trucks. Each of these attractions won't exist until someone sponsors them, so if you love a concept, become an attendee.</div>
<h4><b>Fairy Tale Land</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>In fairy tale land, every ride tells the story of a classic fairy tale. But those who hop on board the ride find themselves sucked into the fairy tale itself, forced to live out a transformation-themed version of the story. Fairy Tale Land could feature...</p>
<p><b>The Little Mermaid: </b>Mermaid transformation with a gender-bender twist...<br/><b>Hansel and Gretel</b>: Weight gain and witches, what's not to love?<br/><b>Snow White</b>: Age progression spells will abound...<br/><b>Cinderella</b>: How about a reverse makeover instead? Social class downgrade, plus weight gain.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Future Land</b></h4>
<p>Come see the future - today! All attractions are science fiction themed. Future Land could feature...</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Time Machine Experience: </b>An interactive video presentation on time travel could have some age progression or age regression related consequences...<br/><b>Digital Disco: </b>A giant dance hall where music causes mass transformations. Want to turn everyone into Punks? Nerds? Bimbos? Change their sexuality or gender? You pick the music, you choose the change.<br/><b>Alien Roller Coaster</b>: Encounter extra-terrestrials when you blast off to space. What kind of aliens, and what they want to do with humans, is entirely up to you.<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 24px;background-color: initial;""><br/>Transformation Island</span></p>
<div>A new addition to Transformation Park, Transformation Island is an off-coast retreat with darker, scarier themes. Transformation Island could feature...<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/><b>Monstrous Grotto: </b></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">What's in those caves behind the waterfall? It's the perfect setting for a dark, monstrous-type transformation. Pick the type of monster you'd like (and any other transformation you'd like them to have) and I'll do the rest.</span>
</div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Haunted House: </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Have a thing for weight-stealing vampires? Zombie bimbos? Age progression ghosts? Whatever it is, let me know, and they'll feature in the house of scares.</span>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Circus Tent</h4>
<p>Traditional amusement park attractions with a transformation twist. The Circus Tent could feature...</p>
<p><b>Funhouse Mirror: </b>Reflections can be deceiving. The mirror causes people's appearance and personality to drastically distort in any way you'd like.<br/><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Kissing Booth: </b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What if a simple kiss could change everything about you? Pick the change, and you'll get a kiss - and maybe a little more...<br/></span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Test your Strength: </b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A classic carnival game that involves a hammer. Perfect for muscle growth or muscle transfer.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Food Trucks</h4>
<p>Serving all sorts of food that causes all kinds of changes. The focus on Food Trucks is erotic descriptions of eating. Weight gain is certainly a strong possibility here, but any other transformation you'd like is also on the menu.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<div>
<h4></h4>
<h3></h3>
<h2>Pledge FAQ:</h2>
<div>Q: I'm confused - should I pledge at the Attendee, Gold Pass, or Platinum Pass<b>?<br/><br/>Attendee</b>: Best if you'd like to support an existing attraction from the list above. <br/><b>Gold Pass</b>: Best if you'd like to create a new idea that fits well into an existing land - like a Beauty and the Beast themed Fairy Tale attraction, or transformation-themed fortune teller in the Circus Tent.<br/><b>Platinum Pass:</b> Best if you want your own zone, and an entire chapter in the story dedicated to  your ideas, with however many attractions and characters as you'd like. An example would be requesting a Super Hero Stadium, where park patrons become transformation-themed heroes or villains. <br/>
</div>
<div>Q: How long a story will I get?<br/><br/><b>Attendee:</b> the length of the story will depend on how much support each zone gets. The more support, the longer the story. <br/><b>Gold Pass</b>: Your story will start out at around 2,000 words, but may be significantly longer if another backer decides to support it.<br/><b>Platinum Pass</b>: You'll have an entire chapter dedicated to your custom zone. Minimum 5,000 words, but may be significantly longer if another backer decides to support it.</div>
<div>The goal for Transformation Park is to have existing stories get longer with additional support - in other words, quality over quantity. <br/><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Q: If I pledge at the Attendee level, can I say what happens to my character?<br/></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A: You can decide what kind of character you'd like, one attraction you'd like them to visit, and a transformation that fits with that attraction.

<h3>Tell us a little more about yourself.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I first started writing stories online when I was 16 years old. A natural introvert, I felt it was difficult to find people who understood me. When I posted my first story, I suddenly felt like I had a way to connect with people that was punishingly elusive elsewhere. The passion of writing is a force that gives my life meaning, and I've never looked back.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why did you write the book?</h3>
<p>I've written two other crowdfunded stories: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Transformation-Mall-T-F-Wright-ebook/dp/B00XVGAEQA/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Transformation Mall</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01APBVN5E/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Transformation TV</a>.  Both of these projects were huge successes, and I'd highly suggest checking them out if you'd like to see what this kind of project will look like.</p>
<h3>What was your inspiration for the book?</h3>
<p>I took a trip to an amusement park recently and I enjoyed the way each area had a different theme. I thought that might be a way to have many different kinds of stories fit into one collection.</p>
<h3>What do you plan to do with the funds you raise?</h3>
<p>When I first started writing over ten years ago, writing was just a hobby and I wrote very sporadically. Thanks to my fans, I've been able to make writing my full-time job. Since writing is my only source of income, the money will go to support my living expenses so I have time to give the story the attention it deserves.</p>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What if you don't hit the goal?</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>I'll still release a few few short stories based on this theme. The more funding, the more ideas I can put into the story, and the better it will be. </p>

</div><p></p></div>","Update: We've all the stretch goals! Announcing New Stretch Goals:

Transformation Park closes at the end of the day on May 31st, and thanks to your support, we've hit every single one of my original stretch goals. So here are some more!$1000 - Super Size - I'll increase in length and detail whichever attraction has the most support!$1100 - Boat Ride - The ferry to Transformation Island will be full of surprises. $1200 - Super Size II - I'll increase in length and detail whichever attraction has the second most support!$1300 - Transformation Fireworks A finale at closing time. Witness the post-transformation reactions to the display!$1400 - Super Size III - I'll increase in length and detail whichever attraction has the third most support!

Synopsis and Campaign Info Transformation Park is a crowdfunded transformation-themed ebook. The guests of Transformation Park have no idea that they'll be transformed by the magic of the rides, attractions, and concession stands - and you can decide which ones they visit, as well as request your own!
Outline
Different zones of Transformation Park will have different types of attractions, complete with all kinds of transformations. When you support Transformation Park at the Attendee level or higher, you get a custom character, who then enjoys whichever zone (or specific attraction) you'd like! The more people sponsor specific zones, the longer and more detailed those zones will be. 
Transformation genres can include weight gain, gender change, age regression or progression, muscle growth or loss, demi-human (vampire, werewolf, mermaid, ogre, succubus, ect.) cultural changes, personality changes, and much, much more!
If you'd like to have an entirely custom idea, you can do that too through the Gold Pass or Platinum Pass! I can then add it to the park guide, giving others the chance to support your area of the park. See Pledge Info and Zones below for more information.


Pledge Info

If you pledge at the Attendee level, T.F. Wright - the author of the My Transformations website and many bestselling transformation themed ebooks - will include your character in the park, experiencing an attraction of your choice. The specifics of the plot will be a surprise!
If you pledge at the Gold Pass level or higher, you'll get a custom short story about your own attraction in Transformation Park! You can choose multiple characters, the plot, and the transformation. Each new attraction will be part of an existing zone.
If you pledge at the Platinum Pass level or higher, you'll get your own entire zone, with as many characters and attractions as you'd like! 
Attractions which receive more support will get a longer and more detailed section of the story. I'll post regular updates as to what's garnering support, and include custom zones and attractions so that they can get extra support too! I'll also announce stretch goals which will involve even more transformation themed fun. With that in mind, here are the areas of the park...

The Zones of Transformation Park
There are currently five zones of the park: Fairy Tale Land, Future Land, Transformation Island, Circus Tent, and Food Trucks. Each of these attractions won't exist until someone sponsors them, so if you love a concept, become an attendee.
Fairy Tale Land

In fairy tale land, every ride tells the story of a classic fairy tale. But those who hop on board the ride find themselves sucked into the fairy tale itself, forced to live out a transformation-themed version of the story. Fairy Tale Land could feature...
The Little Mermaid: Mermaid transformation with a gender-bender twist...Hansel and Gretel: Weight gain and witches, what's not to love?Snow White: Age progression spells will abound...Cinderella: How about a reverse makeover instead? Social class downgrade, plus weight gain.

Future Land
Come see the future - today! All attractions are science fiction themed. Future Land could feature...
Time Machine Experience: An interactive video presentation on time travel could have some age progression or age regression related consequences...Digital Disco: A giant dance hall where music causes mass transformations. Want to turn everyone into Punks? Nerds? Bimbos? Change their sexuality or gender? You pick the music, you choose the change.Alien Roller Coaster: Encounter extra-terrestrials when you blast off to space. What kind of aliens, and what they want to do with humans, is entirely up to you.Transformation Island
A new addition to Transformation Park, Transformation Island is an off-coast retreat with darker, scarier themes. Transformation Island could feature...Monstrous Grotto: What's in those caves behind the waterfall? It's the perfect setting for a dark, monstrous-type transformation. Pick the type of monster you'd like (and any other transformation you'd like them to have) and I'll do the rest.


Haunted House: Have a thing for weight-stealing vampires? Zombie bimbos? Age progression ghosts? Whatever it is, let me know, and they'll feature in the house of scares.


Circus Tent
Traditional amusement park attractions with a transformation twist. The Circus Tent could feature...
Funhouse Mirror: Reflections can be deceiving. The mirror causes people's appearance and personality to drastically distort in any way you'd like.Kissing Booth: What if a simple kiss could change everything about you? Pick the change, and you'll get a kiss - and maybe a little more...Test your Strength: A classic carnival game that involves a hammer. Perfect for muscle growth or muscle transfer.

Food Trucks
Serving all sorts of food that causes all kinds of changes. The focus on Food Trucks is erotic descriptions of eating. Weight gain is certainly a strong possibility here, but any other transformation you'd like is also on the menu.





Pledge FAQ:
Q: I'm confused - should I pledge at the Attendee, Gold Pass, or Platinum Pass?Attendee: Best if you'd like to support an existing attraction from the list above. Gold Pass: Best if you'd like to create a new idea that fits well into an existing land - like a Beauty and the Beast themed Fairy Tale attraction, or transformation-themed fortune teller in the Circus Tent.Platinum Pass: Best if you want your own zone, and an entire chapter in the story dedicated to  your ideas, with however many attractions and characters as you'd like. An example would be requesting a Super Hero Stadium, where park patrons become transformation-themed heroes or villains. 

Q: How long a story will I get?Attendee: the length of the story will depend on how much support each zone gets. The more support, the longer the story. Gold Pass: Your story will start out at around 2,000 words, but may be significantly longer if another backer decides to support it.Platinum Pass: You'll have an entire chapter dedicated to your custom zone. Minimum 5,000 words, but may be significantly longer if another backer decides to support it.
The goal for Transformation Park is to have existing stories get longer with additional support - in other words, quality over quantity. Q: If I pledge at the Attendee level, can I say what happens to my character?A: You can decide what kind of character you'd like, one attraction you'd like them to visit, and a transformation that fits with that attraction. The exact plot is a surprise.Q: If I pledge at the Attendee level, do I have a totally unique character?A: Yes, if that's important to you. Please specify if you'd like anything specific about your character.Q: If I pledge at the Gold Pass level, can I have a custom story written about an existing attraction? A: Yes. You don't need to create a new attraction if you don't want to.Q: If I pledge at the Gold Pass or Platinum Pass level, can I request that my section of the park be private?A: If you'd prefer not to have the area of the park be listed to help garner more support, then yes, you can request that it be private.Q: If I pledge at the Gold Pass level, can I have my single story happen in new zone I just came up with?A: Please suggest an attraction which fits the theme of an existing zone, or get the Platinum Pass for your own zone.Q: Can I request my custom character be a real life celebrity, or involve a copyrighted character?A: No, since Transformation Park will be published, fan fiction is not possible. We can do fictional characters which are different but inspired by real life.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Nushu Voices <i>LLC</i> was formed on 3/29/17 to curate, edit, and publish women's secret stories anonymously but the concept and plan to share great stories began years ago. I seek seed funding to launch the business and set up a fully functioning site to make it a reality. Many events and experiences inspired the launch of Nushu Voices. A Terry Tempest Williams book first introduced me to Nushu, or ‘woman’s writings’, a secret script developed by illiterate Chinese women. I attended Yoni Ki Baat, and listened to women's stories that used the healing power of humor to temper pain. I lost my Grandma and wondered about her untold stories. I wrote and struggled to express my own hard truths, and joined the historic Women’s March with my teenage daughter. I continued to reflect upon the power of women’s voices.</p>
<p>I thought about the challenges that women face in communicating our stories. We often edit ourselves or silence our voices when we imagine an audience.</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Única </strong>es una trepidante novela de acción paranormal que aporta un soplo de aire fresco al género <i>new adult</i>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">La vida corriente de Irina se rompió cundo un sueño la envolvió en un nuevo mundo repleto de magia, seres fantásticos y peligros a los que jamás hubiera pensado tener que enfrentarse.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Solo ella, junto a sus compañeros: Derek, un poderoso hechicero; Anais, una mestiza misteriosa; Elda, una preciosa aprendiz; y Saúl, un vengativo licántropo. Podrán evitar que el oscuro pasado de la organización llamada Guardianes de la Brecha marque el futuro con los errores de otro tiempo.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy os presentamos a <strong>Olga Gort</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacida en el otoño del año 1995 en un pequeño pueblo del oeste de Cataluña, su interés por la escritura y el mundo editorial la llevó a estudiar preimpresión en artes gráficas y diseño y edición de publicaciones impresas y multimedia, para luego seguir especializándose en el mundo de la literatura con el grado de estudios literarios en la universidad de Barcelona.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Escribió el primer borrador de la novela <i>Única </i>en el año 2014 y lo corrigió varias veces, modificando su título hasta dar lugar a la obra publicada.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Saúl no se molestó en aparcar bien; se quitó el casco y lo colgó descuidadamente en el manillar. Estaba delante del bloque de pisos donde vivía Irina, pero no parecía haber nada fuera de lo común. Fue hasta la entrada a paso ligero y la encontró abierta, de modo que empezó a subir escaleras. Todas las puertas que llevaban a los pasillos estaban cerradas a excepción de la del tercer piso. Cuando entró, vio al chico de esa mañana frente a una de las puertas; tenía el pelo y la ropa sucios de sangre seca y le observaba con una sonrisa.<br/>          ―Saúl, ¿verdad? Dargo y esa chica te están esperando, entra, por favor.<br/>          ―¿Y si antes de entrar te matara?<br/>          Marco sonrió y, dirigiéndole una mirada divertida, le respondió:<br/>          ―Dargo no tendrá suficiente paciencia.<br/>          Sin darse cuenta, Saúl soltó un gruñido amenazador y entró en el piso. Dargo estaba en un salón, junto a Irina, quien, con los ojos vendados y las manos atadas, aguardaba, completamente paralizada, al borde de la terraza a la que habían arrancado la barandilla. Al verlo llegar, Dargo le dedicó un saludo.<br/>          ―¿Vienes para convertirte en su héroe o por mí? <br/>          Saúl miró a Irina, estaba temblando por el miedo, deseando que todo terminara de un modo u otro. Sin embargo, hasta el momento de llegar frente al edificio y sentir su aroma, ni siquiera había sabido que era su casa, no, él no era el héroe del cuento.<br/>          ―Vengo a por ti.<br/>          La sonrisa de Dargo se hizo más ancha y abrió la terraza.<br/>          ―Me siento halagado.<br/>          Dargo se acarició la cicatriz. Saúl volvió a gruñir, esta vez más fuerte.<br/>          ―Te mataré.<br/>          Dargo rio alegremente y señaló a Irina.<br/>          ―Hagamos un trato.

Única es una trepidante novela de acción paranormal que aporta un soplo de aire fresco al género new adult.

Solo ella, junto a sus compañeros: Derek, un poderoso hechicero; Anais, una mestiza misteriosa; Elda, una preciosa aprendiz; y Saúl, un vengativo licántropo. Podrán evitar que el oscuro pasado de la organización llamada Guardianes de la Brecha marque el futuro con los errores de otro tiempo.
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy os presentamos a Olga Gort.
Nacida en el otoño del año 1995 en un pequeño pueblo del oeste de Cataluña, su interés por la escritura y el mundo editorial la llevó a estudiar preimpresión en artes gráficas y diseño y edición de publicaciones impresas y multimedia, para luego seguir especializándose en el mundo de la literatura con el grado de estudios literarios en la universidad de Barcelona.
Escribió el primer borrador de la novela Única en el año 2014 y lo corrigió varias veces, modificando su título hasta dar lugar a la obra publicada.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«Saúl no se molestó en aparcar bien; se quitó el casco y lo colgó descuidadamente en el manillar. Estaba delante del bloque de pisos donde vivía Irina, pero no parecía haber nada fuera de lo común. Fue hasta la entrada a paso ligero y la encontró abierta, de modo que empezó a subir escaleras. Todas las puertas que llevaban a los pasillos estaban cerradas a excepción de la del tercer piso. Cuando entró, vio al chico de esa mañana frente a una de las puertas; tenía el pelo y la ropa sucios de sangre seca y le observaba con una sonrisa.          ―Saúl, ¿verdad? Dargo y esa chica te están esperando, entra, por favor.          ―¿Y si antes de entrar te matara?          Marco sonrió y, dirigiéndole una mirada divertida, le respondió:          ―Dargo no tendrá suficiente paciencia.          Sin darse cuenta, Saúl soltó un gruñido amenazador y entró en el piso. Dargo estaba en un salón, junto a Irina, quien, con los ojos vendados y las manos atadas, aguardaba, completamente paralizada, al borde de la terraza a la que habían arrancado la barandilla. Al verlo llegar, Dargo le dedicó un saludo.          ―¿Vienes para convertirte en su héroe o por mí?           Saúl miró a Irina, estaba temblando por el miedo, deseando que todo terminara de un modo u otro. Sin embargo, hasta el momento de llegar frente al edificio y sentir su aroma, ni siquiera había sabido que era su casa, no, él no era el héroe del cuento.          ―Vengo a por ti.          La sonrisa de Dargo se hizo más ancha y abrió la terraza.          ―Me siento halagado.          Dargo se acarició la cicatriz. Saúl volvió a gruñir, esta vez más fuerte.          ―Te mataré.          Dargo rio alegremente y señaló a Irina.          ―Hagamos un trato. Si la dejas caer a ella, te daré la oportunidad de hacerlo. Sin embargo, estamos en un tercer piso. ¿Crees que sobrevivirá?          Saúl dio un paso hacia Dargo, diciéndose a sí mismo que antes de que pudiera tocarla ya lo habría matado.          ―No me importa.          Cuando terminó la frase, Dargo empujó a Irina bruscamente, haciéndola caer al vacío. Antes de que pudiera pararse medio segundo a pensarlo, Saúl saltó tras ella. Irina no era un licántropo; no era un monstruo. Si se golpeaba desde esa altura, moriría. La envolvió con su cuerpo para protegerla y, cuando llegó al suelo, ahogó un grito de dolor. Sintió como su brazo derecho se rompía con un crujido escalofriante. Le costó más de lo que había previsto reunir las fuerzas necesarias para incorporarse pero, tras un breve instante de vacilación, consiguió hacerlo y además quitarle la venda que cubría sus ojos. El verlo pareció tranquilizarla; tenía los ojos llenos de lágrimas»
