<p></p> <ul> </ul>Hallo, ich bin Karsten, 48 Jahre alt und ich bin ein bekennender ""Freidenker"" und daran ist meine Oma schuld.<br/><br/>Ich
 hab schon als Kind meine Oma gefragt ""Was ist eigentlich meine 
Bestimmung?"" und die grossartigste Oma der Welt sagte ""Das kann man nie 
wissen."" und ich fragte dann weiter ""Und wenn ich dagegen ankämpfen 
will, was meine Bestimmung ist?"" daraufhin entgegnete die klügste Frau 
die ich je kennenlernen durfte ""Dann ist das Deine Bestimmung"".<br/><br/><b>Eine Kampagne für das Leben</b><br/> <img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438090147/alva0bj1gf63un0dgg6o.jpg"" hspace=""10"" src="""" style=""width: 195.037px; height: 239px;""/>Meine Kampagne ist definitiv eine Kampagne für das Leben und gegen Ängste und Beschränkungen. Eine Kampagne für meine Bestimmung, die ich, dank Omas weiser Worte, inzwischen tatsächlich herausgefunden und gefunden habe: <i>Menschen zusammenbringen</i>. Ich war zuvor schon 7 Jahre lang Gastronom mit einer eigenen Bar, wo es vortrefflich funktioniert hat. Freundschaften und Pärchen aus der Zeit gibt es noch heute, und das macht mich zufrieden und glücklich.<br/><b><br/>... und darum geht's</b><br/><i>Ich brauche Dich!</i><br/><br/>Und es ist absolut wörtlich und ehrlich so gemeint. Ich brauche Dich, Deine Unterstützung, sogar finanziell, Deinen Glauben an mich, Dein Vertrauen in mich. Obwohl wir uns vielleicht gar nicht kennen. Verrückte Welt, oder? :)<br/><br/><b>... und es wird noch verrückter</b><br/>Ich brauche Dich, um mir meinen Traum zu erfüllen. Witzigerweise enthält das ""mir meinen Traum erfüllen"" ein kleines Hintertürchen für Dich, um Dir evtl. auch Deinen Traum erfüllen zu können! Klingt verrückt, ist es auch, macht aber Spass! :)<br/><br/>Ich erklär das mal so:<br/><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438090509/ojd9nce0edalfcfsjv7e.jpg"" hspace=""10"" src="""" style=""width: 236.761px; height: 246px;""/>Stell Dir vor, Du (also alle Crowdfunder zusammen sind jetzt ""Du"") gibst mir Geld, damit ich mir ein Haus mit Grundstück in Spanien mieten kann, um meinen Traum zu leben (Details dazu kommen natürlich noch). Ich steig einfach aus aus diesem ""Deutschland-Bus"" und rette meine Welt. Eine Welt retten will doch auch jeder von uns, schon als Kind, spätestens seit der ""Unendlichen Geschichte"" auf Fuchur's Rücken durch die Strassen fliegend, oder?<br/></p>
Indem ich also mit Deiner Hilfe (also der Crowdfunding-Gemeinschaft) meine Welt rette, biete ich Dir automatisch und direkt die Möglichkeit an, Deine Welt, wenn sie denn verbessert werden möchte, auch zu verbessern. Alle Crowdfunder zusammen, errichten also eine neue gemeinsame Welt in der sie jederzeit Platz nehmen können! Immernoch verrückt, oder? Dann sind wir auf dem richtigen Weg.<br/><br/>Kurz gesagt: Wenn ich ein Haus in Spanien habe, dann hast Du auch eins! Und mit 
Deiner Unterstützung (egal in welcher Höhe, irgendwas ab 1€), sicherst 
Du dir direkt die Unterkunft dort, für einen Besuch bis zu 10-14 Tagen, wann immer Du reinschneien magst! Das Prinzip ""jeder gibt soviel er mag und kann"" sollte überall funkionieren.<br/><br/><b>... das kommt Dir spanisch vor?</b><br/>Zunächst einmal eine kurze Erklärung: Warum Spanien?<br/>Spanien
 unterscheidet sich in vielem von Deutschland, für ein autarkes 
Leben ist vor allem aber das Wetter wichtig. Viel Sonne, ganzjährig am 
besten, sorgt dafür, dass man auch nahezu ganzjährig anbauen und ernten 
kann. Das ist eine einfache und logische Entscheidung. Es müsste gar 
nicht Spanien sein, es gingen auch Länder wie Italien, Griechenland, 
Portugal usw., aber ich möchte eben gern nach Spanien, weil ich dort 
bereits Freunde habe und ein Bekannter von mir dort ein ebensolches 
Projekt inzwischen erfolgreich aufzieht (und ich dadurch auf seinen 
wundervollen und wertvollen Erfahrungsschatz zurückgreifen kann!) und 
weil meine Tochter spanisch spricht. :)<br/><br/><b>... jetzt mal ""Butter bei die Fische""</b><br/><p>Nur zwei Beispiele:

In welchem Ort das dann genau sein wird kann ich natürlich noch nicht exakt sagen, aber die ""Costa Blanca"" sollte nicht weiter als 30 Minuten Autofahrt, oder einem Umkreis von 60KM, entfernt sein, das ist der Plan. Damit hast Du einen ungefähren Überblick, über das ""wo in Spanien"".<br/><br/>Auf diesem Streckenabschnitt, in einem Radius von ca. 60KM um Alicante herum, suche ich das Haus mit Grundstück.

<br/>Der ""Traum vom eigenen Leben"" will ja eigentlich gar kein Traum sein. Er 
will real sein. Er will aus Dir herausplatzen dürfen, ohne Ängste und 
Beschränkungen. Wetten?<br/><br/>Aus mir platzt heraus, in Spanien ein 
Grundstück mieten zu können, die ersten Monate zu überstehen und dann 
relativ befreit von den üblichen Zwängen einer modernen Gesellschaft in 
einer Gemeinschaft leben zu können, die dasselbe sucht. Dabei soll ein 
funktionierender kleiner Wirtschaftskreislauf geschaffen werden, der das
 Leben sichert. Das ist mein Traum. Deinen Traum würde ich gerne 
erfahren, wenn Du mich in Spanien besuchst, wir am Lagerfeuer sitzen und
 selbst angebautes Gemüse essen.<br/><br/>In Spanien sind die Grundstücksmietpreise gerade in ländlichen Gegenden 
rapide gefallen. 1000m² und mehr für bereits ab 400€ mit einem winzigen 
Häuslein, 800€ für gute 2000m² oder mehr und einer kleinen Finca. Diese 
Preise sind aktuell und real.<br/>
</div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>Was du mir gibst &amp; was du bekommst</h3>
<i>Was Du mir gibst</i>, entscheidest Du. Nutzen werde ich es für die Umsetzung meines Traumes: Mieten eines Grundstückes mit Haus und Grundlagen für die Selbstversorgung schaffen. Das betrifft sowohl Lebensmittel, als auch Geräte und Materialien.<br/>
<br/><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Was Du bekommst</i>, wird nahezu einzigartig sein. Ausser dem guten Gefühl, etwas bewirkt zu haben, wirst Du ganz konkret von mir nach Spanien eingeladen! Du sorgst nur für die An- und Abreisekosten, für den Rest sorge ich, wenn Du in diesem wundervollen Umfeld eines befreiten Lebens zurechtkommst. Schau Dir meine ""Perks"" auf der rechten Seite genau an, sie stellen bereits Deine Versorgung vor Ort sicher, wenn Du Dich beteiligst!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">""Jeder Euro zählt!"" ist nicht nur eine Floskel. Jeder Euro bewirkt tatsächlich bereits etwas: Davon kann ich Samen kaufen, einpflanzen und die Ernährung sichern!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Je mehr Euro zusammenkommen, desto mehr Vielfalt, desto mehr Menge und eine gesicherte Miete.<br/></p>
<p>Je mehr Menge, desto grösser die Chance die Überproduktion weiter veräussern zu können, dafür kann man sich auf den üblichen Märkten einen Stand mieten, das machen die Einheimischen nicht anders.</p>
<p>Je mehr Einnahmen, desto angenehmer das Leben in ""Be complete!""</p>
<p>Und jetzt kommt's: Je mehr Einnahmen, desto mehr werde ich in die Lage versetzt, Dir bei deinem eigenen Traum helfen zu können, wenn es soweit ist!

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Was passiert, wenn die 5000€ nicht erreicht werden?</b><br/>Dann dauert es mit der Vielfalt vielleicht einfach nur etwas länger, das Haus oder Grundstück wird vielleicht etwas kleiner sein, oder schon etwas älter. Aber ""jeder Euro zählt"", ist wirklich so gemeint. Ich gehe durchaus mit etwas Kapital nach Spanien, die Anreise, eine gewisse Zeit leben, ein Grundstück finden, all das kann ich von dem was ich mitnehme erreichen. Für alles danach, wenn das Grundstück gefunden ist, brauche ich Dich! Das heisst: Die Einladung nach Spanien steht in jedem Fall! Ich hoffe ich darf dich irgendwann dort begrüssen.<br/></p>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<h3>Leben auf dem Grundstück - Be complete!</h3>
Das Konzept von ""Be complete!"" als autark bestimmtes Leben liefert die Lebensqualität, die ich mir wünsche. Wenn Du mich dabei unterstützen magst, kannst Du jederzeit hineinschnuppern und auch herausfinden, ob Dir dasselbe gefehlt hat wie mir.<br/><br/>Ebenfalls ist jeder willkommen und gern gesehen, der einfach mit anpacken mag, der einfach mal etwas anderes erleben möchte, oder sogar auch den Einstieg in den Ausstieg sucht.<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risiken &amp; Herausforderungen</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;""> Die Herausforderung besteht hauptsächlich darin, ein funktionierendes, autarkes System mit Wirtschaftskreislauf zu errichten. Spanien ist wegen des ganzjährig recht guten Wetters schonmal bestens geeignet für den Anbau von eigenen Lebensmitteln, was in Deutschland nur schwierig ginge, bzw. oftmals nur klein gewachsenes Gemüse hervorbringt und auch nur zu bestimmten Monaten möglich ist.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Es werden also Gärten angelegt, Samen gepflanzt, Äcker bestellt und irgendwann geerntet. Mit Fehlschlägen muss gerechnet werden. Wetterumschwung, Mehltau, Blattläuse und so weiter können über die Ernte hereinbrechen. In der Regel wird hier aber meist nicht alles komplett befallen oder vernichtet. Dann heisst es einfach: Nochmal von vorn. Bei den oben genannten Preisen für Samen aber keine so grosse Hürde. Ich bin da sehr ehrgeizig und zielstrebig, etwas zum Laufen zu bringen, was auf den ersten Blick vielleicht noch nicht so richtig hinhaut. Eigene Gärten, aus denen man sich selbst versorgen kann sind enfach fantastisch und genau das was ich will. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Auf meinem <a href=""http://becomplete-spain.blogspot.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blog</a> halte ich Dich immer über alles auf dem Laufenden, sowohl was die Kosten angeht, als auch das Wachstum der Saat, mögliche Einnahmen aus Verkäufen usw. Du lernst mich dort auch noch etwas besser kennen und es wird viele Fotos zur Dokumentation des Fortschrittes geben.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Diese Transparenz ist mir wichtig, einmal deswegen, weil es Dein Geld ist, mit dem ich es starte und zum anderen, weil ich auch künftig Dein Vertrauen behalten möchte, damit einem freundlichen Kennenlernen am Lagerfeuer nichts im Wege steht! :)<br/><br/><i>Ich freu mich auf Dich!<br/>Karsten</i><br/></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm a recovering alcoholic with bipolar disorder.  These illnesses carry a significant stigma that can be a major impediment to employment and standing within a local community.  The business will build a reputation based on honesty, transparency and quality that will help alleviate the stigma attached to the diseases.  I've been unemployed for several years as I've tried to figure out what I want to do with my life.  This small business has become my passion at this juncture in my life.  I want to pursue this business to do the things I love for work while empowering others newly entering into sobriety.  The goal is to provide gainful employment and responsibility to those similarly trying to get their lives on track and become productive members of society.  Traditional avenues of employment depend upon references and a continuous work history, which are two qualities that those entering recovery may not have.  I want to alleviate these problems for persons working through a similar situation.<br/>
</li> <li>Contributing to this campaign not only helps this business get off the ground, but it will help individuals in need of gainful employment.  The business will operate on a basis of profit-sharing among myself and employees.  It aims to help re-integrate those in early recovery back into the mainstream with dignity and a sense of personal responsibility while learning new and useful skills.</li>
<li>Goals of 1740 Harwood Painting and Woodworking:</li>
<ul>
<li>Build a small business founded on the qualities of honesty and transparency<br/>
</li>
<li>Reduce stigma attached to persons with addiction and mental health disorders</li>
<li>Provide gainful employment opportunities for those in early recovery</li>
<li>Create connections with the local Middle Peninsula and Northern Neck communities<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>

I'm a recovering alcoholic with bipolar disorder.  These illnesses carry a significant stigma that can be a major impediment to employment and standing within a local community.  The business will build a reputation based on honesty, transparency and quality that will help alleviate the stigma attached to the diseases.  I've been unemployed for several years as I've tried to figure out what I want to do with my life.  This small business has become my passion at this juncture in my life.  I want to pursue this business to do the things I love for work while empowering others newly entering into sobriety.  The goal is to provide gainful employment and responsibility to those similarly trying to get their lives on track and become productive members of society.  Traditional avenues of employment depend upon references and a continuous work history, which are two qualities that those entering recovery may not have.  I want to alleviate these problems for persons working through a similar situation.
 Contributing to this campaign not only helps this business get off the ground, but it will help individuals in need of gainful employment.  The business will operate on a basis of profit-sharing among myself and employees.  It aims to help re-integrate those in early recovery back into the mainstream with dignity and a sense of personal responsibility while learning new and useful skills.
Goals of 1740 Harwood Painting and Woodworking:

Build a small business founded on the qualities of honesty and transparency

Reduce stigma attached to persons with addiction and mental health disorders
Provide gainful employment opportunities for those in early recovery
Create connections with the local Middle Peninsula and Northern Neck communities



  Any contributions toward establishing 1740 Harwood Painting and Woodworking are received with gratitude and will be put toward enriching the lives of a misunderstood class of individuals.   How You Can Help Here are the start-up needs for 1740 Harwood:  Monies garnered through this campaign will be put toward initial start-up costs including marketing and initial supplies including woodworking tools and painting equipment.  Documentation of spending will be provided to any donors who request it for accountability purposes.
 Contributing to 1740 Harwood provides donors with a sense of satisfaction in empowering a misunderstood, yet highly productive segment of the population.
Any funds collected short of the campaign goal will go directly toward establishing this business including, but not limited to:



Ladders
Painting tarps
Paint brushes and rollers
Saws (table and tile)
Dremel accessories
Initial marketing including website building, newspaper ads, and other print marketing needs



  Risks & Challenges 
 While there is always risk in starting a small business, there are few competitors on the Middle Peninsula fulfilling services in this particular niche.
With targeted marketing and the establishment of a reputation built by word of mouth, I strongly believe that 1740 Harwood can become a successful business that gives back to our local community.    Other Ways You Can Help If you're unable to contribute financially, here are some additional ways to help:  Please spread the campaign through social media or word of mouth to those who might see the value in it, or those who have experienced the disease of addiction or mental disorders with family and friends. Please use the Indiegogo share tools!
If you are local in Gloucester, please keep an open ear for anyone who might need the services of 1740 Harwood Painting and Woodworking.
   We at 1740 Harwood greatly appreciate your time and assistance in launching this important business.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Employers on the other hand, have lost faith in the skill of the Ghanaian job seeker and are not keen on hiring as much as they should.

<p><b>HISTORY</b></p>
<p>Girls Incorporated of Albany, GA was founded in March of 1974
through a partnership of Junior League and other committed citizens of Albany,
GA. Following the tragic death of a young ""latch key"" girl in Albany,
committed citizens decided to be the change by creating the Girls Club of
Albany. The location for the program was in the same building as of today, our
Park Place site, which was generously donated to the new organization by Ms.
Jane Willson of Sunnyland Farms.</p>
<p>Girls Incorporated of Albany, GA has come a long way since
opening its doors in 1974. From small, humble beginnings of serving a handful
of girls to serving thousands of girls of diverse racial and socio-economic
backgrounds in Southwest Georgia.  Here at
Girls Inc. of Albany, GA, we believe that all girls are strong, smart and bold;
and we are fully committed to ensuring that every girl has the opportunity to
reach her highest potential. Girls Inc. offers more than the typical
after-school program, or youth recreation center; through our use of national
as well as host community research based curriculum girls learn to employ their
immediate resource and make wise choices for their future. </p>
<p><b>WHAT BENEFIT IS GIRLS INC ALBANY GA?</b></p>
<p>Our research over recent years passed substantiates the need
for our efforts; over 30 million girls throughout the world will not attend
school to obtain a formal education, and each year nearly 1 million teenaged girls
between 15 and 19 will become willfully or involuntarily pregnant. However,
Girls Inc. of Albany, GA has been able to maintain a 100% teen pregnancy
prevention rate, 100% drug and alcohol abstinence rate, and a 100% high school
graduation rate among the girls who’ve enrolled within our programs. In 2012,
Girls Inc. was recognized nationally as a White House Champion for Change
honoree and as the 2012 Non-profit of the Year from the Albany Area Chamber of
Commerce.</p>

<p>La version francaise du projet se trouve à la suite de la version anglaise.</p><p><b>March 2015 UPDATE</b>: We have started the manufacturing of 18 traditional beehives. See more on the project website: <a href=""https://solidaritybybees.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://solidaritybybees.wordpress.com/</a></p><h1><b>RWANDA : « Solidarity » by bees<br/></b></h1><h2><b>Project</b></h2><div>
<b></b><p>Because of the absence of GMO and the very low usage of pesticides in agriculture, Rwanda has the perfect environment for the bees to produce a 100% natural honey. Even though Rwanda is the perfect place to produce natural and high quality honey, the local people can barely afford to eat honey, since almost all the honey sold there is imported from outside.</p>
<p>By organizing the local resources, we aim to create an ecosystem in which local population can work and improve their living conditions, and can afford eating honey. Honey is a very good nutriment supply for these rural population and can contribute to face malnutrition among the countryside population.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">                                      </span></p>

<p>Regarding the figures, the project aims to <b>produce 2 tons of honey yearly</b>, to <b>provide fair paid work to around 15 local people</b> and to <b>generate around $4.000 of yearly net profit, part of which will benefit to local people</b> (more details on the below section ""action to local people"").</p>

<h2><b>Origin of the project<br/></b></h2>
</div><div>
<b></b><p>Solidarity by bees... this is a project someone can find unusual..</p>
<p>The idea came out when traveling to the countryside, far from Rwanda capital city, Kigali. The country is small, although with over 11 million inhabitants. That is to say that almost every inch of land is inhabited. Rwandan people who live in the countryside are poor and have no way to move themselves out of poverty. They almost never eat meat, their meals are mainly composed of green beans. Children body can barely hide the malnutrition symptoms. Although, despite that fact, Rwandan children always smile at you and comes to your way... difficult to remain indifferent.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">          </span></p>
<p>Bees can work for them by providing enough food. The Rwandan who lives in the countryside cannot afford to buy honey, especially when the honey is imported, as it is mostly the case in Rwanda. Most of the countryside people here earn less than a dollar a day, so they are already glad to be able to eat daily meals. Living from hand to mouth has its full meaning here. Survive first ...!</p>

Because of the absence of GMO and the very low usage of pesticides in agriculture, Rwanda has the perfect environment for the bees to produce a 100% natural honey. Even though Rwanda is the perfect place to produce natural and high quality honey, the local people can barely afford to eat honey, since almost all the honey sold there is imported from outside.
By organizing the local resources, we aim to create an ecosystem in which local population can work and improve their living conditions, and can afford eating honey. Honey is a very good nutriment supply for these rural population and can contribute to face malnutrition among the countryside population.                                      


Regarding the figures, the project aims to produce 2 tons of honey yearly, to provide fair paid work to around 15 local people and to generate around $4.000 of yearly net profit, part of which will benefit to local people (more details on the below section ""action to local people"").
The project has an economic purpose and wants to be sustainable, but it also has a supportive purpose because it is expected to allocate part of the profits to support the local population .
With your help, the bees will allow many Rwandan children to continue their education.
With your help, the bees will provide a healthy food and treat several Rwandan families.
Thanks to you and with our help, the bees could significantly improve the lives of the poorest Rwandans who live hard, isolated in the countryside!
The project also aims to help protecting the bees worldwide, as part of the profits will be given to bee protection and environment protection funds (such as WSBF, Greenpeace, etc). 
This is paradoxical! While in the West, men and pesticides destroy the bees to the point of endangering their sustainability, African bees will work tirelessly to help supporting their European cousins.

</p><p>Our Story.</p>
<p>My name is Dave, and it’s good to finally meet
you.<span>  My business partner is Andrae Parks.  It’s a funny story how we
met.  But neither of us will deny that it
happen because God wanted it to.  Andrae and I are two typical individuals who have a love for coffee and a need for
internet access.  You see, I’ve just finished my
Bachelor’s degree in Business Entrepreneurship.  My next
journey is to achieve my Master’s degree in Creative Writing.  Andrae is busy in the Word of God.  I’m happy to share with you my business partner is ordained with New Direction Family Church in Joliet, Illinois.</span></p>
<p>We spend our days at a local Starbucks in St.
Charles, Illinois.<span>  Day after day, I
would be hard into my school work, and Andrae in his sermons.  Like any good neighbor, we began talking, and
found out we had a lot in common.  We
both want to open a coffee shop!  <br/></span></p><p><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></span>The most important thing in common is our dream of
promoting God.<span>  Have you ever found
yourself at church after the Pastor finished up his sermon, and notice that
time flew by because you were enjoying the company of others.  I’ve been there, too.  Wouldn’t it be nice to have a place outside
our beloved churches?  A place where we
could go and continue spending time in an environment that promotes, supports,
and values God.  Today's world is filled with Atheism and political correctness views that bring moments of darkness.  It can make it hard at times to openly discuss the love of God publicly.  A Cup of Jōb is our dream
of providing a Christian atmosphere within a coffee shop.  A place where individuals like my business
partner and I, along with others, can come to as we enjoy a relaxing

<p></p></div>","Our Story.
My name is Dave, and it’s good to finally meet
you.  My business partner is Andrae Parks.  It’s a funny story how we
met.  But neither of us will deny that it
happen because God wanted it to.  Andrae and I are two typical individuals who have a love for coffee and a need for
internet access.  You see, I’ve just finished my
Bachelor’s degree in Business Entrepreneurship.  My next
journey is to achieve my Master’s degree in Creative Writing.  Andrae is busy in the Word of God.  I’m happy to share with you my business partner is ordained with New Direction Family Church in Joliet, Illinois.
We spend our days at a local Starbucks in St.
Charles, Illinois.  Day after day, I
would be hard into my school work, and Andrae in his sermons.  Like any good neighbor, we began talking, and
found out we had a lot in common.  We
both want to open a coffee shop!  The most important thing in common is our dream of
promoting God.  Have you ever found
yourself at church after the Pastor finished up his sermon, and notice that
time flew by because you were enjoying the company of others.  I’ve been there, too.  Wouldn’t it be nice to have a place outside
our beloved churches?  A place where we
could go and continue spending time in an environment that promotes, supports,
and values God.  Today's world is filled with Atheism and political correctness views that bring moments of darkness.  It can make it hard at times to openly discuss the love of God publicly.  A Cup of Jōb is our dream
of providing a Christian atmosphere within a coffee shop.  A place where individuals like my business
partner and I, along with others, can come to as we enjoy a relaxing
environment.  A welcoming home for those
who are curious about God.  A foundation
of rock for those who know and love Him.  Cup of Jōb will be His beacon of light for the world.""I had a dream . . ."" Martin Luther King Jr.

Ceci est un changement de ""CAP"" ! Le Collectif d 'Artistes Philanthropes Au Coin Royal regroupe des Des gens qui ont en considération leur potentiel de CÉATIVITÉ !TRANSFORMATION et RÉUTILISATION pour un meilleur PARTAGE DES RESSOURCES Écologiquement !Pour PARTAGER l'ART des GENS et qu'enfin à Québec il y ait un endroit ou les artistes de toutes sphère se rencontrent et s'ENTRAIDE. Une idée, c'est GRATUIT !POUR MONTER DES PROJETS ENSEMBLE !Et bien sur un PROJET AUQUEL JE VOUS CONVIE TOUS.Un vrai BOUCHON de circulation, OEUVRE COLLECTIVE pour Changer de CAP VERS :UNE REFONTE DU SYSTÈME DE COLLECTE ET DE TRI DES MATIÈRES RÉSIDUELLES (BAC BLEU) !Pour une terre d'émotions ou l'ART des gens VAUT plus que l'ARGENT ! Créer pour le BESOIN !
L'idée du projet :
Ayant travaillé plusieurs années dans les domaines de la vente et de l'électronique, je suis partit à la rencontre de l'Europe sur le pouce et en scooter ayant une écoeurite aigu de la propension pour l'argent, et UNIQUEMENT l'Argent en dépît du bien être, des gens. 6200 Kilomètre sur un 50 CC et plusieurs pays dans l'corps j'ai pris conscience de moi-même et qu'au fond, me faisant aider au fil de mon périple, j'aimais aider les gens.Il ma d'abord fallu me diriger vers la vente d'usagé pour ensuite comprendre que notre consommation n'était rien d'autre qu'un échange d'argent contre un bien nous apportant de l'ÉMOTIONS.L'environnement étant ce qui nous permet de nous épanouir, j'ai donc envie de FAIRE LA DIFFÉRENCE pour la TERRE et LES GENS!
Qui je suis et pourquoi je désire menez ce projet jusqu'à sa réalisation :
Je m'apelle Christian Gagné et je serait plus qu'heureux de faire votre connaissance. Je suis homme de coeur avec force de conviction et sagesse de compréhension.J'aime mon prochain comme moi-même et j'ai autant à coeur la réussite des gens qui m'entourent et de ceux qui les entourent que la mienne.L'épanouissement d'une personne est quand à moi la plus belle réalisation à laquelle une autre personne puisse participer.Et comme nous sommes formé par notre environnement, j'aime à croire que j'ai été à la bonne école. Merci à tout particulièrement à Christiane Tardif pour m'avoir tant appris.Tigre de feu ascendant cheval avec pour chemin de vie la lune et l'hermite; J'aime comprendre et je vais au bout de mes idéaux.Une image vaut milles mots!
Ce projet  CHANGERA  la face du Québec :
Plus les gens auront à coeur le bien-être de leur semblables, plus les semblables auront à coeur leur bien-être. C'Est un '' cercle vicieux '' dans le bon sens !Pour le moment la société nous lance que l'idée est la suivante : Plus les gens auront à coeur les biens de leur semblabes, plus leur semblables auront à coeur leurs biens ! CA c'Est un vrai cercle vicieux !Des biens, y'en a déjà bien assez! Il serait temps qu'on soit BIEN ENSEMBLE et qu' ON fassent BIEN AVEC CE QU'ON AS !Retourner vers l'USAGÉ.Retourner vers la CRÉATION ET LA TRANSFORMATION plus que la SURCONSOMMATION.Retourner vers des valeurs de COEUR plutôt que monétaires !L'engrenage sur l'affiche, c'est le coeur À LA BONNE PLACE !
Pourquoi je demande ce montant :
Je n'y vais pas avec le dos de la main morte, je sait !379 000 $ seront nécéssaires pour acheter le bâtiment histoire d'établir une FORTERESSE DE L'ART PERMANENTE ET AUTONOME.Dès lors, Nous pourront généré des profits par les ventes de l'ART de GENS qui seront impliqué dans le ''CAP '', Créer des évênements POUR PERMETTRE LE PARTAGE DE CONNAISSANCES, L'ÉCHANGE DE TALENTS DIRECT. POUR LE BIEN-ÊTRE DE L'HUMANITÉ ! GRATUITEMENT !Qu'on arrête de payer pour TOUT, TOUT LE TEMPS !J'ai mis un petit 20 000 $ de plus histoire de backer le projet. J'invite les gens à s'impliquer d'avantage avec leur TEMPS et leur TALENTS, même si ca va prendre un peu de cash pour commencer tout ca plus efficacement !
Ce que j'ai fait jusqu'à maintenant pour tenir le projet :
Avoir tenu bon depuis 2 ans et demi.E enfin poser mon affiche !Avoir CHANGÉ DE CAP moi-même.Avoir compris que ce sont LES ÉMOTIONS qui motivent les gens et que l'ART des GENS (TEMPS et EFFORTS) est échanger avec l'ARGENT. Avoir CRÉÉR ce projet !Avoir FOI et ESPÉRANCE en mes CONVICTIONS.Et la SAGESSE d'être patient; Que tout viens à point à qui sait attendre.Je ramasse mes bouchons depuis plus d'un an. Avant même d'avoir pensé au projet.Je tente de Minimiser mon impact environnemental depuis que j'ai 15 ans.
CHANGER LE MONDE!!!!
Cette innovation saura prendre de l'ampleur et nous ouvrira un nouvel éventails de possibilité face aux réalisations COLLECTIVES. L'important c'est d'y croire qu'ENSEMBLE on peut FAIRE LA DIFFÉRENCE !Quand deux personne croient fortement en une idée, cette idée devient alors tangible et de cette espoir d'énergie nouvelle nait l'AMOUR .CROIRE EN SOI et CROIRE EN L'AUTRE pour générée tout simplement une meilleure confiance en SOI .Plus les gens auront confiance au POTENTIEL de leurs idées ENSEMBLE, plus il sera possible d'Accomplir de grande choses !La FOI en SOI déplace des montagnes !CHANGEONS LE MONDE en acceptant notre POUVOIR ILLIMITÉ !N'AYONS PLUS PEUR DE NOUS ! L'ENTRAIDE ET LE PARTAGE DU SAVOIR ET DE LA CRÉATIVITÉ !
Lorsque les projets seront financé, j'adopterai les mesure suivante pour le faire connaître  :
Faire connaître la boutique par un communiqué de presse.Faire connaître le '' CAP '' par un communiqué de presse.Faire connaître le projet '' BOUCHON de circulation ''  par une communiqué de presse.Faire connaître les projets connexe AU PARTAGE et à L'ENTRAIDE par les membre du collectif dans des communiés de presse.S'impliquer au niveau social et Artistique en tant que Pignon sur rue pour la propagation du concept et l'apostion de mention '' CAP '' à ceux qui s'impliqueront !
INVESTISSEMENTS Personnel en temps et en argent : 
Depuis le tout début de l'ouverture de la Boutique Au Coin Royal le 17 août 2012, j'ai investit environs 60 000 $ dans la boutique .Plus de 7800 heures sur place.Près de 10 000 heures depuis le plus simple début dans un marché aux puces.Pour Constater que le RÉEL plaisir que j'y trouvait était que TOUT soit UTILE et que CHACUN SOIT HEUREUX Et enfin développer cette idée révolutionnaire que la  : "" REFONTE MONDIALE DU SYSTÈME DE TRI ET DE COLLECTE DES MATIÈRE RÉSIDUELLES '' . Pour une planète plus SAINE !Et celle tout aussi conservatrice du:   Collectif d'Artistes Philanthropes '' CAP ''  Pour permettre un meilleur PARTAGE et ÉCHANGE de nos Connaissances et de nos talents plutôt que de notre ARGENT ! Un Changement de cap pour moi !J'offre ces petits cadeaux à tout ceux qui CROIENT que CES projets COLLECTIF pourront amener les gens à comprendre qu'ENSEMBLE nous sommes plus fort :Parce que lorsqu'on donne à autrui, on se donne à soit même le plaisir de voir le bonheur dans les yeux de celui qui recoit. Et ça ! C'est un VRAI BONHEUR !Comment justifiez-vous le délai que vous demandez pour amasser les fonds ?PATIENCE ET TEMPS font plus que FORCE ET COURAGE !Ca prendra le temps que ca prendra, l'important c'est pas l'Argent, ce sont les gens qui voudront bien partager leur TEMPS et leur TALENT  en se joignant au '' CAP ''CE QUE J'AURAI BESOIN dans l'idéal pour mener tout les projets à termes :Dans le meilleur des monde, Je n'aurais même pas besoin d'ARGENT pour réaliser se projet la. Mais compte tenu du MANQUE DE TEMPS de la pluspart de gens encadré dans le 40H semaine ( Alors qu'on devrais faire des EFFORT 24h/24h pour obtenir ce qu'on souhaite vraiment ), Il se trouve que j'aurai besoin d'argent.379 000 $Et si Je désire acheter la batisse dans laquelle mon commerce est établi, il serait plus EFFICACE de payer mon propriétaire en argent plutôt qu'en bouchons.... Il est fin mais ...POUR RESTER EN PLACE TELLE UNE FORTERESSE POUR LA CONSERVATION DU PATRIMOINE CULTUREL : LES GENS ET LEUR ÉPANOUISSEMENT !LA NATURE !L'ART DES GENS !POUR PROMOUVOIR PARTAGE ET ENTRAIDE VERS L'INFINI ET PLUS LOIN ENCORE !Quand se concrétiseront les projets :Lorsque nous auront assez de BOUCHONS et qu'un endroit sera trouvé pour assembler notre CRÉATION, nous fixeront une date et le projet prendra un nouvel envol par un communiqué de presse dans les médias.J'incite fortement les gens à PROPAGER le projet À TRAVERS LE MONDE et à communiquer directement avec moi pour AGENCER les BOUCHONS de CIRCULATION pour une seule et MÊME DATE !PATIENCE ET TEMPS font plus que FORCE ET COURAGE !Tout plein d'amis et de client m'amène des bouchons ! Chaque petit geste est IMPORT-TEMPS !Déjà PLUS DE 2000 BOUCHONS d'accumulé !Le développement durable est la PRIORITÉ dans ce projet.Puisque rien ne sert PERD ,Rien ne se CRÉER, tout se TRANSFORME !Compte tenu qu'une FORTE PARTIE de ce que nous mettons dans le BAC BLEU, est envoyé à L'INCINÉRATEUR.Compte tenu que vous PAYER pour les contenants de TOUT ce que vous acheter.Compte tenu que vous PAYER pour le service de collecte des matière résiduelle, Le tri sur place et pour l'incinérateur.Ne serait-il pas plus JUSTIFIÉ de se faire REMBOURSER les contenants et être certain que leur transformation sera ÉQUITABLE pour notre ENVIRONNEMENT.Plus on CONSIGNE, plus on RÉDUIS plus on RÉUTILISE, plus on RECYCLE INTELLIGEMENT .La fameuse règle des trois R apprise au primaire qu'on ne respecte pas !C'est PAS GÉNIAL !FAIRE LA DIFFÉRENCE et ÊTRE AUTHENTIQUE !!!Il est possible de comprendre ici que mon BUT premier étant le BIEN des gens qui m'entoure et non LEURS BIENS .C'est pourquoi je permet à TOUS et à TOUTE de contribuer avec des BOUCHONS !1 - Plastique, metal, liège, twist-cap , ETC 2 - Lait, eau, jus, bière, vin, fort, Gatorade, ETC (Produit CLOP Consommable liquide )3 - '' CLOP '' Consigné Là Ou PrescritPour créer un BOUCHON de CIRCULATION Mobile, histoire de faire AVANCER LA CAUSE !ET SI TOUT LE MONDE EMBARQUE :J'aimerais fortement mettre en place un deuxième '' CAP '' Ou l'on jugera bon de l'installer :D . POUR RAMASSER DES BOUCHONS !CHAQUE PETIT GESTE EST IMPORTANT!QU'ENFIN ON CONSIGNE TOUT ! Pour une planête en SANTÉ ! POUR UNE CONSCIENCE COLLECTIVE !ET AUTANT QU'ON POURRA favoriser l'ENTRAIDE et le PARTAGE de notre TEMPS !- Créér un poste de télé communautaire pour les artistes locaux...- ETC ... Qu’est-ce qui fait que votre projet ne sera pas seulement la « saveur du mois » ?Le moment ou les gens réaliseront qu'ensemble tout est possible et qu'il suffit simplement de faire l'effort de COMMUNIQUER et de S'IMPLIQUER, l'engrenage sera en place et pour y rester ! :)La CLÉ C'est de prendre le TEMPSDe COMMUNIQUERSes besoins, c'est inquiétudes, ses désirs, ses joies, ses peines.ET SURTOUT D'ÊTRE ÉCOUTER et non pas juste ENTENDU !Quand vous vous EXPRIMER ou vous '' attendez votre tour pour parler '', vous être en mode CONVICTION.Alors que lorsque vous ÉCOUTER vous êtes en mode SAGESSE.PATIENCE et temps font plus que FORCE et COURAGE!C'est d'avoir le goût de COMPRENDRE son amoureux, sa famille, ses amis, ses collègues, ses voisins...Ne ce sent-on pas mieux lorsque nous COMPRENONS ?Pourquoi ce projet vous tient-il à cœur ?L'avenir de notre planète est en jeu et donc de tout ceux et celles qui y habite. Il serait temps qu'on se réveille et qu'on FASSE NOTRE PART dans l'écologie.CESSONS de polluer !CECI EST UN CHANGEMENT DE CAP !Lorsque la campagne sera terminé Étant Pignon sur rue et Visant l'Achat de la batisse dans laquelle mon commerce est établie depuis plus de deux ans et demi, je compte bien transformer la vocation du bâtiment en tant que Collectif D'artiste Philanthropes.J'Acceuillerai donc avec le sourire, 6 jours semaines, tous et chacun qui voudront bien PENSER plutôt que DÉPENSER.Je pourrai ainsi :- Propager et apposer la mention '' CAP '' partout ou les gens voudrons bien s'entraider et partager leur talents et connaissances GRATUITEMENT pour le bien de leurs prochains et non pour '' ses biens '' !ET :- Établir un ''CAP'' Dans plusieurs autres villes, permettant un meilleur échange de l'ART des GENS !Je souhaite attirer l'Attention de ceux et celles qui auront le coeur de croire que la plus grande force de l'homme est de la mettre au service de ses semblables.Tout les projets sont les bienvenues, Je souhaite simplement que les gens partage entre eux leurs talents et non leur argent :) .

<p>Hello, my Name is Frank Hinz and i would like to turn today
to the Unity of indiegogo.</p>
<p>4 Years ago i had a very difficult Crisis due to a heavy Sickness
that had pulled me out of my normal daily life.</p>
<p>Even though i have regained a better health now i am not
able to continue with my old living and working habits. For example ,i am not
allowed to lift heavy things anymore , certain activitys that can strain my
body and much more. But because i am only 47 years young i feel that i am not
ready yet to just sit around all day at Home and not do anything at all,
because this is not in my Nature. </p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>Unfortunatly it is not easy to get the Banks here in
Germany  to understand my Concept . They
are asking me to come up with at least 50% 
of the Money. But this is not
possible for me since i can not afford it ,i am in need of your Help.</p>
<p>What is it i want to do you Wonder? Well let me Explain it
to you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to work again and my know about the sale other pass. For this
purpose, I will be opening a car rental with attached event agency. Here,
everyone whether private or company rented this trike and tours for guided or
explore the area at your own happiness. We asked customers in Germany and they
were willing to have 350 km just to ride this ride pass. Who wants to can participate
after their departure, even at a barbecue party with us. Companies are up to 12
vehicles for disposal and it can 24 people at the same time to spend an
unforgettable day.</p><p><br/></p><p><span>I have selected the following cities</span></p><p>USA  Oxnard (Kalifornien) and <span>Hinesville (Georgia</span>)</p><p>Deutschland  Frankfurt am Main und München.<br/></p>
<p>I really do not want to beg , but i do want to have a new
Sense for my Life, and on a nice side effect , be able to give 50 more People a
new Job Opportunity. At the same time i would make sure that the other
Workplaces in the Area around the Branches would get business as well through
my own customers ( i.e. pubs, restaurants ,hotels etc...). but also i do
understand that each and every one of you has to watch their own Money i want
to make you a Proposal. .</p>
<p>Eaxch and every one that wants to back this Projekt up , can
do this while either renting a Funcar ahead of time or through a Donation.
Everyone that decides to rent a Vehicle ahead of time ( meaning before the
business is opened up) i give a Price reduction of 50% on the regular Price.</p>
<p>Since i am going to open a Rental Place in Germany and the USA , each and every
Customer can pick and choose a sight where they would like to rent and drive
the Vehicle.With all the Preparations i would eb able to start the business in
2016 and also give you as a Test driver a Chance to test the Cars. I would be
very happy to be able to invite you after your Test drive to a nice BBQ because i believe that „whom stops
believing in the good things in life stops living!“</p>
<p>It is not my Goal at Indiegogo to get all the Money for all
5 Branches ,but to get the Money for 1-2 Branches as a Start up help so i can
make it bigger and grow the business from there on. </p>
<p>I Want to show with
a  Raffle How thankful i am. I will do a
drawing lot for all the people that would be willing to support me . the
Winning ticket will get a 100 000€  Fun
Car with our very own Paintjob and also i will toss a 1 Week Vacation in
germany up, where we will see all the sights together  in the beautiful Eifel, of course with the
Funcars incl. Flight and Food For 2 People.</p>
<p>If you have any other
Questions please do not hesitate and write me, i will try my best to answer you
as soon as possible.</p>

<p><b>What &amp; Why</b></p>
<p>Stupid Delicious! Desserts is raising funds to employ local teens and expand a start-up bake shop in the historic and eclectic Baltimore neighborhood of Fells Point.  This Black-owned bake shop is a one-of-a-kind dessert shop that features cupcakes inspired by popular Baltimore restaurant brunch items, celebrating some of the best food the city has to offer.  Though its only been open for five months, its popularity is growing so fast that the sole baker needs help! </p>
<p><b>Impact of Recent Violence</b></p>

Stupid Delicious! Desserts is raising funds to employ local teens and expand a start-up bake shop in the historic and eclectic Baltimore neighborhood of Fells Point.  This Black-owned bake shop is a one-of-a-kind dessert shop that features cupcakes inspired by popular Baltimore restaurant brunch items, celebrating some of the best food the city has to offer.  Though its only been open for five months, its popularity is growing so fast that the sole baker needs help! 
Impact of Recent Violence
During the recent unrest in Baltimore, looters struck two of Stupid D's immediate neighbors.  The result has been a reduction in foot traffic that's stifling to businesses in the area and slowing Stupid D's ability to expand on its own steam.

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>Steel City Grazers’ mission is to provide an environmentally-friendly alternative to herbicides and fossil-fuel powered machinery by using goats to remove weeds, brush, and vines.<br/>
<br/>
Using goats to eat unwanted plants is <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/265257406_A_Vegetation_Management_Experiment_Goats_Grazing_Shrublands_in_Doana_Natural_Park"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a proven method</a> for vegetation management.  
Goats love brush with special preference for leaves and flowers, leaving targeted plants unable to photosynthesize or go to seed.  The majority of 
seeds that do go through the goats’ digestive tract come out nonviable. 
 The goats’ hooves also help trample the unwanted plants, without disturbing the soil.<br/>
<br/>
There are many benefits to using goats over conventional landscaping 
techniques.  Grazing does not involve noisy machinery or toxic herbicides.  Goats can go where people and 
machinery can’t, such as steep slopes or areas of dense vegetation. They are particularly fond of plants that humans particularly hate, like poison ivy and thorny brush.  To top it all off — the goats leave behind free 
fertilizer.  And it’s fun! <br/>
<br/>
<i>Business Philosophy</i><br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>Steel City Grazers does not support the overuse of synthetic 
herbicides for vegetation control.  Using goats is a natural 
alternative. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Steel City Grazers is a proponent of urban agriculture.  Having working 
goats on display in the city is a way to show support for, and start a 
conversation about, keeping livestock in urban settings.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Steel City Grazers believes in the ethical treatment of all animals .  Each goat is raised with love and care.  The health, safety, and
 contentment of the herd are our top priorities. </li>
</ul>
<br/><h3> Background<br/>
</h3>
The Steel City Grazers owner has always had a fondness for goats, but it wasn't until her Peace Corps service in Zambia that she got one of my own.  When she returned to to the US, she started Arlington Acres Farm, a micro-farm in the city of Pittsburgh.  It has two Nigerian 
Dwarf goats used for dairy, as well as chickens, beehives, and crops.<br/>
<br/>
Arlington Acres had been approached several times with requests for weed
 removal services and event rentals.  With only two goats and a focus on
 dairy, Arlington Acres has not had the capacity to fulfill these needs.  However, these requests planted the seeds of a possible
 future goat grazing business.  <br/>
<br/>
Through the work of <a href=""http://www.treepittsburgh.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tree Pittsburgh</a>, excitement for goat grazing started to grow in 2014 when an 
out-of-state grazing company was brought in for a one-day demonstration 
in Polish Hill.  <a href=""http://www.growpittsburgh.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grow Pittsburgh</a>
 continued the momentum by bringing interested parties to the table in 
hopes of supporting goat grazing in Pittsburgh.  It then seemed fitting 
that Pittsburgh’s only contemporary urban dairy goat farm expand to become 
Pittsburgh’s first goat grazing business.  <br/>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Steel City Grazers' biggest challenge is getting funding in place and sourcing the animals to begin operations for the summer of 2015.  The Steel City Grazers' owner has experience with raising goats and has developed a business plan for the endeavor, so the business is in a good position to launch, pending funding.  <br/>
</p>If Steel City Grazers does not reach it's goal of $40,000, the funds received will still be put toward the business, though alternate funding may need to be sourced, and the start of operations may be pushed back a couple of months.<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>

Humanity (AHFH) is a Christian-based, nonprofit dedicated to eliminating
substandard housing through its mission: Seeking to put God’s love into action,
Amarillo Habitat for Humanity brings people together to build homes, communities
and hope. Since founded in 1981, AHFH has completed more than 100 homes in our
community. Habitat builds three-to-five bedroom homes for low-to-median income
families who qualify and complete our program requirements. A Habitat home is
provided to a family with a 25-year, no interest mortgage loan. This allows for a
lower monthly payment and brings more income stability to the household.


By providing safe, affordable homes to underserved, low-income populations, we
also have a responsibility to educate our families on healthy financial and lifestyle
habits to ensure their success as a homeowner and overall citizen. Once accepted
into our program, applicants are deemed Habitat “Partner Families” and required to
complete our three step, Homeowner Partnership Program


1.  Sweat Equity 



Partner Families must complete 500 volunteer hours with
our organization by working on other families’ homes, working at our
ReStore and/or helping with other Amarillo HFH projects.


Children in the household can contribute to hours by earning 1 hour per
""A"" on a report card.


A portion of the sweat equity hours can be completed by family and
friends.


2.  Financial Stability Classes 


Partner Families are required to attend 30
educational classes that focus on Dave Ramsey’s Financial PeaceUniversity curriculum, financial stewardship, basic maintenance skills and the
responsibilities of owning a home (i.e. timely payments, insurance, etc.).

Classes are held on scheduled Thursdays from 6:30 PM - 8:00 PM at the
Amarillo Habitat for Humanity administrative office at 2700 S. Wilson.


3.  Down payment 



Partner Families must provide a $1,500 down
payment toward their first year of taxes and insurance on their home.









The Homeowner Partnership Program generally takes about 18 months - 2 years to
complete. The three steps of the Homeownership Partnership Program must be
completed before the Partner Family can receive the home.""

Sadly, one of the things that struck me when visiting the most rural areas was the incredible poverty. Unfortunately things are getting worse. <br/><br/><p></p>
<h3>The Great African Land Grab and Modern Slavery<br/>

<div>It is a little reported fact, but after the 2008 food price spikes, many government started worrying about where their food will come from. The worlds' population is expected to grow to under 10B by 2050. Putting pressure on our agricultural production system. There is an aggressive push to buy up African land for foreign food and bio-fuel production.</div>
<div>When speculators and foreign investors buy up land, only they benefit. All profits are exported while the locals become low-wage earners. In fact, wages are so low that it would be more honest to call such employment <b>slavery</b>. </div>

<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>What we can Achieve</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>Our aim: Increase access to tractors and farm implements. Reduce manual labor and increase farmer's incomes. By increasing the incomes of farmers we help them reinvest into their lively hood. They can purchase more land. This is especially important for women, who are often more vulnerable. By owning the land they farm they have more power and control of their future. <p></p>
<p>Strategy: Create independent rural stations where farmers can rent tractors, purchase inputs (fertilizers, seeds, etc) and learn modern farming techniques. <br/>The income received goes right back into maintenance and further training. We hope to make each station independent of future monetary aid. Like this we can help more people. </p>

<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p><span>The African continent has received billions in aid yet most of it has been either stolen or squandered. We want to use the power of crowdfunding to help those in need directly. </span></p>
<p>We must act quickly because Africa is entering a period of rapid change. Foreign investment is pouring in, unfortunately often with negative consequences. Land is being bought up, farmers who have worked the land for generations are being displaced or turned into low wage workers. </p>

Israel has the most advanced agriculture in the world. By importing their incredible know-how and technology into Africa we can help farmers increase yields, reduce waste, go directly to world markets, and most importantly increase their incomes. 

What we can Achieve

Our aim: Increase access to tractors and farm implements. Reduce manual labor and increase farmer's incomes. By increasing the incomes of farmers we help them reinvest into their lively hood. They can purchase more land. This is especially important for women, who are often more vulnerable. By owning the land they farm they have more power and control of their future. 
Strategy: Create independent rural stations where farmers can rent tractors, purchase inputs (fertilizers, seeds, etc) and learn modern farming techniques. The income received goes right back into maintenance and further training. We hope to make each station independent of future monetary aid. Like this we can help more people. 
Campaign goals: $60,000
$15,000 Three used tractors. Preferably Massey Ferguson 100 or 200 series.                                Between 45hp and 100hp. $5,000    Spare parts and repairs$4,600  40' Container from Montreal to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.$400      Transportation costs for tractors from place of purchase to container$6,000 Clearance fees in Tanzania plus a ""rainy day"" amount $3,000 Building a small facility for each tractor where it can be stored securely and                  repaired
$7,000 Plow, trailer, disc harrow, generator and other inputs (fertilizers, drip                              irrigation)$5,000 Training courses for farmers in the most up to date techniques techniques.$7,000 Travel fund for members of our organization, tractor technicians and an                        agronomist
$5,000 If our campaign is successful, about $5,000 will be deducted from our                           funds to pay for hosting on Indiegogo$2,000 Perks fulfillment (t-shirts + video)
The Impact

The African continent has received billions in aid yet most of it has been either stolen or squandered. We want to use the power of crowdfunding to help those in need directly. 
We must act quickly because Africa is entering a period of rapid change. Foreign investment is pouring in, unfortunately often with negative consequences. Land is being bought up, farmers who have worked the land for generations are being displaced or turned into low wage workers. 





Risks & Challenges
A container takes around four months to get to Tanzania. There is a risk that it might be delayed even more. It happens often, especially because of pirate activity (Tanzania is south of Somalia). Tractors are always useful, but most so when preparing the land for agriculture. We might miss this time frame. There isn`t much we can do about this. Rural AreasWe`re going to be working in some of the most rural places in the world. Roads are horrible, especially when it rains. Equipment breaks down often. Tractor technicians are not plentiful. Gas stations are far. Electricity in the middle of nowhere. Wish us luck! Problems are plentiful. That`s why we plan on bringing a generator.Spare partsSpare parts are difficult to find and horribly expensive. Theft & VandalismTanzania is one of the safest African countries. Nonetheless, corruption is endemic and if property is stolen it can be difficult to get it back. Our tractors will always be under lock and key in a specially constructed facility.

Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word!Convince a farmer to donate an old tractor. Convince your company to make a contribution.Are you an experienced agronomist or do you posses another skill we could use?

<h3><b>The Future of Space Travel and Exploration</b></h3>
<p>Introducing the Aten Spacecraft from Relativity Research. The Aten is the world's ONLY interstellar space vehicle which uses a non-linear mode of flight enabling it to travel the huge distances of space in a fraction of the time it takes now. </p>
<p>Relativity Research has been researching, designing, and developing this amazing technology for over 8 years. We have consulted several physicists during this time and have top scientists developing this amazing spacecraft. The science behind the Aten is rock solid and the propulsion system it uses can save billions of dollars in fuel, add the reusability factor to space vehicles, and transport crew and passengers back and forth to space with no bad side effects on the human body. The fact that the Aten makes the journey to space so much shorter than it would normally be lends to more time for exploration and research. <b>Before making a decision, please continue reading below and visit our website to learn about the science behind this amazing technology.</b></p>

<p>Conventional science tells us that the fastest way to travel between points A and B is a straight line. Modern physics tells us this is not true, but instead that the fastest way to travel between two points is to distort time-space and bring points A and B closer together. </p>
<p><b>How Do We Do This?</b></p>

The Aten Spacecraft solves all of these problems, as the gravity amplification system does not need to be on continuously, rather only when it is engaged in interstellar flight. The Aten can be used for manned and unmanned missions, transporting cargo to the International Space Station and further exploration of the universe and even space tourism.<br/><p></p>

<h3><i>Why Does the Spacecraft Have a Disc-Like Shape?</i></h3>
<p><i>This is a very good question and it has nothing to do with keeping up with the image that UFOs have been given in sci-fi movies! There is a scientific reason why this type of spacecraft needs to fit into one of the following geometrical shapes:</i></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><i>Circular of ""Disc"" Shape</i></li>
<li><i>Hexagonal Shape</i></li>
<li><i>Octagonal Shape</i></li>
<li><i>Triangular Shape</i></li>
</ol>
<div><i>The reason that only these shapes will suit the design of this type of spacecraft has to do the necessity of precision measurements of the angular placement of the amplifiers which must be equidistant from the center of the vehicle in order to allow for equal energy distribution throughout the entire spacecraft.</i></div>

<h3>What it's all about:</h3>
<p>Roller Derby is one of the fastest growing sports in the world! These amazing athletes need specialized gear from outfitters that know the sport and the equipment they use. That's where <strong>Roll Play Skates </strong>comes in!</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been skating for over 30 years. With experience in speed skating, dance skating, roller hockey and many other forms, I can provide expertise that few others can.</li>
<li>Skating in all forms is my passion. I truly enjoy sharing my knowledge, teaching skaters and using my experience to outfit them in the proper gear for their skating level and needs. <strong>Roll Play Skates</strong> has been my dream for many a year and I am now about to embark on that dream. This campaign is to help us generate the initial funds needed to outfit a store and secure a local physical retail space for skaters to know they can get the quality they need.</li>
<li>Roller Derby is not only a sport. It's a vast community that is changing women's lives across the world. It serves as not only a place to become an amazing athlete but also a place that allows women to feel accepted and empowers them to become stronger people overall. What an amazing opportunity for you to help empower women and change their lives!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for a total of $30,000 to get this dream underway. You can trust it will be utilized in the following means:</p>
<ul>
<li>To secure a great physical retail location in the Denver Metro area</li>
<li>For initial inventory of all gear and fill the new store</li>
<li>To help fund the great marketing plan we have devised to get the word out and create the excitement!</li>
<li>To help create a booth environment to be set up at local tournaments so that skaters will never be far from new equipment</li>

<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<ul><li>We have set up a great contribution perk system that will include everything from gear items to full skate packages to season tickets and much much more. And every contributor gets their name on our ""Builders of Empowerment"" wall in our shop! </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We foresee very little risk in the success of Roll Play Skates.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Competition: Competition is good in business. Our competitors are quite a distance away from the Denver Metro area and with our decades of experience in the industry, skaters will get an experience they can get nowhere else.</li>
<li>Many new businesses end up failing after a year or two but we have a very strong business plan with goals set out into the next several years. We have a strong marketing plan and we are embeded in the fabric of the community to help the marketing of Roll Play Skates. We will also be branching out into the skateboarding services in the future as well to suppliment the business and to accomodate the lack of good skateboard shops in the area.

<p>Made with Natural Ingredients and Patented Technology, Rewind HP’s proprietary formula utilizing Copper Sulfate as the active ingredient, prevents the creation and build-up of a toxin called Acetaldehyde.  When you drink alcohol- beer, liquor or wine, it begins to metabolize over time into Acetaldehyde.  Acetaldehyde is 20 to 30 times more toxic than the alcohol itself.  And it’s this Acetaldehyde that causes the negative (hangover) symptoms after consuming alcohol.</p>

<p style=""font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-bottom: -1px;"">HOW DOES REWIND HP WORK?</p>
<p>After you drink alcohol- beer, liquor or wine- your body metabolizes it into Acetaldehyde.  Acetaldehyde is <i>20 to 30 times more toxic</i> than the alcohol itself! It’s this Acetaldehyde that causes the negative (hangover) symptoms after consuming alcohol.  Rewind HP is the ONLY product that directly interacts with the alcohol in your body BEFORE it has a chance to create Acetaldehyde and cause havoc.  When you take a Rewind HP after you finish consuming alcohol, it goes into the stomach and attaches to the alcohol, converting it into a simple amino acid that your body quickly breaks down and gets rid of.  Whether you are having just one, or having many, Rewind HP will prevent the buildup of Acetaldehyde by neutralizing the alcohol.  So, no Acetaldehyde and no negative effects.  Just a happy and healthy body.</p>
<p style=""font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-bottom: -1px;"">WHAT MAKES REWIND DIFFERENT?</p>
<p style=""padding-bottom: 10px;"">Although there seems to be a flood of products on the market for hangover symptoms, many of them come with complicated directions, require you to mix powders, drink it throughout the night, or even guess beforehand how much you'll drink.  Rewind's formula and dosage allows you to just relax and enjoy your night. You don't have to plan in advance how many drinks you're going to have, or remember to take something while you're out having fun.  And if a couple of dinner drinks turn into a night on the town, Rewind will still be there for you at the end of the night, ready to prevent your hangover.</p>
<p style=""font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; margin-bottom: -1px;"">WHERE IS REWIND HP MADE?</p>
<p>All manufacturing and production of Rewind is done within the United States.  Our initial manufacturing and blending are done at facilities in Houston, Texas.  After that, the final blending, bottling and distribution are done in Waterbury, Connecticut.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432139827/xk4j9dipip4irkocz9dz.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;""/>
<p>Aside from the science behind our patented technology, Rewind HP has been tested extensively throughout the New England area with distributors, retailers and an internet website.</p>

WHERE IS REWIND HP MADE?
All manufacturing and production of Rewind is done within the United States.  Our initial manufacturing and blending are done at facilities in Houston, Texas.  After that, the final blending, bottling and distribution are done in Waterbury, Connecticut.

Aside from the science behind our patented technology, Rewind HP has been tested extensively throughout the New England area with distributors, retailers and an internet website.

MARKETING & PROMOTIONS
We have interacted directly with consumers at beer festivals, concerts, sporting events, and we even participated in the Boston St. Patty’s Day Parade…all with great success.




WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING ABOUT REWIND HP?
""I had the opportunity to receive a free bottle while I was at the Country Music Fest in Nashville. I had drank a lot of alcohol one night and drank Rewind when I got back to my hotel and was so thankful when I woke up the next morning with no hangover. I would love to learn about becoming a distributor.""
-Karon Nemetz

""REWIND stands leagues above the other hangover remedies and in my book it should be the benchmark on which all others should strive to achieve.""
-Jim T

""Ran the road race, tried the product and one word… OUTSTANDING!""
- Dustin, MA

""This 
   Stuff is Magical… You have a winner here.""
- Tom, CT
WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM ALL THIS MARKET RESEARCH?Simply put:  When you consume 
 alcohol, whether just one or many, taking a Rewind HP is the smart, healthy and responsible choice.  Rewind HP will help everyone that consumes alcohol...period.
While it does a great job of preventing negative (hangover) symptoms, Rewind HP’s main feature is that it neutralizes alcohol.  It eliminates the alcohol BEFORE your body has to go through the marathon of processing and metabolizing the alcohol out on its own.As a Functional Lifestyle Beverage, Rewind HP is about keeping your life in balance, whatever your lifestyle is.  Think of it this way...You put the alcohol in and Rewind HP takes it out.
HOW DOES YOUR CONTRIBUTION HELP?
We have been passionate about how great this product is for quite some time and are finally ready to launch Rewind HP to the world, allowing consumers like you connect with Rewind HP for yourselves and your individual lifestyles.  With your help and support, we will use the funding from this campaign to:

Build a completely new website
Finish our branding, messaging and marketing strategies
Activate a complete internet marketing and social media campaign
Begin full-scale production for inventory buildup
Develop strategic partners for national distribution opportunities

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Cafe Caracol is our first venture as a collective. As individuals, the members that compose this collective come with a strong entrepreneurial background. Some born south of the border, some from here the Bay Area. We have the priceless privilege of walking ancestral knowledge of living and healing. We are Indigenous, Afro-Mexicans, South Americans, and Chicanos that crossed paths thanks to the power of community organizing and Mexica Danza. We all have worked with youth, displaced folks, migrant women, children, and elders.</p>
<p>In the spirit of support and solidarity we have chosen the name Caracol to honor our relatives in the south, the Zapatista community, who have been resisting since 1994. In 2003 they founded ""Caracoles"" as a way of forming autonomous communities organized by regions, in Chiapas, México. By serving coffee grown in these communities, we are supporting their resistance and aspiring to create similar communities with you in this space. </p>
<h3>What We Want To Do</h3>
<p>We believe in the saying “If you want to lift a village, start with its women”. Cafe Caracol is a cooperative run by people of color with deep love and roots in Oakland. We are looking to open space for healing, organizing, and cultural work through the culture of coffee. With this project we will be able to access spaces that will bring opportunities for people of color, females and female identified individuals; to have a safe venue to start and expand their business ideas, showcase their talents. To have a place for social and political education, organizing against patriarchy, displacement, and to resist and expel colonization. This is truly a community venture from which we will not profit. Our goal is to create a 501c3 and create programs and workshops specifically for our youth and women of color.</p>
<p>We already have our location as we were invited to open a cafe in the building of Omni Commons, a community center of twelve Bay Area collectives with a shared political vision. If you don't already know about the Omni Commons, please take a look at the amazing space they have created in the community: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zccga90hcY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zccga90hcY</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your financial support, your participation. We need $35,000 to push this project into a reality. We need one strong, collective effort. We would love for you to be a part of our collective and growing community that uses this space for our families and our children to engage in the programs that will be created out of this project. Please also come by to party with all of us at the closing of this campaign, to celebrate. We need you, your family, and friends.</p>
<p>We will use the space and part of the revenue generated through the cafe to support local community projects, collectives, and individuals doing healing and liberating work. We will build a community bookstore for creative and critical thought.  We will also use the space to run a training program where youth and women of color will gain skills and experience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are contributing to our community by offering spaces to come together, organize and thrive. Also, our coffee is sourced from the Zapatista communities in Chiapas, Mexico. The space for Caracol Cafe will connect us to a network of organizations that our community can greatly benefit from. We will act as the promoters and cultivators of this project for financial and social justice. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Marketing</p>
<p>We are one block off the busy Telegraph street in North Oakland.  We will be active with promotion.  This  includes social media, networking, signage, all that we can do to make sure you know our doors are open.</p>
<p>Budget</p>
<p>We are all dreaming big for this space and can only make it possible with your contribution and commitment to this project's success.  We are also selling tamales, doing pop ups and looking for creative minds to help fund this project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Promote our campaign. Share it widely with all of your friends! If you know of ways that can help us reach our goal, let us know. We will also be publishing a list of ‘in kind’ donations if you wish to help us that way. If you are an architect, a carpenter, a plumber or anything that can help us build up and you can donate your time, get in touch with us. We would really like to talk to you. Become part of this community, we would love to see you around soon.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>CocoapreneurPgh LLC serves to circulate information about Black businesses and entrepreneurs in the Greater Pittsburgh area. Through Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, businesses are shared, complete with tags, links, and various other contact information. Customers can also direct message to inquire about certain businesses they're seeking and they will receive a list of options. All services have been free of charge since inception!</p>
<p>CocoapreneurPgh was founded and is run by Khamil Scantling, a transplant to the city of Pittsburgh. Khamil came to Pittsburgh in 2005 to attend The University of Pittsburgh. While at Pitt, she noticed a void of Black owned business to meet certain cultural needs, primarily hair and beauty. As she got older and spent more time in the city, she also noticed a void of a thriving Black middle class community. She figured the two occurrences went hand-in-hand. It was then that Cocoapreneur started to brew in her mind. Her experiences in other places gives her the insight to see Pittsburgh's potential IF the Black communities that once thrived here are brought back to their former glory.</p>
<p>Since beginning in November 2015,  over 100 businesses have been shared via social media, events, and word of mouth. With the Cocoapreneur social media accounts gaining more support, more people have been reaching out for suggestions on businesses in their neighborhoods to meet their needs and Khamil can no longer sufficiently accommodates the demand. That's why this directory is necessary; people can find their local businesses at anytime and to any depth.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds raised will go toward a fully functional directory in which you can filter by various categories including ""neighborhood"" and ""zip code"". There will be an interactive map as well, which sets this directory aside from any other Pittsburgh has had. Users can submit listings they do not see and after review, those listings will be added to the directory. There will also be various components that continue to highlight business and keep visitors in the know about Pittsburgh's Black business. The website will be under constant maintenance in order to provide the best possible service! The website will have a portal for business owners to provide resources and services for them as well.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Bridging the gap between my love of food, great customer service, and painting, I started Cakes Reanimated - an in-home bakery in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Business has been booming! So much so that I decided to purchase a beautiful, historic building in the downtown area! We've contacted the local health department, approved the zoning, and were given the 'Ok-Go' on transforming this old photography studio into the custom cake shop the area is lacking! Owning my own business has been a long uphill battle, but it's been a dream! I never would have thought I could make it this far, and I still have a long way to go if I intend to open up the commercial storefront, but with your support I'm sure to succeed!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Contributions will help to fund the development of a commercial kitchen, front counter, and flooring, along with modifications to the bistro seating area and general aesthetics to the interior. All funds will be allocated according to priority.</p>
<p>First things first, get the building up to code! That includes proper flooring in the restroom and storage pantry, a partition wall breaking up the open concept floor plan and defining the kitchen area, as well as a refrigerated display counter. If we exceed our goal, funds will be used for landscaping, a new sign out front, and maybe even towards the 1987 Chevy delivery truck I purchased a while back!</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10,000 to help cover expenses. We are offering some delicious perks in exchange for your generosity - decal stickers, t-shirts, tasty treats and even a custom catering package for 300 people! </p>
<p>Not in a position to contribute, but still want to support us? Sharing our campaign via word of mouth and social media helps out tremendously! Sharing truly is caring and for that I can't thank you enough!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>After 6 years of in-home business, I am well acquainted with the struggle to maintain focus and produce quality products, especially with a less than optimal facility and inferior equipment. I love my job, but it has not been easy. The worst has been juggling creativity and maintaining a proper schedule and line of communication between my clients and myself, as well as lacking a professional space in which to meet clients. For many creatives, being organized and concise is asking you to turn on the other side of your brain. Thankfully, I have an exquisite support system of capable assistants to help fill the gaps where I am lacking. They keep me on track and make sure I'm using my talents where they best serve my company.    </p>

Our goal is to raise $10,000 to help cover expenses. We are offering some delicious perks in exchange for your generosity - decal stickers, t-shirts, tasty treats and even a custom catering package for 300 people! 
Not in a position to contribute, but still want to support us? Sharing our campaign via word of mouth and social media helps out tremendously! Sharing truly is caring and for that I can't thank you enough!
 
Risks & Challenges
After 6 years of in-home business, I am well acquainted with the struggle to maintain focus and produce quality products, especially with a less than optimal facility and inferior equipment. I love my job, but it has not been easy. The worst has been juggling creativity and maintaining a proper schedule and line of communication between my clients and myself, as well as lacking a professional space in which to meet clients. For many creatives, being organized and concise is asking you to turn on the other side of your brain. Thankfully, I have an exquisite support system of capable assistants to help fill the gaps where I am lacking. They keep me on track and make sure I'm using my talents where they best serve my company.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

 in the quaint seaside town of Niantic, CT (a small village in the Town 
of East Lyme) in the Spring of 2016. We'll be brewing lagers and ales

<li>
<b>Mike </b>is a Connecticut native and Noble Jay's Founder and Head 
Brewer.  He has been brewing for 16 year and has a special affinity for 
craft lagers.  He has a Parks and Recreation background and enjoys 
spending time on the slopes and being outside with his brewery dog 
Charlotte.  Mike works with Jesse as an Oceanograhic Survey Technician 
and has spent many a day offshore in remote parts of the U.S.</li>
<li>
<b>Jesse </b>is a Virginia Native and Noble Jay's Director of Marketing 
and Sales as well as Wearer of Many Hats.  He's a proud father of three 
kids, ocean lover, craft beer geek and outdoor enthusiast who enjoys 
trail running, surfing and rock climbing. He's also a marine geologist 
and oceanographic surveyor and has spent many days offshore with Mike 
including in the Gulf of Mexico where Noble Jay began to hatch. He 
currently serves as Director of Business Development for an 
Oceanographic Survey Firm.</li>
<li>
<b>Cori</b> is a Jersey Shore Native and Manager of Noble Jay's Tap 
Room.  She is a proud mother of three kids, ocean lover, craft beer 
lover from way back, and health and fitness nut who enjoys skiing, 
surfing and running.  Cori spent a good amount of her college days 
tending and managing bars.  She has a passion for animals and currently 
serves as a Registered Veterinary Technician.</li>
</ul><h1>Why Noble Jay</h1><p>Noble Jay Brewing Company is named in 
honor of our Founder and Brewer's mother.  Tragically Patricia Jay, know
 to her friends and family as ""Jay"", passed away from skin cancer when 
Mike was 15 months old.  With ""Patricia"" having Latin roots in 
""Nobility"" Mike decided the best way to honor his mother's memory was to
 name the brewery ""Noble Jay"" and place a discrete ""PJ'79"" in our logo.</p><h1>""The Noble Tap""

 </h1><p>It's important to us that we not only become part of Niantic 
but that we also give back.  To honor Patricia Jay's legacy and give 
back to our community, we will have a single tap in the tasting room 
dedicated as ""The Noble Tap.""  Each month, we will team with a local 
charity to which we will donate 10% of sales from The Noble Tap that 
month.</p><h1>Where</h1><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450711561/ixmxkhhvooa9hyjtwwhp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div align=""center""><i>Noble Jay will be located in the quaint coastal town of Niantic, CT</i></div>

Exit 72 of Interstate-95 and is within walking distance of Rocky Neck 
State Park - a great spot for camping and relaxing on the beach.</p><h1>The Brewery</h1><p>  Although Noble Jay will start small, our tasting room 
will have a full bar and tables where you can enjoy tastings and pints 
and fill growlers to enjoy at home.  We'll supplement our lineup of 
Noble Jay Brews with other great craft beers from our friends and 
brewers in CT. We plan for this to be a community and family gathering 
spot and will have games for adults and kids alike to enjoy.  We'll be

at the brewery for purchase.  In addition we welcome you to bring your

<p>Craft beer is the fastest growing segment of the beverage industry.  Local residents are looking for more options that are ""closer to home"".  With the revitalization of the Valley Arts District in Orange, NJ and the new Edison Village development build in West Orange, NJ, the area is primed for a quality craft brewery.</p>
<p>We expect our strongest market segments to be families who live in the greater Essex County, NJ area. Many of them are recent transplants from New York City who are looking for the quality craft beer and the hip and friendly environment they have become accustomed to.</p>
<p>Our second strongest segment is the growing number of craft beer enthusiasts who live in the area. Our tasting group, The Brew Council, began 10 years ago with only 7 members. We now have over 300 members all from word of mouth. We believe that groups like NJ Craft Beer who boast an ever increasing membership and partnerships with over 500 businesses, will only expand our influence.</p>
<p>Our last segment is college students 21 years of age and older. Essex County is home to 11 colleges and universities with Seton Hall located just under 2 1/2 miles from our proposed location.</p>

Four City Brewing will be a craft brewery located in Orange, NJ.  We will provide quality beer and build community in the increasingly underserved Essex County area.  The three of us (Roger Apollon Jr., Jeff Gattens and Anthony Minervino) are residents of West Orange, NJ and have been home brewing and hosting craft beer events for over a decade.  
With your help, we want to take our passion and experience to create a vibrant taproom. Every contribution we receive will go directly to building a space where ALL people are welcome!  A percentage of this campaign will go to a non-profit in Orange, NJ as giving back to the community is core value of our company.

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise $25,000 that will build our taproom, specifically:

Construction of bar
Tables, chairs and sofas
Lighting
Sound system
Glassware
Point of sale system
Design

We have the usual great perks like keychains, t-shirts and glassware.  We also have cool perks like personal name plaques on bar stools, tables and fermenters!

<h3>Who &amp; What is The Accidental Baker? </h3>
<p>My name is Mo and I am The Accidental Baker.</p>
<p>When my husband and I realised our dream by buying a small organic farm in Calitzdorp, South Africa, 2 years ago, we couldn’t find any real bread in our village, just those mass-produced, bleached, blanched and nutritionally deficient loaves. So I taught myself to bake sourdough bread. In-between working on the farm I would bake up to 15 loaves a day, share it with our staff, give it to friends and sell it to my neighbours. Sourdough became an addiction, slow cooking and a healthy lifestyle already part of the way we live.</p>
<p>My bread is made entirely with farmer stoneground flours milled from regionally sourced, organic and non-GMO wheat and speciality grains. I bake bread that is simple in ingredients and complex in process. I use ancient techniques in fermentation mixed with patience, time and love to make real bread.</p>
<p>What started out of need, was soon a hobby that has become a passion and a successful high-demand endeavour. With pre-orders coming 2 weeks in advance, new commercial clients ordering my bread and the opportunity to feed our local school children, I will be increasing production from 4 dozen loaves per week to 100 loaves a day! This boost is due to the fact that my customer base is expanding and diversifying. There are more and more people and businesses from outside my initial target audience who have tasted my bread and buy it. To keep up with this huge demand I am moving The Accidental Baker from my kitchen to a bigger bakehouse. My next-door neighbour has generously offered me the perfect location: the tasting room of his beautiful wine cellar that no longer is in use. This is a wondrous (bake)space, ready and waiting for my new baking equipment. </p>
<ul></ul>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<p>I am looking to raise €18,000. Your generosity will help me move the bakery into a suitable building with the space I need and upgrade my equipment with a two deck professional bakery oven, a paddle mixer, proper refrigeration and cold storage for my leavens and doughs. Other essential bakery equipment such as trolleys, racks, trays, mixing bowls and pans will also be purchased. The deck oven has the capacity to bake 8 times as many loaves as my current oven! </p>
<p>By pledging money to my crowdfunding campaign you can choose from a fantastic selection of unique perks, which include anything from donating bread in your name to the children of our local primary schools, reusable hand-dyed and hand-printed 100% cotton bread bags, tea towels and T-shirts, take part in a sourdough workshop, to an exclusive invitation for you, family and/or friends to come and stay at our farm, Lenies Hof - enjoying good food, good wine and good bread of course!</p>
<p>Support us in funding the bakery and be part of our story!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Wider Impact</h3>
<p>Like yeast – that causes the bread to rise - your support and investment multiplies the impact of the bakery! By supporting my campaign you will be ensuring that more people, as well as our school kids, will have access to the best, most nourishing bread around. Your pledge is not only an endorsement of my business but contributes to so much more. You are helping me create much needed jobs and allowing me to build and train a talented, motivated team of bakers. I will be providing apprenticeships and outreach opportunities in artisan bread-making and core business skills, ultimately helping my bakers to start their own micro bakeries. Through this campaign and the bakery, you will also be supporting our local and regional organic grain growers and millers while strengthening my network of customers, suppliers and distributors - all local small businesses that build &amp; count on one another. You are supporting what matters: the craft, art and people behind making real, good, BREAD!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In planning this project I've have been vigilant and realistic about the risks that are involved. I have determined that there are two risks that require my attention.</p>
<p>One is the possibility of insufficient funding to complete the bakery. In that case, I will fit out the bakery with only the most necessary equipment (i.e. a single deck oven instead of two deck , an under bar fridge instead of a walk-in cold storage room). This, however, will impact the bakery by lowering production and efficiency, requiring me to adapt my baking methods, training opportunities, and business scope accordingly.</p>
<p>The second risk is the possibility of insufficient demand to maintain sustainability and business viability. I believe this is a low-risk because The Accidental Baker already enjoys an established reputation for quality and service, with a loyal customer base, which continues to grow every day. I have planned a series of marketing campaigns to promote the bakery, increasing people’s awareness and access to my bread, while creating new partnerships for distribution to ensure the success of the bakery. Additional income will accrue from the sale of bread baking related merchandise and through bread-making workshops, education and training activities.</p>
<p>Once my funding goal is reached, I will be able to completely re-fit the new bakery with all of the desired equipment so we can make a flying start! Anything above my campaign target will allow me to develop new products, packaging and distribution materials to reach an even wider audience. </p>

</h3>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<div><b>Car Finder:</b></div>
<h3></h3>
<p>There are basically two parts to this gadget -- the keyfob and the shark fin unit. When the keyfob is activated (depressing on the switch in the keyfob) it sends out a signal to the base unit within a fraction of a second. That in turn activates the LED light and a distinct sound which is far from noisy but easy to hear even in a crowded area.</p>
<p>While light is being illuminated along with distinct sound, the Keyfobs vibrator continues to vibrate while the small flashing light illuminates and only gets brighter. The vibrator becomes more rapid as the owner of the car finder approaches the unit. Once the remote is within 20 feet, the unit shuts itself off saving important battery life.</p>

<p>There are basically two parts to this gadget -- the keyfob and the shark fin unit. When the keyfob is activated (depressing on the switch in the keyfob) it sends out a signal to the base unit within a fraction of a second. That in turn activates the LED light and a distinct sound which is far from noisy but easy to hear even in a crowded area.</p>
<p>While light is being illuminated along with distinct sound, the Keyfobs vibrator continues to vibrate while the small flashing light illuminates and only gets brighter. The vibrator becomes more rapid as the owner of the car finder approaches the unit. Once the remote is within 20 feet, the unit shuts itself off saving important battery life.</p>

statutory agencies, makes available a range of services that target individuals
and families who are less likely to engage with mainstream provision and that
aim to develop skills, confidence, self-esteem and above all, opportunity.  </p>
<p>The aim of this campaign is to support the centre by providing
funding to allow much needed services to continue running, and to help maintain
the purpose-built building. </p>
<p>The staff are a cornerstone of the community, working
tirelessly to lend a helpful and caring hand to those who reach out for one.</p>
<p>Funding from the government is minimal, with an unrealistic
amount available being provided in an expensive time where local charities are expendable.</p>

</div></div>","The Family Centre is a registered Charity based in New
Addington, on the Eastern fringe of Croydon and bordering Bromley, in an area
characterised by high levels of social deprivation. 

However, beneath this deprivation we believe that there is
potential; potential for individuals to shine, for babies, children and young
people to achieve their dreams and for our community to thrive.
The Family Centre, working in partnership with voluntary and
statutory agencies, makes available a range of services that target individuals
and families who are less likely to engage with mainstream provision and that
aim to develop skills, confidence, self-esteem and above all, opportunity.  
The aim of this campaign is to support the centre by providing
funding to allow much needed services to continue running, and to help maintain
the purpose-built building. 
The staff are a cornerstone of the community, working
tirelessly to lend a helpful and caring hand to those who reach out for one.
Funding from the government is minimal, with an unrealistic
amount available being provided in an expensive time where local charities are expendable.
We are not asking a lot. For a simple donation of 5 pounds a
person, we may save the building and its ambitions.
   What We Need & What You Get 
The Family
Centre needs your support to help raise £150,000.  Monies raised will go towards:
·  Existing services including Children’s cookery, Stay and Play, Healthy Lunch Club, Health initiatives, Garden Projects, Peer to peer support sessions, Family Support Services, Counselling, Parenting programmes, under 5’s physical activities programme.
·  Building maintenance
·  New projects including Mentoring, Dad’s and Male Carers Project, Adult cookery sessions, Community developer, intergenerational project embracing all ages, exercise/healthy living programme.
·  Overheads including utility bills
·  Play equipment for children and families
·  Covering necessary Insurance policies
With your support the good work would continue long into 2016, and have a resounding impact on the community and the lives within it.
 

The Impact
 The Family Centre was a pioneering institution that has been supporting families and residents of Fieldway
and New Addington, as well as people from outside the borough, for 16 years.  
During this time, we have had the privilege to watch the community take ownership
of their surroundings and grow together making New Addington and Fieldway a better place to live.  With a dedicated staff team made up of local residents, we take pride in
making the Family Centre a welcoming place to be.

We lived our daily life as usual. But a doggy injured bumped in. We took the doggy to a pet hospital. The doctor asked what the doggy's name is, and we, of course, did know and could not help it at all. Then the hospital insisted that we need to pay medical fee for 7 days in advance, even though we provided our ID and contact details. We understood the concern from the hospital: No one knows if you will pay for a stray dog.Stray dog, that's not its name. We want every pet to be known its name. And more importantly, we can reach its raiser. An happy ending of pet and raiser union is what we are looking forward to.And this goal can be reached by Petlinc NFC tag, where you can save your pet's name and which you can locate your pet.Please join us to realize this ideal pet world!

<div>Toys have always been a part of my life. Some kids had lemonade stands - I had a toy stand and sold or traded my toys with the neighbor kids. I really can't think back to a time in my life when I didn't have some around the house, work, car, what have you. In the late 80s I started looking into vintage toys - Now vintage to me at the time was the late 60s - early 70s. The stuff I played with as a kid. I discovered a whole community of collectors and dealers across the country that were into older ""collectible"" toys. As my passion for toys grew so did my inventory and I started doing mail order on the side from my regular job. One thing led to another and I soon became a full time toy dealer - opening my retail doors in 1993 on NE Glisan Street, in Portland Oregon.  I ran that store for 13 years (moving to a larger space in 1995 on lower E. Burnside).  2005 came around and it was time to move on and close the store. Slowing sales, diminished inventory and personal reason forced me to close. It was heartbreaking!</div>
<div>Over the years, I have ran into many old friends and customers that have told me my store still lives on in their memories. The legend of Dr. Tongues has survived.</div>
<div>Skip ahead 10 years and my passion for toys is still here. The collectible community has grown and expanded and I feel it is time to re-launch Dr. Tongues into the next decade! </div>
<div>But - I need a little help from you, my past and future customers, fans, &amp; well wishers to achieve this goal. I am asking for a vote of confidence in me to launch a new store by helping me raise the desired cashola, with your contributions, to buy some kick ass glass display cases and a small bank of venture capital for once again amassing a larger more spectacular inventory than before (if that is possible)! </div> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">There is no free lunch!</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <ul> <li>With this campaign, I am looking to raise $6500.00. The larger wall cases I am looking at are $1500 each (need 2 of those), with smaller counter cases running $300.00 each (4 of those are needed). That will leave $2300.00 for start up capital/inventory. </li> <li>Hey what do I get for the effort? Well I will tell you. I have arranged to have some great Dr. Tongues logo tchotchkes produced (featuring our mascot - Dr. Skele Tongue!) as incentives to get people to pony up some dough! These are all quality items made by our friends at Creepy Cult In Tacoma (made local &amp; bought local)! Check them out!!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>I really do need your help!</h3> <ul>
<li>I really want to make Dr. Tongues 2.0 something special for not only Portland but for essentially the world! It sounds ambitious and it really is. A lot of my old customers have kids now - I would like to have a store where they can bring them, hang out, talk toys and make a memory for generations to come. The original store was known worldwide and  many people visited Portland and came to see the Good Doctors abode.  People as well as celebrities over the years, from bands to actors and actresses came, saw, and bought memories.

the 
Extra Mile Newspaper that we would earn a grant for $150,000.00 in order
 to build the Extra Mile Newspaper in New Albany, MS. All we needed to 
do is secure 250 votes and the grant was ours. We not only secured 
the 250 votes, but earned an additional 13 to take the Extra Mile 
Newspaper 
over the limit required to 263 votes. When the appropriate time came 
around to be awarded, not only were we refused the grant, but an 
explanation was unavailable and they left the Extra Mile Newspaper in 
the dark as to why we 
were refused the grant award after completing the required tasks. 
Anybody could come up 
with 1 million reasons to why, but we have decided to move forward with 
our social media friends, our family members, North Mississippi 
residents, and West Tennessee residents as

economy, survive those that believe in big dollars, and overlook the burdens of middle 
class and poor in America is for Americans across the globe to build and
 grow together from the ground up. The growth that is formed from the air down 
is bound to have a disastrous collapse, and will eventually tumble and crash.

<p>My name is Nick Kwan, and I am the Vice President of World Wide Imports, the
business my parents started nearly 40 years ago.  We are manufactures and
designers of pearl and gem stone jewelry, which many of you have seen if you
shop department stores or watch TV shopping networks.  </p>
</div><div>Over the last 13 years that I have been involved in the daily operations, I
have been searching for creative and impactful way to give back to our
community and the charities in- which our family has donated to passionately
over the years.  Fast forward to today, our good friend Jim Na has been
honored as a candidate for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s Man &amp; Woman
of the Year fundraising campaign and set a goal to raise $100,000 over the
course of the next 3 weeks.  In his own words, he has been “given an
opportunity of a lifetime to help others.”  The profits from this campaign
will support the LLS mission to find cures for blood cancers and assist
patients and families as they battle the disease.  Currently, leukemia
causes more deaths than any other cancer among children under the age of
20.  The picture that we chose for the campaign is a picture of the Na
family with Lucy, who at 6 years old has already gone through more than most of
us!  <p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There are many reasons to be proud to support LLS’s efforts.  For
instance, nearly 40% of new cancer therapies approved by the FDA between 2000
and 2013 were first approved for blood cancer patients, benefiting all cancer
patients. Since LLS’s inception 65 years ago, cures for many patients with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin’s lymphoma have been achieved. Since
the 1960s, five-year survival rates for many blood cancer patients have
doubled, tripled or even quadrupled. </p>
<p>This is an organization that is doing the right things with the dollars it
raises, and we are proud to be associated with Jim’s campaign for the Leukemia
&amp; Lymphoma Society. </p>
<p>Like Jim, we feel we are being given an opportunity of a lifetime to help
others and are honored to contribute to his fundraising goal.  That being
said, in honor of LLS and to help contribute to the campaign goal, our company
has pledged 2 items from our collection to help the Na Family move closer to
their goal of $100,000.  For each of
these items, 100% of the profits will go towards the Na Family fundraising
goal.  Item 1 is a 9-10 millimeter fresh water
pearl necklace that has been dyed to a red color, hand knotted and strung on a
silver clasp.  Item 2 is an 8” 10-11 millimeter white freshwater pearl
bracelet which has also been hand knotted and strung with a sterling silver
clasp. </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Why a pearl?  The pearl is globally recognized as a symbol of hope and
shares the story of strength, perseverance, and inspiration.  When a pearl
is formed naturally or cultured, layers of pearl nacre are formed to surround
an outside irritant such as a grain of sand as a defense mechanism.  Over
time, the mollusk will form enough layers, creating a beautiful gem.  </p>
<p>Regardless of whether we reach our fundraising goal we will donate 100% of
the profits of these items towards The Na family’s fundraising effort. 
However, if we surpass our set goal of $20,000, the donation amount will climb
an additional 5% as the Indigogo handling fees will drop! While we have set the goal at $20,000, it is our hope that we can raise much more! </p>
<p>If pearls are not for you, we only ask that you pass this around to
your family and friends to help us with our efforts!  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!! </p>

family with Lucy, who at 6 years old has already gone through more than most of
us!  


There are many reasons to be proud to support LLS’s efforts.  For
instance, nearly 40% of new cancer therapies approved by the FDA between 2000
and 2013 were first approved for blood cancer patients, benefiting all cancer
patients. Since LLS’s inception 65 years ago, cures for many patients with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin’s lymphoma have been achieved. Since
the 1960s, five-year survival rates for many blood cancer patients have
doubled, tripled or even quadrupled. 
This is an organization that is doing the right things with the dollars it
raises, and we are proud to be associated with Jim’s campaign for the Leukemia
& Lymphoma Society. 
Like Jim, we feel we are being given an opportunity of a lifetime to help
others and are honored to contribute to his fundraising goal.  That being
said, in honor of LLS and to help contribute to the campaign goal, our company
has pledged 2 items from our collection to help the Na Family move closer to
their goal of $100,000.  For each of
these items, 100% of the profits will go towards the Na Family fundraising
goal.  Item 1 is a 9-10 millimeter fresh water
pearl necklace that has been dyed to a red color, hand knotted and strung on a
silver clasp.  Item 2 is an 8” 10-11 millimeter white freshwater pearl
bracelet which has also been hand knotted and strung with a sterling silver
clasp. 




Why a pearl?  The pearl is globally recognized as a symbol of hope and
shares the story of strength, perseverance, and inspiration.  When a pearl
is formed naturally or cultured, layers of pearl nacre are formed to surround
an outside irritant such as a grain of sand as a defense mechanism.  Over
time, the mollusk will form enough layers, creating a beautiful gem.  
Regardless of whether we reach our fundraising goal we will donate 100% of
the profits of these items towards The Na family’s fundraising effort. 
However, if we surpass our set goal of $20,000, the donation amount will climb
an additional 5% as the Indigogo handling fees will drop! While we have set the goal at $20,000, it is our hope that we can raise much more! 
If pearls are not for you, we only ask that you pass this around to
your family and friends to help us with our efforts!  

Thank you!!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Before we reveal the rest of the

<p>A trip down a long forgotten dream. </p>
<p>A <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">dream about a kingdom built by you,
devised by your own mettle, functioning to perfection. A beautiful place it
was, where imagination ran wild and free. A rare haven it was, where the value
of things was decided by the love with which they were created.</span></p>

did a rather impressive job of building this kingdom.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Do you still visit this beautiful
place that you created? If not, when and why did you give it up? Did it seem
strange in the light of the 'real' world? Were you told that it was childish,
unreal, or impractical? Did you then make adjustments, rub your eyes, and wake
up to the doldrums of a world that always tells you what you must dream and
what you must do? </p>
<p>Here's what we'll tell you. The most
important take-back from those early dreams, is that <i>you </i>wanted to build something. You had a vision and you created. Or
hoped to create some day. Your vision, your hope, and the talent that gave you
the vision in the first place, are the building blocks of your success. They
also happen to be the building blocks of America. The makers of a national spirit
that believes in talent, skill and endeavor over and above the stamp of success
on paper. </p>

Ann is a young American entrepreneur
with a dream of running her own coffee shop.
Good with the oven and sharp with
the ideas, Ann set up shop and went about developing an exciting range of
goodies.
However, Ann - and her coffee shop -
were soon in a spot of bother. The demands of advertising, both online and
offline, were making it difficult for Ann to focus on coming up with a creative
menu. She did what the books told her to do – approach a large advertising firm
with a formidable portfolio of work. 

But of course they
were too expensive. They also had their own way of going about things, making it
difficult for Ann to ensure that she got things done the way she wanted. 





  So what happened to Ann's Coffee Shop? 
Before we reveal the rest of the
story, let us take you on a short trip.
A trip down a long forgotten dream. 
A dream about a kingdom built by you,
devised by your own mettle, functioning to perfection. A beautiful place it
was, where imagination ran wild and free. A rare haven it was, where the value
of things was decided by the love with which they were created.


And you, the child with the dreams,
did a rather impressive job of building this kingdom.



Do you still visit this beautiful
place that you created? If not, when and why did you give it up? Did it seem
strange in the light of the 'real' world? Were you told that it was childish,
unreal, or impractical? Did you then make adjustments, rub your eyes, and wake
up to the doldrums of a world that always tells you what you must dream and
what you must do? 
Here's what we'll tell you. The most
important take-back from those early dreams, is that you wanted to build something. You had a vision and you created. Or
hoped to create some day. Your vision, your hope, and the talent that gave you
the vision in the first place, are the building blocks of your success. They
also happen to be the building blocks of America. The makers of a national spirit
that believes in talent, skill and endeavor over and above the stamp of success
on paper. 



The vision
behind Rookiework stems
from, and centers on, the hundreds of thousands of American dreamers like you,
with brilliant ideas that deserve to be implemented.
As such, Rookiework has been conceptualized
as a community of people with dreams, and people with the skills to help them realize
those dreams.
Let’s get to know this community

I have attended countless burials of young people, my age-mates and former friends who died either from the crimes, violence or effects of drugs and substance abuse. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Your contribution will go a long way to make this tried and tested model deliver great results.</span><br/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our Campaign Implementation Approach</b><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433358240/vykxcyjotcwjcru9pqcy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>#YouthEntrepreneurshipForChangeCampaign will serve as a platform for youth to: <b>share experiences,</b> <b>learn skills</b> and <b>network</b> with like-minded young people and most importantly potential markets and procuring entities for their products and serves. This platform will <b>offer linkages</b> to some employment opportunities, decent lifestyles and an alternative to crimes and violence to the young people and long-lasting solutions and potential growth to self-sustainability. <div>

<p>Through #YouthEntrepreneurshipForChangeCampaign, I will use my past experience and networks to promote youth entrepreneurship and Youth Access Government and other Procurement Opportunities which is set aside as 30% reservation for youth owned business and enterprises. This is an untapped viable option as the opportunities and choices are endless.

Right? This is a true state in various parts of the world though the scale and magnitude might differ.As a Youth Champion and Young Entrepreneur, I believe young people have a very big influence in development. I have for the past over 7 years volunteered, served, worked for and with young people in Kenya through personal, government and even donor funded programs that aimed to address some of the aforementioned issues. Why #YouthEntrepreneurshipForChangeCampaign?75% of youth remain unemployed as the opportunities are slim and often require prior experience that most learning institutions don't offer. For youth to venture into business, the requirements are far beyond reach; financial institutions have avoided lending to youth due to their relative inability to comply with the high transaction costs, difficulty in accessing and managing their risk profiles and lack of the required financial documentation as well as collateral.Most of my friends, neighbors and other young people I know have resulted to mugging pedestrians, some have ended up in violent crimes including armed robberies and a vast range of criminal activities all in the name of survival and earning a living. Terrorism has crept in among other desperate young people who end up radicalized and turning against their own country for retaliation due to the lack of opportunities compared to the incentives offered by their recruiters. Drug and Substance abuse has also been evident and street peddling on the rise. I have attended countless burials of young people, my age-mates and former friends who died either from the crimes, violence or effects of drugs and substance abuse. Your contribution will go a long way to make this tried and tested model deliver great results.Our Campaign Implementation Approach#YouthEntrepreneurshipForChangeCampaign will serve as a platform for youth to: share experiences, learn skills and network with like-minded young people and most importantly potential markets and procuring entities for their products and serves. This platform will offer linkages to some employment opportunities, decent lifestyles and an alternative to crimes and violence to the young people and long-lasting solutions and potential growth to self-sustainability. 
Government, corporates and private owned institutions and departments will be brought to this platform to interact with young people who will be displaying their skills, wares and products looking for engagements and networking to improve the financial situation of young people.
Through #YouthEntrepreneurshipForChangeCampaign, I will use my past experience and networks to promote youth entrepreneurship and Youth Access Government and other Procurement Opportunities which is set aside as 30% reservation for youth owned business and enterprises. This is an untapped viable option as the opportunities and choices are endless. The reserved opportunities for youth that are attainable include; supplies of stationery, ICT hardware/software, accessories and consumables, toiletries, detergents, newspapers, design and printing services, decorations, event organization and services, car wash services, tree seedlings supply, cleaning services, carpet cleaning, hire of Public Address Systems among other low cost, achievable, hands on and less technical deliverables.
#YouthEntrepreneurshipForChangeCampaign will ultimately deliver on job trainings, skills development for young people on how to access financial independence opportunities, enhance their skills and ultimately support those among them willing to start and operate their own skill based initiatives and sale of products. 
Technology will be key in delivering results in this campaign;use of new media and the on-line portal to access procurement opportunities and other platforms  which as young people we can access through our mobile gadgets will be used to enhance reach and support of the program.

the long run provides a more relational and cost effective approach to 
transformation as opposed to incarceration. Denver Colorado/Denver

<h3>Our ORGANIC SEA-MINT TEAS</h3>
<p>All of our organic Seaweed tea varieties use wild-harvested Bladderwrack seaweed.  Bladderwrack is also known as Fucus Vesiculus &amp; has been used medicinally for centuries, especially for the stimulation of the thyroid gland as a treatment for <strong>obesity</strong> and <strong>cellulite</strong>. The high <strong>iodine</strong> content of the brown algae stimulates thyroid function which <strong>boosts the metabolism</strong> &amp; assists in weight-loss.  Bladderwrack has a reputation for use in the relief of rheumatism and rheumatoid <strong>arthritis</strong> and may be used both internally and as an external application for inflamed joints.  It is said to <strong>soothe</strong> the irritated tissues of the body.  Seaweeds contain 10-100X the concentration of vitamins &amp; minerals, as compared with vegetation on land. It is rich in iodine, <strong>calcium</strong>, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfur, silicon and iron and high in some B-complex vitamins that include B2 &amp; B3. It contains moderate amounts of phosphorus, <strong>selenium</strong>, manganese and zinc and small amounts of vitamins A, C, E and G. It also contains anti-sterility vitamin S as well as vitamin K.  Best part - we include the SEAWEED TEA in almost EVERY perk!</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are...

When we opened 'little organic' thalassotherapy spa in 2011 in a small community in Eastern Ontario, we were floored by the positive reception from everyone. We knew we had something that Canadians loved as much as we did when by mid-summer we were booked 6 weeks in advance with a waiting list. After a few years of a very successful and busy operation, unfortunately things changed drastically when one of the owners, Ria, developed Stage 4 Cervical Cancer and a seven-inch tumour had to be surgically removed, along with rounds of chemotherapy and radiation. This meant a very long rehabilitation for Ria and a change of plan. the video for THIS campaign is PRIOR to Ria's official diagnosis. Ria was rushed to EMERGENCY and finally stayed in the hospital for over a month. Soon after the news, a tremendous amount of support poured in from all sides of the planet, it was outstanding. However, we knew we had to make a decision on how things should turn out and to maintain a healthier lifestyle so that Ria could fully recuperate from the post effects of the treatments. We started an online campaign and raised enough $ to send Ria out to the BC coast for a good part of the summer. It was there she was able to spend time on the ocean and take time for herself to heal. It was as quick as she got there, her energy was up, her appetite was amazing and her laugh was stronger than ever. It was clear to both Ria and Rod that it was time to come back to the place where it all began for them, beautiful Vancouver, BC. With a lot of momentum behind us, we are elated to be able to offer these therapies to local Lower Mainland-ers as more and more Canadians come to know the amazing resources we have in this abundant country and the powerful healing benefits of real, raw, ocean therapy. 

TODAY - Ria is dealing with the POST-effects of the treatments and surgery. Her lymphnodes were removed leaving her with debilitating edema starting in her LEFT leg, so she is unable to walk very far - which is what she loves to do most. The seaweed treatments really help, however we haven't been able to get what she needs due to LACK of funds. So unfortunately she is not getting the best help of whats out there.

She is unable to work full time or do much and applied for disability however that doesn't kick in for 4-5 months. We are hoping to help her get better so she doesn't need disability and can walk and balance her body again. it is possible and we do know the tools - we just need the funds to BUY the tools.

</h3>Glenrothes, with its surrounding villages, has a population of 50,000 
but has no  dedicated tennis courts. Glenrothes Tennis
 Club has operated successfully for three years without courts, but it is expensive to hire facilities and we need to book the indoor sports hall and , in summer, the single tennis/multi-purpose court at the local leisure centre, months in advance. But during school terms we manage to coach weekly. We are only able to participate in leagues and tournaments because they take place at other tennis clubs. We now need our 
own courts so that all members can fulfil their potential and we can 
provide sporting opportunities for the local community. If we can reach 
enough people, who would be willing to donate even £1, it would help us 
achieve our ambition. Please donate, and please spread the word. Thank 
you.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Contributions<br/>
</h3> <p>Any contributions are warmly welcomed, the money will go:</p> <ul> <li>Straight into the savings we currently have - raised through monthly bag-packing and our annual ceilidh and other regular fundraising events.<br/>
</li> <li>This money is being raised solely towards funding the building of our club courts<br/>
</li> <li>£1000 may seem rather high, but we expect the cost of 3 courts with floodlights to be around £150,000. We will be applying for a SportScotland grant, but will have to match 25% of whatever they award us. If they give us £80,000 we will have to raise £20,000, so that we then have a total of £100,000. We will also need to apply for lots of other grants and hopefully will receive some money from the LTA.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Our build will include:</p> <ul>
<li>Initially 3 flood-lit courts.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Membership Base<br/>
</h3> <p>So far, we:<br/> </p> <ul> <li>Run a successful 3-tier weekly coaching session. This includes beginners, intermediates and then advanced. The age range included within our coaching programme is from 5 years old upwards.<br/>
</li> <li>Enter our adult members into regular social leagues against nearby clubs from Fife and Tayside during the summer. Over the winter the adults compete in the Tayside Tennis Indoor Winter League.</li>
<li>Enter our young members (5-18) into tournaments in N.E.Fife during the summer holidays.</li>
</ul>
<p>We would love to do more, including holding our own competitions. However, the absence of courts means there is a restriction on the progression and development of players. We work hard with our coach to get the best tennis out of our members and at the same time have fun. With our own facilities we would be able to cater for a wider range of age and ability and we could offer coaching on a variety of days, including during school holidays, in order to accommodate more coaching members. We would also be able to offer the opportunity for organised and casual social play, which would enable our members to improve  and develop at a much faster rate than is currently possible. We would also be able to offer the use of our facilities to the local community and we would be able to provide a healthy form of outdoor exercise for residents from the deprived areas of Glenrothes.<br/></p>

 Club has operated successfully for three years without courts, but it is expensive to hire facilities and we need to book the indoor sports hall and , in summer, the single tennis/multi-purpose court at the local leisure centre, months in advance. But during school terms we manage to coach weekly. We are only able to participate in leagues and tournaments because they take place at other tennis clubs. We now need our 
own courts so that all members can fulfil their potential and we can 
provide sporting opportunities for the local community. If we can reach 
enough people, who would be willing to donate even £1, it would help us 
achieve our ambition. Please donate, and please spread the word. Thank 
you.
  Contributions
 Any contributions are warmly welcomed, the money will go:  Straight into the savings we currently have - raised through monthly bag-packing and our annual ceilidh and other regular fundraising events.
 This money is being raised solely towards funding the building of our club courts
 £1000 may seem rather high, but we expect the cost of 3 courts with floodlights to be around £150,000. We will be applying for a SportScotland grant, but will have to match 25% of whatever they award us. If they give us £80,000 we will have to raise £20,000, so that we then have a total of £100,000. We will also need to apply for lots of other grants and hopefully will receive some money from the LTA.
    The Impact Our build will include: 
Initially 3 flood-lit courts.    Membership Base
 So far, we:   Run a successful 3-tier weekly coaching session. This includes beginners, intermediates and then advanced. The age range included within our coaching programme is from 5 years old upwards.
 Enter our adult members into regular social leagues against nearby clubs from Fife and Tayside during the summer. Over the winter the adults compete in the Tayside Tennis Indoor Winter League.
Enter our young members (5-18) into tournaments in N.E.Fife during the summer holidays.

We would love to do more, including holding our own competitions. However, the absence of courts means there is a restriction on the progression and development of players. We work hard with our coach to get the best tennis out of our members and at the same time have fun. With our own facilities we would be able to cater for a wider range of age and ability and we could offer coaching on a variety of days, including during school holidays, in order to accommodate more coaching members. We would also be able to offer the opportunity for organised and casual social play, which would enable our members to improve  and develop at a much faster rate than is currently possible. We would also be able to offer the use of our facilities to the local community and we would be able to provide a healthy form of outdoor exercise for residents from the deprived areas of Glenrothes.

<b>Hello my name is Daniel</b>,</h3>
<p>And
I am a rope access technician. This job requires a lot of travelling across
Europe. I really like the work on the ropes, so unfortunately there are only a
few days per month which I can spend with my family. </p>
<p>My
children are 3 and 5 years old, it's a beautiful age where they discover the
world, develop and grow, I am thrilled by the honesty a child words express and
it contributes to a new perspectives on a lot of things for myself. I'd like to
share more time with my children and find a way to connect both, the love for
my work and being with them.</p>
<p>For this reason I would like to join the fast growing market of 3D
printing. As part of my apprenticeship as an industrial mechanic I learned how
to use 3D software to create 3D objects. </p>
<p>With
this knowledge I would like to start a new business from home, to generate a
second income which allows me to explore the world with my children and become
a father who is more than a couple of days a month at home.</p>
<p>Since I discovered 3-D printing a couple of years ago I am very
fascinated from the idea to print everything you need just at home. </p>
<p>All I need is a 3D printer to start my new future. As a freelancer the
problems and risks on a free market (especially in Europe) are already a part
of my normal work routine. Rope access is a challenging job which requires a
lot of planning and creativity. Combined with good nerves this is the best base
to create a business.</p>
<p>I have the possibility to work as a rope access instructor ~10 days a
month in my area, which means I am able to pay my rent and only need to fill
the rest of the month with printing jobs.</p>
<p>There are several crowd printing platforms where I am registered and
already found potential customers. Additionally I already have a lot of ideas
which market gaps in my area I can fill with my 3D printed goods.</p>

<div><br/></div>
<p>Geps Techno fait appel à votre soutien pour l'aider à construire une plateforme flottante unique au monde.</p>
<p>Combinant le soleil, le vent, la houle et le courant, le MLiner s'adapte aux contraintes d'approvisionnement en électricité des sites isolés, îles, et presqu'îles. Ce projet constitue également une solution pour les besoins énergétiques ponctuellement accrus sur des zones côtières, dans le cadre de situations d'urgence ou d'évènements exceptionnels.  </p>
<p>Le MLiner répond à des problématiques de taille du XXIème siècle en offrant une nouvelle technologie respectueuse de l'environnement s'inscrivant dans la lutte contre le changement climatique et en permettant l'accès à l'électricité dans des endroits d'accès difficiles, jusqu'alors très dépendants des énergies carbonées.</p>

<div>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Le MLiner est une plateforme flottante qui combine </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">quatre technologies de récupération de l'énergie</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">: le houlomoteur (énergie des vagues), l'hydrolien (énergie des courants), l'éolien et le solaire. Ce concept est né en 2011 et est à l'origine de la création du groupe GEPS la même année. </span></p>

<div>L'<b>objectif du projet</b> est d'alimenter des systèmes autonomes en mer, des îles, des régions isolées... encore dépendantes aujourd'hui des énergies fossiles.</div>
<div>La conception même du MLiner permet d'éviter l'intermittence de la production d'énergie grâce à la combinaison (aussi appelée hybridation) de quatre sources:</div>

<p><b>Chaque sous-système a été optimisé par GEPS de manière à s'intégrer parfaitement dans la structure du MLiner</b>: les éoliennes, hydroliennes et panneaux solaires ont été choisis parmi des technologies existantes, et une série de tests a permis de définir la configuration la plus adaptée.</p>

<p>Rangé dans un sac avec l’annexe, ce banc
peut être installé facilement sur tout type d’annexe pour voilier. Au mouillage
ou pendant plusieurs journées de navigation, le banc vous permet d’exploiter
votre annexe pour fournir de l’électricité verte ! Le banc est en effet
équipé d’un système de relevage mécanique simple, et des turbines rangées sous
ce dernier peuvent être déployées en l’air (éoliennes) ou dans l’eau
(hydroliennes) et venir recharger une batterie. La batterie, quant à elle, peut
servir soit à alimenter le moteur de l’annexe dans le cas d’une propulsion
électrique, soit à fournir de l’énergie de bord au voilier.</p>
<p>GEPS a également prévu d’exploiter
l’énergie solaire : lorsque le banc est relevé, une toile solaire peut
être fixée sur les montants du banc de chaque côté de l’annexe, et étendue
jusqu’à l’avant du bateau. Un système de lattes similaires à celles présentes
dans une voile classique permet de maintenir la forme de la toile solaire en
cas de vent.</p>

<p>L’Eco-Tender est une annexe pour yacht respectueuse de
l’environnement. Conçu pour des balades silencieuses dans des environnements
naturels souvent sensibles, l’éco-tender fonctionne exclusivement à l’énergie
électrique. Cette énergie est générée par un système de production hybride, qui
exploite le vent et le soleil. </p>
<p>L’Eco-Tender est équipé d'un salon permettant de partager des moments de convivialité dans des cadres exceptionnels et dans des conditions optimales . Son toit et ses éoliennes peuvent être rétractés à l’arrêt afin de faciliter le stockage de
l’annexe sur votre navire principal.</p>

<div><b>GEPS, c'est déjà une entreprise. Pourquoi avez-vous besoin de l'argent de particuliers? Pourquoi soutenir ce projet?</b></div>
<div></div>
<p>Les différents concours que nous avons remportés, la
reconnaissance des médias et les partenariats nous ont apporté de la visibilité
et de la crédibilité, mais pas de fonds propres. Ces fonds propres privés
(capital principalement) nous sont nécessaires pour que les financeurs publics
qui peuvent accompagner notre développement (Etat français, Europe, DOE USA)
acceptent de nous subventionner ou de nous prêter des fonds.</p>
<p>Les fonds propres privés peuvent provenir de fonds
d’investissements ou d’industriels : ces actionnaires ont leur propre
stratégie qui peut nous faire dévier de notre cible initiale. En récoltant des
fonds de manière participative, nous conservons notre indépendance et pouvons
décider nous-même des choix technologiques et stratégiques qui nous paraissent
les plus justes. </p>

C’est la raison pour
laquelle nous faisons appel au crowdfunding. Notre projet est innovant et
insolite, et nous avons d'ores et déjà les clés organisationnelles et
technologiques permettant sa réalisation: avec votre aide, nous pourrons
arriver au bout.<div></div>

<h2>Snapshot of the project</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Geps Techno
is working on a prototype that is the first of its kind in the renewable energy
world. Putting together wind, sun, current and wave energy, it is built to
adapt to the changes of the 21<sup>st</sup> century with climate change
becoming such a real concern. There are still places without electricity in
this world, and this current project could help supply energy to places that
are small enough. But this is only the beginning, with this prototype funded,
we will be able to build a larger MLiner that will power larger places! This
project can help substitute the unclean power sources and can power most
unreachable places, that never thought they could have electricity before. </p>So join us, as we help
innovate the future of renewable energy!</div>
<div>Also, if you feel concerned about the climate change and energy transition, join in our project and help us achieve this hybrid innovation. To do this, simply press the ""CONTRIBUTE NOW"" button. (It will say that you need a paypal account, we assure you that you do not, look under the ""Updates"" section to see how to get past this).</div>
<div>You will be able to donate starting at €1, this will let you participate in the development of clean energy technology and you will receive recognition in a collage image of the MLiner!</div>

<p>As mentioned in the video, the campaign will add on other funds that we are gathering to reach our financial goal: the total cost for the building of the MLiner is 10 Million euros. </p>
<p>We make use of a crowdfunding campaign for several reasons:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>To keep our<b> financial independence </b>as well as a complete control of our   technology and projects by limiting investment funds inflows.</li>
<li>Broadcast to the general public the implication of our company in the <b>fight against climate change</b>, and <b>encourage the development of participatory funding</b>, which allows to concretize projects that meet the citizens' expectations.</li>
<li>
<b>Diversify</b> our equity and have a<b> lever effect</b>, which guarantees our project's success.

When the boat is unused, the bench can be unfolded above the dinghy’s transom which releases the two retractable turbines initially stored under the bench. Those turbines can be fixed on top
of the bench or upside down under the transom, depending on sea and wind conditions. The bench comes with a roll up solar panels to attach to the side of your dinghy so you can receive as much green electricity as possible!</span>


The bench is in a
V-shape to make it as comfortable as possible for you when you paddle or
sale.  Overall, this hybrid bench is very
beneficial because of the many uses it can bring to the owner.

Le projet en quelques mots

Geps Techno fait appel à votre soutien pour l'aider à construire une plateforme flottante unique au monde.
Combinant le soleil, le vent, la houle et le courant, le MLiner s'adapte aux contraintes d'approvisionnement en électricité des sites isolés, îles, et presqu'îles. Ce projet constitue également une solution pour les besoins énergétiques ponctuellement accrus sur des zones côtières, dans le cadre de situations d'urgence ou d'évènements exceptionnels.  
Le MLiner répond à des problématiques de taille du XXIème siècle en offrant une nouvelle technologie respectueuse de l'environnement s'inscrivant dans la lutte contre le changement climatique et en permettant l'accès à l'électricité dans des endroits d'accès difficiles, jusqu'alors très dépendants des énergies carbonées.
Si vous aussi vous vous sentez concernés par le changement climatique et la transition énergétique, rejoignez notre projet et aidez nous à concrétiser cette innovation hybride. Pour cela, il vous suffit d'appuyer sur le bouton CONTRIBUER MAINTENANT (cela n'implique pas la création d'un compte Paypal). 
Vous pourrez ainsi dès 1€, participer au développement des énergies propres et recevoir une contrepartie à l'image du MLiner.



Les contreparties: le porte-clé flotteur, le T-shirt, la tasse auto-touilleuse, le porte-stylo, l'Opinel Outdoor multi-fonctions, le pack blouson/casquette, le poster


Les contreparties spéciales: Le banc hybride pour annexe, l'éco-tender, le MLiner

Le projet MLiner
Le MLiner: histoire et impact du projet

Le MLiner est une plateforme flottante qui combine quatre technologies de récupération de l'énergie: le houlomoteur (énergie des vagues), l'hydrolien (énergie des courants), l'éolien et le solaire. Ce concept est né en 2011 et est à l'origine de la création du groupe GEPS la même année. 


L'objectif du projet est d'alimenter des systèmes autonomes en mer, des îles, des régions isolées... encore dépendantes aujourd'hui des énergies fossiles.
La conception même du MLiner permet d'éviter l'intermittence de la production d'énergie grâce à la combinaison (aussi appelée hybridation) de quatre sources:




Chaque sous-système a été optimisé par GEPS de manière à s'intégrer parfaitement dans la structure du MLiner: les éoliennes, hydroliennes et panneaux solaires ont été choisis parmi des technologies existantes, et une série de tests a permis de définir la configuration la plus adaptée.


Ils parlents de nous!




Budget et Planning


Plusieurs étapes sont nécessaires à la finalisation du MLiner:



Finalisation de la CAO (conception assistée par ordinateur)


Approvisionnement en matière première (tôles d'aluminium, composants électroniques, pièces mécaniques, panneaux solaires, turbines)


Construction effective


Tests et optimisation (simulation numérique et tests en conditions réelles)


Si votre soutien est au rendez-vous, nous serons en mesure de mettre le MLiner à l'eau dans un peu plus de 3 ans:

Afin de concrétiser ce projet, nous avons besoin de 300 000€ en apports propres. Comme illustré par le graphique qui suit, 23% de la somme que nous récoltons sont dédiés à la campagne: c'est la raison pour laquelle nous avons fixé un objectif de 400 000€.






Notre objectif sur Indiegogo:
Pour GEPS, la campagne va être constituée de plusieurs paliers:


Nous en parlons dans la vidéo: cette campagne vient en complément d'autres fonds que nous allons récolter pour construire le prototype dont le coût réel est de 10 millions d'euros. 
Nous faisons appel au crowdfunding pour plusieurs raisons:



Garder notre indépendance financière et assurer une maitrise totale de notre technologie et de nos projets en limitant l'apport des fonds d'investissement;

Faire connaitre notre projet au grand public; 
Favoriser l'acceptabilité de notre projet, en commençant à informer dès la phase de lancement;
Diversifier notre capital et mettre en place un effet de levier selon 3 paliers de campagne (200 000€, 300 000€, 400 000€)

Hybrid Bench / Le banc hybride pour annexe





Rangé dans un sac avec l’annexe, ce banc
peut être installé facilement sur tout type d’annexe pour voilier. Au mouillage
ou pendant plusieurs journées de navigation, le banc vous permet d’exploiter
votre annexe pour fournir de l’électricité verte ! Le banc est en effet
équipé d’un système de relevage mécanique simple, et des turbines rangées sous
ce dernier peuvent être déployées en l’air (éoliennes) ou dans l’eau
(hydroliennes) et venir recharger une batterie. La batterie, quant à elle, peut
servir soit à alimenter le moteur de l’annexe dans le cas d’une propulsion
électrique, soit à fournir de l’énergie de bord au voilier.
GEPS a également prévu d’exploiter
l’énergie solaire : lorsque le banc est relevé, une toile solaire peut
être fixée sur les montants du banc de chaque côté de l’annexe, et étendue
jusqu’à l’avant du bateau. Un système de lattes similaires à celles présentes
dans une voile classique permet de maintenir la forme de la toile solaire en
cas de vent.
DESIGN: Arthur METGE



Hybrid Bench Package / Le pack banc hybride pour annexe



Le pack hybride comprend notre banc hybride pour annexe, une annexe de 2,40m, et un moteur électrique Torqeedo Travel 503!


L'Eco-Tender









L’Eco-Tender est une annexe pour yacht respectueuse de
l’environnement. Conçu pour des balades silencieuses dans des environnements
naturels souvent sensibles, l’éco-tender fonctionne exclusivement à l’énergie
électrique. Cette énergie est générée par un système de production hybride, qui
exploite le vent et le soleil. 
L’Eco-Tender est équipé d'un salon permettant de partager des moments de convivialité dans des cadres exceptionnels et dans des conditions optimales . Son toit et ses éoliennes peuvent être rétractés à l’arrêt afin de faciliter le stockage de
l’annexe sur votre navire principal.

 Damien CASTERA 




""Après de nombreuses années de compétitions internationales de surf, qui amènent malheureusement le sportif à s'éloigner de
la relation première qu'il entretient avec la nature, j'ai décidé de mettre un
terme à mes ambitions sportives et d'orienter ma carrière vers le voyage
d'aventure et d'exploration. Depuis plus d'un an, je travaille avec Mathieu
Crepel, champion du monde de snowboard, sur un projet de documentaire mettant
en relief le cycle de l'eau et l'interdépendance des environnements. Actuellement (8 juin) nous sommes en Alaska, afin de réaliser une odyssée
sportive sur la piste de l'eau, des montagnes à l'océan, du flocon à la vague. 


Dans cette dynamique de compréhension de l'eau sous toutes ses formes, j'ai
découvert avec enthousiasme les projets de GEPS, et notamment cette
capacité à transformer l'énergie cinétique de la houle en une énergie
utilisable par l'homme. L'originalité de réunir sur une même plateforme les
différents secteurs d'énergies marines renouvelables me semblent une excellente
idée et c'est avec une joie profonde que je rejoins l'aventure du MLiner. Cette
alternative aux énergies fossiles est une réelle opportunité de construire un
futur de manière responsable, en harmonie avec les grandes forces de la nature.""



  Laurette
""On nous parle déjà du changement climatique à l'école. Mes copains et moi on sait que les énergies renouvelables, c'est l'avenir. Le MLiner en réunit 4, ça nous fait 4 fois plus de raisons de le soutenir. Et en plus, il est beau ce bateau!""
----------------------------------------------------------
FAQ
La réponse à la question que vous vous posez est sûrement ici! 

Qu'est ce qui garantit la réalisation du projet MLiner?
Nos partenaires et nos investisseurs nous ont déjà accordé leur confiance, ce qui nous a permis de développer, construire et vendre notre première bouée houlomotrice brevetée en seulement 4 ans.
Les pôles de compétitivité EMC2, et Pôle Mer Bretagne Atlantique ont également valorisé nos réalisations. Enfin, en 2013 et 2014, GEPS a été le lauréat de 3 concours d'innovation: les Audacity Awards, Crisalides Eco-Activités, et Cleantech Open France, et a reçu un prix KIC Climate.
 Jean-Luc Longeroche et Philippe Magaldi ont l'expérience de l'industrie maritime et des chantiers navals, et le projet MLiner se peaufine un peu plus de jour en jour.

GEPS, c'est déjà une entreprise. Pourquoi avez-vous besoin de l'argent de particuliers? Pourquoi soutenir ce projet?

Les différents concours que nous avons remportés, la
reconnaissance des médias et les partenariats nous ont apporté de la visibilité
et de la crédibilité, mais pas de fonds propres. Ces fonds propres privés
(capital principalement) nous sont nécessaires pour que les financeurs publics
qui peuvent accompagner notre développement (Etat français, Europe, DOE USA)
acceptent de nous subventionner ou de nous prêter des fonds.
Les fonds propres privés peuvent provenir de fonds
d’investissements ou d’industriels : ces actionnaires ont leur propre
stratégie qui peut nous faire dévier de notre cible initiale. En récoltant des
fonds de manière participative, nous conservons notre indépendance et pouvons
décider nous-même des choix technologiques et stratégiques qui nous paraissent
les plus justes. 

C’est la raison pour
laquelle nous faisons appel au crowdfunding. Notre projet est innovant et
insolite, et nous avons d'ores et déjà les clés organisationnelles et
technologiques permettant sa réalisation: avec votre aide, nous pourrons
arriver au bout.


GEPS Techno, GEPS Innov, GEPS... Pourquoi avez-vous plusieurs dénominations?

GEPS Innov regroupe les activités associées au MLiner lui-même: c'est la holding de GEPS pour laquelle nous réalisons le crowdfunding aujourd'hui. GEPS Techno est la filiale de GEPS Innov, qui a développé les produits aujourd'hui commercialisés: OCTOPUSEA (houlomoteur), SIRE (stabilitateur de navire) et GSIRE (stabilisateur de navire avec récupération d'énergie).
Le groupe GEPS désigne donc ces deux entités.

Quels sont les délais de livraison pour les contreparties?
Comptez une dizaine de jours entre le moment où vous réalisez votre don et le moment où vous recevrez votre contrepartie.
Pour les préventes, à savoir banc hybride, l'éco-tender et le MLiner, nous vous contacterons directement afin d'affiner votre commande (particulièrement dans le cas de l'éco-tender et du MLiner) et de vous communiquer une date effective de livraison. A titre indicatif, nous estimons pouvoir vous livrer le banc hybride en Juin 2016, l'Eco-Tender en juin 2017, et le MLiner au deuxième semestre 2018.

Snapshot of the project

Geps Techno
is working on a prototype that is the first of its kind in the renewable energy
world. Putting together wind, sun, current and wave energy, it is built to
adapt to the changes of the 21st century with climate change
becoming such a real concern. There are still places without electricity in
this world, and this current project could help supply energy to places that
are small enough. But this is only the beginning, with this prototype funded,
we will be able to build a larger MLiner that will power larger places! This
project can help substitute the unclean power sources and can power most
unreachable places, that never thought they could have electricity before. So join us, as we help
innovate the future of renewable energy!
Also, if you feel concerned about the climate change and energy transition, join in our project and help us achieve this hybrid innovation. To do this, simply press the ""CONTRIBUTE NOW"" button. (It will say that you need a paypal account, we assure you that you do not, look under the ""Updates"" section to see how to get past this).
You will be able to donate starting at €1, this will let you participate in the development of clean energy technology and you will receive recognition in a collage image of the MLiner!

Diving Deeper



GEPS & the MLiner



History and description 


The MLiner is a floating platform that produces electricity from four renewable energy sources: sun, wind, waves and stream. This concept was born in 2011 and is at the origins of GEPS Group's creation in 2011. 




The aim of this project is to feed autonomous systems at sea: islands, isolated areas... Places still very dependent on fossil fuels. 
The design of the MLiner itself allows to reduce energy generation intermittence, thanks to the combination (or the so-called ""hybridization"") of 4 energy sources.

Each subsystem has been optimized by GEPS to perfectly fit in the MLiner's structure: the solar panels, wind and stream turbines have been chosen among existing technologies, and a series of successive tests allowed us to define the best configuration for these devices. 


They talk about us!



Budget & Planning 


Several steps need to be followed in order to complete the realization of the MLiner:



CAD (computer-aided design)


Base material supply (aluminium sheet, electronic component, mechanical items, solar panels, turbines)


Building


Tests and optimization (numerical simulation and real condition testings)


To make our project come true, we need a 300 000€ net inflow. As illustrated on the following graph, 23% of the total that we will get are dedicated to the campaign itself, which is why we set a 400 000€ goal.






Our aim on Indiegogo
The campaign will be divided into several landings:


As mentioned in the video, the campaign will add on other funds that we are gathering to reach our financial goal: the total cost for the building of the MLiner is 10 Million euros. 
We make use of a crowdfunding campaign for several reasons:


To keep our financial independence as well as a complete control of our   technology and projects by limiting investment funds inflows.
Broadcast to the general public the implication of our company in the fight against climate change, and encourage the development of participatory funding, which allows to concretize projects that meet the citizens' expectations.

Diversify our equity and have a lever effect, which guarantees our project's success. The following figure illustrates this effect with the three financial schemes that could be achieved to respectfully build a 1MW, a 500kW, and a 300kW MLiner.




With your support, we can launch the MLiner within 3 years:

Damien CASTERA 



 ""After numerous years of international surf contests, which unfortunately drive the athletes to grow apart from nature, I decided to end my sports ambitions and to aim towards travelling and exploration.                                                                    I've been working for more than a year with Mathieu Crepel, snowboard world champion, on a documentary project that highlights the water cycle and environments' interdependence.    We are currently (8th of June) in Alaska, performing a sport odyssey, tracking water from mountains to the ocean, from the snowflake to the wave.
In this dynamic understanding of water in its different forms, I discovered GEPS with enthusiasm, and especially the ability to transform waves kinetic energy into an energy that can be used by mankind. The originality of gathering four different energies on a single platform, the different marine renewable energy sectors seems to me like a brilliant idea, and it is with deep joy that I join the MLiner's adventure. This alternative to fossil fuels is a real opportunity to build a responsible future , in harmony with nature's great forces.""






Laurette


""We've already been taught at school that climate change is harming the planet. My friends and I know that renewable energies are our future. The MLiner has four of them, so that's four times more reasons to support the project. And, this ship is beautiful!""

--------------------------------------------------------------
FAQ
The answer to your question is probably here! 
What guarantees me that the MLiner project will succeed?
Our partners and investors already places their trust in us, which allowed us to develop, build and sell our first patented wave energy converter in only four years. 
 EMC2 & Pôle Mer Bretagne Atlantique clusters also promoted our projects. 
Finally, in 2013 & 2014, GEPS won three French innovation contests: Audacity Awards, Crisalides Eco-Activités, &  Cleantech Open France. GEPS was also awarded by KIC-Climate after the Cleantech Open France.
 Jean-Luc Longeroche & Philippe Magaldi have the experience of maritime industry and on the shipyards, and the MLiner project is being furthered day after day.

GEPS is already a company on the go. Why would you need money from the general public? Why support your project?

The different contests that we won, the recognition from the medias, and our partnerships brought us an increased coverage, but no equity. Those private funds (mainly equity) are necessary for the public financers (France, Europe, DOE USA) to support us and lend us the funds that we need. 
Private funds can come from investment funds or industries: these shareholders have their own strategy, and it could affect GEPS and its initial goal. By gathering funds in a more participative way, we can keep our independence and make our own technological and organizational choices.
This is the reason why we are doing a crowdfunding campaign. The MLiner is unique and innovative, and we already have the organizational and technological keys that allow its achievement. With your help, we'll reach the finish line.

GEPS Techno, GEPS Innov, GEPS... Why several names?
GEPS Innov gathers the activities associated with the MLiner itself: it is the holding for which we do the crowdfunding campaign today. GEPS Techno is GEPS Innov's affiliate, which developed the products marketed today: OCTOPUSEA (wave energy converter), SIRE (ship stabilization system) and GSIRE (ship stabilization system with energy harvesting system).
GEPS group refers to 2 entities.

What are the delays for the delivery of the perks?
We intend to deliver your perks within 15 working days from the moment you order your perk.  
For the hybrid bench, the Eco-Tender and the MLiner, we will directly get in touch with you in order to refine your order (especially for the Eco-Tender and the MLiner), and to give you an approximate schedule for the delivery of the product.

</p><p> </p>
<p> </p><p><br/></p>My name is Sargent Gallardo; I am an E-5 Scout Reconnaissance for the US Army, Nov 24, 2004 to Nov 28, 2008. I Served in Operations Iraqi Freedom. While on active duty in Iraq my Humvee ran over a roadside IED (improvised explosive device). I was considered dead but came back after 10 minutes of no heartbeat. My injuries included shrapnel throughout my body and my eyes and severely damaged left leg, a severely damaged right hand and TBI (traumatic brain injury). The doctors worked to save my left leg but my body kept rejecting the surgeries. They managed to save my hand though and I was blinded for three months from the shrapnel. Since my body kept rejecting all help, the doctors decided that amputation was my best bet to save my life since my leg became infected and the infection moved to my entire body. My body adjusted quickly to the amputation and the physical therapy went well. A year and a half after my injury I met my fiancé and we now have three young boys. I am currently a manager and head coach for a crossfit gym. I do not let me disability disable me from what I know I am capable of. Recently all of my activities have been catching up to me and take a toll on my body. A few months ago I had a screw removed from my limb that was starting to pierce through my skin and causing infection. I am also going to a physical therapist twice a month that helps realign my body. I have many problems with my left shoulder and hip from having to compensate for my left side that has the prosthetic. My family and I live in a two-story home with the master bed upstairs. When I come home I take my prosthetic leg off because it is so swollen and raw from the days activities. Most days going up stairs are extremely hard. The everyday activities like, taking a shower, playing with my kids and house chores is not an easy thing. I have to jump over the lip of my tube to get in and out, dry and wet. I have slipped many times getting in and out of the shower. I move around my house with crutches and I have my children and wife get what I need. I am constantly at the VA for doctor’s appointments to figure out better solutions for my pain. My family and I even started looking for a one-story home with a back patio cover at the beginning of 2014 because I just could not stand going up and down the stairs to my room any more and the sun hurts my eyes from the surgeries I had to remove the shrapnel, I cant be outside in the sun for long periods of times, so playing with my kids outside or even sitting down to watch them is most times tough. When I was presented with this opportunity to have a master bed and bath built down stairs to my disability I was in shock. Nothing like this has every came to me and I am truly humbled. My family and I have made this house a home and hated the thought of moving. My kids have friends here and we have made friends with many people as well. This neighborhood is a great neighborhood. If we get this opportunity for a master bed and bath downstairs, I do not see us going anywhere.

<p>The

<p><b>Bowerman Sports Science Clinic: Pressure mapping analysis</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>Comments and Observations</b></p>
<p>From our analysis of the pressure mapping data, we can make the following
observations:</p>
<ul><li>- When the novel insole device was used, <b>the peak metatarsal force was
reduced by 23% on the Left, and 18% on the Right, in comparison with the
control shoe</b>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>- With use of the novel insole device, the timing of peak metatarsal force
was observed to be slightly later in the stance phase of gait. In the control
shoe, the timing of peak metatarsal force was 80% and 79% of stance for the
Left and Right foot, respectively. With the novel insole device, timing of peak
metatarsal force was 83% and 81% of stance for the Left and Right foot,
respectively.</li></ul>
<p>Reduction of peak metatarsal force indicates that <b>pressure under the
metatarsal heads was redistributed effectively</b>. This can be confirmed from
examination of the 2D pressure map of the Insole Condition, where it is
apparent that pressure has been distributed more posteriorly over a larger area
of the midfoot, and subsequently reduced over the metatarsal heads.</p>

of life. At that time there were many injured recovering from the effects of
two world wars which created a high demand for Prosthetics and Orthotics.
Rainer worked for various companies and organizations fabricating Orthotics during the course of his
career. One of the most rewarding and satisfying was seeing children able to walk again at the Shriners
Hospital in Chicago.  Rainer expanded his professional skills while working at a
rehabilitation center in Wyoming with a wide variety of disabilities, including
Quadriplegic and amputees. While employed there he perfected an Orthotic that
winds around the lower leg, a modification of a design invented at the
University of New York. The new design was very modern, received many 
awards and was a great benefit to patients that were drawn from far locations
for treatment with the new design at the center. Rainer moved to California to work at an
innovative 'think tank' research center. While there he created a socket for prosthetics made
out of a clear glass like material which was unheard of at the time. The clear prosthetic socket permitted vision into the socket
which had never been accomplished before so it was possible to adjust the fit
and increase comfort for patients significantly.

 Rainer
was determined to provide the most up to date and innovative patient care as
possible which drove him to open his own business in Oregon in late 1970. While
self employee and running his own business Rainer did his first work with
myoelectric arms which were rather new at that time. He also designed custom fitted innovative orthotics
made of springy graphite fibers that returned energy back to the patient and
greatly reduced fatigue while increasing stability and motion. Rainer continued
to run his business and provide the latest innovations and custom designs until he retired in 2008. Now on a limited and
fixed income Rainer is crowd funding to bring his exceptionally
designed shoe to market to benefit people with diabetes.

<p>It is difficult to approach large shoe manufacturer's with a

</div></div>","Over a year
of design and testing of eighteen prototypes led to the development of the
DynaRebound shoe. Independently tested at Bowerman Sports Science Clinic on the
University of Oregon campus this dynamically designed sole increases
stabilization and returns energy to the user while redistributing pressure
points to increase comfort for diabetics. Engineered by Rainer Schmid whose life long career
in Prosthetics and Orthotics design provided the training
and skills to develop a shoe sole that would medically improve comfort and
energy for diabetics and other compromised people. Now retired with a fixed income Rainer is crowd
funding so that this new dynamic shoe 
can be brought to manufacture and made available to the public. The testimonial video of Kay, one of the diabetic volunteers that tested the shoe
sole at the University of Oregon campus gives her impressions of the new design above.

<p>My name is Danielle Vincent and I founded the Community Outreach Organization called Shoes &amp; Sandwiches (later S&amp;S) in 2011 with the drive to assist the local population that struggles with homelessness and meeting basic life needs. I currently attend school at Sacramento State University studying Philosophy of Ethics, Politics &amp; Law and hold an A.A. in Administration of Justice and an A.S. in Corrections. I also provide low cost and free graphic and web design to local entrepreneurs who are seeking to grow their business, but do not have capital to invest in high cost branding. A foundation of S&amp;S and my personal mantra is that a lot of help can be given by utilizing creative funding options and by helping each other be the best that we can be. With that, Firefly was born in 2012-- an aesthetically pleasing clothing shop where the community can shop in  a boutique setting while fostering community support. </p>

<p></p>Firefly has been open for 3 years at the 19th block of P Street in Midtown Sacramento. Over the three years, we've seen a lot of change happen on our block-- most for the good and some that has hindered Firefly and stunted it's development. In January of 2014 construction began on the building next door to us. For months there was heavy, loud construction against the wall we shared with the building business. Because of the incredibly loud noises in our space during business hours and the tenting, our customers assumed that we had closed. Immediately after construction began, we saw a 75% decrease in business and have been working to rebuild since. For the following months after construction ended, we embraced the new client base and welcomed our new neighbors. As our client base changed, we needed to change with it and also find a way to recover from the devastating losses we encountered early 2014. In October 2014, the Midtown Collective was conceived. We partitioned the 2,000sf space into several boutique spaces and rented spaces to local entrepreneurs. By sharing the operational costs, we were able to convert Firefly from recycled clothing to new clothing and increase the price point. Through  early 2015 several businesses came into the collective and because of the incredible sacrifice that accompanies a start-up business, left the space and closed. The instability of the environment combined with a severely declined amount of foot traffic demonstrated that the collective space was not preferable for the location. In May 2015 Firefly expanded to fill 2/3 of the space and currently shares the final 1/3 with a substantiated business with several years of staked success online: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SofiaVeranoClothing?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sofia Verano Custom Clothing.   </a>Together, we have created a unique space that is home to new, recycled and handmade fashion. <br/><p></p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>With increased staffing at neighboring business, parking has become limited if available within the immediate block around the building.<br/>

<li>Foot traffic is limited in our current location as we are located 7 blocks from the main shopping district in Midtown Sacramento.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our location was chosen originally after careful consideration and we found great success in our first two years, showing an increase in traffic, revenue and support monthly. After construction and significant changes to our block, we found ourselves fighting an uphill battle to regain the momentum that we had built and came to find ourselves out of place amidst the new surrounding businesses. <br/></p>
<p>By relocating to the Arden Fair Mall, we will find ourselves in an environment with guaranteed foot traffic, high profile advertisement and like businesses that share our style, business model, and goals. <br/></p>

<h3>What Firefly Needs:</h3> <p>Firefly needs a few things to effectively grow. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Relocation to a high traffic area with guaranteed foot traffic and with a steady stream of deliberate shoppers. <br/>
</li>
<li>Upgrades and Build-Out to match the new environment.</li>
<li>Additional merchandise to fill the new space. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Midtown Sacramento is beautiful, but our location is many blocks away from the shopping district and parking is very, very limited near our building. There is a strong correlation between the type of customer entering the building and sales. We currently have a majority of ""happenstance"" shoppers who enter the store because they are walking by and are visually interested in the space, but they do not have the ""shopping mental state"" accompanying their visit. We need a majority of our customers to be ""destination"" shoppers -- those who come in with the intent to shop and buy. It's all about the state of mind of the shopper. With our excellent customer service, pleasing product, and aesthetic environment, we are able to convert the happenstance shopper on occasion, but it is still very difficult to create a reliable stream of destination shoppers in our current location.  <br/></p>
<p>The funds raised from our campaign will aid in our relocation into the Arden Fair Mall. A flourishing, high fashion, indoor mall that draws approximately 25,000 shoppers per day-- most with ""shopping mental states.""</p>

Together, we have identified a space, determined the square footage necessary and discussed the malls investment in building a partition wall to create the preferred size space for both Firefly and the Mall. Arden Fair Mall will bear the burden of the partition build-out as an an investment in our success. <br/><br/>We've identified the costs of relocation and build-out:<br/><ul>
<li>$10,300 for move in costs.</li>
<li>$5,000-$8,000 for build out.</li>
<li>$5,000 for merchandise purchase</li>
<li>$5,000 reserved for lease expenses following opening.</li>
<li>$5,000 toward payroll and new-hire expenses as we will need to increase staffing. <br/>

</ul>
<p>Firefly currently and has always generated enough revenue to cover all operation costs and we feel confident that it will continue to do so in the new space immediately. <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will allow Firefly to grow to be able to support the philanthropic goals of S&amp;S. It has been a long running goal to open a boutique, voucher based clothing closet for the community that provides clothing to those in need by creating an atmosphere that mirrors a retail experience so that those requiring the service can shop in a dignified way that offers a sense of shopping ""normalcy"" to those who otherwise are not able to purchase clothing in a typical storefront. This clothing closet will also work as a home-base for S&amp;S where donations can be taken in and sorted and office work and logistical planning and meetings can take place. </p>
<p>Your contribution will also allow Firefly to employ locally sourced team-members with full time hours and a desirable hourly wage with upward mobility and valuable work-force training. <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Business is a challenge and there is a lot of risk involved. The only way that I have been able to grow and build Firefly is because I'm willing to take risks-- carefully planned, strategic risks that are not frivolous or without carefully planning, research and forethought. The main challenge is ensuring that I have enough to move and to build the space out in order to open in our new mall location without missing a beat-- without looking out of place in a heavily funded environment. But, I promise that I can do it and that if you invest in me, I will deliver and I will deliver beyond your expectations.  <br/> </p>

Every Child has a Right to Dream

We believe a right to shelter, food and school is not enough. Education without opportunity is not enough. Life without dreams is not living, it's surviving - and all children should a right to life. Anything less is not enough.
Who are we?

We are a small but deeply motivated team  based in Tacloban and Manila - Philippines. We've been brought together by a Londoner (Marko), who was born to Croatian Mother and Serbian Father, in a country that no longer exists. (go figure).
But we all believe that extreme inequality is an epidemic and our leaders are not doing anything to fix it! We know the game is fixed and we're not trying to change the rules. We're trying to change the mindset of the new generation. Sounds tough? It is but it's fun and super rewarding! 
We set up FundLife just this year and we're very excited at creating a new kind of NGO - one that does not rely on poverty porn and one that doesn't just give hand-outs. Our model is to foster self-worth through self-courage. To inspire every child to dream big and dare them to be their best self!


What are we doing? 

i) Attempting to send 30 Haiyan Survivor-players and 50 other young football players from
marginalised communities on a life-changing journey to take part in this year's
Sama-Sama Games on the
world’s best island – yep, it’s true! Sama-Sama Games 2014_SV from Sama-Sama on Vimeo.#
ii) Let youth and sport restore human solidarity, where political leaders have made the world more divided than it's ever been!




Why are we doing it?

We could probably list 100 reasons; here are just three;


We believe self-worth isn't determined by net-worth
We believe all human life has equal value
We give opportunity, not charity


But Why this?

When
Typhoon Haiyan came to Tacloban, it left the city almost bare not only of
infrastructures but also of dreams. The world gave and building slowly rose. But the invisible barriers exist. The Typhoon took away children's ability to look forward because they could only look back at what they lost.This project provides hope and

Philippines to pursue their own cherished goals in life, and not just those on
the football pitch despite the social injustice and natural calamities. It
allows us to change the current victim belief in the Philippines by giving
young people the power to change norms and positively influence thousands of
children per community represented.

By letting these young people experience what life has to offer, we raise their self-worth, empowering them through dignity and giving them courage and confidence to dare to dream. We lift them out of the mental inertia of poverty and hopelessness.

REMOVING IMPOSSIBLE 


REMOVING PREJUDICES  REMOVING CHARITY


THE PERKS....
We would like this to be far more than just a campaign - we'd like it to be a movement, however small. So, feast your eyes on what standing up for dreams and vulnerable children gets you!

<br/>
<p>Sophies originally sprang from a desire to build something great for my family, and nothing spoke to that more than those memories of my grandmother rolling pierogi at the kitchen counter in Jersey.  </p>
<p>The love of my life, Angie, and I with some help from our kids,  launched Sophie's Gourmet Pierogi in 2012 to fantastic criticism and huge accolades.  We grabbed the award for National Rookie Food Truck right out of the gate, were featured on the Food Truck Friday feature on Fox 28/ABC 4 and had one of the top 5 dishes to try our freshman run at The Columbus Food Truck Festival.  We had a brisk season, but as we pulled into a very slow, cold and snowy winter we looked at our life and responsibilities and a job in a corporate setting became a temporary necessity.  It was heartbreaking for us and from what we hear, for a lot of you as well.</p>
<p>BUT…  we're back on the road having brought Sophie's back as a cart and the demand is pushing us to grow! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>Our big push here is to help us fully outfit our new production kitchen.  We've found a lovely space that meets our needs and gives us room to grow, but there are some improvements we need to make to get the space up to code and production, storage and refrigeration equipment we need to keep up with our growing demand.  </li>
<li>The location we've chosen also gives us much better proximity to RELAUNCH SOPHIE'S AS A FOOD TRUCK!  You heard it right.  A full sized truck will give us a much greater capacity for special events, weddings, festivals and even our every day operations giving us a chance to provide delicious dumplings in any setting.</li> <li>I've spent a lot of time thinking up fun and innovative ways to say thank you to all of you who choose to support us in this growth.  Sure we'll have bottle openers and t-shirts, but how about free pierogi for a year!  Check out our perks cause, yeah, it's in there.</li>
<li>So, of course, there's a chance we fall short of our fundraising goals.  The production facility is a go regardless of the outcome of this campaign and the balance of the funds that we do collect will be used to increase our mobile output with a refrigerated cargo van so that we can put up the big numbers at events and festivals around central Ohio. <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently, pierogi production takes place 45 minutes outside of Columbus which drains resources and time we need to grow.  A successful campaign makes supplying our wholesale customers much easier, which in turn makes providing your pierogi fix a snap.<br/>
</li>
<li>Sophie's is about family.  We're providing a taste of our delicious family history in this unique product.  It's not that you can't go get a bag of those other pierogi from the freezer case, but we all know that it's not grandma approved.  This hand made product is free of additives and stabilizers.  It's real good food from real people and we want to make it as widely available as possible.</li> <li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It's a real and distinct honor to introduce </span>you to something so personal and important to me.  There's nothing else I'd rather do and I want every Sophie's experience to make my Grandma Sophie proud.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risk's and Challenges</h3> <ul> <li>Stepping away from the business and coming back at a different scale has given us a lot of knowledge and confidence in our business model.  Nothing in business, especially food, is a ""slam dunk"", but we hear and see the impact we make on our customers daily.  While we aren't the only pierogi game in town, we made an early mark on the market and have a product that is easily integrated into other restaurant concepts that blends seamlessly into the food culture of Columbus.</li> <li>We're 100% committed to our return to Sophie's having tucked so many valuable lessons under our belt.</li> </ul>
<div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div> </div> <div> <ul>
<li>We know that we're coming out of the holidays and not everyone has the resources to financially support us, but you can still help us.  Tell your friends, get the word out!  Tell people how excited you are to see Sophie's back on the road in a big way!  </li> <li>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary We are Sophie's Gourmet Pierogi.

Sophie's is about family.  We're providing a taste of our delicious family history in this unique product.  It's not that you can't go get a bag of those other pierogi from the freezer case, but we all know that it's not grandma approved.  This hand made product is free of additives and stabilizers.  It's real good food from real people and we want to make it as widely available as possible. 
It's a real and distinct honor to introduce you to something so personal and important to me.  There's nothing else I'd rather do and I want every Sophie's experience to make my Grandma Sophie proud.


Risk's and Challenges  Stepping away from the business and coming back at a different scale has given us a lot of knowledge and confidence in our business model.  Nothing in business, especially food, is a ""slam dunk"", but we hear and see the impact we make on our customers daily.  While we aren't the only pierogi game in town, we made an early mark on the market and have a product that is easily integrated into other restaurant concepts that blends seamlessly into the food culture of Columbus. We're 100% committed to our return to Sophie's having tucked so many valuable lessons under our belt. 
Other Ways You Can Help   
We know that we're coming out of the holidays and not everyone has the resources to financially support us, but you can still help us.  Tell your friends, get the word out!  Tell people how excited you are to see Sophie's back on the road in a big way!   Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Digital Evidence requirements change rapidly, as quickly as technology develops. Many agencies face challenges in developing solutions to the problems posed by new technologies. DEVCE's role is to solve those problems.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>DEVCE (the Digital Evidence Virtual Centre of Excellence) will provide a single point of contact to bring together investigators and technologists to solve problems quickly and efficiently, ensuring that results are available to the community. It won't be just an online forum, but will provide a managed service to ensure that solutions, if they can be found, are produced to meet the needs of the members.</p>
<p>Unlike other centres, DEVCE will not be tied to one, or just a few, institutions. Instead, it will draw talent from wherever it happens to be, putting together the best teams that it can find to solve real-world problems as quickly as possible. This means that it won't be trying to sell the services of any particular group, company or establishment, but will focus on helping the whole community to come together to provide real solutions and share knowledge. And, of course, if the talented move on, they'll still be part of the centre, because DEVCE will be wherever they are.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>DEVCE will START as a UK-based community interest company and aims to become self-sufficient to allow its services to be offered free of charge world-wide. Initially, however, in order to develop sufficient resources to allow it to start to generate income, we will use a subscription-based model and crowdfunding to cover operating costs. Once the operating model has been proven, we will explore how the service can be extended to other countries</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>The Centre is going ahead, but needs your help to get it up and running. Since the idea was floated at the end of August 2014, we have had nothing but positive indications of support and now have a queue of problems waiting to be solved, and a pool of talent waiting to work on them. </p>
<p>We need some initial capital to allow us to form the company and cover the costs of the initial work. Without the cash we can't provide the backing and reward that the problem solvers need to justify their involvement.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE : As of 26th February 2015, DEVCE is formally the Digital Evidence Centre of Excellence C.I.C., a community interest company registered in England &amp; Wales with company registration number 9461258</b></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This Centre will solve some of the biggest problems faced by digital evidence users today. It will allow them to call on expertise, wherever it happens to be. It will ensure that new innovations are properly shared and also ensure that there is less duplication of effort and thus less wasted time and money. Most importantly, though, it will allow the problem solvers to engage in the sort of small but highly valuable project which is currently impossible to justify because funding models don't allow for it.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest challenge, and risk to success, is always going to be money.

<p>Thriving social media activity is important to the way many people make choices when it comes to brand loyalty and purchasing decisions.

<h2>How does Fbox work?</h2>
<p>The Fbox is connected to the Internet and a digital LED counter display updates in real time as each Facebook like is registered. This combination offers businesses an opportunity to build Facebook fans and deliver messages and/or advertising to the user when they access the Wi-Fi. It also encourages network users to interact in real time by placing their own Facebook like, updating the counter. A ‘like’ provides the business owner access to users’ previous Facebook activities and behavior, which can then be matched to highly-targeted advertising and other customized messages. This also attracts the user to the Facebook page where further branding and engagement can take place. The marketing value of an Fbox to a business is multifold in this respect.</p>

opportunities.

Because investors can help to <b>build the African continent</b> and Africa can pay the investors a good return for their trust. They want to show that Africa is a place for good and trustworthy investments. <b>Property crowdfunding</b> is a way to make this possible.</p>
<p><b>Your support will change the lives of many people in Africa.</b> You will help business owners in Africa to get new opportunities for attracting money and growing their business. By using property crowdfunding, entrepreneurs in Africa can build a future which is also profitable. This is important because these opportunities don’t exist yet for businesses that offer real estate development.<br/></p><p></p><p>Your support will also open up opportunities for
developing <b>Eco lodges</b> as well as
other Eco-friendly buildings which are environmental friendly and support
sustainable development.</p><p>And <b>you will also help yourself</b> because you get access to new investments with good returns.  <br/><br/></p><h3>Why is Realty Africa worthy of your support?</h3><h3></h3><h2></h2><p>Because we want to offer good investments with a good return and change the perception of investing in Africa, we started the property crowdfunding company Realty Africa.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><b><i>Realty Africa can offer access to good investments that

Property crowdfunding allows for a more dynamic approach to
property development, giving rise to more creativity which can span from <b>infrastructure, tourist hotels and resorts, Eco lodges, to housing complexes</b>. Good entrepreneurs can grow their business without putting a lot of money into collateral at the bank. A big deal!</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>How can you trust that there will be only good projects on the platform?</i> We entered into a service agreement with <b>Deloitte</b> to check all the projects and use their knowledge and experience they have in Africa.

Do you have a dream of increasing your wealth in a transparent and trustworthy way? And do you also at the same time want to make a real difference to the projects you invest in?
Probably
like many of you, we were also looking for these investment opportunities with good
profits and we were looking for investments that are socially responsible and would make a difference in the world.Where to find these investments without investing in a scam? Investments where you
don’t have to put large amounts of money in and where everybody can join? Investments that will change the perception of investing in Africa?  We couldn't find the right opportunities yet, however:

Imagine that you could invest in
interesting projects with a good return and with only a small amount of money? 
How
would you feel if you knew that the projects are safe and your money is protected? 

What would it sound like to you if this investment would really make a
difference to the urban and industrial areas of the local community, which you
are supporting?


In order to find the right opportunity you need access
to good investments that are:

Transparent



Secure

Properly vetted by a trustworthy company

Offering good returns to you the investor


Easy to access for you also if you have a limited
amount of time or money 


And finding good and accessible investments was never
more needed than now because global interest rates are at their lowest and your
savings are not offering you any return anymore.Why Africa is a good place to invests and how can you help?
Africa is a continent of many
opportunities. It has some of the fastest growing economies in the world and it has a very young population that wants to create a future.Many people in Africa do not need charity; they need investors to invest in this growth. Because investors can help to build the African continent and Africa can pay the investors a good return for their trust. They want to show that Africa is a place for good and trustworthy investments. Property crowdfunding is a way to make this possible.
Your support will change the lives of many people in Africa. You will help business owners in Africa to get new opportunities for attracting money and growing their business. By using property crowdfunding, entrepreneurs in Africa can build a future which is also profitable. This is important because these opportunities don’t exist yet for businesses that offer real estate development.Your support will also open up opportunities for
developing Eco lodges as well as
other Eco-friendly buildings which are environmental friendly and support
sustainable development.And you will also help yourself because you get access to new investments with good returns.  Why is Realty Africa worthy of your support?Because we want to offer good investments with a good return and change the perception of investing in Africa, we started the property crowdfunding company Realty Africa.Realty Africa can offer access to good investments that
are transparent and secure and these investments will support entrepreneurs to
grow their business and build their community.


Where can you find these investments? We build a platform which is almost ready where local people can show their projects and where you can
invest in them. Realty Africa will be the first property crowdfunding platform
dedicated to sub-Saharan Africa.

How will this platform benefit you? Because you get easy access to lucrative investment opportunities which are well vetted, transparent and secure.

How will this platform benefit the business owners in Africa? The platform will offer a new way for local people to attract investments. Property crowdfunding allows for a more dynamic approach to
property development, giving rise to more creativity which can span from infrastructure, tourist hotels and resorts, Eco lodges, to housing complexes. Good entrepreneurs can grow their business without putting a lot of money into collateral at the bank. A big deal!


How can you trust that there will be only good projects on the platform? We entered into a service agreement with Deloitte to check all the projects and use their knowledge and experience they have in Africa. Our agreement with Deloitte is the first of its kind in the crowdfunding world and this way we know which entrepreneurs are good.

How can you be sure that your investment is protected? We also made sure that the investment is safe. A well-known investment company in Africa Imara Fiduciary is helping us as a fiduciary agent service provider so that all the money is secure and that the investments offered on Realty Africa, are protected.
What else can you expect from Realty Africa in the future? We are also planning many projects for the less privileged as well which makes us a partner of the local community. This we can only achieve with your support.
And yet there is more interesting news for you!

Realty Africa provides
an opportunity for investors to get access to investments in interesting  properties and locations with good returns
which they would otherwise not have had access to.

Property development still has a tremendous amount of upward growth in the region which brings a bright future for investments.
Property crowdfunding brings
a new trend and a new way of seeking capital which you can be a part off.

</h3> <p></p>
<p><i>My name is Paul Nichols and I am a 46-year-old Canadian veteran.</i><br/></p>
<p>I realized the power of a
heartfelt story when I was in Vancouver and a woman in a shop saw the Regimental
crest on my jacket and told me her story. <br/></p>
<p>As we talked, she cried and hugged me, and the people in line behind me had tears in their eyes.  We all listened to her tell the story of living
through the siege of Sarajevo.  For two years, she and the people with her were near starvation
and dodged daily sniper fire. <i> It was Canadian troops who saved their lives
and eventually got her out.</i></p>
<p>I am proud to be a former
Calgary Highlander who served with 2nd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry during the UN mission in the former Yugoslavia in 1993. When our
first daughter was born, I left the military and my wife and I returned to our
small town of Quesnel, in central B.C. Together with our daughters, we run a farm and riding
center, and our farm is certified through both the British Columbia Therapeutic
Riding Association and the Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association.</p>
<p>When I left the Calgary
Highlanders, I left the brotherhood and my support network.  As a veteran
who has been under fire and struggled to make the transition to civilian
life, I know how lonely it can be making a home in a community that
doesn’t recognize a contemporary veteran. I stopped telling my stories and then
began to spend a lot of time inside my own head wondering if my service had
been worthwhile. <br/></p>
<p>My own journey included my dog, my horse and a lot of
time alone on the river with a fly rod. <i>Ultimately, it was the
Bosnian woman in the shop who took the time to share her story that
changed my life, and I am a different person today because of her.</i></p>
<p>Several  years ago, I
returned to the military as a Canadian Ranger and, under the
supervision of BC Coy 4 CRPG, I took on the creation of a basic horsemanship
course/exercise.  Dozens of Canadian Rangers and Regular Army have been
through this training, and we have developed some proficient, confident riders. <br/></p>
<p>One evening around the fire, we were discussing the day's ride and one of the
Patricia’s asked what our Post Traumatic Stress Disorder treatment program
looked like. This is when we realized that we were uniquely suited to make a
difference, and it was the beginning of an idea. </p>
<p>My wife and I have
assembled a crew, and we have stepped off, as of April 13, 2015, from Victoria, B.C., and we are
leading a horseback relay across Canada.  My wife leads an advance party
with trucks, trailers, several horses and a small crew, and she co-ordinates
with communities to find our veterans who will then be given a riding lesson. <br/></p>
<p>Once they are safely through her lesson, these veterans will be staged to take
their place to join the ride with me as we pass
through, or close to, their own communities.  <br/></p>
<p>As I travel across the
country on horseback accompanied by these other riders, our team will document their
stories, which will then be organized and shared with the people of Canada. 
<br/></p>
<p><b><i>Our objective is to make it across Canada in 211 days and include as many
veteran guest riders as we can. </i></b><br/></p>
<p>This ride is not about one veteran and his
family riding across the country for a cause. By the time our horses get us to
the Atlantic coast, we will have been joined by and have heard the stories of
over <b>700 Canadian Veterans.  </b><br/></p>
<p>As these stories are collected and reflected
on, we will create awareness and encourage discussion of the challenges
that our service men and women face as they transition back into the world of
civilians. <br/></p>
<p>The Canadian people love their troops and our communities will
support them, but often times they don't know who they are after they clear out of
the military.  By educating our communities and raising awareness to the
changing face of their veterans, we can give them the
opportunity to truly support their troops. <br/></p>
<p>We believe that this
timely help from the communities that they have served will lower the
incidence of PTSD and family breakup, and I personally know that timely
help can change a life. </p>

<p>Our horses: 

</p>
<p><b><u>Is
this bad for the horses? </u></b></p>
<p>No. Our horses are very well cared for. They are on a vet-approved diet
and are monitored daily for good health. We are way below limits set by Equine
Canada for daily distance to travel. We have 4 extra horses so that horses are
rotated for days off and extra rest days if required. We are traveling with 8
horses, and only 4 horses will be used for the main ride at a time. The horses
will have regular vet checks and farrier checks, and their well-being is a priority
in this ride. <br/></p>

</div><div> <p>There are many ways you can help.  We have attached documents that you can use to share the word and posters to help recruit veterans for the ride. Please share, talk and let veterans know that it doesn't mean weakness to admit you need help returning to civilian life.  <br/></p>

My name is Paul Nichols and I am a 46-year-old Canadian veteran.
I realized the power of a
heartfelt story when I was in Vancouver and a woman in a shop saw the Regimental
crest on my jacket and told me her story. 
As we talked, she cried and hugged me, and the people in line behind me had tears in their eyes.  We all listened to her tell the story of living
through the siege of Sarajevo.  For two years, she and the people with her were near starvation
and dodged daily sniper fire.  It was Canadian troops who saved their lives
and eventually got her out.
I am proud to be a former
Calgary Highlander who served with 2nd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry during the UN mission in the former Yugoslavia in 1993. When our
first daughter was born, I left the military and my wife and I returned to our
small town of Quesnel, in central B.C. Together with our daughters, we run a farm and riding
center, and our farm is certified through both the British Columbia Therapeutic
Riding Association and the Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association.
When I left the Calgary
Highlanders, I left the brotherhood and my support network.  As a veteran
who has been under fire and struggled to make the transition to civilian
life, I know how lonely it can be making a home in a community that
doesn’t recognize a contemporary veteran. I stopped telling my stories and then
began to spend a lot of time inside my own head wondering if my service had
been worthwhile. 
My own journey included my dog, my horse and a lot of
time alone on the river with a fly rod. Ultimately, it was the
Bosnian woman in the shop who took the time to share her story that
changed my life, and I am a different person today because of her.
Several  years ago, I
returned to the military as a Canadian Ranger and, under the
supervision of BC Coy 4 CRPG, I took on the creation of a basic horsemanship
course/exercise.  Dozens of Canadian Rangers and Regular Army have been
through this training, and we have developed some proficient, confident riders. 
One evening around the fire, we were discussing the day's ride and one of the
Patricia’s asked what our Post Traumatic Stress Disorder treatment program
looked like. This is when we realized that we were uniquely suited to make a
difference, and it was the beginning of an idea. 
My wife and I have
assembled a crew, and we have stepped off, as of April 13, 2015, from Victoria, B.C., and we are
leading a horseback relay across Canada.  My wife leads an advance party
with trucks, trailers, several horses and a small crew, and she co-ordinates
with communities to find our veterans who will then be given a riding lesson. 
Once they are safely through her lesson, these veterans will be staged to take
their place to join the ride with me as we pass
through, or close to, their own communities.  
As I travel across the
country on horseback accompanied by these other riders, our team will document their
stories, which will then be organized and shared with the people of Canada. 

Our objective is to make it across Canada in 211 days and include as many
veteran guest riders as we can. 
This ride is not about one veteran and his
family riding across the country for a cause. By the time our horses get us to
the Atlantic coast, we will have been joined by and have heard the stories of
over 700 Canadian Veterans.  
As these stories are collected and reflected
on, we will create awareness and encourage discussion of the challenges
that our service men and women face as they transition back into the world of
civilians. 
The Canadian people love their troops and our communities will
support them, but often times they don't know who they are after they clear out of
the military.  By educating our communities and raising awareness to the
changing face of their veterans, we can give them the
opportunity to truly support their troops. 
We believe that this
timely help from the communities that they have served will lower the
incidence of PTSD and family breakup, and I personally know that timely
help can change a life.
