<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Pawda™ is a small GPS device that attaches to your
pet's collar. It makes it easy to use your smartphone to find your pet when he
or she gets lost on a furry adventure. It is simple to use, and can make sure
your pets get home safely.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Never Put Up A Lost Pet Poster Again!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nobody wants to lose their pet. But you don't want
to keep them locked up inside forever. Animals need to be outdoors. The problem
is they sometimes stray far from home, and it can be nerve-wracking to not know
if your pet is OK. That's why we are creating Pawda™, so that you can know
where your pet is at all times – and get a notification if they wander off!</p>
<p>Once Pawda™ is attached to your pet's collar, it
syncs up with an app on your smartphone. Then, if your pet wanders outside of
your designated safety zone your phone not only notifies you, but it also tells
you exactly where they are. It is waterproof, so you can even locate your dog
if he or she has decided to go for a swim. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108074/files/20131002005033-Hero-2.png?1380700233"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pawda™ uses satellite services in Australia,
Europe, and North America to identify exactly where your pet is, anywhere in
the world. It then syncs up with the map device on your phone or tablet to help
you find them. You can even monitor their movements in real time. </p>
<p>We plan to start producing Pawda™ in Jan/Feb 2014.
We are allowing 500 advance orders to help fund the initial production of the
product. </p>
<p>That said, we are willing to accept any amount of
support as it will help us protect our furry friends!</p>
<p><b>Under The Hood</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pawda™ will be built with high quality components
that have been fully tested by our engineers. It uses a GRPS quad-band module,
which will be updated to a 3G module on future iterations. </p>
<p>The tracking device will be the smallest on the
market, so it can attach to the pet's collar without bother or discomfort. The
accelerator/gyroscope combo is designed to maximize battery life between
charging times. The design is focused on providing maximum reliability in a
minimum amount of space. </p>
<p><b>The App </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108096/files/20131002010115-apps.png?1380700875"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>
<p><b><span>Easy To Use</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have made the app very simple to use. It
is available as a free download from all the major app stores once people have purchased
the tracking device. After you have activated the Sim via the Pawda™ website or
the mobile app you simply attach the device to your pet's collar, open the app
and it will be working immediately. </p>
<p>We give you several different ways to interact with
the map so you can always find exactly where you pet is at a moment's notice.</p>
<p><b>Peace of Mind </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The best part of Pawda™ is that it is constantly
working in the background. Once you have set the virtual fence around your home
for your pet, you don't have to do anything else. It will automatically let you
know when your pet has strayed too far away. </p>
<p>It will also automatically alert you when the
battery is low, and lets you know how far your pet walks in a day so you can
see if he or she is getting enough exercise. You can also check in on your pet
and find out if they are resting or running around. It's like being able to
watch them all day, even if you are away. </p>
<p><b>How to Attach Pawda™</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>It could not be easier to attach the device: Your
pet’s color simply feeds through the two slots on the underside of your Pawda™.
You are then good to go! </p>

<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>The
Pawda™ Story</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Pawda™ story started back in October 2010 when
Sydney Businessman Ryan Murphy met with App Developers Ross Lambert and Elias
Poulos. Ryan wanted to share his concept to develop an app that would track
pets when they strayed from their home. </p>
<p>Ross and Elias were very impressed with the idea
and went about designing the app and looking at all the wonderful features that
the app could offer. When they asked Ryan if he had considered the actual GPS
device that attaches to the pet, he replied “there are a few of these on the
market just buy some one of these and design the app to run in conjunction with
the GPS unit.”</p>
<p>Many months followed as research and testing took
place of various GPS tracking units. The challenge was to find a unit which had
a substantial battery life, was lightweight, ‘cool’ in appearance and despite
its size and weight had sufficient power to transmit in most terrains and conditions..
</p>
<p>All the units we found and tested had a battery
life of six or seven hours, which was considered by the team to be
unacceptable. If you were to attach a fully charged unit on your pet before
leaving for work in the morning it would be flat by the time you got home, and
what good is that. The other challenge we had was that of the units we found all
of them could only track one pet. Today it is not uncommon amongst pet owners
to have two or more pets in the one household, and that this had not been taken
into account with the current models.</p>
<p>Aesthetically we couldn't find anything that was
pleasing and appropriate, so it was decided that it was necessary to design our
own GPS tracker that had all the features we considered were necessary to make Pawda™
into a household name and provide peace of mind to thousands or even millions
of pet owners across the world.</p>
<p>We then set about to design and then engineer this
GPS tracking unit which ticked all the boxes we had identified as
essential.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Pawda™ Prototypes:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The very first prototype was completed in September
2011 it was shaped like a watch and came with a docking station for charging as
you can see in the images below. </p>
<p><span><span></span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108129/files/20131002014008-OCt-2011-Prototypes.png?1380703208"" src="""" style=""width: 550.7035175879397px; height: 585px;""/></p>
<i></i></span></span><p></p>
<p>Although we were very proud of our first prototype (after all
it was the culmination of 12 months work) we were concerned about the aesthetics
of the design and whether or not the design was ‘cool’ enough. </p>
<p>We then embarked on some extensive market research and ran a
number of research sessions with a variety individuals, couples and families who
were representative of the future demographic of Pawda™ users.</p>
<p>The overwhelming results of our market research was that the
product was an exceptional idea and they all wanted one or more (which was music to
our ears of course) however, in response to whether or not Pawda™ was
aesthetically pleasing, was it trendy and cool the answer was a big no!</p>
<p>So armed with our Market research report and all the
suggestions made by the respondees, we set about to clear the slate and
totally redesign Pawda™.</p>
<p>In June 2012 we produced prototype number 2 - a whole new
look and feel for Pawda™.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<i>
</i><p>
</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108135/files/20131002014559-Jun-2012-Prototypes.png?1380703559"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span><p></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;"">
</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;"">Prototype
Version 2 included a plate that connected on the underside of the dog’s collar
and the Pawda™ was secured into place using the two clips on either side of the
unit. </p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108136/files/20131002014726-Petlink_Phrototype_plans.jpg?1380703646"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p style=""font-style: italic;""></p>
<p><i>The
black button on the top Pawda™ is a ‘walk’ button which disarms the Pawda™ when you take your pet for a walk. This is because the Pawda™ starts to send a
signal every three minutes once the virtual perimeter has been breached.</i></p>
<p><i>After
using our market research result to formulate the Pawda™ version 2 we decided
we needed to go back to these same respondents and see if they felt we had
delivered a wonderful new device which would deliver ‘peace of mind to pet
lovers all over the world’. Most importantly was the device cool and of course,
would they buy one?</i></p>
<p><i>Again
the results were overwhelming in that they loved Pawda™ and this time they
loved the look and feel as well! Finally we had created what the market was
asking for. </i></p>
<p><i>There
was however, some strong feedback regarding the clips and the bottom plate
which despite being very practical we decided to see if we could dispense with
these creating a simpler sleeker design.</i></p>
<p><span><i><b>Prototype Version 3 – May 2013</b></i></span></p>
<p><i>Since then we have been refining Pawda™ to make the
device as small as possible and at the same time maintaining its long battery
life and superior transmission capabilities. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108138/files/20131002014854-Petlink_Prototype_3.jpg?1380703734"" src="""" style=""width: 522.4528301886792px; height: 390px;""/></i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>The latest prototype is around 30% smaller and
lighter. It also uses more advanced mapping features and has a longer battery
life. We are still testing even smaller and lighter set-ups to see how
effectively they sync up with major GPS satellite systems.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><i>The final version (below) is stunning it is small and light whilst maintaining quality satellite contact and a serious battery life of up to seven days.. All data is sent as
secure packets, and we have optimised the app to work with all major smartphone
operating systems.</i></span></p>
<p><i><span></span></i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108141/files/20131002015257-explanatory-mk3.png?1380703977"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p>

<i><br/></i><p></p>
<p><b><i>Pawda™ Development</i></b></p>
<p><i>Developing Pawda™ was not just about the technical
specs. It was also about figuring out how it would be used in the real world.
This meant studying how cats and dogs interact when they are outside. Pawda™ would
not be useful if your cat could take it off and leave it in a tree! We also had
to make sure that the device would not be bothersome to your pets. During our
studies, we found that the most important elements were to:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Make the device secure so it would not come off during normal
     activity. </i></li>
<li><i>Have it be light enough so that the pet would not notice it and try
     to remove it themselves. </i></li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>We also realised that we had to find the right
price point for the market. Here is how we addressed these issues. </i></p>
<p><b><i>Secure Attachment </i></b></p>
<p><i>First we developed clips that would attach Pawda™
to their collar and not come off. We tested them in real-time environments and
adjusted the specs of the clips until they kept the device secure even during
the most active pet play. </i></p>
<p><i>Then in the second prototype we moved away from the
clips as we were improving the overall design, shape, weight and dimensions. In
our latest design the collar simply threads through two slots on the underside
of the device. </i></p>
<p><b><i>Weight</i></b></p>
<p><i>The heaviest part of any device of this type is the
battery, which is why we designed all of our components to use the least amount
of energy possible. This means that the device eventually became light enough
so that the pets do not notice it is on their collar at all. Much of this was
accomplished by finding components that could be bundled as modules. </i></p>
<p><i>Pawda™ weighs just 48 grams, which for even the
smallest dogs is virtually unnoticeable on their collar. </i></p>
<p><b><i>Price</i></b></p>
<p><i>Finding the right price point was the most challenging part
of this process. We did surveys of potential customers and believe we have
found the right price point, however are willing to hear feedback from the Indiegogo
community.</i></p>
<p><i>Pawda™ will have a recommended retail price of $198 AUS.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Product Plan</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b></b></i></p>
<p><b><i>The final prototype is now complete and so to are the Apple
and Android apps. We are almost ready to launch the website and our back-end
web-server (this is like the engine room of the Pawda™.</i></b></p>

the tracking device. After you have activated the Sim via the Pawda™ website or
the mobile app you simply attach the device to your pet's collar, open the app
and it will be working immediately. 
We give you several different ways to interact with
the map so you can always find exactly where you pet is at a moment's notice.
Peace of Mind 

The best part of Pawda™ is that it is constantly
working in the background. Once you have set the virtual fence around your home
for your pet, you don't have to do anything else. It will automatically let you
know when your pet has strayed too far away. 
It will also automatically alert you when the
battery is low, and lets you know how far your pet walks in a day so you can
see if he or she is getting enough exercise. You can also check in on your pet
and find out if they are resting or running around. It's like being able to
watch them all day, even if you are away. 
How to Attach Pawda™

It could not be easier to attach the device: Your
pet’s color simply feeds through the two slots on the underside of your Pawda™.
You are then good to go! 





The
Pawda™ Story

The Pawda™ story started back in October 2010 when
Sydney Businessman Ryan Murphy met with App Developers Ross Lambert and Elias
Poulos. Ryan wanted to share his concept to develop an app that would track
pets when they strayed from their home. 
Ross and Elias were very impressed with the idea
and went about designing the app and looking at all the wonderful features that
the app could offer. When they asked Ryan if he had considered the actual GPS
device that attaches to the pet, he replied “there are a few of these on the
market just buy some one of these and design the app to run in conjunction with
the GPS unit.”
Many months followed as research and testing took
place of various GPS tracking units. The challenge was to find a unit which had
a substantial battery life, was lightweight, ‘cool’ in appearance and despite
its size and weight had sufficient power to transmit in most terrains and conditions..

All the units we found and tested had a battery
life of six or seven hours, which was considered by the team to be
unacceptable. If you were to attach a fully charged unit on your pet before
leaving for work in the morning it would be flat by the time you got home, and
what good is that. The other challenge we had was that of the units we found all
of them could only track one pet. Today it is not uncommon amongst pet owners
to have two or more pets in the one household, and that this had not been taken
into account with the current models.
Aesthetically we couldn't find anything that was
pleasing and appropriate, so it was decided that it was necessary to design our
own GPS tracker that had all the features we considered were necessary to make Pawda™
into a household name and provide peace of mind to thousands or even millions
of pet owners across the world.
We then set about to design and then engineer this
GPS tracking unit which ticked all the boxes we had identified as
essential.  

Pawda™ Prototypes:

The very first prototype was completed in September
2011 it was shaped like a watch and came with a docking station for charging as
you can see in the images below. 



Although we were very proud of our first prototype (after all
it was the culmination of 12 months work) we were concerned about the aesthetics
of the design and whether or not the design was ‘cool’ enough. 
We then embarked on some extensive market research and ran a
number of research sessions with a variety individuals, couples and families who
were representative of the future demographic of Pawda™ users.
The overwhelming results of our market research was that the
product was an exceptional idea and they all wanted one or more (which was music to
our ears of course) however, in response to whether or not Pawda™ was
aesthetically pleasing, was it trendy and cool the answer was a big no!
So armed with our Market research report and all the
suggestions made by the respondees, we set about to clear the slate and
totally redesign Pawda™.
In June 2012 we produced prototype number 2 - a whole new
look and feel for Pawda™.









Prototype
Version 2 included a plate that connected on the underside of the dog’s collar
and the Pawda™ was secured into place using the two clips on either side of the
unit. 



The
black button on the top Pawda™ is a ‘walk’ button which disarms the Pawda™ when you take your pet for a walk. This is because the Pawda™ starts to send a
signal every three minutes once the virtual perimeter has been breached.
After
using our market research result to formulate the Pawda™ version 2 we decided
we needed to go back to these same respondents and see if they felt we had
delivered a wonderful new device which would deliver ‘peace of mind to pet
lovers all over the world’. Most importantly was the device cool and of course,
would they buy one?
Again
the results were overwhelming in that they loved Pawda™ and this time they
loved the look and feel as well! Finally we had created what the market was
asking for. 
There
was however, some strong feedback regarding the clips and the bottom plate
which despite being very practical we decided to see if we could dispense with
these creating a simpler sleeker design.
Prototype Version 3 – May 2013
Since then we have been refining Pawda™ to make the
device as small as possible and at the same time maintaining its long battery
life and superior transmission capabilities. 



The latest prototype is around 30% smaller and
lighter. It also uses more advanced mapping features and has a longer battery
life. We are still testing even smaller and lighter set-ups to see how
effectively they sync up with major GPS satellite systems.

The final version (below) is stunning it is small and light whilst maintaining quality satellite contact and a serious battery life of up to seven days.. All data is sent as
secure packets, and we have optimised the app to work with all major smartphone
operating systems.



Final Prototype ready for production September 2013



Pawda™ Development
Developing Pawda™ was not just about the technical
specs. It was also about figuring out how it would be used in the real world.
This meant studying how cats and dogs interact when they are outside. Pawda™ would
not be useful if your cat could take it off and leave it in a tree! We also had
to make sure that the device would not be bothersome to your pets. During our
studies, we found that the most important elements were to:

Make the device secure so it would not come off during normal
     activity. 
Have it be light enough so that the pet would not notice it and try
     to remove it themselves. 



We also realised that we had to find the right
price point for the market. Here is how we addressed these issues. 
Secure Attachment 
First we developed clips that would attach Pawda™
to their collar and not come off. We tested them in real-time environments and
adjusted the specs of the clips until they kept the device secure even during
the most active pet play. 
Then in the second prototype we moved away from the
clips as we were improving the overall design, shape, weight and dimensions. In
our latest design the collar simply threads through two slots on the underside
of the device. 
Weight
The heaviest part of any device of this type is the
battery, which is why we designed all of our components to use the least amount
of energy possible. This means that the device eventually became light enough
so that the pets do not notice it is on their collar at all. Much of this was
accomplished by finding components that could be bundled as modules. 
Pawda™ weighs just 48 grams, which for even the
smallest dogs is virtually unnoticeable on their collar. 
Price
Finding the right price point was the most challenging part
of this process. We did surveys of potential customers and believe we have
found the right price point, however are willing to hear feedback from the Indiegogo
community.
Pawda™ will have a recommended retail price of $198 AUS.

Product Plan


The final prototype is now complete and so to are the Apple
and Android apps. We are almost ready to launch the website and our back-end
web-server (this is like the engine room of the Pawda™.







We have agreements in place with a high-quality
manufacturing facility in China. We are currently seeking agreements with
potential distributors.



Geography and Languages
Pawda™ will work globally which includes Oceania,
Asia, Middle East, Africa, North America, South America, Europe and the United
Kingdom. The app will be available in all of the major languages in those areas
including
Mandarin, Spanish, English, Hindi, Arabic, Portuguese,
Bengali, Russian, Japanese and Javanese.

When you accumulate a minimum balance, you can request to lift it up through a gift card, mastercard or paypal account and use it as you wish!
2. The trusted advertising
You will continue doing word-of-mouth with your friends, but now you can win with it.
3. Self-expression
It empowers your identity! You share what you love!







- If you have a Brand and want to advertise it, here's how it works:After we launch the platform, you only need to register your 
store and print the personalized QRcode. Then, you can start enjoying your client's 
advertising.Your employees can inform your customers to share the “Post Ad” by giving them the QRcode.You still maintain complete control over your image. Our web platform helps you keep track and supervise the brand advertising shared by your clients.






Our Strenghs



1. The best advertising always come from the clients
Brands have always tried to turn the loyalty and satisfaction of their customeres into ""media"". Now they can do it in a much easier way.
2. No investment costs
The brand only pays for the customer recommendation after he shares it. There are no previous costs. 
Also, is free to use WinShareZ web platform.
3. The range
Nowadays, if you have a brand you want to advertise, the web is your best option. Trust your message to your customers, and they will spread it all across the web.








*The source of number of friends.


- The payment
The payment for your customer per Post Ad has a minimum value of $1.
If he gets shares and likes, he can receive + $1. This extra $1 for shares and likes helps to increase the impact of your add.This way, 1 Post Ad published by your custumer can reach a minimum of 504 friends = $0,004 by friend.
- New customers
The brands can acquire new customers just through recommendations from their current customers.
- Confidence
A brand that allows the client to advertise its image, is a brand that inspires confidence and gives value to the customer.
- Brand positioning
WinShareZ increase the brands differentiation factor.

At 1000 Jordan McMichael and Cody Lawton will be shaving their head.**</b></p><p>We are raising money for The V Foundation for Cancer Research. Many of us have been affected by cancer in one way or another and we all want to fight back against it. Please join us in raising money for this great cause.</p><p>Serving as the heartbeat of The V Foundation for Cancer Research, formed by ESPN and Jim Valvano in 1993, his words throughout the ESPY speech inspire millions to get involved. After being diagnosed with cancer at the young age of 46, Jim dreamed of finding cures for cancer. Passionate and committed, he wanted to see his fight through to victory. As a former coach, he began to recruit his team of family and friends to lead The Foundation in his quest to eradicate the disease.</p><p>As a cancer patient, Jim recognized the need to invest in young physicians and scientists to help establish their careers—after all, someone had invested in him early in his career! Addressing the need to help early-career cancer investigators develop into promising research talents was the first goal of The Foundation.

At 1000 Jordan McMichael and Cody Lawton will be shaving their head.**We are raising money for The V Foundation for Cancer Research. Many of us have been affected by cancer in one way or another and we all want to fight back against it. Please join us in raising money for this great cause.Serving as the heartbeat of The V Foundation for Cancer Research, formed by ESPN and Jim Valvano in 1993, his words throughout the ESPY speech inspire millions to get involved. After being diagnosed with cancer at the young age of 46, Jim dreamed of finding cures for cancer. Passionate and committed, he wanted to see his fight through to victory. As a former coach, he began to recruit his team of family and friends to lead The Foundation in his quest to eradicate the disease.As a cancer patient, Jim recognized the need to invest in young physicians and scientists to help establish their careers—after all, someone had invested in him early in his career! Addressing the need to help early-career cancer investigators develop into promising research talents was the first goal of The Foundation.

<h2>WHO ARE WE &amp; WHAT ARE WE UP TO?</h2>
<p><br/>Diamond Fortress Technologies, Inc is a software company based in <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://diamondfortress.com/images/psd%20for%20white%20background%20Transparent.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Birmingham, AL and we are proud to introduce to the world our awesome new software module called innerID®.   Basically, innerID® is a software module developed for mobile devices that allows you to scan, match and authenticate your fingerprint using nothing but the the device's existing camera. <em>So what does this mean?!  </em></p>
<h2>THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY...</h2>
<p>What would YOUR world look like if you NEVER had to remember a user name and password again? What if every purchase you made on your mobile devices was completely secured and facilitated by your fingerprint?  What if the only way your mobile phone or tablet could be accessed was by a quick scan of your finger?  What if doors were opened, cars were started, and you clocked in at work with NOTHING but your fingerprint?  innerID® gives us endless possibilities to expand security, freedom, and convenience in our rapidly growing mobile world.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://diamondfortress.com/images/inneridsinglehand.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>WE NEED YOU!</h2>
<p>We are grateful that you would consider helping us fund a few of our projects. Right now we are developing two mobile apps utilizing innerID®:   </p>
<h2><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://wallock.diamondfortress.com/images/Walock%20logo.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></strong></h2>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Device Unlock App</h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Using innerID®  we plan to develop our WALlock app that will give you the ability to unlock your phone or tablet with the quick scan of the finger.  That means no more 4-digit pins, no more more patterns with your finger...just the camera taking a picture.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Currently for Android-based devices only, but we will keep you updated.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h2>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://walit.diamondfortress.com/images/Walit%20Logo%20Transparent.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Mobile Wallet App</h2>
<p><span>Using innerID®  we plan to develop our WALit app that stores all of your existing usernames and passwords, credit card information, driver's license, gift cards, tickets, and any other sensitive information.  With the quick scan of your finger, you can login to any website, instantaneously complete the checkout process at a retailer's mobile site, access tickets you've purchased, and much more!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Both projects will be designed for consumers and should be available in app stores by the end of the summer. </span></p>
<h2>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>
<p>Our technology utilizes the devices existing camera to capture a picture of your fingerprint. Upon enrollment, the initial image of your print is converted to a template, which is stored in a secure database and the original image is destroyed.  When you go to unlock, check out, sign in or authorize, the camera will scan your fingerprint and compare the second template with the first. Using a set of complex algorithms and high tech engineering, the fingerprints are captured, converted and matched - all in the blink of an eye.  Not only is this one of the most secure authentication methods on the planet, it takes a lot less time and brain power to remember and type in a password!</p>
<h2>TOUCHLESS FINGERPRINT BIOMETRICS... SIMPLY BETTER</h2>
<p>For years, some of the biggest companies in the world <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/27/us-authentec-acquisition-apple-idUSBRE86Q0KD20120727"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">have been aggressively trying to put biometrics on mobile devices</a> because we all know that usernames and passwords have become too difficult and cumbersome to keep track of.  Additionally, when a website or device verifies your username and password, all it is saying is ""we verify that the user knows the username and password.""  It does not, however, know that it is the right user!</p>
<p>But what if a website, bank or your device did more than verify that you know the correct credentials, <strong>what if it <em>recognized</em> you?</strong>  Fingerprint biometrics is clearly the answer to move the world from 'authentication' to 'recognition,' and our apps are clearly the answer to utilizing one of the world's most secure and convenient recognition methods NOW!</p>
<p>Like we said earlier, some of the biggest companies in the world are hard at work trying to introduce this technology to the mobile world.  Even bulky peripherals have been invented to attach to your device.  Here are the two main problems: </p>
<p>1. Everyone is trying to incorporate biometrics on mobile devices using <strong>touch-based sensors</strong>.  Touch-based sensors get dirty, they wear out, they don't work half the time, and they are expensive to manufacture and integrate into new devices, meaning phones and tablets have to be redesigned to simply fit in the sensors!</p>
<p>2. Even if phone and tablet manufacturers manage to spend the money, redesign the devices, and manufacture millions of sensors, we STILL won't be able to use this technology until they are introduced on (the most expensive) mobile phones and tablets sometime in the future!</p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER, our biometrics software works on your phone and your tablet TODAY!</strong> Not only is your phone or tablet able to utilize these apps today, they will even work with some phones and tablets manufactured 2-3 years ago!  <em>A full list of tested devices will be provided soon. </em></p>
<h2>DOES IT REALLY WORK?</h2>
<p>Yes!  We just completed our first round of testing in an uncontrolled environment, and the testing results were nothing short of amazing.  For a closer look at our results, <a href=""http://diamondfortress.com/index.php/news/102-test-results"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Our system delivers unparalleled matching performance,<em> <strong>far exceeding</strong></em> current industry leading biometric matching systems and federal standards set forth by <a href=""http://www.nist.gov/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NIST</a> and used by organizations such as the FBI.</p>
<h2>OUR FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>

WHO ARE WE & WHAT ARE WE UP TO?
Diamond Fortress Technologies, Inc is a software company based in Birmingham, AL and we are proud to introduce to the world our awesome new software module called innerID®.   Basically, innerID® is a software module developed for mobile devices that allows you to scan, match and authenticate your fingerprint using nothing but the the device's existing camera. So what does this mean?!  
THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY...
What would YOUR world look like if you NEVER had to remember a user name and password again? What if every purchase you made on your mobile devices was completely secured and facilitated by your fingerprint?  What if the only way your mobile phone or tablet could be accessed was by a quick scan of your finger?  What if doors were opened, cars were started, and you clocked in at work with NOTHING but your fingerprint?  innerID® gives us endless possibilities to expand security, freedom, and convenience in our rapidly growing mobile world.

WE NEED YOU!
We are grateful that you would consider helping us fund a few of our projects. Right now we are developing two mobile apps utilizing innerID®:   

Device Unlock App
Using innerID®  we plan to develop our WALlock app that will give you the ability to unlock your phone or tablet with the quick scan of the finger.  That means no more 4-digit pins, no more more patterns with your finger...just the camera taking a picture.
Currently for Android-based devices only, but we will keep you updated.
 


Mobile Wallet App
Using innerID®  we plan to develop our WALit app that stores all of your existing usernames and passwords, credit card information, driver's license, gift cards, tickets, and any other sensitive information.  With the quick scan of your finger, you can login to any website, instantaneously complete the checkout process at a retailer's mobile site, access tickets you've purchased, and much more!
 
Both projects will be designed for consumers and should be available in app stores by the end of the summer. 
HOW DOES IT WORK?
Our technology utilizes the devices existing camera to capture a picture of your fingerprint. Upon enrollment, the initial image of your print is converted to a template, which is stored in a secure database and the original image is destroyed.  When you go to unlock, check out, sign in or authorize, the camera will scan your fingerprint and compare the second template with the first. Using a set of complex algorithms and high tech engineering, the fingerprints are captured, converted and matched - all in the blink of an eye.  Not only is this one of the most secure authentication methods on the planet, it takes a lot less time and brain power to remember and type in a password!
TOUCHLESS FINGERPRINT BIOMETRICS... SIMPLY BETTER
For years, some of the biggest companies in the world have been aggressively trying to put biometrics on mobile devices because we all know that usernames and passwords have become too difficult and cumbersome to keep track of.  Additionally, when a website or device verifies your username and password, all it is saying is ""we verify that the user knows the username and password.""  It does not, however, know that it is the right user!
But what if a website, bank or your device did more than verify that you know the correct credentials, what if it recognized you?  Fingerprint biometrics is clearly the answer to move the world from 'authentication' to 'recognition,' and our apps are clearly the answer to utilizing one of the world's most secure and convenient recognition methods NOW!
Like we said earlier, some of the biggest companies in the world are hard at work trying to introduce this technology to the mobile world.  Even bulky peripherals have been invented to attach to your device.  Here are the two main problems: 
1. Everyone is trying to incorporate biometrics on mobile devices using touch-based sensors.  Touch-based sensors get dirty, they wear out, they don't work half the time, and they are expensive to manufacture and integrate into new devices, meaning phones and tablets have to be redesigned to simply fit in the sensors!
2. Even if phone and tablet manufacturers manage to spend the money, redesign the devices, and manufacture millions of sensors, we STILL won't be able to use this technology until they are introduced on (the most expensive) mobile phones and tablets sometime in the future!
HOWEVER, our biometrics software works on your phone and your tablet TODAY! Not only is your phone or tablet able to utilize these apps today, they will even work with some phones and tablets manufactured 2-3 years ago!  A full list of tested devices will be provided soon. 
DOES IT REALLY WORK?
Yes!  We just completed our first round of testing in an uncontrolled environment, and the testing results were nothing short of amazing.  For a closer look at our results, click here.
Our system delivers unparalleled matching performance, far exceeding current industry leading biometric matching systems and federal standards set forth by NIST and used by organizations such as the FBI.
OUR FINAL THOUGHTS

<p>When it comes to computing on the go, it’s difficult to find the perfect device…</p>
<p>Laptops have lots of processing power and plentiful applications, but they are bulky and difficult to travel with. Tablets are portable and versatile, but they lack the convenience of a keyboard and only support limited software. </p>
<p>That’s why we made Falcon - a portable, powerful, and functional 2-in-1, 8-inch laptop. It combines the best benefits of both laptops and tablets with advanced features and an affordable price. </p>

When it comes to computing on the go, it’s difficult to find the perfect device…
Laptops have lots of processing power and plentiful applications, but they are bulky and difficult to travel with. Tablets are portable and versatile, but they lack the convenience of a keyboard and only support limited software. 
That’s why we made Falcon - a portable, powerful, and functional 2-in-1, 8-inch laptop. It combines the best benefits of both laptops and tablets with advanced features and an affordable price. 
 
Watch Video | Business | Reading
 

 
 

 

 
 Easy to Use, Easy to Carry
Falcon’s 8 inch size strikes the perfect balance between performance and portability. It has a gorgeous IPS capacitive touch screen and a comfortable, ergonomic keyboard that makes work a breeze. When it’s time to move, Falcon folds into a compact tablet that is lightweight and easy to carry. 
 

 
 Laptop Mode 
Falcon has two modes to perfectly suit any situation. Its laptop mode is for times when power and performance are essential. It features a backlit keyboard that is large enough for comfortable and effective work or communications, an OFN mouse for precision and convenience, and a capacitive touchscreen for quick access to programs and gaming.  
 

 
 Tablet Mode
Falcon can be easily transformed into a tablet. After closing the keyboard, it locks automatically for one-handed touchscreen control that makes reading, gaming and note-taking more comfortable and effective at home, office, or on the go. 
 

 

 
Big on Power
Falcon runs on a powerful Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 quad-core processor, enough processing power for virtually any typical application. It also features 8GB RAM and up to 256GB SSD storage for files, music and video, and a 1920 x 1200 resolution Corning Gorilla Glass touchscreen. It operates on the reliable Windows 10 Home system and Ubuntu.
 

 
Small in Size
Falcon weighs only 1.5 lbs – compact enough to easily fit in your bag. It can be held with one hand and is perfect for home, travel, work and everyday tasks.
 

 

 
Ports
Though small in size, Falcon is packed with ports to give you the ultimate in connectivity. It features one USB Type-C port, one USB Type-A port, an HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The Type-C port can be used for both charging and expansion.
 

 
Battery Life
Active lifestyles require plenty of power! Power-hungry full size laptops often can’t get you through the day but Falcon’s battery has enough capacity to power your fun and games for up to 8 hours. 
 

 

 
Falcon Pen
Falcon pen uses 1024 Levels of Pressure Sensitivity. It provides high sensitivity and precise writing & graphic arts control. It is the perfect addition when pin-point accuracy is required for high level tasks, graphic design and art.
 

 
Active Cooling | G-Sensor | Backlit Keyboard | OFN Mouse 
Falcon has the convenience of a tablet with the features of a laptop including G-Sensor for movement control, Backlit Keyboard for ease of use, an OFN mouse for track point control, and Active Cooling (don’t worry you can turn off the fan for a quieter mode if you choose). With Falcon, you have all the power and performance you need. 
 

 
Outstanding Design
Uni-body design and precision machined aluminum-magnesium case for strength and a sleek look.

I've iterated through dozens of generations before choosing the current production-ready model.</i></p><h3>Why Help Us?</h3><p>At Esington, we believe that within each of us lies the untapped potential of a great person.  A person worthy of leaving a long-lasting legacy.  Our goal is to give you the tools you need to untap that potential.</p><p>We have the prototypes you see here.  I’ve been using them flawlessly for months.  We are asking for your help to get us to the minimum order quantity from the manufacturer.  In exchange for your pledge, we’re offering the first run for a significantly discounted price.  Click the back this project button and help us make the Esington glass a reality.</p><h3>Why I Made the Esington Glass</h3><p>Until about three years ago, my life was pretty uneventful.  I had a decent job, a few close friends and family, and I had my health.  My trajectory was “live in obscurity and die a nobody.” Deep down I knew I wanted more, but life was comfortable, so I put off thinking about it too much.  </p><p>Then I found the love of my life and got married.  Less than a year later, my son was born.  This woke something up inside of me that had been buried all of these years.  I now had a reason much more important than myself to become someone worth looking up to.  I needed to earn my place in the world and build a legacy my son would be proud of.  The problem was I lacked discipline and was even lazy at times.  </p><p>I read everything I could on productivity and habits.  There were three main points I came across in my research:</p><p>First, I had a strong concept of myself as a lazy, unproductive person by nature.  I thought it was just my personality - in my genes.  I realized I had to destroy that concept if I was going to get anywhere.  Everything I read pointed to there being no such thing as a lazy nature.  It was a lifetime of incorrect thinking that I had to rewrite.</p><p>Second, I had to convince myself that I deserved success.  This is a lot harder than it sounds. Getting through step one was key to this, but looking yourself in the mirror and saying “I deserve to be successful” really isn’t easy without a twinge of apprehension.  </p><p>Finally, the third step was implementing some framework around which I could build habits that would reinforce both of these ideas.  Habits that would destroy the concept of laziness being inherent and convince me that I deserved success.</p><p>This led me to the concept of a “keystone habit.”  A keystone habit is a small change in your life that results in a cascade of positive, transformative changes.  It’s like the overweight pizza delivery guy who decides to go for a walk each morning and becomes CEO of a Fortune 500 company who runs marathons.  His keystone habit was walking in the park each morning. Anyone who has turned their life around started with a keystone habit.</p><p>So how did I find my keystone habit?  Well, first I tried dozens of little habits like running or biking every day, pushups in the morning, writing every day, and many other small things. None of them stuck. None of them caused any sort of cascading effect.  Either I couldn’t get the habit to stick, or it just wasn’t the right habit to change my core.</p><p>Finally, I took the simple idea of attacking my procrastination directly with a concept called timeboxing.  With timeboxing, you allow yourself a fixed amount of time to accomplish a task.  I used a timer on my computer to give myself 25 minutes in which to work, followed by a few minutes of rest.  This felt good and I got a lot of work done in those 25 minutes, because my brain understood that it only had to work for 25 minutes, then it would get a break. Research shows that you can train yourself to get “hyperfocused” and get way more work done if you timebox in this way. Also, your work quality is better and you are more creative if you force yourself to take regular breaks like this.  </p><p>There was one big problem.  Even though I was way more productive when I used this method, I found myself not using it that often.  It felt like another case of “lazy brain”. I had spent a year going through dozens of books, making what I thought were great mental strides.  I put everything I had into trying to get better, but it seemed like I was back at square one.  I felt like maybe I really was just genetically wired to be a loser.</p><p>After a few days of sulking, I wondered if the activation energy was too high for me to form the habit. Maybe it was the timer itself! I hypothesized that I needed more physical triggers and fewer barriers (such as finding my timing program, clicking a button and then trying to refocus on the task at hand) to help the habit form.</p><p>This led me to search for a physical timer I could put on my desk.  There were timers designed specifically for this task, but they were all cheap, plastic, noisy devices.  Plus, they were designed for a ""hard stop"".  They all had disruptive noises when it was time to quit.  Sometimes I was in the zone and didn't want that terrible intrusion.</p><p>I wanted something that I looked forward to holding in my hand.  A work of art I could be proud of, and something that subtly hinted that it was time to begin the 25 minute habit cycle.  I searched far and wide, but simply could not find anything affordable that fit the bill.  So I made my own.</p><p>My goal for the Esington glass was to create a timer that made forming the timeboxing habit as easy as possible.  I wanted to lower the activation energy to the smallest possible amount.  It’s a beautiful handblown piece of art.  You want to hold it, you are proud to keep it on your desk.  It is stunning.  When you turn it over, you are greeted with beautiful white noise as the steel nanospheres bounce off the glass in every direction.  This is an amazingly effective signal to your brain that it’s time to get things done.  It’s a subtle change over a regular hourglass, but it’s amazingly effective.  With the prototype, which I use every day, I formed the habit within a week.  It’s specifically designed for the job.</p><p>The change to my life has been dramatic.  I have always considered myself a laid-back, procrastinating slacker with big dreams.  Now I get more done in a day than I used to in a week.  This is not an exaggeration. Here are some things I’ve done in the last 90 days with this habit in place:</p><ul>
<li>Learned how to code in PHP and launched 3 separate software companies - I’m not a programmer and have no formal training.</li>
<li>Created two business partnerships in foreign markets and learned basic Russian</li>
<li>Wrote a research heavy health book, the first book I ever wrote</li>
<li>Created and launched my first Kickstarter</li>
<li>Read 27 books</li>
</ul><p>I didn’t change my diet or take any drugs.  I’m actually drinking less coffee than I was 90 days ago.  How does that compare to the 90 day period before I created this habit?  Honestly, I don’t really remember doing much other than going to work and coming home tired.  I don’t even remember reading a single book. The change to my life was truly transformative.</p><p>Thank you for letting me share my story with you.  I feel grateful to have found a tool that has helped me become the person I knew I could become. I sincerely hope the Esington glass changes your life for the better in the same way.</p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>We have the prototypes ready and have lined up a primary and secondary manufacturer. The process for creating the glass are new to the industry, so the large-scale yield has yet to be tested. We believe that our exhaustive experimentation will pay off and that we will meet the above timeline. In the event the yield is lower than expected due to the complicated and artisan-heavy work, shipping may be delayed, but we guarantee the products will ship.</p></div>","The Esington Glass is a powerful motivating force in a simple, elegant and beautiful package. Esington Glass productivity timers are filled with beautiful black sand.

I've iterated through dozens of generations before choosing the current production-ready model.Why Help Us?At Esington, we believe that within each of us lies the untapped potential of a great person.  A person worthy of leaving a long-lasting legacy.  Our goal is to give you the tools you need to untap that potential.We have the prototypes you see here.  I’ve been using them flawlessly for months.  We are asking for your help to get us to the minimum order quantity from the manufacturer.  In exchange for your pledge, we’re offering the first run for a significantly discounted price.  Click the back this project button and help us make the Esington glass a reality.Why I Made the Esington GlassUntil about three years ago, my life was pretty uneventful.  I had a decent job, a few close friends and family, and I had my health.  My trajectory was “live in obscurity and die a nobody.” Deep down I knew I wanted more, but life was comfortable, so I put off thinking about it too much.  Then I found the love of my life and got married.  Less than a year later, my son was born.  This woke something up inside of me that had been buried all of these years.  I now had a reason much more important than myself to become someone worth looking up to.  I needed to earn my place in the world and build a legacy my son would be proud of.  The problem was I lacked discipline and was even lazy at times.  I read everything I could on productivity and habits.  There were three main points I came across in my research:First, I had a strong concept of myself as a lazy, unproductive person by nature.  I thought it was just my personality - in my genes.  I realized I had to destroy that concept if I was going to get anywhere.  Everything I read pointed to there being no such thing as a lazy nature.  It was a lifetime of incorrect thinking that I had to rewrite.Second, I had to convince myself that I deserved success.  This is a lot harder than it sounds. Getting through step one was key to this, but looking yourself in the mirror and saying “I deserve to be successful” really isn’t easy without a twinge of apprehension.  Finally, the third step was implementing some framework around which I could build habits that would reinforce both of these ideas.  Habits that would destroy the concept of laziness being inherent and convince me that I deserved success.This led me to the concept of a “keystone habit.”  A keystone habit is a small change in your life that results in a cascade of positive, transformative changes.  It’s like the overweight pizza delivery guy who decides to go for a walk each morning and becomes CEO of a Fortune 500 company who runs marathons.  His keystone habit was walking in the park each morning. Anyone who has turned their life around started with a keystone habit.So how did I find my keystone habit?  Well, first I tried dozens of little habits like running or biking every day, pushups in the morning, writing every day, and many other small things. None of them stuck. None of them caused any sort of cascading effect.  Either I couldn’t get the habit to stick, or it just wasn’t the right habit to change my core.Finally, I took the simple idea of attacking my procrastination directly with a concept called timeboxing.  With timeboxing, you allow yourself a fixed amount of time to accomplish a task.  I used a timer on my computer to give myself 25 minutes in which to work, followed by a few minutes of rest.  This felt good and I got a lot of work done in those 25 minutes, because my brain understood that it only had to work for 25 minutes, then it would get a break. Research shows that you can train yourself to get “hyperfocused” and get way more work done if you timebox in this way. Also, your work quality is better and you are more creative if you force yourself to take regular breaks like this.  There was one big problem.  Even though I was way more productive when I used this method, I found myself not using it that often.  It felt like another case of “lazy brain”. I had spent a year going through dozens of books, making what I thought were great mental strides.  I put everything I had into trying to get better, but it seemed like I was back at square one.  I felt like maybe I really was just genetically wired to be a loser.After a few days of sulking, I wondered if the activation energy was too high for me to form the habit. Maybe it was the timer itself! I hypothesized that I needed more physical triggers and fewer barriers (such as finding my timing program, clicking a button and then trying to refocus on the task at hand) to help the habit form.This led me to search for a physical timer I could put on my desk.  There were timers designed specifically for this task, but they were all cheap, plastic, noisy devices.  Plus, they were designed for a ""hard stop"".  They all had disruptive noises when it was time to quit.  Sometimes I was in the zone and didn't want that terrible intrusion.I wanted something that I looked forward to holding in my hand.  A work of art I could be proud of, and something that subtly hinted that it was time to begin the 25 minute habit cycle.  I searched far and wide, but simply could not find anything affordable that fit the bill.  So I made my own.My goal for the Esington glass was to create a timer that made forming the timeboxing habit as easy as possible.  I wanted to lower the activation energy to the smallest possible amount.  It’s a beautiful handblown piece of art.  You want to hold it, you are proud to keep it on your desk.  It is stunning.  When you turn it over, you are greeted with beautiful white noise as the steel nanospheres bounce off the glass in every direction.  This is an amazingly effective signal to your brain that it’s time to get things done.  It’s a subtle change over a regular hourglass, but it’s amazingly effective.  With the prototype, which I use every day, I formed the habit within a week.  It’s specifically designed for the job.The change to my life has been dramatic.  I have always considered myself a laid-back, procrastinating slacker with big dreams.  Now I get more done in a day than I used to in a week.  This is not an exaggeration. Here are some things I’ve done in the last 90 days with this habit in place:
Learned how to code in PHP and launched 3 separate software companies - I’m not a programmer and have no formal training.
Created two business partnerships in foreign markets and learned basic Russian
Wrote a research heavy health book, the first book I ever wrote
Created and launched my first Kickstarter
Read 27 books
I didn’t change my diet or take any drugs.  I’m actually drinking less coffee than I was 90 days ago.  How does that compare to the 90 day period before I created this habit?  Honestly, I don’t really remember doing much other than going to work and coming home tired.  I don’t even remember reading a single book. The change to my life was truly transformative.Thank you for letting me share my story with you.  I feel grateful to have found a tool that has helped me become the person I knew I could become. I sincerely hope the Esington glass changes your life for the better in the same way.Risks and challengesWe have the prototypes ready and have lined up a primary and secondary manufacturer. The process for creating the glass are new to the industry, so the large-scale yield has yet to be tested. We believe that our exhaustive experimentation will pay off and that we will meet the above timeline. In the event the yield is lower than expected due to the complicated and artisan-heavy work, shipping may be delayed, but we guarantee the products will ship.",7.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h4><b>Why are the 7 Simple Daily Activities Important to Mom &amp; Baby?</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">1. Monitoring </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Weight Gain</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/609/050/c540a2526d86343f6bb05939020e9d41_large.png?1411140161"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Eating for Two?</b> Current studies show that too much weight gain during pregnancy could be dangerous to the mother and baby. Too little weight gain can also be harmful. WOW! Do you know what your optimal weight gain is week by week? How do you track it? The DoulaRoom app and wireless scale will chart your progress daily.</p>
<p>2. Taking <b>Blood Pressure</b></p>
<div>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/609/197/093b3de79932605edf0c043da0f1f7fc_large.png?1411142618"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Under Pressure?</b> So if you have never had a problem with blood pressure why worry now? Many women start out with normal blood pressure but then have it rise during pregnancy. Increased blood pressure could lead to decreased oxygen to the placenta and to the baby, which could lead to decreased growth of the baby and decreased brain development. The DoulaRoom app and wireless blood pressure monitor helps you track and record your blood pressure daily or as recommended by your medical professional. We are making it easy for you and saving you time. </p>
<p>3. Tracking<b> Water Intake</b></p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/609/199/a4716b7860ed4b2bf94673f1bcf7ecad_large.png?1411142658"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Cheers!</b> Most studies and experts agree that expectant moms should drink 6-8 glasses of water a day. Why? Too little water could lead to blood clots or urinary track infections. Later in pregnancy it could lead to uterine irritability and false labor. It is also very important for women experiencing nausea to have adequate water intake. DoulaRoom makes it easy for you to track your daily water intake.</p>
<p>4. Remembering to take<b> Vitamins</b></p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/609/201/9d2c72993484656945b58b5b6832d317_large.png?1411142693"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Who can remember?</b> Under a physician’s direction there are three main supplements which are commonly recommended. A prenatal vitamin is a general dietary supplement, which helps baby’s over all development. Folic acid is important early in pregnancy for the prevention of neural tube defects. Iron levels in pregnancy are important to ensure adequate oxygen levels in the blood to support baby’s growth &amp; development. DoulaRoom helps you track and remember to take the supplements recommended by your health care provider.</p>
<p>5. Recording <b>Mother’s Activity</b></p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/609/206/32f90844339a3fb9966afde9cf43a5d2_large.png?1411142727"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Give me credit!</b> Activity is an important part of a normal pregnancy. Studies have shown that too little activity can lead to unhealthy weight gain during pregnancy, which may contribute to post partum depression. 10,000 steps a day is a goal for everyone, however who has time to count and record their steps? The DoulaRoom app and activity bracelet will track your steps automatically.</p>
<p>6. Listening to <b>Baby’s Heart Beat </b>and noting Activity</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/609/211/ffb0f6b42b8668bbdbf88b8708a73cab_large.png?1411142751"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Who kicked me? </b>Moms usually start becoming aware of baby’s movement between 18-22 weeks and from this point moms should be aware of baby’s movement at least once a day. At 36 weeks till delivery it is important to track the baby’s kick counts daily. Kick counts involve tracking baby moving 10 times in 2 hours once a day.The DoulaRoom app helps remind you and record this activity.</p>
<p><b>Baby’s Heart Beat</b></p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/609/242/f2923631c632efd5f976de35203bb470_large.png?1411143197"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Here is the WOW factor!</b> Every mom is different but it is normal from 12 -14 weeks to be able to hear your baby’s heart beat. Today this happens during prenatal visits. Now with the DoulaRoom app and fetal doppler it is possible to hear, record and share the sound of your baby with family and friends regardless of geographic distance.</p>
<p>7. Logbook recording of <b>Discomforts Felt </b>and concerns </p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/609/215/b9e9730a4d3a1cb5b584941de55cf128_large.png?1411142807"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p><b>How many more weeks?</b> Minor discomforts are a normal part of pregnancy. The majority do not cause short or long term problems but it is important to know what you can do and take for normal discomforts. Knowing what is normal and when to seek medical advice is critical. DoulaRoom helps you track your symptoms and directs you to some of the top authoritative sources of information. It is important to consult with your medical provider about any concerns you may have.</p>
<h4><b><br/></b></h4>
<h4><b>Mothers have spoken … </b></h4>
<p>By listening to expectant mothers like you, we have already included additional features to Empower, Inform and Support you during your pregnancy.  </p>
<p></p>
<h4></h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/942605/files/20141019124726-Slide1.jpg?1413748046"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h4>The Impact!</h4>
<p>The expectant mother is the center of her circle of care! DoulaRoom lets the mother decide who she shares her information with. She can share it with her partner, parents, best friend, family, and medical team, without concern for information security or geographic distances. Imagine your mom, best friend, or sister who lives across the country or in another part of the world being able to see in <i>real time</i> how you are doing, know how you are feeling and hearing your baby’s heart beat. What if your partner is in the military or has to travel for work? DoulaRoom will enable them to support you and experience the pregnancy with you.</p>
<p>We have also created a DoulaRoom medical provider app so that your entire care team (Doctors, Nurses, Midwifes, etc.) can have, <b>with your permission</b>, a summarized view of your data which they can expand in greater detail to see what is happening – in real time. Our medical team is developing  customizable automated alerts in a future release.</p>
<p>We believe strongly in improving the world, so as we develop and grow, a percentage of our revenue will be used to help mothers in need. This includes women in developing countries as well as developed countries that may not have the resources to access support. Our team is already working on publishing a book to support women globally.</p>
<h4><b>What have we built so far?</b></h4>
<p>We are piloting our first version and are already working on the next.</p>
<p>Here is what we will deliver in the first version to our mothers and medical teams who join us in building a better world.</p>
<p>Version 1 of our app helps the mother track and monitor the important aspects of the pregnancy that we have described.  Our team has worked very hard to ensure we are helping to track and provide the right information for the expectant mother <b><i>while making it easy to use</i></b>. For weight, blood pressure, and activity we are leveraging wireless technology so that information is loaded from the DoulaRoom devices to your smart phone.

<p><b>Frequently Asked Questions?</b></p>
<p>·<b>What is a Doula?</b></p>
<p>A doula is a non medical person who provides emotional and physical support to a woman and her family before, during and after labor. The assistance of a doula is often associated with improved maternal and fetal health. A doula performs no medical duties or decision-making, deferring instead to nurses, midwives, and doctors.</p>
<p>·<b>What is DoulaRoom?</b></p>
<p>DoulaRoom is a mobile app for pregnant women and their families. It provides current online resources, which empowers the expectant mother to be an active and informed collaborator in her healthcare during her pregnancy. As well, it enables her to share her physical and emotional journey with her support circle, regardless of their geographic location. DoulaRoom like a doula performs no medical duties or decision-making, deferring instead to nurses, midwives, and doctors. </p>
<p><b>·Can DoulaRoom work with the integrated devices on iOS and Android?</b></p>
<p>DoulaRoom is designed to work on both the Android and iOS operating systems. Both phone and tablet form factors are supported. The seamless integration of the blood pressure monitor, weigh scale and activity bracelet require the phone or tablet to be compatible with BlueTooth 4.0 standards. Most current phones and tables support this. To make it easier for you we have added the link below where you can check if you are not sure. Even if your phone or tablet are of an older version we have made it so you can still input all the device information manually and still benefit from the features to Empower, Inform and Support you. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart-Devices-List.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Bluetooth-Smart-Devices-List.aspx</a></p>
<p><b>What do I do with the DoulaRoom devices after I have my baby?</b></p>
<p>Your personal health is just as important to you, your family and your newborn after you deliver as it was during your pregnancy. Our medical team’s advice is to continue to using the weight scale, blood pressure monitor and activity bracelet to help manage your health. If you are not planning to have any more pregnancies you could gift or sell the fetal doppler.</p>
<p>·<b>Is DoulaRoom a medical app or a technology app?</b></p>
<p>Neither. DoulaRoom is designed to provide a better way for pregnant women to be in control and empowered during their pregnancies. Not all pregnancies require medical interventions; however wouldn’t it be nice to know what the important measures like blood pressure and fetal heart rate should be on a daily basis? This is not about technology. Technology is being leveraged to keep the expectant woman informed with trusted sources of information and to help her circle of care be there to support her regardless of geographic boundaries.</p>
<p>·<b>Are the devices safe for the woman and baby?</b></p>
<p>Yes, We are working directly with the manufacture to build devices to our specification that are high quality, safe, easy to integrate and use. They are all meet certification standards. </p>
<p><b>·Does my midwife, doctor, and care team have to sign up? What if I do not want to share my information? </b></p>
<p>The DoulaRoom app provides benefits to an expectant mom independent of her medical care team. It is the expectant mom’s choice who she wants to bring into her circle of care. If a midwife, doctor, clinic, or hospital sign up and download the DoulaRoom provider app the expectant mom can send them and invite to join her circle. Our goal is to bring together expectant mom and all her circle of care together to provide a better supporting experience.  </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Why are the Perks in $US?</b></b></p>
<p>Our goal is to simplify every aspect of services that DoulaRoom provides. SInce we are building a global app we selected $US because: 1) it is the most global currency: 2) most of our business expenses for infrastructure and devices are in $US. For these reasons we wanted to focus our attention on building and delivering the best experience to you and not be focused on the crazy world of currency exchange.  </p>
<p><b>How can this help women in developing countries?</b></p>
<p>While most developing countries have a shortage of medical support they commonly have extensive mobile network coverage. Our goal is to work with local governments and agencies to help identify which expectant moms are at risk so they can be prioritized and the scarce medical resources are utilized where they are most in need. Preventive healthcare provides better outcomes and cost savings.</p>

<h4>Risks and challenges</h4>
<p>As you know we are on a mission to Empower, Inform and Support women world wide throughout their pregnancy journey. You have now heard that our company philosophy is based on three pillars: </p>

<p>LEVERAGE AND INTEGRATE THE BEST TECHNOLOGY <br/>The DoulaRoom app runs on Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems. We have worked directly with our devices manufacturers to build the devices, which meet our specifications of integration, quality and ease of use. The manufacturers we have partnered with are focused on the medical industry, which means they know the importance of quality.

This was a critical decision for DoulaRoom and we are delighted with the support and commitment we have received in this partnership. We are running our business in their cloud environment and development in their global Bluemix cloud environment with MobileFirst. This gives us the confidence for scalability, availability and privacy to take this app to the world.

Today pregnancy is complex; knowing what you should be doing, where trusted information can be found and, being able to communicate when and how you want support.                          We are simplifying it for you.                      54 million pregnancies every year                             7 simple daily activities                                    1 mobile app                               Empower, Inform, and Support IMPORTANT UPDATE: We have had such great feedback on the app and are so confident that you will love it, we are going to offer the first 25 people a guarantee of LOVE.

We had some fun with the scene where four fathers are trying to figure out how they can be more supportive.(In all our videos we did not use actors, we chose to have real people with real experience. The videos will not win an Academy Award but we thank our brave friends and family for sharing in the passion.)Imagine designing a better way to support pregnant women around the world. Is there a more important population to focus on? Working together, we believe we can improve the lives of pregnant women everywhere!We are already in pilot but we need your help and feedback to continue improving and expanding.Today women around the world in developed and developing countries begin one of the most important times of their lives with an initial excitement, which often turns into fear and uncertainty. There is no other time in any person’s life where an individual is so unselfishly focused on doing the right things to support someone else. An expectant mother’s primary worries and concerns are to do the right things to support her unborn child. Today there is a wealth of information through print, web, and folk stories, but what is good information and what is bad information? Who do you trust? What if you trust the wrong source?Our goal is to build the world’s best app to Empower, Inform and Support women worldwide during their pregnancy journey!The Team: Meet the people working on DoulaRoom and hear their passion.

Why are the 7 Simple Daily Activities Important to Mom & Baby?

1. Monitoring Weight Gain


Eating for Two? Current studies show that too much weight gain during pregnancy could be dangerous to the mother and baby. Too little weight gain can also be harmful. WOW! Do you know what your optimal weight gain is week by week? How do you track it? The DoulaRoom app and wireless scale will chart your progress daily.
2. Taking Blood Pressure


Under Pressure? So if you have never had a problem with blood pressure why worry now? Many women start out with normal blood pressure but then have it rise during pregnancy. Increased blood pressure could lead to decreased oxygen to the placenta and to the baby, which could lead to decreased growth of the baby and decreased brain development. The DoulaRoom app and wireless blood pressure monitor helps you track and record your blood pressure daily or as recommended by your medical professional. We are making it easy for you and saving you time. 
3. Tracking Water Intake


Cheers! Most studies and experts agree that expectant moms should drink 6-8 glasses of water a day. Why? Too little water could lead to blood clots or urinary track infections. Later in pregnancy it could lead to uterine irritability and false labor. It is also very important for women experiencing nausea to have adequate water intake. DoulaRoom makes it easy for you to track your daily water intake.
4. Remembering to take Vitamins


Who can remember? Under a physician’s direction there are three main supplements which are commonly recommended. A prenatal vitamin is a general dietary supplement, which helps baby’s over all development. Folic acid is important early in pregnancy for the prevention of neural tube defects. Iron levels in pregnancy are important to ensure adequate oxygen levels in the blood to support baby’s growth & development. DoulaRoom helps you track and remember to take the supplements recommended by your health care provider.
5. Recording Mother’s Activity


Give me credit! Activity is an important part of a normal pregnancy. Studies have shown that too little activity can lead to unhealthy weight gain during pregnancy, which may contribute to post partum depression. 10,000 steps a day is a goal for everyone, however who has time to count and record their steps? The DoulaRoom app and activity bracelet will track your steps automatically.
6. Listening to Baby’s Heart Beat and noting Activity


Who kicked me? Moms usually start becoming aware of baby’s movement between 18-22 weeks and from this point moms should be aware of baby’s movement at least once a day. At 36 weeks till delivery it is important to track the baby’s kick counts daily. Kick counts involve tracking baby moving 10 times in 2 hours once a day.The DoulaRoom app helps remind you and record this activity.
Baby’s Heart Beat


Here is the WOW factor! Every mom is different but it is normal from 12 -14 weeks to be able to hear your baby’s heart beat. Today this happens during prenatal visits. Now with the DoulaRoom app and fetal doppler it is possible to hear, record and share the sound of your baby with family and friends regardless of geographic distance.
7. Logbook recording of Discomforts Felt and concerns 


How many more weeks? Minor discomforts are a normal part of pregnancy. The majority do not cause short or long term problems but it is important to know what you can do and take for normal discomforts. Knowing what is normal and when to seek medical advice is critical. DoulaRoom helps you track your symptoms and directs you to some of the top authoritative sources of information. It is important to consult with your medical provider about any concerns you may have.

Mothers have spoken … 
By listening to expectant mothers like you, we have already included additional features to Empower, Inform and Support you during your pregnancy.  



The Impact!
The expectant mother is the center of her circle of care! DoulaRoom lets the mother decide who she shares her information with. She can share it with her partner, parents, best friend, family, and medical team, without concern for information security or geographic distances. Imagine your mom, best friend, or sister who lives across the country or in another part of the world being able to see in real time how you are doing, know how you are feeling and hearing your baby’s heart beat. What if your partner is in the military or has to travel for work? DoulaRoom will enable them to support you and experience the pregnancy with you.
We have also created a DoulaRoom medical provider app so that your entire care team (Doctors, Nurses, Midwifes, etc.) can have, with your permission, a summarized view of your data which they can expand in greater detail to see what is happening – in real time. Our medical team is developing  customizable automated alerts in a future release.
We believe strongly in improving the world, so as we develop and grow, a percentage of our revenue will be used to help mothers in need. This includes women in developing countries as well as developed countries that may not have the resources to access support. Our team is already working on publishing a book to support women globally.
What have we built so far?
We are piloting our first version and are already working on the next.
Here is what we will deliver in the first version to our mothers and medical teams who join us in building a better world.
Version 1 of our app helps the mother track and monitor the important aspects of the pregnancy that we have described.  Our team has worked very hard to ensure we are helping to track and provide the right information for the expectant mother while making it easy to use. For weight, blood pressure, and activity we are leveraging wireless technology so that information is loaded from the DoulaRoom devices to your smart phone. The DoulaRoom app captures your baby’s heart rate and then stores the sound of the heartbeat so you can share it with others.
We are very confident that DoulaRoom will be able to improve the pregnancy journey for women. Our guiding philosophy is: 1) provide trusted and current medical information 2) leverage the best technology to make it easier 3) listen to you, so we can work together to continue to improve the app so it will be the world’s best app to empower, inform and support women worldwide during their pregnancy journey!

How our team got here is simple; we brought together a group of diverse medical, technical and business people who are top in their fields and shared one common passion; to leave a positive imprint on the world.

Shipping/Handling and Taxes/Duties/Customs

</h3><p>We're a group of one thirteen-year-old and two fourteen-year-olds going to school in Coquitlam and Surrey BC. Stefan's a digital artist, social media expert and ""techy. ""Alin's a digital artist and hardware expert. And Laef's a programmer, writer and social media ""person.""</p><p>We're working on building a website and app where people will be able to post their lost pet and other people will be able to report if they see the pet. Right now there are hundreds, probably thousands of lost pets across North America and we want to bring them home.</p><p>Though this idea has been attempted before, it has never been taken to it's full potential. For example, no one's created an app! When you hold in your hands an easy way to report the lost pet crossing the road, you'll do it!<br/></p><p>Since this is such an important task, we want to do it right. The project is set up as a .org that will make no money, but unfortunately this means that there are many things we can't pay for. You can help get this off the ground!</p><p><br/></p><h3>Where Your Money Will Go</h3><p>Since the beginning of this project, we've been paying for the development and hosting of the website ourselves. This includes $25 per month to pay for hosting. Unfortunately this hosting does not give us enough space to host the many photos of lost pets that people would upload and we don't have enough money to pay for better hosting or image hosting elsewhere.</p><p>Since this challenge came up a week ago, we've been searching around for free image hosting but none fulfill our needs. As soon as we resolved on funding it on Indiegogo, we began looking for the cheapest of the paid-for hosts for data. This brought us to Google which provides storage at $0.026 per Gigabyte per Month. Compared to many other companies that provide storage at up to $100 dollars per month for just 20GB, this is incredibly inexpensive.</p><p>Once resolving on Indiegogo, we added in a couple other things that had been nagging at us for the last few months of development but that we had not been able to pay for. After adding them all in, along with Indiegogo's 5%, we've costed the end price to be $435.07. Here are all the components, including tax, that make that up:</p><p>   •   $50 for an SSL certificate (this means that when you visit our website, your connection will be secure and safe)<br/>   •   $15  to pay back our principal for buying us FindALostPet.org<br/>   •   $30  ($15 each) to buy FindALostPet.com and FindALostPet.net and redirect them to the .org<br/>   •   $300 for the website hosting for a year (right now our parents are paying for it but we want to change that)<br/>   •   $19.35 for the image storage with Google for two years (1GB per day, 31 days per month, 24 months)<br/>   •   5% of the total added to pay Indiegogo ($20.72)</p><p>If we don't reach our goal, we'll pay first for the image storage, then for the SSL certificate, then for the website hosting and finally for everything else.</p><p>On the other hand, if we get more than what we need, we'll use it to pay for continued use of the SSL certificate, hosting and Google storage for a couple more years, as well as for online advertising for this project.<br/><br/></p><h3>Thank-You Perks</h3><p>By creating this Indiegogo campaign, we gave ourselves another problem: What should we give to those who took time to donate when in the end we're creating a free product that we want everyone to be able to use? Well, first off is your name on the website's donors' page. The bigger your donation, the larger your name and the higher up you will be!</p><p>The top few donors will get a nice Christmas card thanking them for their help. Since we'll be paying for these out of our own pocket, we'll only be able to send out ten or so.</p><p>If you're one of the first ten or so to donate $50 or more, we can give you one of the following:</p><p>   1.   We can build a small personal, project or business website for you. Nothing on the scale of a service like Google but a few static pages with pretty much whatever content you want (nothing inappropriate though).<br/>   2.   We can look at your website and give some design critique on user experience, visual content, text content and your social media presence. This is the one sure way to get all three of us to put something into your thank you perk because we all enjoy improving people's websites!<br/>   3.   If you're an educator (or student lobbying your teachers for more speeches), one of our group could conference call into your school to talk about our project, programming and how students can change the world.<br/><br/></p><h3>More About This, That and Us</h3><p>Yes, we're fourteen-year-olds, so why should you trust that we'll deliver? Well, here are a couple websites we've already released:</p><p>   •   VoteVancouver.org was a polling and voter-candidate interaction website in the 25 ridings in the Lower Mainland for the 42nd Canadian General Election. We helped connect users and candidates, giving a way for people to ask questions of the people they would elect, see by-riding polling updated live and find events hosted by the candidates in their riding.<br/>   •   TheGoodSite.org is our team's website where we collect all the cool stuff we're doing.</p><p>Both of these websites are hand-coded and hand-promoted by our team. We pour our hearts into making cool things and changing the world. And even if we can't raise the money we need, we'll still try to go ahead with it.</p><p>We've been working on this project for over two months now (and it had been an idea floating around in our heads long before). From the mock-ups created by Stefan, it has now evolved into a work in progress PHP website.</p><p>And, of course, you want to see it. Just check it out at <a href=""http://findalostpet.org/index-f.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">findalostpet.org/index-f.php</a>. You can play around with some of the buttons there but unfortunately that's not the most recent copy so the login and signup do not work. As soon as we get the money for the image hosting, we'll be releasing the final version for a beta test in the Lower Mainland (but you'll still be able to use it and get started; after all, you'll deserve it!).</p><p>If you want to watch our progress, you can check out our blog at <a href=""http://findalostpet.org/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">findalostpet.org/blog</a>. Laef tries to update it as much as possible, though often with school work and the project it's self, he doesn't get the chance.</p><p>There are a couple challenges to come, even after we set up the images. The iOS app is a bit more out of our depth and so it's a bit of a learning experience for us to build it. Getting media interested is always a big problem (we found that out the hard way with VoteVancouver). And getting people who haven't lost pets to use the app will probably be the biggest challenge but we're ready to take these challenges on.<br/><br/></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help Out</h3><p>Launching a website like this is never easy and there are many ways you can help out. The number one way is by promoting our project to your friends, family and co-workers when it comes out and by signing up!</p><p>If you have any ideas on the project, features or how we could promote it, we would be delighted/desperate to hear them! Also, if you have any connections for us (like you work at a company that would love to help out or that we could work with), please tell us.

<p>I'm an NYC artist and creative entrepreneur and I envision a world in which every individual is free to design a life of personal success. That starts with being clear on our goals &amp; tracking them. </p>
<h3><strong>My mission:</strong></h3>
<p>To inspire, encourage &amp; motivate individuals, to pave their own way to success by navigating modern-day life and creating success on their own terms.  </p>
<h3><strong>The Product: A planner.</strong></h3>
<p>I created my own planner because as a busy, commuting, NYC woman, I didn't want to carry a big, bulky planner anymore. Especially a spiral-bound planner that would get stuck on my sweaters and cling to my purse pockets or get my keys mixed into them. </p>
<p>If I have one word to describe how I feel about writing things down in a planner, it would be: Grateful! </p>
<p>Why? Because if it wasn't for writing things down and constantly looking at them, I wouldn't be where I am today. </p>
<p>My planners won't just have lines across a page, it will have inspirational quotes, a space to write what your leading affirmation for the month is, and very importantly, a place to write down your Quarterly and Monthly Goals. </p>
<p>Tracking our goals is key to making things happen! Words have power and writing those down, even more. </p>
<p>_________________________________</p>
<p>There is no need to overwhelm yourself with trying to map out the whole year if it doesn't work for you. If it does, awesome, and that's not to say there isn't a space to write your yearly goals in the first Quarter Planner of the 2020 Modern Woman Planner. </p> <h3>What I am creating: </h3>
<p>Quarterly 2020 Modern Woman Planner.</p>
<p>It's a physical 6 X 9  saddle-stitched book. </p>
<p>52 pages printed in black &amp; white. </p>
<p>16pt C2S with a full color printed cover. </p>
<p>That means I will create four versions: </p>
<p>Jan-March</p>
<p>April-June</p>
<p>July-September</p>
<p>October-December</p>
<p>I've hired an experienced planner designer to help me carry out this project and make sure the printing is carried out correctly. </p>
<p>We have focused on the first quarter planner and will print out 50 copies of those the prototype. </p> <h3>The Idea: </h3>
<p>An easy to carry 6 X 9 stitched quarterly planner. </p>
<p>I wanted to create a planner for a long time but before I ventured into creating a ""book,"" I embarked on creating a version that people could download from my website. </p>
<p>What the other planners are lacking that my planner has:</p>
<p>No room to write down the yearly goals.</p>
<p>No tracking system</p>
<p>Too big and heavy! </p>
<p>Too many pages for categories no one cares to use. </p>
<p>The weeks start on Monday and the weekends are towards the end of the weekly page.</p>
<p>The month view of the planner also starts on Monday. </p> <h3>How I started: </h3>
<p>A Month-to-Month download:</p>
<p>With the help of a designer friend, I was able to create the first pages that were to go out as a free download.</p>
<p>Every month, I would email those on my mailing list, the monthly planner so that they could keep track of their goals, month to month and also weekly.</p>
<p>After receiving great compliments on them and hearing how using the sheets helped them complete projects and stay on track of all their to-do's I was inspired to keep going.</p>
<p>Then I created a Quarterly Planner for download. </p>
<p>I self-funded the creation of Quarterly Planners that would also be available as a download.</p>
<p>Some people would download the sheets and enter them into a spiral notebook to keep them in place! </p>
<p>I knew I had to create one that women could carry around and not have to go to a store to find a notebook or folder to place them in. </p>
<h3><strong>Where we are now:</strong></h3>
<p>I decided to hire a designer that has experience creating planners. </p>
<p>She's already created a cover page &amp; back page.</p>
<p>The beautiful salmon/peachy color has been selected.</p>
<p>And my current Mastermind group has been using and loving the January version of the planner. </p>
<p>One of the best parts about this planner is that it's a quarter of the year.</p>
<p>Meaning, the first round will be January-March.</p>
<p>This really helps to get clearer on the goals at hand and focus on the year from quarter to quarter.</p>
<p>I need your help to see this through.</p>
<h3><strong>What I need: </strong></h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise $2,500.</p>
<p>I'm self-funding the project and I have been doing so and providing the download version of the first drafts of the planners.</p>
<p>This allowed me to test the product before a full investment. </p>
<p>I've self-funded $1,700 so far (not including creating the first versions that would go out monthly to the email list) of the $4,700 total.</p>
<p>This would ensure the design of the Modern Woman Planner and I can tweak the rest of the years as they come along. </p>
<p><i><strong>Reaching my goal won't only help me make my first product a reality, I will show other entrepreneurs how they can also make their products a reality. </strong></i></p>
<h3><strong>What you get with perks:</strong></h3>
<p>With a $25 perk, or more you get a copy of the printed First Quarter Planner (includes shipping). </p>
<p>With a $5 perk, you get a digital download of the January Planner &amp; a very big thanks from me and Joey (the cutie Cat, my assistant). </p>
<p>For a $100 perk, you get the four Quarter planners as they are printed.  Updates will be posted on the page. </p>
<h3><strong>What if I want to help and I don’t want a planner?</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>I just want to contribute: </strong></h3>
<p>Donations on any amount are possible. Anywhere from $1 to ….</p>
<h3><strong>Launch Party!</strong></h3>
<p><b>I can't wait to thank you in person at the soft launch party! Save the Date: February 29th. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges:</strong></h3>
<p>I'm a one-woman show, but if you know anything about me, I make it happen. </p>
<p>The biggest risk is that the first planner will not be ready by February 1. January has sailed but getting this out in February is better than nothing at all. </p>
<p>To help this issue, everyone that donates will get the January download version of the planner. </p>
<p>The color of the planner may be slightly different than that shown on the screen. </p>
<h3><strong>If I am missing any info, please let me know!</strong></h3>
</div></div>","""I love this planner, it's like five planners I am currently using in one.""  
This is the best thing I've heard about the January PDF version of the planner.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Introduce yourself and your background. My name is Kira Rae, and I am a 17 year old girl from Germantown Tennessee. For years, I have been writing, whether it be short stories or novels, and recently I started writing screenplays and started an interest in acting. With a family as supportive as mine, I was able to pursue what I wanted which is where I ran into my problem. Getting known in the film industry is one of the toughest tasks in the world because it's all about connections, all about who you know. What happens when you don't know anyone? Without contacts, it's near impossible to get parts or become known for whatever you want to do, acting, directing, writing, etc. And it isn't because of a lack of talent rather than a lack of representation. As someone who was always told that they had a gift, this got me thinking. Getting exposed and becoming famous was all about luck, and what if we could somehow increase this luck? With these thoughts, I was able to create Torify. Torify is a streaming service that is different than any other streaming services out there. Torify would only show its Torify Originals, meaning that it would be completely exclusive in its contents. What makes it stand out? The fact that we use the community to build upon. Our writers, directors, actors, will all be people who have had the same thoughts and feelings as me. 'I have a gift, but how can I show everyone else?' Torify's platform hires those who haven't had their break through, no previous experience necessary. For actors, if you fit a physical description, you are guaranteed to receive an online submission, and if we approve that then you get brought in for the audition. With actors, we would have workshops yearly, around the country, to work with others and help them to star in Torify originals and move on from that to bigger and better things. For writers, we offer feedback yearly to help them improve. We also would allow for independent films to be uploaded onto Torify, after supervision and look over, giving independent creators a chance to show their work. And Torify doesn't stop there. Another unique aspect would be the fact that it offers 'recommendations', a category where our users can submit in their requests for comics or books that they'd like to see adapted. While we cannot adapt everything, the most popular things we can, making Torify something for everybody. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With a hopeful, full release date by November 18, 2020, Torify has some work that needs to be done to make this concept into a reality. We are looking to raise $1 Million dollars to really get this show on the road. This money is being divided into the web design fees to give customers the best experience that we possible can. We are also looking to relocate Torify to the heart of the entertainment industry, Los Angeles, California. With the money we raise, we are also going to start sponsoring ads and getting our name out there as well as beginning to look into the purchase of rights to make adaptations of popular books and comics. But, Torify plans on giving back as well. As we grow, every time a milestone is hit, we plan on doing sponsored giveaways as we celebrate the success in which we grow. We know Torify can become something huge, with your help. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Like any other business, Torify has risks. Our biggest risk is the lack of exposure. Without people hearing about us, we won't be able to reach the predicted milestones which is why we are really making a push towards sponsoring and getting our names out there. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Do you want to help us? Then feel free to just share the name of Torify! Mention us on your youtube or TikTok and link us! We would appreciate that!

<p>Language learning, understood in modern terms, is something relatively new, something whose potential we have only grasped with globalisation and the arrival of the Internet. However, while the field of language learning is dominated by big companies, it is now time to give language learners the freedom they deserve; a freedom to choose when, where, how and with whom to learn a language. And that, exactly, is uTandem.</p><br/><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">uTandem is a free mobile app which connects you with the people around you to learn your favourite language by doing language exchange. It gets you in touch with other language learners around you, sorted by distance, and shows you the languages they speak and the ones they want to practise. When you have found a suitable partner, you can start chatting and then arrange a place to meet and carry out your exchange session. </span><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://utandem.com/empresas/images/imagne-3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Apart from connecting you with other users, uTandem provides you with a list of places where you can meet up (cafés, bars, pubs, etc.), where you can learn languages with professionals (academies, language schools, etc.) and where you can find other language learners and resources (language exchange groups, language blogs, etc.). All of this in just one sleek app. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://utandem.com/empresas/images/imagne-4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>uTandem makes language learning easy, fun and practical. </p>
<br/><p></p><p></p><p><b>Who is behind uTandem?</b></p>
<p>uTandem is being developed by a team of 6 Spanish youngsters, between the ages of 20 and 30, with diverse educational backgrounds. We are all young, down-to-earth and hard-working and we are going to great lengths to see our dream come true. </p>
<p>We have been working together for over 18 months and we would love to be able to provide uTandem with all the improvements and functionality that language learners dream of. However, this will not be possible without your help. </p>
<p>We believe in our project and we would love you to be a part of it. </p><p><br/>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://utandem.com/empresas/images/somos.gif"" src="""" style=""""/>  </p><p></p><p><b>How will the funds be invested?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you like what you’ve
read so far? Good! Because uTandem already exists. We would love you to
download the app for free and check it out for yourself. </p>
<p>So what’s this campaign
for? Well, we want to go further by improving and expanding all our services so
that uTandem becomes an essential language learning tool. Also, we want our
users’ experience to go beyond the screen of their device. </p><p>
</p><p>Since
we started, we have been listening to our more than 40,000 users and many other
language learners out there, and we have noted down all the changes and
improvements that people would love to see us implement. For this reason, thanks
to their feedback and our determination to improve, we are starting this
campaign. Whatever funds we raise will be invested in the following: </p><p>
</p><p>A. Expanding our app and web services:</p>
<p>•Chat
improvements to provide a communicative experience more in accordance with the
latest trends.</p>

<br/><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p><br/></div>","Why uTandem?
Language learning, understood in modern terms, is something relatively new, something whose potential we have only grasped with globalisation and the arrival of the Internet. However, while the field of language learning is dominated by big companies, it is now time to give language learners the freedom they deserve; a freedom to choose when, where, how and with whom to learn a language. And that, exactly, is uTandem.uTandem is a free mobile app which connects you with the people around you to learn your favourite language by doing language exchange. It gets you in touch with other language learners around you, sorted by distance, and shows you the languages they speak and the ones they want to practise. When you have found a suitable partner, you can start chatting and then arrange a place to meet and carry out your exchange session. 

Apart from connecting you with other users, uTandem provides you with a list of places where you can meet up (cafés, bars, pubs, etc.), where you can learn languages with professionals (academies, language schools, etc.) and where you can find other language learners and resources (language exchange groups, language blogs, etc.). All of this in just one sleek app. 



uTandem makes language learning easy, fun and practical. 
Who is behind uTandem?
uTandem is being developed by a team of 6 Spanish youngsters, between the ages of 20 and 30, with diverse educational backgrounds. We are all young, down-to-earth and hard-working and we are going to great lengths to see our dream come true. 
We have been working together for over 18 months and we would love to be able to provide uTandem with all the improvements and functionality that language learners dream of. However, this will not be possible without your help. 
We believe in our project and we would love you to be a part of it. 
  How will the funds be invested?

Do you like what you’ve
read so far? Good! Because uTandem already exists. We would love you to
download the app for free and check it out for yourself. 
So what’s this campaign
for? Well, we want to go further by improving and expanding all our services so
that uTandem becomes an essential language learning tool. Also, we want our
users’ experience to go beyond the screen of their device. 
Since
we started, we have been listening to our more than 40,000 users and many other
language learners out there, and we have noted down all the changes and
improvements that people would love to see us implement. For this reason, thanks

<p>The Team at Mclowd have spent the last seven years building a unique SMSF Community that has been founded on the participation of over 4,000 self-funded retirees. </p>
<p>Our achievements to date include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing access to a free version of our cloud-based accounting software</li>
<li>Alongside a marketplace where Trustees can purchase related services at competitive prices</li>

<p>Over that period the development process has been a collaborative exercise involving:</p>

</div>
<p>Muuver is a simple to use social app that let's you share your hypes and gripes, kudos &amp; complaints, likes, and dislikes - about ANYTHING.</p>
<p>Muuver then takes your hype or gripe about an item and adds it to the ""ITEM PAGE"" where you can see everybody else's posts who hyped or griped about that item.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 20px; color: #f97218; font-weight: bold;"">The ITEM PAGE</h3>
<p><strong>This ITEM PAGE is where the power is.</strong></p>
<p>Not only does it show everyone's post about that item, it also shows; an overall +/- score for the item, let's you ""watch"" or follow the item, it displays the item's popularity on muuver, shows total posts, total number of 'voters', and lots more that we'll be revealing soon.</p>
<p>Just imagine - the ITEM PAGE is also the place where companies will have to publicly respond to our user's hypes and gripes, in full transparency. You'll get to see how companies handle both positive and negative issues.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 20px; color: #f97218; font-weight: bold;"">MUUVMENTS</h3>
<p><strong>the POWER TO THE PEOPLE tool</strong></p>
<p>We call it ""the POWER TO THE PEOPLE tool"" because muuver effortlessly connects people who have common goals and interests about any topic to band together to forward their cause or interest using our online tools for action.</p>
<p>We call this suite of tools a ""muuvment"".  ~""Because when a group of people who collectively like or dislike something all join together, it inherently creates a muuvment.""</p>
<p><strong>MUUVMENTS have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>public, semi-private, and fully private member options</li>
<li>event management system and group calendar to help organize your muuvment</li>
<li>online petitions and petition managment system</li>
<li>fully functional self-managing forums</li>
<li>group post feeds (like the main muuver feed but restricted the muuvment only - or public if you want it)</li>
<li>lots more we can't tell you about just yet. ;)</li>
</ul><p>But that's not even all of it! Read on to see how simply sharing your hypes and gripes can create change.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 26px; color: #f97218; font-weight: bold;"">Here's How It Works:</h3>
<p>It's very simple - it's like using Facebook and Twitter together, but instead of hashtag, you use a ""<strong>muuvtag</strong>"".</p>
<p>You do that by putting a ""<strong>+</strong>"" (plus) sign in front of something you like, or a ""<strong>-</strong>"" (minus) sign in front of something you dislike.</p>
<p>You close multiple words in a tag by putting a ""<strong>+</strong>"" or ""<strong>-</strong>"" at the end of the words. (See image below.)</p>
<center><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.muuver.com/wp-content/uploads/indiegogo_screenshots_muuver_feed1.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<h3 style=""font-size: 26px; color: #f97218; font-weight: bold;"">Use the Tool to Build the Tool</h3>
<p>Since muuver is a capable of having each of it's participants give their opinion about any topic, it's like an instant ""mini-democracy"" allowing you to get immediate feedback from participants about any issue or item. Therefore, we're going to create a ""muuver issues"" muuvment that will allow our users to have direct input into how the tool gets build and evolves.</p>
<p><strong>Help Build Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>For example, one of the first issues/items that we'll be posting is our Privacy Policy discussion. We want users to have a direct sya in the evolution and development of our privacy policy. Kinda neat, eh? Not many other sites will do that with you, if any.</p>

</h1></div>","What is ""muuver""?

See our founder's interview on Forbes

Muuver is a simple to use social app that let's you share your hypes and gripes, kudos & complaints, likes, and dislikes - about ANYTHING.
Muuver then takes your hype or gripe about an item and adds it to the ""ITEM PAGE"" where you can see everybody else's posts who hyped or griped about that item.
The ITEM PAGE
This ITEM PAGE is where the power is.
Not only does it show everyone's post about that item, it also shows; an overall +/- score for the item, let's you ""watch"" or follow the item, it displays the item's popularity on muuver, shows total posts, total number of 'voters', and lots more that we'll be revealing soon.
Just imagine - the ITEM PAGE is also the place where companies will have to publicly respond to our user's hypes and gripes, in full transparency. You'll get to see how companies handle both positive and negative issues.
MUUVMENTS
the POWER TO THE PEOPLE tool
We call it ""the POWER TO THE PEOPLE tool"" because muuver effortlessly connects people who have common goals and interests about any topic to band together to forward their cause or interest using our online tools for action.
We call this suite of tools a ""muuvment"".  ~""Because when a group of people who collectively like or dislike something all join together, it inherently creates a muuvment.""
MUUVMENTS have:

public, semi-private, and fully private member options
event management system and group calendar to help organize your muuvment
online petitions and petition managment system
fully functional self-managing forums
group post feeds (like the main muuver feed but restricted the muuvment only - or public if you want it)
lots more we can't tell you about just yet. ;)
But that's not even all of it! Read on to see how simply sharing your hypes and gripes can create change.
Here's How It Works:
It's very simple - it's like using Facebook and Twitter together, but instead of hashtag, you use a ""muuvtag"".
You do that by putting a ""+"" (plus) sign in front of something you like, or a ""-"" (minus) sign in front of something you dislike.
You close multiple words in a tag by putting a ""+"" or ""-"" at the end of the words. (See image below.)

Use the Tool to Build the Tool
Since muuver is a capable of having each of it's participants give their opinion about any topic, it's like an instant ""mini-democracy"" allowing you to get immediate feedback from participants about any issue or item. Therefore, we're going to create a ""muuver issues"" muuvment that will allow our users to have direct input into how the tool gets build and evolves.
Help Build Our Privacy Policy
For example, one of the first issues/items that we'll be posting is our Privacy Policy discussion. We want users to have a direct sya in the evolution and development of our privacy policy. Kinda neat, eh? Not many other sites will do that with you, if any.

<p>At the moment, the PGH agency will offer through its <a href=""http://personalgolfresidences.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first site</a> houses to rent in Thailand, in Bali and in Sri Lanka.

<p>You probably noticed that the persons you meet during your business trips or during working sessions like exchanging their business cards ?</p>
<p>But one of the minor problems during these exchanges is that your business cards will be very often ill-treated, slipped with little care in pockets, and even some people use them as common piece of paper to write things, or worse,  they have fun with twiddling them while discussing with you!</p>
<p>And a few weeks later, even if your cards are very beautiful, they will be thrown in the trash, because the people forgot you, they don’t remember about your product anymore, or don’t even remember how they met you.</p>
<p>Conversely, you cannot keep all of them in bulky files!</p>
<p>Your cards are also useful for your friends to your representatives , according to the sector of activity you are working in : “well, here is the card of my mate Jacques, you will see, he’s a fantastic dentist!</p>
<p>The business cards are in the real estate, in the sale and in tourism business in general exchanged daily with new knowledge, new customers, or just in case ....</p>
<p>The hotels working with the PGH agency use thousands of cards every week, so that their clients can show them to passers-by to ask where they are as to the location of their hotel or to a taxi to come back at the end of the evening.</p>
<p>After having spent your week in that hotel, the screwed up card will be thrown in the trash, won’t it ?</p>

<p>Through the attempt to create a policy of zero paper within the company and, although we are aware that it will be difficult, you have to start from somewhere, dont you?</p>
<p>The PGH agency is gradually trying hard to find solutions at all levels to reduce its consumption of paper!</p>
<p>At the time when everybody uses smartphones, the idea to create an application to eradicate paper business cards, to make Virtual Business Cards, naturally occurred.</p>
<h2>The problem that the PGH agency wants to solve is the eradication of the paper business cards!</h2>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/595445WhyDidYouLaunchedanIndiegogocampaignLarge.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The first reason</strong></p>
<p>The founding of a company is expensive in Switzerland and the web site for the renting of golf villas costs a lot and unfortunately at the moment the PGH agency has not enough liquidity to create the application alone, and more particularly for the three kinds of programming for the Iphone, Android and Windows mobiles to satisfy as many clients as possible.</p>
<p>Is one of the reasons why the PGH agency thought about crowd funding to ask you to become one of the partners who will make the future or who stop the adventure?</p>
<p>It is important for us not to print business cards anymore and as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>The second reason</strong></p>
<p>When you are deeply involved in your creations, you cannot step back as regards alterations before marketing the application! If you become a preferred partner, you will have access to the tests and you will be able to give your positive and negative impressions concerning the application to make it final!</p>
<p><strong>The third reason</strong></p>
<p>To have an application different from the others through its interactions, through its design, through its effective options, everything requires serious efforts in design, knowledge and finance. Your help will enable us to rehire a company we have already worked with, which is performing a great job. It is at the moment on its starting block for the kick start.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/139202Whydoyouaskustohelpyou.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>An Indiegogo campaign does not only consist in raising funds to accelerate a project, it is also to share with you and have the feeling that you entered a team, where your ideas will be listened to and taken into consideration. You can have some ideas that the designing team didn’t think about or which were pushed aside for various reasons, but which could be very useful for you!</p>
<p>That application is for everyone, and that is why the PGH agency has decided to create at the same time, if it is possible, the application for all the formats available at present - iphone, Android and Windows Phone. We hope that it will be a source of imagination, inspiration to reduce the use of the papers that we do not have necessarily the use today anymore.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/689393ThemoneyyouinvestwillbespentinthefollowingpointsLarge.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Crowd funding represents an unbelievable opportunity to create a project and to achieve it, but unfortunately numerous projects are not enough funded to come true!</p>
<p>That is why we have decided to review our strategy and to ask just part of the budget to start the project and we also wish to finance the remaining part of the project through the sale of the app, if we cannot balance the budget to achieve the whole project!</p>
<p>The budget for the project amounts to $16,240 but, to start and supply the application for the Iphone and for the first version of the web site, we need $7,700.</p>
<p>If the donations exceed $7,700, they will be used to create the applications for the other supports, such as for the Androïd and Windows phones, and to get the web site with all the options we intend to offer you. The final budget also includes a bigger share for the communication and the marketing of the project.</p>
<p>Here are the main points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehiring of the company we have already worked with on our websites</li>
<li>Creation of the final visual identity of the application and of the website</li>
<li>Creation, as a first step and following the donations of the donors, of the application for Iphones, then for the Android and finally for the Windows phone.</li>
<li>Creation of the website, creation of the various modules, such as the one which will allow you to create your cards easily, for the persons who don’t master the complex creator software , the module for the creation, the alteration and the customization of the card into the QR code, etc…</li>
<li>Renting of the server, domain name, etc…</li>
<li>Support of the application following its launching</li>
<li>To create and to lead a successful marketing campaign</li>
<li>Advertising</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/367662WhyUs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The PGH agency is a company which completes its projects and which always comes back to what has been created to gradually improve it to be close to perfection! The quality can be found in the details that gives a perfect result!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/343436ThemostIMPORTANTwhatdoyoureceiveinhelpingusLarge.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The team has thought a long time about it and found it disrespectful to ask you for money for that project and to use your money to offer you a t-shirt or an object that you would have indirectly paid through your donation and worse to ask you $10 for the shipping costs of the parcel.</p>
<p>Isn’t better to sponsor the project for an additional $10 and to have an upgrade option of gift?</p>
<p>The team has therefore decided to offer you some packages of the application and discounts on the creation of your animated cards if you of course decide to use the services offered on the future site of the app.</p>
<h3><b>Consequently, The descriptions Below are what we offer you to receive in exchange of your donation due to the lack of space in the column of the compensations!</b></h3>

<br/><p></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/307519Getinvolved.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To achieve that project, the PGH agency does not only need your financial help to create the VBC application, the whole team also needs your support and your help to quickly make it known to as many people as possible!</p>
<p>So, if you can help us with an investment in the project to become our project and start that adventure together, that would be fantastic, wouldn’t it ?</p>
<p>Meet your friends on Facebook, Twitter and on the other social networks, on your website, your blogs, newsletters or have the Virtual Business Card tattooed on your forehead! so that we can create a small army to protect our trees and fight over-consumption of paper business cards.</p>
<p>Just have a glance at this <a href=""http://www.planetoscope.com/developpement-durable/papier"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> the figures of our over-consumption are quite impressive !</p>
<p>The PGH agency will assess all the opportunities of advertising for the Indiegogo campaign that you can suggest to make that excellent application known</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/614598Ourfirstthanks.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The whole team of Personal Golf Holidays thank you in advance for your donation and for the publicity you will make for that Indiegogo campaign.</p>

<p><span>Avec votre aide, cette application changera à jamais la façon que vous échangez vos cartes de visite!</span></p>
<p><span>Vous allez contribuer à votre niveau à la protection de la nature, mais le résultat sera multiplié par le nombre de personnes qui utiliseront l’App! Egalement vous contribuerez à utiliser moins d'encres pour les impressions sur papier et carton!</span></p>

<p>Nous sommes une jeune et petite agence de locations de biens immobiliers basée en Suisse Romande nommée PGH.Sàrl ( Personal Golf Holidays ) et Personal Golf Holidays Part., Ltd en Thaïlande spécialisée dans les séjours golfiques à la carte en Asie.</p>
<p>Pour le moment, la PGH proposera par le biais de son <a href=""http://personalgolfresidences.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">premier site</a> des maisons à louer en Thaïlande, à Bali et au Sri Lanka. Et bientôt sur le deuxième site les parcours de golf et toutes les activités culturelles disponibles dans les régions où les clients peuvent séjourner.</p>
<p><span>La PGH tente d’introduire dans l’entreprise la politique du zéro papier afin de contribuer à son niveau à la protection de notre mère la Terre.</span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img11.hostingpics.net/pics/694118Leproblmequenousvoulonsrsoudre.png"" src="""" style=""""/>Vous vous êtes peut-être rendus compte que les personnes que vous rencontrez lors de vos déplacements de travail ou pendant vos séances professionnelles aiment échanger leurs cartes de visite?</p>
<p><span>Mais un des petits problèmes lors de ces échanges est que vos cartes de visite seront le plus souvent maltraitées, rangées avec peu de soins dans une poche, ou certaines personnes les utilisent comme un vulgaire bout de papier à notes ou pire ils s’amusent à les tortiller pendant que vous discutez avec eux!</span></p>
<p>Et après quelques semaines, vos cartes bien que certainement très belles partent à la poubelle, car les personnes vous ont oubliés, ne se souviennent plus de votre produit, ou ne se rappellent plus comment ils vous ont rencontrés, d’ailleurs vous ne pouvez pas non plus toutes les garder dans des classeurs qui prennent de la place!</p>
<p><span>Vos cartes servent également à vos amis suivant le domaine que vous exercez à être vos ambassadeurs : Tiens voilà la carte de mon pote Jacques, tu verras c’est un super dentiste! </span></p>
<p><span>Les cartes sont dans la location de biens immobiliers, de la vente et dans le tourisme en général un échange de tous les jours avec de nouvelles connaissances, de nouveaux clients, ou simplement au cas ou....</span></p>
<p><span>Les hôtels avec lesquelles la PGH travaille utilisent des milliers de cartes visite par semaine, pour que leurs clients puissent la montrer à des passants pour leur demander où ils se trouvent par rapport à leurs hôtels et à un taxi pour pouvoir s’y rendre en fin de soirée.</span></p>
<p><span>Après avoir passé votre semaine dans cet hôtel, la carte de visite toute froissée finira certainement à la poubelle, non?!?</span></p>

<p>Petit à petit la PGH s’est efforcée et s’efforce à trouver des solutions à tous les niveaux pour diminuer sa consommation de papier!</p>
<p>A l’heure où tout le monde utilise des smartphones, l’idée de créer une application pour éradiquer les cartes de visite en papier en les transformant en  Virtual Business Card, est naturellement apparu.</p>

<p>Une campagne Indiegogo n’est pas seulement le fait de lever des fonds pour avancer un projet plus vite, c’est également pour pouvoir partager avec vous et vous faire sentir que vous êtes entré dans un team, où vos idées seront écoutées et prises en compte. Vous pouvez avoir des idées auxquelles l’équipe de conception n’a pas pensé ou écarté pour diverses raisons, mais qui vous serait fort utile!</p>
<p><span>Cette application est destinée à tous, c’est pour cela que la PGH a décidé de faire en même temps (si possible) l’application pour tous les formats actuellement disponibles ( iPhone, Androïd et Windows Phone ). Nous espérons qu’elle sera une source d’imagination, d’inspiration afin de réduire l’utilisation des papiers dont on'a plus forcément besoin de nos jours!</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>La première raison                                                                                                                    </strong></span>La création d’une entreprise coûte cher en Suisse et le site internet pour la location de villas de golf a financièrement fait mal, et hélas pour le moment la PGH n’a pas assez d’argent pour créer l’application toute seule et surtout pour les 3 différents types de programmation pour iPhone, Androïd, Windows Mobile pour satisfaire le maximum de personnes, c’est une des raisons qui a fait que la PGH a pensé au Crouwdfunding pour vous demander de devenir un des partenaires qui fera l’avenir ou l’arrêt de cette aventure.</span></p>
<p><span>Il est important pour nous de ne plus imprimer de cartes de visite le plus rapidement possible.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>La deuxième raison</strong>                                                                                                            </span>Quand on a le nez dans ses créations, on ne peut avoir un bon recul pour ce qui doit être changé avant la commercialisation de l’application! En devenant un partenaire privilégié de cette aventure, vous aurez l’accès aux tests, et vous pourrez donner vos impressions positives ou négatives de l’application afin de la rentre ultime!</p>
<p><span><strong>La troisième raison                                                                                                                   </strong></span>Pour avoir l’application qui se démarque des autres par ses interactions, par son design,  par ses options performantes, tout cela demande de gros efforts de conception, de connaissances et financiers.

<p><span>C’est pour cela que nous avons décidé de revoir notre stratégie et de demander seulement une partie du budget afin de pouvoir commencer et nous espérons aussi pouvoir sponsoriser le reste par le biais de la vente de l’app, si nous ne parvenons pas au budget pour tout faire d’un coup!</span></p>
<p><span>Le budget du projet est de $ </span>16’240, mais pour démarrer et fournir l’application pour iPhone et une première version du site internet nous avons besoin de $ 7700.</p>
<p><span>Si les donations arrivent à dépasser les $ 7700, elles serviront à créer les applications pour les autres supports tels que pour Androïd et pour Windows phone. ainsi qu’avoir le site internet avec toutes les options que nous désirons vous offrir. Le budget final contient également une plus grosse part pour la communication et le marketing autour du projet.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Voilà les points principaux </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ré-engagement l’entreprise avec laquelle nous avons déjà travaillé sur nos sites internet.</span></li>
<li><span>Création de l’identité visuelle finale de l’application et du site internet.</span></li>
<li><span>Création dans un premier temps et suivant la participation des donateurs, la création de l’application pour Iphone, puis Androïd et pour finir Windows phone.</span></li>
<li>
<span><span>Création du site internet, création des divers modules tels que celui qui vous permettra la création de vos cartes facilement pour les personnes ne maîtrisant pas les logiciels de création complexes, le module pour la création, la transformation et la personnalisation</span></span><span> de sa carte en QrCode, etc...</span>
</li>
<li><span>Location de serveur, nom de domaine, etc...</span></li>

With your help, that application will change forever the way you exchange your business cards!
You will contribute at your level to the protection of the nature, but the result will be multiplied by the number of people using the app!
You will also contribute to the decrease in the use of inks to print paper and cardboard.

We are a young and small agency specialized in the renting of property, whose head office is based in Western Switzerland, and called PGH.Sàrl ( Personal Golf Holidays ) and Personal Golf Holidays Part Ltd in Thailand , specialized in the tailor-made golf breaks in Asia.
At the moment, the PGH agency will offer through its first site houses to rent in Thailand, in Bali and in Sri Lanka. And soon the second site will offer golf courses and all the cultural activities available in the areas where the clients can stay.
The PGH agency is trying to introduce the zero paper policy to contribute at its level to the protection of our mother the earth.

You probably noticed that the persons you meet during your business trips or during working sessions like exchanging their business cards ?
But one of the minor problems during these exchanges is that your business cards will be very often ill-treated, slipped with little care in pockets, and even some people use them as common piece of paper to write things, or worse,  they have fun with twiddling them while discussing with you!
And a few weeks later, even if your cards are very beautiful, they will be thrown in the trash, because the people forgot you, they don’t remember about your product anymore, or don’t even remember how they met you.
Conversely, you cannot keep all of them in bulky files!
Your cards are also useful for your friends to your representatives , according to the sector of activity you are working in : “well, here is the card of my mate Jacques, you will see, he’s a fantastic dentist!
The business cards are in the real estate, in the sale and in tourism business in general exchanged daily with new knowledge, new customers, or just in case ....
The hotels working with the PGH agency use thousands of cards every week, so that their clients can show them to passers-by to ask where they are as to the location of their hotel or to a taxi to come back at the end of the evening.
After having spent your week in that hotel, the screwed up card will be thrown in the trash, won’t it ?

Through the attempt to create a policy of zero paper within the company and, although we are aware that it will be difficult, you have to start from somewhere, dont you?
The PGH agency is gradually trying hard to find solutions at all levels to reduce its consumption of paper!
At the time when everybody uses smartphones, the idea to create an application to eradicate paper business cards, to make Virtual Business Cards, naturally occurred.
The problem that the PGH agency wants to solve is the eradication of the paper business cards!


Your annual manufacturing cost will be sharply reduced!
You will protect the nature at the height of your card consumption.
If you don’t have any card at the moment, you will be able to create easily your card on the site of the application, simply and quickly.
If you already own the files of your designer, you will just have to follow the implementation guide of the design and, off you go, your business card will be ready in no time, cool, isn’t it?
Instead of having an extra case in your pocket to store your cards, all of them will be accessible in your smartphone and saved on a server. You will lose no more contacts!
You will be able to transmit to whoever and whenever you want the card of Jacques with just a few clicks only!
You will be able to send your card quickly together with your mails, Wi Fi, etc…
You will be able to collect and transmit your card quickly with your personal QR code.
If you need to have an update, your contacts will be directly warned and you will have no more the need to send 100 mails, SMS, 4 extensions on your Facebook wall, etc… to inform them about your new address or other life changes.
The people to whom you will have transmitted your card won’t forget you anymore!
They will always know the owner of the card, thanks to your profile picture, the pictures of your services and of the picture your company wants to convey through the design of your card.
If you work with other countries, such as China or Thailand, etc… you will be able to create your cards with their alphabets!
You will never ask the question anymore to know if you need a business card for your family, because its creation is free! So take advantage of it! And there are many other nice options to discover in the Virtual Business Card App!


Exchange between the application and your card

Through Bluetooth, mails and by customizable QR code.

Contact

An update following each alteration of your card will be sent to all your contacts with an alert or not.
The selection of your contacts will be done through the choice of :
Their pictures
Cities
Countries
By Their logos
By Company names
By Company type
Job, CEO, stores clerk, designer, etc…
By Key words
You will lose no more contacts because they will be stored on a server
You will able to directly click on the address to be directed to your client and following the information of the GPS.

Your VBC will have the design you wish to give

Your company design
A picture of your family
Of your sporting activity team
The last drawing of your daughter
Your imagination will be the limit!
The creation of animation for your business cards!

Various formats will be accepted for your VBC

For the standard cards, the GIF format will be used
The HTML 5 format will enable you to have breathtaking animation for your competitors

The creation will be done easily

On the application site, you will be able to create yourself your cards with a drag and drop system
Your designer or the designers of the Seven Blue Clouds Studio team will be able to create the design you are dreaming of!
Just upload the cards already created

Agenda

The calendar option will enable you to use it as an agenda open to all so that all the people can arrange for meetings with you according to the free appointments without bothering you and for you to answer positively or negatively to that request.

That option will of course be customizable to be visible or not and your contacts will be of course hidden

You will be able to block your holiday periods, sports sessions, working sessions so that nobody disturbs you during these privileged moments.

Advertising & socialization
(According to the funding)

You will also be able to show pictures of your latest products or of your business, such as the pictures of your restaurant, regular update of your meal of the day, etc…
Updates for restaurant owners, for menus, the price of hotel rooms, etc… will be optional as not to disturb you! 


The first reason
The founding of a company is expensive in Switzerland and the web site for the renting of golf villas costs a lot and unfortunately at the moment the PGH agency has not enough liquidity to create the application alone, and more particularly for the three kinds of programming for the Iphone, Android and Windows mobiles to satisfy as many clients as possible.
Is one of the reasons why the PGH agency thought about crowd funding to ask you to become one of the partners who will make the future or who stop the adventure?
It is important for us not to print business cards anymore and as soon as possible.
The second reason
When you are deeply involved in your creations, you cannot step back as regards alterations before marketing the application! If you become a preferred partner, you will have access to the tests and you will be able to give your positive and negative impressions concerning the application to make it final!
The third reason
To have an application different from the others through its interactions, through its design, through its effective options, everything requires serious efforts in design, knowledge and finance. Your help will enable us to rehire a company we have already worked with, which is performing a great job. It is at the moment on its starting block for the kick start.

An Indiegogo campaign does not only consist in raising funds to accelerate a project, it is also to share with you and have the feeling that you entered a team, where your ideas will be listened to and taken into consideration. You can have some ideas that the designing team didn’t think about or which were pushed aside for various reasons, but which could be very useful for you!
That application is for everyone, and that is why the PGH agency has decided to create at the same time, if it is possible, the application for all the formats available at present - iphone, Android and Windows Phone. We hope that it will be a source of imagination, inspiration to reduce the use of the papers that we do not have necessarily the use today anymore.

Crowd funding represents an unbelievable opportunity to create a project and to achieve it, but unfortunately numerous projects are not enough funded to come true!
That is why we have decided to review our strategy and to ask just part of the budget to start the project and we also wish to finance the remaining part of the project through the sale of the app, if we cannot balance the budget to achieve the whole project!
The budget for the project amounts to $16,240 but, to start and supply the application for the Iphone and for the first version of the web site, we need $7,700.
If the donations exceed $7,700, they will be used to create the applications for the other supports, such as for the Androïd and Windows phones, and to get the web site with all the options we intend to offer you. The final budget also includes a bigger share for the communication and the marketing of the project.
Here are the main points:

Rehiring of the company we have already worked with on our websites
Creation of the final visual identity of the application and of the website
Creation, as a first step and following the donations of the donors, of the application for Iphones, then for the Android and finally for the Windows phone.
Creation of the website, creation of the various modules, such as the one which will allow you to create your cards easily, for the persons who don’t master the complex creator software , the module for the creation, the alteration and the customization of the card into the QR code, etc…
Renting of the server, domain name, etc…
Support of the application following its launching
To create and to lead a successful marketing campaign
Advertising


The PGH agency is a company which completes its projects and which always comes back to what has been created to gradually improve it to be close to perfection! The quality can be found in the details that gives a perfect result!

The team has thought a long time about it and found it disrespectful to ask you for money for that project and to use your money to offer you a t-shirt or an object that you would have indirectly paid through your donation and worse to ask you $10 for the shipping costs of the parcel.
Isn’t better to sponsor the project for an additional $10 and to have an upgrade option of gift?
The team has therefore decided to offer you some packages of the application and discounts on the creation of your animated cards if you of course decide to use the services offered on the future site of the app.
Consequently, The descriptions Below are what we offer you to receive in exchange of your donation due to the lack of space in the column of the compensations!




To achieve that project, the PGH agency does not only need your financial help to create the VBC application, the whole team also needs your support and your help to quickly make it known to as many people as possible!
So, if you can help us with an investment in the project to become our project and start that adventure together, that would be fantastic, wouldn’t it ?
Meet your friends on Facebook, Twitter and on the other social networks, on your website, your blogs, newsletters or have the Virtual Business Card tattooed on your forehead! so that we can create a small army to protect our trees and fight over-consumption of paper business cards.
Just have a glance at this website the figures of our over-consumption are quite impressive !
The PGH agency will assess all the opportunities of advertising for the Indiegogo campaign that you can suggest to make that excellent application known

The whole team of Personal Golf Holidays thank you in advance for your donation and for the publicity you will make for that Indiegogo campaign.
The PGH agency hopes to thank you quickly with a private message and of course the VBC application in your smartphone as soon as possible!
 

 
 
                                                         



Sauvez des arbres avec l’application The Virtual Business Card ( The VBC ).
Avec votre aide, cette application changera à jamais la façon que vous échangez vos cartes de visite!
Vous allez contribuer à votre niveau à la protection de la nature, mais le résultat sera multiplié par le nombre de personnes qui utiliseront l’App! Egalement vous contribuerez à utiliser moins d'encres pour les impressions sur papier et carton!

Nous sommes une jeune et petite agence de locations de biens immobiliers basée en Suisse Romande nommée PGH.Sàrl ( Personal Golf Holidays ) et Personal Golf Holidays Part., Ltd en Thaïlande spécialisée dans les séjours golfiques à la carte en Asie.
Pour le moment, la PGH proposera par le biais de son premier site des maisons à louer en Thaïlande, à Bali et au Sri Lanka. Et bientôt sur le deuxième site les parcours de golf et toutes les activités culturelles disponibles dans les régions où les clients peuvent séjourner.
La PGH tente d’introduire dans l’entreprise la politique du zéro papier afin de contribuer à son niveau à la protection de notre mère la Terre.
Vous vous êtes peut-être rendus compte que les personnes que vous rencontrez lors de vos déplacements de travail ou pendant vos séances professionnelles aiment échanger leurs cartes de visite?
Mais un des petits problèmes lors de ces échanges est que vos cartes de visite seront le plus souvent maltraitées, rangées avec peu de soins dans une poche, ou certaines personnes les utilisent comme un vulgaire bout de papier à notes ou pire ils s’amusent à les tortiller pendant que vous discutez avec eux!
Et après quelques semaines, vos cartes bien que certainement très belles partent à la poubelle, car les personnes vous ont oubliés, ne se souviennent plus de votre produit, ou ne se rappellent plus comment ils vous ont rencontrés, d’ailleurs vous ne pouvez pas non plus toutes les garder dans des classeurs qui prennent de la place!
Vos cartes servent également à vos amis suivant le domaine que vous exercez à être vos ambassadeurs : Tiens voilà la carte de mon pote Jacques, tu verras c’est un super dentiste! 
Les cartes sont dans la location de biens immobiliers, de la vente et dans le tourisme en général un échange de tous les jours avec de nouvelles connaissances, de nouveaux clients, ou simplement au cas ou....
Les hôtels avec lesquelles la PGH travaille utilisent des milliers de cartes visite par semaine, pour que leurs clients puissent la montrer à des passants pour leur demander où ils se trouvent par rapport à leurs hôtels et à un taxi pour pouvoir s’y rendre en fin de soirée.
Après avoir passé votre semaine dans cet hôtel, la carte de visite toute froissée finira certainement à la poubelle, non?!?
En tentant de créer une politique de zéro papier au sein de l’entreprise et bien que nous sachions que ça sera très difficile, il faut bien commencer à quelque part, non? 
Petit à petit la PGH s’est efforcée et s’efforce à trouver des solutions à tous les niveaux pour diminuer sa consommation de papier!
A l’heure où tout le monde utilise des smartphones, l’idée de créer une application pour éradiquer les cartes de visite en papier en les transformant en  Virtual Business Card, est naturellement apparu.
Le problème que la PGH désire résoudre est d'éradiquer les cartes de visite en papier!
 


Votre coût de fabrication annuel sera fortement réduit!
Vous protégerez la nature à la hauteur de vos consommations de cartes.
Si vous ne possédez actuellement pas de carte, vous pourrez créer facilement votre carte sur le site de l’application, simplement et rapidement. 
Si vous possédez déjà les fichiers de votre designer, il vous suffira de suivre le guide  d’implantation des designs et hop votre carte de visite sera prête en 2 temps 3 mouvements, cool non?
A la place d’avoir dans votre poche un étui supplémentaire pour ranger vos cartes, elles seront toutes accessibles dans votre smartphone et sauvés sur un serveur, vous ne perdrez plus jamais un contact!
Vous pourrez transmettre à n’importe qui et à tout moment la carte de Jacques en quelques clicks seulement!
Vous pourrez envoyer votre carte rapidement avec vos mails, Wi Fi, etc...
Vous pourrez collecter et transmettre votre carte rapidement avec votre QrCode personnel.
Si vous avez besoin de faire une mise à jour, vos contacts seront directement avertis vous n’aurez plus besoin d’envoyer 100 mails, sms, 4 postes sur votre mur Facebook, etc... pour les informer de votre changement d’adresse ou autres changements dans votre vie.
Les personnes à qui vous aurez transmis votre carte ne vous oublieront plus! Ils sauront toujours à qui appartient cette carte, grâce à votre photo de profil, les photos de vos services et de l’image que votre entreprise désire faire passer par le design de votre carte.
Si vous travaillez avec d’autres pays tels que la Chine, la Thaïlande, etc.. vous pourrez créer vos cartes avec leurs alphabets!
Vous ne vous poserez même plus la question de si vous avez besoin d’une carte de visite pour votre famille, car sa création est gratuite! Alors profitez en! 
Et bien d’autres options sympa à découvrir dans The Virtual Business Card App !

Vous pourrez bloquer vos zones de vacances, de sport, de séances afin que personne ne vous dérange pendant ces moments privilégiés.

Des mises à jour pour les restaurateurs, pour les menus, le prix des chambres d’hôtels, etc... seront en option afin de ne pas vous agresser.


Une campagne Indiegogo n’est pas seulement le fait de lever des fonds pour avancer un projet plus vite, c’est également pour pouvoir partager avec vous et vous faire sentir que vous êtes entré dans un team, où vos idées seront écoutées et prises en compte. Vous pouvez avoir des idées auxquelles l’équipe de conception n’a pas pensé ou écarté pour diverses raisons, mais qui vous serait fort utile!
Cette application est destinée à tous, c’est pour cela que la PGH a décidé de faire en même temps (si possible) l’application pour tous les formats actuellement disponibles ( iPhone, Androïd et Windows Phone ). Nous espérons qu’elle sera une source d’imagination, d’inspiration afin de réduire l’utilisation des papiers dont on'a plus forcément besoin de nos jours!

La première raison                                                                                                                    La création d’une entreprise coûte cher en Suisse et le site internet pour la location de villas de golf a financièrement fait mal, et hélas pour le moment la PGH n’a pas assez d’argent pour créer l’application toute seule et surtout pour les 3 différents types de programmation pour iPhone, Androïd, Windows Mobile pour satisfaire le maximum de personnes, c’est une des raisons qui a fait que la PGH a pensé au Crouwdfunding pour vous demander de devenir un des partenaires qui fera l’avenir ou l’arrêt de cette aventure.
Il est important pour nous de ne plus imprimer de cartes de visite le plus rapidement possible.
La deuxième raison                                                                                                            Quand on a le nez dans ses créations, on ne peut avoir un bon recul pour ce qui doit être changé avant la commercialisation de l’application! En devenant un partenaire privilégié de cette aventure, vous aurez l’accès aux tests, et vous pourrez donner vos impressions positives ou négatives de l’application afin de la rentre ultime!
La troisième raison                                                                                                                   Pour avoir l’application qui se démarque des autres par ses interactions, par son design,  par ses options performantes, tout cela demande de gros efforts de conception, de connaissances et financiers. Votre aide permettra de pouvoir réengager une entreprise avec laquelle nous avons déjà travaillé, qui fait un super travail. elle est actuellement dans les starting-blocks en attente du coup d’envoi pour la commencer.
Le crowdfounding est une chance incroyable de pouvoir créer un projet et le mener à bien, mais de nombreux projets ne sont hélas pas assez sponsorisés pour qu’ils puissent voir le jour!
C’est pour cela que nous avons décidé de revoir notre stratégie et de demander seulement une partie du budget afin de pouvoir commencer et nous espérons aussi pouvoir sponsoriser le reste par le biais de la vente de l’app, si nous ne parvenons pas au budget pour tout faire d’un coup!
Le budget du projet est de $ 16’240, mais pour démarrer et fournir l’application pour iPhone et une première version du site internet nous avons besoin de $ 7700.
Si les donations arrivent à dépasser les $ 7700, elles serviront à créer les applications pour les autres supports tels que pour Androïd et pour Windows phone. ainsi qu’avoir le site internet avec toutes les options que nous désirons vous offrir. Le budget final contient également une plus grosse part pour la communication et le marketing autour du projet.
Voilà les points principaux 

Ré-engagement l’entreprise avec laquelle nous avons déjà travaillé sur nos sites internet.
Création de l’identité visuelle finale de l’application et du site internet.
Création dans un premier temps et suivant la participation des donateurs, la création de l’application pour Iphone, puis Androïd et pour finir Windows phone.

Création du site internet, création des divers modules tels que celui qui vous permettra la création de vos cartes facilement pour les personnes ne maîtrisant pas les logiciels de création complexes, le module pour la création, la transformation et la personnalisation de sa carte en QrCode, etc...

Location de serveur, nom de domaine, etc...
Soutient  l'application après sa sortie.
Créer et mener une campagne marketing réussie.
Publicité.

N’est ce pas mieux de sponsoriser le projet de 10$ de plus et de passer à un niveau supérieur de cadeaux?

<p><i><strong>::: Introducing the Limited-Edition Rad-E Spinner ::: Made-in-the-USA</strong></i><br/>Hi, we're TFD.  TFD is a small family run business located in North Carolina, USA,  We create lots a unique tools and other gear including our own line of spinners.  The Rad-E Spinner is our latest design.  We're here on IndieGoGo to share this project with customers that appreciate great design and that is what the Rad-E is all about.</p>
<p>It's a unique all-metal spinner that has the same cam-driven, piston pumping action as a tri-piston radial engine.  This is a great spinner and fidget device for the gadget-freak, fidgeter, and spinner enthusiast</p>
<p><strong>First, let's talk all metal construction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brass pistons</li>
<li>Boca SR4 hybrid ceramic bearing (SI3N4 balls)</li>
<li>Stainless steel hardware, frame &amp; connecting rods</li>
<li>Natural and Flame-anodized stainless steel finger caps (cupped and spiral cut grips)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Custom Engineered Parts:  </strong>Rad-E Spinner starts with the 6 custom fabricated parts (2 brass parts &amp; 4 stainless steel parts). Cutting and shaping quality materials isn't easy, and materials were chosen after evaluating very low-friction interfaces for the piston motion.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502821119/spyuekpe8srbxzf18s4u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">TFD Rad-E Spinner!</p>
<p>As a mechanical engineer, I love engines, machines and anything mechanical (yeah, I know, very geeky, I'm just keeping it real!), so I wanted to make a cool looking spinner that incorporated moving parts.</p>
<p>We've designed the Rad-E to be easy to assemble and access the bearing,</p>
<p><u><strong><i>Dual-sided piston pumping action!</i></strong></u></p>

<div> </div>
<p>This design originates from 2 ideas:<br/>1. I really like kinetic designs that have more than one dimension of motion and,<br/>2. I've always been fascinated by the mechanical motion of radial piston engines used in aviation.</p>

</div></div>","::: Introducing the Limited-Edition Rad-E Spinner ::: Made-in-the-USAHi, we're TFD.  TFD is a small family run business located in North Carolina, USA,  We create lots a unique tools and other gear including our own line of spinners.  The Rad-E Spinner is our latest design.  We're here on IndieGoGo to share this project with customers that appreciate great design and that is what the Rad-E is all about.
It's a unique all-metal spinner that has the same cam-driven, piston pumping action as a tri-piston radial engine.  This is a great spinner and fidget device for the gadget-freak, fidgeter, and spinner enthusiast
First, let's talk all metal construction:

Brass pistons
Boca SR4 hybrid ceramic bearing (SI3N4 balls)
Stainless steel hardware, frame & connecting rods
Natural and Flame-anodized stainless steel finger caps (cupped and spiral cut grips)

Custom Engineered Parts:  Rad-E Spinner starts with the 6 custom fabricated parts (2 brass parts & 4 stainless steel parts). Cutting and shaping quality materials isn't easy, and materials were chosen after evaluating very low-friction interfaces for the piston motion.

TFD Rad-E Spinner!
As a mechanical engineer, I love engines, machines and anything mechanical (yeah, I know, very geeky, I'm just keeping it real!), so I wanted to make a cool looking spinner that incorporated moving parts.
We've designed the Rad-E to be easy to assemble and access the bearing,
Dual-sided piston pumping action!

 
This design originates from 2 ideas:1. I really like kinetic designs that have more than one dimension of motion and,2. I've always been fascinated by the mechanical motion of radial piston engines used in aviation.

<p>During this project (while building the prototypes and Kickstarter campaign) we have already encountered many challenges and problems that we had to find solutions to. While building the prototype we were sent the wrong components from manufacturers on multiple accounts, but we have solved them all and now have a functioning prototype. <br/>Now we see a few risks that might come up during the project that might make it more challenging for us. <br/>1. Marketing and not raising the goal we set in order to mass manufactor Snoozle. <br/>- We have found outside investors from Italy that will invest in our product if we raise half the money on Kickstarter which will show that this product is something that people want. We also ask for your help in sharing the campaign on social media with friends if you think Snoozle is a cool product.</p>
<p>2. Manufacturing delays. <br/>- We minimized this risk by lining up 3 manufacturers, so in case one doesn't come through, we have 2 more lined up. There is always a risk that the components we need might not be available in the quantity that we need. This all depends on how many backers we will have and how many Snoozle alarm clocks we will have to manufacture.</p>
<p>We commit to giving you frequent updates on the progress of the manufacturing process, packaging, and delivery of Snoozle. We want to make you part of the process and feedback is always welcome.</p>

<p>Feathr is a free mobile application designed to bring personal and professional networking into the digital age. Feathr streamlines the exchange of social profiles, websites, and media content as well as contact information in a touch-friendly, interactive format built for the smartphone's screen.</p>
<p>All Feathr cards come tightly integrated with simple yet powerful tools to automate the tedium of contact management and follow-up, making Feathr a lightweight end-to-end solution for all your networking needs.</p>
<p><strong>How Does Feathr Work?</strong></p>
<p><em>Touch. </em>Imagine a business card that's interactive, just one tap to send an email, open a website, or pull up someone's LinkedIn profile. Feathr is all that and more.</p>
<p><em>Share.</em> Easily send your Feathr card to anyone, even if they've never heard of Feathr before! As a cloud-based solution, non-users will be able to interact with your Feathr card through our web-app in their mobile browser.</p>
<p><em>Connect.</em> With Feathr Pro, contacts will sync across your phone, Outlook or <a href=""http://salesforce.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SalesForce.com</a>, and other existing address book software. Easily take notes and add tags to sort your contacts, set reminders that will sync with your calendar, and automatically generate follow-up email drafts.</p>
<p><strong>How will your support help us?</strong></p>
<p>We've built a beta prototype for Feathr using a tool called PhoneGap, which allows you to write an application that will run on both iOS and Android from the get-go. This was effective for initial beta testing and market validation, but there is a trade off in performance (speed, response time, smoothness) as well as limitations on certain features. </p>
<p>Now that we've proven demand and gathered initial feedback, we need to re-write the application in native code for iOS and Android separately in order to move forward with the next phase of our beta and official launch. We're asking for the time to continue working on this project full-time and produce the beautiful native versions of the Feathr application that showcase it's true potential.</p>
<p>If we exceed our $20,000 goal, we will be able to upgrade additional part-time teammates to full time, allowing us to get more done faster. This will translate into a quicker development process, more great features, and a faster/smoother/better overall experience for all Feathr users!</p></div>","What is Feathr?

If we exceed our $20,000 goal, we will be able to upgrade additional part-time teammates to full time, allowing us to get more done faster. This will translate into a quicker development process, more great features, and a faster/smoother/better overall experience for all Feathr users!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our idea is to create the ultimate blogging/website platform specializing in financial field. Where people can present themselves or their company, share their analysis, stock picks, experience, recommend books, schools and webinars. </p>
<p>One of the key ideas is that they will be able to sell their products right from their blog or website. Readers will be able to contact the author, ask questions and leave feedback. Teachers and Educational institutions will be able to organize webinars using our platform. Newsletters and digital social media companies can have their subscribers right in our website. </p>
<p>Another key idea is that people can search and find newsletters or media companies by their interests, see their ratings by other subscribers, or ask other subscribers for their feedback. Lets say I am interested in short term ideas about the energy sector. I can find people or media companies who specialize in that sector, talk to subscribers and subscribe for the one that meets my needs or interests. Right from my profile I will be able to do research with the <a href=""http://ggfinances.com/ggchart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://ggfinances.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ggfinances</a> platform, save my research in my profile, share with my friends, find out their opinion, put stock price alerts and much more. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This is the idea of ggfinances.com: to help people to make better decisions.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h1><strong>Our eCommerce tools</strong></h1>
<p>This is how our eCommerce tools will work. When you decide to make money with your blog you will fill out the financial section of your registration. When you sell your product(s) (book, software, hardware, services), we will process the payment securely to your account. When you are just a user and want to buy something, you will have to register and pay by using major online payment methods. We will also give an option to transfer some money in your ggfinances account and to make quick payments or set up an automatic payment, (if you subscribe to follow someone's real time trades or a newsletter). </p>
<p><strong>Our Backers </strong><strong>will receive their credit to their ggfinances account and make payments. Bloggers will be able to pay their service fees by using these credits. </strong>So this system will be similar to paypal or amazon. It will not be as good as their's in the beginning, but we will do everything to keep you guys happy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>How this will work</h1>
<p>It will have very simple design, you can completely customize it and it is Open Source. ggfinances allows you to write and publish your own blog, giving you the tools to make it easy and more professional. It's simple, elegant, and designed so that you can spend less time messing with making your blog work and more time for blogging or research. When you are creating your blog it will be as simple as this:</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>As we said It will be open source so you can work with HTML code in this mode.</p>

<h1>What makes us unique?</h1>
<p>There are a lot of blogging platforms out there. For example wordpress.com, blogger.com, tumblr.com and more, but only ggfinances.com is specialized in financial filed and it is extremely simple. It will bring professional investors and educators together with newbies.  </p>
<p><strong>Our traffic exchange system.</strong> Let's say Bob has just opened a new blog. He is a financial analyst with 30 years experience. Bob is not a tech guy, he does not know how to do SEO, market his blog or find online audience. With ggfinances his articles will appear in our main page, on our article stream shown below.</p>

<p>Bob wrote an article about particular stock (let's say Facebook). It will show up here:</p>

<p> <strong>So what is happening?        </strong></p>
<p>All the traffic that <a href=""http://ggfinances.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ggfinances.com</a> is getting is shared between the ggblogs. Our blogs are sending some of their traffic to us which is also shared between other blogs inside our network.  </p>

Our idea is to create the ultimate blogging/website platform specializing in financial field. Where people can present themselves or their company, share their analysis, stock picks, experience, recommend books, schools and webinars. 
One of the key ideas is that they will be able to sell their products right from their blog or website. Readers will be able to contact the author, ask questions and leave feedback. Teachers and Educational institutions will be able to organize webinars using our platform. Newsletters and digital social media companies can have their subscribers right in our website. 
Another key idea is that people can search and find newsletters or media companies by their interests, see their ratings by other subscribers, or ask other subscribers for their feedback. Lets say I am interested in short term ideas about the energy sector. I can find people or media companies who specialize in that sector, talk to subscribers and subscribe for the one that meets my needs or interests. Right from my profile I will be able to do research with the ggfinances platform, save my research in my profile, share with my friends, find out their opinion, put stock price alerts and much more.

<p> </p></figure></div><p> </p></div>","It seems as though our day to day life has been progressively consumed with never-ending checklists, mundane tasks of our 9-5 jobs and the mind-numbing scroll of our social media feeds. Although some tasks have become much easier with the advancement of technology, it seems we've lost the ability to hone into our own thoughts, ideas, and reflections of what we really want, think and believe in. 
 We found that many people (including ourselves) wear our overstimulation as a badge of honor; The more we do, the ""better"". We want to steer away from that socially constructed mindset and wanted to create a tool to help remind us to slow things down, be more mindful, present and overall more aware in our day-to-day. 
 
 For centuries and throughout different cultures around the globe, the egg has symbolized life, wealth and promise. Our goal was to use natural materials that can work in harmony with the eggs simple yet captivating symbology and design. Balancing at 17mm wide and 23.38mm tall, the Thinking Egg has been ergonomically designed to feel great in your hands while also being extremely portable.
 
 The Thinking Egg comes in four different organic materials that hold specific properties people can identify most to. Choose the Thinking Egg/s you can relate to most based on their specific metaphysical qualities. 
 
 The One, The Duo, The Nest and or The 1/2 Dozen... the choice is all yours. You'll be able to select which Thinking Egg/s you'd like to receive when we send out a quick survey at the end of the campaign.   
 
 
 
 
 This isn't our first rodeo. We've helped create and ship five other crowdfunding campaigns that were delivered successfully on time. We'll be continuing that tradition come fulfillment time for your Thinking Egg.

It was the very process of getting his car cleaned that led him on this journey. He found that the best-case scenario when taking his car to be cleaned was that he would be <strong>waiting </strong>for 30 minutes, watching someone clean his car. The reality was that he could be waiting around watching other people's cars be cleaned before they got to his, or worse he was turned away and forced to make an appointment for another day!</p><p><strong>The solution:</strong> Jody, with his fellow Co-Founder Sameer Marria, created a mobile app that enables us to bring a car cleaner to where <strong>you are</strong>, meaning this job can be done whilst you are occupied doing something else, freeing up your free time to be just that! Free time.</p><p><strong>Problem #2 - Water wastage:</strong> The second problem we came across, is a multi-faceted solution to a myriad of problems. <strong>Cleaning your car wastes on average 90 liters of water!</strong> Aside from being wasteful, creating a mobile solution that requires 90 liters of water per clean is hardly a scalable mobile solution!</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> A range of <strong>waterless car cleaning chemicals</strong> using the latest nanotechnology.

Firstly, we do a simple to follow online tutorial on using the non-harmful chemicals, followed by a series of test questions to assure they have comprehended the tutorial.

NOT-SO-SUPER GLUE
Let's face it: superglue is yesterday's adhesive.
It says it takes 30 seconds to set - yeah right! More like 30 minutes! It gets everywhere you don't want it to. AND it dries out when you don't want it to!
 

 
And if it really is so SUPER...then why do you also need epoxies for gap filling, sealants for cracks and leaks, and glue for specific materials?

 

 
Introducing TOTAL GLUE - the only glue you need!

You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.Play
 
 

Total Glue is a specially-formulated glue designed to cure instantly when exposed to blue light. Simply apply the glue, shine the included light on the glue, and in 5 seconds it will fully cure!
ALL-IN-ONE

Total Glue combines the strength of super glue, gap filling properties of epoxy, and light-curing speed of acrylic resin together to make the ULTIMATE glue...without all of the negative experiences associated with those adhesives!
SUPER GLUE VS TOTAL GLUE

You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.Play
 

Total Glue completely cures in 5 SECONDS when hit with the included blue light. Super Glue needs AT LEAST 1 minute to set...and then 24 hours for a full cure!
EPOXY VS TOTAL GLUE

You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.Play

Total Glue is your gap filling choice over epoxy - NO mixing required, NO mess, and it cures in seconds instead of minutes!
 


OTHER LIGHT-CURING ADHESIVES VS TOTAL GLUE

You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.Play
 

You may have seen other adhesives on the market that cure with light. One big difference is that Total Glue bonds objects together with or without the light, while the other acrylic adhesives CANNOT bond without the light.

 

Total Glue's unique light-curing properties enable it to perform hundreds of different types of repairs.

 
BOND, FILL, SEAL, & REBUILD
BONDS WITH AND WITHOUT LIGHT

 
Total Glue bonds in 5 seconds when exposed to the blue light, making repairs and projects happen faster than ever! Unlike other light-curing glues on the market, Total Glue ALSO bonds objects without the light - it just takes about a minute to cure.
FILLS GAPS LIKE EPOXY

Because Total Glue cures with light, it can fill gaps like an epoxy, but without the annoying mixing process, and the inevitable messes! Just alternate between applying Total Glue and curing with light to build up layers until your hole or gap is filled!
SEALS CRACKS AND LEAKS

Use Total Glue to seal off cracks in tile, counters, pipes, and more! You can also insulate exposed wires on computer and phone cords, saving you from the costly replacements.
REBUILD/CREATE OBJECTS

Rebuild structures like handles and key fobs with Total Repair, or create new objects like a bolt for a screw!
WORKS ON ALL MATERIALS
WOOD

METAL

PLASTIC

GLASS

CERAMIC

HIGH STRENGTH BOND
Total Glue not only cures very fast, but it cures very STRONG. Watch us lift a bowling ball with Total Glue below!

SANDABLE & PAINTABLE

Total Glue can be sanded down and painted. No ugly repairs or projects here!
 
CRAFT LIKE A PRO
Total Glue is the perfect tool for crafters and creators.

Its precision application tips allow for delicate projects to be accomplished without the mess, and the resin cures clear leaving no residue!

The blue light cures the glue when you need it to, and where you want it to, helping you get more projects done faster.

Because the glue cures with and without the light, you don't need to keep switching out different adhesives for different projects!

 
SO MUCH MORE!
We can't even begin to cover all of the amazing things you can accomplish with Total Glue. Here are a few more examples:
3-D PRINTING

CIRCUITRY

SHOE REPAIR

5g of Glue – Specially formulated glue can be cured by blue light or pressure
Plastic Casing +Squeeze Applicator – Protective casing for easy application and storage
Blue Light – Removable blue light LED and applicator to cure glue in seconds; batteries included
Applicator Tip + Precision Tip: Total Glue comes with applicator tip for clean and easy application. A separate precision tip is also included for very small and precise repairs.
Cap – Keeps the glue from drying out
 


We learned about light-curing adhesives from the dentist office, and were blown away by the properties that make them so useful to dentists! So we set out to use this technology to make a glue to end all glues!

It took over 2 years for us to find the perfect adhesive that met all of our requirements:

Cures in 5 seconds by light application
Also cures under pressure where no light can get in
Maintains the same strength level as super glue
Works on all surfaces
Weak scent

We tried the following types of adhesives:
1. Cyanoacrylate: This is the type of adhesive found in regular super glues. However, we couldn’t find one that cured under light.
2. Acrylic-based adhesives: Acrylic adhesives can be cured by UV light (you’ll see these in a lot of “As Seen on TV” products), but the bonding capabilities are poor, and such adhesives can’t cure under pressure without the light.
Finally we discovered a specially-formulated methoxyethyl cyanoacrylate, that could both bond under pressure and cure instantly under blue light! It also met our other requirements, making us confident enough to bring this product to you!

A published article on Wingman by Lighting Rumours 
 
The Wingman was developed by a visual industry veteran Viveck Bansal, founder and CEO of Viren Banserv Limited, Hong Kong and Creative Director at Studio vB.
""Like many of my fellow photographers I have always been dependent upon other technological suppliers to ease my work-flow….
and there are many good flash triggers available but none of them offer more than the basic trigger with limited exposure control and no possibility for new features.  I thought long and hard and decided to design and build an essential tool for the working photographer.""  - Viveck Bansal
 
Meet your Wingman
The Wingman reinvents wireless triggers and speedlight controllers. It is a multi controller that goes beyond fixed design. It’s smart and modular design is easy to use and can accommodate any new features and functions without hardware limitations.
""It’s a pocket-sized helper that’s really big on features. 
I spent countless hours designing it, building it, checking it, going back to the drawing board, tinkering some more, till I was ready to reveal it."" – vB
At its heart is a powerful ARM Cortex 32bit fast and energy efficient processor, a universally accepted 2.4GHz transreceiver with auto-acknowledge, a smart OLED display, an intelligent accessories port, user friendly-adaptable navigation and a managed power system.

There is manual independent sub-stop exposure control for speedlights and a unique collective control of all light groups and a visual remote speed-light status indicator on the transmitter
It also has various test fire modes to ease creative lighting workflow

<p>Imagine this: you wake up in the morning, get dressed, make coffee....but instead of leaving the house feeling frazzled with your long to-do list running through your head, you walk over to your Kindness Calendar hanging in the kitchen and pick your kindness mission for the day. In one fell swoop you feel re-centered, filled with purpose and intent, and excited at the prospect of helping another AND getting an endorphin release. This is the power of the Kindness Calendar, which gives you a new Act of Kindness to commit daily. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""UNEXPECTED KINDNESS IS THE MOST POWERFUL, LEAST COSTLY, AND MOST UNDERRATED AGENT OF HUMAN CHANGE."" BOB KERREY</strong></p>
<p>My name is Oriana Galardi-Este and I'm the founder of the Kindness Calendar. My mission is simple: to transform the world, one Act of Kindness at a time. There's a monumental misconception that a complex solution is needed to fix the world's problems. I believe that the world can and WILL be put right through the exponential growth of small and simple acts of Love. I've seen the powerful effects and massive reverberations that one act creates with my own eyes. Hearts are opened, guards are shed, bridges are rebuilt, and in turn, more kindness and love are propagated. Let's work together to create a continuous momentum of Love - an upward spiral - which will, in turn, ignite a Kindness Revolution, and in the words of Martin Kornfeld: set the world in the right direction.  </p>
<h3>Why I created the Kindness Calendar</h3>
<p>Kindness Calendars was born from the painful experience of separating from my husband. After spending a couple of months completely engrossed in my heartache and loneliness,  I unintentionally engaged in an act of kindness at the grocery store, and it dawned on me that for the first time in ages, my focus had shifted from me and my pain, to another's needs, resulting in a lightness of being, a strong feeling of connection, and a deep sense of elation that I hadn't felt in months. Committing random acts of kindness became a daily ritual and a means to healing my broken heart. I strongly believe that the speed with which my heart mended is directly correlated to this powerful practice that brought me out of my head and my ruminating thoughts, and back into my heart space. Having experienced the incredible effects of committing regular acts of kindness on my life, relationships, and overall well-being AND living in a world currently inundated with so much hate, violence and despair - it felt time to share my findings and to help infuse the world with a massive dose of kindness. And so was born: The Kindness Calendar.</p>
<p>I think it's safe to say that most of us are feeling incredibly disillusioned by the current state of the world, and feel powerless to help. So my main incentive in getting the Kindness Calendar out into the world is to empower people to affect change by equipping them with a truly potent yet affordable and simple tool.</p>
<p>The truth is that we are each powerful beyond belief - and my hope is to prove this via the widespread use of the Kindness Calendar. Alice Walker had it right when she said: ""The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any."" I dare you to try the Kindness Calendar for 30 days and witness firsthand just how powerful your actions are. It's a complete game changer. A complete LIFE changer. And I have absolutely no doubt that the Kindness Calendar can and will change the world!</p>

<h3>Endorsements</h3>
<p> “I consider it a great day when I can look back and know that I gave more than I took. One way to give is through demonstrating and sharing kindness with customers, employees and my leadership team.  Over the past 30 years, we have moved farther away from helping others, to becoming more self-serving.  The heart is like a parachute…it only works when it is open. In my experience, profits AND productivity increase when the entire workforce operates from an open heart. Utilizing the Kindness Calendar in our office will enable our employees to think about how they treat each other and our customers.  I also believe the Kindness Calendar will spark creativity in how we demonstrate a couple of our key corporate values – RESPECT and POSITIVE ATTITUDE."" <br/><strong>Keith Blackmon - Vice-President CPE Commercial Sales &amp; Support</strong></p>
<p>""Increasingly, the research in the field of neuroscience speaks to the theme of interconnectivity. When our attachments and connections go awry or are disrupted for any reason, a myriad of symptoms can result. As a licensed therapist with 35 years of clinical experience I have learned to never underestimate the power and impact of kindness. The Kindness Calendar bridges neuroscience and diverse therapies together into the perfect tool for my clients that will allow them to experience increased connectivity, higher self-esteem, and ultimately will help them overcome trauma, depression and anxiety. A simple yet potent tool. Well done, Oriana.""</p>

<p>""Corporate culture is something we work on and talk about daily. We strive to provide phenomenal service, to treat each other with great respect, to source amazing ingredients, and to make the best decisions we can for our planet and its people - all things that require a great amount of care and kindness. I am looking forward to using the Kindness Calendars in our businesses as a way for our team to help make our community an even better place to be.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is a Kindness Calendar?</strong></p>
<p>The Kindness Calendar is a wall-hanging calendar made of fabric and wood, that features 30 mini burlap pockets each made to house one or more laminated act of kindness cards. The calendar is made by hand in the USA, is of exceptional quality and built to last. The calendars can easily be folded up and stored when not in use. In fact, we encourage our customers to only have it out when it is consciously being used so as to not become desensitized to it. It can be used anytime of year, as Kindness has no season. </p>
<p><strong>Can the whole family use the Kindness Calendar?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! The reason we offer so many different Kindness Packs tailored to a variety of ages and themes is to ensure that everybody is able to participate. We love to think of the Kindness Calendar as a powerful tool to increase family and couple bonding. We love the idea of families discovering their kindness mission for the day at breakfast, and then each going about their respective days and committing their act, and then coming home and discussing their experience over dinner with each other. What a powerful way to begin and end the day. </p>
<p><strong>The striped blue fabric and pink floral fabric I see in the photos don't match my home decor/aren't really my style...will you be offering any other fabric options?</strong></p>
<p>We currently have 4 fabric options for you to choose from. By mid-August, we will have many more fabric options. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>What happens once I've committed all 30 acts?</strong></p>
<p>Once you've committed all 30 acts, you'll most likely be feeling so good you'll be hungry for more. The good news is that you've got a myriad of choices: you can buy another Kindness Pack for a brand new set of acts; you can re-use your current Kindness Pack; you can invest in different packs and then mix and match. For example you could mix the Adult pack with the Bravery pack to allow yourself to focus on serving others AND simultaneously increasing your courage. Another example would be to mix the Couple pack with the Self-Love pack to allow you and your love to grow in intimacy while simultaneously increasing your respective self-love. Get creative and have fun!</p>
<p><strong>What languages are the Kindness Packs available in?</strong></p>
<p>Our Kindness Packs are available in English only for now, with the hope of expanding to other languages in the future. </p>
<p><strong>Can I claim more than one reward at once?</strong></p>
<p>It's exciting to hear that you've found multiple perks you are interested in getting!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at this time, Indiegogo does not have a feature for you to be able to add multiple perks in a single transaction. As such, if you'd like to claim multiple perks, please make a new contribution for each perk. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your support!</p>

In one word: REPETITION. Repetition is powerful. It creates habit. It's through repetition that we rewire our brains. Imagine a world in which committing daily acts of kindness has become an automatic reflex by thousands. Can you picture it? Can you picture the number of people walking around smiling brightly? Glowing even? 
""WE ARE WHAT WE REPEATEDLY DO. EXCELLENCE THEN, IS NOT AN ACT, BUT A HABIT."" ARISTOTLE

 

PERFECT F​OR CHILDREN AT HOME AND IN THE CLASSROOM
Let's help our children be happier, more confident, more joyful, and help them understand the power of their actions and the power of kindness! Let's teach our children how to be contributing members of society, and let's teach them the value of service. Let's reduce bullying by increasing kindness both at home and at school!


 


KINDNESS IN THE WORKPLACE
FACT: Happy workers are on average 31% more productive and 3x more creative.
Ever worked for someone who was self-absorbed and filled with negativity? Ever worked in an office environment where you felt disconnected, unappreciated and unseen? Is your business struggling to offer consistently excellent customer service? Then your office needs a Kindness Calendar. Research shows that when employees feel connected, appreciated and seen by both their boss and their peers, their happiness increases, resulting in a spike in productivity, creativity and ultimately, company prosperity. Do you want to see your company thrive? Put up a Kindness Calendar in the break room, and watch as your office culture magically transforms. 


Endorsements
 “I consider it a great day when I can look back and know that I gave more than I took. One way to give is through demonstrating and sharing kindness with customers, employees and my leadership team.  Over the past 30 years, we have moved farther away from helping others, to becoming more self-serving.  The heart is like a parachute…it only works when it is open. In my experience, profits AND productivity increase when the entire workforce operates from an open heart. Utilizing the Kindness Calendar in our office will enable our employees to think about how they treat each other and our customers.  I also believe the Kindness Calendar will spark creativity in how we demonstrate a couple of our key corporate values – RESPECT and POSITIVE ATTITUDE."" Keith Blackmon - Vice-President CPE Commercial Sales & Support
""Increasingly, the research in the field of neuroscience speaks to the theme of interconnectivity. When our attachments and connections go awry or are disrupted for any reason, a myriad of symptoms can result. As a licensed therapist with 35 years of clinical experience I have learned to never underestimate the power and impact of kindness. The Kindness Calendar bridges neuroscience and diverse therapies together into the perfect tool for my clients that will allow them to experience increased connectivity, higher self-esteem, and ultimately will help them overcome trauma, depression and anxiety. A simple yet potent tool. Well done, Oriana.""
Bruce Nelson - MSW CCSW
""Corporate culture is something we work on and talk about daily. We strive to provide phenomenal service, to treat each other with great respect, to source amazing ingredients, and to make the best decisions we can for our planet and its people - all things that require a great amount of care and kindness. I am looking forward to using the Kindness Calendars in our businesses as a way for our team to help make our community an even better place to be. This tool will allow us to make random acts of kindness a habit, which will put us well on our way to creating a culture we can be proud of.""

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
What is a Kindness Calendar?
The Kindness Calendar is a wall-hanging calendar made of fabric and wood, that features 30 mini burlap pockets each made to house one or more laminated act of kindness cards. The calendar is made by hand in the USA, is of exceptional quality and built to last. The calendars can easily be folded up and stored when not in use. In fact, we encourage our customers to only have it out when it is consciously being used so as to not become desensitized to it. It can be used anytime of year, as Kindness has no season. 
Can the whole family use the Kindness Calendar?
Absolutely! The reason we offer so many different Kindness Packs tailored to a variety of ages and themes is to ensure that everybody is able to participate. We love to think of the Kindness Calendar as a powerful tool to increase family and couple bonding. We love the idea of families discovering their kindness mission for the day at breakfast, and then each going about their respective days and committing their act, and then coming home and discussing their experience over dinner with each other. What a powerful way to begin and end the day. 
The striped blue fabric and pink floral fabric I see in the photos don't match my home decor/aren't really my style...will you be offering any other fabric options?
We currently have 4 fabric options for you to choose from. By mid-August, we will have many more fabric options. Stay tuned!
What happens once I've committed all 30 acts?
Once you've committed all 30 acts, you'll most likely be feeling so good you'll be hungry for more. The good news is that you've got a myriad of choices: you can buy another Kindness Pack for a brand new set of acts; you can re-use your current Kindness Pack; you can invest in different packs and then mix and match. For example you could mix the Adult pack with the Bravery pack to allow yourself to focus on serving others AND simultaneously increasing your courage. Another example would be to mix the Couple pack with the Self-Love pack to allow you and your love to grow in intimacy while simultaneously increasing your respective self-love. Get creative and have fun!
What languages are the Kindness Packs available in?
Our Kindness Packs are available in English only for now, with the hope of expanding to other languages in the future. 
Can I claim more than one reward at once?
It's exciting to hear that you've found multiple perks you are interested in getting!
Unfortunately, at this time, Indiegogo does not have a feature for you to be able to add multiple perks in a single transaction. As such, if you'd like to claim multiple perks, please make a new contribution for each perk. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your support!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

To ink your thoughts on paper is a direct connection between you and your ideas. Even in this digital world, it is impossible to ignore the need for a pen. Whether it's taking notes, signing a check, or addressing an envelope, you cannot escape the requirement to use a pen. Many of us embrace this refreshingly analog need as special. There is something irreplaceably tactile about putting your thoughts in a notebook, sketching a diagram, or simply documenting an idea without the need of a power plug or battery. There are numerous pen designs in existence, and there are literally billions of pens in use all around the world. There are no barriers, everyone knows what a pen looks like and we all use them. It is the most natural, intuitive way to communicate in writing.</p><p>At TEC Accessories, we use pens. A lot. We carry journals for documenting our daily actions, we make sketches in Field Notes booklets to jot down a concept when a thought flashes through our minds. We adore the pen and paper medium. So when we chose to develop a completely new pen design, we abandoned our preconceived notions of what a pen is and what it isn't. We redesigned from the ground up. After many months of planning, development, prototyping, and testing, we are pleased to present you the result of our effort through this Indiegogo campaign.</p><h2>Introducing the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen:</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522198516/lce1frhxdpxwhveljyto.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We've abandoned the cylindrical shape of a traditional pen. Instead, the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen leverages the benefits of a flat, wide, rectangular geometry for unparalleled writing comfort and low-profile carry. Rather than cramping your fingers around a thin cylindrical shaft, you can embrace your writing instrument in a more natural way that provides long term comfort with less tension on your fingers. The 4-1/2"" length is optimized to deliver a fluid writing experience in your hand, yet be incredibly compact for convenient everyday carry. The magnetic twin-rail mechanism used to extend and retract the ink refill eliminates the need for a separate cap, ensuring you have nothing to lose. Combined with an instant, no-tool refill replacement method, the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen will always be your pen of choice. Its elegance, comfort, and simplicity will make you wonder why this never happened sooner.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/tec-accessories/Ko-Axis+Animation.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Extend/Retract Refill Animation</i></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522088560/fkey6paxtk7bs0b97tik.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Titanium Blue Raspberry Edition</i></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522088879/vm2mxzworxiebod5iaiv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522088980/hg1fkuuske6ve5xttoxr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522174597/lbfwmhpkvqbs8xuz1umu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul>

The comfort and ergonomics that were considered in the design phase are unparalleled, resulting in a truly unique writing experience. These features create an aesthetic that turns heads. All of these features have been packed into a pen so thin that it easily hides in any notebook. We have spent countless hours and fabricated over one hundred 3D printed prototypes with the sole purpose of selecting the perfect form factor for long term writing sessions. Be warned: once you write with the Ko-Axis™, you will never go back to a conventional pen.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522174775/lxjtk91bjpqyy0mnlfkv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>ACTUATION:</h3><p>Upon closer inspection of the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen, you will discover that the aluminum bronze grip slider contains the ink cartridge. By implementing this clever design, it is impossible for the pen to accidentally retract while writing. The ink refill is always present when you need it and never when you don't. We have painstakingly integrated eight ultra-strong neodymium magnets into the end stop positions to ensure perfect engagement, and eliminate any potential for movement of the mechanism while writing. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522174825/oglmlbyhdpnub7qcr8lp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Magnet end stops</i></p><p> </p><h3>WRITING EXPERIENCE:</h3><p>The Ko-axis™ isn’t just a beautiful writing instrument, it transforms the act of writing into a wonderful experience. From the first time you extend the ink refill, you’re hooked. The rectangular shape of the Ko-axis™ rests gently in the crease of your hand and lands comfortably in your thumb-and-finger pinch. The shallow divot in the finely polished aluminum bronze offers the perfect spot for your pointer to land every time. The weight distribution of the pen was carefully calculated to rest in your hand without applying any torque to your fingers that would tire your hand in a late-night writing session. The Aluminum Edition is the featherlight member of the Ko-Axis™ family. The aluminum body allows the pen to float effortlessly across page after page. The Titanium Edition has 25% more mass than its aluminum brother, providing a solid and comfortable resilience that will last a lifetime.

<li>The refill cover tube is manufactured from stainless steel surgical tubing</li>
<li>The integrated pocket clip is formed from 301 stainless spring steel</li>
<li>N52 Neodymium magnets with the highest magnetic strength/size ratio available</li>

Although we handle most of the work in-house, there are some processes that are performed under contract with our outside vendors (who we have dealt with for many years). For example, although we now have the ability to anodize titanium in-house, we do not have the capability of performing the aluminum anodizing or the Black Diamond finishing in-house. Therefore, there is always the possibility that problems may arise that are out of our control. We do find this unlikely, however we will do our best to ensure adherence to schedule and advise backers immediately if there are any issues that may affect delivery.

Whether it's taking notes, signing a check, or addressing an envelope, you cannot escape the requirement to use a pen. Many of us embrace this refreshingly analog need as special. There is something irreplaceably tactile about putting your thoughts in a notebook, sketching a diagram, or simply documenting an idea without the need of a power plug or battery. There are numerous pen designs in existence, and there are literally billions of pens in use all around the world. There are no barriers, everyone knows what a pen looks like and we all use them. It is the most natural, intuitive way to communicate in writing.At TEC Accessories, we use pens. A lot. We carry journals for documenting our daily actions, we make sketches in Field Notes booklets to jot down a concept when a thought flashes through our minds. We adore the pen and paper medium. So when we chose to develop a completely new pen design, we abandoned our preconceived notions of what a pen is and what it isn't. We redesigned from the ground up. After many months of planning, development, prototyping, and testing, we are pleased to present you the result of our effort through this Indiegogo campaign.Introducing the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen:We've abandoned the cylindrical shape of a traditional pen. Instead, the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen leverages the benefits of a flat, wide, rectangular geometry for unparalleled writing comfort and low-profile carry. Rather than cramping your fingers around a thin cylindrical shaft, you can embrace your writing instrument in a more natural way that provides long term comfort with less tension on your fingers. The 4-1/2"" length is optimized to deliver a fluid writing experience in your hand, yet be incredibly compact for convenient everyday carry. The magnetic twin-rail mechanism used to extend and retract the ink refill eliminates the need for a separate cap, ensuring you have nothing to lose. Combined with an instant, no-tool refill replacement method, the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen will always be your pen of choice. Its elegance, comfort, and simplicity will make you wonder why this never happened sooner. Extend/Retract Refill Animation Titanium Blue Raspberry Edition    
Flat geometry: The rectangular shape provides comfort during long writing sessions
6 mm low-profile body (less than 1/4"" thick) for discrete storage when carried or clipped
The perfect pen to accompany journals, notebooks, diaries, etc.
The embedded micro socket provides an ""Instant"", no hassle refill replacement that does not require tools: pull-to-remove/push-to-insert
Accepts a wide variety of commonly available D1 stylus refills, including Fisher pressurized refills (in case you want to write upside-down)
Unique, twin-rail skeletonized body is strong, lightweight and will make heads turn
Magnetic actuation and retention mechanism
Balanced design for the ultimate writing experience
No possibility of accidental ink retraction during use
Flat, anti-roll design stays where you put it
Symmetrical profile allows for identical writing comfort for both right and left hand usage
Assembled from 24 individual, custom machined and critically selected components, to ensure a high quality, bulletproof pen that will last a lifetime
The following dimensions are in millimeters [inches]:Refill Extended Refill Retracted Magnet Actuation  SPECIFICATIONS:  
Weight (Aluminum Editions): 46 grams (1.6 oz)
Weight (Titanium Editions): 56 grams [2 oz.]
Size: 6 mm x 109 mm x 22 mm (.236"" x 4.29"" x 0.866"")
Height with clip: approximately 8.77 mm (0.35”)
Materials: As stated above
Refill Actuation: Magnetic Push/Pull
Refill Replacement: Pull-to-remove, Push-to-insert
 FORM FACTOR:We've designed the Ko-Axis™ with a purpose-built, distinctive shape, sparing no detail. The comfort and ergonomics that were considered in the design phase are unparalleled, resulting in a truly unique writing experience. These features create an aesthetic that turns heads. All of these features have been packed into a pen so thin that it easily hides in any notebook. We have spent countless hours and fabricated over one hundred 3D printed prototypes with the sole purpose of selecting the perfect form factor for long term writing sessions. Be warned: once you write with the Ko-Axis™, you will never go back to a conventional pen. ACTUATION:Upon closer inspection of the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen, you will discover that the aluminum bronze grip slider contains the ink cartridge. By implementing this clever design, it is impossible for the pen to accidentally retract while writing. The ink refill is always present when you need it and never when you don't. We have painstakingly integrated eight ultra-strong neodymium magnets into the end stop positions to ensure perfect engagement, and eliminate any potential for movement of the mechanism while writing. Magnet end stops WRITING EXPERIENCE:The Ko-axis™ isn’t just a beautiful writing instrument, it transforms the act of writing into a wonderful experience. From the first time you extend the ink refill, you’re hooked. The rectangular shape of the Ko-axis™ rests gently in the crease of your hand and lands comfortably in your thumb-and-finger pinch. The shallow divot in the finely polished aluminum bronze offers the perfect spot for your pointer to land every time. The weight distribution of the pen was carefully calculated to rest in your hand without applying any torque to your fingers that would tire your hand in a late-night writing session. The Aluminum Edition is the featherlight member of the Ko-Axis™ family. The aluminum body allows the pen to float effortlessly across page after page. The Titanium Edition has 25% more mass than its aluminum brother, providing a solid and comfortable resilience that will last a lifetime. Every titanium model affords a rock-solid, stable action and exudes confidence in every word it writes. MATERIALS:Although the materials and finishes will vary depending upon the reward you select, materials used in the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen include: 
Body materials - aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum or aerospace grade Ti-6Al-4V titanium
The slider and refill guide are made from QAl 9-4 aluminum bronze, a durable bearing material known for its low coefficient of friction. This provides ultra smooth travel of the slider actuation mechanism as well as the perfect weight and balance
The twin guide rails are solid stainless steel precision rod, with a highly polished finish for super-smooth acutation
The refill cover tube is manufactured from stainless steel surgical tubing
The integrated pocket clip is formed from 301 stainless spring steel
N52 Neodymium magnets with the highest magnetic strength/size ratio available
We are also offering a very special version of the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen with the body components being manufactured from Titanium Damascus. This material is a high strength titanium composite formed by diffusion welding and offers an absolutely stunning, colorful grain pattern. Although we have not actually made any prototypes with this material due to the extremely high cost, we have placed an order for the raw material so we will be ready to begin machining the parts in parallel with the production run in order to fulfill this very unique reward. The image shown below is a CAD rendering of the Titanium Damascus Edition to give you an idea of it's final appearance. We should also point out that due to cost considerations of the material, there will only be 10 units available of this exclusive model.Titanium Damascus CAD Model FINISHING:All aluminum body components are finished using TEC Accessories' micro polishing process, and anodized in a selection of beautiful, hyper-saturated colorsAll titanium body components are either semi-polished (bare titanium model) or micro-polished (anodized model) to a fine uniform finish that will stand up to abuseOur in-house titanium anodizing process has been refined over the years to consistently achieve an astonishing array of remarkable colors that takes style to the next level. Our Blue Raspberry tint is the absolute epitome of this color palette, and is our prime choice for this Special Edition of the Ko-Axis™ Rail PenTEC’s Black Diamond Finish is a proprietary, nano-composite microlayer, uniquely replicating diamond’s low friction, high hardness and superb corrosion resistance. Genuine TEC products with Black Diamond Finish provide an extremely durable, near-black coating that offers exceptional wear resistance and a stunning color contrast that is impossible to ignoreBlue Raspberry Titanium Anodizing Black Diamond FinishThe Ko-Axis™ is built to last. The materials, fit, and finish are impressive and you will agree the instant you pick it up. No plastic to break, no cheap steel to rust, no plating to flake off, and no parts that will wear out. This pen will last a lifetime.INK REFILLS:When determining which ink refill to include in the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen, it was an easy decision. Nothing but the best will do, so we selected the Monteverde D1/Multipen refill, which we think is the best refill on the planet. This medium point, black ink refill is the perfect way to experience everything the Ko-Axis™ has to offer. It features Soft Roll ink technology which is a low viscosity ink for the smoothest writing experience, with a high quality nickel silver tube and a Swiss tip.However, any D1 style refill will work in the Ko-Axis™, including but not limited to the following:
Schmidt 635 Mini D1
Lamy Mini Ballpoint Refill M21
Kaweco D1
Monteverde D1/Multipen
Parker D1
Zebra Sharbo X Gel Ink Multi Pen/D1
Zebra ESB-0.7 Emulsion Ink Ballpoint Pen Refill - D1
Ohto R-4C7NP Needle-Point D1
Rotring D1 Multi Pen
Fisher mini ballpoint refill with adjustable lengths (shortest length)
Compatible D1 Ink Refills MANUFACTURING:This product is proudly made in the USA, at our Tucson Arizona facility. All parts are inspected, polished, finished, assembled, tested and packaged to our own internal set of rigorous standards. In order to provide the most uniform and consistent part finishes achievable, our polishing process can take upwards of 2 weeks, depending upon the material of the parts. In addition, we are already developing tooling and fixtures to maintain consistency and accuracy of the entire assembly process. We are addressing this now to mitigate any possible delays in the production schedule. All of this effort is to ensure you receive a product of uncompromising quality that you can be proud of for a lifetime. We unconditionally warrant the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen for 90 days against defects in materials and workmanship, because we believe there should be zero risk in the purchasing process.PACKAGING:When developing a pen as unique as the Ko-Axis™ we looked at every aspect with excruciating detail, and this extends all the way down to the packaging. The Ko-Axis™ not only deserves to be protected in a way that is as unique as it's appearance, but also guarantees you will receive your reward safely, and also without passing down a high cost to the customer.  So we came up with a novel approach using laser cut layered acrylic sheet, fabricated in-house, that is cost effective and just as amazing in appearance as the pen itself.Ready for safe travel A BRIEF LOOK BACK - PROTOTYPING:Prototyping a new design can be fun and exhilarating, but it takes obsessive commitment and unrelenting willpower to iterate all the way to your 103rd model. Sometimes that is what it takes to get a product refined to a point of perfection. The first of over 100 3D printed prototype modelsWe have had three revisions of machined parts fabricated and spent countless man hours of engineering time to get to this milestone. Each iteration bringing us closer, but not all the way, to the final design. After months of brainstorming, obsessing, changing and improving, we are finally ready for prime time.One thing we should mention here, is that the pocket clip you see in the pictures is not the final production version. We hand-formed a number of clips made from different material thicknesses to ensure we could get the correct tension when in use. However getting actual clips fabricated will require tooling. That is why we need your help, so that we can move into full production on these final details. The actual clip that will be included with your rewards will look very similar to the CAD model images shown above. Download the Press Kit here.For PR inquiries, please email sales@tecaccessories.comThe timeline below reflects our immediate release of parts procurement when the campaign is successfully funded. To ensure you receive your Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen as soon as humanly possible, we will not wait for receipt of Indiegogo funding (approximate 2 week delay) to initiate production. Once the campaign has ended and we are successfully funded, we plan to have additional accessories available for purchase on our web site, at a special discount to Indiegogo backers. You will be able to purchase these items prior to your order being shipped, so you can receive everything in one package and avoid any additional shipping charges. These accessories will allow you to customize your Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen to reflect your personal style, with items such as Black Diamond coated rails and clips, hardware of anodized colors or different materials, and keychain attachments.  The following is a summary of all available rewards, at Indiegogo early bird pricing. If you wish to order more than one version, choose one reward and simply total the price for all units desired and pledge that amount. We will confirm pricing and selection at the end of the campaign. Please refer to the Reward boxes for more details.TEC Accessories has been developing personal accessories since 2004, and has established a reputation for high quality, value, and excellent customer service.Pleasanton, California OfficeOur administrative office in Pleasanton California manages corporate operations and product development. Our facility in Tucson Arizona manages all production and order fulfillment. We process orders from our web site and our reseller network on a daily basis, typically within one working day. We have trained staff to accommodate this campaign. We will not hire short-term inexperienced workers to assemble and ship your order. You can be assured that your Indiegogo rewards will be packaged, processed and shipped using the same care and attention we have been performing at TEC Accessories every work day for the last 14 years.This is not our first rodeo. We are proud to say we have already completed wildly successful Indiegogo and Kickstarter campaign, in which we fulfilled all of our shipping commitments and held to our stringent quality standards. It is equally important to know that we've also run a Kickstarter campaign that did not reach our funding goal. Discouraged but not defeated, we went on to self-fund and launch the product anyway. At the announcement of the product launch, we allowed those who pledged during the campaign a discount to receive their product at the deeply discounted Kickstarter price to show our gratitude for supporting us.We take our commitment to deliver your Indiegogo pledge gravely serious. Once we launch a campaign, we respect and honor the obligation to ship you your purchase and in the time frame we have promised. In addition, we guarantee that you will receive your purchase before the Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen is sold to anyone on the open market. The purpose of a crowdfunding campaign is to bring a product to market with the support and cooperation of an incredibly special group of investors. We are humbled by your faith in us and we hope to bring you many more products in the future.Risks and challenges:TEC Accessories is very experienced in developing, manufacturing and delivering fine quality personal accessories. We are fully prepared to release production at the end of the campaign and are confident in our ability to deliver. The Ko-Axis™ Rail Pen design is complete, prototypes have been fabricated and tested and packaging is in development. Although we handle most of the work in-house, there are some processes that are performed under contract with our outside vendors (who we have dealt with for many years). For example, although we now have the ability to anodize titanium in-house, we do not have the capability of performing the aluminum anodizing or the Black Diamond finishing in-house. Therefore, there is always the possibility that problems may arise that are out of our control. We do find this unlikely, however we will do our best to ensure adherence to schedule and advise backers immediately if there are any issues that may affect delivery. If you have any questions, we encourage you to contact us.",27.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<br/>
<br/><h3>Cashmaker Summary <b>- How it Started and How it’s Now!</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>Let’s
make short a long story!</p>
<p>The
story of Cashmaker started going back to 2008 when I did started to invest in the
currencies forex market, and like everybody else I was looking for some miraculous
thing to allows me to make big big money in a very short period of time</p>
<p>I
mean, I was looking for some “<i>Get Rich Quick</i>” forex tools… Get it?!</p>
<p>By that
time I haven’t any forex market trading experience.</p>
<p>The inexperience
result was that for the next 3 years I did invest and lost lots of money on
forex market. Then, in 2011 I did developed my own strategy based in a secret
that I have found in a meanwhile by myself. </p>
<p>That
secret strategy is so effective that I have turned a $10.000 account into an
account over $550.000 in just 2½ years! Pretty
amazing, right?!... <b><a href=""http://cashmakerforex.com/r/detailedstatement.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(check here full results report)</a> </b><br/></p>
<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1160715/files/20150119170114-results.png?1421715674"" src="""" style=""width: 583.608px; height: 333px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Then, I
have shared those results for FREE with other small forex investors around the
world via mql5, becoming the most subscribed (#1) forex signal at that sharing
signals platform with <b>over 1000 subscribers</b>. (Here some followers screenshots)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1160721/files/20150119170434-nnumber1.png?1421715874"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>(Do you
know … Through a free forex signals platform, all Cashmaker trades are copied directly
to subscribers trading accounts?)</p></blockquote>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1160722/files/20150119170443-subscribers.jpg?1421715883"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Of course,
these kind of results attracted the attention of several forex brokers and big funds
managers around the world, so they have started asking me to tell them the Cashmaker Secret! <b>My answer to them was always NO!</b><br/></p>
<p>But, about
1 year ago one of those <b>BIG FUNDS MANAGERS </b>came to me with an unrefusable proposal and bought me the Cashmaker
Secret, with the condition to stop trade and broadcast the forex signal for free for
at least 12 months, so they can have an advantage over any other competitors
interested in copying Cashmaker trades to their clientes accounts.</p>
<p>Now that period of time ended, I decided to make Cashmaker Secrets available to all beginners
and small forex investors around the world at a fair and affordable price, so
everyone can have Cashmaker secret software making big profits into their forex
accounts.</p>
<p>A fair
price evaluation to Cashmaker full system is much above the 1000€, but it will
be sold to a target price of only 899€ retail price.</p>
<p>However, I want
to make it even more affordable to all small and even part-time forex investors, so
the final retail price should be much cheaper.</p>
<p>So, <b><u>the main goal of this campaign, is to get lower the retail price of Cashmaker
system to just 477€</u></b>, in order to allow thousands of inexperienced and small
forex investors like you and me, to have access to this secret trading tool to make
a good living from forex market.</p>

Cashmaker Summary - How it Started and How it’s Now!

Let’s
make short a long story!
The
story of Cashmaker started going back to 2008 when I did started to invest in the
currencies forex market, and like everybody else I was looking for some miraculous
thing to allows me to make big big money in a very short period of time
I
mean, I was looking for some “Get Rich Quick” forex tools… Get it?!
By that
time I haven’t any forex market trading experience.
The inexperience
result was that for the next 3 years I did invest and lost lots of money on
forex market. Then, in 2011 I did developed my own strategy based in a secret
that I have found in a meanwhile by myself. 
That
secret strategy is so effective that I have turned a $10.000 account into an
account over $550.000 in just 2½ years! Pretty
amazing, right?!... (check here full results report) 


Then, I
have shared those results for FREE with other small forex investors around the
world via mql5, becoming the most subscribed (#1) forex signal at that sharing
signals platform with over 1000 subscribers. (Here some followers screenshots)



(Do you
know … Through a free forex signals platform, all Cashmaker trades are copied directly
to subscribers trading accounts?)



Of course,
these kind of results attracted the attention of several forex brokers and big funds
managers around the world, so they have started asking me to tell them the Cashmaker Secret! My answer to them was always NO!
But, about
1 year ago one of those BIG FUNDS MANAGERS came to me with an unrefusable proposal and bought me the Cashmaker
Secret, with the condition to stop trade and broadcast the forex signal for free for
at least 12 months, so they can have an advantage over any other competitors
interested in copying Cashmaker trades to their clientes accounts.
Now that period of time ended, I decided to make Cashmaker Secrets available to all beginners
and small forex investors around the world at a fair and affordable price, so
everyone can have Cashmaker secret software making big profits into their forex
accounts.
A fair
price evaluation to Cashmaker full system is much above the 1000€, but it will
be sold to a target price of only 899€ retail price.
However, I want
to make it even more affordable to all small and even part-time forex investors, so
the final retail price should be much cheaper.
So, the main goal of this campaign, is to get lower the retail price of Cashmaker
system to just 477€, in order to allow thousands of inexperienced and small
forex investors like you and me, to have access to this secret trading tool to make
a good living from forex market.
By contributing
to Cashmaker Campaign, you are giving to all those small and inexperient investors
a chance to make their financial dreams come true, and you can also get the
Cashmaker full system before anyone else. (please, check the perks available on

Forex System does not manage Forex accounts and has no control over your
account. Past performance is not indicative of future results, as returns may
vary according to market conditions. Trading in foreign exchange is speculative
and may involve the loss of some or all of your principal. The use of leverage
can work against you as well as for you. While there is great potential for
reward in Forex trading, there is also significant risk of loss; therefore,
funds used for these systems should be risk capital funds that if lost will not
significantly affect one's personal financial well being. This is not a
solicitation to invest and you should carefully consider your financial
situation for suitability or discuss with a financial advisor prior to making
any investment. Cashmaker makes no consideration or is made toward your

results. No assurance can be given that the recommendations of Cashmaker will
be profitable or will not be subject to losses. All users should understand
that the results of a particular period will not necessarily be indicative of
results in future periods. The results listed at the recommended websites are
based on hypothetical trade results. Plainly speaking, these trades were not
actually executed. Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain
inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated trades do
not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been
executed, the results may have over or under compensated for the impact, if
any, of certain market factors such as lack of liquidity. You may have done
better or worse than the results portrayed. No representation is being made that
any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those
shown. No independent party has audited the hypothetical performance contained
at this website, nor has any independent party undertaken to confirm that they
reflect the trading method under the assumptions or conditions specified
hereafter. While the results presented at this website are based upon certain
assumptions believed to reflect actual trading conditions, these assumptions
may not include all variables that will affect, or have in the past affected,
the execution of trades indicated by Cashmaker. The simulation assumes purchase
and sale prices believed to be attainable. In actual trading, prices received
may or may not be the same as the assumed order prices. You expressly

Hypothetical trading programs in general are benefit of hindsight. No
representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve
profits or losses similar to those shown. Substantial risk is involved. Forex
trading has large potential rewards, but also large potential risk. You must be
aware of the risks and be willing to accept them in order to invest in the

<h2 style=""margin-left: 60px;""> </h2>
<p>We are looking to develop and market a new breed of social app. A transactional social app, where good deeds will be the currency. Here’s how we started…</p>
<p>My name is Irfan Khan, and I am the main driving force at Social Hero. I am 28 years old, and am expecting my first child later this year. The upcoming news of this new invitee in my life has inspired me to want to help and heal the world as best I can, in small, realistic, and achievable steps of course.   </p>
<p>I live a pretty normal life (if that’s what it’s called nowadays). I have a job, friends and family I care for and who care for me. I live in a normal fashion, in normal circumstances. Yet, I feel our generations (Older &amp; Younger), can do more. More for our community, more for our friends, more for our family, and more for our neighbours and fellow humans…..the only question is how?</p>
<p>I am also a realist and appreciate that the world will not change overnight, but some steps have to be taken to make and improve it as best we can. Not just for us, but for our children too, you know, we do have too at some point think about them</p>
<p>I have always been interested in technology and have a background in IT, as well as running previous businesses, and I am the biggest techno geek you will ever find. I think that best qualify me for this project... I think... :-)  I love technology, and I love the opportunities it can and will open for us and for our children.</p>
<p>I also believe the social media aspect of our life is going to be further intertwined and is only going to snowball into more and more usage, I don’t think this is something anyone can change, and I don’t think it should; this should be something that should not only be embraced, but utilised to do good. I wish to be at the forefront of using technology to help, and better lives that couldn’t happen before this social media age.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough about me.</p>
<p>Now…</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Our target is £30,000 to be able to really kick off the app development and most importantly the marketing. To spread the word, and really get people to back the idea. Once the app is developed, and certain traction is gained, we will be looking for large investment to really push the marketing forward. If this large sum can be achieved by Crowd funding than perfect, but realistically, we are after some capital to get things going</p>
<p>The app itself will require over 40 days’ worth of programming, and will come in at approx. £20000. To make sure the idea and the good deed spreads without technical hiccups, the app is designed to be extremely robust, and will go through thorough testing. The User interface will also be highly enhanced to allow for ease of use. Also we expect it to be very feature rich straight of the bat. Some of the features are below</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in with Facebook or Twitter</li>
<li>Create a profile in your HERO CHAMBER -which will have</li>
<ul>
<li>Your rank, this will be decided by points earned doing good deeds – like walking a neighbour’s dog, helping an old lady cross the road, saving someone’s life is extreme, but it can happen. At the start, there will be a lot of flexibility as to what we will score for ‘good deeds’</li>
<li>Your Badges, which are earned depending on your points, and also independent of them too. So if you did one huge good deed, it may warrant a badge on its own accord. Each badge then ahas a level within too.</li>
<li>You will be able to customise your hero avatar, using unique and varied costumes. As well as link your hero to your other social sites, Facebook, Twitter, and have images from there sync into the hero chamber.</li>
<li>You will also be able to share, and link all of yours, and your friends heroic deeds through Facebook and twitter</li>
<li>You will be able to create your own Superhero League, with your friends, or heroes who share the same location/interests/charities with you.</li>
<li>You will be able to create a neighbourhood league, allowing you and your community to use social network to help each other, like cut the lawn of a neighbour who’s broken his leg, or lend an wrench to one who has a leaking pipe. As well as alert your community if there has been any robberies recently. We are talking with some local community’s councils to see if we can also link in with them for the latest news in your town/city.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Request/or attend to a request</li>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to see all local quests set by other users</li>
<li>You will be able to set quests, so if you were moving and needed a hero to assist. Or a more simple, needed a light bulb replacing.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Charity Page</li>
<ul>
<li>You will be linked to charities that can collaborate with us, and have your score with them, the tasks you have done for them recently. As well as what the charity is doing, their latest statuses too.</li>
<li>Donating to charities will earn you points, and allow you to level up.</li>
<li>Gifts and vouchers are donated to us to give to ‘top hero of the week’, and ‘most valiant deed’</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>  </p>
<p>The above are not all the features, and there will be plenty more. We are also willing to listen to any additional features you may want. Though we can’t promise all of them, you know, no teleportation feature just yet.</p>
<p>The remaining amount will be used by marketing to launch the App, and to get as much celebrity endorsements as possible. </p>
<p>So this will be for social marketing, web page designs, and hiring of staff to lobby to the large number of celebrities on a lot of social media websites. </p>
<p>If the goal is not reached, we will use whatever sum that has been established to formulate a skeleton of the app, and release this to gain further traction within the market. This will allow for further investment once the app goes live, and real life figures and audiences can be reached. </p>

<h2>GOAL NOT REACHED</h2>
<p>If the goal is not reached, I will use whatever sum that has been established to formulate a skeleton of the app, and release this to gain further traction within the market. This will allow for further investment once the app goes live, and real life figures and audiences can be reached. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL YOU MAKE</h2>
<p>The motivation behind this app, is that there are millions and millions of us who are good people, we live by a certain ethical code, and we don’t wish harm to others, or ourselves. Yet were not actively doing well in the world. We may be too busy, too tired, too hard spent at work... there could be a million reasons, but for one reason or another, were not doing enough good in the world. And as the saying goes - Good Men not need do anything... for evil to succeed. </p>
<p>We want to see the good in the world, and we want the word to be a better place. We went the good people to do a little every now and again to make sure evil doesn’t succeed. </p>
<p>I’m not asking that the above people sell everything they have, move to a remote country and help the indigenous population discover clean water (although nothing is stopping you)</p>
<p>We want those people above to just do a good deed every now and again, and hopefully often enough to make it a habit. To smile at a stranger, to help an old lady cross the road, to volunteer at a local shelter, 5 min, 10 min, 10 hours, whatever you can do. And We for that person through the app will allow them to be recognised amongst their peers, and family, which will want them to do it again, and continue with this whole circle of 'Paying it Forward' and bringing good vibes to themselves and all around them. </p>
<p>We plan to get celebrities to help us promote the app, as well as give away gifts, memorabilia, tickets, etc. to entice the good deeds even further. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></h2>
<p>If you can’t contribute, don’t fear. The app will be released and will be free of charge. There all your good deeds can be counted and racked up. </p>
<p>But before it gets there, we need you to share, and mention, and like, until your blue in the face. Let’s get this out there, and let’s get this happening.</p>
<p>Wish us the best of luck!!! </p>

The User interface will also be highly enhanced to allow for ease of use. Also we expect it to be very feature rich straight of the bat. Some of the features are below

Sign in with Facebook or Twitter
Create a profile in your HERO CHAMBER -which will have

Your rank, this will be decided by points earned doing good deeds – like walking a neighbour’s dog, helping an old lady cross the road, saving someone’s life is extreme, but it can happen. At the start, there will be a lot of flexibility as to what we will score for ‘good deeds’
Your Badges, which are earned depending on your points, and also independent of them too. So if you did one huge good deed, it may warrant a badge on its own accord. Each badge then ahas a level within too.
You will be able to customise your hero avatar, using unique and varied costumes. As well as link your hero to your other social sites, Facebook, Twitter, and have images from there sync into the hero chamber.
You will also be able to share, and link all of yours, and your friends heroic deeds through Facebook and twitter
You will be able to create your own Superhero League, with your friends, or heroes who share the same location/interests/charities with you.
You will be able to create a neighbourhood league, allowing you and your community to use social network to help each other, like cut the lawn of a neighbour who’s broken his leg, or lend an wrench to one who has a leaking pipe. As well as alert your community if there has been any robberies recently. We are talking with some local community’s councils to see if we can also link in with them for the latest news in your town/city.


 

Request/or attend to a request

You will be able to see all local quests set by other users
You will be able to set quests, so if you were moving and needed a hero to assist. Or a more simple, needed a light bulb replacing.


 

Charity Page

You will be linked to charities that can collaborate with us, and have your score with them, the tasks you have done for them recently. As well as what the charity is doing, their latest statuses too.
Donating to charities will earn you points, and allow you to level up.
Gifts and vouchers are donated to us to give to ‘top hero of the week’, and ‘most valiant deed’


  
The above are not all the features, and there will be plenty more. We are also willing to listen to any additional features you may want. Though we can’t promise all of them, you know, no teleportation feature just yet.
The remaining amount will be used by marketing to launch the App, and to get as much celebrity endorsements as possible. 
So this will be for social marketing, web page designs, and hiring of staff to lobby to the large number of celebrities on a lot of social media websites. 
If the goal is not reached, we will use whatever sum that has been established to formulate a skeleton of the app, and release this to gain further traction within the market. This will allow for further investment once the app goes live, and real life figures and audiences can be reached.

GOAL NOT REACHED
If the goal is not reached, I will use whatever sum that has been established to formulate a skeleton of the app, and release this to gain further traction within the market. This will allow for further investment once the app goes live, and real life figures and audiences can be reached. 
 
WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL YOU MAKE
The motivation behind this app, is that there are millions and millions of us who are good people, we live by a certain ethical code, and we don’t wish harm to others, or ourselves. Yet were not actively doing well in the world. We may be too busy, too tired, too hard spent at work... there could be a million reasons, but for one reason or another, were not doing enough good in the world. And as the saying goes - Good Men not need do anything... for evil to succeed. 
We want to see the good in the world, and we want the word to be a better place. We went the good people to do a little every now and again to make sure evil doesn’t succeed. 
I’m not asking that the above people sell everything they have, move to a remote country and help the indigenous population discover clean water (although nothing is stopping you)
We want those people above to just do a good deed every now and again, and hopefully often enough to make it a habit. To smile at a stranger, to help an old lady cross the road, to volunteer at a local shelter, 5 min, 10 min, 10 hours, whatever you can do. And We for that person through the app will allow them to be recognised amongst their peers, and family, which will want them to do it again, and continue with this whole circle of 'Paying it Forward' and bringing good vibes to themselves and all around them. 
We plan to get celebrities to help us promote the app, as well as give away gifts, memorabilia, tickets, etc. to entice the good deeds even further. 
 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
If you can’t contribute, don’t fear. The app will be released and will be free of charge. There all your good deeds can be counted and racked up. 
But before it gets there, we need you to share, and mention, and like, until your blue in the face. Let’s get this out there, and let’s get this happening.
Wish us the best of luck!!!",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

As mentioned above, nearly 95% of factory workers have smartphones and use them every day. There is also an enormous manufacturing industry in Tijuana with over 200,000 industry employees and over 3,000 factories. Our app also requires a certain degree of literacy and in Tijuana literacy is nearly universal. There is currently a large labor shortage in Tijuana, creating a strong demand for recruiting and retainment services. In addition, there are enormous labor violations as Mexico's labor unions are known as ""Ghost Unions"" because they are paid for by the companies and thus have the businesses' interests in mind.

In the four months she worked there they had forced her to work overtime without being paid, health and safety inspections had been ignored, and a box fell from the top of a scaffolding, hitting her in the eye. The injury was substantial, and would eventually leave her left eye blind. The factory refused to pay for the surgery leading to increased damage, they tried to pay her a small sum to convince her to leave without having to fire her because they knew if they fired her she had legal precedence to sue. She eventually took the payment and is still blind in her left eye today.</p><p>Had Eva been able to look up the reviews of her factory before starting, she could have avoided this all together. Even if not, she could now write a review to tell all other workers to avoid this factory at all costs. In addition, Eva could have learned from our platform that they were illegally firing her and she could sue for both the surgery and greater severance pay. We could have then connected her directly to the local nonprofit in Tijuana that provides free legal services to factory workers. Once Eva had recovered from the surgery we could provide her with free online education to improve her chances of finding a better job.

An obsessive focus on finding and eliminating fraudulent reviews discussed further below, and 2.) creating so much value that the service is worthwhile with or without a few disgruntled comments. As long as we’re able to create value for the workers, we’ll then create value to factories that are hoping to hire them using our recruiting services.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Question: </strong>How do you stop fraud?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Fraud has been our priority since we started. We’ve studied other systems like Google Reviews, Yelp, and Trip Adviser to learn from their best practices and have found that the most effective method is community policing. Allow users to flag or downvote content that they believe to be inaccurate or fraudulent. We will also be using a “fingerprinting” method that only allows a single device to create a single account. A single account will only be allowed to post once every two weeks, limiting the attempts of fraudulent users to impact overall ratings. Lastly, reviews that are overly negative or overly positive are often fraudulent. We’ll use natural language processing to conduct a “sentiment analysis” which means we will see how positive and negative a post is and weight those comments lower in our ordering system. There will always be a certain amount of fraud, the key is to produce enough real content while diminishing fake content to create real value for our users.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Question: </strong>Do factory workers really use smartphones?</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Absolutely. In Tijuana, the data shows nearly 95% of industry workers have smartphones and our own customer interviews have verified that claim. Most industry workers use their smartphones for Facebook and Whatsapp and are already very familiar with downloading and using apps.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Since there are so many factory workers why do factories need recruiting?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> The turnover rate in many emerging markets is 9 - 10% of the entire workforce every month. While there may be plenty of potential employees, they are not afraid to leave a job every 3 - 4 months. This makes recruiting and retainment an absolute priority for many factories. We’ll be able to lower those costs and increase the time an employee stays at their job due to better talent matches.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Question: </strong>How will you keep your users anonymous?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> We understand that being open and honest about your working conditions in many emerging markets could be dangerous. Employees can be blacklisted from entire industries for speaking out. For this reason, many employees are concerned about sharing any information, with anyone. Initially, we will not collect any identifiable information. There will be no way to trace the profile an employee creates directly to an individual. Once we’ve gained the trust of workers, and they know we will keep their identity anonymous, we will allow workers to create personal profiles for work applications and gaining educational certificates.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Are you trying to help people or make money?</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Both. There's an ongoing belief that you either need to be a business that only cares about making money or a nonprofit that only cares about helping people. In reality, this distinction is rarely clear. Nonprofits often suffer from a few major flaws. They don't make enough profit, so they can't hire the most qualified people, and even if they do they can't keep them for long. This creates a very high turnover rate among nonprofit staff members and leadership. In addition, because their money often comes from donors they must focus on selling their impact to the donor to continually get funding. This means a great deal of time is spent on fundraising and finding ways to make their impact seem greater than it is rather than focusing on their beneficiaries. Alternatively, businesses must create a product their customers' value or they will go out of business. Every decision must be about how they're creating value for their customers. A business model also allows for scalability, increasing the opportunity for impact. That said, social issues often get overlooked in businesses due to the need for quarterly returns. We believe there is a way to combine these models, sell goods and make money by helping people. This will force us to constantly create value for our beneficiaries and focus on our social impact. For a more in-depth discussion of this topic, see our blog post <a href=""https://www.incentivizinggood.com/unseen-blog/2018/3/22/the-fatal-flaw-of-donor-driven-development"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p></div>","Our StoryFive years ago our CEO, Bryce Watson, lived in China and had the privilege to work with families that had moved to Beijing to find a job in a factory.

The factory refused to pay for the surgery leading to increased damage, they tried to pay her a small sum to convince her to leave without having to fire her because they knew if they fired her she had legal precedence to sue. She eventually took the payment and is still blind in her left eye today.Had Eva been able to look up the reviews of her factory before starting, she could have avoided this all together. Even if not, she could now write a review to tell all other workers to avoid this factory at all costs. In addition, Eva could have learned from our platform that they were illegally firing her and she could sue for both the surgery and greater severance pay. We could have then connected her directly to the local nonprofit in Tijuana that provides free legal services to factory workers. Once Eva had recovered from the surgery we could provide her with free online education to improve her chances of finding a better job. While we can’t solve all of Eva’s challenges, Vize would provide a great deal of support to help her overcome these immense obstacles. TimelineWe piloted the app in late May with a small group of users and received resoundingly positive feedback. Every user told us how useful our service would be for finding new jobs and importantly how willing they were to tell others about their experiences. Our CEO has decided to move to Tijuana for the next two months to manage a full launch in July and August.We have a goal of reaching 5,000 users by December. Selling 10 business subscriptions by the end of September and at least 30 job postings a month after that. By January our goal is to sell at least 21 monthly business subscriptions.  Our long-term goals are to launch in other Mexican cities within 12 months, including Ciudad Juarez. Once we have a stronghold in Mexico, we will most likely pursue markets in Asia with India, Vietnam, and Malaysia as top contenders. We will need to grow significantly before launching in China due to the government's aversion to open information. We also hope to provide other services, such as helping international buyers find socially responsible and trustworthy sourcing partners and help citizens in emerging markets participate in their government.  Our TeamOur team has a combination of computer science and international development experience that makes us uniquely qualified to bring this product to market. More importantly, four of our six team members have substantial experience living in emerging markets including China, Cameroon, India, and Colombia. We intimately understand the problem, and we have the skill set to deliver the solution. We're big believers in accountability, so you can check out our team below. Feel free to reach out to us directly and we'll get right back to you! Bryce WatsonCEO, Co-founderBryce had the initial idea for Vize after working in China for 8 months with factory workers in Beijing. For the last five years, he has worked with the private sector, government agencies, and nonprofits to build products and innovative business models for people in emerging markets. Now equipped with this experience he is prepared to pursue his initial passion with the rest of Vize's amazing team.Julian AlvarezLead Product Manager, Co-founderWith Vize, Julian is combining the three things he enjoys most in his professional life, business, entrepreneurship and computer programming. He has built an online eBay business that has generated more than a quarter million dollars in sales. This business experience has helped him better empathize with the end user of any product and use that insight in the technical development of a wide variety of projects including as the application developer at Swyft LLC and now as the Lead Product Manager and Co-founder of Vize. Krit GuptaSenior Software Developer, Co-founderPreviously the Senior Software Developer for NextSpace Technologies, and co-founder of the environmental non-profit GreenWings, Krit feels a profound connection with the issue of working conditions in emerging markets, having witnessed it throughout his adolescence while living in India. Krit will be bringing his experience of developing AI centered mobile apps and software bots to the team.Urel DjioganLead Software Developer, Co-founderUrel’s passion for making a difference in the world is the primary driver of his work. His experiences as Lead Software Developer for the Dwight Look College of Engineering at Texas A&M, and Project Manager of the Aggie Coding Club were vital for the development of Vize, providing him with a keen understanding of technological application as well as a nuanced outlook on our online generation. Where your Contributions GoAll of the money we receive from generous donors like yourself will go towards acquiring a strong foundation of initial users. Our CEO, Bryce Watson, has moved to Tijuana on his own dime and will use the money gathered here to find the best sales and marketing talent in Tijuana. The incredible development team has also decided to forgo the funds received in this campaign to ensure all of the money is used on customer acquisition. We plan that by the end of August we'll have gathered enough users to raise our seed round and use that money to expand into new markets and provide even more features for employees all over the world.  FAQQuestion: Won’t factories be upset that you’re letting factory workers post complaints openly?Answer: We have received some concerns from factories about the potential for disgruntled employees writing unhelpful reviews, so we’ve taken two approaches to solve this problem. 1.) An obsessive focus on finding and eliminating fraudulent reviews discussed further below, and 2.) creating so much value that the service is worthwhile with or without a few disgruntled comments. As long as we’re able to create value for the workers, we’ll then create value to factories that are hoping to hire them using our recruiting services. Question: How do you stop fraud?Answer: Fraud has been our priority since we started. We’ve studied other systems like Google Reviews, Yelp, and Trip Adviser to learn from their best practices and have found that the most effective method is community policing. Allow users to flag or downvote content that they believe to be inaccurate or fraudulent. We will also be using a “fingerprinting” method that only allows a single device to create a single account. A single account will only be allowed to post once every two weeks, limiting the attempts of fraudulent users to impact overall ratings. Lastly, reviews that are overly negative or overly positive are often fraudulent. We’ll use natural language processing to conduct a “sentiment analysis” which means we will see how positive and negative a post is and weight those comments lower in our ordering system. There will always be a certain amount of fraud, the key is to produce enough real content while diminishing fake content to create real value for our users. Question: Do factory workers really use smartphones?Answer: Absolutely. In Tijuana, the data shows nearly 95% of industry workers have smartphones and our own customer interviews have verified that claim. Most industry workers use their smartphones for Facebook and Whatsapp and are already very familiar with downloading and using apps. Question: Since there are so many factory workers why do factories need recruiting?Answer: The turnover rate in many emerging markets is 9 - 10% of the entire workforce every month. While there may be plenty of potential employees, they are not afraid to leave a job every 3 - 4 months. This makes recruiting and retainment an absolute priority for many factories. We’ll be able to lower those costs and increase the time an employee stays at their job due to better talent matches. Question: How will you keep your users anonymous?Answer: We understand that being open and honest about your working conditions in many emerging markets could be dangerous. Employees can be blacklisted from entire industries for speaking out. For this reason, many employees are concerned about sharing any information, with anyone. Initially, we will not collect any identifiable information. There will be no way to trace the profile an employee creates directly to an individual. Once we’ve gained the trust of workers, and they know we will keep their identity anonymous, we will allow workers to create personal profiles for work applications and gaining educational certificates. Question: Are you trying to help people or make money?Answer: Both. There's an ongoing belief that you either need to be a business that only cares about making money or a nonprofit that only cares about helping people. In reality, this distinction is rarely clear. Nonprofits often suffer from a few major flaws. They don't make enough profit, so they can't hire the most qualified people, and even if they do they can't keep them for long. This creates a very high turnover rate among nonprofit staff members and leadership. In addition, because their money often comes from donors they must focus on selling their impact to the donor to continually get funding. This means a great deal of time is spent on fundraising and finding ways to make their impact seem greater than it is rather than focusing on their beneficiaries. Alternatively, businesses must create a product their customers' value or they will go out of business. Every decision must be about how they're creating value for their customers. A business model also allows for scalability, increasing the opportunity for impact. That said, social issues often get overlooked in businesses due to the need for quarterly returns. We believe there is a way to combine these models, sell goods and make money by helping people. This will force us to constantly create value for our beneficiaries and focus on our social impact.

</div></div>","(Please see the Update and Gallery for the latest news update)Are you familiar with the New Uncia DLP 3D Printer? That's because we have done a successful project on Indiegogo early this year(see here) to help people know more about DLP 3D printer, and to provide a more pleasant user experience, we have upgraded our printer in aspects of both hardware and software. Now it's time for every one and schools to get involved and enjoy!We upgraded Uncia, because we never stop pursuing its perfection. However, improvements cost us more than what it used to be, and your contributions will help us manufacture this high quality product (using only the best components) in large quantities, therefore decreasing the cost of each individual unit. Only with a rather low price, 3D printers could truly be introduced into people's home to let every one experience the delight it brings. We think it cruel to see that people's creation  couldn't be realize, limited by the price of printers.Upgrade for UnciaSince our last successful project, we've been gathering feedback, suggestions and of course complaints =) from all our backers through mails and forums, which are the momentum for us to improve our products and service.HardwareUpgraded ProjectorWe have replaced our previous projector with a brand new one, and it is calibrated and fully automated, with which Uncia could provide excellent stable beam and high precision with the right settings. Longer product life could be achieved too by the improvement of the system.( See Updates for other suggested  models of the projector )More advanced unitsBody made of steel ensures your printer stay away form deformation caused by bumping. And also with absolutely secured packaging, there would be no worries about any damage to the printer. Our stepping motor is now manufactured in Germany with reliable quality, which enables Uncia to have a long-running operation. With the support from a top-level manufacturer in Taiwan, we have one of the best guide rails in the world to improve printing success rate significantly. We have also added a small equipment attached to the back to ensure the safety of electricity use.No more consumables!To all the users of DLP 3D printers, the most nerve-wracking problem they are facing is that some parts such as belts would easily go wrong, and these consumables situation will be put to an end. Learning from the feedback of our customers and reviews of other printer users, now we have our belts produced in Italy for you to leave all such troubles behind. SofwareWe use N3D Slicer & Snapshot, and they're easy to operate.  .STL files and even sliced PNG images can be processed.ServiceNoticing that all printer users have all kinds of problems during their printing, including materials, assembling, debugging, etc, we now provide more friendly service to our users.

Now the first round is finished. I thank all the people who bought a SUMPOD. I am waiting on some parts and expect the first machines to ship within the estimated lead time. I will contact when each SUMPOD is ready for dispatch.Thanks again for your supportRichard UPDATE 24/07/2011The newly designed website is live at SUMPOD.COM. It has a forum for all and news posts. UPDATE 08/07/2011 I have now started a website at SUMPOD.COM. Over the next week I will be adding videos, a blog and a forum. What is SUMPOD?My aim in designing the SUMPOD was to produce a product which not only makes the technology affordable and hence accessible but has the safety of the user at the forefront. That aim has been met with the SUMPOD. You may ask why a home 3d printer is necessary. My view is that like the inkjet printer which turned a lot of people into photographers and desktop publishers, a 3d printer will reignite our need to invent, design and construct with the end result being a rebirth of manufacturing. Anyone of any age will have the ability to have an idea and see it through from conception to manufacture. Home manufacture. It could also reduce the amount of waste by giving the user the ability to fix broken plastic parts, by designing and printing replacements.It is not necessary to design objects as there are multitudes of designs available for free on-line which can be downloaded and printed using the available software.BUILD QUALITYThe units are built using precision cut CNC parts using 18mm MDF, for strength, with axis which run on quality linear bearings and are driven by quality steel reinforced belts and trapezoidal spindles for smooth motion. The motors are high torque Nema 17s which are the best compromise between size, weight and power.The extruder is based on the tried and tested wade extruder with an aluminium block hot end. The machines will have a build area of 150mm by 150mm by 100mm with an overall size of 280*350*280.There is a lcd display which is used to display temperature and will allow future developments such as a SD card standalone functionality.All these components and design choices ensure that the machine will be long lasting, accurate and safe.ACCESSORIES A Dremel attachment for PCBs and light routing, such as lithopanes, is to be included with the kit. PARTICIPATIONYour participation will ensure that you are one of the first to have a SUMPOD. Complete instruction on the assembly and use of the machine will be provided along with the access to a forum and site which will be unveiled at the time of the first shipments.The SUMPODs will be made and dispatched in the order of the contributions received. The time from contribution to shipping will be between six to eight weeks. There are THREE levels of participation:$400+p&p :A MDF KIT excluding electronics but including motors.$500+ p&p  :A MDF KIT including all electronics( these are of medium complexitybut use through hole components).$600 + p&p :A MDF KIT with fully soldered electronics ready to use.The MDF is supplied in the natural colour.

<p>Recently, <span>LiDAR sensors </span>have been widely used in various industries such as automobile, archaeology, geography, agriculture, and more. The main purpose is for making high-resolution maps.</p>
<p>The most common example, autonomous cars, also use<span> LiDAR</span> for their control and navigation systems. Unfortunately, the price of highly accurate LiDAR sensors is very high, often thousands of dollars which puts this useful technology out of reach for many.</p>

The main purpose is for making high-resolution maps.
The most common example, autonomous cars, also use LiDAR for their control and navigation systems. Unfortunately, the price of highly accurate LiDAR sensors is very high, often thousands of dollars which puts this useful technology out of reach for many.
It’s time for us, the LDROBOT Group, to disrupt this industry and make LiDAR accessible to everyone!

 

 
LD-AIR LiDAR offers high accuracy sensing capability TOF LiDAR sensors to everyone at an affordable price starting from $130.
Using advanced technology, the TOF sensor in LD-AIR LiDAR is a highly accurate with 360° scanning range for precise scanning results every time. 

 

Time of Flight Measurement​

​

 
Compared to other traditional laser scanners, LD-AIR LiDAR utilizes the Time of Flight technique to detect distance precisely within a 12 meters radius range. It emits an infrared laser forward and then the laser is reflected back into the single-photon receiving unit after encountering the target object. The gap between the time of laser emitting and receiving is the time of flight.
 
360° Omnidirectional Scanning Range
​​

 
With its 360° rotation range, LD-AIR LiDAR can sense the surrounding environment with no dead corners to actualize obstacle detection and autonomously map any area. 

Collects Samples 4500 Times per Second​

 

 
For sample frequency, it can measure up to 4500 samples of laser ranging per second with high rotation speed which greatly increases the mapping speed.
 

 
DIY Autonomous Robot
​

 
LD-AIR LiDAR takes your creative robot projects such as drones and self-driving cars to the next level, making them smarter and more useful. It can be practically used to sense the environment and avoid obstacles. By detecting the absolute positions of objects, it enables your drone to do autonomous mapping and navigation. 
Software Support
​

For creative makers, you can use LD-AIR LiDAR in your projects with software development kits like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Javascript, and other specialized robotic operating systems.
 
 Digital Art - Multimedia Interactive Projection 
 

 
Using a whiteboard or poster to present an idea or communicate with an audience is typical. But with LD-AIR LiDAR, it can be done better. LD-AIR LiDAR allows you to create a cutting-edge multimedia interactive projection on the wall, ground, large screen, or desktop which can add interest to the content and strengthen learning and communication to enhance the overall experience. 
Algorithm Verification
​

 
LD-AIR LiDAR also can be used for conducting experiments that help to test the validation of an algorithm for specific purposes. Born To Be Practical
​

 
LD-AIR LiDAR is built to serve business and research purposes that require robot navigation and obstacle avoidance. If you are a robot developer or robotic engineering researcher, this essential component makes your robots more useful and intelligent at an affordable price. Robot ROS teaching and research
​
 Home Security
​

 
Like a motion detector, LD-AIR LiDAR is able to detect motion changes in a room with high sensitivity. Because of this ability, you can use it to create a home security system that will sense anything interrupting a particular area. It can sense when someone walks through a doorway or tries to move the objects in a room, and can be used to track people’s movement.  Environmental Scan and 3D Mapping
​
 
Vacuum Robots​

 

 

 
Acting as ‘the eyes’ of vacuum robots, LD-AIR LiDAR is designed to be invisible and it is small enough to be completely contained within the body of the robot without any external housing. This way, vacuum robots can remain low-profile to move freely under and around furniture more easily. Service Robots
​

 
Based on its functions of autonomous mapping and obstacle avoidance, LD-AIR LiDAR can be applied to the design of working service robots for tasks such as route setting and automatic responsive behaviors. Its mission is to make your robots more intelligent. 
 

 
Equipped with a brushless motor, LD-AIR LiDAR reduces the mechanical friction while operating so it runs more smoothly without loud noises. More importantly, this brushless motor provides an extended lifespan, reaching more than 10000+ hours, which is 10 times longer than other laser sensors. Therefore, it requires low maintenance and fewer replacements for any applications equipped with LD-AIR LiDAR.
 

 
Water & Dust Proof
 

 
The new bottom case design empowers LD-AIR LiDAR with water and dust resistance that allows it to run perfectly in any condition (*The surface needs to be maintained clean in actual use.). 
Outdoor And Indoor Adaptability
​

 
With anti-ambient light 30 Klux resistance, it can always maintain its high-accuracy performance under any circumstances with no limitations.
 

 
LD-AIR LiDAR is a Ready-To-Use compliant laser sensor that is small and versatile enough to fit in any appliance. Ultra-thin and Ultra-light
 

 

 

 

 

 
Certified FDA Class 1 Laser Safety Standard, LD-AIR LiDAR adopts the low-power infrared laser light as its light source and drives it by using a modulated pulse, ensuring both effectiveness and safety. Creating no harm to the eyes of humans and pets.

The way they are created together and inform each other is something extraordinary for both the creators and users. 

  
 Like we said before, any contribution helps, but if you are looking for a way to donate beyond what can be given monetarily, we appreciate any other way you may be able to help us make this happen. Here are some ideas: 
Share our page! Please, please, please help us spread the word about Home Baked and get our project idea out there and reach others who may be interested in what we are doing. 
If you have access to supplies that you feel may benefit our production process like papers, screen printing ink, sticker printing, etc... donations of these supplies are also incredibly useful and appreciated. 
Feel free to contact any of the team members and students listed, involved in this project, to ask them directly what they may need help with. We have distributed the work that goes into this project throughout the class, so that each of us have different roles.  

Thank you in advance for you generous support!",8.0,3,"1 Campaign

I felt disappointed for having bad quality and precise in making good shape with a beautiful end results..</p><p>And after searching, spending &amp; experimenting over 2000 hours looking for good machine and compare prices, I decided to build my own machine using either DLP or SLA technology, so after experimenting and testing it in my lab, finally.. my dream of having high resolution printer comes to life!</p><p>Therefore, I'd loved to share with everybody in this world my experience in putting my machines between everyone's hand to in order to share it with your friends &amp; colleagues..</p><p>Today..</p><p>I came up with ""<b>The""</b> most affordable, fastest, cheapest, precise, open source DLP 3D printer at your place where ever you are, with the best price <b>ever</b> comparing with other big Brands in this industry..</p><p><br/></p><h1>Why DLP Technology?</h1><p>Simply.. FDM technology can not match high resolution or speed running with DLP or SLA tech, beside some facts:</p><p>1. I was looking for a big challenge to reach <strong>50 micron</strong> layer thickness even less, with larger printing bed I can reach.. and I did, and it is True!</p><p>2. To bring 3D printing technology into <strong>everyone's home..</strong> True!</p><p>3. To build a quality and affordable 3D printer that everyone can <strong>enjoy!</strong> True!</p><p>4. I want this technology to be available to everyone at great and <strong>affordable price!</strong>.. True!</p><p>5. Assembling and using the 3D printer should be also <strong>easy to use with minimal efforts</strong>.. True!</p><p>6. <strong>C</strong><strong>hallenge many big Brands</strong> in this industry, True!</p><p>So, lets take a look on the technical comparison:</p><p><br/></p><h1><strong>Why my Project Matters</strong></h1><p>Many prominent people believe 3D printing technology is not ready for the home. I respectfully disagree. When you help me to succeed, you are helping to bring this technology to everyone at a price that is easily affordable.</p><p>My reason for starting this project is simple: there are no low-cost 3D printers that meet the quality standards of the professional designer. As researchers at the MIT Media Lab, I was lucky to experience the best and most expensive fabrication equipment in the world. But, I became frustrated by the fact that all the professional-quality 3D printers were ridiculously expensive (read: tens of thousands of dollars) and were so complex to use. In 2013, I decided to build a solution to this problem myself, and I am now ready to share it with the world.</p><p>See the comparison below with other Brands!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/332771/files/20140127110805-Comparison.JPG?1390849685"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>

I felt disappointed for having bad quality and precise in making good shape with a beautiful end results..And after searching, spending & experimenting over 2000 hours looking for good machine and compare prices, I decided to build my own machine using either DLP or SLA technology, so after experimenting and testing it in my lab, finally.. my dream of having high resolution printer comes to life!Therefore, I'd loved to share with everybody in this world my experience in putting my machines between everyone's hand to in order to share it with your friends & colleagues..Today..I came up with ""The"" most affordable, fastest, cheapest, precise, open source DLP 3D printer at your place where ever you are, with the best price ever comparing with other big Brands in this industry..Why DLP Technology?Simply.. FDM technology can not match high resolution or speed running with DLP or SLA tech, beside some facts:1. I was looking for a big challenge to reach 50 micron layer thickness even less, with larger printing bed I can reach.. and I did, and it is True!2. To bring 3D printing technology into everyone's home.. True!3. To build a quality and affordable 3D printer that everyone can enjoy! True!4. I want this technology to be available to everyone at great and affordable price!.. True!5. Assembling and using the 3D printer should be also easy to use with minimal efforts.. True!6. Challenge many big Brands in this industry, True!So, lets take a look on the technical comparison:Why my Project MattersMany prominent people believe 3D printing technology is not ready for the home. I respectfully disagree. When you help me to succeed, you are helping to bring this technology to everyone at a price that is easily affordable.My reason for starting this project is simple: there are no low-cost 3D printers that meet the quality standards of the professional designer. As researchers at the MIT Media Lab, I was lucky to experience the best and most expensive fabrication equipment in the world. But, I became frustrated by the fact that all the professional-quality 3D printers were ridiculously expensive (read: tens of thousands of dollars) and were so complex to use. In 2013, I decided to build a solution to this problem myself, and I am now ready to share it with the world.See the comparison below with other Brands!

<h2>Rotio® Compass.</h2>
<p><strong>Simple but intuitive</strong></p>
<p>The most simple and intuitive design tool to complement natural creativity and add a new layer to the design process.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526664421/cobfqbx7yn5l1ihzi4qq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Story.</strong></h3>
<p>The Rotio Compass was created by two professional industrial designers after noticing how many people are reluctant to draw and express their creativity through fear of being judged. </p>
<p>‘Part of this issue is that the bar has been set so high, people don’t have the confidence to draw’. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/1nQH3mIbXVs5Fhrd0z/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our aim is to encourage more people to be creative. </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526752948/kev8vsscfsjst1qb0md6.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>

<h3>Two sizes. Two colours. </h3>
<p>Introducing the Rotio Standard and the Rotio Plus compass.</p>
<p>Both size compass are available in black or silver finish, we'll contact you after the campaign for your choice.</p>
<p>The holes are spaced at 5mm radius increments and has a circle range of ⌀40mm to ⌀140mm for the standard size and to ⌀40mm to ⌀200mm for the plus size. </p>
<p>The proportions were developed around the standard A4 paper size. The largest circle of the Plus size fits within the width of an A4 paper sheet.</p>
<p>Undecided on which size? Most designers prefer the Rotio Set, one of each size.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The final prototypes have been made by the chosen manufacturer, we are ready for production.</p>
<p>The Rotio Compass has been entered into design awards:</p>

<h3>Why the Rotio® Compass is not just another compass.</h3>
<p><strong>1. Precise and considered design.</strong> We have worked hard to create an intuitive and efficient design tool that gives a completely new drawing experience. Simply place on the page, your finger on the centre and rotate with a pen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/2vs3E2WEZ06nn35VgM/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>2. Designed to last. </strong>The body and centre are machined from aluminium making the compass is tough and robust. While the cartridge bearing at the centre allows for smooth and accurate arcs, curves and circles. The evenly spaced holes while won't suit all, has been sized to accommodate a range of pens and pencils.</p>

</div></div>","Rotio® Compass.
Simple but intuitive
The most simple and intuitive design tool to complement natural creativity and add a new layer to the design process.  

Story.
The Rotio Compass was created by two professional industrial designers after noticing how many people are reluctant to draw and express their creativity through fear of being judged. 
‘Part of this issue is that the bar has been set so high, people don’t have the confidence to draw’. 

Our aim is to encourage more people to be creative. 


Two sizes. Two colours. 
Introducing the Rotio Standard and the Rotio Plus compass.
Both size compass are available in black or silver finish, we'll contact you after the campaign for your choice.
The holes are spaced at 5mm radius increments and has a circle range of ⌀40mm to ⌀140mm for the standard size and to ⌀40mm to ⌀200mm for the plus size. 
The proportions were developed around the standard A4 paper size. The largest circle of the Plus size fits within the width of an A4 paper sheet.
Undecided on which size? Most designers prefer the Rotio Set, one of each size.

 
The final prototypes have been made by the chosen manufacturer, we are ready for production.
The Rotio Compass has been entered into design awards:


Why the Rotio® Compass is not just another compass.
1. Precise and considered design. We have worked hard to create an intuitive and efficient design tool that gives a completely new drawing experience. Simply place on the page, your finger on the centre and rotate with a pen.

2. Designed to last. The body and centre are machined from aluminium making the compass is tough and robust. While the cartridge bearing at the centre allows for smooth and accurate arcs, curves and circles. The evenly spaced holes while won't suit all, has been sized to accommodate a range of pens and pencils.

3. Built for control and accuracy. While other compasses can be hard to use, the Rotio Compass has a stable base for accurate and defined line work. With greater control over the pen, the Rotio Compass allows you to go over and vary the line weight for greater depth and contrast to your sketching. Compared to a traditional compass, drawing full circles using the Rotio Compass is much easier, particularly for younger users. 

4. Leave no mark. As the Rotio Compass has no sharp point, it grips the page using a concealed nitrile o-ring. There are no marks or unsightly damage on the page leaving your work pristine.

5. Accurate line up. The hole in the centre is sized to make it easy to line up on specific points.

SummaryAround 7% of the world's population is color-blind. This Intel International Science and Engineering Fair research project is based on color compensation algorithms and techniques that improve images for color-blind viewers. About Me
I'm Animesh, 17, a grade 12 student from New Delhi, India. Over the last two years, I have been working on a research project that aims to optimize images, videos, websites and other visual content for color-blind viewers using image-processing algorithms. This research explores four image optimization algorithms with several permutations of color-correction techniques, and aims to determine the best color-correction process.  
                  
In June 2013, this research won recognition when I was selected as a Regional Finalist at the Google Global Science Fair. After working throughout my senior year to bring this project to the Intel ISEF, I have been selected to represent India at the international-level fair in May 2014 at Los Angeles, California.The Constraints1) In order to extend my research, prove the effectiveness of the algorithms, and determine the most efficient algorithm, I need to test it on a sufficiently large sample set. While I have tested the algorithms with several people in my community, finding a mobilized group of color-blind viewers has been difficult. However, by leveraging the power of crowdsourcing and the Internet, I can obtain responses to a survey by presenting images optimized using four novel algorithms to color-blind viewers. A larger sample size would lead to increased credibility and a stronger basis for this research. Amazon MechTurks and a social-media application are currently top choices for these surveys.2) I have currently been using unlicensed software. However, for the international level fair, I have been instructed to purchase licensed copies of MATLAB, Mathematica and other digital image processing toolkits that I am using in my research.3) I am currently using my own web-server that has several bandwidth and speed constraints. As a result, even relatively simple computations take upto 10 seconds of processing time. In order to develop a scalable and universal application for improving images, I need to use Amazon Web Services or an equivalent host that is capable of handling a multitude of image processing requests at any given time. With sufficient data and the right platform, I believe this project could immensely benefit the color-blind community. Over the next few years, with calibration and improvements, these optimization algorithms could find their way into devices as software-based accessibility features. The Campaign
Amazon MechTurks is a crowdsourcing marketplace where real people perform surveys and other HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) to earn rewards of the order of 1 or 2 cents for each task. This platform can be leveraged to find color-blind people and test them for color-blindness, allowing them to determine the best perceivable images from a variety of samples generated using the enhancement algorithms.
More funds would lead to more volunteers for the color-blindness tests. During manual surveys, only one in every twelve volunteers was diagnosed with color blindness. Thus, one volunteer would not translate to one sample at most times, and a significant number of people would need to be tested before a sufficient data set is created.
A portion of the funds would be used to buy licenses and hosting for the project source code. This is an important step before the project can be exhibited at the international level.
I am still a high school student, so I cannot offer a lot of fancy rewards, but I would like to show my appreciation in the following ways:
For contributions upto $25, the contributors names would be listed on the acknowledgements in my project report at the Intel ISEF.
For contributions upto $50, the contributors would receive an additional handwritten Thank You card from me in addition to the above.
For contributions upto $100, the contributors names would receive a special acknowledgement on the project's webpage in addition to the above rewards.
For contributions upto $500, the contributors names would be mentioned on my main project panel at the Intel ISEF.
The Impact,The motivation behind this project was to help color-blind people perceive information that they would otherwise be missing. Color-blindness is often left undetected, and even when detected, people rarely visit doctors for this condition. During the course of my research, I visited several blind schools, ophthalmologists and vision centers, but I could never gather information about people suffering from color-blindness. I then used simulation algorithms to predict the most effective methods for color compensation for color-blind viewers.Testing can corroborate the findings and developments of my research, and a proven algorithm could then be used as the norm for color-correction. This feature could then be built into any device - phones, tablets, desktops, billboards - every element with a visual or digital aspect would benefit from this research.With your help, I can substantiate this research and present a viable solution for the millions of color blind viewers across the world.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease help share this campaign so I can gather more support for the research!Note: All logos used above are copyrights of their respective owners.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The chemical BPA (Bisphenol A) has been linked to a variety of health diseases including diabetes and cancer. Two separate studies showed BPA found in 96% of adults and 91% of pregnant women tested in the United States. BPA has already been banned by the FDA (Federal Disease Agency) from some products like baby bottles and children's drinking cups. It is still found however in beverage bottles, lining of food products, and our sales receipts. </p>
<p><span>Voucher is committed to a safer alternative and we will supply retailers who use our printers with BPA-free paper for cash transactions.</span>    </p></span><p></p>

<h1><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">                            The Voucher Story</span></h1>""<i>Voucher began as a solution to a problem I had during my senior year of undergrad. I was very busy with classes and I frequently ate out. As a result, my car often accumulated piles of receipts that I would have to clean out about once every week. One particular day, I was disposing of my receipts at a gas station and noticed another student, a few pumps over, doing the same thing. I thought about how many people overlook their receipts and set them aside as waste. I went to the internet to see just exactly what the numbers were and I saw that as a nation, the US consumes around 640,000 tons of thermal paper annually. I thought there was a better, more sustainable solution, so I dedicated myself to figuring it out.</i>"" - <b>Kenneth Mack, Co-Founder</b>
</div>
<div>It took several months to architect a method for delivering a digital receipt directly from the retailer to the customer. After a number of attempts and failures, we finally developed a method including custom hardware, firmware, and a mobile application that leveraged open source APIs. </div>
<div>Once the patent was filed for the method and the apparatus, work began on the prototype and now we are raising seed-funding to continue growing our company! </div>

<p><br/></p>

<p>The design for the Voucher printer is centered around the TI CC3200, the newest WiFi microcontroller from Texas Instruments. These ICs are currently on the forefront of the IoT (Internet of Things) industry . </p>

We appreciate donations of any amount and sincerely thank you for helping make this happen for us!</span></div>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<div>Q: <b>Can I use the Voucher app to return an item?</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>Yes, the receipt on your app will be valid for returns.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Q: <b>How long will the receipts be stored in the app?</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>There will be options to customize how long you'd like to store a particular receipt. All receipts will be kept for entirety that they are valid unless chosen otherwise by the user.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Q: <b>If I already get my receipts emailed to me, why do we need Voucher?</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>Voucher is a system to store all of your receipts. The goal is to be global, where the majority of credit and debit card transactions result in a Voucher receipt.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Q: <b>How does Voucher work when customer pays with cash?</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>The first iteration of our product, unfortunately, will not support digital receipts for cash payments.

More about the project:












 










The chemical BPA (Bisphenol A) has been linked to a variety of health diseases including diabetes and cancer. Two separate studies showed BPA found in 96% of adults and 91% of pregnant women tested in the United States. BPA has already been banned by the FDA (Federal Disease Agency) from some products like baby bottles and children's drinking cups. It is still found however in beverage bottles, lining of food products, and our sales receipts. 
Voucher is committed to a safer alternative and we will supply retailers who use our printers with BPA-free paper for cash transactions.    

                            The Voucher Story""Voucher began as a solution to a problem I had during my senior year of undergrad. I was very busy with classes and I frequently ate out. As a result, my car often accumulated piles of receipts that I would have to clean out about once every week. One particular day, I was disposing of my receipts at a gas station and noticed another student, a few pumps over, doing the same thing. I thought about how many people overlook their receipts and set them aside as waste. I went to the internet to see just exactly what the numbers were and I saw that as a nation, the US consumes around 640,000 tons of thermal paper annually. I thought there was a better, more sustainable solution, so I dedicated myself to figuring it out."" - Kenneth Mack, Co-Founder

It took several months to architect a method for delivering a digital receipt directly from the retailer to the customer. After a number of attempts and failures, we finally developed a method including custom hardware, firmware, and a mobile application that leveraged open source APIs. 
Once the patent was filed for the method and the apparatus, work began on the prototype and now we are raising seed-funding to continue growing our company! 



                   Peek into our design process





The design for the Voucher printer is centered around the TI CC3200, the newest WiFi microcontroller from Texas Instruments. These ICs are currently on the forefront of the IoT (Internet of Things) industry . 






                                We need you
Currently we've spent about 8 months and $2,000 of our own money developing the architecture for Voucher, obtaining a provisional patent and beginning work on the backend of the mobile app. We are currently raising seed-funding to continue growing our company. With your help, here is what our future looks like:

Perks
Our perks for your donations involve a mix of merchandise, say in future product development, and efforts the team can take to continue preserving natural resources.  We are untraditional in that we are unfortunately unable to offer our printer as a perk as it is designed for use in a retail environment. We appreciate donations of any amount and sincerely thank you for helping make this happen for us!

FAQ
Q: Can I use the Voucher app to return an item?Yes, the receipt on your app will be valid for returns.

Q: How long will the receipts be stored in the app?There will be options to customize how long you'd like to store a particular receipt. All receipts will be kept for entirety that they are valid unless chosen otherwise by the user.

Q: If I already get my receipts emailed to me, why do we need Voucher?Voucher is a system to store all of your receipts. The goal is to be global, where the majority of credit and debit card transactions result in a Voucher receipt.

Q: How does Voucher work when customer pays with cash?The first iteration of our product, unfortunately, will not support digital receipts for cash payments. However, it is our business model to supply our contracted retailers with non-BPA paper to stay carcinogen free.

<p><em>How would your life or their life be different if that bad situation had never happened?</em></p>

Please join the </strong><strong>TRUTH REVOLUTION </strong><strong>by contributing today. </strong></p>
<p>My name is Mark Hunter, one of the co-founders of <a href=""http://TruthSerum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TruthSerum.com</a>.  I have known many people in my life who have been lied to or cheated on.  I have  known people who have been physically or emotionally abused and this has been difficult to witness. </p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: When you first meet someone, or even if you have known someone for a long time, you don't always know the real person behind the face.  Even as you get to know them better, there are hidden traits within each of us...some more scary than others.  Many people meet others either on social media (FaceBook, Twitter, etc.) or on dating sites...but the reality is that people do NOT fully present their true self on these sites. Even if you meet someone in person at a club, bar, school, work, or any other social setting; you don't really know if they will be truthful, loyal and kind; or a liar, cheater, or worse.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> I have partnered with scientists who specialize in linguistics and predictive analytics. We not only have the ability to to reveal personality traits...but also predict behaviors a person may manifest. <strong><em>THAT'S RIGHT,</em></strong> <strong><em>WE CAN PREDICT HUMAN BEHAVIOR. </em></strong>The cool thing about our process is that we can do this discretely, without requiring someone to complete lengthy psychometric assessments. We have already built an online tool (<a href=""http://www.truthserum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.truthserum.com</a>) that analyzes social media and can tell you a person's true personality.</p>

<h1>What we have done</h1>
<p><a href=""http://www.truthserum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TruthSerum.com</a> utilizes a revolutionary, patent pending, analytical process that infers personality and behavioral characteristics of an individual from their own social network activity. No need to complete lengthy assessment forms or answer confusing questions, the “true you” has already been subconsciously encoded in your social network activity.</p>
<p>Just as a messy desk, a loud voice or a polished resume reveal subtle aspects of an individual’s personality, so too does social network activity. The things you say about yourself, the language you use, the photos you post and the pages you “like” all reveal aspects of your personality. The same is true of your friends and associates; there is much that can be learned simply by analyzing the information already made public.</p>
<p>Once you grant us permission to access your social network data our patent pending Personality Engine goes to work collecting and analyzing information from your profiles, posts, comments and tweets to create a multidimensional personality profile. Each profile is a unique snapshot of the traits and characteristics that make you, you. While the Personality Engine finishes gathering data from your social networks we will ask you few questions about your life. These life outcome questions help improve the Personality Engine’s inferences about you and others. The more it learns the better it can predict.</p>
<p>We need help from Indiegogo contributors like you to develop a standalone mobile app that will allow you to analyze virtually any text on your phone, whether it be social media, emails or text messages to reveal the underlying personality characteristics of the author.  <strong> (Please, if you are not able to help out financially, please help us by sending this to all your friends so the TRUTH REVOLUTION will go viral.) </strong></p>

<p><span><strong>Founded</strong> in the heart of Silicon Valley, Petzila cofounders Simon Milner and Dave Clark both recognized the benefits of technology but realized how little technology there was related to something they both loved, their pets!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>One night</strong> while out to dinner chatting and sharing pictures from their smartphones they inevitably came across pictures of their pets. Next thing they knew everyone wanted to see, even total strangers. Simon turned to Dave and said, ""Ya know, why can’t we introduce our pets live and in real time with our smartphones?""</span></p>
<p><span>The wheels started turning ...</span></p>

About Us
 
Founded in the heart of Silicon Valley, Petzila cofounders Simon Milner and Dave Clark both recognized the benefits of technology but realized how little technology there was related to something they both loved, their pets!
One night while out to dinner chatting and sharing pictures from their smartphones they inevitably came across pictures of their pets. Next thing they knew everyone wanted to see, even total strangers. Simon turned to Dave and said, ""Ya know, why can’t we introduce our pets live and in real time with our smartphones?""
The wheels started turning ...
Both being veterans of companies large and small, new and old, public and private and both having brought products from concept to market that millions are currently enjoying today, it was a good question!
They were shocked when they searched for existing solutions and found none, with the exception of the larger home security offerings touting the ability to check on your pet, which they thought was great if you were watching the video stream while your pet walked by. But where was the interactive joy in that?
There had to be a way to get their pets on the net and create a truly interactive experience with a reward, a moment of joy? 
They thought...Heck if Pavlov could do it with a treat, why couldn’t we?
Many long conversations and lots of research later they both took the leap and committed full time to launcing the pet-tech revolution and creating what is now Petzila.
As an aside, the first night that Dave took home the PetziConnect initial prototype, not only did his dogs respond exactly as expected to his girlfriends voice (their real master) but upon receiving the dispensed treat the dogs were immediately hooked. Zero learning curve. 
Unfortunately, upstairs Dave’s girlfriend took to the experience equally as enthusiastically. Dave literally had to go downstairs and unplug the device so that he and the dogs could get some sleep as her phone battery was showing no signs of running out. That night one of the dogs actually slept downstairs by the unit:-)
The result of over 24 months of research and development is PetziConnect - the first salvo in the pet-tech revolution and just the beginning of the vision that is Petzila.

Most of the printers on the market today use the bottom-up architecture. Unfortunately there is a significant peeling force after every cured layer, making these type of printers slower and less reliable.</p><p>These forces act not only on the printed objects but on the vat coating as well, limiting its lifetime. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513777058/jjqedysmfxmmznlhnvyl.png"" src=""""/></p><p>By choosing a <strong>top-down architecture</strong> we eliminated the problems with resin vats failing mid-print while making the overall construction simpler, therefore more reliable. The obvious downside of this approach is that you have to fill the whole tank to a fixed level, regardless of printed object size.</p><p>We solved this by filling most of the tank with <strong>glycerine</strong>, and only adding resin onto the top of it. Glycerine is much denser than resin and won't mix with it, while being completely non toxic and inert. As an added bonus it's water-clear so regardless of the chosen resin's opacity you can see the built object through the glycerine while printing.</p><p> </p><h3>Magnetic build platform</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://3devised.com/indiegogo/05-magnetic-build-platform.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>After the print is completed you should be able to easily exctract your printed object. No tools needed, just pop the magnetic build platform out of the machine and you can immediately add a clean one to start a new print.</p><p>Handling the printed object together with the build platform makes cleaning and post curing much easier.</p><p> </p><h3>German precision - provided by IGUS®</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://3devised.com/indiegogo/06-igus.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>We wanted to make the Z axis as rigid and compact as possible. By placing it directly into the tank, we made the distance between the build platform and the leadscrew shorter, ensuring precision.  <br/>However this design decision came with its own problems. Added lubrication for the components (leadscrew nut, linear bearing) is out of the question, since it could contaminate the resin. </p><p>Choosing plastic bearing and nut components, as opposed to metal, was an obvious solution - but during development, we ran into a lot of dead ends. Commonly used plastics are not compatible with stereolithography resins, which results in swelling, distortion and eventually complete mechanical failure.</p><p>Here is when <a href=""http://www.igus.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">igus®</a> came to the rescue. They are the world leader in engineered plastic bearing materials and could supply us with the highest precision leadscrews, nuts, bearings and linear guides.

You only need to unbox PLUTO, plug in the power supply and fill the tank with the resin. After you launch 3Deviser the printer will be automatically detected and you are ready to go! Wireless connectivityWe also dislike unnecessary cables (we had enough of them during developing the first prototypes). PLUTO has a built-in WiFi module and it can connect to your existing network or create it's own. 3Deviser automatically detects every PLUTO connected to the WiFi. Open SourceWe have used a lot of open source and free software during the development of PLUTO and we would like to give back something in return. 3Deviser, PLUTO's firmwares and it's schematics will be published on GitHub. While PLUTO and it's softwares are quite capable in their current state we think that opening PLUTO up will enable it to do much more than we alone could provide. We believe that everybody should be free to tinker with their 3D printers.       The quality of the printed objects is much higher than anybody could achieve on a standard FDM machine. Take a look at the details that PLUTO is able to create:   For more high resolution photos visit the gallery on our website:        
 
Compact size
 We designed PLUTO to be far smaller than regular desktop 3D printers. Its size is only 6.1""x6.1""x11.4"" (155x155x290 mm), so you don't need an extra desk to operate it.   Top-Down architectureStereolithography (SLA) printers can be divided into two groups: bottom-up and top-down machines. Most of the printers on the market today use the bottom-up architecture. Unfortunately there is a significant peeling force after every cured layer, making these type of printers slower and less reliable.These forces act not only on the printed objects but on the vat coating as well, limiting its lifetime. By choosing a top-down architecture we eliminated the problems with resin vats failing mid-print while making the overall construction simpler, therefore more reliable. The obvious downside of this approach is that you have to fill the whole tank to a fixed level, regardless of printed object size.We solved this by filling most of the tank with glycerine, and only adding resin onto the top of it. Glycerine is much denser than resin and won't mix with it, while being completely non toxic and inert. As an added bonus it's water-clear so regardless of the chosen resin's opacity you can see the built object through the glycerine while printing. Magnetic build platformAfter the print is completed you should be able to easily exctract your printed object. No tools needed, just pop the magnetic build platform out of the machine and you can immediately add a clean one to start a new print.Handling the printed object together with the build platform makes cleaning and post curing much easier. German precision - provided by IGUS®We wanted to make the Z axis as rigid and compact as possible. By placing it directly into the tank, we made the distance between the build platform and the leadscrew shorter, ensuring precision.  However this design decision came with its own problems. Added lubrication for the components (leadscrew nut, linear bearing) is out of the question, since it could contaminate the resin. Choosing plastic bearing and nut components, as opposed to metal, was an obvious solution - but during development, we ran into a lot of dead ends. Commonly used plastics are not compatible with stereolithography resins, which results in swelling, distortion and eventually complete mechanical failure.Here is when igus® came to the rescue. They are the world leader in engineered plastic bearing materials and could supply us with the highest precision leadscrews, nuts, bearings and linear guides. Utilizing their products, we could construct a precise Z axis with utmost reliability. Modular Tank DesignThe resin tank with the Z axis is designed to be easy to disassemble and clean. You don't need any tools to take it apart into the build platform, the mechanics of the Z axis and the tank itself. If you would like to go even further, taking the Z axis apart you will only need 2 allen keys (included with PLUTO). PLUTO's PC software is 3Deviser. It was written from the ground up by us and it's source code will be published on GitHub. Import your models in .stl format and prepare them for printing on PLUTO. You can freely move, rotate and scale the objects and even do advanced processing on them like hollowing them out or automatically generating the necessary support structures for overhangs.3Deviser automatically detects all the PLUTOs connected to your network and it enables you to manage all of your printers from one computer.     Our focused image has 100 micron sized pixels on the surface of the resin, but we are still able to print objects with much smoother surface finishes. They can be compared to objects printed at 25-50 micron resolution.  How do we do it?The technology is called antialiasing. We can control each pixel individually and accurately, so we are able to project grayscale images instead of using only black&white pixels.The object on the left shows how the ring would look like without smoothing, the one on the right shows how the grayscale pixels work. If a pixel hits the resin with 50% intensity the resin hardens to a half-width and half-height voxel attached to the neighbouring full intensity pixel's hardened voxel. In practice this means that we effectively multiplied the achievable resolution both in XY and in Z without using a higher resolution projector.   Third party resinsThe working principle of PLUTO (top-down printing, no PDMS coated vat) means that it should be compatible with pretty much every material on the market. If you would like to experiment with different blends from different suppliers, then you can fine-tune the printing settings (such as movement, speed and exposure time) directly from 3Deviser, enabling you to cook up your own recipes for the materials of your choice.  People who are... not satisfied with the capabilities of the traditional FDM printers, but don't have the budget to invest in an expensive SLA machine. Beginners who are...looking for their first machine to experience 3D printing.JewelersWe offer castable resin which supports traditional investment casting processes by burning out without any residue in the furnace. Since PLUTO is a DLP based printer, the printing time only depends on the height of the object. So you can easily print multiple items with high precision at the same time.EngineersIt doesn't matter which engineering field you are coming from, stereolithography ensures the highest precision with durable finished parts. It can be an enclosure for a PCB, a designed product housing or a working mechanical component, you can create what you need from a wide range of materials.Hobbyist / Scale modelersYou only need a small part which you cannot buy separately? Just print it on PLUTO! Or would you like to create custom scale models? Our model making grade material is just the perfect choice for you.HackersPLUTO is designed to be Open Source. Experiment with your wildest ideas and share them with the community!

   If you are interested in the main stages of PLUTO's development, please read our blog post on the following link:   We are a small, but experienced team of mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, product designers, programmers, but first of all: makers. 5 years ago, we experienced 3D printing for the first time, when we bought our first FDM machine. We tried to utilize the technology to complete a range of different tasks, but we faced the never-ending issues of reliability and inaccuracy. It was at this point that we needed a better solution: We met the concept of stereolithography. These kind of printers and their operating costs were prohibitively expensive for our budget, so we had to find an another way. After countless hours of browsing and research, we decided to build our first machines based on SLA technology, back in 2013. Since then we gained a lot of experience in this field, and we built numerous prototypes throughout the years. In 2015 we felt confident enough to set our goal to develop a market-ready, reliable, precise, but still affordable machine. The journey of PLUTO has begun. And here we are today, we have learned a lot and we are proud what we have achieved in the past years. PLUTO is ready and is only waiting for mass production.During the campaign we will be as transparent as possible. Feel free to ask anything in the comment section, we will answer them as soon as possible.You can follow our journey on the following channels as well:  Risks and challengesWe know that bringing a project to life has big risks and challenges after the campaign is over.During the development of PLUTO we set the goal that we should only start our Kickstarter campaign when the development is really finished and the product is ready for mass production.To prove it to ourselves, we fully built 10 pre-production units of PLUTO, enabling us to test and evaluate our supply chain and parts procurement / assembly processes. We can proudly say that we didn't need to change any major aspect of PLUTO or it's manufacturing processes.As our engineers and managers have many years of experience in the field of product development and manufacturing, we know that even while we do our best and work hard, a small problem in the supply chain can cause delivery delays. Therefore we included a 'safety zone' into our timeline to ensure the shipping and distribution of all PLUTOs, on time.During the campaign we will be as transparent as possible and we will inform you about everything through the comments and campaign updates.",46.0,3,"1 Campaign

Multipro is the most multifunctional workshop that can fit into your pocket. This small device is able to substitute 3Dprinter, soldering station, plastic welder, resistance wire cutter, jigsaw, small drill, and electric screwdriver. If you prefer to build the device yourself and customize it to your needs then Kit is the world’s first Open Source multifunctional tool in the world.In 3DSimo we design with compactness and user-friendly experience in mind. 3Dsimo company was founded in 2014, and we have sold more than 40 000 units of our previous models to this date. As a nod to 3D printing fans and makers all over the world, we have announced our Open Source product: 3Dsimo Kit 2. Good things last, great things get even better.We use this saying as our motto at 3Dsimo, and that is why we are happy to introduce you to new members of the 3Dsimo product lineup. They are multifunctional, smarter, more beautiful and more affordable than before. Our aim is to change the way you see and think about our tools.  3D drawing tool works using the same technology as FDM 3D printers, so you can create 3D objects without any knowledge of 3D modeling. Just start creating or repairing.

Create - phone covers, models of buildings, cosplay parts, jewelry, statues, action figures, household items, toys and much more.

Repair - 3D printed objects, toys, delaminated cables, electronic devices and much more.
You can start creating using any 3D printing filament currently on the market (ABS, PLA, HiPS, Flexi, Fluorescent, Wood, Metalic, Thermochrome, Conductive, e.t.c.) thanks to easy to set temperature and feeding speed.  Customize your sneakers or formal footwear and stand out on every occasion. Using the Burning tool, you can burn-in designs into wood, leather, plastic, and repair damaged plastic objects (chargers, phone covers, e.t.c.).

Leather burning - customize your leather wallet, belt, shoes or your pet's collar with the Burning tool

Wood burning - customize wood jewelry, cutting board or even desk of your table. And if you are a skilled artist, you can try even more exotic wood.

Repair and finishing touches - Whatever you create with the 3D Drawing tool, you can finalize with the Burning tool. Also, you can easily repair your 3D printed objects, cracked phone cover or any other plastic device. There is no easier way to repair damaged things than by heating up the broken pieces and connecting them back together.
  For the electrical engineer in you. There is no need of purchase of an expensive soldering station any more. Our products can substitute it fully. Our soldering tip can heat up to 490°C within 20 seconds, while your hand will stay the same. Now you can repair broken USB cable, damaged headphones or create your own electronic devices your self.  Resistance wire cutting tool is an awesome tool for model builders, architects, designers and makers. Now you can create building models, RC models (cars, boats, planes), artpieces and much more. Thanks to high temperature of the wire, you can cut polystyrene, plastic boards, plexiglass, balsa wood and cork with ease. Another great feature is the angle platform, which allows you to set desired angle of cutting for precise and clean cut.Use the Foam cutting attachment to create wooden glass frames, quadcopter frame or for example custom dress bow with ease.  Almost everyone knows a tool called jigsaw, which is used to cut wood, fiberglass and other materials. This tool in its standard form if big, heavy and expensive. Because of that, we though to ourselves, that it is time for a change and we created an attachment for 3Dsimo MultiPro with the same function. What are its advantages? It is small, light and powerful for a great price. Thanks to the fine teeth, it makes clean and precise cut.Saw can be used to cut into wood, fiberglass, carbon, plastic or even aluminium.Make yourself a wooden butterfly, glasses or quadcopter frame.  Electric drill is a valued tool in any household or toolbox of a handy maker.Thanks to microclamps of the Drill attachment, you can use drill bits (0,3 - 3,2mm diameter), engraving bits or grinding bits.

Engraving - engrave glass or metal, create custom designs into glass as a present, or a custom ring

Drilling - drill into wood, plastic, carbon fibre, fiberglass, aluminium, brass or copper

Grinding - choose correct grinding wheel to grind any material, the Drilling attachment can reach upto 20 000 RPM

<strong>lo</strong><strong>•</strong><strong>ca</strong><strong>•</strong><strong>lei</strong><strong>•</strong><strong>kki [loh-kuh-lay-kee]</strong> verb<em>.</em> Play local.</h2>
<p>Have you ever been traveling and just wanted to find a good place to run, walk or ride?  Or maybe you had a workout to do and would enjoy jumping into a local group’s training session if only you could find one? </p>
<p>We have, and did the usual—Google searches, pieced together routes from other sources, jogged aimlessly around a neighborhood only to turn a corner near the end of the run and see a great trail that was RIGHT THERE—if only we (or the hotel concierge!) had known!</p>
<p>That’s why we created localeikki.  We want to help people be active no matter where they are.  localeikki is a national database of recreation locations that are publicly accessible and locally recommended.  Input an address and your activity choice and localeikki will find local running/cycling locations others have shared.  Not only will you know where to go, you'll see pictures of what it looks like and what features are present (e.g., bathrooms, drinking water, parking, surface, hills, baby jogger friendly).  Want to find a regularly scheduled ride or run?  We have that information too!  You'll be able to find us on the web and as an app for your mobile devices.</p>
<p>Our initial focus is on outdoor endurance activities: run, walk, hike, mountain bike, and road cycling.   The geographic goal is U.S. recreation locations--urban, suburban and rural (<em>ok, we'll be honest, the ultimate goal is worldwide recreation!</em>)--so you are never lacking for a locally recommended place to be active.  </p>
<h3><strong><em>Where does the name come from?</em></strong></h3>
<p>The name is a riff off of the concept locavore: loca for local and leikki means play in Finnish—play local. Our goal is that the business not only helps people be active, but also encourages information sharing of great places to be active.  Did someone tell you about a good place to be active?  <em>Pay it forward</em> by sharing the great public places to run, bike, and play in your hometown. </p>
<h3><em>Who are we?</em></h3>
<p>Tracy McMillan and Taylor Thomas are the co-founders of localeikki. Darryl Brown is programmer extraordinaire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracy is a former professor of urban planning and public health (a Longhorn and a Jayhawk in that previous life).  She was tired of just studying active communities and wanted to do more to <em>create and promote</em> them.  She's also worked in the running industry for many years with her husband Greg (McMillan Running Company) and knows the camraderie that exists in running at all levels.  We support one another when we're running, and we can support one another to <em>keep running</em> using a tool like localeikki.  localeikki embodies her passion for exploring new places to play, which she hopes to pass on to her 5 year old son.</li>
<li>Taylor is a veteran of the cycling industry, doing everything from sales to professional racing. He would love nothing more than to see every person being active.  He's been involved in bicycle advocacy for many years and believes every community is full of great places to play.  His involvement with localeikki gives him an outlet to show people that recreation opportunities exist all around them.  When he's not preaching the localeikki gospel, he uses localeikki to find, and share, great experiences with his wife and two dogs.</li>
<li>Darryl owns and operates 2b design and development, a web and mobile applications company in downtown Flagstaff.  Before focusing on web and mobile applications, his career spanned many domains including high frequency financial trading systems, mobile/wireless phone network applications, seismic data analysis and super computing. He loves all things outdoors, including rogue bocce ball games around his patio.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Why crowdfunding? </h2>
<p>Like many start-ups, we began this project empowered by the problem we believe existed and the pennies in our bank accounts.  While that has taken us to the beta phase, we need your help to make localeikki a useful tool nationwide.</p>
<p>Our fundraising goal is <strong><em>$10,000</em></strong>.  Funds will be used to support the build out of the recreation database across the country and to finalize development of the website and iPhone app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 40% of the funds will go towards the programming required to get the app ready for the iTunes App store (estimated launch date = end of summer 2013) and get the website looking 21st century.</li>
<li>60% of the funds will be used for our localeikki ambassador program, where active locals across the county will add content, promote the product, provide feedback and monitor local content as the database grows. While this is a volunteer assignment, ambassadors will be eligible for schwag, cash incentives and prizes for helping us quickly get the database to a stage where it is ready for market.  They also receive the app in beta.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we <em>don</em>'t meet our goal, this percentage breakdown will remain the same; however, we'll have to scale back the ambassador program and delay our public launch.</p>
<p>Our dream scenario, though, is to meet our <em>stretch goal</em> of <em><strong>$15,000</strong></em>, so we can expand our ambassador program and get the Android app completed by the end of the summer as well. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>You've all seen the statistics.  We are a nation (heck, a world!) that by and large needs to be more active.  Not knowing where to go and what to expect when you get there is a significant barrier to folks being active outside of familiar surroundings.  The great thing is, communities across the country are investing more resources to create active places--bike/ped paths, trails, parks, etc.--so you're really never too far from someplace to run, bike, or walk.  Our goal is to get you there, and to grow a community of active folks that share great places and promotes physical activity for all.</p>

<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Introduction</span></h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.ibb.co/VqRBvY1/sofaside.gif"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p><strong>Paus is a time-locking wireless charging stand that helps you create a healthy relationship with your phone. Paus is controlled locally by the Paus app over Bluetooth. No data goes to the cloud. No internet required. </strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The journey to Paus started two years ago after a long conversation around being both present and productive. We loved that phones gave us access to music, directions, and helped us connect with those far away. But the negatives of these devices cannot be overlooked. We procrastinate by turning to our phones and neglecting important activities. We miss out on moments of our lives because we are being distracted from the present. </span></p>
<p>We began our journey by trying digital wellness apps. We found those worked for some time, but we always found a way around them and they eventually became ineffective. We wanted to make something that we could use to put our phone in timeout and lock it away. Something that would empower you to take back control of your phone usage.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3><strong>- Timer Mode -</strong></h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEVwhi9DVvA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Paus is easy to use. Simply open the app, set a duration, and Paus will open when the timer is complete. The app enables ""Do Not Disturb"" (keeping your phone quiet within the box). Integrated wireless charging will ensure your phone is fully charged and ready to go!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>- Alarm Mode -</strong></h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xJR8WeJiGuM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Paus helps you wake up to a phone-free morning, giving you space to get started on the day. When it’s time for bed, set your wake-up time and Paus will help you wind down for a great night's sleep. You can even configure the alarm to go off and then delay the box opening (e.g. 1 hr after the alarm). This will keep you from using your phone first thing in the morning.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>- Emergency Open -</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.ibb.co/D9FMD5M/desksidegif.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>In certain situations, it's important that people can reach you. Paus respects your phone's ""Do Not Disturb"" settings, allowing calls or texts from specific numbers to reach you in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>- Tap Base for Status -</strong></h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBuPgMN9rco?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>

</div></div>","Introduction
 
Paus is a time-locking wireless charging stand that helps you create a healthy relationship with your phone. Paus is controlled locally by the Paus app over Bluetooth. No data goes to the cloud. No internet required. 
The journey to Paus started two years ago after a long conversation around being both present and productive. We loved that phones gave us access to music, directions, and helped us connect with those far away. But the negatives of these devices cannot be overlooked. We procrastinate by turning to our phones and neglecting important activities. We miss out on moments of our lives because we are being distracted from the present. 
We began our journey by trying digital wellness apps. We found those worked for some time, but we always found a way around them and they eventually became ineffective. We wanted to make something that we could use to put our phone in timeout and lock it away. Something that would empower you to take back control of your phone usage.
 
Features
- Timer Mode -

 
Paus is easy to use. Simply open the app, set a duration, and Paus will open when the timer is complete. The app enables ""Do Not Disturb"" (keeping your phone quiet within the box). Integrated wireless charging will ensure your phone is fully charged and ready to go!
 
- Alarm Mode -

 
Paus helps you wake up to a phone-free morning, giving you space to get started on the day. When it’s time for bed, set your wake-up time and Paus will help you wind down for a great night's sleep. You can even configure the alarm to go off and then delay the box opening (e.g. 1 hr after the alarm). This will keep you from using your phone first thing in the morning.
 
- Emergency Open -
 
In certain situations, it's important that people can reach you. Paus respects your phone's ""Do Not Disturb"" settings, allowing calls or texts from specific numbers to reach you in the event of an emergency.
 
- Tap Base for Status -

 
Tap anywhere on the capacitive-touch base for a status update on the time remaining. This allows you to check the status of your device without being interrupted or distracted by a display.
 
- Integrated QI-Certified Wireless Charging - Powered through modern USB-C technology, Paus is compatible with wireless and non-wireless charging phones. The QI-certified  induction charging pad is discreetly hidden behind maple accents.
 
- Universal Fit - Compatible with All Smartphones -
 

 
Paus fits nearly every modern smartphone, from the humble iPhone 4 to the massive iPhone 12 Max.
 
- Sustainably Minded -
Every part of Paus was designed to prioritize quality and minimize environmental impact. We started with aluminum, which is infinitely recyclable and achieves aero-space grade durability. Sustainably sourced maple provides warm accents and a sturdy stainless steel base is built for a lifetime of use. Plastic would’ve been cheaper, but we wanted to make sure that your first Paus would be the only one you’d ever need.
 

 
The Paus App
The Paus app will be available in the iOS App Store and Android Google Play store prior to shipping. The App is free and only requires a Bluetooth connection. The app stores all information locally. No accounts to create or user information stored on the cloud.

The stats page shows your weekly, monthly, and yearly stats in both pie charts and bar graph formats. Here you can track changes in phone-free time vs usage time.

Wrapping your phone in a band can be a great way to remind yourself that now is not the time to be looking at your phone.
At a $6 contribution level, you will get a custom-made rubber band with the text ""BE PRESENT"" on one side (and a secret bonus mantra on the other). This stretchy band is compatible with any sized phone and is a minimalist way to disrupt your habit cycle.

<h3>What is Previewscan</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Previewscan simplify the way we get informed about products, because what has to be done is just to scan the product barcode. How we do it now is to go from one website to another in searching for best prices and reviews from people who have already used our desired product, but this is really time consuming, isn't it?

<p> </p>
<ul><li>Every barcode is unique registred all over the world and it can be used to identify any product. Using it we can create a profile page for every product in the world and put all the information together so that when someone wants to find out more about a product can get it instant.

Just imagine having all the information from all websites into a single handy mobile application, how easier it would be to get informed about any product in the world.
 
Currently the way Previewscan is working, is to receive a barcode as an input and uses results data from one of the search engines (Google, Bing or any other search engine) to find all the information about products.

This process takes a very long time giving the fact that for every barcode the algorithm has to send a query to a search engine. 
A second problem is that all search engines block anyone who sends to many queries in a short period of time.

 
What has to be done is to create a crawler that browses the internet and visit all the websites, so that can store data about products into its own database in order to make the whole process much faster and more accurate. Also browsing the internet bring up more information that can be analyzed and compared so that users have access to data such as lowest prices and product specifications.
 

 
 
For you to be able to see how the algorithm works I created a webpage https://previewscan.com, there you'll find two available tabs that simulate steps followed by the algorithm.
 
Barcode search
 

- Here you can provide a barcode and you get the product name, image and its reviews if the product has some.
 

 
 
Currently the algorithm uses Google for retrieving data and sometimes this feature does not work properly, because after sending a couple of queries Google blocks the server IP for two hours.To avoid this issue I developed an Android application so that you are able to scan your own products.

- Using this tab you have to provide a product url that has reviews and the algorithm print out them. So if you want to test it you can go on amazon or any other website, find a product that has reviews and paste the link here.

- The algorithm saves structure data about product webpages so that for future visits it knows where to look at. This button is used for removing all these data from the database.

<p>Hi Everyone!  Thanks for taking a look at our campaign. The idea for this project came to me one day I had to use my DSLR on a camera crane, with the depth of field that this type of cameras offers, we could not get a perfect focus!. I needed a HF follow focus but I could not find a system with a good value for money. <strong>I could not understand why I had to pay more for an accessory than for the DSLR itself</strong>. That is how the project started!</p>
<p>Create a HF follow focus cheaper than a DSLR, but with the technical features of a professional system.</p>
<p><img alt=""Juste Focus Presentation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vm-cinema.com/indiegogo/JF-TRM1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Juste Focus By VM""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At Visuel Mouvement, we struggle to find innovative solutions in order to improve the equipment for cinema shooting, it is why we imagined and then created the Juste Focus. This remote control follow focus HF is compatible with all types of interchangeable camera’s lenses, it is provided in the form of a kit consisting of a remote, a receiver and a motor. The Juste Focus does a favor to the technician (first camera assistant) affecting the camera lens or DSLR to perform its remote-control focus, the technician avoids manipulating directly the lens which prevents shocks that will disrupt the focus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img alt=""Separation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vm-cinema.com/indiegogo/seplakaat.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What more will the Juste Focus? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A minimalist design which makes easier its handling because there are not useless options which waste time because no failures or errors</li>
<li>Its compatibility. It is compatible with all types of lenses</li>
<li>A high autonomy of the remote (more than 40 hours)</li>
<li>The remote-control of the motor (range: 300 meters outdoor; 40m indoor) avoids shocks on the lens</li>
<li>It is less expensive than a mechanical follow focus and enjoys the selling price the cheapest on the market</li>
<li>Power supply and frequencies HF are internationally compatible</li>
<li>It is lightweight and easy to use</li>
</ul><p><img alt=""Type of Camera"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vm-cinema.com/indiegogo/camera.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Type of camera""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Remote</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The remote pairs up to the receiver which remote control the motor with its Bluetooth connection.The synchronization between the remote and the receiver must be done automatically.The pairing should be done a single time or in case of pairing reset (specified the method).There will be an infinite number of transmitter torques on the same place.The system will work by learning process each time the system is reset by the user.To avoid any interference during the manipulation of the remote, the signal is scrambled.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Receiver</h2>
<p>In order to control the motor with the remote you have to pose the remote on the Pose Pairing to pair it. The receiver mediates between the motor and the camera lens and between the remote and the motor. It consists of two cables: one connecting the receiver to the battery of the device used (DSLR for example), the other connected to the motor.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Motor</h2>
<p>The main function of the motor is to put in motion the camera lens.</p>
<p>It is with this feature of the Juste Focus than the focus takes place with the use of the remote control. The motor consists of one interchangeable gear with several modules (0,8 – 0,6 – 0,5 – 0,4). Moreover it consists of an interchangeable sliding clamp which can position on three different places of the motor in order to varying the grip angles, this sliding clamp allows fixing a camera mount rods with 15mm or 19mm diameter to mounting the motor or the motor can also be mounted with grip (mini magic arm). The motor can perform x rounds to manage to do an entire camera lens round. It is a digital motor, so it has no rounds limits between the two stops.</p>

<h3><strong>Juste Focus Design</strong></h3>
<p> Imagining the Juste Focus we wanted differentiate ourselves from the other market players, it was necessary developing a special design: a design that will be both remarkably simple and efficient. To achieve this we have created a product which gets to the point putting aside items which could disturb its functioning.</p>
<p>We could design a similar product to others and thus at a higher price but at Visuel Mouvement we prefer to find innovative solutions at reduced price. We offer a follow focus of a rare simplicity at an affordable price but which still meets the technical needs of clients: the easy focus.</p>
<p>Before studying design and technology, we began by observing your tastes and preferences. It was verified that 90% of users use only the focus function so we have developed a product of which the ease of use is explained by a single channel to control the focus which will make the focus.</p>
<p>In order to comply our commitment to design a simple product which gets to the point, we put aside the multitude of bulky options on a camera like the Rec and Stop control, otherwise we could not offer you an easy to use product. If we really care that the Juste Focus goes to the basics and we have developed a simple design that is because it is a very good tool that can serve as a spare product on a large camera setup or that will be suitable for other people thanks to its ease of use. Its reliability and sturdiness make that the Juste Focus cannot break down.</p>
<p>For more clarity we have designed a remote that will be suitable for both left and right-handed persons (optimum grip), it is easy to use and cannot make mistakes because it is composed of a minimum of buttons that each has a specific function. If its selling price and its environmental standards respect are important, its design is important too. This is why the Juste Focus has an attractive design and an uncluttered line combining basic and robust components for a use in all simplicity which gets to the point.</p>
<p>Simple and logical ideas to reduce costs and simplify its use to make the product most reliable and make it an essential tool in your next achievements (works).</p>
<p> The Juste Focus only does the focus but it does well !!! </p>

<p>Salut à tous ! Nous vous remercions de jeter un coup d’œil à notre campagne. L’idée de ce projet m’est venue lorsqu’un jour j’ai dû utiliser mon DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) sur une grue lors d’un tournage. Avec la profondeur de champ que ces types d’appareils proposent nous ne pouvions pas obtenir une mise au point parfaite ! J’avais donc besoin d’un HF follow focus mais il était impossible d’en trouver un à un prix abordable. <strong>Je ne comprenais pas pourquoi je devais payer plus pour un accessoire que pour un DSLR</strong>. C’est pour cette raison que le projet Juste Focus est né : créer un HF follow focus regroupant les caractéristiques techniques d’un appareil de haute qualité tout en étant moins cher qu’un DSLR.</p>
<p> Voici comment notre projet a démarré!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Chez Visuel Mouvement, nous nous efforçons de trouver des solutions innovantes pour améliorer le matériel de prise de vue cinéma, c’est pourquoi nous avons imaginé puis créé le Juste Focus. Ce système de mise au point à distance est compatible avec tous types d’objectifs interchangeables, il est proposé sous forme d’un kit composé d’une télécommande,  d’un récepteur et d’un moteur. Le Juste Focus rend service au pointeur en agissant sur l’optique caméra ou DSLR pour effectuer sa mise au point à distance. Grâce à sa fonction de base qui est de contrôler à distance la mise au point de la caméra, l’opérateur évite de manipuler directement l’objectif ce qui entrainerait des secousses qui perturberaient la mise au point.</p>

<h2>Le moteur</h2>
<p>Le moteur a comme fonction principale de mettre l’objectif de l’appareil en mouvement, c’est via cet élément du Juste Focus que la mise au point s’opère avec l’utilisation à distance de la télécommande. Le moteur est composé à une de ses extrémités d’une roue dentée interchangeable grâce à plusieurs modules (0,8 - 0,6 - 0,5 - 0,4).       Il est de plus constitué d’une pince interchangeable coulissante (amovible) qui peut être fixée sur trois endroits différents du moteur pour varier les angles d’accroche, cette pince permet de le fixer sur l’appareil et peut s’ajuster en fonction de l’épaisseur du socle soit en 15mm, 16mm ou 19mm. Pour que le moteur puisse être télécommandé, il dispose d’un connecteur qui se branche au récepteur. Le moteur  peut effectuer x tours pour arriver à faire un tour d’optique de caméra, moteur digital, donc il n’a pas de limites de tours entre les deux butées. </p>

<h3><strong>Juste Focus Design</strong></h3>
<p>En imaginant le Juste Focus nous avons voulu nous différencier des autres acteurs du marché, un design s’est donc imposé à nous : un design qui serait à la fois remarquablement simple et efficace. Pour y parvenir nous avons créé un produit qui va à l’essentiel en mettant de côté des éléments qui ne perturberont pas son utilisation.</p>
<p>Nous aurions pu concevoir un produit similaire aux autres et donc à un prix plus élevé mais chez Visuel Mouvement nous préférons trouver des solutions innovantes à prix réduits. Nous vous proposons un follow focus d’une rare simplicité à un prix plus qu’abordable mais qui répond néanmoins aux attentes techniques des clients : faire le point tout simplement.</p>
<p>Avant d’étudier le design et la technologie, nous avons commencé par étudier vos goûts et vos préférences. Ça a été vérifié, 90% des utilisateurs n’utilisent que la fonction focus donc nous avons développé un produit dont la simplicité d’utilisation s’explique par une seule voie pour contrôler le focus qui fera la mise au point.</p>
<p>Afin de respecter notre volonté de concevoir un produit simple qui va à l’essentiel, nous avons mis de côté la multitude d’options encombrantes présentes sur une caméra comme le contrôle du Rec and Stop par exemple, dans le cas contraire nous n’aurions pu vous proposer un produit simple d’utilisation. Si nous tenons tant à ce que le Juste Focus aille à l’essentiel et que nous avons élaboré un design simple c’est parce que c’est un très bon outil qui peut servir de « spare »  (produit de substitution) sur une grosse configuration caméra ou qui conviendra aux autres grâce à sa simplicité d’utilisation. Sa fiabilité et sa robustesse font que le Juste Focus ne peut pas tomber en panne. </p>
<p>Pour plus de clarté nous avons conçu une télécommande qui conviendra aux droitiers comme aux gauchers (prise en main optimale), elle est simple à utiliser et ne peut pas commettre d’erreurs car elle est composée d’un minimum de boutons qui ont chacun une fonction bien spécifique. Si son prix et son respect des normes environnementales sont importants, son design l’est également. C’est pour cela que le Juste Focus bénéficie d’un design attrayant et d’une ligne épurée regroupant des composants de base et robustes pour une utilisation en toute simplicité qui va à l’essentiel.</p>
<p>Des idées simples et logiques pour réduire les coûts et simplifier son utilisation pour rendre le produit plus fiable et en faire un outil indispensable dans vos prochaines réalisations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Le Juste Focus ne fait que la mise au point mais il la fait bien !!!</p>

Hi Everyone!  Thanks for taking a look at our campaign. The idea for this project came to me one day I had to use my DSLR on a camera crane, with the depth of field that this type of cameras offers, we could not get a perfect focus!. I needed a HF follow focus but I could not find a system with a good value for money. I could not understand why I had to pay more for an accessory than for the DSLR itself. That is how the project started!
Create a HF follow focus cheaper than a DSLR, but with the technical features of a professional system.
 
 
At Visuel Mouvement, we struggle to find innovative solutions in order to improve the equipment for cinema shooting, it is why we imagined and then created the Juste Focus. This remote control follow focus HF is compatible with all types of interchangeable camera’s lenses, it is provided in the form of a kit consisting of a remote, a receiver and a motor. The Juste Focus does a favor to the technician (first camera assistant) affecting the camera lens or DSLR to perform its remote-control focus, the technician avoids manipulating directly the lens which prevents shocks that will disrupt the focus.
 
 
 
What more will the Juste Focus? 

A minimalist design which makes easier its handling because there are not useless options which waste time because no failures or errors
Its compatibility. It is compatible with all types of lenses
A high autonomy of the remote (more than 40 hours)
The remote-control of the motor (range: 300 meters outdoor; 40m indoor) avoids shocks on the lens
It is less expensive than a mechanical follow focus and enjoys the selling price the cheapest on the market
Power supply and frequencies HF are internationally compatible
It is lightweight and easy to use


 
The Juste Focus is available as a kit, the Plug and Play kit. The kit incorporates:

A remote
A receiver
A V1 motor
A clamp: 15mm or 19mm (choice)
A gear: module 0,8 – 0,6 – 0,5 – 0,4 (usually the 0,8 module is the most commonly used)
A transport strap (collar measurement)
A storage briefcase
 

 
The Remote
 
The remote pairs up to the receiver which remote control the motor with its Bluetooth connection.The synchronization between the remote and the receiver must be done automatically.The pairing should be done a single time or in case of pairing reset (specified the method).There will be an infinite number of transmitter torques on the same place.The system will work by learning process each time the system is reset by the user.To avoid any interference during the manipulation of the remote, the signal is scrambled.
 

 
Specs:

Power:                      4 batteries AA (R6)
Autonomy:                40h
Scan Channel:           Auto
Range:                     300m outdoor - 40m indoor
Number of channels:  1
Real-time monitoring of battery status
Storing settings even off
 
Its measurements are:

length :                       152mm
width :                         75mm
thickness :                   75mm
weight (with battery) :    380g
weight (empty) :           280g
 
 
 
The Receiver
In order to control the motor with the remote you have to pose the remote on the Pose Pairing to pair it. The receiver mediates between the motor and the camera lens and between the remote and the motor. It consists of two cables: one connecting the receiver to the battery of the device used (DSLR for example), the other connected to the motor.
 
 

 
Specs:

Power:         12V to 30V Multi Power 
Autonomy:   8h with Vlock 88W/h
Frequency:   2.4 GHz
 
Its measurements are:

Length :           70mm
Width :            84mm
Thickness :      27mm
Weight :          160g
 

 
The Motor
The main function of the motor is to put in motion the camera lens.
It is with this feature of the Juste Focus than the focus takes place with the use of the remote control. The motor consists of one interchangeable gear with several modules (0,8 – 0,6 – 0,5 – 0,4). Moreover it consists of an interchangeable sliding clamp which can position on three different places of the motor in order to varying the grip angles, this sliding clamp allows fixing a camera mount rods with 15mm or 19mm diameter to mounting the motor or the motor can also be mounted with grip (mini magic arm). The motor can perform x rounds to manage to do an entire camera lens round. It is a digital motor, so it has no rounds limits between the two stops.
 
 

 
Specs:

Speed:       68 rpm
Torque:      1 Nm
Module:      0,8 (standard) 
Clamp:       15mm or 19mm 
 
Its measurements are:

Length :      130mm
Thickness :  35mm
Weight :      300g
 

Start-up:
What you need to run the Juste Focus

 

Options:


Juste Focus App for Smartphones IOS and Android:
 
There will be an App to control the JF and we will go further because the App will calculate every depth of field, save the lens measures (between the two stops) until 20 per record and may make as much backups he wants.
 
 

 

 
Communication protocol Open Source
This App is Open Source, thus you are able to redistribute freely the access to the source code and derivative works. You can control your Juste Focus with your own applications in order to integrate it into your systems.
 

 
Juste Focus Design
 Imagining the Juste Focus we wanted differentiate ourselves from the other market players, it was necessary developing a special design: a design that will be both remarkably simple and efficient. To achieve this we have created a product which gets to the point putting aside items which could disturb its functioning.
We could design a similar product to others and thus at a higher price but at Visuel Mouvement we prefer to find innovative solutions at reduced price. We offer a follow focus of a rare simplicity at an affordable price but which still meets the technical needs of clients: the easy focus.
Before studying design and technology, we began by observing your tastes and preferences. It was verified that 90% of users use only the focus function so we have developed a product of which the ease of use is explained by a single channel to control the focus which will make the focus.
In order to comply our commitment to design a simple product which gets to the point, we put aside the multitude of bulky options on a camera like the Rec and Stop control, otherwise we could not offer you an easy to use product. If we really care that the Juste Focus goes to the basics and we have developed a simple design that is because it is a very good tool that can serve as a spare product on a large camera setup or that will be suitable for other people thanks to its ease of use. Its reliability and sturdiness make that the Juste Focus cannot break down.
For more clarity we have designed a remote that will be suitable for both left and right-handed persons (optimum grip), it is easy to use and cannot make mistakes because it is composed of a minimum of buttons that each has a specific function. If its selling price and its environmental standards respect are important, its design is important too. This is why the Juste Focus has an attractive design and an uncluttered line combining basic and robust components for a use in all simplicity which gets to the point.
Simple and logical ideas to reduce costs and simplify its use to make the product most reliable and make it an essential tool in your next achievements (works).
 The Juste Focus only does the focus but it does well !!! 


 Why Indiegogo? 

We've built and tested our prototypes to make sure they are up to our standards. But designing and building a prototype is one thing – Manufacturing and marketing it is another.
We’ve figured out our raw material sources, manufacturing processes, our supply chain and infrastructure. We need your help to go further. We need funds to put the Juste Focus into production.
With your help, we can get past any issues we may run into with advanced laboratory testing, and hiring the best people to help us grow and move forward because we are confident. This product will improve and facilitate the lenses focus and cinema shooting (camerawork).
We are ready to rise this challenge!

Salut à tous ! Nous vous remercions de jeter un coup d’œil à notre campagne. L’idée de ce projet m’est venue lorsqu’un jour j’ai dû utiliser mon DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) sur une grue lors d’un tournage. Avec la profondeur de champ que ces types d’appareils proposent nous ne pouvions pas obtenir une mise au point parfaite ! J’avais donc besoin d’un HF follow focus mais il était impossible d’en trouver un à un prix abordable. Je ne comprenais pas pourquoi je devais payer plus pour un accessoire que pour un DSLR. C’est pour cette raison que le projet Juste Focus est né : créer un HF follow focus regroupant les caractéristiques techniques d’un appareil de haute qualité tout en étant moins cher qu’un DSLR.
 Voici comment notre projet a démarré!
 

 
Chez Visuel Mouvement, nous nous efforçons de trouver des solutions innovantes pour améliorer le matériel de prise de vue cinéma, c’est pourquoi nous avons imaginé puis créé le Juste Focus. Ce système de mise au point à distance est compatible avec tous types d’objectifs interchangeables, il est proposé sous forme d’un kit composé d’une télécommande,  d’un récepteur et d’un moteur. Le Juste Focus rend service au pointeur en agissant sur l’optique caméra ou DSLR pour effectuer sa mise au point à distance. Grâce à sa fonction de base qui est de contrôler à distance la mise au point de la caméra, l’opérateur évite de manipuler directement l’objectif ce qui entrainerait des secousses qui perturberaient la mise au point.
 

 
Qu’est-ce que le Juste Focus a de plus ?

Un design minimaliste qui facilite sa manipulation car pas d’options inutiles, ce qui permet un gain de temps car pas de pannes ni d’erreurs
Sa compatibilité. Il s’adapte à tous types d’objectifs
Une forte autonomie de la télécommande (plus de 40 heures)
Le contrôle du moteur à distance (300 mètres en extérieur et 40 mètres en intérieur) évite qu’il y ait des secousses au niveau de l’objectif
Il est moins cher qu’un follow focus mécanique,  bénéficie du prix de vente le moins cher du marché
Alimentation  et fréquences HF compatibles à l’international
Il est léger et simple à utiliser
 

 
Le Juste Focus est proposé sous forme de kit, le kit Plug and Play. Il comprend :

Une télécommande
Un récepteur
Un moteur V1
Une pince Ø15mm ou Ø19mm (au choix)
Une roue dentée au choix de modules 0,8 – 0,6 – 0,5 – 0,4 (de base le module 0,8 est le plus couramment utilisé)
Une lanière de transport (tour de cou)
Une mallette de rangement
 

 
La télécommande
Elle s’appaire au récepteur qui contrôle le moteur à distance (via bluetooth) 
La synchronisation entre la télécommande et le récepteur se fait automatiquement.
L’appairage se fait qu’une seule fois. Grâce à cela il peut y avoir une infinité de Juste Focus dans la même pièce.
Pour empêcher toute interférence pendant la manipulation de la télécommande, le signal est crypté.
 

 
Caractéristiques techniques:

Alimentation:      4 piles AA (R6)
Autonomie:        40 heures
Fréquence:         2,4 GHz

Poids (avec batteries) :       380g
Poids (nu) :                       280g
 

 
Le récepteur
Afin de contrôler le moteur avec la télécommande, vous devez la poser sur le Pose Pairing pour l'appairer. Il sert d’intermédiaire entre le moteur et la caméra et entre la télécommande et le moteur. Il est constitué de deux câbles, l’un connecte le récepteur à la batterie de l’appareil utilisé l’autre se branche au moteur.

Dimensions:

Longueur:    70mm
Largeur:       84mm
Epaisseur:    27mm
Poids:          160g
 

 
Le moteur
Le moteur a comme fonction principale de mettre l’objectif de l’appareil en mouvement, c’est via cet élément du Juste Focus que la mise au point s’opère avec l’utilisation à distance de la télécommande. Le moteur est composé à une de ses extrémités d’une roue dentée interchangeable grâce à plusieurs modules (0,8 - 0,6 - 0,5 - 0,4).       Il est de plus constitué d’une pince interchangeable coulissante (amovible) qui peut être fixée sur trois endroits différents du moteur pour varier les angles d’accroche, cette pince permet de le fixer sur l’appareil et peut s’ajuster en fonction de l’épaisseur du socle soit en 15mm, 16mm ou 19mm. Pour que le moteur puisse être télécommandé, il dispose d’un connecteur qui se branche au récepteur. Le moteur  peut effectuer x tours pour arriver à faire un tour d’optique de caméra, moteur digital, donc il n’a pas de limites de tours entre les deux butées.

Start-up
Ce dont vous avez besoin pour mettre en marche le Juste Focus:

 
 

 
Options
 

 

 
Application Juste Focus pour Smartphones IOS et Android
Il y aura une application pour contrôler le Juste Focus et on ira plus loin car l’App pourra calculer tout ce qui est profondeur de champ, sauvegarder les mesures d’objectif (entre les deux butées) au nombre de 20 par enregistrement et pourra effectuer autant de sauvegardes qu’il souhaite.
 
 

 
Protocol de communication Open Source
Le protocol de communication est Open Source, vous avez donc la possibilité de redistribuer librement l'accès au code source et aux travaux dérivés. Vous pouvez commander votre Juste Focus avec vos propres applications pour l'intégrer dans vos systèmes.
 

 
Juste Focus Design
En imaginant le Juste Focus nous avons voulu nous différencier des autres acteurs du marché, un design s’est donc imposé à nous : un design qui serait à la fois remarquablement simple et efficace. Pour y parvenir nous avons créé un produit qui va à l’essentiel en mettant de côté des éléments qui ne perturberont pas son utilisation.
Nous aurions pu concevoir un produit similaire aux autres et donc à un prix plus élevé mais chez Visuel Mouvement nous préférons trouver des solutions innovantes à prix réduits. Nous vous proposons un follow focus d’une rare simplicité à un prix plus qu’abordable mais qui répond néanmoins aux attentes techniques des clients : faire le point tout simplement.
Avant d’étudier le design et la technologie, nous avons commencé par étudier vos goûts et vos préférences. Ça a été vérifié, 90% des utilisateurs n’utilisent que la fonction focus donc nous avons développé un produit dont la simplicité d’utilisation s’explique par une seule voie pour contrôler le focus qui fera la mise au point.
Afin de respecter notre volonté de concevoir un produit simple qui va à l’essentiel, nous avons mis de côté la multitude d’options encombrantes présentes sur une caméra comme le contrôle du Rec and Stop par exemple, dans le cas contraire nous n’aurions pu vous proposer un produit simple d’utilisation. Si nous tenons tant à ce que le Juste Focus aille à l’essentiel et que nous avons élaboré un design simple c’est parce que c’est un très bon outil qui peut servir de « spare »  (produit de substitution) sur une grosse configuration caméra ou qui conviendra aux autres grâce à sa simplicité d’utilisation. Sa fiabilité et sa robustesse font que le Juste Focus ne peut pas tomber en panne. 
Pour plus de clarté nous avons conçu une télécommande qui conviendra aux droitiers comme aux gauchers (prise en main optimale), elle est simple à utiliser et ne peut pas commettre d’erreurs car elle est composée d’un minimum de boutons qui ont chacun une fonction bien spécifique. Si son prix et son respect des normes environnementales sont importants, son design l’est également. C’est pour cela que le Juste Focus bénéficie d’un design attrayant et d’une ligne épurée regroupant des composants de base et robustes pour une utilisation en toute simplicité qui va à l’essentiel.
Des idées simples et logiques pour réduire les coûts et simplifier son utilisation pour rendre le produit plus fiable et en faire un outil indispensable dans vos prochaines réalisations.
 
Le Juste Focus ne fait que la mise au point mais il la fait bien !!!


Pourquoi exposer ce projet sur Indiegogo ?
Nous avons créé et testé nos prototypes afin de s’assurer qu’ils répondaient bien à nos critères. Cependant, concevoir et créer un prototype est une chose, le produire puis le commercialiser en est une autre.
Nous nous sommes  débrouillés pour mettre en place nos sources de matières premières, la gestion de nos processus de fabrication, notre chaîne d’approvisionnement et notre infrastructure. Nous avons besoin de votre soutien pour aller plus loin. Il est nécessaire pour nous d’acquérir des fonds pour lancer la production du Juste Focus.
Avec votre soutien, nous pouvons aller au-delà des problèmes susceptibles de nous ralentir grâce à nos tests de pointe en laboratoire et au recrutement de personnel qualifié. Vous avez l’opportunité de nous aider à grandir et à aller de l’avant. Pourquoi ? Car nous en avons la certitude, ce produit améliorera et facilitera la mise au point des objectifs et la prise de vue cinéma.   
Nous sommes prêts à relever ce défi !

You google for hours and ultimately you just have to overpay a professional to fix it for you. Introducing ExpertU, the new video chat app that connects you with OnDemand Experts for instant one-on-one guidance. For a few dollars, get to the root of your problem in just a few minutes!  We have several categories of Experts to accommodate any issue you may need help with, and we’re adding categories all the time! Our Experts are vetted, accredited, and background checked so you know you’re getting reliable advice.  Not only do they know what they’re talking about, they’re fantastic at walking customers through each step! And unlike the auto mechanic who upsells stuff you don’t need, our Experts are located all over the country, so you know you’re getting unbiased support!    What is the Payment Model for the app?The app is free to download and like ridesharing, you only pay when you us it. Once customers are connected with Experts, they start with 10-minutes for a pre-set cost, all between $10-$15 depending on the Expert category. If necessary, the customer can purchase additional time before the session ends.How do I know ExpertU will solve my problem?In our trial runs, our Experts have been able to truly solve most customers’ problems in just one 10-minute session. In the rare instances where it was determined the customer’s next step was indeed to hire a local professional to fix it for them, customers reported that they were still very happy with the experience. They noted that the Expert was able to provide them with a cost expectation, what specifically they’ll need, and that they had a much better general understanding of their task at hand.How do I know I will get a good Expert?Our Experts are thoroughly vetted to ensure they know their stuff. And when customers post their projects and Experts are notified, they get to preview the project so that if for some reason they cannot guaranty to get you the support you need, they cannot take the project on. Additionally, every Expert is rated by their customers after each session – this lets you rest assured that your Expert has successfully helped many others and lets us see an Experts that may be underperforming.Is ExpertU safe?Yes, it is! Unlike services where you must pay a freelancer or professional to come into your home or personal space (ridesharing for example), with ExpertU your Expert is most likely across the country. And in addition to our Experts being vetted and background checked, they are required to give us all of their personal information (name, address, SSN, and bank account info) so it would not behoove them to be inappropriate or vulgar while helping a customer.What are the legal/liability concerns?ExpertU will be using a legally-reviewed set of Terms and Conditions, as well as implement other warning notifications to let customers know that ExpertU and our Experts are not liable for injuries or accidents that occur while a session is being conducted. Even when picturing a worst-case scenario of someone sustaining injury while working on an electrical issue, ExpertU is no more liable than the instructional video that person was watching or the author of the book on electrical projects he was reading.

</p><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Samantha and Ambar met in a business class where we became partners in class projects and papers. We then decided we wanted to fund an idea of our own.  We both agreed there is a sense of frustration associated with finding parking spaces on college campuses.  That's when the idea hit us! We are developing an app that will assist college students in finding a parking space quick and easy. Your contributions will help us make our idea a reality and help develop the details and programming needed to implement the app.  Please explore our indiegogo page more and contribute to our adventure.</p>
<p>
</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contributions will go toward the development of the app itself, as well as the technology necessary for the app to be implemented. We will work with a professional app programer to develop the different aspects of the programming and purchase the motion-activated LED lights as well as the weight-detecting technology.</p>
<p>And ofcourse everyone loves a reward for their generosity so please enjoy these perks we have created especially for you!</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>University App will help you save time, gas, and money. The app will change the way a college student or professor views the parking situation on their campus. University App gives you the ability to locate an empty parking spot on campus, find a security vehicle for safety, and the associated technology will brighten up the campus for you to walk safely to your vehicle. We hope you are inspired by our idea and will contribute to this adventure and watch this app develp into the future.</p>

Our goal is to be a single online service where you can explore and analyse data(sets), create & share your findings and collaborate with your team. No more separate tools for crunching numbers and creating communication materials!

CREATE INTERACTIVE INFOGRAPHICS - LETS BUILD THIS!
Infographics are great marketing and communications tool. Once we're done you can build the traditional infographics like this:


 
As well as truly interactive ones, which your audience can engage with!



 


 

Interactivity enables your audience to see your infographics from personal point of view, making them more relevant and engaging.
Did you know
that your brain registers visual information 60 000 times faster than text. Yes there is debate, if 60 000 is a valid number, but even so fact is that it’s much faster, so your visuals make the first impression.

This is why you should use infographics.

Pen Array is a stylish & minimalistic pen organizer. It is precision machined out of solid Glacier White Corian, crispy white as pure as freshly fallen snow.

An array is a systematic arrangement of similar objects, usually in rows and columns. Compared to traditional pen organizers, Pen Array offers a flexible layout. The pens can be organized in two directions, 45 and 135 degrees, reminding of the handwriting pen position for both right and left handed individuals. 



Stylish & minimalistic on your desk, it also makes a great gift.


It offers an improved pen grip, the fingers fit between the pyramids.
