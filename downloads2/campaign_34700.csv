Along with these adventures, I will also be taking 15 hours of spanish credits that will transfer to my home university (UMKC), all taught by notarized  teachers from the University of Salamanca in Spain. I will be taking a peruvian literature class, a culture for language learners class, a hispanic culture and civilizations and both intermediate and advanced grammar courses. These courses will help me to not only learn about the culture and language from an educational perspective, but from experience as well, as we will take class days to visit some of Peru's most highly sought after historical figures, such as the cathedral, the sacred valley as well as salsa classes and so much more. </p><p>If you are willing to support and help me with my travels, I am more than willing to bring you back a special souvenir from my endeavors abroad, whether that be a handmade alpaca wool trinket, a leather coin purse, or even a post card.

<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.asifa.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ASIFA</a>, The international society of animated film, was founded in 1960 in Annecy, France. With over 30 chapters, ASIFA serves as a global network for animation professionals and enthusiasts. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.asifa-atlanta.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ASIFA-Atlanta</a> started meeting as a group in 1995 and remains the only chapter in the southeastern US.  We believe that animation encourages creative thinkers of all ages to experiment with digital and traditional methods of art and technology.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Do</strong></h3>
<p>ASIFA-Atlanta started by providing screenings of rare and unique animation. Over time we developed relationships with art and film organizations around Atlanta to bring animation panels, demonstrations and free workshops to students, film festivals and conferences.  All in addition to hosting our favorite annual programs:</p>
<p><strong>12 n’ 12 Challenge: </strong>This contest challenges teams of four to create promos for mystery client unveiled in the first hour. Now in its third year, this client-driven animation competition takes place in 24 hours over two days. The client works through concepts and storyboards with each team before selecting a winner.  (Ages 14+)</p>
<p><strong>Animation Draw Workshops: </strong>We design collaborative exercises that encourage participants to learn a variety of techniques within the same space. Whether using a simple light box for hand-drawn animation or multi-plane animation stands, we demonstrate how simple techniques can be done at home.  After the workshop, ASIFA- Atlanta compiles the sequences into one animated film. (Ages 6+)</p>
<p><strong>Regional &amp; International Screenings: </strong>As part of a global network of professional animators and enthusiasts, ASIFA-Atlanta curates unique screenings through the ASIFA’s International Animation Day (IAD) exchange program. Established in 2002, IAD celebrates the first exhibition of animated film in Paris on October 28th, 1892.  Each October, ASIFA chapters exchange their best locally produced animated short films with participating chapters effectively sharing new international animation with audiences all over world. ASIFA-Atlanta selects talent from its annual independent animation festival, “Roll Yer Own”, now in its 11th year.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Tour? </strong></h3>
<p>Since we built our workshops in 2011, we have received numerous requests to expand to after-school programs, museums, libraries and technical schools.  ASIFA-Atlanta wants to meet this demand by taking our most successful programs on tour: 12 n’ 12, Animation Draw Workshops, along with regional and international screenings.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Do We Need Your Help?</strong></h3>
<p>For ASIFA-Atlanta, this Tour means expansion. We want to learn more about what emerging animators and educators require to flourish. At least to start, we’d like to build on what we know.  That means taking established programs to new audiences and recording the process and results. To do so, we are asking for your help to launch phase one, setting up shop and fortifying resources.</p>
<p>To make our first phase of tour stops sucessful, we are fundraising to acquire:</p>
<p>1) A small office space equipped with an editing station and a traditional animation desk.</p>
<p>2) A website to support participants and instructors.</p>
<p>3) Stipends for animation instructors. </p>
<p>4) Supplementary animation software and supplies.</p>
<p>Your contribution will directly contribute towards these goals!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How Else Can You Help?</strong></h3>
<p>Large or small, every contribution helps!</p>

2011, High Museum's Teen Team, experiemental animation workshop. [video]
 
2011, Georgia State University's Tournées Festival of Contemporary French Film. [video]
 
Why Tour? 
Since we built our workshops in 2011, we have received numerous requests to expand to after-school programs, museums, libraries and technical schools.  ASIFA-Atlanta wants to meet this demand by taking our most successful programs on tour: 12 n’ 12, Animation Draw Workshops, along with regional and international screenings.
Why Do We Need Your Help?
For ASIFA-Atlanta, this Tour means expansion. We want to learn more about what emerging animators and educators require to flourish. At least to start, we’d like to build on what we know.  That means taking established programs to new audiences and recording the process and results. To do so, we are asking for your help to launch phase one, setting up shop and fortifying resources.
To make our first phase of tour stops sucessful, we are fundraising to acquire:
1) A small office space equipped with an editing station and a traditional animation desk.
2) A website to support participants and instructors.
3) Stipends for animation instructors. 
4) Supplementary animation software and supplies.
Your contribution will directly contribute towards these goals!
 
How Else Can You Help?
Large or small, every contribution helps!

As part of this campaign ASIFA-Atlanta is hosting a fundraising dinner and after-pary on May 22nd! Learn more by visiting our event website: http://asifa-atlanta.tumblr.com/

We're always recruiting volunteer instructors, designers and technicians to assit with our workshops and share knowlege with participants. If you're interested in volunteering, please email volunteers@asifaatlanta.org

 In-kind contributions for supplies and equipment are greatly appreciated. If you are able to lend a hand, contact Fatimah Abdullah at fatimah@asifa.net",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello world! Thank you for taking the time to consider donating to this unique and empowering opportunity for West African youth!  I am an education Peace Corps volunteer working with the Young Educator's Foundation in Ghana to host the 2014 S.T.A.R.S. Conference.  S.T.A.R.S. (students taking action reaching for success) is a youth empowerment and leadership conference which hosts nearly 70 bright, yet underserved high school students from all of the 10 regions of Ghana.  Secondary schools in Ghana often lack accessibility to mentors and role models for the students and offer very little, most of the time nothing, in the way of career coaching and leadership skill development.  For S.T.A.R.S. participants, this is often the only opportunity they have to have one on one conversations with professional career mentors, learn the importance of making healthy life choices, discover scholarship opportunities, and participate in activities which will assist them in realizing and acheiving thier potential and life goals.  By contributing to this campaign and making S.T.A.R.S. 2014 a reality, you are directly impacting the success of the future leaders of Ghana which will lead to a stronger nation!</p><p> Data collected from attendees of previous years' S.T.A.R.S. events show that after the conference, attendees return to their towns and schools with a new-found sense of ambition and responsibility and organize activities which also empower their peers to realize the opportunities around them and take control of their future.  Therefore, the beneficiaries of this event stretch far beyond the participants alone.You see, here in Ghana, outlooks for careers for individuals who are unable to pay the high cost of university education are often limited to a very small selection of low paying jobs.  Most families cannot afford to send their children to secondary school and college often is not even an option due to the high price.  This makes higher education opportunities unattainable for the majority of the population living in the lower socioeconomic classes. Children come from uneducated parents who unfortunately are often unable to provide coaching and advice as they faced the same vicious cycle of lack of education and poverty themselves.  By donating to this conference, you are providing young people with quite possibly the only opportunity overcome their socioeconomic situation and realize an alternative future.</p><p>In order for this conference to take place, we need to reserve the conference venue and 70 student beds for one week as well as provide three full meals for each attendee and the the conference organizers.  In addition, as the students we invite to attend come from impoverished situations, we reimburse each participant for travel.  The rest of the funding is used for materials and supplies, PA system rentals, and compensation and accommodation for guests speakers, mentors, and key note speakers at the event.</p>

<h2>Our goals:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Complete an unfinished building: Pour the cement floor, install windows and doors, and plaster/paint the interior. Purchase a locking supply cupboard and 30 desks.</li>

</ul><ul>
<li>Provide textbooks, writing utensils, and paper for all students.</li>

<h3>Ingrid's Story</h3>
<p>I am an artist and sole proprietor, who provides a variety of online multimedia services to fellow artists of multiple disciplines, non-profit organizations and other small businesses. I do graphic/web design, Internet marketing and conduct ongoing Internet research for education, strategy and development. My business is still young (founded in 2005), so I still need the communities support to keep pushing!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As a Teaching Artist in Brooklyn, I teach dance, studio art and writing to children, as well as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and studio art to adults. I've even taught elderly citizens how to use their computers and inspired technology-phobes to love Internet technology. While daydreaming in the summer of 2009, it suddenly dawned on me that I wanted to teach. Ever since then, teaching opportunities have been crossing my path! But, as we all know, teaching is a labor of love. Thus, maintaining my multimedia clientele has become more important than ever.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>However, on Monday, December 27th, my laptop and sole computer for my business died completely. R.I.P. Beep. The logic board failed and the only reasonable answer is to get a new computer. I've been running outdated software, have a ink-hungry printer that's been sitting empty for months, and have never owned a video camera. <br/></p>

Your impact will reach a local, national, and international community of awesome people -- like you!</p>
<p><br/></p>

Hopefully, this campaign will at least make enough to purchase a new computer and get the software I need to run my business.

<p> </p>
<p>Where were you when you fell in love with books? For most of us it was our school's library. Shelves filled with stories, facts, and unlimited knowledge. What if you didn't have access to these books as a child, how would your life be different now?</p>
<p>I arrived in The Republic of Georgia to teach English at the end of May after completing my Masters in Library and Information Science. When I arrived at my village's school I immediately asked about the library. Walking into the small room I was overwhelmed by the smell of musty old books. The library hasn't had any funding since the Soviet era leaving the students with old books in very poor condition. Almost all have water damage and are falling apart. None of the material available is in English. </p>
<p>My goal for this project is to raise enough funds to build an English section at the library and also to provide students with some new Georgian language materials. It's vital that students have a chance to read not only in English but in their native tongue, developing a life long love of reading. Popular fiction and up-to-date non fiction will be purchased in both languages using donated funds.  If able to raise $500 then we will be able to purchase around 50 new books for the Tskaltubo Village School.</p>
<p>Working with local teachers and the school librarian we will select and purchase materials which fit the needs of all the students here. Many children in the village of Tskaltubo don't have the Internet, television, or anyway to connect with the outside world. Donors will be giving these children a chance to see what lies beyond Georgia and become active participants in the world.</p>
<p>While I can't offer you any perks for donating, every person who contributes will get an email from me with photos of the new books set up in the library. Every penny helps to ensure a child here in Georgia has a book to read! </p>

<p><strong>Here is my story and why I am so motived and inspired to do this challenge:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hong Nhung - </strong>is a young woman in Vietnam and for the past five years I have happily paid for her high school education.</p>

But with all worth while projects it takes money. And The Evel Knievel museum is no different. </strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>But first things first. Thats where the Evel Knievel Stunt and Crash Car Project comes into play. The Stunt and Crash car is believed to have been built by legendary custom car maker George Barris. It was used at many of Evels biggest jumps as a way to promote the toy version of the car made by Ideal. The Evel Knievel Ideal toy line was one of the most popular toys in history. The stunt and crash car was also featured in the 1977 movie cult classic Viva Knievel Starring the one and only Evel Knievel.  The real life car was thought lost for many years. But a couple of years before Evel passed away the car was found in Las Vegas. Evel was planning on having it restored with hopes that it would one day be on display in the museum he had hoped to open. But as his health issues took on the larger role in Evels life all plans for the car were put on the back burner. <br/></strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Recently a deal was made with the Knievel estate and the car was bought and is now waiting restoration in Florida. Thats where we are hoping for you help with the project. We are hoping to raise money for the restoration of the car so it will be ready for display at next years Evel Knievel Days. Evel Knievel Days is a yearly event that takes place the last week of July in Evel's home town of Butte Montana.  </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ABC's Wide World of Sports was the place to be back in the glory days of Evel Knievel. Evel was one of the few people you could count on to keep his word and give you your money's worth. He was the greatest showman on earth.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Please take this time to think back to the Evel era, the greatest era in history, the 1970's. Think about the times you waited in front of your TV set for Evel Knievel to make another one of his spectacular motorcycle jumps.<br/></strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Think back on that Christmas morning when all you wanted was the coolest toy ever made. The Evel Knievel stuntcycle and action figure. And you got it, memories like that are once in a lifetime and priceless. Memories brought to you by Evel Knievel.</strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>So with all that being said Evel Knievel was willing to give his very life to thrill the crowd and in doing so became a legend. And now you have a chance to give back to the man that was willing to give everything. Help me make Evel's dream come true.  And all money raised will go towards restoring the car. The car will be used to promote the museum and anything else we can do to keep Evel's legend alive. Evel may be gone, but his great American spirt and the legend he created over 40 years ago MUST LIVE ON. Please help. Thanks for your time.</strong></p>

<h3> Once the car is restored it will be displayed at car shows and other events. Used to promote Evel Knievel's history and the legend he recreated over 45 years ago. With the hopes of one day opening the museum Evel had dreamed of all those years.<br/>We need to raise $15,000 for the complete restoration of the car. All money raise will be used for that purpose.

<p dir=""ltr"">Fresh water is emerging as the most critical resource issue facing humanity.  The U.S. has risen to the top of chart for water usage totaling 410 billion gallons per day.  In California 19% of statewide energy is expended for the purpose of transporting and cleaning water.  Of the clean water that flows into Californian homes, over 50% is used outdoors.  This is simply unsustainable.   </p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Challenge #2</strong></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the 20th century, education put youth in rows of desks and asked them to learn through canned lectures. We can no longer afford to train workers for the 20th century job market. The 21st century job market demands the ability to apply new technology across multiple disciplines, communicate via new media, and apply  classroom lessons in the field.  We need a 21st Century Workforce.  </span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Response</strong></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We have developed the Environmental Media Workshop to address both of these challenges.  Students hone 21st Century Workforce skills by tackling real world problems. They have discovered that  WATER is the issue of their generation, and that  rainwater harvesting is a simple, effective solutions to address this problem.  Their work  is aimed at building awareness about Rainwater Harvesting Systems. In the process of creating a Rainwater Harvesting Campaign, these students will learn the basic techniques media campaign development . </span><span> </span></p>
<p>At the core of this campaign will be a short film that promotes residential rainwater harvesting systems as a means to tackle this global issue by acting at the local level. We have already garnered strong local support for our efforts. Our partners include the Contra Costa County Workforce Development Board, the City of Martinez, the Watershed Project, the Contra Costa County Water Conservation &amp; Flood Control District, The Friends of Alhambra Creek and Kiwanis International – Martinez.</p>

Fresh water is emerging as the most critical resource issue facing humanity.  The U.S. has risen to the top of chart for water usage totaling 410 billion gallons per day.  In California 19% of statewide energy is expended for the purpose of transporting and cleaning water.  Of the clean water that flows into Californian homes, over 50% is used outdoors.  This is simply unsustainable.   
 
Challenge #2
In the 20th century, education put youth in rows of desks and asked them to learn through canned lectures. We can no longer afford to train workers for the 20th century job market. The 21st century job market demands the ability to apply new technology across multiple disciplines, communicate via new media, and apply  classroom lessons in the field.  We need a 21st Century Workforce.  
 
Response
We have developed the Environmental Media Workshop to address both of these challenges.  Students hone 21st Century Workforce skills by tackling real world problems. They have discovered that  WATER is the issue of their generation, and that  rainwater harvesting is a simple, effective solutions to address this problem.  Their work  is aimed at building awareness about Rainwater Harvesting Systems. In the process of creating a Rainwater Harvesting Campaign, these students will learn the basic techniques media campaign development .  
At the core of this campaign will be a short film that promotes residential rainwater harvesting systems as a means to tackle this global issue by acting at the local level. We have already garnered strong local support for our efforts. Our partners include the Contra Costa County Workforce Development Board, the City of Martinez, the Watershed Project, the Contra Costa County Water Conservation & Flood Control District, The Friends of Alhambra Creek and Kiwanis International – Martinez.
 
Who Are We
LUNCHBOX INTERNATIONAL is a digital development company creating culturally relevant films and content for the global market. With our background in music video, branded entertainment and feature films we are pop culture aficionados who pride ourselves on creating and executing superior product. We believe that everyone has a story to tell.
The mission of Lunchbox Edutainment is to maximize community impact by partnering with educators and non-profit organizations to bring the power of storytelling to college and high school students. Our goal is to give voice to the voiceless - then project it on the world stage.
The driving force behind Lunchbox International is Professor Steven A. Cleveland from the Department of Ethnic Studies at CSUEB who brings years of experience as an executive, creative producer, project manager and youth educator to every workshop.  
We have joined forces with the New Leaf: A Sustainable Living Collaborative on a rainwater harvesting project. New Leaf is a high school program which employes out of the box, project-based learning to helps students reach their full potential. Dr. Rona Zollinger, Co-Founder of New Leaf and 2012-2013 County Teacher of the Year, encourages her students to unearth issues of sustainability and create authentic relationships with their local environment and community. In our workshop, the students grow within a collaborative atmosphere. Our  team is helping to transform education and the local environment by moving their community towards a sustainable future.  
What Is Needed
We need to raise the funds to provide 20 students with hands-on, project-based service-learning, that looks to communicate the importance of conserving water while preparing students for the 21st century job market.
The funding will go directly to:


Student professional training in 



Marketing


Green Design and Rainwater Harvesting Systems 


Project Management



Life Skills Workshops


Producing Rainwater Harvesting 



Film


Website 


Promotional Flyers


Over the summer, the students will develop a campaign targeting homeowners, with the goal of installing over 5,000 gallons of rainwater harvesting capacity in Martinez, CA. The students will be trained as project managers, which will require that they learn both green and new media job skills. Students will learn directly from rainwater harvesting and green building professionals who will train them in the fundamentals of sustainable design.

In the spring of 2014, RCC launched the Armstrong High School Cycling Team, a youth mountain bike racing team and after school program. The team is available at no cost to its participants and focuses heavily on accountability, hard work, and strong guidance.<br/><br/>-We are blasting off of the incredibly successful first year of the Armstrong Team (Armstrong is among the most under-served high schools in Virginia, yet ranked 3rd out of 14 other schools competing in the NICA inter-school race series). We are expanding the program into one middle school and two elementary schools within the same district. We will be working with close to 100 young people for the 2015 year, providing strong programs and role models, as well as once in a lifetime trips to races and mountain bike destinations throughout the region. <br/><br/>-We need your help to hire more staff! In order to effectively quadruple our programming and bring this good thing to as many youth as possible, we need to hire a third coach! We have the IDEAL candidate: Matt Kuhn<br/><br/><b>Who is this Matt Kuhn fellow?<br/></b>-Matt has been with us since Jump...er...Phaup Street! (Phaup St. is one of the main arteries through Fairfield Court, the public housing project we are predominantly focused within). He has been a stalwart volunteer since 2011, and already has a very strong bond with all of our youth. He's not too shabby on the bike either as you will see in the video above!<br/><br/>-Matt is also an Eagle scout and Wilderness First Responder. He has a degree in Sociology from Virginia Commonwealth University and has been riding bicycles in a serious way for over a decade.<br/><br/><b>REAL TALK:<br/></b>-Let me be frank for a moment. The shiny material trappings of an organization's programming are fun and easy to fund. They are tangible, satisfying to look at, easy to put one's finger on. Within RCC, we certainly have nothing less that humble gratitude for every bike in our stable.<br/><br/>But this is a special case. If not placed in the capable hands of a dedicated and special person, the bicycle is merely a shiny toy. The magic occurs when the right tool is put in the hands of the right person. Matt Kuhn is absolutely that person. Allowing him to join our organization as full time staff will effectively provide a whole slew of youth with a role model dedicated to their wellfare and development. We are asking for your help funding this important person's salary for the 2015 calender year. <br/><br/>If you think about it, what could possibly be better than to give a young person a strong mentor? Your contribution will fund Matt's salary for one whole year of full-time outreach work! So please, help us get Matt Kuhn for Valentine's Day this year! <br/><br/><b>Impact?<br/></b>-Massive as far as we are concerned. Providing us with the funds to make this new hire will allow for huge growth in our programming and the reach of our influence. Most important is the simple fact that such a large number of youth will get a role model who can do a world of good for them. <br/><b><br/>Other ways to help:<br/></b>-Thank you so much for reading this far. If you are unable to give at this time, simply sharing this with others will be a huge help and a contribution in and of itself. <br/>-Like us on Facebook! (See link below).

</div></div>","So what is this all about?-Richmond Cycling Corps does revolutionary, innovative, and extremely effective outreach toward youth living in public housing here in Richmond, VA. In the spring of 2014, RCC launched the Armstrong High School Cycling Team, a youth mountain bike racing team and after school program. The team is available at no cost to its participants and focuses heavily on accountability, hard work, and strong guidance.-We are blasting off of the incredibly successful first year of the Armstrong Team (Armstrong is among the most under-served high schools in Virginia, yet ranked 3rd out of 14 other schools competing in the NICA inter-school race series). We are expanding the program into one middle school and two elementary schools within the same district. We will be working with close to 100 young people for the 2015 year, providing strong programs and role models, as well as once in a lifetime trips to races and mountain bike destinations throughout the region. -We need your help to hire more staff! In order to effectively quadruple our programming and bring this good thing to as many youth as possible, we need to hire a third coach! We have the IDEAL candidate: Matt KuhnWho is this Matt Kuhn fellow?-Matt has been with us since Jump...er...Phaup Street! (Phaup St. is one of the main arteries through Fairfield Court, the public housing project we are predominantly focused within). He has been a stalwart volunteer since 2011, and already has a very strong bond with all of our youth. He's not too shabby on the bike either as you will see in the video above!-Matt is also an Eagle scout and Wilderness First Responder. He has a degree in Sociology from Virginia Commonwealth University and has been riding bicycles in a serious way for over a decade.REAL TALK:-Let me be frank for a moment. The shiny material trappings of an organization's programming are fun and easy to fund. They are tangible, satisfying to look at, easy to put one's finger on. Within RCC, we certainly have nothing less that humble gratitude for every bike in our stable.But this is a special case. If not placed in the capable hands of a dedicated and special person, the bicycle is merely a shiny toy. The magic occurs when the right tool is put in the hands of the right person. Matt Kuhn is absolutely that person. Allowing him to join our organization as full time staff will effectively provide a whole slew of youth with a role model dedicated to their wellfare and development. We are asking for your help funding this important person's salary for the 2015 calender year. If you think about it, what could possibly be better than to give a young person a strong mentor? Your contribution will fund Matt's salary for one whole year of full-time outreach work! So please, help us get Matt Kuhn for Valentine's Day this year! Impact?-Massive as far as we are concerned. Providing us with the funds to make this new hire will allow for huge growth in our programming and the reach of our influence. Most important is the simple fact that such a large number of youth will get a role model who can do a world of good for them. Other ways to help:-Thank you so much for reading this far. If you are unable to give at this time, simply sharing this with others will be a huge help and a contribution in and of itself. -Like us on Facebook! (See link below). We post regularly with program pictures and updates and would love to have you along for the ride.Your donation is available as a tax deduction under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Federal ID #: 58-2508155

<li>My name is Anna Westbrook and I have ten years of experience in educational children's programming. I have been traveling to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for seven years to live, work, and study Dominican-Haitian Relations. I am a music major and a dance minor and I teach piano lessons at several locations near my hometown of New London, CT, including at a primarily Haitian community.</li>
<li>I will be teaching music and dance lessons in an orphanage in Haiti run by Love in Motion, a Monadnock Bible Conference Ministry. See their website here: <a href=""http://www.monadnockbible.org/haiti/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.monadnockbible.org/haiti/</a>
</li>
<li>I believe teaching music is my way of making a lasting difference on the lives of the children in this orphanage. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By contributing, you will be supporting the personal growth of the students in the orphanage. Music helps people, and learning to make music is one of the most empowering things we can teach someone. Please join with me in empowering these kids. </span>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I need help physically getting there:</p><ul>
<li>I am requesting $1000 for travel costs. The orphanage is providing me room and board in exchange for the amount of time and effort I am putting into preparing for and executing this project. I expect to pay $400-$600 on plane tickets, $80-200 on bus fare, and $120-200 on water and other necessities. Any extra funding will be reserved for emergency travel needs until the end of my trip, at which point it will be donated to the orphanage.</li>
<li>Perks for supporting me range from thank you notes to coffee dates, and every person who donates will be given a copy of my financial records after the trip. </li>
<li>If I don't reach my entire goal, I will put the money I receive towards a plane ticket and find another way to supplement my funding. Regardless of whether I reach my full goal, I am going on this trip.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Where My Heart Is At</h3><p>I've learned a lot over the seven years I've been volunteering in Haiti. If you want to understand my mind and hear my heart, read some of what I've written:</p><ul>

</ul></div>","Short Summary
My name is Anna Westbrook and I have ten years of experience in educational children's programming. I have been traveling to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for seven years to live, work, and study Dominican-Haitian Relations. I am a music major and a dance minor and I teach piano lessons at several locations near my hometown of New London, CT, including at a primarily Haitian community.
I will be teaching music and dance lessons in an orphanage in Haiti run by Love in Motion, a Monadnock Bible Conference Ministry. See their website here: http://www.monadnockbible.org/haiti/

I believe teaching music is my way of making a lasting difference on the lives of the children in this orphanage. By contributing, you will be supporting the personal growth of the students in the orphanage. Music helps people, and learning to make music is one of the most empowering things we can teach someone. Please join with me in empowering these kids. 

What I Need & What You GetI need help physically getting there:
I am requesting $1000 for travel costs. The orphanage is providing me room and board in exchange for the amount of time and effort I am putting into preparing for and executing this project. I expect to pay $400-$600 on plane tickets, $80-200 on bus fare, and $120-200 on water and other necessities. Any extra funding will be reserved for emergency travel needs until the end of my trip, at which point it will be donated to the orphanage.
Perks for supporting me range from thank you notes to coffee dates, and every person who donates will be given a copy of my financial records after the trip. 
If I don't reach my entire goal, I will put the money I receive towards a plane ticket and find another way to supplement my funding. Regardless of whether I reach my full goal, I am going on this trip.
Where My Heart Is AtI've learned a lot over the seven years I've been volunteering in Haiti. If you want to understand my mind and hear my heart, read some of what I've written:

With the acceptance of three roundtable sessions on contingency, NWSA has shown support for the work that needs to be done to address working conditions in higher education. We need your help to match that support with funding.What We NeedContingent faculty have been, and continue to be, left out of professional development opportunities because of lack of support from the colleges, universities, and associations of which they are faculty and members, including the funds to attend conferences.  Although all of our participants applied for funding from the NWSA and their institutions (where possible), five participants were not able to access enough funding to attend the conference.
Money raised will help five contingent faculty members attend the NWSA. Members have all already been accepted as participants in the conference, and have registered. 
Additional money will be donated first to contingent faculty and other precariously employed individuals who have also been accepted to the conference, but did not receive sufficient funding, either from the NWSA or their employers. 
Any further additional money will be donated to the NWSA for the creation of a fund to support contingent faculty travel expenses for future conferences, directly addressing the increasingly precarious nature of our profession. 
The ImpactBy supporting contingent faculty members, you will enable our roundtable participants to contribute to the first multi-session discussion on the theme of contingent labor at an NWSA conference. The roundtable participants are eager to collaborate with conference attendees - not only to make contingent faculty’s voices heard, but also to outline some concrete steps that NWSA members can take to address these issues in women’s and gender studies departments and programs around the country.  We anticipate that outcomes of these initial efforts (including this fundraising effort!) will help to ensure that conversations about the future of women’s and gender studies include *all* members of this diverse and ever-expanding discipline for years to come.    Details, Details$500 per person ($2500 total) will get our remaining five participants to the conference.

The GMS has since been a place where musically talented children (aged 7-16) are incubated, where they learn the joy of music, and share it with their community. The School has also opened opportunities for children’s talents and skills to grow and be exposed to a variety of cultures through the international language of music.</p>
<p>The school opens opportunities for musically talented children, ages 7-16, to learn the joy of music, and share it with their community.  About 185 students are currently enrolled in the school’s regular program, which offers lessons for seven instruments: oud, violin, piano, guitar, qanun, trumpet, and cello.</p>
<p>The Gaza Music School contributes to filling in the huge gap of music teaching in schools    and among children and youth in Gaza where arts courses in general and music in particular have been constantly negligencted in Palestinian schools  generally. Arts centres in Gaza  are either inexistnet or lack the specialized cadre, let alone discouragement from the schools or families for their children to get enrolled in such creative fields.This project is a challenge to the imposed closures and state of isolation as well as a challenge to social hindrances since it involves equally male and female students.</p>
<p> In Gaza Strip , closures, isolation and fragmentation imposed by Israel, are negatively affecting all forms of Palestinians’ daily life. This project contributes to activating cultural life, enabling the ESNCM to expand its academic and non-academic programs in order to reach a wider range of the society to learn and enjoy music, promoting music and musicians, and enhancing internal and international exchange. Such activities have a great influence to elevate people’s hope, resilience, perseverance and steadfastness amid all daily encounters of despair and frustration.</p>
<p>The A.M. Qattan Foundation Launched the Gaza Music School (GMS) project in July 2008, in response to growing demand for music education in the Gaza Strip.  GMS started as a three-year pilot project with co-funding partnership from the Swedish International Development Agency.  It offers the first-ever structured and long-term music education programme in Gaza.  While the ESNCM gave it’s technical and academic support helping the school management to establish its curricular and academic set up.</p>
<p>In January 2009, GMS was destroyed during the Israeli war on Gaza.  In recognition of the vitality of the GMS to the social, psychological, and artistic development of children – and against tremendous odds – the A.  M.  Qattan Foundation re-opened the School three months later in a new expanded space, and adding to the team to accommodate the growing number of students.  Support of the reopening effort came from individuals and institutions locally and from Sweden, Norway, the UK, Germany, France and the USA. </p>
<p>Following an agreement between the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music and the Qattan Foundation, the GazaMusicSchool was handed to the ESNCM on April 1st 2012, therefore becoming the Conservatory’s fifth branch in Palestine.

The GMS has since been a place where musically talented children (aged 7-16) are incubated, where they learn the joy of music, and share it with their community. The School has also opened opportunities for children’s talents and skills to grow and be exposed to a variety of cultures through the international language of music.
The school opens opportunities for musically talented children, ages 7-16, to learn the joy of music, and share it with their community.  About 185 students are currently enrolled in the school’s regular program, which offers lessons for seven instruments: oud, violin, piano, guitar, qanun, trumpet, and cello.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Sky Candy has been teaching classes and creating innovative aerial theate since 2010.  As we grow and become an increasingly busy and established group, it's key that we foster growth and opportunities in our teacher group, as well as connect with the greater aerial and circus arts community.</p>
<p>In February 2013, the New England Center for Circus Arts will be teaching the introductory and foundational classes for their <a href=""http://necenterforcircusarts.org/learn/professionaldevelo/teachertraining/nacertification/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nimble Arts Teacher Certification Course</a>.  This course is one of the country's first and only aerial arts teaching certification programs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Funding Teacher Training</h3>
<p>Three of our teachers - Bethany, Joanna and Winnie - will be headed up to Vermont from February 17 - 24 for this intensive one week program.  In addition to missing out on a week of teaching classes and hosting open studios (the primary income source for all three of these folks), the trio will largely be funding this trip, including all program expenses on their own.  Here's the breakdown of what we're looking at:</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED: Jan 12, 2013</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NECCA Course Fees: $3375 </li>
<li>Air Travel: $900</li>
<li>Lodging &amp; Local Transport: $390 (thanks, Julia L!)</li>
<li><strong>TOTAL: $4665</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This campaign is set at a goal of $1500 to help Bethany, Joanna and Winnie defray some of costs of this trip, which will hope will provide a great benefit to our local aerial community and its student body.  We hope that providing more opportunities to train and learn outside of our studio will help bring a higher level of professionalism and expertise to our already amazing teacher's group! </p>
<p>Support this campaign and we've got loads of prizes for you including Sky Candy classes, private lessons, tee-shirts, invite to an exclusive send-off party, and more!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>If you can't donate, it's totally cool!  We will love you loads and hope that you can help us out by sharing this campaign with your friends.</p>

 IN ENGLISH!



 Qui suis-je?






Christian Keime, lorrain de
  souche, marseillais d'adoption. Naguère palefrenier, cavalier, enseignant, éditeur
  et musicien, j'étudie les dialogues de Platon depuis plusieurs années.
  Aujourd'hui, j'expérimente une nouvelle manière de parler de philosophie
  antique en donnant des conférences publiques ouvertes à tous, en construisant
  un site internet et en enregistrant des émissions sur Platon destinées aux
  enfants. En savoir plus?


 Où vais-je?


J’ai été admis en doctorat à Cambridge à partir de janvier
2015. Je veux écrire une thèse qui montre que Le Banquet de Platon donne des
leçons pratiques et modernes de communication et de pédagogie.
En savoir plus sur mon projet de thèse?



Scène de banquet, fresque de Paestum, vers 500 av. J.-C.



Pourquoi Cambridge?
Cambridge est le lieu idéal pour mener à bien une étude interdisciplinaire comme la mienne, à la croisée de la littérature, de la philosophie et des théories de la communication. C'est aussi dans cette université que j'ai rencontré le plus grand nombre de spécialistes du Banquet de Platon.
Au terme de trois ans de thèse, j'effectuerai trois voyages d'études en Allemagne et aux Etats-Unis pour travailler avec d'autres spécialistes de Platon. 

Et pourquoi une thèse?




Pour pousser plus loin ma recherche à l’université : je
chercherai des leçons de communication et de pédagogie dans d’autres dialogues
de Platon et chez d’autres auteurs.



    




        


Pour transmettre à un large public le résultat de ma recherche : aux étudiants ainsi qu’aux non spécialistes curieux de philosophie et d’Antiquité. Un diplôme de Cambridge donnera de l’autorité à une démarche pédagogique atypique que j’engage aujourd’hui dans le cadre de ma campagne.




            Raphaël, L'Ecole d'Athènes, vers 1510.


Soutenez-moi, Platon vous le rendra!



Pour présenter mon projet et remercier les donateurs, je propose
des conférences sur Platon ouvertes à tous, en particulier à ceux qui craignent les conférences de philosophie ancienne ! Voir les prochaines dates ?
Dans le même esprit, le site internet Platosphère présente Platon à différents types de public. Si je peux poursuivre mon
travail, ce site sera demain un lieu d’information et d’échange
privilégié sur Platon : il fournira des informations sur l’actualité de la
recherche, des outils d’analyse pour les étudiants, et tout le monde y apprendra
que Platon est lisible, souvent drôle, et qu’il sait même parler aux enfants du
XXIe siècle.
Envoyez un palefrenier à l’université : vous ferez entrer Platon dans la cité!



Théodore Géricault, Course de chevaux libres, 1817. 



Où ira votre argent?




Coût total de la première année d’étude à
  Cambridge :
inscription (36%), logement (27%) et dépenses courantes
  (37%)
 


25 000 €
 




Déjà financé (travaux
  d’édition) :
 


17 000 €




Reste à
  financer :


8 000 €




Est-ce bien
réaliste ?


Oui! Si je parviens à réunir 8000 € pour la première année, je
pourrai financer plus facilement les années suivantes :





grâce à mon expérience du crowdfunding, j’organiserai une
campagne plus efficace l’année prochaine,



grâce à votre soutien, mon projet sera plus crédible auprès
d’autres mécènes, en particulier les entreprises et les fondations privées,



en étudiant à Cambridge, je trouverai plus facilement
qu’en France des opportunités de travail, en particulier pendant les
vacances : cours privés ou ""summer schools"".




Comment m’aider ?
Vous pouvez m’aider même
sans argent. Parlez du projet autour de vous et communiquez sur les
réseaux sociaux :

en partageant cette page sur Facebook, Twitter et Google+ (voir les onglets de partage en haut de  page),
en partageant Platosphere sur les réseaux sociaux,

Merci, déjà ...


au chœur Filigrane,
à Albert, Almut, Anne, Elsa, Emmanuelle, Guy, Marie Annick, Maximilien, Moritz,
Ragip, Sandy et Véronique pour leur participation enjouée à l’enregistrement du
pitch. Merci à Elizabeth pour sa relecture généreuse du texte. Merci à David pour tout le reste, et plus encore!




SEND A STABLE-LAD TO CAMBRIDGE





Help Christian finance his first year at Cambridge: he will bring Plato to the street!


Plato will tell you more about it on Platosphere




 EN FRANÇAIS!
Who am I?





Christian Keime, born in the East of France, living in
  Marseille. Working for several years as a stable-lad, a rider, a teacher, a
  publisher and a musician, I kept studying Plato's dialogues. Today, I take part in academic gatherings and am experimenting a new way of
  presenting Plato to the general public, by giving conferences, building a
  website, and making a broadcast: ""Plato talks to the kids"". Learn more about me ?






Where am I heading for?
I have been
admitted to Cambridge (UK) for a three-year PhD program starting in January 2015. In my thesis, I
want to show that Plato’s Symposium delivers lessons in communication and pedagogy.



Learn more about my thesis project?






Symposium scene, Paestum, Italy, around 500 B. C. E.



Why Cambridge?
Today,
Cambridge University is the best place to carry out such an interdisciplinary study that spans philosophy, literature and communication theory. It is also the place
where I have met the largest number of scholars working on Plato’s Symposium. 
At the end
of my PhD, I have planned three study
trips to Germany and the United-States in order to work with other Plato specialists.

And why a PhD?






 To carry on with my research on communication at university: I wish to investigate other Platonic dialogues and other authors.




            






       





 To communicate my research to a broad audience: both students and anyone interested in Antiquity and philosophy. A doctorate from Cambridge will give credibility and authority to my current educational action.





           Raphael, The School of Athens, around 1510. 



Support me, Platosphere will thank you!
In order to
present my project and to thank the generous donors, I am now giving
conferences on Plato and introducing Plato to everyone through a website: “Platosphere”.
Tomorrow, if I can carry on with my work, Platosphere could be a bilingual reference
website on Plato, helping both scholars and students, and also presenting Plato
to non specialists in layman’s terms. Then you will realise that Plato is accessible,
often witty, and that he even knows how to speak to kids.
Send a stable-lad off to university: you will bring Plato into the marketplace!



Théodore Géricault, The Race of the Riderless Horses, 1817.

Where does your money go?




Cost of the first
  year of PhD studies at Cambridge:
university
  fees (36%), accommodation (27%), and maintenance (37%)
 


25 000 €




Already funded (publishing):


17 000 €




Remaining
  gap :


8 000 €




Risks and challenges
A lot of money needs to be raised. But it's possible! If I can finance my first year of studies, it will be easier to fund the remaining ones:


thanks to
your support, more donors will trust my project, particularly private
companies and foundations.

thanks to
my experience of crowdfunding, next year I'll be able to launch a more successful campaign.

many job
opportunities are offered to Cambridge students, particularly during holidays.

youths in any community urban or suburban to make them better citizens in our

important to me, because the community of Wilmington, along with the
surrounding communities, needs something like this. Our cleanup of the existing park and then our planned state of the art
indoor/outdoor complex ,will afford more kids, more opportunities. We will be
unique, in that we will service all student-athletes, boys and girls, and help
them build the foundation and skills to be successful ,in both sports and in
life. Our programs will stress student first, and athlete second. We will
require that all of our participating student athletes, maintain a minimum
grade point average, in order to take part In our programs. Those that are
behind, but want to put forth the effort, will be helped, so that they can
participate eventually. We will help teach discipline, work ethic, and respect,
besides teaching the proper sports techniques, in order to help make  our
student athletes more successful, in their chosen sport. Our programs will help
guide all student athletes ,from the youth stage, through High School, with the
goal of helping all of them, in getting academic, and athletic scholarships.
There are many opportunities out there, and when I say that, I know that the
reality is, that most kids, in any chosen sport, are not going to get Division
1 scholarships, but it is far from the end of the world. There are thousands of
schools out there(D1, D2, D3, and so on). Kids need to know this, and be guided
towards those opportunities. Our programs will focus on seeing all of our
Student Athletes through ,the entire process. Everything we do, will be geared
towards helping all of our kids achieve success well beyond high School.
 There is nothing like what we will have to offer, in all of Southern
California. We will be able to reach many kids ,and help afford them
opportunities, they didn't know they had. </font></p><h3>Gary Kern- Chairman Of The Board:   </h3><p></p><p>Gary

the schools, from Wilmington Jr. High to Banning High School to
Harbor College to Cal State Long Beach. Most in the community know
him from coaching the Banning High School softball team, directing
Senior Programs or overseeing the 18 acre Jaycee Sports Park. “
There
are only three Public parks in Wilmington. They have limited playing
fields. If we are able to make the following improvements (mentioned
in the campaign) to the Jaycee Fields. Wilmington Athletic Complex more Youth and
Adults would have a safe environment to participate in well organized
activities. By installing Lights and  Artificial Turf on all the
fields we more than double the number of hours of use. I think we
need to ask the Community to donate from $1.00 to $5.00 (at a time) if
we can raise $50,000 we will have the seed money needed to start the
process.” says Gary Kern. Mr. Kern is also a Vietnam Veteran

Afterwards, were seeking corporations,
private investors, Foundations, Professional organization &amp; Athletes,
Grants and any able person that will see the value of developing a complete
vision of what a sports complex should provide for all youth sports along with
a parent friendly environment for everyone. A Modern sports park in 2017 is the goal. </p><ul></ul><p>Our Organization is seeking $50,000 to develop and manage a team to seed this important venture. Eventually, we will developed sports and academic programs that will prepare our youth to the next
level to college, trade &amp; certifications schools, and other academic
training. We will do that through sponsors, corporate partners and others. </p>
<p>The Funds will go to cleaning up and organizing the Jaycee Fields, a valuable part of the community of South Bay Los Angeles. It is needed now more than ever; the sports park is operating at 30% of it's capacity.</p><ul><ul></ul></ul><p>The community will benefit
from having an options in the community:</p><p>We'll be able to offer the following services to all of the South Bay: </p><p>Football : Tackle Football, Flag Football Leagues, High School Football</p><p>Soccer: Soccer Leages: Intramural Sports, High School Soccer, Clinics</p><p>Baseball/Softball: Leagues, Intramural Sports, HS/College, Clinics</p><p>Volleyball: Tournaments, Volleyball Leagues, Clinics, Intramural </p>
<p>Shareholders will feel a
sense of pride and satisfaction about their contribution in creating a positive
investment in the lives of many youths. It's not monetary, it's for the youth of the South Bay.</p>
<p>I
was a Co-Founder of another Sports group made up of former Professional
Athletes, business men, coaches and volunteers which focused on football camps
&amp; clinic in the local communities. The organization became successful in
bringing former and Professional athletes together to encourage and run
football camp each year in various cities. The goal was to promote sports and
academic for the community and encourage young men to work hard in school to
prepare them for college or other trade schools. </p><p>With our USAIOS project we
will have our own location to encompass all the sports not just football plus
an academic/college bound program to add more value to our community.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/214424/files/20131121113140-Kids_Soccer_Turf.png?1385062300"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">From Mike Alexander: </span></p><p></p><p>With contributions, we

After 3 years of waiting, a 30 year lease has been signed.)(View from the Middle of the Football/ Soccer Fields. The fields need new Sod inserts to make them more presentable and ready for league play. Not necessarily expensive but time consuming and requires on site management which will be provided)(The Restroom facilities above - The USAIOS plans are to create permanent restroom facilities for the parents and kids that will frequent the park)(The sponsors on the baseball gates are unknown - plans are to centralize sponsor solicitations and organize them through a non - profit organization for the park.

More bleachers need to be added to make it more for league play on weekend. Great Space for weekend tournaments. By this time next year it will be a vibrant plance to watch sports)(All of the Graffiti around the park needs to be taken off the dumpsters and surrounding areas.

With new slurry seal and striping, and a new entry way sign, this park is positioned to be the best outdoor sports park in South Bay Los Angeles. Organization and focus is needed to turn it around) ( The Volleyball Sand Courts need to be re-sanded and the 3rd Sand Volleyball Court needs to be initiated to maximize this site. An excellent but underused asset of the park)In 6 months, what has been lost for 39 years, can finally be put to good use for the entire community. ""The Outdoor Sports"" answer for the Children and High Schools, Leagues and Sports Organizations of South Bay Los Angeles.The Jaycee Fields Sports Park will become The USA Institute Of Sports serving the South Bay area.The children of the South Bay, primarily the areas of Wilmington and Carson are all currently being underserved. There are no outdoor sports outlets in the effective area of South Bay Los Angeles. The two main sports centers which are ""Velocity"" in the South Bay and the ""American Sports Center"" in Orange County have NO OUTDOOR FIELDS. Many organizations in the South Bay are renting fields, negotiating piece meal arrangements or simply cancelling leagues due to the lack of space. Not any longer. Former New York Giant Mike Alexander and his team have a plan to turn things around in 6 months. The team got  together 3 years ago for the benefit of the children in the community. McCann Utu Gary Kern and Mike Alexander put together their minds and efforts and created the United States Institute Of Sports. A non-profit foundation that will clean up the field, organize it for league and community use and eventually, transition it into a moder sports park and training facility benefting the youth of Los Angeles for future generations to come. They have spoken with architects, planners and have begun plans for 2017 and beyond to create what will be a modern indoor/outdoor sports park from the existing 18 acres. For the next 6 months; they will basically turn things around. ABOUT THE GUYS: McCann Lototele Utu-Born in

Proud Father of two boys McCann Jr, & Josiah Utu. I am very proud of my football background and my Samoan heritage. Being an athlete has changed my life. An athlete, artist and educator for life. (McCann Utu Number 66 on the field)Mike Alexander: Raised in Wilmington, CA.  Attended Banning High

years.  He has been married to his wife for 20 years, and has three

me because sports have kept me mentally and physically healthy and helped me
overcome obstacles in my life. It taught me how to work harder and fight for
what I wanted to accomplish in my life. I’m still enduring and working toward
my goal today. I strongle believe that this project will be able to help many
youths in any community urban or suburban to make them better citizens in our
society if they are taught early the ethics and morals of sports. In Addition, the importance of building character, also our eventual project will bring both sports
and academics together to give our youth the opportunity to earn a
scholarship to get an education. There’s no guarantee but every youth that
takes advantage of our vision will gain something positive that will help them
in shaping them become better person.Mike Alexander- COOIn his own words:This project is
important to me, because the community of Wilmington, along with the
surrounding communities, needs something like this. Our cleanup of the existing park and then our planned state of the art
indoor/outdoor complex ,will afford more kids, more opportunities. We will be
unique, in that we will service all student-athletes, boys and girls, and help
them build the foundation and skills to be successful ,in both sports and in
life. Our programs will stress student first, and athlete second. We will
require that all of our participating student athletes, maintain a minimum
grade point average, in order to take part In our programs. Those that are
behind, but want to put forth the effort, will be helped, so that they can
participate eventually. We will help teach discipline, work ethic, and respect,
besides teaching the proper sports techniques, in order to help make  our
student athletes more successful, in their chosen sport. Our programs will help
guide all student athletes ,from the youth stage, through High School, with the
goal of helping all of them, in getting academic, and athletic scholarships.
There are many opportunities out there, and when I say that, I know that the
reality is, that most kids, in any chosen sport, are not going to get Division
1 scholarships, but it is far from the end of the world. There are thousands of
schools out there(D1, D2, D3, and so on). Kids need to know this, and be guided
towards those opportunities. Our programs will focus on seeing all of our
Student Athletes through ,the entire process. Everything we do, will be geared
towards helping all of our kids achieve success well beyond high School.
 There is nothing like what we will have to offer, in all of Southern
California. We will be able to reach many kids ,and help afford them
opportunities, they didn't know they had. Gary Kern- Chairman Of The Board:   Gary
Kern was born and raised in Wilmington, California he attended all of
the schools, from Wilmington Jr. High to Banning High School to
Harbor College to Cal State Long Beach. Most in the community know
him from coaching the Banning High School softball team, directing
Senior Programs or overseeing the 18 acre Jaycee Sports Park. “
There
are only three Public parks in Wilmington. They have limited playing
fields. If we are able to make the following improvements (mentioned
in the campaign) to the Jaycee Fields. Wilmington Athletic Complex more Youth and
Adults would have a safe environment to participate in well organized
activities. By installing Lights and  Artificial Turf on all the
fields we more than double the number of hours of use. I think we
need to ask the Community to donate from $1.00 to $5.00 (at a time) if
we can raise $50,000 we will have the seed money needed to start the
process.” says Gary Kern. Mr. Kern is also a Vietnam Veteran
drafted in 1966. 
WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL ACHIEVE: From McCann Utu:Initially, we're looking for funds to just clean up the park and get it organized. Afterwards, were seeking corporations,
private investors, Foundations, Professional organization & Athletes,
Grants and any able person that will see the value of developing a complete
vision of what a sports complex should provide for all youth sports along with
a parent friendly environment for everyone. A Modern sports park in 2017 is the goal. Our Organization is seeking $50,000 to develop and manage a team to seed this important venture. Eventually, we will developed sports and academic programs that will prepare our youth to the next
level to college, trade & certifications schools, and other academic
training. We will do that through sponsors, corporate partners and others. 
The Funds will go to cleaning up and organizing the Jaycee Fields, a valuable part of the community of South Bay Los Angeles. It is needed now more than ever; the sports park is operating at 30% of it's capacity.The community will benefit
from having an options in the community:We'll be able to offer the following services to all of the South Bay: Football : Tackle Football, Flag Football Leagues, High School FootballSoccer: Soccer Leages: Intramural Sports, High School Soccer, ClinicsBaseball/Softball: Leagues, Intramural Sports, HS/College, ClinicsVolleyball: Tournaments, Volleyball Leagues, Clinics, Intramural 
Shareholders will feel a
sense of pride and satisfaction about their contribution in creating a positive
investment in the lives of many youths. It's not monetary, it's for the youth of the South Bay.
I
was a Co-Founder of another Sports group made up of former Professional
Athletes, business men, coaches and volunteers which focused on football camps
& clinic in the local communities. The organization became successful in
bringing former and Professional athletes together to encourage and run
football camp each year in various cities. The goal was to promote sports and
academic for the community and encourage young men to work hard in school to
prepare them for college or other trade schools. With our USAIOS project we
will have our own location to encompass all the sports not just football plus
an academic/college bound program to add more value to our community.From Mike Alexander: With contributions, we
will be able to become a pillar , and a safe haven in the community ,for our
Youth, and will be able to help guide and help them, so that they can realize
dreams, they may have thought to be impossible. We will empower our youth. We
will be able to positively impact our community of Wilmington, and all
surrounding communities for years and years to come. We will be able to
establish, and leave a  positive legacy, that will continue, long after we
are gone. This will enable us to really give back, and make a difference.
 Words almost cant describe the magnitude of the park and it's long term
benefits to all.I believe these benefits, will go beyond anything I can even
imagine at this point. That's how big this is . Bigger than me, or any one
person involved.  I am humbled to have this opportunity, to be able to be
a part of something, that will help so many for such a long period of time. This is my dream.What We NeedWe need $50,000 Dollars to make it all happen. For 6 months of work it's $2.77 a day, less than a large coffee and bagel at Starbucks. In order to make a difference. The funding will go to three primary uses:1. Cleaning up the park, and organizing it for maximum use for the community.       a. Setting up a trailer in the center of the park for 6 months; use it as a central operations center for the management of the site. Make sure all of the ""bro commerce"" stops on the field and it's organized into a park that is well managed and run.    b. Begin the cleanup, repainting, re-striping and sod replacement on the fields. Refilling cracked sidewalks, replacing trash cans, overall, making the place look orderly and organized.    c.Begin Merchandise development - T- Shirts- Baseball hats, Hoodies and sell them to spur local awareness as well as raise funds for the cleanup effort. 2. Organize the park to become part of the Local Community. Make the park a valuable asset for the formation of leagues and sports initiatives in the local community of South Bay Los Angeles.    a. Start a social media outreach program connect to the 25 nearest high schools, indoor sports parks, and football, soccer and volleyball leagues.    b. Reach out to the Wilmington Boys and Girls Club nearby. Make them feel like part of the effort, coordinate fundraising and charity events with them as non-profit partners.     c. Work with the City of Wilmington, develop a plan that suits into what the parks and recreation department sees as the biggest need of the Carson/Wilmington area. 3. Create a Grand Opening Event to Showcase the New Park to the South Bay area.    a. Through Social Media, develop a database of enthusiasts for the park and constantly send them updates every 30 days.    b. Contact all of the VIP's in the area- get them excited about how this is benefiting the area youth.    c. Start the design and construction renderings of the new layout and modern park that will take place in the future. Speak to sponsors about underwriting the development costs and seek financing simulteanously.(Concept Park from Architects. Over the next 12 months, the USAIOS working alongside corporate partners will develop a new vision for the Wilmington Sports Complex /Jaycee fields to create a USAIOS field for South Bay LA by 2017)What You GetContributors to the USAIOS will get a ton of gear.

Pride- The pride of putting 110% into your efforts, every time. 4. Self Esteem - Sports accomplishments give children self worth. 5.   Education- Excellence in Sports usually translates to the Class Room.The most important lessons in life are FREE. Mike Alexander and McCann Utu have built successful businesses and successful lives for themselves in the area. They have worked with children of all ages and most importantly, have been born and raised in the South Bay Los Angeles area. You can drive down to 1700 Figueroa Street in Wilmington, CA and tour the 18 acre site for yourself.

result of my work with more than 22,000 soldiers and veterans over the prior two years, many of whom were struggling with suicidal ideation. As I write
these words, 11 December 2013, my heart is heavy for three soldiers I have
intervened for in the past 48 hours. 
They are safe for now, but so many more do not get help and feel as if
they are all alone.  AFM’s mission is “Building

<p>Three of many stories I could tell you illustrate how lives are changed because of training.  Lynn is
a retired Navy Commander.  He received a
call 16 days after taking the workshop. 
He said, “Because of the workshop, I realized the person I was talking
with was suicidal.  I discovered that she
had attempted suicide three days earlier. 
She was on the verge of a second attempt.  I
did a three-way with the Crisis Hotline and got her the immediate help she
needed.”</p>
<p>Rebecca’s son took his life in January.  She was not sure if she was ready for the
training, but she decided that she wanted to make a difference and enrolled in
the November workshop.  During a simulation exercise on the second day of training,
Rebecca was helping a person at risk come off the symbolic bridge
of hopelessness.  Other particpants had tried before
her.  But she stayed at it and was able
to help the person at risk to come down off the bridge.  In her own words, “The
Workshop has helped give me a voice to end the epidemic of suicide – one person
at a time – whoever God brings in my path.” </p>
<p>Lewis had experienced multiple losses of friends from suicide.  He was himself overwhelmed by his own

is a two-day program; 60 to 90 days of prep time are needed to publicize the event.  
Because of the tremendous support of many
individuals, families, and Community Alliance Partners, AFM was able to
celebrate the achievement of all of our first year goals for 2013 and to exceed our goals in some areas.  With your help we can do even
more in 2014.  
Together we can Stand With Them for safer
and stronger communities,

He comes from a middle class Chinese family, and through hard work, now attends a good university in Beijing. Other than pursuing his studies, he wants to help his local community. But overwhelmed by the vast landscape of NGOs in China, news reports regarding misuse of public donations, and his general sense that his efforts alone cannot change much, he drops the idea of supporting an NGO and instead focuses more intensely on academics. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Liang eventually graduates from university and starts a well-paying job at an investment bank in Shanghai. Over the course of his career at the firm he saves some money, and it occurs to him again to donate a portion of his savings to the causes he cares about. He wishes that there were some way for him to connect with other young professionals in China, to gather, exchange, and discuss ideas about trustworthy organizations that addresses causes they care about. </span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Realizing that there is no such organization, and moreover being reminded again of the fact that he by himself will not be able to make the kind of impact his boss (who had recently donated millions to a famous organization) would make, Liang decides to focus on his job, hoping that eventually he will be as wealthy as his boss so that he himself can also become a philanthropist.</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Many young people in China, whether university students or young professionals, miss the chance to support social causes early in their lives. Moreover, they do not realize that collectively over time they could make an even larger impact than a single high net-worth donor or a corporation might make. In fact, most charitable donations in China come from corporations (57%) and a comparatively small percentage (32%) comes from individuals, compared to the US (73%).

This summer, PIM will partner with the University of Hong Kong (HKU) to launch Model Foundation, a four-day conference that brings together university students to learn about and engage in intelligent charitable giving through making strategic decisions on how to distribute a PIM fund of 20,000 USD.Acting as Grant Committee Officers, student representatives from Hong Kong, China, U.S., and Singapore will be charged with selecting and assessing local nonprofits for potential funding. As a group, they will participate in a roundtable discussion and come up with a strategy to allocate a sum of 20,000 USD to organizations that they deem to be addressing youth development in a unique, innovative, and impactful way. Workshops on contemporary approaches to philanthropy, interviews with social sector leaders, and site visits to these organizations will help inform their final decision, which will then be judged by a panel of experienced philanthropists and social sector leaders for the thoroughness of evaluation and rigor of analysis.Through providing a platform for cross-cultural exchange and exploring approaches to effective giving, Model Foundation will raise the level of awareness and discourse about the social sector. Through providing a PIM fund, students form an actual young people's foundation with the power -- and also the responsibilities -- to make real impact. Students will gain a firm understanding of the inner workings of a foundation as they build leadership, analytical, and consensus-building skills. By learning and giving together in support of social projects, they enrich the communities in which they live as well as their personal lives and networks. Where The Funds Will GoWhy China? Why PIM?Imagine a typical student named Liang. He comes from a middle class Chinese family, and through hard work, now attends a good university in Beijing. Other than pursuing his studies, he wants to help his local community. But overwhelmed by the vast landscape of NGOs in China, news reports regarding misuse of public donations, and his general sense that his efforts alone cannot change much, he drops the idea of supporting an NGO and instead focuses more intensely on academics. Liang eventually graduates from university and starts a well-paying job at an investment bank in Shanghai. Over the course of his career at the firm he saves some money, and it occurs to him again to donate a portion of his savings to the causes he cares about. He wishes that there were some way for him to connect with other young professionals in China, to gather, exchange, and discuss ideas about trustworthy organizations that addresses causes they care about. Realizing that there is no such organization, and moreover being reminded again of the fact that he by himself will not be able to make the kind of impact his boss (who had recently donated millions to a famous organization) would make, Liang decides to focus on his job, hoping that eventually he will be as wealthy as his boss so that he himself can also become a philanthropist.Many young people in China, whether university students or young professionals, miss the chance to support social causes early in their lives. Moreover, they do not realize that collectively over time they could make an even larger impact than a single high net-worth donor or a corporation might make. In fact, most charitable donations in China come from corporations (57%) and a comparatively small percentage (32%) comes from individuals, compared to the US (73%). Our goal is to motivate more individuals in China to become more engaged in contributing to the social sector.                          Source: China Charity Donation Resource Center, Giving USAWhile there is a growing trend of charitable giving in China (see graph below), the overall quality of the philanthropic system lags behind due to 1) low public understanding, 2) lack of trust, and 3) insufficient support for independent small and medium NGOs.                          Source: China Charity Donation Resource CenterMany people want to help, but there are barriers preventing them from taking the first step. PIM is here to show young people like Liang that anyone and everyone in China can be a philanthropist! They can achieve more together by pooling together resources to collectively invest in trustable NGOs in a strategic manner. Let's look the etymology
 of the word ""philanthropy."" Its roots harken back to ancient Greek 
civilization and it literally means: ""For the love of humanity."" So it 
is our mission to teach young people that philanthropy is much more than the 
exclusive act of writing million dollar checks by a handful of wealthy people 
who have the power to do so, but it is about building a community and 
showing compassion. We will help young people in China 1) identify the best NGOs to donate to, 2) discuss with a group of people from diverse backgrounds to devise a strategically sound, sustainable methodology, and 3) contribute their resources, including time, money, and skills, to maximize their social impact.With our vision to make philanthropy accessible, we will bridge the gap 
between the rising young professional class and a vast landscape of NGOs
 so as to awaken a common consciousness for intelligent giving among a 
new generation of young people, in a nation that with its economic power
 will soon bear the Asian status quo.Three Ways You Can Help!1. Donate to PIM2. Join our Team  3. Spread the WordOur Team                                                                 Jasmine Lauis the

Youth 9 day leadership training course wich is scheduled for the 15th November. We need a minimum of R120 000 ($10 255) for the training to take place (30 youth at R4000- $345- per youth). Every Little bit helps! Most of Yes!Youth participants cannot afford to pay for the training, and need full or partial sponsorship. Support this campaign and help us train more youth to become active citizens.What we doWe believe that Youth have the energy and desire for a better world; by directing this energy towards positive transformation within themselves and where they live, we are building healthy, happy and self-sufficient communities. Yes!Youth is
a year-long mentorship programme that starts with a 9 day intensive
training leadership foundation course. It provides Youth with the tools, training and
support to live and stand for human values whilst developing initiatives they are passionate about and that meet the needs of communities. Yes!Youth is run under the umbrella of the

<h3><strong>1.  <em>Who We Are and What We’re Creating</em></strong></h3>
<p><strong>A.   <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Brass Family's Great Adventure: The Story</span>.</strong></p>
<p>The story of this online musical “book” is about the Brass Family: Papa Trombone, Mama French Horn, Toby Tuba and Cornetta Brass. They come to the Big City (New York?) at the turn of the last century. They manage to obtain a small tenement apartment; but they need money to survive. They each have their own tune, and go out and play in restaurants, on street corners, in the street market and in the subway; but they aren’t making enough to survive. Then they decide to do a melody where they all harmonize. This is louder and more beautiful than the individual tunes. They go to the Center of Town (5<sup>th</sup> Ave.?) and play it there. A famous bandleader hears them and hires them for his big band. And they are all very happy!  (18 pages of illustrated text).</p>
<p><strong> B.   <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Nancy L. Hoffmann: Writer, Illustrator, Designer and Educator</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Nancy has fifteen years of documentary and conceptual Illustration under her belt, along with five years as an ad agency copywriter and subsequent blogger and web content writer. Via her freelance company, TomatoDesign.Net, she has designed sites for a wide range of small businesses, utilizing her expertise as an ad agency art director and graphic designer, as well as web designer and developer. Additionally, she has a Master’s Degree in Elementary Education.</p>
<p><strong> C.    <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Clark Gayton: Brass Musician Extraordinaire</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Clark has had a long and exciting career playing every sort of music imaginable, and traveling to almost every country of the world. This summer he is playing with Bruce Springsteen’s E-Street Band’s World Tour. But he has also played and traveled with Sting (several times), The Mingus Big Band, The Skatelites, the Metropolitan Opera of NYC, Illinois Jacquet, and a great many other famous (and not so famous) musicians, as well.</p>
<p>He has expertise in both composing and arranging, and can be found playing various venues in New York City when he’s not on the road.</p>

<p>Russell is the owner of Tectite, and has enormous expertise in programming and online development. He will be a great asset to our team, as he is also a musician (woodwinds), and wants to see the cause of music education (much neglected in the USA!) advanced worldwide.</p>

<strong>2.</strong><em>  Funding and Perks (for You)!</em>
</h3>
<p><strong>A.   <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>YOUR PERKS As a Contributor (see column at right)!</em> </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute<strong> $250</strong> and your school gets free access for a year, in addition to your own <strong>FREE</strong> pass.</li>
<li>Contribute <strong>$95</strong> and 30 children or teachers from your school will get access to the site, in addition to your own FREE pass.</li>
<li>Contribute <strong>$45</strong> and your child's teacher will get access to the site to share with the class, in addition to your own FREE pass.</li>
<li>Everyone who contributes <strong>$20</strong> or more to this project will receive a <strong>FREE pass</strong> to the site (normally, you would have to get a pass for a fee @ ±$25). It will be fun for both adults or children to make their own musical arrangements!</li>
<li>The story of the Brass Family coming to the Big City (apparently New York at the turn of the last century) is carefully researched to include the look and feel of what an immigrant would have seen and experienced in that time period. Extensive research informs the illustrations, but they are done in a whimsical style (as is the music), which would appeal to children. A teacher could project the site (or DVD) to a class, and could manipulate the music with the help of the children.</li>
</ul><p><strong>B</strong><strong>.</strong><em><strong>  </strong></em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Where the Funding Will Go</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Russell</strong></span> will code this in HTML and JavaScript to make it very flexible and to work well on the iPad and other tablets.  As tablets don't have a mouse, one needs to design to adapt to a touchscreen.

<h3>3. <strong><em>Why This Project Matters!</em></strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>***  </strong><em>We are dedicated that Music and Art Education are essential to the development of every child, and we want to engage as many children as possible in the creative process.</em><strong>  ***</strong><br/><br/><strong>Children who are deprived of music education ""may never be able to meet complex challenges because their talents are undeveloped . . . If a child is dancing, drumming and singing they simply cannot fail."" — Jean Houston, Author, Teacher and Protegée of Margaret Mead.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>4. <em>Other Ways You Can Help</em>
</h3>
<p><strong>A.  <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Please Get the Word Out!</span></strong><br/><br/> We need all the tweets, FaceBook  and blog stories, Hi5’s and anything else we can get to get he word out about our endeavor. If you know any educators or people with school-age children, tell them how this will help their district and classrooms bring music and art back to their kids. They will also be able to buy the “book” online for home use.</p>

Clark has had a long and exciting career playing every sort of music imaginable, and traveling to almost every country of the world. This summer he is playing with Bruce Springsteen’s E-Street Band’s World Tour. But he has also played and traveled with Sting (several times), The Mingus Big Band, The Skatelites, the Metropolitan Opera of NYC, Illinois Jacquet, and a great many other famous (and not so famous) musicians, as well.
He has expertise in both composing and arranging, and can be found playing various venues in New York City when he’s not on the road.
 D.   Russell Robinson, Computer Scientist and Veteran Programmer.
Russell is the owner of Tectite, and has enormous expertise in programming and online development. He will be a great asset to our team, as he is also a musician (woodwinds), and wants to see the cause of music education (much neglected in the USA!) advanced worldwide.
 

2.  Funding and Perks (for You)!

A.   YOUR PERKS As a Contributor (see column at right)! 

Contribute $250 and your school gets free access for a year, in addition to your own FREE pass.
Contribute $95 and 30 children or teachers from your school will get access to the site, in addition to your own FREE pass.
Contribute $45 and your child's teacher will get access to the site to share with the class, in addition to your own FREE pass.
Everyone who contributes $20 or more to this project will receive a FREE pass to the site (normally, you would have to get a pass for a fee @ ±$25). It will be fun for both adults or children to make their own musical arrangements!
The story of the Brass Family coming to the Big City (apparently New York at the turn of the last century) is carefully researched to include the look and feel of what an immigrant would have seen and experienced in that time period. Extensive research informs the illustrations, but they are done in a whimsical style (as is the music), which would appeal to children. A teacher could project the site (or DVD) to a class, and could manipulate the music with the help of the children.
B.  Where the Funding Will Go
Russell will code this in HTML and JavaScript to make it very flexible and to work well on the iPad and other tablets.  As tablets don't have a mouse, one needs to design to adapt to a touchscreen. Snippets of audio, moving characters, etc. are all possible with these basic technologies.Nancy would be researching, writing and illustrating in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator: 18-20 pages. Clark would be composing, arranging and digitizing the music for the site. This would require an investment in both equipment and hours.
C.   Our Track Record Russell Robinson is the owner of www.tectite.com, and author of Tectite FormMail, an anti-spam PHP form processor with a long history.: see http://digg.com/newsbar/topnews/tectite_formmail_forms_processing for free form scripts. You can follow him at https://twitter.com/#!/tectitecom and get even more great information! Lastly, his LinkedIn page is http://www.linkedin.com/pub/russell-robinson/15/606/b9.
Nancy L. Hoffmann has successfully created many web sites over the years (see her site, http://tomatodesign.net for some examples), in addition to her extensive advertising and illustration careers. Her blog is http://tomatogreening.com and her Facebook page is http://www.facebook.com/nancy.hoffmann.Clark Gayton has free music, tour dates, videos and photos at http://www.myspace.com/clarkgayton. You can also read his biography at Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gayton. His Facebook pages is http://www.facebook.com/pages/Clark-Gayton/30836069726; and there is more about him at http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/clarkgayton. Sting calls him a consummate musician and says that Clark is part of his “musical family.” Need we say more?
D.   What If We Don’t Reach Our Entire Goal? If we don’t reach our entire goal of US$55,000 by July 29, we will apply the money we have to the project and see how far we can get with it. Then we will try to raise funds again.
 
3. Why This Project Matters!

***  We are dedicated that Music and Art Education are essential to the development of every child, and we want to engage as many children as possible in the creative process.  ***Children who are deprived of music education ""may never be able to meet complex challenges because their talents are undeveloped . . . If a child is dancing, drumming and singing they simply cannot fail."" — Jean Houston, Author, Teacher and Protegée of Margaret Mead.
 
4. Other Ways You Can Help

A.  Please Get the Word Out! We need all the tweets, FaceBook  and blog stories, Hi5’s and anything else we can get to get he word out about our endeavor. If you know any educators or people with school-age children, tell them how this will help their district and classrooms bring music and art back to their kids. They will also be able to buy the “book” online for home use.
 B.   Please Don’t Forget to Use the Indiegogo Share Tools to Get the Word Out!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This campaign has been created to help out a good friend of ours. For years, Casey has been building a dream: A place for all his friends and familiy (and even strangers) to get together for good times and to make memories. He has put his heart and soul into building the perfect place, complete with fully functioning vintage pinball machines lining the walls, a lounge with couches, a barbeque, and even a bar. He has always offered this ""Mancave"" as a place for people to hold their parties, free of charge or obligation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hard times have fallen on us all, and now Casey needs us to help keep this dream alive. A few of us have gotten together to help Casey pay the rent and keep this amazing place from becoming only a memory.</p>
<p>Your contributions will allow a dream to live on. A place where anyone is welcome with open arms!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise enough money to cover the rent for next 6 months. This will give Casey enough time to get back on his feet without losing his special place. All of the $5000 requested will go directly to the rent and utilities only.</p>
<p>In exchange for your generosity, you will have the opportunity to select one of the great perks we have listed to the right side of this screen! These perks are Pinball/Mancave based and some of this stuff is not readily available to the public.</p>
<p>Even if our entire goal is not reached, any funds received will go directly to the Mancave's rent and utility bills.</p>

<div>      <strong>TEACHER ATTACKED AND INJURED BY STUDENT - IN THE CLASSROOM!</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dear Donors,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My name is (Ms.) Lorna Beach-Mathura. I am a former certified teacher employed by the Miami-Dade County Public Schools system in Miami, Florida, USA. I AM A VICTIM OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE - THE STUDENT-ON-TEACHER KIND.</div>
<p>I became a teacher to answer the urgent call and need for certified teachers in South Florida. My subject areas were English and Journalism. I wanted to teach students to read and write. It was my contibution to the community and a way to give something back.</p>
<p>I was six months pregnant with my fourth child when I was approached by an Assistant Principal to work in the school that my sons attended. They desperately needed someone to work as a Substitute Locator. This job entails locating substitute teachers to temporarily fill the positions of absent teachers on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Although I was currently enrolled as a Masters Degree candidate at a local private university, I agreed to do the job. I worked from home in the mornings and on the weekends, and I worked at the school in the evenings. It was a challenging and stressful job, but on the whole I was able to cover many of the teacher absences.</p>
<p>When it was apparent that the need for more teachers was indeed great, I decided to become certified and teach full-time.</p>
<p>I was first abused (slapped ferociously) by a 6 yr. old kindergarten student (a boy) who had a violent temper. He slapped me about six times on my arm and leg when I told him to sit quietly and do his assignment. He had been very disruptive and was annoying the other students. I stood there in shock as this little kid slapped me over and over again, and I never fought back.</p>
<p>I was covering for the absent teacher and no one had told me about him beforehand. I later learned that he had ""pulled scissors"" on other kindergarten teachers, and thrown down desks and chairs in every classroom in which he was placed.  They were all afraid of him. My skin stung for more than six months after that slapping incident. I got a lot of pain from the slapping. He received a 10 day suspension.</p>
<p>This was my first introduction to school violence against teachers (in elementary school), and it was very painful. I would later be cursed out in high school  (see my school identification card), and stepped on, grabbed, yelled at, and pushed and shoved in middle school.</p>
<p>I endured all of the abuses and bullying with the steadfast aim of making a positive difference in the lives of the children of my community. But alas, my good deeds and good intentions would be punished and my teaching career would be cut short.</p>
<p>On March 1st, 2005, while proctoring a State of Florida mandated test, I was viciously and violently attacked by a male middle school student named Zackery Ba-Mungin. He disrupted the test and annoyed the other students by walking in and out of class without permission. On his last re-entry, I met him at the door and asked him to stay there. He began pushing and shoving me until I became wedged between the heavy metal door and the door jamb.</p>
<p>As I struggled to close the door he stuck his foot into the doorway and began to body-slam me. This struggle lasted for 3 to 4 minutes while I asked him to stop hurting me. He did not stop until another teacher appeared in the doorway of another classroom. As I called out for help, Zackery finally stopped.</p>
<p>He was arrested that day and charged with FELONY BATTERY ON A SCHOOL OFFICIAL, while I was sent to the doctor. I sustained a broken neck, broken back, and a contusion to my right shoulder. That was the end of my teaching career, although I did not know it then.</p>
<p>It took Zackery Ba-Mungin two years to plead guilty to battering me. But, he never showed up for sentencing the following month. He has not been punished. There was a bench warrant issued in the case. So, instead of him being punished, I was punished.</p>
<p>My job was terminated while I was on approved leave of absence due to injuries I sustained. I had to pay for most of my medical care and physical therapy treatments. I had to seek out doctors who could help me recover. Yet, I am still not recovered. I had to pay for pain medications. I ingested thousands of pills; endured hundreds of needle injections; made over 200 trips to various doctor appointments, and visited a psychologist and psychiatrist several times for therapy and medications. It was torture.</p>
<p>All of this was paid for out-of-pocket  by me. The School Board refused to authorize the treatments that were needed to help me get better. Its refusal to help me made my conditions worse. I was also treated like the criminal, although I was the victim of a crime ON SCHOOL PROPERTY. Its lawyers investigated me, poked around in my personal affairs, vilified me among other lawyers and my own doctors, and disrespected and denied me at every level.</p>
<p>The School Board's agents refused to give me proper medical care as mandated by the workers' compensation laws of Florida. They also owe me for several years of monetary benefits that I need, especially now. To date, The Board's administration has paid one outside lawyer over $50,000 to avoid paying me the lost wages benefits that I am lawfully owed.</p>
<p>Because of the physical attack, and the resulting injuries, I have been left with severe chronic pain and mental depressionm among other maladies. My disabilities have taken a huge toll on me and my family life, income, career, and every aspect of my life. The pain is the worst, especially during stressful times like now.</p>
<p>I would just like to say that I was a good teacher, and I have outstanding teaching performance evaluations. I have never had any disciplinary problems, and I showed up to work on time and regularly. I treated my students well. I bought them treats and school supplies. I also taught them manners and tips on courtesy and politeness. However, as you read before,  Zackery Ba Mungin did not behave in accordance with my teachings. He missed a lot of time from school, so he may have been absent when the lessons were taught.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Within recent months, I have fallen behind on my mortgage payments. The cost of everything has increased, and I have had to start repaying my $180,000+ in student loans. The monthly payment is $876 for two two loans. These loans were taken out to pay for the advanced degrees I would have needed to become a school administrator.  With the increased income, I would have been able to repay the loans, but I was thwarted in my attempts to better myself, and the lives of students in Miami-Dade County, Florida.</p>
<p>The following are the things I need at this time:</p>
<p>               I need  enough money to place a downpayment of 20% (or $30,000 USD) on a modest, single family house that i wish to purchase. </p>
<p>               Some of the money will be used to pay the very pressing bills that I have had to ignore due to lack of money.</p>

      TEACHER ATTACKED AND INJURED BY STUDENT - IN THE CLASSROOM!

 
Dear Donors,
 
My name is (Ms.) Lorna Beach-Mathura. I am a former certified teacher employed by the Miami-Dade County Public Schools system in Miami, Florida, USA. I AM A VICTIM OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE - THE STUDENT-ON-TEACHER KIND.
I became a teacher to answer the urgent call and need for certified teachers in South Florida. My subject areas were English and Journalism. I wanted to teach students to read and write. It was my contibution to the community and a way to give something back.
I was six months pregnant with my fourth child when I was approached by an Assistant Principal to work in the school that my sons attended. They desperately needed someone to work as a Substitute Locator. This job entails locating substitute teachers to temporarily fill the positions of absent teachers on a daily basis.
Although I was currently enrolled as a Masters Degree candidate at a local private university, I agreed to do the job. I worked from home in the mornings and on the weekends, and I worked at the school in the evenings. It was a challenging and stressful job, but on the whole I was able to cover many of the teacher absences.
When it was apparent that the need for more teachers was indeed great, I decided to become certified and teach full-time.
I was first abused (slapped ferociously) by a 6 yr. old kindergarten student (a boy) who had a violent temper. He slapped me about six times on my arm and leg when I told him to sit quietly and do his assignment. He had been very disruptive and was annoying the other students. I stood there in shock as this little kid slapped me over and over again, and I never fought back.
I was covering for the absent teacher and no one had told me about him beforehand. I later learned that he had ""pulled scissors"" on other kindergarten teachers, and thrown down desks and chairs in every classroom in which he was placed.  They were all afraid of him. My skin stung for more than six months after that slapping incident. I got a lot of pain from the slapping. He received a 10 day suspension.
This was my first introduction to school violence against teachers (in elementary school), and it was very painful. I would later be cursed out in high school  (see my school identification card), and stepped on, grabbed, yelled at, and pushed and shoved in middle school.
I endured all of the abuses and bullying with the steadfast aim of making a positive difference in the lives of the children of my community. But alas, my good deeds and good intentions would be punished and my teaching career would be cut short.
On March 1st, 2005, while proctoring a State of Florida mandated test, I was viciously and violently attacked by a male middle school student named Zackery Ba-Mungin. He disrupted the test and annoyed the other students by walking in and out of class without permission. On his last re-entry, I met him at the door and asked him to stay there. He began pushing and shoving me until I became wedged between the heavy metal door and the door jamb.
As I struggled to close the door he stuck his foot into the doorway and began to body-slam me. This struggle lasted for 3 to 4 minutes while I asked him to stop hurting me. He did not stop until another teacher appeared in the doorway of another classroom. As I called out for help, Zackery finally stopped.
He was arrested that day and charged with FELONY BATTERY ON A SCHOOL OFFICIAL, while I was sent to the doctor. I sustained a broken neck, broken back, and a contusion to my right shoulder. That was the end of my teaching career, although I did not know it then.
It took Zackery Ba-Mungin two years to plead guilty to battering me. But, he never showed up for sentencing the following month. He has not been punished. There was a bench warrant issued in the case. So, instead of him being punished, I was punished.
My job was terminated while I was on approved leave of absence due to injuries I sustained. I had to pay for most of my medical care and physical therapy treatments. I had to seek out doctors who could help me recover. Yet, I am still not recovered. I had to pay for pain medications. I ingested thousands of pills; endured hundreds of needle injections; made over 200 trips to various doctor appointments, and visited a psychologist and psychiatrist several times for therapy and medications. It was torture.
All of this was paid for out-of-pocket  by me. The School Board refused to authorize the treatments that were needed to help me get better. Its refusal to help me made my conditions worse. I was also treated like the criminal, although I was the victim of a crime ON SCHOOL PROPERTY. Its lawyers investigated me, poked around in my personal affairs, vilified me among other lawyers and my own doctors, and disrespected and denied me at every level.
The School Board's agents refused to give me proper medical care as mandated by the workers' compensation laws of Florida. They also owe me for several years of monetary benefits that I need, especially now. To date, The Board's administration has paid one outside lawyer over $50,000 to avoid paying me the lost wages benefits that I am lawfully owed.
Because of the physical attack, and the resulting injuries, I have been left with severe chronic pain and mental depressionm among other maladies. My disabilities have taken a huge toll on me and my family life, income, career, and every aspect of my life. The pain is the worst, especially during stressful times like now.
I would just like to say that I was a good teacher, and I have outstanding teaching performance evaluations. I have never had any disciplinary problems, and I showed up to work on time and regularly. I treated my students well. I bought them treats and school supplies. I also taught them manners and tips on courtesy and politeness. However, as you read before,  Zackery Ba Mungin did not behave in accordance with my teachings. He missed a lot of time from school, so he may have been absent when the lessons were taught.
 


What We Need & What You Get
Within recent months, I have fallen behind on my mortgage payments. The cost of everything has increased, and I have had to start repaying my $180,000+ in student loans. The monthly payment is $876 for two two loans. These loans were taken out to pay for the advanced degrees I would have needed to become a school administrator.  With the increased income, I would have been able to repay the loans, but I was thwarted in my attempts to better myself, and the lives of students in Miami-Dade County, Florida.
The following are the things I need at this time:
               I need  enough money to place a downpayment of 20% (or $30,000 USD) on a modest, single family house that i wish to purchase. 
               Some of the money will be used to pay the very pressing bills that I have had to ignore due to lack of money.
               Since we have to move to another, less expensive county in Florida, I have to pay relocation or moving expenses - rental truck, movers, gas, etc.  We have to move by the end of July, 2012.
               I will also use  some of the money to help other teachers who have been mistreated in the workplace and have lost their jobs. 
As a totally and permanently disabled former teacher, I can no longer work. The monthly disability income that I currently receive is a quarter of the salary I made before my job was snatched away from me.
PERKS:
$100.00 or more.
          In 1993, I participated in the recording of a compact disc (CD) that falls within the category of ""Cool Jazz"" or""New Adult Contemporary"" music.  I shall award copies to donors of $100.00 or higher - as long as supplies last.
$20.00 to $99.00  
        For the people who do not live in Florida, or those who have never been to any of the attractions that the Sunshine State has to offer, I will award various memorabilia. These range from: caps, t-shirts, key chains, postcards, buttons, or any other licensed items from Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World,etc. in Orlando.

If the $50,000.00 goal is not reached, I shall still use any money donated to pay bills or for the partial downpayment on a home.

<p>The Young family was preparing to go on vacation in June, 2011 when a tragedy struck. Thirty-three-year-old Kara Martinez left her daughter in the family room for just a moment.</p>
<p>""When I came out of the restroom something told me to look for her. When I went to the back porch I found my daughter lying in the pool.""</p>
<p>One year old Savannah Young was blue in the face and not responding. The toddler's grandmother, Karen Young, has a nursing background and started CPR immediately.</p>
<p>Karen Young said, ""She was breathing when the medics got here and her oxygen level was 98 percent.""</p>
<p>When Savannah was taken away, something went wrong.</p>
<p>Kara Martinez  was told, ""During helicopter transport to the hospital, Savannah's status began to decline""</p>
<p>Now three-year-old Savannah is disabled. She eats through a feeding tube and needs full time care.</p>
<p>Martinez says her daughter, ""Can't sit up by herself... she can't hold her head up... no walking, talking, crawling. The only thing she can do really is hear.""</p>
<p>M.artinez is now trying to get help to pay for medical treatments that might restore some of Savannah's brain functions.</p>
<p>Kara says when her father had the pool installed, he asked the contractor to include the best pool fence they had.  On the day of the accident, one of the latches did not close properly.</p>
<p>""You have to be careful. Anything can happen in the split second. We had security gates. We had locks on the doors. We thought we did everything we could to make sure this wouldn't happen and it did,"" Martinez explains.</p>
<p>Kara says she has one wish that she hopes will come true someday.</p>
<p>""I would love to have a full recovery, but just to have my little girl look at me and say mommy one more time would mean the world to me. This is something you take granted and miss it terribly when it is gone."" </p>

<p>He was born with a hole in his heart, and by the time he was six months old he had had two major heart surgeries as featured in this news paper article following his doctors tragic death:</p>

<p>Upon my brothers 2 heart surgeries before he was even a year old, he then had another at 4 years old, and every time they had to operate it was like taking a deep breath, and holding it, not being able to exhale, until he made it out okay.</p>
<p>At the age of 6 he was tested, and was advanced in his education, he was a gifted child.  </p>
<p>Slowly as the work got harder, my mom began to see a change in his grades. They began to fall hard, and upon his 10 year checkup, we realized that he was slightly brain damaged and had a black hole in his brain.</p>
<p>He needs developmental help from a special school. If he is placed in the regular school system, he has no future, as he cannot keep up at that pace yet. The school that we hope to enroll him in will prepare him for regular school, and teach and nuture him back to being at that level again. This ""gifted"" child has a bright future. We just need help in placing him in the right environment so that he can flourish and progress at his pace. Our family cannot afford this tuition, it is way too high, and that is why I am asking for help from everyone.</p>

This is for our trip to the national HOSA leadership conference!  We both made it for the Kaiser Permanente test, and Macknzie also made it for taking 2nd place in the state medical spelling competition!
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need $1,700 please!  This will go towards our flight, hotel, conference fees and food of course! 
We don't have much to give back, but we will send you a thank you via Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, etc.

The Impact
We hope that this will help get us a step up in the medical field.  It will hopefully make us stand out on our college applications so that we can get into a great school to further our medical careers.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<p><strong>“Boy you’re going to college one way or the other. Either you get an academic or athletic scholarship, but you’re going to school and I can’t afford to send you!”</strong></p>
<p>Those were my Dad's words to me as he dropped me of at the Boy's Club.  My name is Andre (Dré) Woolridge and I am a native of Omaha, Nebraska. I learned the fundamentals of basketball at the age of seven at the local Boy's Club of America.</p>
<p>Sadly, today athletics remain the only way for some to go to college, especially with the rising cost of higher education. But I am here to assist them through basketball!</p>
<p>Basketball is my passion! Basketball has allowed me to to follow a path to higher education, offered me the opportunity to see the world, and broadened my horizons.  Basketball's training and discipline helped me build self-esteem and confidence that I use to this day.  It was an escape from gangs and other pitfalls within the inner-city.  Every kid can benefit from the discipline and work ethic I teach no matter their chosen course in life.  Basketball gives me a unique chance to start my own small business and help our youth in the greater Sacramento area.  </p>
<p>As a high school student athlete, I led my team to the Nebraska Class A State Championship title. I was All State and I am still the Class A all time leading scorer. I received a full scholarship to the University Nebraska and transferred to the University of Iowa after my first year. As a Hawkeye I was named first team All-Big Ten and third team All-American by the Associated Press my senior season.</p>
<p>After graduating from Iowa in 1997, I enjoyed an extensive career playing professional basketball overseas.  I have played professionally in Turkey, France, Germany, Venezuela, Israel and Italy.</p>
<p>In 2007, I had the honor of being inducted to the Nebraska High School Sports Hall of Fame and the Nebraska Black Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.</p>
<p>I want to share my basketball expertise and worldy experience with the youth of the greater Sacramento community and hopefully nationwide.</p>

<h2>Anne Frank's Iowa Connection</h2>
<p> <img alt=""Anne Frank, Juanita Wager, Oceans Apart, Margot Frank, Betty Ann Wagner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/657029/pictures/original/20130211101837-Desktop-INDIE.jpg?1360606717"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><em>Oceans Apart</em></strong> was written and illustrated by two teenage girls from Burlington, Iowa, Hallie Darnall and Haley Villont.  A copy of their work is a wonderful perk for our campaign.</p>
<h3>The Wagner sisters in the corn fields of Iowa were pen pals with the Frank sisters ...</h3>
<p>Just before the Frank family went into hiding, Anne and her older sister Margot were writing letters back and forth between two sisters in Danville, Iowa named Juanita and Betty Ann Wagner. </p>
<p>The pen pal project started in Juanita's classroom when teacher Birdie Mathews asked if students would be interested in writing to children abroad.  Juanita drew the name of young Anne Frank and immediately wrote to her at an address in Amsterdam.  Juanita's and Anne's older sisters began to write one another as well. </p>
<p>Anne was an avid postcard collector and sent her new friend in Iowa a postcard from Amsterdam telling about her hobby.  In a letter from Anne to Juanita she tells of looking at a map of Iowa but not finding Danville.  Anne asked Juanita if it was close to the city of Burlington. </p>
<p>Then the Nazis invaded and the letters stopped.  The Wagner sisters had no idea the Frank sisters were Jewish but knew they were suffering in the war.  Many years later Betty Ann wrote to Margot asking if her family was all right.  It was then Otto Frank who responded letting Betty Ann know his wife and daughters died in a concentration camp.</p>
<p>Today these precious letters from Anne, Margot and Otto, are at the Simon Wiesenthal Center (a museum focused on racism and the history of the Holocaust) in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>Back in Danville there is a very humble museum where school children and visitors can come and learn about Birdie Mathew's pen pal project.  Copies of these very important letters are in Danville, Iowa.  It really amazes children to know the young (now very famous) author of a diary found a place in the heart of a little girl from hometown Iowa.</p>

<p>A new educational facility is desperately needed to share this amazing part of history for school children and adults alike.  The local fundraising has begun with a significant amount raised which will allow us to purchase the property adjoining the current museum.  We are in the final stages of this sale so soon we will have room to build.</p>
<p>Our goal is to build a new Holocaust museum with many first class exhibits.  The building project is estimated to cost $450,000.  Therefore we are launching the fundraising on this site hoping to raise the first $250,000 -- or more!</p>

<h3>A BOOK by ME Holocaust Series</h3>
<p>Over 70 books have now been written and illustrated by children for children in this series.  The vision started when Deb Bowen met three Jewish survivors in her area named Esther.  Esther Avruch, Esther Katz and Esther Schiff became dear friends and Bowen could not let their stories die with them.  She asked young people to meet them, hear their stories and then write and illustrate a children's book about their lives.  The writing project has grown by word of mouth.  Today there are stories about Jewish survivors, World War II veterans who were eyewitnesses to the concentration camps and Righteous Gentiles (non-Jews who risked their lives to help a Jewish person).</p>

Over 70 books have now been written and illustrated by children for children in this series.  The vision started when Deb Bowen met three Jewish survivors in her area named Esther.  Esther Avruch, Esther Katz and Esther Schiff became dear friends and Bowen could not let their stories die with them.  She asked young people to meet them, hear their stories and then write and illustrate a children's book about their lives.  The writing project has grown by word of mouth.  Today there are stories about Jewish survivors, World War II veterans who were eyewitnesses to the concentration camps and Righteous Gentiles (non-Jews who risked their lives to help a Jewish person).
 

""I started to read the materials and stories, and I could not put them down.   It was so powerful to read both the student's interpretation, as well as the direct stories from the survivors themselves.  I have many times researched and studied the Holocaust, but these stories bring the experience to life.""

Granddaughter to President Dwight D. Eisenhower     
 
 
 


 
“Each book in the series is a gem! The individual and personal participation and investment of the youthful authors and illustrators is quite outstanding. May you have continued success in your Holy Work.”

<p>Hiya Everyone, 
</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by, Paul is my name and I am relatively new to this. As an ordinary guy setting off on an adventure in 2006 I found myself teaching English to a group of kids in a local Childrens home in Kathmandu. This small incident has completely changed my outlook on life and I hope together we can ensure this home can continue to provide holistic care for these happy and healthy kids. 
</p>
<p>Mitrata Nepal was founded in 2000 to provide food, shelter and education to a small number of children. Since opening, the number of children being cared for has increased and it is currently caring for 22 children who live in the home and 9 educational scholarships for lucky families who would otherwise not be able to afford any schooling. 
</p>
<p>With Christmas approaching in the western world we will be putting some presents under our trees, for this home we need help putting food on their plates. We need your help to meet the daily running costs of this home: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>2 USD will feed 1 child for a day.</li>
<li>20 USD will pay a childs school fees for a month.</li>
<li>100 USD will provide holistic care for 1 child for a month.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">OR</p>
<ul><li>1000 USD will cover all staff salaries for 4 months</li></ul>
<p>In aid of this event I will be running my first ever marathon, the 42 km course around my home city, Lucerne, Switzerland will be a challenge for even the most prepared athletes, I am aim to do it with only 4 weeks training (due to an unexpected turn of life events) and under 4 hours, if I cannot achieve my goal I will donate the contents of my personal bank account (2000 pounds) to the cause.</p>
<p>I hope you can see how important this organisation is to me and how necesary it is to ensure these kids are continued to be cared for. I hope you are able to spare some time, energy and money for these children.</p>
<p>All donations of 15 pound or more will receive a thank you card and photo from the children at Mitrata Nepal for your christmas tree. These children are to be the future for this country facing hardship, please help us give them the brightest possible outlook.</p>
<p>Many thanks, </p>

Back To East Utica 



Bigger Than Kong, Cooler Than Austin Powers!

 ...absolutely no place like it on the planet!
""We opened the Original Mojo's in 2005 as a family venture. My life partner, my wife Terry, worked side by side with our son Cameron, myself and our crew, both day and night. Her drive, her personality, and her cooking and baking skills made Mojo's a place that people enjoyed coming to. Our family left Mojo's as Terry became ill. Though the business continued with new owners, many have told us it just wasn't the same. Terry ultimately lost a hard fought battle with breast cancer, and left this world in 2013.

In Loving Memory Of Terry Lynn Alati

1959 to 2013
After a five year battle we lost our
'Peaceful Warrior' on February 11, 2013




Here with Prejean, her 25 year old Blue Front Amazon Parrot


Now, after her passing, I seek, with the help of our extended family, to pour my heart and soul into this venture as a tribute to Terry. It is what she would have wanted.

Are You Missing Your Mojo? 
 Young and Old - EVERYONE IS. 
Remember, We Always Said, 

It's your place...not ours!



Mojo's is something special. It is like a library or a public park. It is like a temple for your mind. It is a place we can all go to relax, think, learn and to share our knowledge with others. 

If everyone reading this donated, our fundraiser would be done in no time. 


Our Indiegogo campaign has just over two weeks left. Now is definitely the time to consider making a donation of $5, $20, $50 or whatever you can to help launch Mojo's. Don't forget, you are being rewarded with perks. This basically means that you are investing in this project and your investment will be paying off within ninety days. It is a sound investment...don't you think? 


Here is our promise to everyone that helps out and gets us close to our goal. 


We will refund every penny, to each and every donor, if we are not able to open
 Mojo's in December 2013 for any reason whatsoever. PERIOD! So let's just get it done. It is truly a win win project for everyone in our community.



Do you have a favorite café now? 
I mean really, can we hang out comfortably at the newly remodeled corporate big chain hamburger joints? Or at franchised mediocre donut places? 

We only have a few small independently run local cafés left. Each and every one is so uniquely wonderful! Please help out!


Located in the Parkway Drugs and Family Dollar Plaza.
IT'S MOJO'S.  Lip smackin', palette pleasin', beverages and food, served up to you by as many of the original Mojo's gang that we can muster up. And when we couple this with our signature 'insanely wonderful' customer service, we all can smile and look back on what is a remarkably incredible life journey. IT'S ALL ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY.

THE SPACE IS AVAILABLE, MUCH OF THE EQUIPMENT IS ALL IN PLACE, AND JOE, CAMERON, AND MARIA ARE READY 'TO GIT R' DONE'! 

wE  tHinK  wE  nEEd  MoJOs  bAcK,  dOn'T  yOu?

Raise Your Hand If You Want Mojo's Back! 




""WITH YOUR GENEROUS ASSISTANCE, WE CAN MAKE MOJO'S, ONCE AGAIN, ONE OF THE BEST COFFEEHOUSE/CAFE, HANDS DOWN!""


WHAT WAS YOUR MOST FAVORITE THING ABOUT MOJO'S? 


Was it the food?
Perhaps the unbelievable beverages?
Maybe great customer service.
How about being able to enjoy friends & family without the mess at home?
Or could it have been a favorite employee that brought you in?


It Is All About The Community

Whatever your reason(s) for wanting us back, we hope you will support us here and come in frequently to enjoy - MOJO's CAFE...Because it is, YOUR CAFE.


WE HAVE SOME NEW TREATS IN STORE FOR YOU TOO! But we are keeping them top secret and you will just have to wait to find out what they are. 


The Impact On East Utica 
MOJO's can rise again and be your excellent eclectic café with a full range of foods and a drive through window.  As owners (and workers) we are really friendly people who know how to make not only good coffee, but good food, pastries and friends too!  
We are proud to boast, that our free wireless signal was always up and running for you, with a strong signal and 99.9% uptime.

Our espresso is good enough for a snob who has been living in Washington for maybe too long and the atmosphere is great. Be sure to come in on certain nights of the week and be treated to open mic night or even a live band or two.
Signature espresso drinks prepared by our skilled baristas, delicious! 



Amazing Espresso! 

A Handcrafted Capuccino!


What We Need 
The Mojo's project needs approximately thirty thousand dollars ($27,000.00) to come to fruition. We need your donations now to raise at least $12,000.00 in this 30 day campaign. In addition to our Indiegogo Campaign, we have raised additional outside funding, secured via savings and a private loan.
Right Now We Need Your Support.

This is the approximate breakdown of how funds will be utilized.


$2400 to put the existing equipment into working order. 
$7200 to purchase new equipment.

$1300 for cleanup, repair and additions.
$4100 for new chairs and table alterations.
$1600 for interior and exterior signage.
$4000 for required permits and deposits.
$3600 for initial stock of product.
$2800 +/- advertising and operating costs.

Be assured, if we don't reach our entire goal, we still plan on forging ahead, but we will have to proceed on a smaller scale. 

We interrupt your regularly scheduled program for a word from Maria

Hey listen, we are not into the video shooting commercial stuff. So you got a few blooper style video flops, ala Maria. Think you can do better? Make your own video. LOL! 

Please Help Us Get The Word Out
SPREAD THE WORD! Please folks, you have to blast this AROUND if we are going to get the word out. So make some noise about Mojo's. Use Facebook, Twitter, Email, Text, Phone Call, or send a carrier pidgeon, for 'crying out load.' Just do whatever it takes! 
Only you can bring back the Magic Mojo!
And speaking of Mojo, and most of all...we need Maria back! In order to get her back full time and keep her exclusively @ Mojo's, she needs for us to supply her with health insurance benefits. By giving Maria a good salary and health insurance, (combined with her exceptional tip earning abilities) we will be giving her a solid foundation to build on for a very happy future.

<p><b>From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for supporting NEXT UP!!!</b></p>
</div>
</div></div>","Next Up Foundation is a unique non-profit organization that provides FREE after-school skateboarding mentoring programs in underserved areas. Our mission is to help underserved youth of diverse backgrounds overcome their unique challenges in order to become successful and flourish, by supporting their development and education and promoting a healthy lifestyle.
We're ready to expand! In just five years of operation we've served over 12,000 kids. Our goal is to serve 6,000 kids in 2016 alone, BUT we need your help! We are raising funds to sustain and expand our programs in order to mentor more youth and more greatly impact the community.

About Us

Next Up Foundation's founder, Vinicius ""Vina"" Tinoco, moved from his home in Brazil to California, armed with a vision of using skateboarding as a gateway to help young people solve their problems and create better lives. Next Up's board of directors and board members include individuals who are passionate about serving community and assisting youth, including Andre Genovesi, Josh Friedberg, Neal Hendrix, Matt Piercey, Richard Faris, Dana-Beth Faris, Joseph Madrid, Mike Arrache, Lisa Timmons, Kevin Webber and Austin Black.
We teach our kids life-lessons inherent to successful development through our CHANGE MENTORING PROGRAM (Community, Health, Action, Nurture, Goals, and Experience).

We currently work in Anaheim and Long Beach. In Anaheim we work with the City of Anaheim, and in Long Beach we collaborate with the Boys & Girls Club. We also have worked with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Santa Ana and Anaheim, providing this service mainly on volunteer hours.
We've done over 400 sessions of our programs, put in nearly 5,000 hours of volunteer work, and served over 12,000 kids in the cities of Anaheim, Santa Ana, and Long Beach.




What We Need & What You Get
Overall, we hope to raise $10,000 to operate for 12 months. Here's how your contributions will help:



OUR KIDS: Purchasing safety equipment and skateboards, providing uniforms (shirts and hats and in some instances shoes), paying for educational field trips to companies and skate parks, printing our leadership CHANGE notebooks, and purchasing a comprehensive liability insurance.

OUR FOUNDATION: All funding we receive establishes financial history and helps to build budget management experience, consequently making application for grants easier. Our future goals include turning our passionate team of volunteers into sustainable and expandable business, hiring a full-time program coordinator, and training new mentors.

Why needed now? 


We are planning to rebuild our program in Santa Ana, extend our program in Anaheim to mentoring twice a week, maintain our program in Long Beach, and start an entirely new program in Los Angeles. We have been 
approached about expanding our programs to Jupiter, FL; Fallbrook, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Federal District, Mexico; Brownsville,TX; Spokane, WA; Fort Collins, CO; San Fernando Valley, CA; Stanton, CA; San Bernardino, CA; and many more. The sky is the limit!  We want to bring Next Up Foundation to as many cities as possible, where deserving youth can access adult mentors who will inspire them to persevere and overcome adversity, recognize and stay away from bad influences, study and stay in school, and take care of their bodies.
We have run these programs 
solely through volunteer work,
donations, and through the sacrifice of Vina, our founder. Without your support, we will not be able to grow and help more kids who need mentorship.   
Next Up Foundation has the approval and support of many important figures in our community who have seen the difference Next Up makes in the lives of kids who participate. Many have helped provide perks for our donors, among them some experiences that might happen just once in a life-time. Check them out!!







The Impact
“An after school program is an extremely powerful anti-crime weapon.” -Chief William Bratton, Los Angeles Police Department



12- to 17-year old kids left unsupervised three or more days per week are twice as likely  as other kids to hang out with gang members, three times as likely  to be engaged in criminal behavior, and three times as likely  to smoke marijuana. (Opinion Research Corporation, 2006.  FIGHT CRIME: INVEST IN KIDS California, California Survey of Teens.)

In 2014, nearly 1,200,000 of California’s children would participate in an after school program if one were available. (After School Alliance)



The predominant challenges parents face enrolling their child in an after school program include: preference for alternative activities and overly expensive after school programs (average of $126 weekly). (After School Alliance)

</p><p><b>Syrian Refugees</b></p>
<p>More than 4 million Syrians have fled their country because of war. Most of them come to Turkey. As of April 2015, Turkey has become the world's biggest refugee hosting country with 2.1 million Syrian refugees and had spent more than US$6 billion on direct assistance to refugees. Around 30 percent of them live in 22 government-run camps near the Syrian-Turkish border. Yet, the rest struggle to settle a life for their families in big cities. </p>
<p><b>Refugees Istanbul</b></p>
<p>While Europe struggles over 224,000 refugees, the number of displaced Syrians has reached 330,000 in Istanbul. They come here with a hope to find a work and a home. Everyday you can see more than one Syrian family begging for food at every corner, on every street . In Istanbul alone, 3,000 of them live by begging. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444824189/fjczifotvtafg6kxel9h.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p><b>How They Live?</b></p>
<p>Most of the families live in abandoned buildings in suburbs of Istanbul. Let aside heating, some houses don't even have doors or windows! Harsh winter conditions make it harder to survive especially for kids.

<p><b>Every Little Helps</b></p>
<p>What we would like to do is simply, to buy at least 200 blankets and donate them to the Syrian families in Istanbul before the winter comes.

This is kind of a surprise for her :) She will see this as soon as the first donation is made.</p><p>Thank you Eda for such a meaningful initiation and Happy Birthday again.</p><p><b>Sources for Data</b></p>

More than 4 million Syrians have fled their country because of war. Most of them come to Turkey. As of April 2015, Turkey has become the world's biggest refugee hosting country with 2.1 million Syrian refugees and had spent more than US$6 billion on direct assistance to refugees. Around 30 percent of them live in 22 government-run camps near the Syrian-Turkish border. Yet, the rest struggle to settle a life for their families in big cities.

<p>This year the TCA
Convention will have world class instructors and great shows. but a big change this year is we are bringing joy to kids fighting cancer:</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><ul>
<li>Kids will be the focus. This year the big show will host children fighting cancer together with their families. The convention is not just for clowns, it is for the kids.</li>
<li>Every penny raised here will go to providing joy to the kids.</li>
<li>The All-Star Show is expanded to make it a once-in-a-lifetime event in a real circus tent.</li>
<li>The Rosy Nose Clown Alley in Tyler, Texas is a new
     clown alley and we volunteered to host this year’s convention.</li>
<li>Each teacher could be a headliner at any other
     convention. We are bringing the best teachers to this convention</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Because this is an ambitious and
     expensive convention, we need your help. It will be the best you have ever seen having an
     impact far beyond the members of the Texas Clown Association.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that you, our
colleges and friends, are caring and generous. We need your help to fund this
event and trust we can accomplish great things together.</p>
<p></p><h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p></p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The convention will cost over $20,000 total. Less than
     half of that is covered by registration fees.</li>
<li>The added expense this year is from two area.</li>
<ul>
<li>We are bringing in teachers and performers who are the
      best in their fields. We did not just ask, “Who can we get?” Instead, we
      asked who would be the BEST in each area.</li>
<li>With this much talent, we decided to share the talent with
      kids fighting cancer. We will have an All-Star show in a circus tent. We
      will make a once-in-a-lifetime memory for families who deserve to smile
      and forget their struggles for a little while.</li>
</ul>
<li>We have some fun and interesting perks for
     contributors. There will be special things to see and do at the
     convention. There are fun perks even if you cannot attend the TCA
     Convention or show. We want to make sure that you know how thankful we are
     for your loving support!</li>
<li>Every penny of this campaign will go directly to
     providing the entertainment for the kids. The clown training and the rest
     of the convention will be funded through other means. Everything we raise
     here will go directly to bringing joy to kids with cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><h2>The Impact</h2><p></p>
<p>The impact of your
giving will be felt in the community, in the Texas Clown Association, and most
importantly by the kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are a TCA member, you will be helping to make
     this the most memorable convention ever.</li>
<li>If you are a member of the Tyler community, you will be
     impacting kids right here in our community.</li>
<li>The Texas Clown Association has a rich history of
     giving and caring. This organization makes a difference in Texas.</li>
<li>The Rosy Nose Clown Alley is a 501c3 Non-profit
     organization. An accounting firm is overseeing all of our fundraising
     activities. All of the money raised here goes to help the kids. Not a
     penny will go to overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p></p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p></p>
<p>Being less than three years old, the Rosy Nose Clown Alley took a couple of big risks.</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">First we took
the risk of hosting the TCA convention. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Second we took the risk of expanding
the scope of the convention to help children.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>All the money raised in this campaign will go directly to providing for the kids. The convention itself
will be funded by registration fees and other fund-raising by members of the
Rosy Nose Clown Alley. </p>
<p>But we had to commit
early to set the things in motion to provide entertainment for the children.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are working with Trinity Mother Frances Hospital,
     Lil’ Wranglers (a part of the Cattle Barons Gala organization), and the
     American Cancer Society to identify kids and families who will benefit the
     most from this event.</li>
<li>We had to contact the families and organizations early
     to set things in motion.</li>
<li>Deposits and rental fees that are coming due for facilities

</div></div>","Texas Clown Association 2015
This year the TCA
Convention will have world class instructors and great shows. but a big change this year is we are bringing joy to kids fighting cancer:
Kids will be the focus. This year the big show will host children fighting cancer together with their families. The convention is not just for clowns, it is for the kids.
Every penny raised here will go to providing joy to the kids.
The All-Star Show is expanded to make it a once-in-a-lifetime event in a real circus tent.
The Rosy Nose Clown Alley in Tyler, Texas is a new
     clown alley and we volunteered to host this year’s convention.
Each teacher could be a headliner at any other
     convention. We are bringing the best teachers to this convention

Because this is an ambitious and
     expensive convention, we need your help. It will be the best you have ever seen having an
     impact far beyond the members of the Texas Clown Association.


We know that you, our
colleges and friends, are caring and generous. We need your help to fund this
event and trust we can accomplish great things together.
What We Need & What You Get
Here are the details:

The convention will cost over $20,000 total. Less than
     half of that is covered by registration fees.
The added expense this year is from two area.

We are bringing in teachers and performers who are the
      best in their fields. We did not just ask, “Who can we get?” Instead, we
      asked who would be the BEST in each area.
With this much talent, we decided to share the talent with
      kids fighting cancer. We will have an All-Star show in a circus tent. We
      will make a once-in-a-lifetime memory for families who deserve to smile
      and forget their struggles for a little while.

We have some fun and interesting perks for
     contributors. There will be special things to see and do at the
     convention. There are fun perks even if you cannot attend the TCA
     Convention or show. We want to make sure that you know how thankful we are
     for your loving support!
Every penny of this campaign will go directly to
     providing the entertainment for the kids. The clown training and the rest
     of the convention will be funded through other means. Everything we raise
     here will go directly to bringing joy to kids with cancer.

The Impact
The impact of your
giving will be felt in the community, in the Texas Clown Association, and most
importantly by the kids:

If you are a TCA member, you will be helping to make
     this the most memorable convention ever.
If you are a member of the Tyler community, you will be
     impacting kids right here in our community.
The Texas Clown Association has a rich history of
     giving and caring. This organization makes a difference in Texas.
The Rosy Nose Clown Alley is a 501c3 Non-profit
     organization. An accounting firm is overseeing all of our fundraising
     activities. All of the money raised here goes to help the kids. Not a
     penny will go to overhead.

Risks & Challenges
Being less than three years old, the Rosy Nose Clown Alley took a couple of big risks.

First we took
the risk of hosting the TCA convention. 


Second we took the risk of expanding
the scope of the convention to help children.


All the money raised in this campaign will go directly to providing for the kids. The convention itself
will be funded by registration fees and other fund-raising by members of the
Rosy Nose Clown Alley. 
But we had to commit
early to set the things in motion to provide entertainment for the children.

We are working with Trinity Mother Frances Hospital,
     Lil’ Wranglers (a part of the Cattle Barons Gala organization), and the
     American Cancer Society to identify kids and families who will benefit the
     most from this event.
We had to contact the families and organizations early
     to set things in motion.
Deposits and rental fees that are coming due for facilities
     and equipment are being paid out of pocket by alley members.
We are trusting YOU, our community, to make this happen.

Other Ways You Can Help
No matter what your
level of giving is we need additional help:

Get the word out and make some noise about this
     campaign. Facebook stories, blog posts, newsletter articles, mentions at
     meetings, can all help us.
This website has tools to help you spread the word!

Together we will
impact kids and bring joy...why not?

<h3><em>High Country</em></h3>
<p>The mountains of Colorado are home to hundreds of shepherds, who come from Latin America on contracts and lead solitary lives in tents or trailers as they tend to sheep. Steve and Mary Kreis, who serve on mission with InFaith, recognized an opportunity to ease the shepherds' loneliness and introduce them to the love of Jesus. Steve began to visit shepherds regularly, offering them friendship and opportunities to study the Bible and learn more of God's love for them. Steve and Mary also bring the shepherds tangible gifts, such as books, Bibles, and phone cards to call their families in Latin America.</p>
<p>In August 2013, a film crew from InFaith Pictures traveled with Steve to visit some of the shepherds. The resulting documentary, <em>High Country</em>, gives a glimpse of these shepherds' lives and tells the story of how Jesus is at work in their lives. In conjunction with the November 2013 release of the film, InFaith Pictures is giving viewers the opportunity to become directly involved in the ministry of Steve and Mary Kreis through this indiegogo campaign. </p>
<p>Steve's truck is vital to his ministry; he travels many miles over treacherous roads to meet the shepherds in the remote locations where they work. Over the years, his truck has taken a beating. To continue in service, it needs new tires and a suspension upgrade. We want to raise funds to repair Steve's truck so that it can travel the high country for many years to come. Steve is one of the few people who take the time and effort to visit these men where they camp; if he were unable to get to them, he would be missed.</p>
<p>InFaith Pictures, InFaith's nonprofit film production company, uses documentary films to tell the story of Jesus. It is the first fruit of InFaith's new campaign to draw Christ-followers with creative skills into vocational Christian service through a ministry residency that helps people with dreams turn their seed ideas into fruitful ministry. InFaith has been finding new ways to introduce people in the United States to Jesus since 1790; InFaith Pictures is the most recent outgrowth of InFaith's mission to tell the story of Jesus in a way that contemporary listeners can understand.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Steve and Mary Kreis have received a quote for $800 for a suspension upgrade and $815 for new tires. We would like to raise enough money to pay for these repairs and related expenses, which include fundraising costs and funds for administrative services that InFaith provides for everyone who serves with them.<br/><br/>The Kreises raise funds for living and ministry expenses through InFaith, which is a 501(c)(3) organization, so your donation to this campaign is tax deductible.

The mountains of Colorado are home to hundreds of shepherds, who come from Latin America on contracts and lead solitary lives in tents or trailers as they tend to sheep. Steve and Mary Kreis, who serve on mission with InFaith, recognized an opportunity to ease the shepherds' loneliness and introduce them to the love of Jesus. Steve began to visit shepherds regularly, offering them friendship and opportunities to study the Bible and learn more of God's love for them. Steve and Mary also bring the shepherds tangible gifts, such as books, Bibles, and phone cards to call their families in Latin America.
In August 2013, a film crew from InFaith Pictures traveled with Steve to visit some of the shepherds. The resulting documentary, High Country, gives a glimpse of these shepherds' lives and tells the story of how Jesus is at work in their lives. In conjunction with the November 2013 release of the film, InFaith Pictures is giving viewers the opportunity to become directly involved in the ministry of Steve and Mary Kreis through this indiegogo campaign. 
Steve's truck is vital to his ministry; he travels many miles over treacherous roads to meet the shepherds in the remote locations where they work. Over the years, his truck has taken a beating. To continue in service, it needs new tires and a suspension upgrade. We want to raise funds to repair Steve's truck so that it can travel the high country for many years to come. Steve is one of the few people who take the time and effort to visit these men where they camp; if he were unable to get to them, he would be missed.
InFaith Pictures, InFaith's nonprofit film production company, uses documentary films to tell the story of Jesus. It is the first fruit of InFaith's new campaign to draw Christ-followers with creative skills into vocational Christian service through a ministry residency that helps people with dreams turn their seed ideas into fruitful ministry. InFaith has been finding new ways to introduce people in the United States to Jesus since 1790; InFaith Pictures is the most recent outgrowth of InFaith's mission to tell the story of Jesus in a way that contemporary listeners can understand.
 

What We Need 
Steve and Mary Kreis have received a quote for $800 for a suspension upgrade and $815 for new tires. We would like to raise enough money to pay for these repairs and related expenses, which include fundraising costs and funds for administrative services that InFaith provides for everyone who serves with them.The Kreises raise funds for living and ministry expenses through InFaith, which is a 501(c)(3) organization, so your donation to this campaign is tax deductible. Any funds raised above the goal will go toward Steve and Mary's general ministry expenses, which includes fuel and ongoing vehicle maintenance.

<p>L'uomo è il solo essere vivente che indossa indumenti: un'altra delle caratteristiche uniche della nostra specie. È qualcosa che fa pensare….</p>
<p>L’idea da cui siamo partiti e che ognuno di noi, nella nostra esteriorità, trasmette dei messaggi, tante piccole informazioni che danno agli altri un’idea di chi siamo e da dove proveniamo. Ci siamo accorti, che circolano per lo più messaggi negativi o poco significativi.</p>
<p>Allora ci siamo chiesti, perché non colmare questo vuoto comunicativo per farci portatori di un messaggio positivo, intelligente e che ci aiuti a ricordarci chi siamo veramente?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Il Brand: <b>“Don't Forget Who We Are”</b> nasce proprio da qui.<br/></p>

<br/><p>Un’immagine può trasmettere un’emozione, magari fugace, ma può anche lasciare il segno se si trasforma in uno stimolo per saperne di più.</p>
<p>È per questo motivo che sul collo abbiamo aggiunto, oltre al titolo e alla data dell’evento, un <b>QR Code</b> che grazie a qualunque dispositivo collegato in rete, ci proietta all'interno di una storia che aiuta a comprendere l'essenza di quell'evento.</p>
<p>And there's more: an image and a slogan can convey an emotion, maybe a fleeting one, but they can also leave a mark if they become the stimulus to search for more information. </p>

Then why not use this gap of communication to convey a positive and intelligent message, one that can help us remember who we really are?
""Don't forget who we are"" is born precisely from this concept.



So, we have decided to tell the history of man on ""pages of cloth"" by recalling his most significant events, from tragic mistakes to stunning achievements: the steps taken by our species on the road that led us to become what we are today.Lest we forget.Not only a new line of t-shirts, but a project that aims not only to meet the aesthetic tastes of consumers, but to draw their attention towards a content of a strong social significance.On the front of our t-shirts, which have been entirely produced in Italy, there will be an image of an event or a character that, for better or worse, with honour or horror, has left an indelible mark on history.And there's more: an image and a slogan can convey an emotion, maybe a fleeting one, but they can also leave a mark if they become the stimulus to search for more information. That's why we have printed on the neck a QR Code that through any device connected to the Internet, such as a smartphone, propels us straight to the details of that story.And then under the image, on the left, we printed the Brand and our exhortation to remember : ""Don't Forget Who We Are"", let's not forget who we are and where we come from.The subjectsThe first stories that we decided to tell are 4 stories that we must not forget, because their protagonists have left a very strong message.

On this site you will be able to fund our idea, to get the numbered and limited edition t-shirt, to be our ""ambassadors"" and to suggest new stories to tell.To choose the sizes, the characters and models you can write on info@dontforgetwwa.com

(Versione in Italiano)


Ognuno di noi nella nostra esteriorità trasmette messaggi; perché non veicolarne uno intelligente?




L'uomo è il solo essere vivente che indossa indumenti: un'altra delle caratteristiche uniche della nostra specie. È qualcosa che fa pensare….
L’idea da cui siamo partiti e che ognuno di noi, nella nostra esteriorità, trasmette dei messaggi, tante piccole informazioni che danno agli altri un’idea di chi siamo e da dove proveniamo. Ci siamo accorti, che circolano per lo più messaggi negativi o poco significativi.
Allora ci siamo chiesti, perché non colmare questo vuoto comunicativo per farci portatori di un messaggio positivo, intelligente e che ci aiuti a ricordarci chi siamo veramente?

Il Brand: “Don't Forget Who We Are” nasce proprio da qui.
Così, abbiamo deciso di raccontare la storia dell’uomo su “pagine di stoffa”, richiamandone gli eventi più significativi, dai tragici errori alle meravigliose conquiste: i passi percorsi dalla nostra specie sulla strada che ci ha portato a diventare ciò che siamo oggi.
Per non dimenticare.Non solo una nuova linea di t-shirt, ma un progetto che ha lo scopo di andare incontro ai gusti estetici dei consumatori, e soprattutto di attirare l’attenzione di questi, verso contenuti ricchi di un forte significato.


Un’immagine può trasmettere un’emozione, magari fugace, ma può anche lasciare il segno se si trasforma in uno stimolo per saperne di più.
È per questo motivo che sul collo abbiamo aggiunto, oltre al titolo e alla data dell’evento, un QR Code che grazie a qualunque dispositivo collegato in rete, ci proietta all'interno di una storia che aiuta a comprendere l'essenza di quell'evento.
And there's more: an image and a slogan can convey an emotion, maybe a fleeting one, but they can also leave a mark if they become the stimulus to search for more information. 
That's why we have printed on the neck a QR Code that through any device connected to the Internet, such as a smartphone, propels us straight to the details of that story.


Sotto l'immagine, sulla sinistra, abbiamo riportato, il Marchio e la nostra esortazione a ricordare: “Don’t Forget Who We Are”, non dimentichiamo chi siamo e da dove veniamo.
And then under the image, on the left, we printed the Brand and our exhortation to remember : ""Don't Forget Who We Are"", let's not forget who we are and where we come from.

<p>Hey angels. My name is Shannon O'Bryan and I am gearing up for a new adventure that will not only be life-changing for me, but is sure to create a ripple effect that will make an enormous impact in the world. I am launching this campaign in the hopes of raising money to help me to travel to India to volunteer for a company that has been doing some incredible work called ASTEP (Artists Striving To End Poverty). Once in India, working with the ASTEP team, I will work with a large group of children living in poverty in Pune and help them find their voices through the arts (dance, singing, acting, music, painting, creative writing, etc.) and teach them how to pay this service forward in their community. Without the help of ASTEP and Teach for India, these children may not have the opportunity to receive any education. Through our programs, these children are supported with schooling through high school and are prepared to move forward with their education or to head out into the work force creating tremendous positive change for them and their families. We do several community outreach projects while there, working to provide happiness, better health and an overall sense of peace for those living in an extremely challenged state. Our hope is to remove the underlying fear that exists in these poverty stricken areas, eventually bringing peace one town at a time around the world. </p>
<p>Once my time in India is completed and I return to the States, I fully intend to continue this work and to support this wonderful organization here in the U.S. and in other countries all over the world.

Be Love. Be Light. Be.

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b><h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Most attacks begin with a conversation. </h4>
<h4>Not all conversations lead to an attack.</h4>
<h4>How do you know when a conversation is going to go bad?</h4>
<br/></b></h1><h1><b>My Story</b></h1><p>My name is Michelle Gay. I am a 5th degree black belt, 5-time women’s full
contact fighting champion, a Laban Certified Movement Analyst and martial arts instructor at Ken Wa Kan Karate in NYC. A close friend was raped by a man she met at a hockey rink, he offered to drive
her home – she was fifteen. Her life was altered forever. Mine too, although, I
didn’t realize it at the time.</p>
<p>1 in 4 woman and 1 in 7 men with be sexually assaulted in their lifetime, and many before they reach the age of 20.  As a trained advocate for the St. Vincent Rape Crisis Program
from 1996 – 2002, I discovered that most sexual assault begins with some form
of ""getting to know you"" - an offer to help in some way, a request for assistance
from you, or an offer to do something for you, like buy you a drink or dinner. </p>
<p>In 2003, combining martial arts, movement analysis and verbal communication techniques, I developed the Safe and Sound
Seminar.  I have taught it at Barnard College, Baruch College, Lehman College, Dalton High School and for the last 8 years as part of Broadway Dance Center’s International Foreign Student Visa Program.  I continue to offer it frequently at The Society for Martial Arts Instruction in NYC, but I want to make this life-saving education available to a large number of people. </p><p><b>It's time to make it available globally by putting it online as a web tutorial!  </b>Easily digestible segments that can be downloaded on your computer or phone and
played on the way to a party, before you travel or on your way to a date.  Ultimately our goal is to have you and your loved ones making
informed and empowered decisions so they can be safe and sound wherever they are.</p>
<p>You can make this project a reality by
contributing money and joining our Safe and Sound community of street smart warriors.    No matter what your level of participation, we welcome you to take action, especially if you think this seminar would be valuable to your friends, family and communities.  The fact that you read all the way to the end of this, speaks volumes to the commitment that
you are to people being safe and sound.</p><p>In service and gratitude, </p><p>Michelle Gay and the SASS Team</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/785195/files/20140813074926-Michelle_Gay_karate_shot.png?1407941366"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><br/></p><h1>About The Seminar</h1><p></p><div>The seminar begins with a scenario of a man picking up a woman at a party.  We break down the conversation that leads up to an attack and teach people the cues to look for when someone is trying to dominate you.  </div><div><br/></div><div>We then do movement exercises to look at some of the body language and non-verbal elements of domination.  You learn techniques for being smart on the street and gain awareness about your own behavior.  Attackers are often working hard to get you off balance by speeding you up, slowing you down or confusing you.  We teach you how to be powerful in your space and understand your own strengths and weaknesses. </div><div><br/></div><div>We end the seminar with a little butt kicking, so that participants walk away with some easy physical self defense to back up the word ""No.""  Release and run techniques, where to hit sensitive areas on the body and tips for getting away will give you the tools you need if things get hairy.<br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>For a more in-depth look at the course, you can watch this video:<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FlZEerT_r_CA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlZEerT_r_CA&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FlZEerT_r_CA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div>
</div><div><br/></div><p></p><h1>Standing up to an Epidemic of Violence with Education</h1><div>Assault continues to be a huge problem, especially on college campuses.  In a recent article from Rolling Stone entitled <b>""<a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/confronting-campus-rape-20140604"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Confronting Campus Rape</a>"" </b>President Obama said, ""Now it's up to each of us – every single one of us – to keep up this momentum. We've got to keep working with educators and police officers to search for new ways to prevent these crimes. We are going to keep pushing for people to step up across my administration, in state capitals and on college campuses across the country. And perhaps most importantly, we need to keep saying to anyone out there who has ever been assaulted: You are not alone. We have your back.""<br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p>Many leaders talk about ""preventing violence"" but don't provide enough security or education to support communities in being safe.  Ultimately we must be responsible for our safety and the safety of those around us.  Don't let your friend go off with with a stranger, get to know the person you are about to let into your building and ultimately, trust your gut.</p>
<p>We see the Safe and Sound Seminar as a powerful tool that has you spot a potential predator or bully, disarm them with your words and get you to safety.  Not every good samaritan is a criminal and not every charming guy is Prince Charming.  We can help you tell the difference.</p>

</div><h1>Our Goals</h1>We hope to make this online tutorial available to schools, colleges, businesses and organizations across the country.  We think this seminar is especially valuable to young people who are moving away from home for the fist time and may be moving to a city where assault and theft are more common.  We would like to see this course offered as part of every orientation packet in colleges across the globe.<div>
<br/><div>The funds we raise will be used to film my lecture and a scenario we will film with a professional team of filmmakers led by Producer/Director Laura Newman.  Zelda is co-writer and fight choreographer for the scene.  Funds will also go toward creating a website and marketing materials so we can reach the widest amount of people possible.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Once we have made parts 1-3 we plan to sell them online and to organizations, building up enough funds to create parts 4-10.  We plan to film more scenarios that appeal to a diverse range of people; men who may be concerned with bullying or mugging, LGBT people, children, etc.  Ultimately we want the course to be accessible and valuable to anyone.<br/><p><br/></p>

<div>“Michelle Gay taught a Safe And Sound Seminar to my dance students at Lehman College. The next class they were bubbling over with excitement and couldn’t stop talking about it. They were amazed by how clear and specific and simple the information was. They kept talking about the videos and the movements they’d worked on together. Every student, male and female, seemed to have gotten something from the class that they would take out into their lives immediately. They also loved Michelle as a person; they were quite inspired by her combination of strength and tenderness and left wanting more!” <strong>- <strong>Aynsley Vandenbroucke-Adjunct Professor</strong></strong>

</div></div>","Most attacks begin with a conversation. 
Not all conversations lead to an attack.
How do you know when a conversation is going to go bad?
My StoryMy name is Michelle Gay. I am a 5th degree black belt, 5-time women’s full
contact fighting champion, a Laban Certified Movement Analyst and martial arts instructor at Ken Wa Kan Karate in NYC. A close friend was raped by a man she met at a hockey rink, he offered to drive
her home – she was fifteen. Her life was altered forever. Mine too, although, I
didn’t realize it at the time.
1 in 4 woman and 1 in 7 men with be sexually assaulted in their lifetime, and many before they reach the age of 20.  As a trained advocate for the St. Vincent Rape Crisis Program
from 1996 – 2002, I discovered that most sexual assault begins with some form
of ""getting to know you"" - an offer to help in some way, a request for assistance
from you, or an offer to do something for you, like buy you a drink or dinner. 
In 2003, combining martial arts, movement analysis and verbal communication techniques, I developed the Safe and Sound
Seminar.  I have taught it at Barnard College, Baruch College, Lehman College, Dalton High School and for the last 8 years as part of Broadway Dance Center’s International Foreign Student Visa Program.  I continue to offer it frequently at The Society for Martial Arts Instruction in NYC, but I want to make this life-saving education available to a large number of people. It's time to make it available globally by putting it online as a web tutorial!  Easily digestible segments that can be downloaded on your computer or phone and
played on the way to a party, before you travel or on your way to a date.  Ultimately our goal is to have you and your loved ones making
informed and empowered decisions so they can be safe and sound wherever they are.
You can make this project a reality by
contributing money and joining our Safe and Sound community of street smart warriors.    No matter what your level of participation, we welcome you to take action, especially if you think this seminar would be valuable to your friends, family and communities.  The fact that you read all the way to the end of this, speaks volumes to the commitment that
you are to people being safe and sound.In service and gratitude, Michelle Gay and the SASS TeamAbout The SeminarThe seminar begins with a scenario of a man picking up a woman at a party.  We break down the conversation that leads up to an attack and teach people the cues to look for when someone is trying to dominate you.  We then do movement exercises to look at some of the body language and non-verbal elements of domination.  You learn techniques for being smart on the street and gain awareness about your own behavior.  Attackers are often working hard to get you off balance by speeding you up, slowing you down or confusing you.  We teach you how to be powerful in your space and understand your own strengths and weaknesses. We end the seminar with a little butt kicking, so that participants walk away with some easy physical self defense to back up the word ""No.""  Release and run techniques, where to hit sensitive areas on the body and tips for getting away will give you the tools you need if things get hairy.
For a more in-depth look at the course, you can watch this video:
Standing up to an Epidemic of Violence with EducationAssault continues to be a huge problem, especially on college campuses.  In a recent article from Rolling Stone entitled ""Confronting Campus Rape"" President Obama said, ""Now it's up to each of us – every single one of us – to keep up this momentum. We've got to keep working with educators and police officers to search for new ways to prevent these crimes. We are going to keep pushing for people to step up across my administration, in state capitals and on college campuses across the country. And perhaps most importantly, we need to keep saying to anyone out there who has ever been assaulted: You are not alone. We have your back.""

Many leaders talk about ""preventing violence"" but don't provide enough security or education to support communities in being safe.  Ultimately we must be responsible for our safety and the safety of those around us.  Don't let your friend go off with with a stranger, get to know the person you are about to let into your building and ultimately, trust your gut.
We see the Safe and Sound Seminar as a powerful tool that has you spot a potential predator or bully, disarm them with your words and get you to safety.  Not every good samaritan is a criminal and not every charming guy is Prince Charming.  We can help you tell the difference.






Our GoalsWe hope to make this online tutorial available to schools, colleges, businesses and organizations across the country.  We think this seminar is especially valuable to young people who are moving away from home for the fist time and may be moving to a city where assault and theft are more common.  We would like to see this course offered as part of every orientation packet in colleges across the globe.
The funds we raise will be used to film my lecture and a scenario we will film with a professional team of filmmakers led by Producer/Director Laura Newman.  Zelda is co-writer and fight choreographer for the scene.  Funds will also go toward creating a website and marketing materials so we can reach the widest amount of people possible.  

Once we have made parts 1-3 we plan to sell them online and to organizations, building up enough funds to create parts 4-10.  We plan to film more scenarios that appeal to a diverse range of people; men who may be concerned with bullying or mugging, LGBT people, children, etc.  Ultimately we want the course to be accessible and valuable to anyone.

We were founded in 2004 and our mission is to provide free or extremely low-cost education to the under-served communities on the edge of the city.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Focus on Education in Guatemala?</strong></h3>
<p>Due to a history of civil war, racism, and corruption, many children do not get the opportunity to even attend primary school. Many families do not see the value of investing in a child's education. Because of this, the literacy rate in Guatemala is only 55%. Even the families that can see value in educating their children are unable to assist their children in their studies being unable to read themselves. Partner this fact with the public school system that places up to 35 elementary school children in a class and up to 50 middle school aged children, and you can see why many children simply do not succeed. On top of that, it is a financial burden to send children to school after paying for uniforms and books (which can't be reused since children do their work directly in the textbooks). The poverty in some areas is so overwhelming that parents pull their children out of school quite early to work. Schools often fail to properly identify and cater to students with learning disabilities, which leads these children to drop out early because of a lack of options. Because of these factors, an estimated half of all children in Guatemala drop out of school before finishing their primary education in sixth grade.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a solution to families and people who want to study and can't afford it, and to emphasize the importance of education within the community.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Current Programs and School</strong></h3>
<p>Right now in El Nahual, we offer six programs on-site and one off-site. Several of these programs are registered with the Ministry of Education. These six programs are offered in our school building which is comprised of five classrooms and one larger room, in addition to the kitchen and offices. We also offer Spanish classes to foreigners, which help fund our community education initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Our programs include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Manos de Colores (Colored Hands) is an after school and vacation program for children in primary school. Children have access to a trained Guatemalan teacher to help with their homework and to reinforce weak areas of study. They also receive additional classes in art, English, theatre, and teamwork with foreign and local volunteers. Children also receive a small snack since some of the children in the area may not get lunch. Currently we have 30 – 40 children showing up every day, double the amount of last year, with new children signing up every week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primeria Acelerada (Accelerated Primary) is a program designed for learners older than 14 years old to finish first through sixth grade on Saturdays. A student can expect to finish the entire program start to finish in two years. Last year, we had 12 graduates of this program, and this year we have 32 students enrolled. In the next year, we expect these numbers to continue growing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educación Básica (Basic Education) is secondary education, the equivalent of seventh through ninth grade. This is a new program that we started offering this year to teens. Students study in the afternoons on school days. As a new program, we are only offering the first year (Primero Básico or seventh grade) and will begin offer the second year (Segundo Básico or eighth grade) next year. There are eight students currently enrolled in this program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educación Básica for adults over 18 years of age is offered on Sundays. This is also a new program and we currently have seven students enrolled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bachillerato is the equivalent of high school. We are offering this at night from six until nine on weekdays. This is also a new program of this year and we currently have three students enrolled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>English classes are open to the whole community. The majority of students are teens and young adults trying to open up new work opportunities. These classes are taught by foreign volunteers and are flexible depending on the students and teachers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our seventh, off-site program is in local public schools. When there are enough volunteers, we send them to teach English classes in the schools to help fulfill the curriculum requirement to schools that simply don't have money to hire a qualified English teacher.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Future Plans</strong></h3>
<p>Because of our growing popularity in the community and rising enrollment, we have plans to start offering several new programs.</p>
<p>In the next year, we would like to offer regular primary school for children in addition to our after school program. We are also interested in having a free daycare centre so that mothers in the community are freer to work or study in order to improve their family economy.</p>
<p>In order to accommodate growth in our current programs and to be able to provide additional programs, we need to expand our physical building. We have purchased a 200-square-metre piece of land adjacent to the school with the help of a grant and are planning to build 6 – 8 classrooms and a play area for the children. We have worked out a budget to fence off the land and build the first level of classrooms (4 classrooms – two on each side). In the future we may construct a second level of classrooms, however this is not included in the current budget.</p>
<p>This is our current budget of funds for work materials for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>3 concrete walls to fence off the area (10m, 12.6m, 24m x 3.8m high) – Q103,305 ($13,416.23 USD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 concrete calls to serve as dividers between classrooms (5m each x 3.8m high) – Q25,000 ($3,246.75 USD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wooden beams to support roof (40) – Q20,000 ($2,597.40 USD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tin corrugated roofing – Q10,000 ($1,298.70 USD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metal doors (4) – Q6,000 ($779.20 USD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Metal windowframes (4) – Q4,000 ($519.48 USD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wood for ceilings – Q5,000 ($649.35 USD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electrical – Q7,000 ($909.09 USD)</p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Total: Q180,000 ($23,376.00 USD)</strong></p>
<p>Please note that the exchange rate used is 7.7Q per USD and is subject to fluctuations.</p>
<p>As you can see, the project will end up costing twice the amount of what we are requesting. Additional funds not obtained through this fundraiser would come from income raised by the Spanish school and from loans.</p>
<h3><strong>Who Are the People We Help?</strong></h3>
<p>We'd like to share with you two stories:</p>
<p>José and his sister Heidi attend Manos de Colores every afternoon. Their parents do not know how to read or write. They also have a younger sister who they take with them to the school although she is too young for the program – there is nobody at home to look after her. José is 12 and has special needs. The public school refuses to accept him. Although what we can do for him is very little, we think that it is important that he feel accepted in the school and that he learn basic math skills and reading. Heidi is 9 and is enrolled in first grade for the third time. Her mother is desperate because she fears that next year she will not be able to afford for her to repeat the grade again. Heidi struggles a lot with reading and writing and here she receives one-on-one support from a local teacher who can help her succeed this year. We hope that their younger sister will eventually have the opportunity to attend school as well and to succeed. We are definitely ready to support and assist her in whatever she needs!</p>
<p>Juan Pedro started not by studying, but by working at El Nahual as a maintenance worker when he was a teenager. He had not yet finished his schooling, but used the job to support his secondary education, which he completed on Sundays. He supported us in our community projects, which at the time included an organic garden where local women could grow food to support their families. After finishing his studies, he started to work with us as a Spanish teacher for foreign students, continuing to support us in our community projects. During his time as a Spanish teacher, he also attended university. Now, he is a Math teacher and comes and helps us in Manos de Colores in school break in order to reach children in the area and inspire them to complete their studies like he did. Although he didn't study with us, Juan Pedro is a shining example of what a person can acheive when they see the value in education, and he continues to be a welcome part of our community.</p>
<p>When our new school building is built, we will be able to serve and support more children and more families in education. We will be able to help children like Heidi finish their education and find a profession like Juan did. Please help support us in realizing this dream for the children and families in the communities of Quetzaltenango!</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Make a Difference</strong></h3>
<p>We very much appreciate your support with our project! If you are unable to give right now, there are a few other ways that you can help. We always welcome Spanish students, who support our program through the fees they pay and by their volunteer work. We also welcome volunteers who have more than three weeks to offer and a basic to intermediate level of Spanish to help teach classes and provide administrative and promotional support. If none of these things are possible for you, we would really appreciate you simply sharing the word! Share the link to this page or to our website – maybe someone you know could help us out as well!

<p>I’m graduating from Western Washington University this June!  I managed to graduate on time in four years, with a major in Cultural Anthropology and a certificate/minor in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages).  As the graduation deadline gets closer, it makes me reflect on how much I accomplished, learned, and experienced in such a short amount of time; as well as become anxious to start the new chapter of my life!  I’d like to say I know my exact career path, but I can’t yet.  What I can say is, I’m ready to apply my degree with hands on experience this summer.</p>
<p>For my last two quarters, I have been working with Trish Skillman, the director of the TESOL program at WWU, and Steven Vanderstaay, the Vice Provo of Undergraduate Education, Professor of English, and director of the collaborative international service-learning project, <em>Building Bridges in Rwanda</em>. </p>
<p><em>Building Bridges in Rwanda</em> is focused on helping the citizens of Gashora.  One of their top requests from our program is English instruction in the local health center.</p>
<p>Rwanda's community health system is well known as one of the best in Africa. In ten short years, Rwanda has drastically reduced rates of AIDs, Malaria, malnutrition and other infectious diseases. The heroes in this effort are the community health workers who travel by foot or bicycle to the rural communities, who I will be working with. <br/><br/> With English recently becoming a national language in Rwanda, the medicine labels and medical training materials are printed in English. Yet most health workers don't speak English. That's why service projects like this, which provide English instruction for community health workers, are so crucial.<br/><br/> Americans are very welcome in Rwanda. The community health center I will be teaching in was built with aid from the United States. With your help, I can help make the center even more effective by teaching the health workers English.  Steven went to Gashora in February with some of the materials I created and came back with an outstanding review of how beneficial it was to the health workers.</p>
<p>Here is a section of an email from Steven:</p>
<p><em>""We provided ESL instruction at the Health Center for 4 days. I taught material that reviewed the curriculum we taught at the health center last summer and a packet of material that you created for us. The students appreciated my review but were thrilled by the curricula you provided. Your health-related English materials were very culturally appropriate and at a level that worked for the health workers.<br/></em></p>
<p><em>The health workers were also very pleased with the laminated flash cards you provided; they have added these to their library so that students can use them and check them out.</em></p>
<p><em>The health workers were very excited about the possibility that you could provide a curricula of 4 weeks of health-related English materials for them in the summer.”</em></p>
<p>Currently, I’m creating the 4-week curricula for the health center. </p>
<p>With my expertise in TESOL and the program needing an extra hand in English instruction and management of the classroom, I have been asked to go on the program this summer as a WWU faculty member!

I’m graduating from Western Washington University this June!  I managed to graduate on time in four years, with a major in Cultural Anthropology and a certificate/minor in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages).  As the graduation deadline gets closer, it makes me reflect on how much I accomplished, learned, and experienced in such a short amount of time; as well as become anxious to start the new chapter of my life!  I’d like to say I know my exact career path, but I can’t yet.  What I can say is, I’m ready to apply my degree with hands on experience this summer.
For my last two quarters, I have been working with Trish Skillman, the director of the TESOL program at WWU, and Steven Vanderstaay, the Vice Provo of Undergraduate Education, Professor of English, and director of the collaborative international service-learning project, Building Bridges in Rwanda. 
Building Bridges in Rwanda is focused on helping the citizens of Gashora.  One of their top requests from our program is English instruction in the local health center.
Rwanda's community health system is well known as one of the best in Africa. In ten short years, Rwanda has drastically reduced rates of AIDs, Malaria, malnutrition and other infectious diseases. The heroes in this effort are the community health workers who travel by foot or bicycle to the rural communities, who I will be working with.  With English recently becoming a national language in Rwanda, the medicine labels and medical training materials are printed in English. Yet most health workers don't speak English. That's why service projects like this, which provide English instruction for community health workers, are so crucial. Americans are very welcome in Rwanda. The community health center I will be teaching in was built with aid from the United States. With your help, I can help make the center even more effective by teaching the health workers English.  Steven went to Gashora in February with some of the materials I created and came back with an outstanding review of how beneficial it was to the health workers.
Here is a section of an email from Steven:
""We provided ESL instruction at the Health Center for 4 days. I taught material that reviewed the curriculum we taught at the health center last summer and a packet of material that you created for us. The students appreciated my review but were thrilled by the curricula you provided. Your health-related English materials were very culturally appropriate and at a level that worked for the health workers.
The health workers were also very pleased with the laminated flash cards you provided; they have added these to their library so that students can use them and check them out.
The health workers were very excited about the possibility that you could provide a curricula of 4 weeks of health-related English materials for them in the summer.”
Currently, I’m creating the 4-week curricula for the health center. 
With my expertise in TESOL and the program needing an extra hand in English instruction and management of the classroom, I have been asked to go on the program this summer as a WWU faculty member! This is a volunteer based program for myself, as I will be an alumnus from WWU.  The program is paying for my flight, but I have to pay for the rest of the trip.  The total cost of the trip is $1,500 for lodging, meals, service learning projects, travel/health insurance, and excursions and transportation in Rwanda. 
With your donation, you will be contributing to my future goals of becoming an ESL teacher as well as the passion I have for other cultures and travelling.  You will also be contributing to strengthening and sustaining Gashora’s community and people.
Everything that is fundraised will go directly to the program.  As little as $10 will be immensely helpful!  If I don’t reach my goal, I will pay for the rest out of pocket. 
I thank you for taking your time in reading this, and hope you consider donating to an opportunity that will be life changing and rewarding in so many ways.

<h3><strong>What is Ringette?</strong></h3>
<p>Ringette is a Canadian game that was first introduced in 1963 in North Bay, Ontario. Developed originally for girls, Ringette is a fast paced team sport on ice in which players use a straight stick to pass, carry, and shoot a rubber ring to score goals.</p>
<p>For ten years play centered in Ontario and Quebec, however the sport quickly spread across Canada and is now played in all ten provinces and the Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>In fact, the sport has become one of Canada's favorite activities for females, with over 50,000 participants, including players, coaches, officials and volunteers, across Canada - a remarkable growth rate for such a young sport.</p>
<p>More than 7,000 certified ringette coaches are registered in the National Coaching Certification Program, and 1,724 registered referees trained under Ringette Canada's National Officiating Program. In addition, there are thousands of volunteers who administer clubs, leagues, and tournaments across Canada.</p>
<p><em><strong>HOW WE PLAY</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><em>We play with a ring and a straight stick</em></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The ring is hollow and made of rubber. Sticks are not recycled hockey sticks. Companies produce sticks with tapered ends with steel, aluminum or plastic tips. Different styles, flex and weight are available.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>We pass the ring at every blue line</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A player cannot carry the ring over a blue line in either direction. The ring must be passed over the blue line to another teammate. The teammate is permitted to skate ahead of the ring carrier and already be across the blue line before the ring crosses it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>We never enter the goalkeeper's crease</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">If the ring lands in or on the crease, the only player who can touch it is the goalkeeper. The goalkeeper usually picks up the ring and throws to the teammate. The goalie has five seconds to pass it out of her crease.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>We have 30 seconds to take a shot on net</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Teams have 30 seconds to take a shot on goal after they gain possession of the ring. If time runs out a buzzer sounds and the other team is awarded the ring.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><em>We play 3 on 3 in the offensive zones</em></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">You will notice the free play lines (small red line at the top of the circles) on the ice. From this line to the end boards, it's a game of 3 on 3. Players can rotate in and out of the free play zones producing a lot of movement and creativity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>We wear protective equipment</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Players wear a neck guard, elbow, knee, and shin pads and equipment that provides hip and tailbone protection. Helmets with full face mask are mandatory. The masks must have triangular or tight horizontal bars to prevent the stick from penetrating.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>We don't body check</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Ringette promotes a no-contact policy when it comes to the physical aspect of its game. Penalties are given when a player makes excessive body contact with another player, checks a player too high on the stick, trips, hits or interferes with another player.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>How did Ringette Get to Ann Arbor, Michigan?</strong></h3>
<p>During the 2011-2012 hockey season in Ann Arbor, some of the hockey coaches would run a drill in which players flipped their sticks upside down and had to keep control of a ring. Although this was definitely not Ringette, the players were told they were playing a version of the game. One of the players really enjoyed this particular drill and wanted to know more about it. After looking it up online, she asked her dad if she could play Ringette the following year instead of hockey. Her dad quickly found that not only were there no Ringette clubs in Michigan, there were currently none in the United States. After contacting Ringette Canada to get more information (the governing body for the sport) he agreed to start a club so his daughter could play.</p>
<p>In February 2012, Ann Arbor Ringette held their first Come Try Ringette FREE event and 34 kids showed up to try it. The first season was spring of 2012. A U14/U16/U19 team was fielded for the 2012-2013 season. To date the team has 13 players that have played 6 games against Canadian Ringette teams. We are actively recruiting and hope to have more kids next season.</p>

<h3>Help Ann Arbor Ringette Start a Learn To Skate - Learn To Play Ringette Program!</h3>
<p>Ann Arbor Ringette has worked tirelessly to grow the sport of Ringette in Michigan. We feel we have done well so far but would really like to grow the game for kids between the ages of 5 and 8. Doing this will instill a love for Ringette in the participants. This love for the game will stick with them as they get older which will allow us to offer more programs as they age (U9, U10, U12, U14, U16, and U19).</p>
<p>To grow the game, we would like to offer a Learn to Skate - Learn to Play program for kids ages 5 to 8.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need To Make It Happen</h3>
To attract interest and players, we need to make the Learn to Skate - Learn to Play program very inexpensive. This is where you come in. We would like to offer a 5 to 6 month program during the 2013-2014 season in which players skate and play once per week. This program would be for kids ages 5 to 8. Ice time is expensive. On top of that, players need practice jerseys and equipment. Ice sports are typically unattainable for many children due to the price. We would like to change that and need your help to do it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We would like to offer this program for no more than $120. This would include ice time and jerseys. In order for us to make this happen at that price, we need lots of funding. If we don't meet our goal, the money raised will still be used by our Ringette club either to buy more loaner equipment, subsidize ice time or to give scholarships to needy players.</div>
<div>
<h3>How You Can Impact Our Community and Sport</h3>
Reaching our goal will allow us to offer a Learn to Skate - Learn to Play Ringette program for kids ages 5 to 8 in Ann Arbor, Michigan during the 2013-2014 season with minimal to no financial risk. This gets lots of kids out on the ice that may not be able to afford it otherwise. It also helps to grow the amazing sport of Ringette here in Michigan (and the United States).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If nothing else, you're helping to put smiles on the faces of up to 60 kids for 5 to 6 months.</div>
<div>

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>After visiting a women's cooperative in Rwanda, Colleen, Anna, and I were inspired to form Handmade Peace to help the women that we met and others bring their beautiful handmade products to consumers in the United States.</p>
<p>We are all graduate students in the various areas of peacebuilding, human rights, anthropology, and international law and we all share the common goal of using our careers to make fundamental human rights a reality for people all over the world. Anna Rushton, our co-founder and budding visual anthropologist, recently had her very first documentary ever picked up by PBS!! Encouraged by this recognition, she will be filming  our work throughout the year. </p>
<p><strong>The Idea</strong></p>
<p>Handmade Peace is a peacebuilding through economic stability initiative.  Our ultimate goal is to contribute to sustainable peace and a world free from mass atrocity - an objective very dear to the Rwandans that we have met in light of the 1994 genocide that Rwanda endured.</p>
<p>We believe that poverty is a major contributor to conflict.  Structural marginalization and systemic social and economic injustice breeds unrest and disaffected populations. When we as humans are unable to care for our families we tend to look for a scapegoat to blame. This angst exacerbates racial, religious, ethnic and political tensions. Poverty is a real threat to on-going peace worldwide. </p>
<p>Therefore, in an effort to promote economic stability among some of the most vulnerable, we are establishing Handmade Peace. Not only will we promote and distribute the products of the women's cooperative to consumers in the U.S. (who we are sure will love them!) via e-commerce, but also support the women in a series of business strengthening initiatives to help grow their successful model. As with any rooted systematic change, we believe the fiercest changemakers come from within the community (not imported ""experts"".) By partnering and supporting local leaders who can serve as mentors, employers and an inspiration for others in their community the ownership of action is grassroots based. Instead of creating another cycle of dependency we strive to invest in and encourage homemade economic security. We are starting our work selling the products of this particular cooperative, that inspired Handmade Peace, but we intend to expand to include the handmade products of vulnerable groups in other post-conflict countries in our efforts.</p>
<p><strong>The Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Colleen Creegan, Co-founder and Executive Director, was honored to be named as one of this year’s global Dalai Lama Fellows for this project. As part of that fellowship, which encourages compassion in action, she was able to secure us seed money that will enable us to pay for our initial year of programming and buy a small amount of inventory. Despite this ringing endorsement and show of support, there are still many other costs associated with starting an organization from scratch and running it smoothly, which is why we need your help!</p>
<p><strong>Start-up costs include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Incorporation and registration fees.</em></li>
<li><em>Maintaing the website</em></li>
<li><em>Marketing/Advertising</em></li>
<li>
<em>Branding</em> (we will hand make our own tags so that the items purchased can be indentified HMP and in support of peacebuilding.)  </li>
<li>
<em>Shipping and transpor</em>t</li>
<li>
<em>MORE INVENTORY!</em> We are lucky enough to have many retailers interested in carrying our products. We want to ensure that we ship enough inventory to fill those orders and have enough left over to sell directly to consumers via our website)</li>
<li>
<em>Promotion/Networking</em>: Just recently Colleen was invited to present HMP at the 2012 Poverty Action Conference in Virginia this fall. We will to travel to this and other development conferences/trade shows/business competitions to promote our model and engage with investors and grant makers. (None of us will make a salary or be compensated from the money raised here, but travel and accommodations will be incorporated into our yearly budget)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Any additional money raised could be used for a number of things:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting the filmmaking</li>
<li>Continued technical and IT support for the cooperative</li>
<li>Even more inventory (in the end the more money that goes to the cooperative as earned income the more successful we will be)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Looking for other ways to get involved?</strong></p>
<p>If you are unable contribute to our campaign at this time, but would like to support Handmade Peace, please spread the word about our organization among your networks. The more you talk about us, the less we have to spend of advertising :-) Shout it out, whisper it, gossip about us, tweet, blog, do an interpretative dance or send smoke signals out. We have a FB Fan Page, you can join the email list. In addition, please consider using the Indiegogo share tools to help promote our campaign!</p>
<p>A huge thank you for taking the time to read about us and getting to know our inspiration and motivation. At the end of the day it’s about participating in a global citizenship and standing up for peace by the power of your purchases. We are gratefully indebted to you for your love, time and financial support!</p>

We will to travel to this and other development conferences/trade shows/business competitions to promote our model and engage with investors and grant makers. (None of us will make a salary or be compensated from the money raised here, but travel and accommodations will be incorporated into our yearly budget)

 
Any additional money raised could be used for a number of things:

Supporting the filmmaking
Continued technical and IT support for the cooperative
Even more inventory (in the end the more money that goes to the cooperative as earned income the more successful we will be)

<p>We seek your
funding support to help us start the Emerging &amp; Frontier Markets
Association which will help<span> 
companies start  up or
expand their businesses in the fastest growing  markets in Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.  The Association will focus on providing
tax, legal and financial information to help executives and professionals gain
the insight they need to operate successfully in these emerging markets.</span></p>
<p>These markets increasingly are  becoming important for global economic activity. Emerging
markets have been identified by recent fast economic growth. Examples are the
BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), Mexico, and many of the Asian
nations. Frontier Markets refers to countries poised to be the next group of
developing nations to see an economic boom. Examples may be Colombia, Peru,
Indonesia, Vietnam, Turkey, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and selected other
countries in Africa. </p>
<p>Many
commentators expect that before long these markets could represent 46% of
global GDP. <a href=""#_edn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[i]</span></span></a> Yet despite
this great wave of expansion, for executives coping with the details of such
investment including taxes, structuring foreign investments, M&amp;A and  joint venture strategies, consumer and
employment rules, and environmental regulations, authoritative information is
often very limited, particularly in the attractive markets of Africa. </p>
<p>The Association
will fill an important information need by giving small, medium and large
companies the information they need to operate in<span>  parts of the world with tremendous growth potential and
limited information concerning tax, law and finance. This will encourage
foreign direct investment in emerging and frontier markets and will result in
increased employment, knowledge transfer, and improved standard of livings. The
information will go well beyond the business opportunity or stock market
context of many information services into the “nuts and bolts” type of information that cannot
be found in any other place. </span></p>
<p>The Association
will provide virtual and live educational seminars, round table events, and
hubs of information to give companies the “how-to” intelligence they need to
operate in a part of the world with tremendous growth potential and limited
information. The first programs will emphasize tax and law issues in some of
the attractive markets in Africa. A big four accounting firm in New York, and a
law firm in Boston are willing to provide space and speakers for an initial
program on legal aspects of doing the deal in Africa. Later programs and hubs will
cover Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>The organizers of EFMA are two individuals, Gary Brown and
Robert Ross, with long experience in creating information services and programs
to help multinational corporate executives overcome barriers in international
emerging markets. Gary Brown was founder and CEO for over 25 years of a company which created and managed services covering some of the
fastest growing countries in Asia and Latin America and the most difficult
areas to obtain quality legal and financial information. For 25 years Robert
Ross was founder and CEO of two continuing professional education companies
which focused on international tax, finance and law. Gary sold his business to
Thomson Reuters, which was looking to expand its tax and legal offerings, and
Robert Ross sold his business to Bloomberg BNA, another major international law
and tax publisher.</p>
<h3>What is needed</h3>
<p>This campaign is looking to raise
$50,000. The purpose will be to design the web site, to promote the first
program and memberships, and to compensate authors for authoritative,
distinctive content. The first programs will emphasize tax and law issues in
some of the attractive markets in Africa.<span> 
</span></p><span> </span><p>It is anticipated that
the Association will become self funding by having major law, accounting,
consulting and banking firms become either individual or corporate members.
Membership will entitle individuals to attend round tables and to receive
electronic reports. </p>
<p>If the full $50,000 is
not raised promotion of the first program and memberships will be more
difficult, but any funds received will be spent for organizational and
promotional purposes.</p><p>The following is a sample web page from the Tax, Law, Finance Africa Hub.The Association will feature Hubs of many important markets. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/368343/files/20140213102344-darkerofficialAfricapage.png?1392315824"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p><br/></p>
<h3>The Importance of the Association: More
Details</h3>
<p>Foreign direct
investment (FDI) has surged into developing and frontier nations over the last
decade. Global corporations invested more in emerging markets than the core
economies of U.S., Europe and Japan, according to the United Nations Conference
on Trade &amp; Development (UNCTAD) World Investment Report published in
mid-2013.<span>  Such inflows provide
capital to boost the recipients’ development. This is especially important for
countries with low savings rates. FDI creates jobs in the recipient country and
brings technical know-how and managerial expertise that can improve
competitiveness. China’s success in achieving FDI-fuelled economic expansion
over three decades demonstrates the allure of these flows.</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately,
for executives coping with the details of such investments, authoritative
information on the operation of local tax, law, regulatory and financial
requirements is critical to the success of the venture but hard to access. It
is very expensive to hire firms with answers or to know the questions to ask.. </p>
<p>To help solve
these issues, the Association will provide a place to go when an executive
needs to compare what he/she knows with someone else. Through networking
events, round tables and social media there will be a place to ask questions of
other members who have been in the trenches of a particular emerging or
frontier market. It will be a place where peers may discuss experiences and
solutions.</p>
<p>In addition, the experienced executives organizing the
Association will be able to bring in the right people to help continuously
update the information hubs and electronic briefings which will be a key part
of the Association.</p>
<p>Hubs will be
created for specific regions. For example, a Hub focused on Africa is shown,
entitled Tax, Law, Finance Africa.<span> 
According to a recent McKinsey &amp; Company report, the rate of return
on foreign investment is higher in Africa than in any other developing region.
Although there are many differences and serious challenges in Africa’s 50 plus
individual economies, (only the most promising would be covered in the Hub) the
continent’s collective GDP at $1.6 trillion in 2008, is now roughly equal to
Brazil’s or Russia’s, and according to McKinsey “the continent is among the
word’s most rapidly growing economic regions.” <a href=""#_edn2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>[ii]</span></a></span></p>
<p>Reflecting the
increase business activity in Africa, growth has caused many major law,
accounting, consulting firms, and investment banking firms to stake out
practices in the key industries under development in Africa including:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Oil
&amp; gas</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Mining</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Power</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Transportation
and Infrastructure</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Telecommunications</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Consumer
goods</p>
<ul><li>Private equity and finance</li></ul><p>These
firms provide occasional and irregular reports on some of their practice areas,
but there is a need for more regular reporting and a site which organizes as
much information as possible.</p>
<h3>Successful Track Record</h3><p></p><p></p><h3>
</h3><p></p><p></p><p>As mentioned above,
the organizers have long experience in creating information services and programs
to support attorneys, accountants and senior corporate executives who are
making decisions on the proper structure for multinational businesses. </p>
<p>With the backing of
lawyers at Hale &amp; Dorr (now Wilmer Hale) and Kramer Levin and a business
executive investor, Gary founded WorldTrade Executive (WTE) in 1991, which came
to publish 20 information services and journals in international law and
finance along with related books and reports. Representative titles published
by Gary include a series on <i>Practical International Tax Strategies</i> with regional
editions for Asia, China, Latin America, and the US; <i>Latin American Law
&amp; Business Report</i>; <i>Venture Equity Latin America</i>; <i>Practical
International Corporate Finance Strategies</i>; <i>Russian Petroleum Investor</i>, and other titles. </p>
<p>Gary sold these
services to Thomson Reuters in 2009 as TR sought to expand its international
tax and legal offerings, and Gary continued to manage the publications until
December 2013. </p>
<p>Gary also
created conferences and webinars on topics covered by the various publications
over the years, including one in partnership with Dow Jones and another in
partnership with Chase Bank. Prior to creating WorldTrade Executive, Gary created <i>Middle East Executive Reports</i> and <i>East Asian Executive Reports</i>, covering law and business issues in these parts of the world.<br/></p>
<p>Gary earned a J.D. from Georgetown
University Law School.</p>
<p>For 25 years
Robert Ross was founder and CEO of two continuing professional education
companies which focused on international tax, finance and law. One entity was
organized as a non-profit association, The Council for International Tax
Education (CITE) and the other had a corporate for- profit structure, Atlas Information
Group. In 2009 the two enterprises were sold to Bloomberg BNA, and Robert
served as a consultant to Bloomberg BNA for three additional years.</p>
<p>Prior to
creating CITE and Atlas, Robert served for three years as First Vice President
and New York representative of Vereins and West Bank , a Hamburg based trade
finance and commercial bank with strong activities in Latin America via its
Miami office. He also spent four years as a Vice President with American
Express Bank in New York and Brussels and with a British bank, UDT in London
where he focused on sales finance, trade finance and M&amp;A activities. Robert
has an MBA from NYU, Stern School of Business.</p>
<h3>Important Impact Not Diminished
by Recent Capital Markets News</h3>
<p>The Association
will fill an important information need by giving small, medium and large
companies the information they need to operate in a part of the world with
tremendous growth potential and limited information concerning tax, law and
finance.. </p>
<p>The annual
figures from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development<span>  (UNCTAD) as reported in the Wall Street
Journal’s Real Time Economics Blog, show that emerging and frontier markets are
taking an ever bigger part of the pie of foreign investment even despite global
financial turmoil,. UNCTAD reported 
at the end of January 2014 that inflows of foreign direct investment
around the world climbed 11% in 2013 to about $1.46 trillion, from $1.32
trillion.  In 2012 the U.S. and
other developed nations saw their share of total FDI inflows little changed
from the 39% of 2012. Growth has been primarily in emerging and frontier
markets. </span></p>
<p>In past days,
capital markets and currencies in nations including India, Turkey, Argentina
and South Africa have been hammered by a sell off. However, such abrupt shifts
in “portfolio” investing shouldn’t be confused with the long-term trends in
foreign direct investment flows, said Matthew Slaughter, a professor at
Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, quoted in the WSJ blog. <a href=""#_edn3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[iii]</span></span></a>He
pointed out that “oftentimes, the impetus of FDI flows can be quite different
from the portfolio flows.”</p>
<p>Unlike the
market snapshot, the UNCTAD data are “a low-frequency, long-term signal of
where the world’s most productive companies are seeing business opportunities,”
Mr. Slaughter said. The latest report offers “information about where these
companies are placing their strategic bets,”<a href=""#_edn4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[iv]</span></span></a>
and the information indicates very strong foreign investment in emerging and
frontier markets.</p>
<p>The Association
will start with African countries with the most attractive growth potential and
will add other markets in Asia and Latin America. Users will gain information
and the ability to network with other like-minded executives to navigate the
minefields and complexities of operating successful enterprises in parts of the
world that will have tremendous growth but in which information is quite
difficult to access.</p>
<h3><b>We Need Your
Support</b></h3>
You the crowd funding support person will make it possible to develop
this Association with its important networking and information exchange
capabilities. You will benefit from the various premiums we have structured for
you, such as the ability to access a Hub or to participate in various
networking events

Journal’s Real Time Economics Blog, show that emerging and frontier markets are
taking an ever bigger part of the pie of foreign investment even despite global
financial turmoil,. UNCTAD reported 
at the end of January 2014 that inflows of foreign direct investment
around the world climbed 11% in 2013 to about $1.46 trillion, from $1.32
trillion.  In 2012 the U.S. and
other developed nations saw their share of total FDI inflows little changed
from the 39% of 2012. Growth has been primarily in emerging and frontier
markets. 
In past days,
capital markets and currencies in nations including India, Turkey, Argentina
and South Africa have been hammered by a sell off. However, such abrupt shifts
in “portfolio” investing shouldn’t be confused with the long-term trends in
foreign direct investment flows, said Matthew Slaughter, a professor at
Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business, quoted in the WSJ blog. [iii]He
pointed out that “oftentimes, the impetus of FDI flows can be quite different
from the portfolio flows.”
Unlike the
market snapshot, the UNCTAD data are “a low-frequency, long-term signal of
where the world’s most productive companies are seeing business opportunities,”
Mr. Slaughter said. The latest report offers “information about where these
companies are placing their strategic bets,”[iv]
and the information indicates very strong foreign investment in emerging and
frontier markets.
The Association
will start with African countries with the most attractive growth potential and
will add other markets in Asia and Latin America. Users will gain information
and the ability to network with other like-minded executives to navigate the
minefields and complexities of operating successful enterprises in parts of the
world that will have tremendous growth but in which information is quite
difficult to access.
We Need Your
Support
You the crowd funding support person will make it possible to develop
this Association with its important networking and information exchange
capabilities. You will benefit from the various premiums we have structured for
you, such as the ability to access a Hub or to participate in various
networking events

to Northwest Washington.  I am also an alumnus
of the Fulbright Program, I hold a BA in Psychology from Gonzaga University and will be attending medical school in the
fall of 2014.  Currently, I work with an
inspiring non-profit called Magicians Without Borders. The mission of Magicians Without Borders (MWB) is to
use the art of magic in order to entertain, educate, and empower the forgotten
children of the world. </p><p>Last year, during my Fulbright Scholarship year in Colombia, I developed a sustainable Magic Project in collaboration with MWB.  On February 23, 2014 I will travel to India on behalf of MWB, where I will teach the art of magic to daughters of sex workers from the brutal brothels of Mumbai.  I have seen firsthand how learning magic can transform the challenged life of a child growing up in the slums into one of limitless dreams and aspirations.</p><p>By supporting Magicians Without Borders in India, you will bring magic and hope to some of the world's most forgotten children.  We have been traveling to India for 3 years, but never for longer than 2 weeks at a time.  Our goal for my three months in India is to deepen our students' passion for learning magic while more fully integrating our program into the community of Mumbai magicians.  With the collaboration of Mumbai magicians, our magic students will be able to attend weekly magic classes rather than just a few classes a year.  This will make our program in India sustainable, just as it is in Bogota, Colombia where our students were recently recruited to perform at a holiday party for one of the country's most prominent banks. </p><p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/WUQ7wIFVDZA"" width=""560""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need </h3><p>This campaign will supplement our total India budget and without these funds, this project will not be possible.  Magicians Without Borders is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit so 100% of your contribution is tax-deductible.  All of the funds raised from this campaign will go directly to improving our program in India. This campaign will contribute:</p><p>$1,000 for magic props that our students will keep</p><p>$750 for program logistics such as transporting our students to performances and taking them out of the city for a weekend magic camp</p><p>$750 towards my airfare of $1,250</p><p>If additional funds are received, they will go directly towards closing the gap on our total budget which is just under $5,000.  This is your opportunity to become a supporter of MWB and contribute to the sustainability of our work in India.  </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Your support will have a lasting effect.  We are at a turning point for our project in India and have decided to go all in.  Having boots on the ground for three months instead of two weeks will allow us to deepen our connection with our students and become more fully integrated into the community of magicians in Mumbai.  Our students in India have been performing semi-regularly and they will thrive at a whole new level with the increased frequency of classes and attention.  Once we have a strong core group of students, these very students will then pay it forward and teach what they have learned to new students.  </p><p>We realize that not all of our students will become seasoned magicians.  That is not our goal.  However, if they develop a desire to learn and an understanding that they are capable, then we have done our job.  We have a scholarship fund that supports our magic students to continue their formal education if they choose to do so.</p><p>Rosalba Martinez, the lead coordinator from Bella Flor in Colombia stated,  “Since these children have been studying magic they attend the program more regularly, coming two or three times a week to practice their magic. They are more responsible and punctual. They are becoming leaders with the other children.”<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/292974/files/20140105181358-DSCN3919.JPG?1388974438"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>The success of the Colombia Project, which I developed and continue to direct can assure you that your contribution will be utilized in a meaningful manner. We cannot bring magic into the lives of forgotten children and families in the far corners of the world without you!   </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Spread the word! Our work requires more than financial support.  We are able to go out into the world and create magic because we are supported back home.  Please stay in touch, we could not do this without you.  And, please help us get the word out and keep the magic alive by sharing this campaign with your social networks.  Thank you!!</p><p><br/></p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryMy name is Ryan Bart and I am a 23 year old magician native

of the Fulbright Program, I hold a BA in Psychology from Gonzaga University and will be attending medical school in the
fall of 2014.  Currently, I work with an
inspiring non-profit called Magicians Without Borders. The mission of Magicians Without Borders (MWB) is to
use the art of magic in order to entertain, educate, and empower the forgotten
children of the world. Last year, during my Fulbright Scholarship year in Colombia, I developed a sustainable Magic Project in collaboration with MWB.  On February 23, 2014 I will travel to India on behalf of MWB, where I will teach the art of magic to daughters of sex workers from the brutal brothels of Mumbai.  I have seen firsthand how learning magic can transform the challenged life of a child growing up in the slums into one of limitless dreams and aspirations.By supporting Magicians Without Borders in India, you will bring magic and hope to some of the world's most forgotten children.  We have been traveling to India for 3 years, but never for longer than 2 weeks at a time.  Our goal for my three months in India is to deepen our students' passion for learning magic while more fully integrating our program into the community of Mumbai magicians.  With the collaboration of Mumbai magicians, our magic students will be able to attend weekly magic classes rather than just a few classes a year.  This will make our program in India sustainable, just as it is in Bogota, Colombia where our students were recently recruited to perform at a holiday party for one of the country's most prominent banks. What We Need This campaign will supplement our total India budget and without these funds, this project will not be possible.  Magicians Without Borders is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit so 100% of your contribution is tax-deductible.  All of the funds raised from this campaign will go directly to improving our program in India. This campaign will contribute:$1,000 for magic props that our students will keep$750 for program logistics such as transporting our students to performances and taking them out of the city for a weekend magic camp$750 towards my airfare of $1,250If additional funds are received, they will go directly towards closing the gap on our total budget which is just under $5,000.  This is your opportunity to become a supporter of MWB and contribute to the sustainability of our work in India.  The ImpactYour support will have a lasting effect.  We are at a turning point for our project in India and have decided to go all in.  Having boots on the ground for three months instead of two weeks will allow us to deepen our connection with our students and become more fully integrated into the community of magicians in Mumbai.  Our students in India have been performing semi-regularly and they will thrive at a whole new level with the increased frequency of classes and attention.  Once we have a strong core group of students, these very students will then pay it forward and teach what they have learned to new students.  We realize that not all of our students will become seasoned magicians.  That is not our goal.  However, if they develop a desire to learn and an understanding that they are capable, then we have done our job.  We have a scholarship fund that supports our magic students to continue their formal education if they choose to do so.Rosalba Martinez, the lead coordinator from Bella Flor in Colombia stated,  “Since these children have been studying magic they attend the program more regularly, coming two or three times a week to practice their magic. They are more responsible and punctual. They are becoming leaders with the other children.”The success of the Colombia Project, which I developed and continue to direct can assure you that your contribution will be utilized in a meaningful manner. We cannot bring magic into the lives of forgotten children and families in the far corners of the world without you!   Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word! Our work requires more than financial support.  We are able to go out into the world and create magic because we are supported back home.  Please stay in touch, we could not do this without you.  And, please help us get the word out and keep the magic alive by sharing this campaign with your social networks.  Thank you!!",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

following values:


Fair play
Gender equality
Teamwork
Empathy
Responsibility

Sports For Sharing in the United States benefits from strong ties to its parent organization, Deportes para Compartir, an internationally-acclaimed not-for-profit that began in Mexico and which today is recognized by the United Nations, and supported by major companies such as Ford and Starbucks, for successfully building  programs with schools in many countries.

  The Impact

 

How did Isaac Camacho, a 12-year-old boy who participated in Sports for Sharing in Mexico, end up appearing on TEDxYouthDF as an agent of positive change?  By creating three projects to reduce waste in his community, an initiative directly inspired by games in our program such as ""Don't Spoil The Water"".  
The curriculum designed by our expert educators is a powerful learning tool that conveys knowledge about global issues and leverages play, the universal language of children. At the same time, because each of the Sports for Sharing activities emphasizes al least one of the eight United Nations Millennium Development Goals, children become fully aware of global challenges affecting people just like them around the world. Our games instill in them the value of participating in their community from an early age. 
Sports for Sharing fits perfectly with school administration and teaching staff priorities to assure that children come away from their classroom experience understanding and living values of tolerance and community building. After a year of piloting in the US, we have already registered a substantial impact among children participating in the program:

<h3>Who we are...</h3>
<p>      Shore Relief is a fund that has been set up in conjunction with Destiny Community Development Corporation (CDC) and New Beginnings Christian Church in Brick, NJ. Both organizations have been established and running community efforts in Ocean County for years. Destiny CDC, as well as New Beginnings Church, have a reputation of meeting the needs of  our community. Destiny CDC operates a food pantry in Brick, NJ and has been for over the past 6 years.<br/>      After Hurricane Sandy devistated our shores here in Ocean County on October 29th, many have been left homeless. We want to help these families and keep them warm and fed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>       Shore Relief is commited to bringing necessary items (food, clothing, blankets, socks, hygene products, water, etc.) to the people affected by this storm. Our current food pantry in Brick, NJ will be converted to a relief center to reach the families of Brick and northern Ocean County. We are commited to opening an addtional relief center in southern Ocean County to be able to reach more people. Our goal of $50,000.00 will go to open that relief center and stock both centers with the above necessities.</p>

<p>We have built this company around the idea that helping people meet and exceed their goals is our top priority. As we said in the video we are working with the V.A. to provide free training to current, transitioning, and retired military. We are working with state unemployment offices and other non-profits to provide reduced cost or free training for the unemployed.

<p>If we don't get the word out, which we need your help to do, the people who need this training most may never hear about the offers we have.

We will also set some of the money aside for helping someone you know (or don't know) get certified.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hello, my name is Melissa Wright. I am a student living in a small town in New Hampshire with my mom and younger brother. I am a photographer and graphic designer (or at least I try to be). I’m just your average 24 year old woman. You know, going to school, looking for a job, hanging out with friends, and being super geeky and proud of it. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot always enjoy life the way I want to. I live in consistent pain and feel ashamed because of the condition of my teeth. You may notice that in any pictures I've included are of me smiling, showing no teeth. Below this paragraph are pictures of the condition of my teeth. They are in such poor condition that they hardly seem worth calling teeth at this point. I hide my mouth in social situations; I feel like people judge me based on its appearance and possibly even make fun of me for it. Worse than all of that though, is the pain. Usually the pain is dull or just achy, and on good days I can’t even feel it at all (although those are few and far between). Then there are the bad days, really bad days where the pain is so excruciating I end up visiting the emergency room in the middle of the night to get something for the pain. Then of course I am left with the cost of a hospital bill for that little bit of relief. Over the years I have learned to ignore the looks I get, adapted to eat pretty normally, and for the most part I can suffer silently through the pain. Recently though, I thought I had found the answer to my dental problems.</p>
<p><img alt=""Teeth"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i464.photobucket.com/albums/rr8/Yay4EmoGlasses/blog/Teeth/Untitled-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt=""Teeth"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i464.photobucket.com/albums/rr8/Yay4EmoGlasses/blog/Teeth/Untitled-2-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A local non-profit dental clinic in the area took me on as a patient as of today (11/12/2012), and I have had two teeth extracted, leaving a remainder of 21 to be taken out before I can get dentures. However, there was a miscommunication regarding pricing. I was originally told that each appointment would cost $52 or so, and it was phrased in such a way that I believed that it would be covering everything done at each appointment. Then I was told that the entire set of dentures would cost me around $936. The original plan, based on the estimate as I understood it, was to make a down payment, pay the remaining balance bit by bit each month and have it paid off by February.</p>
<p>My appointment today cost $329, and I need at least 11 more of the same appointments to have the rest of the teeth extracted. A full set of dentures will cost me $936 for the top and an additional $936 for the bottom.  My costs are no expected to be in the neighborhood of $5000-$6000. I do not, nor will I anytime soon, have the money to pay for such costs. I am a student, unemployed, and uninsured. This kind of money is just not readily available. I was devastated of course when I found all of this out. I’d hate to be so close to a solution and to living a normal, pain free life only to have to give up because of my financial situation.</p>
<p>With all that being said, I am determined to find a way to pay for it. Anything any contributors can give would be a huge help. Even if I receive enough to pay for the next appointment or even just to pay the remaining balance for today’s appointment, it would be immensely helpful. If enough money was raised to pay for everything in full, I would be overwhelmed. I would never feel like I could thank you enough, but I would certainly try. Either way my life would be changed by some amazing, generous people who are caring enough to donate money to someone they don’t even know. I know my thanks would never be enough, but I will try my hardest to make it worth your while with the following <em><strong>perks:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>$5</strong>- A personal thank you email from me. I know it isn’t much, but I want to be able to thank each and every person who donates even a little bit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$10</strong>- A personalized thank you card. As an aspiring graphic designer one of the things I can offer are my skills. In this case, I would be sending you a thank you card designed and personalized by me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$25</strong>- A personalized thank you card and homemade candy. As a hobby I make candy and I would love to share that with contributors even if it may be a little ironic given what the cause is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$50</strong>- A personalized thank you card, homemade candy, and a 12x8 matte photo print out of my portfolio. Since I’m putting all of my skills out there I figured I’d offer some of my photography experience. If you can donate $50 to my cause I will send you a link to my portfolio where you can choose which photo you would like as a print.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$100</strong>- A personalized thank you card, homemade candy, and a 12x18 matte photo print.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$150</strong>- A personalized thank you card, homemade candy and an 11x14 canvas print.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$200</strong>- A personalized Thank You card, homemade candy, and my design services. This includes things like logos, shirts, business packages (envelope, stationery, and business card), etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$250</strong>- A personalized thank you card and a gift basket including homemade candy, a small photo print, baked goods and other various goodies. It’s a gift basket after all you have to be a little surprised at least.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$500</strong>- A personalized thank you card, homemade candy, a photo print of your choosing in any size you would like and either my design services or a gift basket.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$1000</strong>- Everything! Literally everything I have listed here. The thank you card, the candy, the photo print, the gift basket, my design services,  my eternal thanks, and if there is something else I can think of that too!</p>
<p> So, there it is. my story, what I would like to get out of this campaign, and what I want to give you in return. Remember anything you can give is greatly appreciated. If you can’t give financially I would be grateful to you if you could spread the word. Even if I don’t make my goal, any money at all will still help me make progress. Any progress I can make on this issue will lead to major improvements in my quality of life. Thank you so much in advance! I look forward to updating you all soon.</p></div>","Hello, my name is Melissa Wright. I am a student living in a small town in New Hampshire with my mom and younger brother.

Over the years I have learned to ignore the looks I get, adapted to eat pretty normally, and for the most part I can suffer silently through the pain. Recently though, I thought I had found the answer to my dental problems.

 
A local non-profit dental clinic in the area took me on as a patient as of today (11/12/2012), and I have had two teeth extracted, leaving a remainder of 21 to be taken out before I can get dentures. However, there was a miscommunication regarding pricing. I was originally told that each appointment would cost $52 or so, and it was phrased in such a way that I believed that it would be covering everything done at each appointment. Then I was told that the entire set of dentures would cost me around $936. The original plan, based on the estimate as I understood it, was to make a down payment, pay the remaining balance bit by bit each month and have it paid off by February.
My appointment today cost $329, and I need at least 11 more of the same appointments to have the rest of the teeth extracted. A full set of dentures will cost me $936 for the top and an additional $936 for the bottom.  My costs are no expected to be in the neighborhood of $5000-$6000. I do not, nor will I anytime soon, have the money to pay for such costs. I am a student, unemployed, and uninsured. This kind of money is just not readily available. I was devastated of course when I found all of this out. I’d hate to be so close to a solution and to living a normal, pain free life only to have to give up because of my financial situation.
With all that being said, I am determined to find a way to pay for it. Anything any contributors can give would be a huge help. Even if I receive enough to pay for the next appointment or even just to pay the remaining balance for today’s appointment, it would be immensely helpful. If enough money was raised to pay for everything in full, I would be overwhelmed. I would never feel like I could thank you enough, but I would certainly try. Either way my life would be changed by some amazing, generous people who are caring enough to donate money to someone they don’t even know. I know my thanks would never be enough, but I will try my hardest to make it worth your while with the following perks:
$5- A personal thank you email from me. I know it isn’t much, but I want to be able to thank each and every person who donates even a little bit.
 
$10- A personalized thank you card. As an aspiring graphic designer one of the things I can offer are my skills. In this case, I would be sending you a thank you card designed and personalized by me.
 
$25- A personalized thank you card and homemade candy. As a hobby I make candy and I would love to share that with contributors even if it may be a little ironic given what the cause is.
 
$50- A personalized thank you card, homemade candy, and a 12x8 matte photo print out of my portfolio. Since I’m putting all of my skills out there I figured I’d offer some of my photography experience. If you can donate $50 to my cause I will send you a link to my portfolio where you can choose which photo you would like as a print.
 
$100- A personalized thank you card, homemade candy, and a 12x18 matte photo print.
 
$150- A personalized thank you card, homemade candy and an 11x14 canvas print.
 
$200- A personalized Thank You card, homemade candy, and my design services. This includes things like logos, shirts, business packages (envelope, stationery, and business card), etc.
 
$250- A personalized thank you card and a gift basket including homemade candy, a small photo print, baked goods and other various goodies. It’s a gift basket after all you have to be a little surprised at least.
 
$500- A personalized thank you card, homemade candy, a photo print of your choosing in any size you would like and either my design services or a gift basket.
 
$1000- Everything! Literally everything I have listed here. The thank you card, the candy, the photo print, the gift basket, my design services,  my eternal thanks, and if there is something else I can think of that too!
 So, there it is. my story, what I would like to get out of this campaign, and what I want to give you in return. Remember anything you can give is greatly appreciated. If you can’t give financially I would be grateful to you if you could spread the word. Even if I don’t make my goal, any money at all will still help me make progress. Any progress I can make on this issue will lead to major improvements in my quality of life. Thank you so much in advance! I look forward to updating you all soon.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Malawi's Lost Years, 1964-94</h3>
<p><i>""Bay

<p>He who gives the blow
forgets; he who carries the scar remembers.</p>
<p>(Haitian Creole proverb)</p>
<p>  2014 is the 50<sup>th</sup> year since
independence from British colonial rule and the 20<sup>th</sup> year since the
dictator, Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda and his cronies were forced from power by a democratic
vote following a popular uprising and mounting international pressure. For 30
years, from 1964 to1994, Malawi suffered under the iron fist of Dr Banda. No
opposition or even criticism was tolerated and his rule was marked by arbitrary
arrest, detention, torture, political murder and a reign of terror that
enforced silent suffering on the people and forced many to flee into exile.</p>

  The Banda
regime created its version of history that exalted the dictator and erased this
dark side of his rule. Here we present the untold stories which represent the
missing link in the continuum of Malawi’s history. Doug and Kapote have been
interviewing survivors who suffered under the regime and want to publish their
stories.<p></p><p>WHO ARE WE?</p><p><u>Doug Miller</u> – Originally from Ottawa, Doug was teaching in Malawi from 1968 to 1972 when he married Nellie Saka, a fellow teacher from Kasungu. He was CUSO Country Director for a year in 1975-76 but had to flee into exile because the level of oppression had become unsafe and unbearable. There, he became active in LESOMA, the Socialist League of Malawi. In the early 1990's, Doug and Nellie were deeply involved in the Malawi Action Committee and the Canadian Friends of Malawi, advocating and lobbying governments and international organisations to bring about an end of the Banda dictatorship.
<u>Archibald Kapote Mwakasungura</u> – Kapote was a student activist who fled Malawi for
exile in Tanzania in October 1964 as Kamuzu Banda installed his brutal
dictatorship. Kapote lived and studied in Dar es Salaam and later taught at the
Mzumbe Institute of Development Management in Morogoro. In 1974 he was a
founding member of LESOMA along with his colleagues, John Jando Nkhwazi, William
Chisausau Msowoya and Mundu Mwambetania. LESOMA quickly became the most
effective political opposition of Malawians in exile and Kapote served as the
highly respected Secretary General until the democratic dispensation in 1992-94
ended the Banda tyranny. He then became a key player in shaping the democratic
transition and the constitution of the second republic and served briefly as
High Commissioner to Zimbabwe from 1995 to April 1998. He is now retired, and
although almost blind, is active in Karonga as Chairman of the Cultural and
Museum Centre of Karonga and Group Village Headman of Kasoba.</p><p>WHY IS THIS BOOK IMPORTANT?</p><p></p><p>This

independence to the implantation of the dictatorship and now under a twisted
and distorted democracy.</p>

  We are
indignant that the current leadership of Malawi has been rehabilitating Banda's
image and honouring him despite the well documented reports of the regime's
atrocities and abuse of human rights. We know many people who suffered or died
at Banda's hands and feel it important to redress this unfair revision of
Malawian history. This rehabilitation of Kamuzu Banda and his record is wiping
out some 30 years of history as though it had never happened. The Malawi people
continue to suffer in absolute poverty and in greater numbers than ever, while
the political leadership, mostly dynastic inheritors follow in
Banda's footsteps. The culture of impunity, the high-level corruption, and
official amnesia is what Banda used to make himself fabulously wealthy and is
the pattern emulated by today's leaders. We feel it is imperative to speak out
to remove this atrocious blind spot.<p></p><p>OBJECTIVE</p><p></p><p>Our

as possible both inside and outside Malawi. By publishing it locally in Malawi,
we can keep the cost low, so that poorer Malawians can afford to buy it. For

$15000, we plan to distribute a copy to every secondary and post-secondary

their own people and commit atrocities with impunity. These are not easy

I've been a musician almost my whole life. I started at the age of 8 years old. I started taking a music class in elementary school and it was something that I was truly passionate about right off. But my music class was only one hour a week because the school system didn't think it was important enough to spend more money on it. It wasn't enough time to really learn anything. And its not like I had an option to take a drum class after school either, because not a lot of people can spend the kind of money it takes to have enough equipment to start a class. I would drive my sisters crazy because I would bang on the snare drum all day as loud as I could,( dreaming of one day becoming a rock star ) so eventually they would make me quit playing! Skip forward over 20 years and it hasn't changed much. If your in elementary school you don't get but one hour once a week and that's it. Its a shame. Most kids love to learn and play music at that age. There creativity bone is going crazy. I handed my youngest daughter a set of sticks one night to play on some drums and she was able to play a simple drum beat within minutes, just like i did at her age. Its amazing to me, that kids can be so tuned-in just by watching me for a couple minutes. So I'm here to do something about it. I'm working toward an after school program for children of all ages to come learn and most importantly have fun. I want to help inspire the next generations great musicians. I want to help these kids be apart of something they will never forget.</p><p>Now just because I love to play and have a real passion to do this, doesn't automatically make me qualified to teach a class, but my experience does. I've got over 20 years of music in my pocket , plus 5 years of teaching. I've never held a class before but ive taught kids over the years at my home, plus we have to start some where in life, right? There is only two things I've ever been great at, one is I'm a knowledgeable musician, two is I'm great with kids. I have the patience to sit down with a child and get them to understand what it is I'm teaching them. I'm a motivated man with a mission to "" Help keep music Alive"". But as great as it all sounds I can't do it by myself, I need help getting started. I do have some equipment but nowhere near enough. Its going to take quite a bit of money to get all the instruments and accessories we are going to need. Plus I do have a wife and three kids so I can't pour all my own money into it, although I will most likely do so. I don't know if coming to this site will even help me get my goal but if I'm able to raise even $500 then it will have been worth it. What ever help we get( No matter how great or small of donations we achieve ) will go towards equipment needed to teach a class of at least ten. I know we can do this people. If I can volunteer my time and money then im sure we can do great things for these kids.So, if you can find it in your heart to take a chance and help what little bit you can, it will not only bring a smile to a child's face, but possibly change their lives. Just remember, it might be my dream but it is a child's happiness that we are really giving here. Thank You for reading this and God Bless.
